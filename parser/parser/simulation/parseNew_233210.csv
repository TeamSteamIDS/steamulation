												This game could be the single reason I may never pre-purchase anything again.  While this developer has put out some VERY nice work in the past Air Conflicts: Vietnam isn't one of them.  There are two huge flaws that are pretty much impossible to overlook.  The first one that really hits you in the face are the small maps.  Imagine trying to fly a jet inside the airspace of a tennis court.  Then imagine trying to fight a battle in that same cramped space.  its not very practical.  So you spend much of the game flying out of bounds which is no fun and I would say makes the game unplayable.  Second are the graphics.  They didn't look that stellar in the trailers but I will normally ignore minor graphic issues in exchange for good game play. Unfortunately the graphics are far worse than in the trailers.  Jaggy beyond redemption is probably the best term to describe it and no GPU or tweaking is going to fix it.  Air Conflicts: Vietnam would need a complete overhaul of its graphics and maps to be reasonably playable.  Hopefully the developer will eventually roll out some patches to make this a more enjoyable game.  It could happen, I guess, but right now the game isn't ready for prime time.			"

												I can't recommend this game. Graphically it's very messy for something this recent. Controls wise it is likewise messed up, without much functionality for changing the axis of various manuevers. In the jets, C-123 etc, there isn't even an independent rudder/aileron control that I've found-so if you pull up then want to roll, it ends up sending you in some crazy direction of its own devising. (I've played it with mouse/keyboard and 360 controller; it's possible that it's better/more adjustable with a joystick but the game turned me off so much I didn't go to the trouble of plugging in my stick)The maps are tiny (so tiny that in a jet, I went from out of bounds to out of bounds in less than 10 seconds while trying to kill a MiG) and the voice acting is corny at best. I hoped that the helicopter mode would be better, but no. Clunky controls, no way to change rudder/attitude controls, massively sluggish yaw. No challenge in attack chopper so far-you sit back in your AH-1 and lob in rockets from way outside the range of the enemy.This game would have been good ten or fifteen years ago. As a 2013 title, noooo way.Definitely not worth $30; I would probably still regret this purchase if it was $10. Very disappointed.			"

												Air Conflicts: Vietnam is an arcade flying game published by bitComposer Games. It is the next installment in the Air Conflict series.Air Conflict: Vietnam has good potential, but it's not great, I don't even think this one is good. I think compared with Air Conflict: Secret Wars, this... Air Conflict: Vietnam is the worst. The gameplay is kinda familiar with the previous game, which is the reason why this game is bad. You can't threat jet fighter the same as those world war II planes! I can't even tell if my missiles are locking on their target or not! I miss my missile fire 90% of the time! There is also this new helicopter mode, which is not really fun to play. The control is very bad, like... uncontrollable! There is also this crop duster thing mission where you spray what... a fertilizer? Okay it's actually poison, a biological warfare, but still, spraying style mission?Air Conflict: Vietnam graphics is... well they're kinda great, looks good a bit. Maybe it's the only good thing about this game. Performances? I feel it's not very smooth. I played this in one hour, doing some mission and then I can't. I just don't want to play it anymore.Air Conflict: Pacific Carriers was great. It was very fun and very epic. This sequel is very disappointing. Maybe they should stick with the world war II era. No, I don't like this. I don't recommend this.Rating 2/10			"

												The bad:* Boring repetitive gameplay.* Bad AI.* Tiny maps.* Awful quality of maps (ground textures are ugly, lack of objects).* Graphics are not good (it may looks good on screenshots, but it ugly in motion) - trees and clouds are just plane sprites (reminds me of 2000th).* Lack of achievements.* No replay value.* No simulator control scheme for gamepad.* Dead and pointless multiplayer.* Story. Your alter ego is muted. Why Thompson fight for so long? For what? There is no answer.The good:* Soundtrack.* Relatively long campaign.* About 20 authentic planes and copters.* You can control up to 6 various aircraft at single mission and switch them freely.* Random rescure MIA pilots from your squad are interesting for first 1-2 times.Some additional thoughts: This game has somekind of historical accuracy: Americans are bad - bombing civilians, spreading agent orange, napalming villages. But if you don't like to be bad, you don't like to play this game. Well, if you American - you may like such ""patriotism"". It is the worst game of the Air Conflicts series. If you want to get flight arcade game look at HAWX1-2 (better graphics, better gameplay, better replay value) or Ace Combat (fun gameplay).I think it is very mediocre - this game is surely not my best buy.Metacritics score: ~44 (http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/air-conflicts-vietnam) "

												There are good and bad things about this game but overall I like it. Most people who have posted reviews have only played about 25% of the game. What they say is not 100% true and you cannot take what they say as a good representation of the full game. I have completed the game and so I can give you a more complete review. This game, though I do love it, is not worth the [current] £22.99 price tag. If you like the look of this game, wait until it is on sale. I will start off by saying that this is not a realistic ‘simulator’. I normally prefer realistic games but I find this one really fun. Plus there is not much choice for games set in this era, so we cannot be picky. It is however, very authentic while not being entirely realistic and I think this is one of its greatest strengths. In addition to all the good and bad points I will make about this game, I would like to mention a few interesting things which may be overlooked. I have posted them separately here as I feel they are especially noteworthy:As a nod to their Second World War games you can find the wrecks of an F4U Corsair and an A6M Zero. If you collect them and complete the mission they will then be added to your inventory and you can fly them in custom battles.Air to air missiles were still unreliable in Vietnam. To illustrate this the game gives you the option to change between five different accuracy settings. You can chose to make it realistic or just play it easy with 100% accuracy.Every plane and helo has its own realistic cockpit which is well modelled. You can also look around them using the directional view controls.All missions require you to use more than one aircraft. You could be ferrying troops around in a Huey, then switch to an AH-1 Cobra and lay waste to the NVA at the LZ. Then switch back to the Huey and land your troops.The following points will be the main positive aspects of the game and specifically what I like about it from my stand point (liking more realistic games):Damage models of aircraft are authentic with the exception of the helos which are like flying tanks. Though if they were not it would make the missions impossible. For example the F-100 is well represented compared to the F-105 which is capable of sustaining a lot more damage. The visual model also reflects damage taken.Though the flight models are arcady there is an hair of realism here also, with the handling and performance of aircraft being authentically depicted.Weaponry the aircraft carry is true to the era and is portrayed well in game. The armament of aircraft is true to their real life counterparts, like the four Colt Mk 12 cannons present on the F-8 Crusader. There are also many types of ordnance in game including; unguided and guided bombs, rockets, Agent Orange and Napalm. Armaments and ordnance also all have realistic ammo counts. Though the lack of an AIM-7 Sparrow leaves you just the AIM-9 Sidewinders and your gun(s) for aerial combat.There are a lot of ground units and planes which are all very well modelled in game. You will most likely get acquainted with these fairly quickly. Just like the real war in Vietnam, this game heavily features ground attack and support missions. Sometimes you will go missions without seeing a MiG of any kind. I feel that this realistically represents the air war in Vietnam but it may be a thing to keep in mind, if you just want to kill planes. Though there is an instant action game mode where you can just fight AI.The missions are varied and the terrain looks good. The campaign is about 8-9hrs long and takes you from the very start of the war, right to the end. This sees you participate in a wide array of famous events of the war including the Tet Offensive and Hamburger Hill. Missions are plentiful in number and type here and show a side to the Vietnam War which is not often seen.To address some of the common complaints about this game; the controls are a little strange but after a little while you get used to them. It is perfectly playable with mouse and keyboard, though controller support is also available. The map areas are small only in some missions, keep playing and you will see that is far from the norm. In a lot of missions I never saw the edges of the map.This does not mean the game is without flaws though. There are also a lot of strange things the devs did which could be considered as flews that I will address here also:The AI is not that great. They only serve to be a threat to you when they are either; in great numbers or attacking aircraft you have to protect. Though this is not a problem, as I have mentioned killing MiGs is not the main portion of this game. In the custom battles against them you can ramp up their number to make it more challenging but even then…it is still not that great.The missions sometimes start you facing the opposite way to the direction you are meant to be heading.They obviously used a lot of assets from their previous Second World War titles and this ends up with some odd experiences. There are a few different USN ships in game but apart from the USS Enterprise they are all Second World War destroyers and submarines. The US also use Sherman tanks but the devs took the time to make T-55s, PT-76s and ZSUs for the NVA. Even then, for some reason the NVA sometimes use Second World War Japanese tanks!There is a part in the game where an NVA soldier is talking but he is clearly speaking Japanese and not Vietnamese.The description for the F4U Corsair on the carrier is actually for a F4F Wildcat.When in the gunner view in helos you can throw M67s to kill tanks with a single hit (though your MG will kill them eventually too). Also you use an M2 50.cal and not the iconic M60 so synonymous with the Vietnam War and the UH-1 Huey.When you pass other planes and helos at close range it sounds like you are passing a prop plane. Not a jet or helo.The voice acting and overall plot is pretty bad. Though what they were going for is a true story and highlights many aspects of the US populous feelings toward the Vietnam War. It was ultimately executed poorly and could have been much better.You play the role of a USN pilot but like the story, it is more of a reason to put you in the war. In reality you fly a multitude of USN and USAF aircraft. This means aircraft like F-100s and F-105s are seen on the deck of the USS Enterprise in the menu screens.You do not get to pick your aircraft for the missions, not even when you replay them. This is not a terrible thing though as you are given the planes you need, with the payloads you need to do the missions. Though the timing is strange when the game changes your an aircraft sometimes. For example; one mission starts off bombing in an F-4 Phantom, some MiGs roll in and now you are flying A-4 Skyhawks… The bad AI makes this playable but it just struck me as very strange.Multiplayer does not work unless you are in the beta version. This Beta also adds features not in the standard version.The cut scene graphics are worse than the in-game ones (not saying those are bad) and they often look out of focus or blurry.With all of these problems, I just found it hilarious that there is a wide array of sea life in the Gulf of Tonkin which is only seen in one mission. Whales, dolphins…it just makes me think ‘why did they not model an M48 Patton instead?’I hope this review helped you and please take into consideration everything I have said before you decide to make the purchase.

												Air Conflicts: Vietnam is disappointing to me seeing as I really liked the previous Air Conflicts games. The previous games were all about fast arcade-style air-to-air and air-to-ground combat in large open arenas, and Vietnam basically gets all of those points wrong. The maps are very small and often obscured by low fog, so you're constantly going past the map's walls. The controls are fiddly and strange, nothing at all like the fluidity of Air Conflicts: Pacific Carriers (which I think is the high point of the franchise).By far the worst thing about the game is that it interrupts gameplay to deliver cutscenes after the completion of each goal, and these interruptions are frequent. Your goal might be to take out three AA emplacements — which you'll get done within 1-3 minutes since the maps are so small — and then you'll sit through a 20 or 30 second cutscene with hammy voice acting. This will happen about five times per mission.Give this a miss and try out Pacific Carriers instead. Secret Wars is okay too. I regret buying this game.			"

												I was hopeful when I purchased this game. I am a fan of (modern-era) flight sims and I've sunk plenty of time into playing and replaying the Ace Combat games on consoles.Unfortunately, I came away very disappointed by this game. It's simply... not fun.While some games don't look very pretty in screenshots, but look amazing in-game, Air Conflicts unfortunately suffers the opposite: its screenshots do tend to look very pretty. But in the game, they don't feel as nice as the screenshots make them out to be.There are also bugs aplenty and I've gotten completely stuck with my objectives before, requiring me to restart the entire mission again (after which I just stopped playing).The maps are far too small to feel like you are an air superiority fighter. Go near top speed, and  you'll have to turn right around again because you've flown past the map's boundaries. Ground target missions for anything except helicopters are absolutely rubbish. Take note, game developers, you do not want your players to feel♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off because clunky controls make accomplishing tasks harder.The story and voice acting are a joke, although the attempt is noticeable. (Paradox, I know.)In conclusion, there are far better ways to spend your time. Don't waste it by playing this. Also, its price as it is now is absolutely ridiculous. I got it in a bundle with several other games for less than $5. Even so, it's still not worth playing.			"

Posted: July 12, 2015
												Review based on the current beta build at the time of this review.A game that could have been better, the graphics aren't bad and the era is one not often seen in flight games.  I had written an initial ""not recommended"" review but retracted it when they released a beta patch adding a new flight model and some other changes in order to give it a 2nd chance.  However it must be said that there is  still more wrong than right with this game. JET FLIGHT: You have two choices of which are flying like a car, or flying with a buggy ""simulation"" mode in which aircraft controls don't function properly.  For some examples: applying right rudder has 0 yaw effect and will roll your plane over toward the left, or how banking can have little or no effect on turning.HELO FLIGHT: Large improvement over pre-beta.  Helicopter flight actually felt decent and the bindings were an improvement from before.  The main bother here is the dodge mechanic which lets the helo suddenly jerk left or right.  It doesn't look so bad in cockpit view but out of cockpit it looks ridiculous.WEAPONS: Very auto-aim based, get in the general proximity with the sight and watch the bullets fly from your jet as if they were coming from a turret in the nose.  Missiles can be adjusted to varying degrees of accuracy, generally not an issue.  Bomb view is limited to straight flight when in simulation, no rudder control due to the bug for fine adjustments.  Applying rudder or banking will pull you out of bomber view.  This game would strongly benefit from the option to use a mouse for the door gunner while using a flightstick for the helicopter as well.AI: Not much to say but if you control any aircraft during mission the AI will no longer function on that aircraft for the remainder of said mission.  (That aircraft will just keep flying straight.)STORY: The story really had no draw to it, you hear the narration of some letters from the main pilot and to the main pilot as well as the general briefing for missions but they lack any emotional draw and just didn't engage me as a player.  On another down note to story there is almost no radio chatter during missions to draw you into the story and it creates a very hard separation between the missions and the cuts between them.  What little chatter there is is comparable to the the movie Sharknado and the cuts during missions feel just as dry and out of context as the cuts inbetween missions.Overall the gameplay in simulation is undesireable due to the current bugs with no sign of developer feedback.  Unfortunately while arcade works better I have serious issues calling games with the ""flying car"" model of flight a flight game in this day and age.  Air Conflicts Vietnam is a game that has or had a lot of potential that just isn't coming through.  Is it redeemable, I'd say yes... however it will take more than I believe they are willing to do at this stage considering they have mentioned work on an expansion.  In its current state this game comes off as dry, repetitive, buggy, pretty  much uninteresting, and I just can't recommend it.			"

												I've played a lot of flight games, arcade and sims both. This really is not on the same level as Pacific carriers or Secret wars.  Maps that are too small, graphics that don't hold up visually at close range, and the entirety of the gameplay feels like a bunch of quick-time events. They build up the complexity of the mission in the briefing, but then you drop one bomb on a location and you're instantly into the next phase. Helo controls are not good at all, the F-4 is too fast to stay in the map, missile targetting is non-existent, and the wingmen do nothing but chase the seven or eight enemy that all gang up on you alone. They don't even fire on them! Door-gunning in the Huey is laughable, using an MG to blast open an armored ZSU-23-4? Rail shooters never looked so boring.On the point of controls, I have to complain heavily on the fact that I can't seem to alter the keyboard assignments at all, yet the landing gear (which you NEVER USE TO LAND) are on the same key as the after-burners?  Was this a test by the programmers to see how frustrated they can make their users with a little flashing ""gear down"" indicator every time they try to chase down an enemy?Finally, the story. Yes, Vietnam was a mistake. Yes a lot of people died for ridiculous reasons. I can even go along with a family's fears because their sons are off fighting, it's dramatic. But you really don't need to bemoan the pointlessness of the war while forcing me to endure such a painfully sub-par game. It's a bit redundant. After six missions, I started skipping the depressing commentary entirely. You wasted money and time on your writers, folks.And they still have the gall to charge 29.99?  I'm glad I got it on a Steam Sale for dirt cheap.			"

												I guess I'm going to be the first to deviate from all the negative reviews for this interesting title.In short I'd recommend this game to anyone that's looking for a flight arcade title set during the beautiful backdrops of the Vietnam War. I give a lot of credit towards the developers with the wide range of assorted aircraft during the 60's/70's. The soundtrack is good or unique in a sense ,yet after a couple missions they get really beaten to death since they wrote original songs for this game with some range of genres too. I'll be honest by saying that the story isn't interesting at all even though I'm not that far into the game. Some other things that bother me with what the developers did was mainly the grid they put into each of the combat airspaces giving you only so much room to fly yet it's not all that bad, but it takes away from ""some"" of the immersion. Graphically this game is beautiful despite all the nay-sayers are saying how this seems dated which on the ground it does but its really gorgeous up in the skies of vietnam while you're chasing screaming Migs. Another small thing that bothers me too is during helicopter gameplay your seated in the Co-Pilot seat of lets say the Hueys and Chinooks when in reality they should of had you sitting in the actual pilot seat.These are just some of the things that popped at me with my short time of playing this but I'm going to enjoy it nonetheless.If you are on the fence about picking this title up my best advice is to wait for it to be on sale instead of paying full price since you don't have too much to loose.

												This isn't a very serious game, and the storyline is really bad. I wish there was a mission at the end to kill my supposed family, who get more and more namby-pamby and anti-war as the game goes on. However, the music is great. All those 70's songs, even though they are constantly repeated, get you right into the time period. On the other hand, there's all these really crappy Huey door gunner sequences that make me want to scream. AAAAHHH! They detract massively from the Cobra sequences. With a Cobra, all you do is just fire Hydra rockets and pulverise everything. Its great funThe jet fighter sequences are a bit lame. The MIG's are OP as it gets, and the missiles DO NOT WORK.  "

												I've enjoyed the Air Conflict series since the first game was released, so don't get me wrong here. I enjoy the Vietnam addition, however there are some issues that take away from enjoying this title compared to it's predecessors. I'll keep this short and simple. There are some of the most iconic planes and helicopters in the post WWII era, and they have managed to do a good job in the graphic and loadout department. The size of the conflict zones is sometimes so small, that you find yourself constantly having to manuever your aircraft to avoid going, ""out of bounds"", as it were. This drastically lowers the possible enjoyment of many campaign scenarios, which I find frustrating. I haven't tried the multiplayer so I can't speak for that part, as of yet, but unfortunately I find myself on the edge of a question. Would I recommend this game to a friend? Sadly, the answer is no but, once again, I'm on the fence here. Whereas I find many aspects of the gameplay questionable another person may love it. So, who am I to say, ""don't purchase this game"". Well, so much for short and simple. Also, I can't quite place my finger on it, but there's just something missing in this Vietnam release.			"

												I would like to recommend this game.  It does have potential for the casual combat flight game.  It is NOT a sim by any definition I would use.  However it can be fun.  That being said, I have found that many people are in the same situation that I find myself.  Operation Gamewarden is a two part mission.  The first part you are flying a F-4 Phantom.  Not bad.  The second part you are flying a Chinook low to drop seals and must remain undetected.  The helicopter controls are a bit clunky but with some work you can get the hang of them. After spending more time than I care to admit trying to complete this mission, I have given up.  It seems rediculous that this game is ruined by one impossible mission.  One mission that you can't just skip.  I really would have liked to seen what else this game held, but I think the ""Cong"" made this game so only they can win.			"

												Despite what the title may suggest, this game is not pro war. At the end of the campaign, you will understand the personal turmoil of the pilot, the events surrounding the war and the stresses it brought down to his family.If your rig can run this game at decent frame rate of 30fps at minimum detail levels, you will get very smooth & responsive mouse flight. Anything higher than that would be awesome, i think, because ACV uses dense particle effects and high quality global lighting by default. Hence even at minimun settings you'll get dense, visibility impacting cloud cover, dense missile trails, glare and shadow effects in the cockpit as your plane changes orientation with respect to the sun.Voice acting is occassionally not very convincing but it's above average for the most part. However in-flight com chatter is seriously lacking; there's no difference between American & Vietnamese pilots. There's only one voice for all the pilot chatter in dogfights and they say exactly the same things! I dunno why the developers skimp on this when clearly they have more than one voice actor employed for the entire game as can be seen in the credits and clearly heard in some parts of the game.  Operation Breakfast aka Menu Menu music & cinematic music are the some of the best i've ever heard. Mission music and intrument quality seems to be appropriate to the time period and probably reflect what American soldiers listen to at the time. Cinematic cut scenes is where this games really shines and there's plenty of those. Although scene quality is generally a little blurry, it includes all the graphic elements ACV is capable of producing. It was the amazing trailer that sold me to ACV despite the 'mostly negative' overall rating and i'm glad i gave it a shot or two.ACV falls into the arcade classification but don't be put off by that, it's actually well balanced between simulation & arcade and a lot of fun. There's plenty of high quality content in this game and i'm very happy with this purchase 'coz i got it at a huge discount. Yes many people mentioned about the tiny mission areas but that only seem to be present in the first & second missions. Furthermore the grid boundaries is not a physical barrier so you won't bounce off of it nor would your plane explode on contact so it's not a big issue. Just slow down near the boundaries.This is an action simcade with a little strategic tactical twist. You can fly any plane in your sortie. In fact, it is quite necessary in order to succeed in the missions because critical jobs like taking out AA guns or Rocket Propelled Grenade launchers (RPG) are not efficiently tackled by your wingmen and also because you can't give order to them. Another aspect of strategy is that you can rotate the crew roster though i dunno how important is this. My guess is that it would affect the fatigue factor. It would also be necessary i think to rotate other pilots into active duty so that if a skilled pilot gets killed, the replacement won't be a total rookie.  There are 4 difficulty levels; easy, medium (holiday pilot), hard (civil pilot) & nightmare (navy pilot). I can't detect any difference in AI between these levels but what's apparent is that the enemies have tougher armour further up in the difficulty scale but friendlies seem to have the same armor making them vulnerable and an easy kill at nightmare level.There is no manual in the game folders nor key listing in-game. Fortunately the early part of the campaign introduces you to most of the keys you need to know. Example, i found out by assumption that 'C' toggles camera views. Frankly, ACV almost made me want to rush out and grab the latest PC but i'm holding out for now. It's that good; the trailer is an accurate representation of what you can expect during gameplay but in-game image quality is much finer unlike most games where the trailer is just an overhyped, souped-up version that bears little resemblance to the actual gameplay. Few game ever made me feel the need to upgrade like this one does.One last pointer; flight control is way smoother than Top Gun Hardlock so you know this is a good flight game.Rating: 8/10The rating above still stands despite mentioning a few negatives in my last edit mainly because flying using the mouse is sheer pleasure. This has to be one of the smoothest mouse flight control in any flight game. ACV Operation Ranch Hand [www.dailymotion.com] "

Posted: July 3, 2014
												Summary:  Good in concept, poor in execution.  The game is Air Conflicts: Vietnam and it is exactly what it claims to be.  It's an arcade flying game where you use various aircraft types and styles to partake in the Vietnam war.  Your initial and very quick ""tutorial"" is based on checking out your flight controls to ensure they function properly.  It's a good way to ""hide"" a tutorial, but one problem exists that plagues every single mission in this game.  Let's talk about it...Most modern military games like those of the Battlefield series are limited by the size of map it's possible to have, and Air Conflicts: Vietnam is no different.  To keep players on the map they institute map edge boundries that will warn you first and then proceed to ""kill"" you if you remain off the map.  In most games this is kept tactfully in the map display as to not ruin the immersion of the player.  In this game, however, that map limit is visibly gridded in the sky and even changes to red when you get close to it.  I constantly felt like I was performing air combat inside a box rather than fighting in Vietnam, and a small box to be sure.  That's my next complaint.  For a game where FLIGHT is the main form of travel, the map areas are EXTREMELY small.  I found myself having to climb and then dive at bombing targets because there really was no way to setup a decent bombing run.The graphics, sounds, and other things in the game are really nicely done.  I really liked how the ground was laid out, with trees, camps, and proper texturing of the foliage.  It was very well done in that respect.  Sadly you rarely got to see any of it because you were constantly avoiding running into the walls in the sky.  If I could say one thing to the developers it would be to enlarge the maps.  Everything else is beautiful, but the small map size turned me away from this game in under 15 minutes of playing (4 missions completed).Because of that, I'm sorry to say, this is one game I can't recommend and am glad I got it as part of a bundle.

												Reports of this game's flaws are largely exaggerated.In the case of Air Conflicts: Vietnam while many of the complaints are valid they are also blown way out of proportion. The game's controls are a tad on the sensitive side and take some adjusting to, but they are simple and easy to learn. I have yet to run into a mission I could not complete, although the allied AI is certainly useless 99% of the time, but this does not stop the game from being enjoyable. The soundtrack is great, if not a little repetative. This is definitely not Ace Combat, but it also doesn't need to be to do what it does well. Pros:-Good Soundtrack-Good mix of fighter, bomber, attack helo, and support helo-Simple Controls for easy access to non-simulator flying fansCons:-Brainless ally AINeeds Work:-Voice Acting-Script Writing(generally we call it anti-air and not double A)Overall, if you want a period game that you can quickly pick up play for a bit and then put down without a hastle, this is it. Though I suggest grabbing it when it's on sale, like I did, it's fun just not full price game fun.			"

												Great idea, nice to see nam era aircraft modeled so nicely.  The main issue is lack of room on the maps when flying jets.  You spend more time staying within boundries than actually doing anything.  Bombing runs are an exercise in frustration.			"

												I've had a very short time on this game, but enough to notice that is game is not very good. The controls feel sluggish and the camera is tough to control. The flight area is small and enimies fly out of it quite a bit. A feature that could be fixed is the bomb and missle cam. The plane or helicopter is still in motion while you follow the bomb and missile. This alone caused me to die quite a few times in the tutorial.Final Verdict: Do not buy this game.			"

												Right, spent about 30 minutes getting the control system right for a gamepad. That was tedious. Afterwhich the game was visually pretty good, story was just painfull (by which i mean voice acting, etc) but thats not why you buy a flight game. Its all about the gameplay: which is ok generally but really rough around the edges. Cant get past the second mission as its a helicopter mission and the controls are so bad that I cant hit the targets. And I've logged into the 100 hours on battlefield 3/4 so I know how a helicopter works, or should work. It should be able to turn on the spot (nope, has to reverse at the same time apparantly). It should be able to stop or hold a rough position (nope, its always going forwards, unless you turn, in which case see above). It should be able to adjust speed relitive to pitch (sort of, you can nose forward, but this doesnt affect altitude, but you go charging ahead, though with almost complete loss of controll for aiming). Flying a Jet is too arcade for me, the AI sticks to one altitude as the jets auto level when you turn (so no banking and turning manually) and while it handles ok otherwise, it just makes for very boring dog fights which turn into dodgems at high altitude with no climbing or diving. So bassically dull, or unplayable from my perspective. Will soldier on a bit more, but jesus I need to make that helicopter stop first.			"

												I do recommend this game, but with some significant reservations:1) Buy it when it's on sale.2) Understand that the game is not so much ""good"" as ""interesting.""This game seems like it was meant to be built on previous lessons from the ""Air Conflicts"" series. The problem is that it all fails to truly come together as a whole. As a result, the game is strangely ""uneven."" For instance:The helicopters are fun to fly and fight in, but the jets manage to be both bland and ""twitchy"" at the same time.Air to ground combat works well enough, but air-to-air combat suffers from the jets being tough to finesse in a dogfight. The ""Cannon Lock"" mechanic seems like it could have been very cool, yet it ends up just being bizarre - determining what will bring about cannon hits and what won't is hard to determine.It seems like the developers were going for slightly higher production values this time around. However, there are lots of little mistakes, like subtitles being overlaid on video with ""baked in"" subtitles already present.The environments are detail rich...but awfully cramped, especially when high-speed jets are involved.The game seems to be meant to be dramatic, but the missions never manage to impart a sense of urgency or danger. (There's real frustration, though, when in one mission the MiG fighters are bugged in a way that lets them tear past you at incredible speed. They then proceed to rip through the bombers you're escorting...)It seems that the developers wanted to tell a good story, but they managed to miss the boat by shoehorning an individual pilot's experiences into highly impersonal gameplay. (They handled their storytelling FAR better in ""Secret Wars."") The writing and acting for the story bits also seems to be overdone - a little too melodramatic at times.The ""squad"" mechanic shows promise, and it could have been great if it was really key to success in detailed, demanding missions...yet it ends up feeling mostly unnecessary.It all adds up to a game that's fun to try, but not at full price. The effort is commendable, but (as I said before) the game seems like a bunch of potentially cool bits that never actually became cohesive.			"

												Overall a pretty fun flight sim, however the helicopter missions can be a bit tedious. The story makes you feel slightly guilty about happily gunning down vietcong on missions by reminding you that your family is slowly drifting away from you and joining the anti-war movement. The game's soundtrack, however, seems a bit out of place. For the ideal Vietnam experience, mute the music and put on Spotify 60's radio station instead. :)			"

												I could list every single problem of this game here,but the review would be huge, so I will point out the ""highlights"".First off, BUGS, loads of them, some missions are impossible to complete because of these bugs.Second, this game gets repetitive and tiresome, i spent 71 minutes on this game praying to all gods that it would end after the next mission, sadly it didn't...But the multiplayer is really cool to play, but then again ALL servers are empty so good luck trying to find a match.Overall if you have a lot of friends to play multiplayer with you, MAYBE this game is worth buying, but i would not recommend it.

												This game is kinda average if not to say worse. Friendly AI does not even think and refuses to do anything except for flying around and hovering in the same place until you take control (you can switch between your unit's machines), missions can be buggy, graphics are not Crysis-like. But I still wasted a whole day playing it, so it can be fun if you are into the Vietnam War, love war machines, atmosphere and music of that time period. Still fun despite its poor realization, 7/10 for all the atmosphere but they had to fix the darn AI and sell it cheaper.			"

												About the best I can say for this is it LOOKS good, until you realise your ""flying area"" or game area is the size of a postage stamp. It`s not a patch on Air conflicts secret war, that games actually fun.I selected dogfight in this and am still looking for someone to shoot at, I guess they forgot to put adversaries in there or they`re so scared of my awesome flying skills they`ve all scarpered....You WILL spend most of your time turning around and flying in circles in this game to keep in that ridiculously small playing area, you can literally start at one end, count to ten and you have to turn around again or the game ends.Thumbs down.Edit:-I came back to take a look at this title as I`d heard that a lot of work had been done, the game had been updated and everything was peaches and cream... and tickety boo.Don`t believe a word of it.SAME teeeeny tiny ""battle area"" and no discernable changes, AT ALL.When I selected single player,  the game ASKED me what aeroplane I wanted to fly and accepted the input of ""F4 Phantom""... - either they don`t know what F4 phantoms look like or theres another bug as the plane displayed was a sabre..   I also noticed that despite selecting ""Instant dogfight"" there was absolutely no sign anywhere of an opponent, so exactly the same issues I saw when I first purchased this game are still there.I timed myself flying from one side to the other in a sabreIt took 28 seconds...28 seconds to fly across your entire game area....Keep flying and it ends the game and throws you out.If there are ""improvements"", I`d love to know where they are, because to my eyes this game is exactly the same rubbish I voted down when I bought it.Save your money, there are FAR better games out there.

												This is arguably the worst game I have ever played, and that ain't no bullsh*t neither.I had originally played this game before now, about a year ago but noticed that the second mission, where you fly a Cobra attack helicopter that I was unable to switch to the Huey upon game demand. Keep in mind I am playing this on a Mac so I felt that maybe it was something to do with the platform, but then again, this game **is** compatible with the Mac platform.Anyway, so I posted a dicussion here, over a year ago highlighting the aforementioned issue:https://steamcommunity.com/app/233210/discussions/0/611704730315759849/Left it for a week after posting then I got bored and deleted the game off of my Steam account. Came back to the game today to try it again - who knows, maybe I missed something first time around.lol, nope.Got to the same mission, and the same problem presented. No mouse clicker on the screen to select the Huey.Go back to the same forum topic I posted and was equally amazed and appalled that NOT ONE RESPONSE BY THE ♥♥♥♥ING DEVELOPERS WAS MADE.A WHOLE YEAR.IT IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE TO GET A MOUSE TO WORK ON A GAME.IT IS NOT HARD TO PROGRAM THE MOUSE TO PERFORM BASIC FUNCTIONALITY LIKE SELECTING ANOTHER HELICOPTER.So I give this game a 3/10. The good:- Beautiful Graphics, even on Medium.- Transistion between Airplanes and Helicopters is fun.And the bad:- Developers clearly do not give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about their PAYING CUSTOMERS.- Broken game on Mac.- Awful dialogue.- Even worse control layout.Whoever coined up this game. Please. Do not make another game in your life, if you cannot be bothered to tend the games you already have. This could be a FANTASTIC game if you weren't so inattentive to your consumer needs. Either that, or do not enable multi-platform playability if you CANNOT PLAY IT.			"
