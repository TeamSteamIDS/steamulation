												There might be some nastalgia playing into my review of this game. It's recalls my favorite time in gaming, when titles like Terminal Velocity and Descent Dominated PC gaming. The tourtorial is a bit lacking so taking some time learning the controls from the options menu first will go a long way, the instant action option is a nice touch and multiplayer (with some system tweaking) is workable and entertaining at lans.To address the Negative reviews:There seems to be a trend of people assuming that this new wave of old games getting re-released on steam are similar to 'remakes' available on consoles. These are more like diving in the bargin bin at a local retailer. They aren't repolished with new fixes for modern machines, most will require a few extra steps to get running and this should be expected if you are buying anything before 2009. This one is no exception, luckily there aren't as many issues as with some other titles. I was able to get it up and running by right clicking on the gamelauncher.bat in the install folder and running as administrator. After  running it once this way it launches fine from steam. Just so you don't think I have some odd setup that might be old enough to be compatible:i7 3770k16 gigs of ddr3Geforce 780Win7 x64240gig SSD "

												An old and, for me, classic game, something of a classic example of old Russian game-design, in both good and bad senses of the term. The graphics have not aged particularly well, and the menus are sometimes a pain to navigate, but overall it remains a solid arcade-ish ""action sim"", with neat gameplay and a bit of originality, some of which has remained to this day even. There aren't a whole lot of these ""futuristic VTOL gunship"" sims on PC nowadays for some reason.In regards to the Steam release: Well, the English localization is an interesting contrast to the Russian I remember. And the game did not launch for me the first time around. It took me the unimaginably difficult effort of going to the game's install directory and running the game's launch script as an administrator to set up the necessary registry and be able to play. (:P)No, I didn't notice the line in the system requirements telling me to run the game as an administrator at first either.Not needing a CD in the drive (which this tablet doesn't have anyway) is a definite plus over the times I played it in the past though. :P			"

												Echelon is a classic flight sim similar to X-Wing, Tie-Fighter or Crimson Skies. It's fun, but often unreasonably difficult. This release, however, is broken. It runs, but requires a lot of work to get running. Buy at your own risk. Also, for some reason they replaced the old menu music with something awful.			"

												I bought it for few cents, paid too much. This is ablsolute, pure, 100% non-working s***. I tested it on windows 10 x64, windows 7 x64 sp1 and windows xp sp3 (win7 and win xp via virtualbox). The only working part of it is the *.bat file, that has to be modified in order to idle cards.

												This is an old game; I enjoyed it back in the day. I don't have any delusions about it supporting 5.1, or modern resolutions, or my xbox controller. However, it should be sold in such a state that it launches and is playable. This game can't be launched, and is not playable.(note: there are some folks having luck with a 3rd-party patch)			"

												I have had this game in my steam library for a while now. It was one of my favorite games that I used to play. But I could never get the Steam version to run. But today I came across a post by cyanic and he has made a patch to get this game to work. It was nothing less than awesome to get to play this game again. So thanks go out to cyanic for his help to Echelon gamers in the Steam Community. This game is just as good as I remember. The controls are unique and once you get used to them, very effective. Yes the graphics show a little age and the models a little dated as far as textures go. But some of the ships were and still are awesome looking ship designs. If this game could be modded with updated graphics.Maybe more detailed models or just a modern revamp of the whole game.I think it would be an instant success. With this game still being great and with the fact that you can now get the Steam version to play by running the patch that cyanic created. I couldn't imagine it not being in my collection. As of this review its only $3.99, Thats nice deal for a classic game.Be warned your going to have to run the patch to get the game to run. If your not comfortable doing this I suggest you pass on buying the game.			"

												I cannot get this to run even after trying all the fixes in the discussion forums and frankly can`t be bothered messing around with it anymore. (tried on Windows 7, 8.1 and 10 PC`s).The specs say it`ll work with windows 7 or 8.1....Ummm sorry, but no it doesn`t.Yes I tried setting the executables as admin, yes I ran the .bat file as admin & yes I tried every compatibility setting available on all the executables.It might be a good game, but I can`t recommend it as I can`t run it, and from what I`ve seen in discussion threads, MANY people are having the same issues as I am and can`t run it either.If you can accept having to (try to) fix the issues yourself, and spend a lot of time googling a solution then go for it, but be warned you might end up, (like me), wasting your money and time as no amount of tweaking or fiddling will get my copy to work..If refunds had been available when I bought this I`d have taken that option, but sadly , they weren`t and I lost my money. The Games now in my ""♥♥♥♥♥♥never to be played again"" folder.Where it belongs.			"

												Took me about 45 minutes to get the game working after trying around 10 fixes that did nothing. The game still takes 30 seconds to open with a CMD window permanently open in the background while you play... Screenshots doesn't work and the Steam Community doesn't work in game.Now I haven't played this game before, I guess that's an old game that might have been good back then... But I don't even know what i'm looking at.I strongly do not recommend to buy this game if you haven't played it previously and if you did, keep in mind you will spend a good amount of time fixing the game. Don't even ask me how I did it, I don't remember, I've tried many fixes and reinstalled the game twice.			"

												Faulty game launcher - but that's NOTHING! I was unable to play this game for over a decade! It's originally was made for Win 98 and XP patch not always worked. So setting BAT file launcher to admin permission is forgivable for me.Game is FREAKING AMAZING, both it good and bad sense. There is some parts that are outdated more than the poop of the dinosaur, but the gameplay is still AWESOME!Really complaining old good game for 1,3$ - you are insane! If you are futuristic sim-game fan - GRAB IT NOW! It's like Battletech Aerospace fighter inspired gem!			"

												OOOOkay.... so it took a while to get this to actually run...   That was very frustrating..  But..  Once you get it to work, this game is very fun.   I like the strafe left/right thrusters on the fighters and I like the levels that actually can challenge you and require skille to complete.     I'm going to recommend this title, but with a stern finger wag at steam for releasing a title that requires customers to research how to get the game to actually launch...			"

												Horrendous experience, slight rant warning !Was looking forward to some Nostalgia, to the good games of old, ...But i tried as good as everything to get it to run on my Win7 64bit system, but never succesfull.I was even expecting that an oldy like this wouldn't run smoothly on newer systems(tends to happen, not first time, not first game)But after going through this for an extended period of time, i'm throwing in the towel.I would love if one of these (or both) would occur in the future:1) devs should rlly ****ing update their games properly, so that they would/could actually run on more modern systems without too much hastle, if they want to sell their games via a Modern & Digital retailer like Steam (or GoG or ....)The current situation just screws over clients, and its purely negative bussiness.2) Valve should freaking atleast put a big warning about optimisation or compatability issues. Activly check the games they wish to sell via Steam, and put appropriate warnings in place.And yeah i hear you, they do that already, but to such a lesser degree its laughable, and definitely not activly (enough)Way too many (older) games on Steam have issues with overlay, but Valve/Steam won't warn you about that, or that a game would, for a lot of players, not launch, or crash.You only get that information from the other gamers that already smacked against that wall.Getting so darn sick of companies only purely after money & power, abandoning decency whenever it suits em, and put a tiny freaking band-aid on gushing wounds as positive PR.Now for the full experience, and the very near-future Refund ticket:1) The game wouldn't launch, even after using admin + setting compatibility to win XP Service P32) after sifting through all guides and possible unofficial fixes and patches in the discussion section and online in general, I eventually got the game to launch to the main menu (sometimes), but that’s where it would crash again, or at other times I’d only have the option to ""Exit Game"".Constantly trying to rewrite / patch the ""GameLauncher.bat"" file, to force it to work as every guide / patch tries to do, yields varying results and error messages. But I never got to see or get to actually start the game from its main menu (if I even got to the main menu)3)I’ve checked the Product Website, which yields nothing but generic game info, the Developer website is actually the Product Website, and the (supposed) Publisher, via the “Customer Support Website” doesn’t even have the game in its list of (supported) games.
