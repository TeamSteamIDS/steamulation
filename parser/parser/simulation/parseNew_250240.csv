												Not recommended.Front end( Menus etc ) needs a lot more work, feels unintuitive and overall difficult to use.changing things during the race ( such as tires ) do not seem to stick, and half the time things change on their own...They play snippets of the cars racing, while you are doing an event. This is annoying as hell, and deafening if you are wearing headphones ( Read: sudden loud F1 noise )I advise all to steer clear of this game.			"

												The interface is poorly presented and is awfully confusing. It doesn't make any attempt at explaining what all of the buttons do nor how your actions might affect the future. I spent 90 minutes clicking everything on the screen, not knowing what was interactable until I clicked on it. It did not allow you to review any of your purchases so clicking on a wrong button might result in a non-refundable purchase of something you don't need.The interface during a race was by far the worst thing. There's a bunch of icons and numbers on this screen and I still don't know what they mean. I presume that my drivers finished in dead last because they ran out of gas. Or at least that's what I think happened; my drivers had stopped moving around the track and there was a blinking icon that I think was a gas can? There was nothing that allowed me to fill up their tanks nor was there any way for me to bring them back into the pitts.Overall this game has failed to organize itself in any useful way to someone who is trying to jump in. The sheer number of options in this game requires that it be organized and easy to parse, but it has not only failed in this respect, it has not even tried.			"

												Well this is the first time I have had to write a view and the reason is that I feel so strongly that this game should not be available for purchase. It is slow, unresponsive and quite frankly unplayable. I tried so hard to enjoy the game as an avid F1 fan but its impossible. The build up to the races, and managing the team isn't too bad, you can almost look past the fact that trying to click between pages often doesnt work, but you cannot enjoy the race as it seems to go and do its own thing and doesnt respond to any of my actions. The first practice just went crazy, I couldnt tell if my drivers were on the track or not, they would talk about being sat in the pits despite me telling them to drive, the tv preview screens goes crazy flicking between different views with a constant message that the game is paused despite the clock ticking down, the icons which show tyre wear and fuel require a magnifying glass, and the constant messages from the drivers asking whats for tea or telling me their bum hurts, does little to excite me as id much prefer some feedback on how the car is performing. I cant get a refund, I feel pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and ripped off. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!			"

												Avoid this game.  If you have already brought Pole Position 2012 then this is exactly the same game albeit with a few minor screen changes.You can research the technologies you want, you can expand the team by buidling new centres.  Thats as good as it gets.It doesn't matter what you do even with the best teams and drivers you end up being 10 seconds off the pace with no clue of how to set the car up and how to actually compete with the other teams.  During a race environment your driver asks you questions which you have no method of replying to.  The cut scenes to show the action is the same clip over and over with different painted cars.  There is no easy way of transferring from one part of the team to another.  When I saw that this game was available from Kalypso I was hoping it was no just rebadged Pole Postion 2012 (Which has the same problems)  I thought that they had taken on board the problems of the earlier game and fixed them but they still have the same problems and faults.I cannot believe they think that charging £15 is a suitable price for this game. Compare this to F1 2103 which in the sales was a similar price,  They are a world apart.AVOID...AVOID...AVOID.Wish I could get my money back.			"

												Not really sure what to make of this one yet, I used to love the old Grand Prix Manager so was hoping for much of the same. It definitely has a good amount of detail to it, you can edit all existing driver and team names and details from cash to nationality to strength (whatever that is, reputation maybe?), plus you can create your own from scratch. To avoid the copyright it has those 'random but close enough that you can tell who' type names for the drivers and teams, Vettel = Bettel, Vodafone = Yodafone etc. I changed them all to the actual names for a little more realism. You can hire everyone from designers, down to pit crew. You can train drivers, both their basic driver skill and a host of special abilities like being faster in the wet, qualifying specialist, speed bonus through corners or when they're listed at #1 driver. Quite a good selection and you can build/train the exact type of driver you want. You can also have a lower formula team and a kart team to develop talent down the line, quite a nice addition so you can invest training and time in a young star. I've done one race so far after a pre season of research and development and am currently 10 seconds off the pace, not entirely sure why but maybe the other teams start off more established in their research. I hope that's all it is anyway. Like Grand Prix manager you can give your drivers orders through-out the race, from set a record lap (go mental) to basic race speed. The automatic pit stops seem a bit buggy, the drivers tend to come into the pits whenever they want, whether they have fuel or decent tyres or not, so switching that off helped. Certainly promising, very good amount of detail, random race footage that doesn't seem to show anything useful but so far it's fun and i will be playing it more.			"

												Well, despite seeing the bad reviews, I decided to buy the game and digitally download it, since it was 66% off in the sales and therefore only a fiver. I have waited for a new Formula One management game since the millennium, when “F1 Manager”, based on the 1999 season, was out and still playable. Unfortunately, time moved on and the software became out of date, I have not been able to play F1 Manager for a number of years. I decided to give this game a go, despite the lack of a license (I don’t usually buy F1 based games without a license to use the real names because it’s just rubbish), but seeing that it has an editor you could edit the names to fit the real world anyway. Below is a list of mainly negative, but also some positive things that I’ve found with the game after two days of playing it.When the game starts up, it has difficulty remembering if you have “windowed” ticked or unticked in the options menu. After each event, the window freezes. Initially I believed the game had crashed and had to force exit through task manager. This turned out to be just the game taking forever to get to grips with what you are asking it to do, although this seemed to stop once I gave the game a chance to move beyond the first quarter of the year. The game does not autosave. You have to save it after everything you do, just incase the game DOES crash.You can seem to add as many teams as you please in the editor, although it’s restricted to between 10 and 20 when you start a new game. You can seem to add as many new drivers as you please in the editor, although if you assign more than two drivers to a team, when you start a new game, it will randomly choose two drivers, rather than the first two added. So you can’t have the third one as a reserve driver. It does list all the drivers available to the team once you are in game, but obviously you have no control over which drivers begin the season with other teams.Sometimes the game does not work properly in terms of race results. If my fifth attempt to start a game, I managed to complete three races, but neither the Constructor’s Championship or Driver’s Championship have been updated (all on 0 points). In “Track Winners”, it also says Race not yet held, even though the race has been held. Whether or not the points are updated, it shows ALL drivers that have been created/already there from the editor, with the teams they are assigned to, even if those teams are not actually competing in this game. After coming out of the game, and going back in an hour later, I took part in a fourth race. After this race, it awarded points properly, but only from that race onwards. The other three races are still ignored.The “tutorials” are so beyond basic that it does not truly help you. You have to work it out for yourself. So on that basis, your team is ten seconds off the pace in every race, even if you edited the team and drivers to be 100 strength. The car set up does not bring you any closer to the field. During training, it does not offer feedback from the driver or suggestions on how to improve the car’s performance. The drivers go out on track on their own accord even after you call them back into the pits. They return to the pits, but before you can pause, they go straight back out and run out of fuel. If your car breaks down during qualifying, you cannot repair and replace the part that has broken because you are in Parc Ferme conditions. As a result, your broken car will retire after one complete lap.The main positives with the game are if you’re a fan of editing, then you should just about enjoy this. However, when editing teams, it does not tell you if any drivers are assigned to them. So if you forget, you have to go through every driver to see which team they’re put into, if they are in a team at all. Then if you’ve forgotten to assign drivers to a team, despite the vast number of custom made drivers who are “unemployed”, the new game will start with randomly named drivers signed up to the team instead.You can’t edit or create engines. So while you can put in the Renault, Mercedes and Ferrari teams, they will be handed randomly named engines that have nothing to do with any of them. Still though, you can create a team called Motori Moderni if you really wanted to! You can’t create customised team personnel either. I remember a game called Championship Manager 99/00 (a football management game) which had an editor that edited absolutely everything. I wish we could have had an editor on that scale for this game.What I decided to do was base a game on the 1993 season. All 13 1993 teams, my own custom made team and the Life team (remember them?!). The only team I could ever get near, though, was Life, because I Set them to a rating of 4/100, while the other teams were 60/100+, even though my own team was set to 100/100, as were my drivers, myself and Juan-Manuel Fangio!At this point, I do not know what happens when a driver’s contract expires from other teams. All drivers in the editor have their contracts by default set to end in December 2013 (you can extend of course), but I started a game in the year 2011, which means absolutely no one’s contracts expired and they continued into the next season. So after their contracts expire, at this point, I don’t know if the computer controlled teams hire drivers that are on the market that were made in the editor, or hire randomly named drivers. I’d like them to hire one of the 60 available drivers but unfortunately you never know what it will do.I am going to try a twenty team grid and do research from the get go, and just not bother adjusting the set up of the cars for races. It seems to be a waste of time, especially if you have no feedback on what should be adjusted.If you’re a fan of editing, then you should enjoy this game. If you also have patience to see through the bugs and just get on with it, then you should enjoy it no matter what. It’s not the best game in ever invented, and it does look a lot like Pole Position 2012 (according to screenshots on Amazon), but until someone goes out of their way to build the absolute ultimate F1 management game, like they would with football management games, then this is the best we’re going to get for now.

												Game has only 3 seasons per Career, have fun with that... I prefer something with a bit more... well time... before the game ends. thought it was a bug at first but after 3 careers in 5 days I figured it could not be, this game would be worth the money if it lasted longer, but not like this!(Edit: Apparantly it IS a bug, you can get lucky and continue if you saved before the season ended (golden cup on last date) and try going to the new year over and over...)Furthermore there are so many game breaking bugs, 1: cars that run off track and jump in a lap ahead of you,2: pit stops that is taken by driver 1 but the fuel and tire change is done to driver 2 who is now parked out on the track while the driver supposed to go into pit is parked in the pit untill you manualle enter his pit stop window and fix his stop aswell3: the ingame music is 1 melody running in circles, after playing just 20 hours I got so sick of it I disabled music, that resulted in a timid click... click... click sound...4: way to basic in some areas as UI (user interface) and well thought out in others... example:::5: sometimes the AI pits and get a lap of 00:00:051 to 00:00:058 and is a lap ahead with full tank and new tires!When building or dismantling the car you can put on a full aero-package and engine parts in 4 clicks : clever...But what is not so clever is : when repairing you have to put each indiviual part into a list for your mechanics to work with not a ""que all damaged parts button"" and if you further more want to pay for the fix to be instant... you again have to repair each car part one by one... no ""fix entire repair list button""... and everywhere you have to CLICK pop up windows shut, soo many games have automatically enter as yes and esc as no / cancel. but not here, you must click items and then click ok. and games that force you to do that often auto move your mouse to the ok button, not here, and it is offcourse oddly off center to where your mouse isanother sad thing is when you drive the driverlist with the current positions is not long enough.For some stupid reason they decided that they allow anything from 10cars to 42 cars in the league, but the list is only 16 cars long and half as long as the actual screen where the track isthey could have made it at least double as long so you did not have to scroll up and down the list all the time.This is the most half donkeyed shoddy game I ever payed 20€ for...

												This game is JUNK! Do not under any circumstance buy it. There is no tutorial at all, so you are left ramdomly clicking buttons in the hope you will accomplish some thing useful. Steam says I have been playing this game for 20 hours... the vast majority of those hours have been with the game minimised and me  searching the forums in a browser for a clue as to how to continue with the game. When you spend more time looking up how to play the game than actually playing the game, this wears thin very quickly. This is a lazy excuse for a game that should have been shipped on cassette, free on a magazine, 20 years ago! The only boundry this pushes is how much you can charge for this rubbish. Shame on you STEAM for even selling this after all the feedback you are getting about people wanting their money back and ""stop selling this now!""			"

Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. And oh dear again. As many times as you like.I had such high hopes for this. It has an interface which reminds me of On The Ball: World Cup Edition, which I've been happily playing since 1994. Sit in your own office, hang out in the drivers' canteen, loiter in the grounds of HQ...yes!But, no. It might well have a drivers' canteen, but that doesn't count for anything when the gameplay is so confusing and inconsistent, and nothing you do seems to really have much of an effect on anything.It FEELS like it should be really good, and that's what is so utterly frustrating about it. I had no idea what I was doing. I'm sure the developers understood their game perfectly when they were developing it, but I wasn't there, so that's no use to me at all. Races are baffling, it's bugged as hell, and you'll soon get bored.If someone involved in OTB was involved in this, it's got the potential to be brilliant one day. Now is not that day. "

												Well looking at the feedback and reviews this game has had which is mostly negative, I thought I would give it the benefit of the doubt and try it, £3.50 I'm not going to cry over but this game is so unfinished with so many bugs, it appears the common bug looking around the WWW is you can't go on to a second season and the only way to fix this is to re-install the game and hope it forwards on to the next season and if it doesn't well wash, rinse and repeat.Other downside is, the lack of relistic calculations, if you set everything to grip and high downforce you are going to win all the time, even on fast tracks like Monza should be low down force and high speed but when I did that, the lap times were 20seconds of the pace, I wacked them to max down force and low top speed and ended up being around 10 seconds quicker than the next team, go figure!!!I'm not sure I'm holding out much hope on the 2015 if there is one due...

												This game is pretty terrible. Automatic pit stops don't work and therefore drivers are constantly running out of gas, no amount of tweaking gets cars even with 5 star drivers running anywhere near qualifying lap times, and animations of the race's progress constantly pause the game time and take control away from you until they finish or are skipped. The big problem with these cutscenes during races is that by the time you've moved to cancel it, it's already over, and by the time you go back to what you were trying to do, there's another one. Hilariously, they never end if you try putting time acceleration up to full.I really should have known I was in for a bad time when I saw that the title screen's background was a 16:9 pic squashed into a 4:3 letterbox... With black borders on my 16:9 screen. The interface is a mess, the graphics are terrible, the sound effects almost nonexistent, and while everything appears on the surface to be deep and customizable, really there's no point to the sliders. Completely unplayable garbage. Good thing I got it at 66% off.			"

												I've been a F1 fan for many years and thought this could be pretty fun game judging from the screenshots and videos. One of the biggest mistakes I've ever made concerning my video gaming history. It hardly consists any tutorial and you pretty much have to find everything by yourself.There are unforgivable bugs (for me at least) such as: After the first race it automatically simulates to next race and nothing happens between the days and when you get to next race the first one didn't even happen. When it simulates it says something like ""Please wait, game has to calculate"" which is the best part of the game because then you can do something else with your life for a good few minutes.Although the game is clearly something made by the devil himself I have to say that if there'll ever be (there has to, right?) patches it could turn average.Waiting for that...

												I really wanted to like this as I loved the old Grand Prix Manager games. Unfortunately the interface is really poor and a it's a headache to even interact with the game, much less derive any enjoyment from playing it. I don't mind the hilarious licence dodging team and driver names ('Sebastian Bettel', 'Black Horse Racing' etc.), I don't mind the relatively simplistic graphics, but an interface that bad is impossible to ignore. Hopefully one day someone will make a good Formula One management game, I would have thought there's a lot of potential players out there. This is not that game though. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.			"

												Recently bought this against all the negative reviews and i have to say thumbs up to the dev, Well done, great game.    I've been playing ""Racing Manager 2014"" for almost 2 F1 seasons and have had no problems with it at all. No crashes & I haven't found any bugs yet. UI is great very simple and easy to use + you have a tutorial that tells you about all the functions and what they do.Gameplay - You are a manger so you mainly watch and make adjustments so that your team does well.Graphics off the track look just like the screenshots, Graphics of watching the race were average for a 2014 game and would now have to be rated as below average.Qaulity of game vs Price . I have to say that the price is a slightly high for the qaulity. I would say that this game is worth about $15. That said if the product goes on sale i would buy it again.If the game supported Multiplayer or/and Mods then i would say it is but its not.Takeaway, the graphics let the game down because they are old & there is only so much you can do until this game becomes repetative.Overall Score - 7 out of 10 - Thank god there's no bugs.

												Very potential game with poor execution. The game has several bugs and all in all doesnt really have any improvements compared to gpm 2. No multiplayer option. Drivers dont give you feedback on carsetup and it seems that one setup will suffice for all the tracks. Not to mention that thus far ive had several races where no one recieves points. There are also races where your drives suddenly just loose positions even once they have crossed the finish line (and this happens often as well). This far ive gone through 11 races of which none have rewarded any points for any team. The only improvement over gpm series i can think of is the R&D.			"

It just seems to be totally at random of anything works or not, and is a great way to waste time. As a racing and F1 fan I thought I might enjoy managing a team, but the game just found ways to make it boring, and the drivers constantly complain at you during qualifying.

												DO NOT BUY! THIS GAME DOES NOT WORK!I was hoping for a GP game similar to Football Manager and one half of the game does deliver. After forming a team you can research and manufacter parts to build your car, obtain funds through getting sponsers and building up your fan base, train up your drivers and other staff such as mechanics, designers, etc. This part of the game works fairly well and I enjoyed. Then comes the second part of the game, the actual race weekend...         This was absymal. Firstly the manual is the most useless thing I've encountered since the present government. The tutorial ditto. The game would benefit from an assistant manager/advisor to give you some guidence on race set up, tyre wear etc, instead you have to work everything out for yourself and not much seems to make a lot of difference.          The best set up seems to be high grip/high acceleration regardless of the circuit. As drivers I chose the Lewis Hamilton character and a complete novice to train up from stratch but there was little difference in their performance. In my first race I ran out of fuel so set up a new game allowing refuelling. Great except now my pit crew kept giving me a massive tank of fuel during qualifying making me very slow and I couldn't seem to change this. Massively buggy too. My time was too slow to get through Qually 1 and yet some how I did. At the end of the race the positions awarded to me were different to where I'd finished! Pit stops were random and the race experience tedious. I ended up putting it on high speed and going off to make a cup of tea.            Finallly with a sense of relief I was through the utterly awful experience of the race weekend and back into the team management phase, the part of the game which I enjoyed and seemed to work. Except I wasn't. I'd skipped 2 weeks to the next race weekend (groan. can I face another?), however none of my research, manufacturing, building creation etc had moved on.Basically I've discovered I've wasted money on a game that doesn't work. Can I get a refund? Because selling something that doesn't work is a scam and I would think illegal, unless the developers offer a full refund.			"

												Picked this up on Sale. Only needed half an hour to discover it's simply a slightly polished version of Pole Position 2012.Props to Kalypso for identifying a passionate potential market that has been criminally neglected for over a decade, but this is not what fans of the genre want.The drivers look comical, the graphics are apalling and an attractive livery is impossible thanks to a strange colour pallette, unattractive sponsor designs and a total lack of customization. The sponsor system is over-simplified, as are contract negotiations.Plus points are the attentiont o detail in some areas. The assignment of race engineers to drivers was a nice touch but does not factor in their working relationship which is a shame. The tech tree system is an ok solution for a development process that is hard to quantify fairly and realsitically in a game.The pit crew system is interesting and I like the spirit of some of the features they've tried to implement. Despite being a constructor, you can - and often should - assemble a car entirely from customer components until you get things off the ground which didn't work for HRT and shouldn't work for you so points off there. The game gives poor feedback and frankly, I believe setup should be something that the engineer and driver should have direct input in and control over rather than you as a manager constantly tweaking little sliders and trying to extrapolate useful data.A strange blend of being too nerdy in areas where it should simplify, and over simplifying the areas that should have more depth compiles the above issues to ensure that I really cannot recommend anyone, no matter how desperate, pick up this game.Kalypso, as a genre this one is arguably easier to cater to than most. there are plenty of examples of what we want to see in games that are almost 20 years old. Please, I beg you, go an dplay these games and find out what made them so well loved and then simply bring them up to date.			"

												So what to say about this game... First things first. Do not buy it. Use your money on something else! Seriously! Set them on fire! Give them to Bill Gates or a homeless person (much wiser). It is guaranteed to make you have a better time than this game.It does fail in every single aspect of a management game. It doesn't even look like the game are looking at the same place in coding to look for team name, when you are on different screens. It's just extremely weird.Whatever team you start with, whatever strength, whatever you do. You will not have - and I repeat, you will NOT have a car, engine or any employees except a pit-crew and two drivers (if two or more driver was assigned to the team before you started the game).The problem with this, is that the game doesn't give you enough time to actually research, design and manufacture these parts before Race 1, so you have to buy some poor parts, and a generic engine to get going!Oh, it's just research and manufacture. It's no design process in the game.This means, you can start with Ferrari, and only have 14 guys as a pit-crew and 2 drivers. That is it. It's beyond ridiculous.It is no real names in the game, but it comes with an editor, so you can change names to real names. Problem is, some are duplicated.Oh, and trying to look at the drivers history to figure out the name, might be good. Just be aware that the game have a random statistic on many drivers. It's just taken at random from different points of 2012 AND 2013!For more info:

Has the interest level of studying the slug.Will end up with you stamping on the slug.Don't let the short amount of time I have logged on this game fool you. The reasons are:1) I spent at least another hour with a frozen screen when the game terminally crashed. This was the only crash I saw whole game.2) I spent countless amounts of time clicking sliders and I'm not sure why.3) I spent a long time clicking through various menus to find I needed to click back to another menu.4) Of all the time logged, approximately 20 seconds of it was practice, qualifying and race. Which showed me video after video of cars that I couldn't identify or care about. Just driving around. Not crashing or overtaking. Just moving slightly.Conclusion:Fiddly menusVery unintuitiveMind numbingly slow and dullShould be called slug racing manager.  "

												I've now played this game on and off for nearly 2 days, on and off because that was the only way I could safeguard my PC from being thrown out of the window. After having worked in the Formula 1 industry as an engineer, and having been a fan since James Hunt was fighting Nikki Lauda, I will say that this is probably the biggest load of tosh since, well, I can't think when. The qualifying is Q1, 2, and 3, however there seems to be about 40 drivers. The controls are totally unintelligible, the manual may as well be printed out and hung in the lavatory, as it will be more use there. I have spent my time just desperately trying to figure out what things do, and still can't. My recommendation? Stay as far away from this as you would from a rattlesnake carrying a machete. Unfortunately, I have actually paid hard earned money for this, and spent time which I will never get back.If you like this genre, or indeed this sport, do yourself a favour and grab a copy of ""Grand Prix Manager 2"". It's available as a free download on the internet, just do a google search. It's probably the best game of this genre that there has ever been.			"

I run a pretty high end system, and this game just is so slow.  The tutorial is crap, I'm sure for the person who has tons of time to commit to learning the game, it could be fun.  Once you get a couple of hours into the game things make a little more sense, but even still, it took me a few days to really get into the details of the game and understand how it all works.  Unfortunately the amount of time it takes this game to load, and the interface that the user is supposed to be able to use just ruins the potential for fun.  I tried to keep playing the game to give it a chance but it doesn't get any better.			"

Random button clicking is the only way to go.The graphics are so outdated if it hadnt cost me money it would be funny. For proof look at the image of Lewis Hamilton (or Levi Hampshire as he is possibly called), my 6 yr old son could do better with an etch-a-sketch.The in game music and sound effects seems to have been ripped off from an atari gameand thats just the basics, when you look at the game itself...There is no way of working out how to setup the car for each race. The drivers don't guide you, nobody tells you what settings need changing so it comes down to guesswork.I did some pre season testing but have no idea how it was benefitting me, and had no feedback from anywhere.The in-race / qualifying / testing screen is cluttered confusing and useless, on top of which as you watch the racing unfold you are inundated with cut-scenes of cars driving round the same 2 corners, not highlights of the race just someone driving round a bend.I think grand prix manager 2 from the 90's was a far superior game in terms of gameplay, layout, graphics, sound, and every other conceivable aspect of the game.How do I get my money back?

And though at first it seems you are given quite a lot of control over the setup of the car, it turns out after a short while, that all you really can do is set everything to max grip and max acceleration - any deviation from this and you lose crazy amounts of time, no matter the track. It's just dumb. Also can't seem to get past race weekend #1 - gets stuck on something and I can't play on.Spend your money elsewhere.			"

I would have thought after so many times trying to release this title they would have got it right by now. But... alas....no.... just listen to what the people say, get it right, and release it and stop taking our hard earned money			"

												This game isn't terrible, but it's pretty bad. There are no indications as what you are supposed to do, so be ready to alt+tab a lot to look at some online tutorials. That said, once you start to know how to play the game, it's fairly simple. If you want to race, all you have to do is tell the drivers to make sure they finish no matter what, and call in for pit stops any time the tires look like they are gonna blow out. It gets simple and very easy FAST, so I lost interest quickly.tldr - At first you have no clue what you're doing, then it becomes a slow clicker.			"

Only slight criticisms are the lack of a tutorial (took me a while to work out what i needed to do to get my car into a race) and the fact that it constantly seems to keep crashing/not responding after every race. Other than that there is LOADS of nice features to the game like being able to make your own team and drivers. All the 2013/2014 F1 teams are there but with slightly different names and the drivers also have slightly differnt names but you can edit them back to the real names. Worth the £5 i paid.			"

If you are a bit more competitive, stay away from this game. "

												By the time you read this, it is likely too late. Like me, you might have been interested in the game an impulse bought based on an awesome steam sale.Sorry, but this game isnt worth much. The ""tutorial"" doesnt help you play the game, it just explains which each area is for. When trying to learn the game, it is impossible to actually adjust anything or really follow the game because it insists on showing clips of the races which pauses any monitoring and adjestments you need to do.I paid $4 for the game (at 80% off!), and I am so greatly disappointed I wish there was a way to demand a refund on the lousy game.

												I can't recommend this game.  As of now I still can't figure it out.  For  the record I am an R&D engineer in real life.  I love sim games.  I dont care if the mechanics are clunky and the graphics are bad.  I was hoping this game would give me the fix i need since Gran Turismo 6 dropped the B-spec racing.  I love grabbing a cup of coffee sitting down and watching my cars race.  After about 3 hours with this game I managed to get my cars put together but when I try to to do practice runs it says I have 1 or more driver slots open.  I hired a few more drivers and went through every menu I could click on and still cant figure it out.  The bad menu layouts lack of meaningfull starter info and sloppy presentation would leave anyone standing there scratching thier head and randomly clicking icons.  I wonder if they beta tested this game at all. If they did i would bet they did it in house with people who were already too familiar with the code.  Next time before releasing a game if you really cant't afford good outsourced beta testing put out a simple craigslist ad offering to pay teenagers to play a new game.  Or hell just bring it home and let a family member or friend try it.  Or even just follow the lazy trend of big dev's and release it in ""beta"" let people pay you to beta test your stuff and you can blame the whole crappy mess on it ""still being in beta and requiring community feedback"".

												Reasons. The game lacks loads of information. There is no driver feedback. Car telemetry lacks. I also found it hard to try and find where my car setup is having a effect on the performance of the track as there is no real proper sector breakdown to look at. I do not recommend this game at all.			"

												Great Idea for a Game BUT this company should NEVER be allowed near PC games every again. They tried with Pole Position which was bugs bugs more bugs and crash after crash then locking up. Racing Manager 2014 has the same issues but with less of what happened in the first game. Don't try changing equipment too quickly as the game will lock up, i suggest saving every week or after every race otherwise when is crashes it is back to the start you go. Great idea for a game like i said however that does not give anybody the right to release a game that has SO MANY issues.			"

												Good. This is a good start at a racing management game but the devs haven't made an effort since 2012 really. Check out Motorsport Manager. Much better game. There are way too many bugs with this game so I don't think that it was tested well. Seems rushed.			"

												Worst game in my library, and that's sayong a lot. I spent hours and testing different setups of my car, but whatever the conditions, the same setup was always fastest. Terribly unbalance game. What a waste!			"

												Game is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The cutscenes interrupt any simulation and ability to click anything, and when you ultimately get to the end of the season, the game breaks and you're stuck for all eternity in 2013.Probably the worst game I've ever bought.			"
