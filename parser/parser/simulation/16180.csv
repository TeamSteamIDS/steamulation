												Fun game. But you have to keep your eye on your villagers, the game runs even if you exit out of it. I've always come back the next day and find that they have all died. x-x			"

												Fun waste of a few hours. Easy to run in the background when you're doing homework or housework or something else, and come back to check on sometimes. Doesn't have much repeatability, but alright.			"

												These games can get a little addicting, but you definitely need a lot of tips online to continue it in some parts, most things are well hidden and are confusing at best so I found I needed quite a bit of help. Good game but not my favorite in the genre.			"

												I love the series of Virtual Villagers, I do so hope they get number 4, 5 and 6 on Steam too soon! <3This one is, like the others, a real time game with some simulation and strategy over, and it can be challenging, but not so much that you can't relax at the same time. ^_^			"

												Play on Slow, check back 24hrs or so and you got yourself a pretty entertaining casual game.play on Fast, check back often like every 2hrs or just watch the game while you do other stuff it gets pretty challenging.the difficuly changes it up a bit, but i would recommend easy for all.I had this game when it came out and easily lost whole days playing it, not to mention watching my villagers grow up and get old(and die) and watching the village grow from 7 to like 50 you villagers you gain a sense of tiumph10/10 would recommend mostly for Casuals, Hardcore gamers might like it.

												Between slow repop of food and 'event's that deplete food stores there is constant food shortages early game. The concept is nice and amusing but the game just isn't engaging enough and has little long term play.			"

												Everyone dies too quickly and I find its difficult to really progress without following a very specific formula. Takes micro managing to the extreme, as food sources can completely vanish and leave you with an elder and two children to run the entire village. I remember it being more fun as a child, but possibly because it was only played in five minute increments. The fact that it can't be paused and runs even while closed is another bad point. Leave the game alone for a day, and you come back to a dead village.			"

												Even better than the second Virtual Villagers! The graphics are improved, and some of the game mechanics have been fixed, as well! Otherwise than that, it's pretty much the same as the first two. Build a village, keep them alive, and solve puzzles! It's simple and fun, great for people who don't want much of a time commitment, or lack a powerful computer to run complicated games. I played this game as a kid and still like it 15 years later.
