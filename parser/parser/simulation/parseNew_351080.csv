												Some crashes and bugs. Really no excuse for a game that's been around this long - I would expect this from sandbox / pre-release. Got it for $5 - totally worth it.			"

												Fun game. If you like Game Dev Tycoon, you will probably like this too.  Unfortunately, it freezes up often which is annoying. If you can deal with that, you will have a good time playing.			"

												Love this game.  I have the crashes that everyone else describes but if you reopen game and press continue, it restarts where you left off.  Its like the crash is associated with an autosave.			"

												The Corporate Machine is actually very interesting and well-done. Although the graphics are a little outdated, this game is great. Especially in 2001, if you were making a strategy game, it HAD to be based off war. But this one is like Risk, and still, instead of using your armies to conquer the world, you use competitvley low prices and monopolies to do so. One problem I have with the game is that there is no real in-game tutorial, like modt other PC games of the time. However, there is a manual online.			"

												I think the mechanics arent working to be honest. So I decided to build the company store then upgrade it to the company mall where it promises that I will be able to cut costs of my employees by 15% each level. However, when I proceed to do it. nothing happens. My costs still remains the same. manufacturing costs and the rest are the same. is this game broken? And when i'm playing in the normal mode it seems that even if I had the 'researcher' specialised field, i'm always being overtaken. Even though many years has passed, bugs are prominent in this game causing it to crash. When I research things as well ie.jet engine. my aircraft still looks the same as what I start off with - a propeller driven plane, not like the picture above. what a dissapointment.			"

												As a business simulator, it does very very well educationally. As a video game, its mediocre at best with so many demographics and color schemes that you'll more than likely will need glasses or go blind when you're done playing it. It has its moments where I have fun with the silly names and overall domination factor when you completely make your product a standard on just one continent let alone the whole world.I bought this on sale @ 3.29 USD and worth its price. 9.99 USD is a bit much for the type of game you're getting. At 2001, its a good price for its time. But its well over 14+ years. I would say purchase this once it hits 4.99. Either way, its a solid game.			"

												The first thing I need to say is READ THE MANUAL! If you're like me and tend to play a casual game or two to get the hang of things it's very easy to have no idea what you are doing and lose the game. A quick skiim of the manual will give you an idea of what is what and how the game runs.I very nearly wrote a bad review after my first game after giving up in just five minutes, I hadn't read the manual and had no clue what I was doing.The graphics and sound options on the game are not great, basic graphics and no volume control are something of a turn-off, but you can do what I did and turn off the game's music and ignore the graphiocs quality.Style of play.... According to the game there are three ways of playing; production, marketing and research. Nope. You either do all three or you'll have a hard time playing. All you really get top decide is which area you have that edge.Production is the number one priority since lack of products means lack of sales, and with no sales toy have no income to improve the business.Marketing and Research are roughly equal, the first gives you unstated bonuses in sales as it makes the product more attractive whilst the second can improve the performance/features/whatever of the product or make it cheaper and faster to produce the product, improving your profit margin.I could go on but I'm not good at writing reviews so I'll finish with some ratings.Playability 6/10 The game isn't particularly engrossing but is good for quick games (1-2hrs)Functionality 5/10 The game runs easily but I have dealt with random crashes several times (Regular saving helps)Graphics 3/10 Not great quality and most of the buttons aren't labelled so you have to work those things out.Sound 2/10 Volume control is either Loud or Off but the quality isn't bad.Overall score 4.5/10I'm going to give the game a positive recommendation since it's one of those games where if you're looking for somethign quick to play it delivers the goods. It just suffers on quality.			"

												Just like the old days - except the game randomly freezes, you can hear the music, click/build stuff, but nothing gets done and time doesn't lapse.  Only fix is to save/reboot.  Great on the nostalgia factor, not much else.			"

												I used to love this game when i had it as a demo as a kid, but i really regret buying it now. The game randomly stops working after a period ingame so you play russian roulette with crashes to even be able to play it the game is a solid 7/10 the delivery though is a 2/10 definitly not worth the money in its current format			"

												Relic from the past.While some games are kind of ageless (minus the graphics), others don't age that good. Resolution and UI are too awkward for nowadays.Maybe a remastered version could work, but I can't recommend it as it is.			"

												Классная стратежка, как раз для тех кому такой добротный учебник по экономике как дилогия Индустриальный Гигант сложноват показался. Игра очень хлёстко высмеивает все законы рынка, гарантируя победу тому кто дешевизну рабочей силы ставит вперёд квалификации труда, успевая при этом задирать цены, эксплуатировать детский труд, эксплуатировать иммигрантов, снижать зарплаты, вышвыривать работяг на мороз, экономить на утилизации отходов вываливая их в пересыхающую реку, спаивать офисный планктон, нанимать бандитов, подкупать чиновников, пилить бюджет, устраивать войны...Игра изначально рассчитана на моддинг (вплоть до добавления своих планет, ололо), так как в ней по дефолту предусмотрены лишь 3 категории товаров - и к каждой нужен индивидуальный подход, и чем выше сложность, тем больше отличий в виду всё большей приближённости стёба к жизни. К примеру, вынос производства поближе к рабам грозит в первую очередь яблоМакам, а в случае с автомобилями уже на среднем уровне сложности покупатель в ценит в первую очередь безопасность (это значит что минимальный уровень сложности это когда вся планета сплошная Россия, и на чужих жизнях можно нехило экономить).Игра также подчёркивает что завод это центр вселенной. Моллы и ТЦ нужны только для того чтобы работяги с завода могли там зарплату просеять, индустрия развлечений нужна чтобы работяги кувалдами офисы не громили, маркетинг и мерчендайзинг бесполезны без надбавочного продукта, тренинги по продажам фигня, повышение квалификации работяге нужно в первую очередь...В виду того что Industrial Giant III нам и не светит, Stardock смело может выпускать сиквел, с катсценами, климатическими условиями, политическими условиями, отсутствием рандома при генерации Земли, ну и так далее.

												You know Risk.... One of those ancient relics called a ""board game"".  Well meet the basic version of that same board game... with no armies.  Just a single product.  That you sell.  Realistically, this isn't even a reflection of a real world producting team and I'm sure in its day it was great. But I never played it until it came onto steam yesturda, and I can say this game has had its day.			"

												I loved this game when it came out, and was very glad to see it re released on steam.  You play the CEO of a tech startup company and  by managing production, research, marketing, and sales you play for control of the global computer market.  It feels a little bit like Risk when you are playing it.I have played this game hundreds of times, and there are many different ways to win.  Each time you play it different as the traits of the territories change on each map randomly.			"

												16 year old game that still works flawlessly on new PC systems.  There's a small learning curve once you start a new game but as soon as you figure it out the game quickly becomes quite addicting and you'll likely find yourself sitting for hours trying to grow your operations to take over the world.  10/10			"
