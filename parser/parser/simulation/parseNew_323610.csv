												Oldie but Goldie, having the most channel on YouTube still featuring EM4/ 911 FR as a regular feature and being a Beta tester for numerous Modification you could argue I am Biased. And you might be right, i got the game on it's day when it was originally released on April 6 2006. Since then I propably put well beyond 3000 hours into this game.And what I said back then is all the more true nowadays with all the mods that you can get. There is no game like EM4/911 FRMaybe one day we will say the same about Emergency 5, but that day is far away yet, until that day arrives all hail the King of Emergecny RTS games, Emergency 4/911 First Responders There are only two things that I could say that are negative,- the graphics enigine is starting to show it's age- the learning curve is steep and can be overwhelming for some by the sheer number of calls in a day.

												From my personal EMT and CERT expirence:If you want an Emergency Responder game, this is the one. There is no other game that has the amount of detail and freedom as this game. You control the fire, medical, police, and technical services of a city. Firefighters must set up hoses and put equipment on. Police must secure crime scenes and control onlookers. Medics must triage and transport. Technical services must repair equipment. The game does a great job of making sure to put enough emphsis on each of the services. I can not recomend this game enough.As added fun, I recomend looking into the LA Mod made by Hoopah. It changes the game from European to American services.			"

												Got LA mod and played co-op.Did a few disasters well.Got called out to a riot - 'aight, I'll send a patrol car.Cops brutally murdered by a good 20 people.Send out the SWAT team.SWAT shoot back 10 rioters, but they keep coming, and get brutally murdered by 30 ganging up on each one. Every new civilian who walks in somehow being recruited to the cause and fighting armed soldiers.Send out 2 SWAT vans and a truckful of national guard.SWAT and National Guard fight well, killing about 30, but lack of organisation and attempt to avoid brutal murder means they're all eventually murdered by the onslaught.Send out Blackhawk helicopter and army humvees loaded with marksmen.Marksmen take position and shoot without regard, killing over hundreds.Approximately 10 police cars called, to maintain order and restrain civilians from walking on the scene, they are overtaken - all murdered. The civilians keep coming. Shots keep firing. The bodies pile up. Nobody shall take down the marksmen.Send in mass casualty unit, stretchers flee charging civilians, the national guard marksmen covering their asses by shooting down any pursuers. Mass casualty unit ends with more casualties than they brought back.Eventually enough cops arrive, blocking every nook and cranny of every crook and nanny that could ever arrive. Still shooting down stragglers who get through or ignore the police.20 cop vans and SUVs, 4 SWAT vans, 3 national guard trucks and Humvee, a US Army Blackhawk helicopter, FBI trucks, sheriff deputies, 2 mass casualties units, 3 coroner vans and one firetruck later, I've got over a hundred bodies waiting in the street, rotting, hearing their dying screams over and over I can't tell what is living and what is dead, they are all just the emergency. I do not have the money, I do not have the time, and I lack the mind, to clear this up, to move so many bodies.We stick a bunch of police barricades and traffic cones around the entire block and everyone gathers outside, never relenting. We had to leave the carnage in the road, there was no choice. All witnesses were arrested or killed. Nobody shall know of this national tragedy. Save for the brave emergency staff who will have it burned into their very souls.Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥10/10.I'm serious by the way, check my screenshots.			"

												This is a great game, albeit with a few significant problems.The Gameplay is the best part of it, where you have to simultaneously deploy and manage multiple response units including firemen/firetrucks, Ambulances/Paramedics, Police, Negotiators, Salvage vehicles etc. You start in a suburban area where you respond to numerous events. The game quickly manages to scale up and has you managing multiple units at the same time, in different areas of the city, all earning you money to purchase new equipment. When you have the required equipment it unlocks a ""mission"" that takes you into a separate ""mission map"" and you get a more complex mission. When you complete the mission it takes you back to the suburban area again, to manage more random events until you have purchased the required hardware for the next mission.This gameplay is quite fun, and even though it is the same incidents, the map is quite large and always has you thinking on ""where is the nearest hydrant?"", ""what resources do i need for that?"" or ""where is that criminal running?"" so each incident is still quite unique.Now, the ""significant problems"" I mentioned earlier (from least significant to most significant)Firstly: Audio is ok. It repeats a lot of things a lot of times and has some interesting things (like every vehicle you click on sounds the ""ambulance sirens"", even if you click on a car on the side of the road)Secondly: Graphics are ok. It doesn't have any options above 1024x1280 and on a full HD display it is somewhat grainy, but I don't think this significantly detracts from the game Thirdly: When doing the more complex ""Mission scenario"" I still haven't found a way to restart it without quitting to windows. So when you make a big stuff-up and all your firemen are dying with a wall of fire between them and the paramedics, you actually have to deal with the situation... or you quit to desktop and start the game againNext: Each individual will not really do anything unless you have told them to. ie: A fireman will watch a fire burn, unless you have told him to equip an extinguishing device (hose or extinguisher) and is within range. If a fire moves out of range, he won't follow it. Same goes for Paramedics and Police. I'd love to see a little bit of automation, such as: tell the fire-truck to ""CONTAIN"" the fire and they setup automatically to stop the fire spreading, or tell the paramedics to ""TREAT"" the casualty, and when he is ready for transport they should automatically load him into the ambulance and take him away.Oh, and firement shouldn't stand in one fire when trying to fight another fire... yeah this can happen.Lastly: Traffic routing. If you order ten ambulances (yes, i made a few mistakes fighting a fire once) and tell them where to go, after the first two arrive, then the others keep driving around in circles because they can't get to the spot where the first two ambulances parked. Sometimes they'll drive around a building on fire and blow up because they are trying to get to that exact spot.And sometimes they get ""jammed"" because they drove too close to a pedestrian and then you have to manually ""unjam"" them so they can drive again. (not too common)But, all in all, a good, enjoyable game, just be warned that some things are frustrating "

												Time Disclaimer -- I have played 911: First Responders / Emergency 4 for hundreds of hours prior to the Steam release.Emergency 4 is a Real Time Strategy in which the user is tasked with controlling a number of German Emergency Services; Police, Ambulance, Fire, and Mechanics. Using these, it's up to the user to deal with a number of disasters in the main campaign ranging from simple fires to earthquakes, hostage situations, airline disasters and more! Alternatively, the user can play an endless mode in which they must deal with random emergencies which will grant them the finances to purchase more vehicles and deal with bigger disasters. One great aspect is you're not penalized for doing a bad job so if you get bored, you can use your police units to cause havoc. The game is easy to get into but difficult to master as controlling a number of different emergency units can quickly become overwhelming. The assets have also aged well since release. Emergency 4 is definitely a unique game and is an often looked over gem, it's a game that is both engaging and enjoyable, even if you're not a fan of Real Time Strategies. Additionally, the game is VERY moddable. The 'LA Mod[losangelesmod.com]' is definitely recommended as it adds dozens of additional units and missions. To put it simply, this game is a must play and for the price it's being offered at, it's definitely worth grabbing. There are rumors of emegency 5 being released next month (October 2014) and hopefully it's a better game than the poorly done Emergency 2012/2013/2014 games and hopefully, the release of Emergency 4 on Steam is a good sign of Emergency 5 being released on Steam sometime soon.

												At first glance, this game might look like those abysmal simulator games that you find decorating the local GameStop's bargain bin and the Steam Greenlight page in equal measure. However, 911: First Responders couldn't be more different. What appears to be a mild-mannered and simple simulation is a surprisingly realistic and hair-pullingly tough game of skill and judgement that plays out more like an RTS than a traditional sim. Well-researched subject material, a lengthy and challenging campaign, and exquisite sound and music design go hand-in-hand to create this gem of a game that deserves far more recognition than first appearances might suggest.In 911: First Responders, the player assumes the role of an emergency dispatcher in an unidentified, accident-prone urban sprawl somewhere in Europe - presumably the Netherlands, considering where developers Sixteen Tons Entertainment hail from. It's your sole duty to command and micro-manage emergency responders of all professions and roles, ranging from police marksmen to fire department marine divers to tow truck technicians. The mammoth campaign is comprised of twenty assignments that are broken up by short sessions of responding to low-level emergency calls inside the city, with each success granting the player some of the funds needed to buy vehicles and upgrades that are imperative for the next big assignment. Though they start out easy enough, these large-scale missions quickly become damningly hard and will push even experienced RTS players to their multi-tasking, micro-managing limits. A very wide range of emergency situations and responses are represented in loving detail, giving the game just enough complexity to be engaging without being overwhelming to people who aren't educated in emergency service operations - despite the plethora of vehicles and personnel on hand, most of the tools the player is given have an obvious and easily comprehensible application. The open-ended nature of each assignment is also something to be noted and applauded - though some missions may have clear solutions, others require creative use of the tools at your disposal in order to save  as many lives as possible.Of course, fun as it is, the game isn't flawless. The eight-year-old graphics can't help but show their age upon close examination (though they aren't 'bad' by any means), and the pathfinding of the game's larger vehicles can become problematic in enclosed areas - which feature heavily in some assignments, occasionally resulting in Tetris-like scenes in which the player must manually guide their confused emergency vehicles out of a tight spot in order to release an urgently-needed automotive at the bottom of the metaphorical heap. The game also has a nasty habit of giving the player new tools or personnel without giving much notification, which wouldn't be so bad if those new tools and personnel didn't tend to play very critical roles in the mission in which you're given them. One notable example is the fifth assignment, in which the player must clean up after a road bridge collapse - a task in which the fire brigade's marine divers are essential for locating sunken cars in the river below. The game, of course, doesn't tell you that it's given you these divers, so they're easy to miss when you're loading up a fire engine to send onto the map.These flaws, however, pale greatly against the immense fun that I've been having with this game so far. The surprisingly steep challenges that it offers seriously surprised me as I progressed further into the campaign, and part of what motivates me to overcome every nail-bitingly tense challenge and assignment is my curiosity over what the next assignment will hold.  At the asking price of £3.99, this game is an absolute steal for its quality and a must for strategy fans and anyone who's enthusiastic about the work of the emergency services. Definitely get this game.			"

												911: First Responders is one of those little gems you pick up in the “dollar bin” not realizing what you’ve found, let it sit on your shelf for a few months, and when you finally get around to playing it you almost feel like you owe it an apology.While this isn’t the best emergency response game I’ve ever played it is one of the most well rounded.  In a 911 title you’d expect to have units from the Police, Fire, and Medical fields but this game goes further.  It also brings in services like clean-up wreckers and specialty vehicles.  In addition, all of your vehicles have their specific roles to play in combating the events that occur in your city.If I had one thing to nitpick about this game it would be that it’s too busy, specifically in the “nonstop” mode.  This mode is almost like a sandbox where you are given event after event to deal with.  The problem here is that occasionally an event is so complicated, like a bush fire, that it takes you a while to deal with it.  While combating that bush fire you may end up getting assigned another fire, or a police action.  This leaves you either losing ground in your complicated task while you deal with the others, or ignoring the others and completing your complicated task.  The limit on how many vehicles you can have active at once also hinders the ability to deal with multiple emergenciesThings get a little better in multiplayer mode, but not much.  Yes, there is a multiplayer mode.  In this mode you and a friend can tackle emergencies in the same city.  The only downside here is that the ability to dispatch new vehicles is turn-based.  Players have to have good communication and use excellent team work in “passing the torch” so their partner can help dispatch vehicles to emergencies without delay.  Once the vehicles are on the map, however, you don’t need control of dispatch in order to maneuver them around.  You do, however, need to return them to headquarters so vehicles are available for other emergencies.Graphically this game is pretty good.  The game plays out in a somewhat 3D map view of the entire city.  You can easily use the mini-map to jump around the city, or scroll off the side with your mouse.  The level of detail is pretty good, as you’ll find yourself needing to access everything from equipment in the vehicles to fire hydrants.  Doors have to be broken down.  Hostages have to be rescued.  Fire victims have to be rescued from buildings.  Injured have to be extricated from vehicles and treated by medics.  It’s a fairly involved game for the graphics being so “zoomed out”.  I never really found myself fighting the camera, it was fairly easy to control and rotate around structures.Sound in the game got somewhat repetitive after a while.  There is one announcement for each type of emergency, and it’s repeated every time the specific emergency happens.  Music is fast paced but also gets a little repetitive at times.  Still, it suits the theme of the game and brings in a little bit of excitement.All in all… I have to refer to my opening statement.  When I got this game I wasn’t expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.			"

												A blast to the past type game. I had all the 911 Emergencies back many moons ago. Setup and control is pretty much to the classic pattern of these type games. They can be pretty fast paced, and a lot of fun.  If you like RTS type games from a top/side down perspective and in the mood for not killing or surviving something somewhere.. these are worth it.

												After two hours, three missions I dare to say it's worth the 5€.Basically it's a real-time strategy where you're not playing a cigar-smoking general who commands armies of tanks, instead your units are medics, firefighters, policemen and other people who have anything to do with emergencies; maybe only Batman is missing.The game has a sandbox-like campaign, where you are assigned as the man directing the city's first line of defense during calamities, and you will get - I presume - randomly generated emergencies including extinguishing fires of various sizes - from a few smoking bushes to blazing multistory buildings, catching pickpockets and restarting failing hearts. Time to time, however, a pregenerated larger scale operation will pop up which will certainly require a combined operation. For example in the first and second one you will need both medics and firefighters - with gasmasks in the second, while you need medics, criminal profilers and marksmen in the third. All in all, I have no problems with the variety of missions so far.But the game has problems. The most important - for me - is that it lacks active pause; when you stop the time, you cannot issue orders. Many would say ""it's called real-time for a reason"", but I would answer: ""If it was real-time strategy then an ambulance would reach its destination in 30 minutes or so, and not within seconds. So let's call these accelerated time strategy, and as such, they need active pause. Especially when you have to act for all your men and women, because they will apathetically suffocate in a smoke-filled building should you not order them outside."" And with that last sentence we reached the topic of AI.Well, it's simple, and not without problems. For example the firemen will target the nearest fire within a few a meters when they have a hose in their hands, but will gladly try to take the longer route to reach their assigned target, even if that way the hose will be too short. So don't try to send them on longer journeys unattended, which means a lot of micromanagement when your hands would be full even with a more proactive crew.Another problem is that they just don't seem to comprehend the gravity of these emergencies. For example, in the third mission I had six marksmen ordered to riddle two mobsters with bullets. The culprits were of course running towards the edge of the map, and my unit of cold professionals, the tip of the spear, the edge of the knife, the crack of my ... eh... were walking after them. And I don't mean they did not take a vehicle or something, I mean that they simply did not feel like running. I had to order a donut-eating patrolman into the criminals path, and - luckily - they immediately opened fire on him, giving enough time to my SWAT team to finish sightseeing and catch up with them. My condolences to the widow, her husband died a heroic, although otherwise completely avoidable death. Bleh.I think that's all I could say about the game. The sounds are okay and the graphics are, well, there. I mean you won't drop your chin, unless the most recent game you played is Defender of the Crown, but it's not bad at all. Long story short, as I mentioned before the game has its own share of sometimes hair-thinning problems, and I would hesitate to call it a good buy should I have paid 20€ or so for it, but for 5€ it's a bargain.

												I just noticed this game appeared on Steam, But I have been playing it since release.  An absolutely fantastic game, if you look past the very poor coding and AI spawning ETC.  Has an amazing mod community and some of the best content such as the LA mod completely transforms the game.  One of the only Emergency services management game and highly recommended.  As for the flaws, yes there are many.  The civilians have no regard for their own safety and routinely stand close to cars about to explode, etc.  When you block a civilians path say closing off the scene of an accident, it will continually spawn civilians until the FPS absolutely tanks.  The AI pathfinding is poor, and even still there are a fair amount of glitches with hoses and other core game mechanics.Regardless, especially playing the LA mod the idea of controlling the different services is absolutely intoxicating.  Even taking the game online to control only one service with your friends makes for some of the best team play.  Graphics are very good considering the games' age.			"

												In comparison to Emergency 5, 911: First Responders is a noticable step down graphically, due to its age, but is actually better in several aspects-AI is way better, Emergency 5's AI is very second rate.There are many Mods for 911, the most well known one is possibly the LA mod.Units can actually enter certain buildings to rescue people, extinguish fires, and SWAT teams can enter buildings during hostage situations to apprehend or neutralize hostiles.Firefighters are more realistic.  When equipped with a hose, you must manually order them to attatch to a hydrant or Water Bower before they can fight fires.Overall, 911 is still very good despite its age, and is, at least until mods start appearing for Emergency 5 and many bugs are fixed, much better.  It also demonstrates what the Emergency series really is. 5/5			"

Some missions fail before your police even get to where you send them. I still love this game and give it 10/10100/100 Five out of five stars "

Greetings!I first need to state that this game was one of my early childhood games so it could be that my review is not entirely unbiased but I will try to keep it as objectively as possible. Emergency 4 or 911: First Responders is - as you will now hopefully know - a real time strategy game in which you take complete control over the fire brigade, the police, the ambulance and technical services. That means that you cannot simply pause, give commands and then let it all work out. Though there is a pause button, you can only move around and do nothing else when it is activated. Before getting into more details, I have to say that buying this game on Steam has the following disadvantage that the Deluxe Edition is not included. Therefore, you will not have a second map to choose from in freeplay and three deluxe missions will not be playable. Furthermore, this is the american version of the game so the cars themselves won't have the original German names on them but rather big, not as fitting English general ones. (That is just a minor detail and I don't think anyone will be bothered that)The CampaignThe Campaign in Emergency 4 consists of 20 missions that follow this vague pattern: There will be a little animation followed by an information text about what has happened and what you will need to do. Then you will try to master the tasks at hand while mostly at some point one or more surprising events occur that make the mission even more difficult. After completing one you will be taken to a freeplay-like map in which you have to take care of random day to day missions in that city until you can buy some special vehicle, equipment or training so you can go on to the next mission. Whilst every mission is fairly manageable, completing all of them with 90-100% (i.e. noone died, personnel and property damage have been mostly avoided, budget and time are okay) is going to be extremely difficult. You will have to do way more stuff on all fronts at once than you can handle but thus the reward was for me even more satisfying when I scored a relatively high percentage. The freeplay When you've decided to play freeplay you are presented with two options: Endless Game and Challenge Mode. On both you will be thrown into a city where random events will occur that you will have to deal with by controlling again all 4 services at hand. The difference between these modes being that on the first, events will be completely random whilst on the second, things will start off relatively easy and will get harder the longer you play. This mode has been for me quite a nice option to waste time on when I am bored or when I want to do something trivial when watching something else but after 40-60 minutes things will mostly get repetitive.Therefore, I highly recommend the usage of mods (which there are plenty of) and as a newcomer I'd start with the easiest to use and the most famous one: The Los Angeles Mod. The GameplayThe Gameplay definitely isn't for everyone. You will need to control every single unit individually, they will not put out fires, treat patients or follow criminals themselves no matter how close they are (except the doctor who will run towards the next injured person when he is out of the vehicle). To give an example of this: There have been reports of a fire nearby and you naturally sent a fire truck. Once you've sent it there, you will need to tell the firemen to get out of the vehicle, then make them equip i.e. a hose, connect it to the truck (or a hydrant) and then tell each of them which fire to put out. To be fair, they are going to put out fires around them once they have connected their hozes but only to a certaint degree. So you can imagine that dealing with everyone individually will be extremely hard and chaotic when you have events everywhere which all need your attention but that is the core of the game. You will be stressed alot, trying to maintain control at all fronts.Overall, if you are searching for a game like this choose Emergency 4. I haven't tested all of the other ones but based on their review rate compared to this one it is fair to say that the 4th part of this series is definitely the best one with a huge modding community so it shall never get bored. Thank you, one person who has read this far!			"

												I played this game for years under the name of emergency 4, I love the game, and  some mods where just asome. Like the los angeles mod or not so populair, wegberg mod. Emergency let you take care of the worst situations. From a road accident to a plain crash in a airport. Fight vs rioloters and terrorist. Emergceny 4 without the mods had some hard points, but the campain was verry fun.I also can recomend other games from the emergency series. Like emergency 3, and the emergency 2012 series (inluding the upgrades 2013 and 2014)I hope to soon play also the next emergency that comes out on 14 november, becouse then is Emergency 5 back. and it has mod support again.

												Being a US player, I've always been extremely turned off with the European style vehicles. Only a matter of opinion of course, but installing the LA Mod (introduces American Reponses Vehicles, with 4-5 other friends, getting together in multiplayer and working to keep the peace, and the city safe is quite challenging. Especially when working with each player who is specializing in one type of Emergency response. I end up spending hours playing this game with friends, as every scenario plays out differently. Though the same map can be a bit bland after many hours of gameplay, taking a small break, then popping back into another match playing a different role greatly changes things up. Definitely a must buy if you have friends to play with.Multiplayer is a bit sketchy at best. If you can’t connect via the traditional server browser,  installing Hamachi or another similar type service works like a charm, providing you and the other player have everything installed the same way (referring to mods). For $5 it is a must buy and provides hours of fun.			"

												This game is old. Like  VERY  old. but it is still a fantastic game. Now upon writing this I haven't played it in a while, but I can tell you that my 123 hours on this game were time  well spent . Apart from the bloody horrendous AI pathfinding, and the long time it takes to load mods (Which are much better than the game - I recommend LA mod), this game is  A MUST BUY  for anyone into strategy and management games. Plus - It is only £3.99, and better than most £39.99 games out there!! "

												Great game, The Controls are pretty simple. I myself, enjoy the game ALOT more with a mod called The ""LA Mod"". Makes the game have US Style Vehicles instead of EU. the Singleplayer map with the ""LA Mod"" is amazing. The game is pretty simple to get into, but can be very hectic in larger dispatches. I Would recommend this game to anyone who likes RTS and/or First Responder simulators.			"

												Awesome game, especially with the LA Mod.It's fun, keeps you on your toes, and is surpisingly complex when you are trying to manage a dozen different crews do things at the same time. It's easily one of the best emergency games I've played to date.There are however, a few things about this game which I do not like. Note that I almost exclusively play the LA mod currently.- In the base game, paramedics are just stretcher bearers (being a paramedic student myself, I find this very annoying), however in the LA Mod, the Paramedics can actually do stuff, whereas the EMTs are mainly stretcher bearers.- The AI drivers can be really stupid, many a traffic jam has been caused when three people tried to go through an intersection at the same time in different directions, and end up having to wait for each other... cue 3 police cruisers to clear the backlog.- A lot of items can be a bit finiky to deploy or use, especially when your trying to do them quickly, an example from the LA mod would be police spikestrips: click car, click to disembark cop, click cop, click get equipment, click spikestrip, wait for cop to get it from car, click location next to road, click deply strip, click in direction to deply.- Trying to manage 10 different crews (eg. 4 fire trucks with 4 firemen each, 3 ambulances with crew, 1 crane and 2 police cars with 2 cops) can be very painful at times, especially when you are racing the clock (either fire spreading or people dieing)			"

												This is a great strategy game...the missions are very enjoyable (with lots of different ways to complete) and there's a lot of variation within the game. Lots of fun hours playing. Minor frustrations with the Save functionality (make sure you save as missions go along or you have to keep restarting right from the begining) Playing in 2016, so obviously graphics aren't top notch, but this remains a very fun and very recommended game.(Playing on Windows 10, Widescreen; no compatibility issues)			"

												This is a great game, lots of great mods, and really entertaining. There are some bugs especially when using mods (you should expect this if you mod games) but mods are really what kept this game alive for so long, the community is still very active making mods, creating clans to play realistically or casually. So for 5 bucks you might as well pick this one up.On a side note to make the game 1920x1080 you need to edit the config files. Also when you get an arson call send cops immediately, when there is an illegal demonstration send more cops than you think you need or you will most likely get cops killed and end up killing lots of civillians as demonstations can get out of hand really quick.

												Personally being a long standing fan of this series I think that Emergency 4 (911: First Responders) is the best game in its series. With modern versions (Emergency 2012, 2014) being nothing but simplified copies with lots of actions and awesome things removed. It surely has many bugs and just generally an old game but it still stands proud to this very day. Especially with mod support that, like with many games, stretches it's lifespan and replayability to new heights. If you like hardcore (sorta :P ) rescue services simulators then it's a definitely a game for you "

												If you like firefighters, first aid and similar things, this game is a must have for you. Costs just 5€ but will entertain you for long time that you may say even 10€ would be worth it.It is an old game with low res graphics. Beware playing it on more active displays or it will minimize to desktop very often (like almost every your order to click).The game itself has a lot of things to do. The first mission, for example. On a rainy day a soil is waterlogged so a crane tilt and fell on a building where were some workers repairing. There are two injuries, one injured person lies under barrier. You need to call the ambulance to heal those injured person, but you also need to call a firefighter to lift the barrier. Then a crane drops even more making a fire and another injury so you will pick a firefighter, extinguish the fire etc. For extinguishing the fire you may equip your firefighter with hose connected to water pipe or to pick fire extinguisher. What to say..there is a lot things to do. Totally worth 5€ even with low resolution graphic. It's an old game..			"

												This is my introduction to the Emergency series, and I am blown away! It's such a simple concept- respond to various situations and instruct your crew to save lives. And yet, it's nearly impossible to master. I will send an ambulance to a seemingly ordinary cardiac arrest call, but in minutes, the whole block could be up in flames because a bomb went off! There is a wide array of emergency vehicles to dispatch, and each have their own advantages. It's up to you to learn them. It can definately be challenging and frustrating at times (I once had a riot that had over 50 causalties to attend to), but it's a fun game with many hours of replayability. The campaign mode is fun and immersive (while challenging). Yes, the game does have a few flaws. Occasionally, you may experience a crash. Other times, the graphic interface may flicker. There is definitely room to improve on, which is why I can't wait to buy the newest of the series.It is worth the $5- I have personally invested 12 hours as of this review, and won't be quitting soon.

												Pretty solid game, very fun however can get a bit extreme (seriously never ending waves of protestors... qq).The Los Angeles mod is a great mod and you should get it if you get this game, it adds a lot more units, vehicles and 10 new missions I believe. All missions are challenging, which is nice, and some require to use all 4 departments (Fire, Medic, Police and Engineering) to complete a mission. I believe in one mission (I think its from the LA mod) you had to use the engineers to get into an airport because the gates were locked.Great game, I grabbed it for 50% and I must say it was a steal!Edit 2 (adding more info and what not): Recently installed NYC, London and US Army mods. Great mods! NYC and London are fantastic, however the US Army mod is too much for me man... too complex. ;)Nonetheless, I love the London mod. Probably my favourite mod, since I live in the UK. Modding this game is easier than modding GTA 4 if anyone played that... as simple as opening up an installer and selecting a file. Boom!This game offers a wide range of callouts, and the campaign has some really fun missions (currently just finished mission 4). There is a total of 20 missions, and some mods, like the LA mod offers additional missions if you wish to do those. Between each mission is a period of free play, where you respond to a variety of fire, medic and police calls throughout the city to get funds to buy vehicles to help in the next mission(s). Outside of the campaign you have free mode and challenge mode. Free mode is basically the same thing as the inbetween missions bit, but there are no missions but just call outs, which I like (it is what I play all the time so) and challenge mode... haven't tried that yet, but I will give it a go. Might be fun, who knows?Update 1: 14/02/15Played a little bit, still with London Mod. Ohh man this mod is amazing! Since I'm new to the Emergency series I don't know how to tackle half the calls so I ended up calling in 3 armed response vehicles to an illegal demonstration. topg.Nonetheless I am still to try Challenge mode. Will try that when I have time, if I don't forget. Also I should play more of the campaign missions, I'm only on like... 4, maybe 5? Will update review as I progress through this fun game ;^)			"

SummaryMy rating: 85/100I've been playing this game for over 280 hours, and i'm nowhere near bored of it. It's a very fun management game with just the right balance of micro-management and automation. You can control the emergency services in a city. While the base game can get boring fairly quickly, there is a HUGE amount of completely game changing mods available that I definitely recommend.Positive- This game will provide entertainment for a very long time.- A huge amount of game-changing mods are available.- This game has just the right balance of micro-management and automation.- This game is fairly realistic.- After 8 years, this game is still going strong.Negative- The base game is slightly lacking in content.- The graphics, which are by no means bad, are a little bit outdated.

The micromanging is not extremely heavy though there is still a lot to manage, so don't expect complete automation.I haven't tried the LA mod that everyone has mentioned but I'll be sure to try it after finishing the regular campaign.

												The only game I've played so far where you have to deal with a hostage situation, a bomb threat and an earthquake all at once.Outlandish freeplay events aside (but freeplay in this game can get that hectic, even early on, just so you know). This is the perfect game for a emergency dispatch simulator, commanding police, fire, medical and engineering services. This game requires you to be quick and adaptive to the situation with 20 mission campaign from small not really threatening call outs to major disasters. It's obiviously based on European emergency services but there are mods available for North American services if you prefer. The highly praised LA Mod being one of them.Word of warning, As this game was designed to be played on older computers. If you have a powerful CPU, traffic lights in freeplay will change absurdly fast, not giving traffic a chance to go nor stop. Resulting in gridlocked streets. "

												In 911 First Responders you take control of emergency forces in their mission to help people in need. A challenging Singleplayer Campaign will see you rescue hostages, extinguish forest fires, deliver humanitarian aid in a 3rd world country and even fight chemical disasters. The games engine is outdated by now and pathfinding of units is sluggish at best but it's still pleasing to look at your units rushing down the roads flashing their sirens. You will be able to take control of the Police, Fire Brigade, Medical Services and even technical help centres that can tow vehicles, use cranes to get crashed vehicles out of rivers, SAR Helicopters, Technicians to fix broken traffic lights and railroad crossings and much more. The game still has a very active modding community. Truly the best aspect of the game however is it's multiplayer with its challenge and endless mode. You can team up with 3 other people to take control of a city's emergency forces and help prevent disaster... and you'll know disaster when a riot starts or a chemical plant catches on fire, you'll need good co-ordination of all forces to make it through.A great multiplayer, an alive modding community and very fun gameplay make up for the small bugs you can encounter here and there. It's cheap and it's fun. If you always wanted to see how well you can manage emergency forces (by yourself or with 3 friends!), give it a go! 4.5/5			"

												Look at how many hours I have for this game. I love it. Game is designed to be modded (meaning have mods made for the game). Many many mods are out there for both fictional and real American & European cities (and some for places in other countries too!). Default multiplayer is bugged and you need to be on same wifi/internet to play multiplayer, BUT there is a software called Hamachi that allows you to play from different wifi/internets. Just have everyone who is playing join a free server you can set up, and whoever is hosting will give their Hamachi IP (not in game IP) to the others to type into Direct IP connect to connect to the multiplayer game. I would recommend this game to anyone. Better than all the other games (even newer ones) in my opinion (and many others too).			"

												I wish there was a middle ground between recommending and not recommending, but until such time as that exists, I will stick to my status of 'not-recommending'. But with some positive points.Allow me to clarify:I see a lot of positive reviews for this game, and I know it was a product of its era, but I really struggle to wrap my brain around this one. Aside from a few issues where save games were mysteriously deleted, I found that before I could get my hands on a campaign mission I had to wade through inane emergency after inane emergency.Quick! Someone's had a fall and has a minor injury! (A minor injury? Like a sprained ankle? Fine, they can wait while I tend to the three fires going on and the pickpocket on the loose) - I return a minute or two later and find that the person had DIED from their minor injuryI eventually did get into the campaign and tried the first two 'levels' - but really it seems that there is a formula for dealing with them, and deviating *at all* makes things difficult.Pathfinding is ridiculous - roads are a mere suggestion - and I know there's the ages-old argument about depth vs simplicity, but requesting a fire truck, then waiting for it, then selecting it when it arrives, then clicking near to the fire emergency, then asking your firefighters to get out, then asking your firefighters to equip themselves with fire hoses, then asking your firefighters to attach their equipped fire hoses to separate fire hydrants dotted around the area, THEN finally asking them to put out the fire (Though the hitbox often means you end up cooling a building and not attacking the fire), it does get rather tiresome. When the fire is out , reasonably you'd expect them to tackle any other fires in their immediate vicinity, but no, they will stand about and wait for the order - often while you're doing other things - so the fire spreads yet further. THEN once the fire is out, you tell your firefighters to disconnect the hoses, put the gear away, then get back in the vehicle before either shuttling them to the next fire or sending them back to HQ.It is very difficult to manage time in this game, and completing campaigns often means failing them often enough until you know the formula. It's a very stressful game at the best of times!I really can see the appeal, and Hardcore RTS fans may very well be all over this, but this game is not for me, and certainly not one I'd recommend for the casual or average gamer...!THAT ALL SAID - apparently there are plenty of mods which make this game a lot more playable.

												I mean, it's O.K. I'm not exactly one to write an essay about games. So. If you like this game, don't get it, get a different game. I have it in my library, I think it's called ""Emergency 20XX (It gave me multiple versions"" and there's another one, get these instead. At least in those games. The ambulances RETURN after taking patients to the hospital, this allows you to avoid calling 10000 ambulances when you don't need them. They have all the same units. You may even think they are identical (Part of the reason I got the game), but the other games are pretty much just a more polished version of this game.			"

												This is borderline negative. I really want to like this game and can see the appeal, and i'd love to get as far as the airport level shown in the screenshots. However so far it seems to be more of a speed clicking, click, click, click game and remember where all the buttons are and clicking on all items as quickly as possible along with people route finding that does not always do what I want it to do. Graphics are OK for an almost 10 year old game, and what I had read sequels are much worse with less options and more buggy than this one. I might change this after playing more, but this game just does not seem like it is for me.			"

												-dispatch reported a small bush fire next to a gas station.- sent a small firetruck with two firemen to put it out.- firetruck got stuck in tailback caused by a cop halting traffic I forgot from an hour earlier.- small bush fire turned into a mass fatality explosion and chemical fire from adjacent container depot, spreading huge blaze to half the map.- budget balancing meant only 1 ambulance to transport 20 dead bodies.10/10 would burn again.

												This game is a real-time strategy game in which the player must command emergency services during a wide variety of situations.It is also the digital embodiment of stress and panic.Now the game does have a story-line but I haven't played it, I just play free mode in which you can play an endless game as emergencies occur across the city and you must command all your resources.At first it is deceptively relaxing. The occasional stroke, small fire, or pickpocket to deal with. Then situations get more and more severe and more and more frequent Not gradually, it just spikes and spikes up.Before you know it your fingers are moving across your keyboard at lightning speed as your rapidly clicking the minimap to bring you all over the city to deal with 10 situations at once. Those situations can also create more situations.Example:- I receive word that there is an unauthorized demonstration going on in the north part of town. I look over there and it's just some guy with a sign shouting ""Resist!"". So I send a police car over and pay the man no mind.- Then there is a traffic accident on the other side of town and one of the vehicles involved is now in the river along with the driver. So I'm sending ambulances, some firefighters, a divert, some tow trucks and a crane.- While this is happening a rabid dog is on the loose. I send some armed police to go deal with it.- I have now forgotten about the Unauthorized demonstration.- Now I'm micromanaging the traffic accident. Having the firefighters pry open one of the cars to rescue the injured driver and shoving them in an ambulance. The diver is slow as a turtle but ends up attaching a buoy to the submerged vehicle so the crane can pull it out of the water.- I check back on the rabid dog and instruct the officers to put it down. A civilian was injured so I deploy an ambulance and bring the officers back to HQ.- The other car in the accident is out of the water and the firefighters pry it open, Sadly the driver is already deceased. I have the towtrucks recover the vehicles and send it all back to HQ.- The ambulance aiding the injured civilian (that may have rabies now) is on the scene and I micromanage the process and then bring it back to HQ.- I have now noticed that there is a fire on the minimap. Though since I wasn't notified it wasn't part of the Endless modes generated emergencies.- Turns out that Unauthorized demonstration has grown from one man to a full blown mob on a rampage that has started a large fire and killed the officer that I sent.- I kick into high gear. I deploy all of my officers and ambulances to the scene along with a hydro-pup equipped armored vehicle. I decide not to risk any fire fighters and just pay a bunch of in-game money to have an airplane drop a load of water onto the building.- I ignore the medical and criminal emergencies that pop up while I organize my forces to put down the riot. Though I do divert attention to any fires.-So my police forces arrive and attempt to put down the riot non-lethally. While the officers are over-whelmed the hydro tank is able to repel the rioters just fine. Sadly the water plane hasn't arrived yet so the fire is still going. Since I am monitoring 5 places at once I am too late to notice that the hydro tank caught fire and exploded. Killing multiple officers.- Many rioters are injured, but whenever any civilians walk by and see the riot they join in, so their numbers keep growing while I keep losing my officers.- Eventually matters grow grave. So I lure the rioters into a parking lot and let them attack the remaining police cruisers. The area is now on fire. I make sure to contain the fire and the rioters inside with my remaining forces.- I should note that during this another traffic accident, a bank robbery, more fires, and a bomb threat have occurred.- Eventually all the rioters are dead or dying. I save as many as I can and deliver the rest to the morgue and breath a sigh of relief.- Then mere seconds later there is an earthquake which causes fires and injuries across the city.- I quit the game so I do not have a heart attack.***********************************************************************************************************************This game with Free-mode alone is quite fun until you get overwhelmed. Then you will be the one needing medical attention.For 5 USD on Steam I say this game is worth it to kill time..			"

												Note that this game is european, you can download LA mod to make it americanThis game is one of the best RTS simulator that I played, I reccomend playing this game with a mod (LA mod 2.1 is reccomended) You can control police,fire dept,EMS, and dept of transportation!DO NOT CHANGE THE RESOLUTION! Pro's -Plenty of mods to choose from-Realistic gameplay (you have to plug a hose into a hydrant before you start using a fire hose)-Control every aspect of your crew!-Freeplay mode is great.-Best version of the EM series-Fun mutiplayer (if you can portforward)-few bugsOkay-dated graphics (okay because this game is old) Cons -Mutiplayer requires port-forwarding-(LA mod) FPS drops-Citizen AI is stupid,Never running away from explosions and fire,when you halt them they will wait and as soonas you stop halting they all come in.-Frustrating mission rules for example get your units away from this square ,but it still detects you 5 feet away from the lineI reccomend this game with mods, Mods enhance the game a lot!With mods 9/10 w/o mods 7/10 EDIT: This game is a must buy with mods. This is my introduction to the emergency series ,but sadly the other games in the series arn't as good as this one. The community is basically dead, you rarely see public mutiplayer sessions. "

												fun game, but I dont understand why when your rescuing people your guys are just walking, I mean come on they need to be atleast running to get each things done, were talking about life and death here. I enjoy the concept, but wish they moved a little quicker rather than just walked, I already know what most will say that theres a fast forward button there, i dont want to speed up the scenario. Im just saying they need to run. other than that the game is pretty cool, I tried to do double the work like put out a fire in one area and rescue somebody on the other side of the city. eventually making a lot of money to buy stuff with.

												I picked this up for $1.50 during a recent Humble Store sale and I'll say it was well worth the price and is definitely worth the $5 it usually sells for. A nice little RTS. I didn't play it for long but I liked what I saw so far. It has a nice charm to it and the missions I played through are pretty interesting. My only complaint is that the controls take a little getting used to; it's really easy to accidentally send a firefighter to the other side of the map on foot. I bought""911: First Responders"" mostly for my young son who's really into firemen and police. He's still too young to play the game but he sits on my lap while I play and has a blast. The game looks like it will have some staying power since the graphics aren't cutting edge but such that they'll still look good by the time he's old enough to play the game himself. I'm not a big RTS fan but this is one game in the genre that I'll play every now and then for the fun of it.			"

												I really question if people actually played this when they reviewed it AND played the newer emergencies. They're virtually the same only THIS one is actually worse and ""mod support"" is a bit specious really. It's been modded, sure, some great ones, but it's not exactly as mod friendly as people make it out to be versus the other ones. This one just happened to get modded.More importantly, this game has ALL the path finding issues, stupid AI, broken missions (The hacker mission is particularly broken) as the newer emergency games BUT it also has atrocious controls and delegation methods, at least the newer games fixed that. You have to wonder if people mindlessly praise this game while mindlessly bashing the others is only because this game isn't called by its original name of Emergency 4....It's a decent game with many critical flaws but it's certainly no Emergency or Emergency 2 or even 3. And since it's, in reality, NOT better than Emergency 2013/14/15 I really see no reason to recommend it over them since they do actually solve some issues while sharing all the same that this one has.

												Very confused...Not sure why all the glowing reviews on this title. I can literally make this game crash in the exact same place every single time I try to play. The GUI is loaded with template-style buttons and switches and most of the missions turn into a click-fest right out of the gate. I am saying all of this based on very limited playtime because I cannot proceed past a certain point early in the game, hence the afore-mentioned predictable crash. The devs are conspicuously absent, I was hoping at a minimum they would patch the game so that I could actually play past the intro. Can I have my money back?			"

												This game had so much hype over it. I remember playing it years before this, but somehow back then it was better, or maybe it was another game? This Steam game is just a no-no, it's buggy, forces you to replay missions because something bugged out, AI is sometimes just stupid, the firefighters/medics wont get out of the car themself so you need to click on them every single time. That's just annoying, i had to replay a mission not once, not twice, but three times because one patient magically dissapered. After a while it gets boring and frustrating. I got it on a Winter Sale for almost 1 euro and i got 11 hours into it. I regret it. It would be a good game if it wasn't that bugged.			"

												If you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients- To Make the Dough375 grams (3 cups) plain flour1/2 teaspoon salt2 eggs1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) waterExtra flour for dusting - To Make Cheese Filling15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.1/2 cup cheddar cheese2 eggs, lightly beaten1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon pepper- ExtrasYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)Parmesan cheeseBasilFried vegetablesShrimpFish slicesChicken pieces Make the Ravioli filling.- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough.- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!(No but seriously this game is lit)			"

												Pros: Fun when it works. Good team based multiplayer coop (LA Mod) Base game is boring and very repetable. Cons: BUGS BUGS BUGS-Multiplayer you have to port forward to host (most games you dont, they have stable multiplayer platforms)-Multiplayer crashed whole game. After you play a little bit everything becomes clustered, bad traffic, cars become frozen in place, most useful commands can only be used by host. If other use commands the stuff dissapears for all the other players.-Very hard to find players-Map doesnt load properly for half people, have to diable all shadows.-Jump in a coop game and you cant move your units around, you have to quit and reload game.-Directing traffic works half of the time.This game has a huge learning curve on how to play around major bugs.

												Let me start off saying that I love simulation games, and this was no exception. This game is still extremely playable, even in this age. I enjoyed the full range of vehicles and the spectrum of which you could control everything. This game leaves it up to you to solve the problem, and doesn't hand you the answer. While it does lack in missions for the police and swat, it makes up for in giving you in depth gameplay to every single disaster that occurs. I'll be happy to enjoy this game for many hours to come.			"

												For a game that's 9 years old, I still love playing it. When I first got the game about 4 years ago I never played Multiplayer because I knew nobody that had it. Just this year I've played multiple amounts of Multiplayer with friends of mine ranging from 2-4 Players per game switching from either LA Mod, NYC, Manhattan, Brooklyn, West Coast Canadian, Fairfax or Harbor City and needless to say we kick serious♥♥♥♥♥when we play. I would recommend this game for ANYONE, even if it may be alittle outdated. I've seen the newer Emergency Games and I'm not impressed with them at all.			"

Send the fire engine. Get everyone out. Grab gear. Go fight the fire. The AI is older and leaves something to be desired. I had a police officer stand and just be shot by the criminal while I was looking elsewhere.Pro: VERY modable!Con: Camera handles like♥♥♥♥♥			"

So realistic, like, you can go inside buildings, physics are mostly realistic etc its just amazing.If you wanted to buy Emergency 5 or Emergency 2016, don't buy that, its way  over price. But this game, for 5 euro? You gotta kidding me!! :) But thanks to Hoppah for creating the LA Mod, its amazing. If you didn't buy the game yet, just go ahead and buy it, its the best strategy game ever! I love it! Thumbs up for the devs! :)			"

												The game is great and I had the much older version that I still play. There is one thing that is annoying though...When those REAL Accidents and Responses occur, there is no time clock that stops you from completing the mission and the missions DO NOT NEED a Time Clock.Once they remove it I will go back to five stars, but for now two stars is only because I have no idea how I would have really done under Normal circumstances. Sorry, it just seem odd to me to have a stop watch for this type of a SIMULATOR. Never Used, Why is it needed?			"

												With over 200 hours on another computer before I downloaded Steam, I'd say this game is by far the best of the Emergency series! 911: First Responders is technically the American version of Emergency 4. In Emergency 4, you take on the role of the Chief of Police, Director of EMS, Fire Chief, and Technical Coordinator. You dispatch units to a call whether it involves crime, medical emergencies, fires, or simply a traffic light failure. You even all four of them for traffic accident, and many other emergencies! I'd recommend downloading the LA Mod for this game, as although the European version is satisfying, the LA Mod is 500x more satisfying and contains almost 200% more units than the vanilla version of Emergency 4. I recommend this game to all lights/sirens enthusiasts; police lovers; Fire and EMS lovers; and even people who are police officers, EMT's, and firefighters in the real world!			"

												For a game that's 9 years old, I still love playing it. When I first got the game about 4 years ago I never played Multiplayer because I knew nobody that had it. Just this year I've played multiple amounts of Multiplayer with friends of mine ranging from 2-4 Players per game switching from either LA Mod, NYC, Manhattan, Brooklyn, West Coast Canadian, Fairfax or Harbor City and needless to say we kick serious♥♥♥♥♥when we play. I would recommend this game for ANYONE, even if it may be alittle outdated. I've seen the newer Emergency Games and I'm not impressed with them at all.			"

 Recommendation : Recommended to purchase Base Game Score : B- (B+ with popular mods) Style : Strategy Recommendation Summary : 911: First Responders (aka Emergency 4) is a strategy game where you solve emergency situations with Fire, EMS, and police units. The base game could use some work, but can stand on it's own well enough. I personally play it while listening to podcasts, but you will enjoy the game while playing both passively and actively.Mods are supported, and multiplayer (and modded multiplayer) is supported also, however you must have some friends to play it with, because online multiplayer is dead.Modding is recommended as it enhances the game with, reskins, more units, and more mission. There is a dedicated modding community that works on mods for this game.			"

You can do more things with the fire department, police and ambulance services and I find that it is a lot better in a mod, as on LA Mod or London Mod, there are literally no limits to what you can do with the units.

Also MOD SUPPORT. There is mod support access. Lots of mods to choose. This game is replicated off emergency 4. However its still outstanding. Highly reccomended. However there is some downside to this game1) Its crashes often depending on what mod2) Its glitchy. 3) You need mods to actully get the game either working good or realistic.On a postive note. Highly recommended.			"

												I like this game a lot. This game does have problems for sure, but they aren't very game breaking. There are total country conversion mods that you can get and they are so easy to install. It supports mods and want you to mod the game pretty much. The NYC mod, LA mod and the UK mods are my favorite personally. The graphics are trash, it's pretty obvious. The original Battlefront looks better than this. But the graphics are a small gripe compared to the game overall. I recommend finding a way to play the game before hand, before you actually buy the game. But you can always ask for a refund from steam if you don't like the game and regret the purchase. Give this game a try I think you will enjoy it.			"

												I've played this game a lot and I love it. They have a ton of mods that give you a lot of different experiences and makes the game even more entertaining. I wish that they would come out with a police simulator where your a cop and you patrol the city and solve crime and you can pull people over and it would be realistic. I would totally recommend this game to my friends because it is a lot of fun!			"

												This game is just awesome, I have nothing but good things to say about it. I usually play the harbor city mod, which is just a great mod. Plus they also fixed the mod installer in this version, Its all just good things to say here nothing bad to this game, not one thing.			"

												This is one of the best emergency strategy games I've played, the amount of mods for em4/911 first responders on sites like http://www.emergency-forum.de/ and http://forum.emergency-planet.com/ and mods so advanced like the wegburg or Welfordshire mods. This game is a absolute dream to play			"

												A great game. 10/10. Would emergency manage again.1 thing though, and I might've missed it, I didn't notice any hotkeys which resulted in frantically looking for the right button to give a command.			"

												This game will NEVER die. If you thought of buying Emergency 5 - Don't. Get this instead. it's 100000000x better with TONS of mods constantly developed.ps. This is >>EMERGENCY 4<<. 911 First Responders is the US title of the game!That's the only difference!			"

												I know I know... This game is old but, doesn't mean people should still play it. This game has mods, besides emergency 5, 6 and 7 dont have any mods you can download. Haven't tried it? Buy it, you will like it. Don't like the first mod? Go and install a mod on emergencyplant. Hope you enjoy this game!			"

												The idea of the game is a great one in my opinion. There could be improvements especially on the police side of the game and some interactions with the paramedics could be improved. I wish there would be another version of this type of game. Great story lines and lovely single player missions. Interesting idea would be to hook up this idea with a multiplayer co-op.			"

												EDITTED ___ I loved this game being a firefighter myself. I know a little about computers so I have added a few mods which made this game AMAZING. However after updating to windows 10 and updating my amd graphics drivers it kept crashing, no error code. I reinstalled everything and now I can't even start the game. I also picked up emergency 5 which the devs made ""2016"". It will not work either, I have done nothing to emergency 5. Stay away is my opinion.=====11/25/2016-- It was my computer that caused the issue, I do recommend this game with mods.			"
