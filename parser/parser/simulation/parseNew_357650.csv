Early Access Review
								EDIT9/2016::So I made a review about this game in March of last year ... And frankly, not much has changed except maybe a graphical upgrade. There is now health-draining weather elements to constrain you to your shelter from time to time, some new enemies with extreme aggro, two crafting stations, one of which is used to break down junk and excessive equipment and the other to create some metal objects, including swords and crafting materials, and farming, which seems redundant with how easily you can find food anyway....Y'know, I hate to say it, but this game still seems like a poor investment on my part. The added features does give the game some additional depth, but it still suffers from a lack of challenge. The new enemies do admittedly make for some excitement considering their fast speed and tendancy to attack in groups, but they're not nearly enough to elevate this game above mediocrity. And as soon as you get a ranged weapon even they don't pose much of a threat.There are plenty of games out there with survival elements to them; some of which focus on hardcore/realistic survival like Project Zomboid and The Long Dark, others which focus on base-building and defence like 7 Days To Die, and others which are just an elaborate excuse to slay enemies with the goal of gathering supplies like State of Decay or Subterrain; but all of the mentioned are good games because they focus on being whatever they are and manage to work in their level of survival to push the player into working hard to either win or just to survive as long as possible. They're fun either because they are challenging or they provide a lot of features and content to make your experience unique. But this game doesn't do anything right. It doesn't provide anything close to the features of 7 Days To Die or Subterrain, it doesn't have the content of Project Zomboid or State of Decay, nor does it test the player like The Long Dark... It's just a plain survival game that has little to offer other than the very basics.Granted, for a two dollar game, this is okay. And the preview of the 0.3 version does show another graphical overhaul on the horizon. But frankly that's just sugar-coating to a very bland pastry. I guess I shouldn't expect too much given that this game only has one coder, but I feel like this guy is in over his head. A survival game needs a lot of attention to detail and knowhow to be accurate, fun or preferably both; something which I feel is beyond that of a single guy and his pet project. But given the opinions of the people who voted on my review, perhaps I'm wrong. Perhaps this game will become better with time... Or maybe it's just two dollars of disappointment.Well, the developer has promised more content on the horizon, so we'll just have to see what happens.EDIT9/2016::First of, I'd like to point out that this is a preliminary review. As in, a comment on how the game stands right now. My attitude towards it will most likely change as it develops.So, let's start off...Right now this game contains about as much content as an average flash game on Newgrounds or Kongregate. It's extremely simple, and once you figure out how to move adequately you can easily fend off attacks by the wildlife (wolves and bears), whose only real difference is their speed. And if the developer reads this: You might want to change that.Your main tools for harvesting the lands are rocks (as in common rocks you find lying on the ground) and axes; both can harvest any kind of harvestable resource (trees and boulders) or kill wildlife. There are also hammers and shovels, though their uses are limited to construction or reshaping the ground respectively, and they can't be used as weapons. Tools used exclusively as weapons include bows and handguns, which can be crafted relatively easily. Their advantage is not only in range, but they also slow your opponents drastically for about two or three seconds, making it far too easy to get in consequtive hits, assuming you have enough ammo. (And it would surprise me if you didn't, since that is also extremely easy to craft.)You can also build your own house! Flooring, walls, doorways and roofs. Out of wood... J-Just wood... Oh, and different kinds of flooring with rocks, and wood... This will obviously be expanded on in the future updates, but right now it's just a bit boring building your own shelter, not to mention unnecessary since the map is littered with abandonned buildings. The only disadvantage to these is that you can't make doors for them, but meh...All in all, I'm sensing the usual potential with early access games here. And if Scott Cawthon has proved anything, it's that single developers can produce good games. But right now, the game is far too limited, and much too easy. And it suffers from the same sort of problem that most survival games has: Hoarding! The game didn't do its description justice... Because as it stands right now, it's just another minimalistic survival game, with the same core ideas and the same problems. So sorry people, but I just can't bring myself to recommend this. And I'm usually a bit TOO NICE in my reviews...! You'd be better off playing Project Zomboid or something. At least that game has some challenge in its early stages...But once again, this is only preliminary. I've put my money on this thing, so I better not be disappointed in the future as well. But I'm an optimist! So I assume that I won't be. :)			"

Early Access Review
 Disclaimer - I have been gifted a free key for this game for review purposes, however my review will be kept as truthful as possible, since I am meant to help developers and buyers/gamers.  Project Explore  review: Overview Project Explore is a top-down sandbox survival game which has lots of potential. Currently realism is one of the major factors of the game (after all, it IS a survival game) which is very well done. There are four needs; health, thirst, hunger and sanity. Most have their unique ways to become satisfied. Thirst is filled by using a drinking item, hunger by eating, sanity by either reading or killing enemies and health by multiple ways; eating, drinking, consuming a healing item or waiting it out while your hunger and thirst needs are mostly full. Hunting creatures is a large portion if the objective since it rewards you with multiple things, such as armor, sanity and food. However, the fighting system is quite literally just hit/miss, run up to the enemy, attack them before they run away, if they chase after you, stop for .05 seconds and then hit them and so on. So you may be asking yourself one thing; is this game worth buying? And if so, why? Isn't it just an isometric remake of AAA games? The answer is, well, the game shows potential other AAA survival games did not. You can lose the game due to a simple mistake early on in the game which evolves raidly in late game. If you went into an enemy stronghold instead of hunting bears, you will be punished. This game will challenge you, don't go adventure because nature will try and best you, but do go venture because you need everything. Gameplay Early game is quite difficult if you have no idea whatsoever of your actions and consequences. The learning curve is very easy to pick up since it's a mostly a generic survival game, the only things slowing new players down are small details , such as drinking straight from the water source instead of needing a canteen or something of the same sort to fulfill thirst. So in a way it is difficult because of the obvious not being so obvious (obvious in real life, not so obvious it would be added into a games' mechanics).  Once you know how to survive, the game is amazing, especially seeing that your base is so large and mostly finished. It adds a factor of achievement, you can now see for all the days you have survived just how much progress you have done, even what was un-needed was added. Building mechanics are fun and intriguing, the worst part during building is probably laying down the ceiling. You can only place ceiling when it is right next to a wall. This is a large problem while making structures on a larger scale since you need to make a maze if you'd like to add a ceiling. Another con of this topic is ho the doors open and close, it's quite difficult to close them behind you  sometimes. The combat system is terrible and will definitely be improved, it's one of the few flaws I've seen so far, but the worst one. Over time you will become overrun with loot which will be rendered useless, so you can't do anything about that apart from exchange it into materials. Pros and Cons Pros:Addictive gameplayMostly realisitcFrequently updatedLoads of timesBuiling is very well doneGUI doesn't get in the wayCons:Combat system is flawedWhatever you build resets after you load the game back up  I have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game.

								Project Explore is a charming survival game which is steadily getting fleshed out content. I am impressed by how much has been added to the game when I first got 100% achievements on it. I can only look forward in anticipation to see what else the developer has in store for the game!+ The game currently has a lot of nice crafting options.+ Enemies can pose a threat in the right conditions.+ Lots of ways to die.+ Consistent updates.+ Most of the achievements are designed to introduce players to the newly added features.- I would like to see more variety in the generated housing.- I would like to to see less of the monotonous achievements where you do something 500 times over.

								Not a bad little game. It's still a work in progress. Survival in it's simplest form. Hunt, Defend, Build, Loot & keep your Sanity. Crafting system is easy enough and there's several items you're able to craft. The Construction part is plain and simple. It's top down only so, you're not going to build anything like you can in Mine Craft therefore, it's not a clone. It's not bug free, mind you as with all Early Access games so, keep your sanity and read the books.			"

								Just as the introduction video on the store page initially ""described"" the game in just over a minute, it didn't take a lot of play for me to realize there wasn't much substance here yet.  Will there ever be more - maybe, but it seems that it will take a long time before this is really an actual playable game to come out of this ""Project.""I'd give it another six months to a year before purchasing, just make sure you check for any updates that happened during that time first.

								Started the game and felt like a weakling so avoided any combat1st day: Gathered rocks, chopped wood looted houses, roamed around. spent night at house2nd day:found axe, so started to kill wolves kept roaming and looting houses got knife - 2hit wolf n bear spent night at house studying the craftables3rd day: Had all i need - food, weapons. got bored had to play 2 more nights to get achievementPros: Appealing graphics Decent ambiet music Easy combat and UI Quite interesting book title edits, for example ""Fifty Shades Of Grass"" or ""Tail Of Two Girls & Thy Cup""Cons: Textures (trees) sometimes like to disappear Wolf and bears can go through walls , not sure if at certain spots and times, or just when they're randomly wandering Even tho you're not moving or no animal around you, you can hear footsteps time to time (could be ambiet music, not sure, had it on low didnt pay that much attention) Nothing new that i haven't  seen in Salem (as well as their 2d game), Project zomboid or Don't starve No fullscreen option (Edit: now there is, although after saving the game it goes back to windowed and you have to re-enable it once again) Now you can just walk against a wall of random house too see through ceiling what's inside Even if the game is only in early access the prices still is too high for such small contentOverall:The game starts quite fun and interesting like any other survival game, but cause of early access (aka lack of content) you lose the interest quite fast. If the devs will keep on working and won't bail after getting the money, it can turn out to be one really addictive and loveable 2D survivor game which doesnt include zombies.			"

								> Day 1 > Wander around all day not knowing exactly what to do> Night starts falling> Go into an abandoned house, not sure what comes out at night> Three bears line up at the door like I'm a homeless shelter giving out soup> imnotyoursoupslut.jpg> Equips pickaxe that I robbed off of a corpse> Opens door > Bears roll into my shelter at the speed of sound and surround me> Revenant flashbacks> ""The dust is making it hard to breathe""> are you sure it isn't this bear orgy i let into our home> are> you> sureFun game, 10/10 would recommend hosting more homeless bear orgies in abandoned houses.Onto a more serious critique, even with the little time I've spent in this game, I got a lot done. Minus the bear death.In its current state, if you're looking for a cheap game to pick up for a few hours, I definitely recommend this one, especially if you think Don't Starve is too overhwelming. You'll get the same feel with simpler gameplay and mechanics. For the little time I spent in the game (on a small map), I refurnished an abandoned house and got revenge on the bears.However, I do have a few gripes. I'm aware that this game is pretty young, so I definitely hope that the developer is still reading through reviews.• Was it just me, or can you not refill empty water bottles? I was dehydrating fast and staring longingly at the numerous puddles/lakes I kept passing, spamming every button I had in a desperate attempt to fill my bottles. On a small map, I quickly ran out of things to quench my thirst and could not, for the life of me, find any sort of drink from looting. • While inside of a house, sometimes I was affected by the dust storm and sometimes I wasn't. • The fire was a bit confusing. Does it drain sanity? Sometimes my sanity would go down and other times it went up. I'm not sure why fire would drain sanity when I'm standing in the dark.• Speaking of sanity, I had no clue how to restore it, which seemed like an important tip to mention during the tutorial. It just went up or drained whenever it wanted to. I had a few close call nights and was panick-clicking everything I could in a vain attempt to combat how fast it was draining.Other than those few things, I'm definitely going to put some real hours into this game. Just playing for a few minutes sparked my creativity. I'd love a purely sandbox mode if more building options are added, since I can already see wood and stone becoming a problem. Currently, trees don't seem to be a renewable resource.			"

If you go to the developers profile you will see what I mean. Someone commented on the devs profile ""-rep worst porn star ever"" or something like that and all the developer said back was this; ""+rep (trolls name) was recognized as porn star"".

								Garbage.Everything about this game is poor.  It looks like it was made from a downloadable template and it shows.  Graphics are junk, control design is unintuitive, and its just poorly implemented all around.  If your using the mouse with one hand, why spread the other keys all over the keyboard.  Terrible design.Before I wrote this review, I decided to browse the other reviews, game website, and community page.  I am uber experienced in playing games. And with that, I am also uber experienced in programming.  Some of the developers comments are exceptionally questionable.  Anyone who downloads a game engine identifies themselves as a developer like anyone picking up a golf club says they are a golfer.260 FPS?  Why boast such nonsense.  If I have 1000 cores, am I only going to get 260 FPS?  If I have a 75mhz pentium, am I going to get 260 FPS?  Pushing new updates on a daily basis?  What does that mean?  If there is no substance to an update, it doesn't matter if you push 100 updates a day.  Based on what the publisher has stated, there is no doubt the non existent multiplayer aspect of this game is going to follow the same terrible design of whats already implemented.Sadly, I don't see foresee this game improving at all.  There is no content.  And there is no experience behind the designer.   Even if this game were free, its still not worth downloading.  If you want to make a $7 donation to buy this, that is up to you.  Unfortunately, that's not going to change any of the flaws associated with this product.			"

								Well, just played an hour or so of the new early access release ‘Project Explore’. It’s another…survival game. Woo.See I love the genre, however, this one isn’t doing anything special. It’s a top down version of ‘Insert Survival Game Here‘. There’s not much to do though. It’s very early on in it’s development cycle.You play a nondescript character, in a nondescript world, collecting the same things as usual to build a base for no reason.I’ve only run into two different mobs (a wolf and a bear) and chopped down some trees, and crushed some rocks. It took all of 20 minutes to build everything.

			Took a first look of the early access release of Project Explore. Available via Steam Here - http://store.steampowered.com/app/357650/ -- Watch live at http://www.twitch.tv/early_access...		

Video May Still Be Uploaing.You can take a look at my first hour with ‘Project Explore’ about and choose for yourself.At this time I can’t recommend it there’s just way to many survival games doing it better, even in early access.However, I think maybe in the future when it has more content and the multi-player is implemented this could be a fun top-down ‘Rust’ or ‘DayZ’.

								Read these before reading my review! Vhttp://www.l45ltd.co.uk/developer-blog/project-censorshiphttp://www.l45ltd.co.uk/developer-blog/project-what-are-you-doinghttp://www.l45ltd.co.uk/developer-blog/project-resolutionCurrently at the moment, I do not recommend this game.It is a nice concept, a nice start. The Pros Ok, so this game looks alright for an ""Early Access"" game, the good things about the game is :The GraphicsThe graphics aren't half bad when it comes to an early access simple top down survival game,I like the 3d-looking effect when walking around near structures.The craftingThe crafting isn't too bad, it is easy to find out how to use, and is quite simple for someone who hasn't used a tutorial or played before.Okay, now onto the cons of this game.The ConsLakes, water in generalThe lakes look so unrealistic it's crazy, they are just symmetrical squares in the form of what a lake might look like, it's like a lake made of legos. You cannot swim in the game, and the water in general is unrealistic and looks bad.Survival MechanicsIt's not hard at all to survive in this game, the thirst and food mechanic aren't even really made properly, I can have 0 hunger, but drink something that brings my health up and live forever. The only way to die in this game is to reach 0 health, so don't worry about thirst or food, med-kits will do you forever. Thirst is insanely odd. You must find a water bottle to get thirst up, and they are quite hard to find. That is one of the only ways to get thirst up, not sure if you are able to craft anything like that, either.AnimalsAh, the animals. These animals are quite odd, and very easy to kill. Do not beware of bears, wolves, or whatever, as they run the same speed as you, and you just grab a rock, run backwards, and click. Boom, they're dead. The developer(s) should put more time into animal mechanics, as they are also quite wonky at the time. Not to mention the wall glitching that happens frequently, I always find an animal either stuck half-way in a wall or stuck inside of a building and not able to get out because the collision in this game is also kind of poo. Updated:The collision is still quite poo, as stated above, but other than that, I think that the AI and animals in general are worse.. Now they are quite hard to kill, and impossible to get away from. I'll give an example from my own gameplay. A wolf is chasing me. (they now go faster than the player), the wolf bites me, I use my sprint or whatever spacebar is, and get some distance, but after pressing spacebar, there is a large delay, that keeps the player held back. That gives time for the enemy to move forward and kill you. So, overall, I like the old AI better, it still needs a bit of work. As for the collision, it needs alot of work. Things still glitch into walls, and into trees, etc. InventoryAh, the inventory. The inventory in this game is quite bad, in my opinion. The design of it looks quite bland, and the colors are hard to differentiate. The accuracy in which dragging and dropping has is very bad, only on certain occasions do my items actually move in the inventory. This needs alot more work.A bugI decided to add this little bug here, since I can no longer post on the Project Explore forums. When I load or start a new game, the framerate is in the negatives. Recently it was -1492 FPS when starting a new game. It's not an important bug, but I still feel it should be fixed in the final product.SummaryDon't buy this game yet, wait until alot of bugs are fixed and lots have been done in the game to make sure you get the most out of it, as currently, it needs lots of work.Thanks for reading! :)			"

								1-English2-Spanish1- Ok, i know i need to play more but for now what i can say is that this looks promising and is already fun, although it still misses more content but that's in progress.This game is a tiny (about 8mb!) survival game without zombies, but with wolves and bears for you to hunt (or for you to be eaten). Already has about 30 or so  items to craft, including construction blocks for your house, weapons (gun, bow), campfires and the usual tools (axe, shovel, hammer). You can also go fishing if you don't dare to go hunting yet.View is 2D top/down with some 3D objects (like houses or trees). Simple, but effective and the movement works very well. I don't like very much the attack/gather with right mouse button because it doesn't have an animation for your action and is not very clear what are you doing.All in all, tiny fun game for all of you who, as me, like survival games and also building and crafting a little. It also has a reasonable price, so Recommended, of course.2- Sé que debo jugar algo más pero por ahora puedo decir que el juego promete y es divertido de jugar, aunque por supuesto le falta contenido pero ya están trabajando en ello.Es un jueguecito minúsculo (8 mb!) de supervivencia sin zombies pero con lobos y osos para que caces (o para que te coman). Actualmente tiene como unos 30 objetos o así para fabricar, incluyendo bloques para hacerte una casa, armas (arco, pistola), fuego de campamento y las herramientes habituales (hacha, pala, martillo). Incluso puedes pescar si no te atreves aún a ir de caza. La vista es de arriba a abajo en 2D, con algunos objetos 3D en el mapa como las casas o los árboles. Simple pero queda bien y el movimiento es fluido y está bien trabajado. Una cosa que no me convence es el ataque/recolección con el botón derecho del ratón, porque no tiene ninguna animación y no queda muy claro lo que estás haciendo.En fin, considerándolo todo, es un jueguecito divertido para todos aquellos que, como yo, les gustan los juegos de supervivencia con algo de construcción y fabricación. Además, el precio es más que razonable así que Recomendado, por supuesto.			"

Then I findout that`s not river, can`t drink from the sea, ditch the 2nd base.Bored of beating animals, so I got some metal, and craft a pistol....???????what????Now I`m growing tomatos, to lazy to go explore.Most survival games ♥♥♥♥ players up so hard, but this one does not.Waiting for more memes.

								As of now it's still very much early access. That said the Devs have been doing a good job coming out with frequent updates so no worries there. They make LOTS of references to other stuff, pepe, where the normal things are, jordan freeman, white mesa, two girls one chalice (yea figure that one out). Game play is pretty good, learning curve isnt very steep, died almost instantly in the first game, bludgeoning everything to death with a rock just doesnt cut it. Oh, huge thing, possibly game breaking since were all so used to it... you cant punch down trees. That said, for $5 the product is very unfinished, after about an hour of playing you get to OP and the game is no longer enjoyable. However this game does look very promising, so if you don't wanna mess with early access but it looks interesting, add it to you wishlist and watch it!5/7 would read 2 girls 1 chalice again			"

								If you want a good and fun survival game which is in early access well this is the game for ya! It's got some pretty good house building but only those who are truly creative would be able to make some good houses. Basically, it's a fun game and it's achievements are.. well, achievable. And beware of a bug that you might sadly possibly encounter. When you save and turn off the game you should probably take your most important items into your inventory in case the game decided to delete parts of your house like it has for me. Otherwise, it's pretty fun even with it's seemingly small amount of content.			"

								I personally like this Game, what I dont like are Game devs bickering amongst them selves I mean surely this is not how game devs should be acting but instead should talk to each other away from the public eye and maybe give each other advice from theire own developing expirience, seeing at least 3 game devs one of which made this game acting like children well to be honest it just puts me off playing or voting for any of the games they make.This is a good game and Seabass is constantly working on it so I do recommend it.BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP BICKERING LIKE LITTLE KIDS ITS UNPROFESSIONALl AND OFF PUTTING FOR THE COMMUNITY.I would like to add however for some one with only 20 mins game play to leave a bad review is shocking I mean atleast give it a chance.

								Great top down game, easy to play as you can figure everything out as you go. A simple yet engaging and fun experience with few biomes, many items, plenty of building materials and great mobs. Good value for it's price, the game is reasonable however probably needs quite a few more things still.The developer works hard on updates every day and regularly does things to the game which is always a good sign. You can find the official wiki of the game here!       (http://wiki.projectexploregame.com/index.php/Main_Page).-= The Good =-() Easy gameplay() Many menus and settings() Good particles, like with the rain() Does not take over my hard drive() Regular updates() Good building interface-= The Bad =-() Barely any biomes and water has no coast, picture a blue piece of paper next to a green piece of paper!() Still no Multiplayer :(() Animals are as dumb as my cat, (My cat is a dumb blonde)() Needs way more items and crafting.() Needs electronics and more advanced types of crafting.() Seriously lacks bosses and big twists in the game, like massive events you have to prepare for.Overall, the game is simple, easy and fun, you should just buy it and try it out for yourself. 7.5/10 "

								I'm going to be really honest with you guys. The game lacks a bit. That being said it is still fun. I would have to rate this game a 7/10Only problems I encountered were that certain things weren't working. Such as the metal crafting table. I put in some metal to create some nails and springs and nothing popped out. Not to mention that items seem to go into a void if you mine or cut with a full inventory.To say that this game has potential is not giving it credit for what it is. Its a fun game nonetheless. I can say it gave me a 2d feeling of rust throughout the entire time I was playing. Again I would give the game a 7/10. Maybe its not as polished due to it being in beta/alpha. Great game Sebastian I hope you can release more for this game or another game altogether!			"

I began to have micro stuttering.  Like severe micro stuttering to the point where the game wasn't even playable.  My system specs are:A10-7700k 3.8ghz quad coreGTX 650TI14 Gbs of ramEven with this I couldn't even run the game with all those wolves/doggies, it felt like 10fps even though it says I'm getting above the 100 - 200fps range.I'm giving this game a thumbs up, but the only problem I see is this micro stuttering needs to be fixed :C			"

								It's a cool game! Great concept and already quite fun even if it's very early alpha. It's got some nice mechanics, you can build houses, craft stuff, and all the other things that you'd expect from a survival game. It's introduced a sanity mechanic which is a nice addition. There are some rough edges, and not very much content like in most of early access games(But that's why they're EA), but the developer is pretty cool and dishing out updates quite often. Overall, i'd recommend it to people who enjoy survival games, this one has some potential.10/10 would bury dead animals again.			"

								I do recommend this game. In fact, I've gifted it to two people already. You'll go through and see a few negative reviews on it, but here's my take:This game is an Early Access Game. I've been in contact with the developer personally and he describes it as ""Pre-Alpha."" So, with this in mind, the game is going to have a few flaws. Another review mentioned how ""the game is nowhere near ready for sale."" True fact. Which is why the developer is still working to improve upon the game even as I'm typing this.I would just like to point out a few things: The game is fun. It has controls that are easy to get used to. Currently the game has 153 unique items that serve their own purpose. There are currently 5 unique mobs, a 6th to be released with the next update. The building system is fun and easy. The crafting system is as well. All around, this is a great game that you can run on virtually any computer. I mentioned the next update. The next update is going to be released in approximately 2 weeks. From what I hear, it's going to be a huge update. I don't want to go into details and spoilers, so I won't mention any specific additions. However, I will mention that there are going to be an indescribable number of bug fixes for every bug that has been reported by the community. And there will be quite a bit of new content from what I understand. You can find additional information in the Community Hub.Overall, I feel that currently I can not actually give the game a rating because it is not complete. But if I had to rate it, I would give it a solid 7.3 out of 10. That number is sure to go up as bugs are fixed and the game progresses.			"

								REVIEW WILL CHANGE AS THE GAME DEVELOPS AND UPDATES:I was expecting the game to be pretty great, and it really is. It takes many elements existent in other survival games such as Minecraft and adds new elements that make the game fresh enough to be different from the rest. There are certainly things needed to be fixed here and there, but nothing big enough to ruin gameplay. My only complaints thus far are the very low rate at which animals spawn and how easy it is to get lost (while some could say this is an intended design element, it would be nice to at least be able to produce a compass or map that would lead you back to your home). In the end, I would definitely say the game is worth it's current price, and considering the price will probably go up as the game is developed, it'd be better to get it now than later.			"

								Circa 0.1.2.2 Do you like the mystery of entering an empty room and finding an item (or items) that you could craft with a couple clicks of punching a tree or a rock?  Then this is the game for you!Seriously, a super early access game.  There's not much here, nor should there need to be at this point.  There's a world surrounded by water that you can't fish in, there's two types of animals and some bird shadows, a bunch of empty buildings with stuff that's easy to obtain if you don't mind clicking the ""stick"" button 30 times in the crafting menu, some sand areas that seem to spawn less animals, a night cycle, and some water areas that you can fish in.  The interesting stuff comes in when you go insane, which ironically doesn't happen if you kill enough animals (and bury them).  But yah, there's no point in hiding that there isn't a lot going on in this game yet.  And that's A-OK.  It has a great atomsphere with some effective mechanics, and even if you know you've got nothing else to do it still sucks you in.  That's probably the greatest victory of Project Explore.  There really isn't a lot to explore (yet), but it still makes you want to keep exploring it.			"

								The developer deletes and censors criticism in the forums!  Very good review with developer responses and background story about the developer!Even more fun stuff to read...[www.l45ltd.co.uk]Don´t support this!I got it from a bundle... EDIT: Since the dev posted... i found out, where i got this from. It was a giveaway! So it wasn´t sold in a bundle. For the dev ""free giveaway"" doesn´t sound cheap, but being in a bundle... *FacepalmAwesome logic, but logical thinking isn´t one of his assets obviously (read the linked pages above for more about that!). Telling the truth and standing up against criticism neither (again, see above!).The only thing that might be positive for some, is the crafting system... Decidefor yourself, if that´s enough for you. I didn´t enjoy it at all!Edit: I gave this ""game"" another chance, since the dev has an artist now. I still can´t recommend it at all.You see your character from a top-view position, but the animals use some kind of a side-view (a bit like don´t starve. get that instead of this cr.ap).Interesting for collector´s maybe, but if you want to have fun in your games... this is definitely not for you then. It´s boring like watching grass grow, but at least you would be outside in nature... ;)I can´t see any change, that would make this game a good game. There are enough survival games already and much better ones too. Get one of those and don´t support developer like this. Censoring and stuff like that is absolutely unprofessional. There are many devs, who can take any criticism, because they stand behind their games! "

								I've got to spend a little bit of time with Project Explore now, and I really have enjoyed it! I can actually appreciate many of the graphics and effects as they are - the topdown 3d styling of trees, rocks, etc is really cool! The game has really great sound design implemented throughout. My first play through I died pretty quickly. After that I buckled down and figured out some of the basics and did  much better. I plan to dive back into this game and spend a lot of time in it. And doing so will be worthwhile as the developer has been very active on pushing new content & features.So to close this, I was born in the 90's and grew up playing 2d games - so perhaps that is part of the reason that this game is so satisfying for me, but I would recommend Project Explore to any serious or casual gamer!Great game!

There are some flaws that I have come across which I believe will indeed in time be fixed and worked on. As everyone knows, this game is still in ALPHA and I would expect these type of things. Hearing as the developer does alot of updates to keep this game going strong and with a bit of feedbacks, this game will prosper. Overall I'd give it a 8.5/10, score will increase as game gets better and recommend sticking around to see what comes next as we can expect an awesome community, a driven developer and a great game.

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: Early Access, 90 updates in 10 months, devloper is open to criticism and suggestions, $5 base price can't go wrong, even better if you catch it on sale. Project Explore at first, sounds and looks like an exploration/walking simulator, but it's basically a top-down survival game similar to Don't Starve; there's a hunger/thirst meter, health and sanity which you have to maintain through items such as food and water, first-aid and entertainment (mainly from books). Crafting is very straightforward with an in-game recipe, which may make the survival aspect less challenging. The game is heavy on exploring and that's where Sanity comes to play because in order to continue exploring you need to stay sane.

								Run, gather, fight packs of wild animals, die. Try again. Gather, run, fight packs of wild animals. Man this is  a boring terrain. Die. Try again. Die again before you can pick up a rock. Hit the wolf, oh wait there are three more surrounding you. Dinner for the pack. Sorry. it got boring real fast. If you like plain jane atmosphere with lots of bears and wolves well this is the game for you.  May I suggest Rimworld? Yes Rimworld. This needs a lot of work. I don't understand the Very Positive raves about such an unfinished game. Oh well. Back to Rimworld.			"

								Hey all,         First time trying out the game and I can already tell that this game has potential to which it will become an even better game than what it already is. There are some flaws that I have come across which I believe will indeed in time be fixed and worked on. As everyone knows, this game is still in ALPHA and I would expect these type of things. Hearing as the developer does alot of updates to keep this game going strong and with a bit of feedbacks, this game will prosper. Overall I'd give it a 8.5/10, score will increase as game gets better and recommend sticking around to see what comes next as we can expect an awesome community, a driven developer and a great game.

								Don't Buy, Not Now and Not Later.Yes could be a handy little iso game, though luckily if your into top-down flash survival games checkout the free facebook/workdaygames games. There could be an awesome massive update somewhere down the track though until there is a concept of what the game is meant to be. All we'll probably get is a small random features from devs rather then actual gameplay issues.For example 1) fences don't join each other, ceilings don't prevent rain or need support to float in the air. 2) you have to shoot behind the target in order to hit object hit box. 3) items give + health, soft health limit 100, no limit to consumption. food is hard limited 100.See lets play here >

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: Early Access, 90 updates in 10 months, devloper is open to criticism and suggestions, $5 base price can't go wrong, even better if you catch it on sale. Project Explore at first, sounds and looks like an exploration/walking simulator, but it's basically a top-down survival game similar to Don't Starve; there's a hunger/thirst meter, health and sanity which you have to maintain through items such as food and water, first-aid and entertainment (mainly from books). Crafting is very straightforward with an in-game recipe, which may make the survival aspect less challenging. The game is heavy on exploring and that's where Sanity comes to play because in order to continue exploring you need to stay sane. While other survival games use Stamina or Temperature as means of survival, Project Explore uses Sanity, which I find interesting and hope to see more depth coming from it as it develops.--- 07 January, 2016 ---There's been massive updates and the game is slowly getting better, my first impression was a top-down Minecraft, but visually and technically it's turning into Don't Starve.

You go  loot, sacavenge, craft,  find lake, build house near it, grow some food, kill all mobs in your area and thats it.So for now its NOT WORTH BUYING if you want to play hours and hours in this, but if you want to try this out and too see how its becoming a better game, cuz now its only in Early Access you SHOULD BUY IT.My verdict about this game:1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play			"

								This game is neat. I don't have much time in it yet, but I've kept a close enough eye on it to know that the creator cares for his game and wants it to grow. Wants it to grow so much that he releases an update every day or every couple days.It's one of those games I look at and imagine the maker going ""I think I'd like to make a game."" and then they do it, and say ""Hey guys, I made this game! Want some? Look at all these plans I have."" and then he implements the plans to show that he is serious before adding more plans to the list. ""It's only a couple dollars guys, look at all this other stuff im adding.""Seabass, your doing great work. Keep doing great work, Id like to see where this goes.			"

								Project Explore is a must play for any crafting survivalist.The game places you in a randomly seeded world where you have to fight, scavenge, hunt, fish, and build to survive. With hunger being an ever-present problem, along with bleeding and temperature, this game submerses the player into an environment where you must weigh your decisions carefully and save often. I would recommend this game, even in the alpha stage its worth the buy and I can honestly say you will not be disappointed!			"

								--EARLY ACCESS REVIEW--In my opinion this is a really great game... Its kinda like rust but with a overhead view, and with the added awesome bonus where you don't need damn pillars to build a house (making a ton of those we're annoying in rust, took ages to get the wood to make a building just because of pillars) But seriously buy it while you have the chance of it being on sale and for as cheap as it is for as good of a game as it is... Yeah its in alpha but that just means the game has a lot more potential to be even a greater game... And the developer is a really nice guy and communicates with the community to make the game better for the community. And updates at least once a week is always nice, something new to find every week you play the game :DI rate it 8/10 but will most likely go up as the game progresses. There are things that need to be added in yet like Multiplayer. I do not regret buying this game AT ALL, so just try it out :D Maybe you'll like it :PAlso he streams on Twitch so check that out *wink, wink, nudge, nudge*http://www.twitch.tv/leagueofsebastian/profile "

								Game sounded promising, with a catchy trailer. But lo and behold, once you are thrust into the world, which consists of random patches of grass and sand, complete with random sandstorms on grassy patches. Animals who follow you relentless to kill you, with your not finding a weapon to fight back with unless you chance upon a random  building with random loot. While there is potential, I worry this might be abandonware. Until significant features are added, to where there is a point to playing, I cannot reccomend this.			"

								Since new updates my Opioin of the game has changed.... And i love it even more :)Alot of new items have been added and after seeing the new wavepoint system and armor all i can say is where are the weapons? With all this badass armor coming out you would think Surviors and more weapons are needed to match up to the amor so the player doesnt feel 100% secure and safe with armor on. And of course im going to bring back my mention of pets :). If you havent already goten rid of the idea then Please add pets as my player feels very lonely in house by himself.Ahhhh... Project Explore where to start. Me personally i love TDS games and making it survival was a good choice. Of course with every early access games there are a fair share of bugs. The bugs in the game do not make the game completely broken or unplayable. Well lets just get started with the review The Developer   The develper goes by the name of Seabass of steam or LegueOfSebastian on twitch. Sebass is in gamemaker constenly working and updating his game making him one of my favorite developers because unlike alot of them he has kept working on his project and i know finish it. He adds new content almost everyday aswell. He so far has kept his promise and i defenitly see this game getting finished and becoming really popular. He is very helpful and keeps his trello well updated he also when not working will help answer some question on GameMaker: Studio.Project Explore Project Explore is a game on trying to survive as long as possible dealing with hunger, health, and sanity. You can chop down trees to build a house or mine metal to make a gun and some tools. Animals are a big danger as they are powerful and can sometimes be hard to kill. There are alot of weapons even a referance to Half-Life. Like a more peaceful way to live? no worries!! In Project Explore you can go fishing to get food and you can basically live of the land in this game all the way. But sadly there is a down side. The Metal Axe as it stands is way to easy to get i had it before the stone axe. What I personally would love to see My ideas for the game are simple    More Animals and Fish   Pets (like a Panther, Bear, Wolf)   More Guns and Weapons (ShotGun, Rifle, a Sword of sorts and with pets maybe a way to control them to attack)   Different tools (Picaxe to mine rock, Drill to mine rock and cut trees, hoe to farm, Chainsaw to cut down trees)   More Ores to make more tools and better equipment    AI controlled sruvivors and camps to raid Closing Lines I say add in pets because during playing i sortof got lonley and wish i had a pet or friend that could help me through my journey on the landAll in all I give this game a 10/10 Maybe even add some of my ideas :]Keep up the great work Seabass and finish this game			"

But the game has potential. Developer is uploading regular fixes and updates and you can see this game develop. imo the game is not worth this amount of money (yet?)*Edit*The game is comming together quite nice! After recent updates and fixes, even a reply from the Dev, i enjoy exploring what happened and was pleasantly surprised. Auto save fixed and way more depth.

Early Access Review
								Early Access, a re-review 5/16Game has definitely polished up since it came out. When you first start a map, you're able to customize your character (even from above, you can see different hair styles and clothing color). Different biomes have been added, with temperature that goes with each environment, that does affect your survivability (too hot, you get thirsty; too cold, your hunger drops; too dark, you go insane), like your average survival game.What makes it different is the dedication that the developer is putting into his game. Yes, I am actually the other half of the studio, but I am not a part of the game except for the occasional input and celebratory things. I was encouraged to revisit the game, and I am glad that SeaBass was able to take input from the community and put it in the game, because it made quite an improvement. Also, your occasional references to pop culture, or a glimpse of the developer's back story, is reflected in the 50 and counting items that are being added into the game. What I really liked is the nice amount of wildlife on the map (or at least a realistic amount) and the ability to refill water bottles (California should really take that advice to heart).What I want to add as constructive feedback would be an easier way to control the game. Example, using a key, or left clicking on an item for it to move to the shortcuts or the crates (when applicable). It's more of a burden dragging everything around, and it's not efficient.I also found way too many skeletons, torches, and rock (item) spawns on the map. I don't know, there just seemed to be a lot of stuff, and without a place with crates/a backpack on hand, it can get out of control.Having died only on the fifth day to a dirty gang of creepy, blade-as-hands, no-goods, only makes me want to survive even longer. A game worth supporting and praising. Splendid job, SeaBass.----Old ReviewAn enjoyable survival game with a dedicated developer. It's constantly updated with the help of the growing community and improving every day. A game worth picking up. *thumbs up*			"

								WOW! This game is constantly upgrading to awesomeness. It's still very early, and has plenty of areas where you might want to see more, but the way I feel watching these guys work is that you'll be pleased. They are clearly intent on creating more then just a simple game, but a deep, engrossing and adaptable exploration game.So for the price right now? Totally worth the money, buy it, wait it out, watch it expand into awesomeness. Just my opinion at the moment. As always with early access, could things change? Sure, they could, but everything appears to be heading up and up.			"

								""Very Positive"" people say. Well guess again people. This early access game has a lot to go to be considered good. There are a lot of stuff not added which will take a long while to actually be in the game. Also why is the dev trying to make the game look like Dont Starve.You know its bad when the developer's game is so bad, they try to make it like Dont Starve. For all you people that have trouble reading.DO NOT BUY... yet			"

Early Access Review
								Project Explore shows promise, but it doesn't yet live up to expectations.  As an early access game, that's not unexpected.For now, this is an game that, if available at a low price, is certainly worth the purchase to kill a couple of hours here & there. There's a fair amount of land to discover & quite a bit to do (hunting, fishing, building) that's fun if done for a short amount of time.  Once you get into the groove & get what you need to easily survive (which can be done in a couple of game days after you get a feel for the mechanics), the magic wears off.  At the time of this review, there is nothing available to sustain the game & keep players playing long term.  With updates expected around the corner, this problem may soon resolve itself.There are some minor glitches, but all of the ones I've found have already been noted by other users & recognized by the developer.  None of the ones I have encountered have made the game frustrating or unplayable. Only time will tell if they are going to be fixed, but it does seem that, at the time of the review, the developer is actively working on improving the game.			"

Early Access Review
								I am normally a guy who loves these tiny little games that have so much potential. he was right when he said it isnt bug free or isnt finished but as of now there is the structure. i will give it a chance and i hope the game will become more than it is now bu as of now 7 dollars gets you a poorly made lost simulator with you having to hope you find everything you need. you start with nothing, have not goals or direction and are just left to roam, You get losts easy, mot things will kill you quickly, the attacking system is not the best, and it has very major bug. now you may ask why i give it the humbs up. now dont get me wrong this game has a ways to go but from what i see, and if all goes well, it will be a decently good game. its a common idea now with a new artstyle and a diffrent twist. Overall: i give it a 6/10 due to the lack of content as of now but i see much potential in the game. this can be major in these tiny games and this is one i am proud to own.			"

								good idea , simple little game with plenty of things to make . Only problem is you can't make anything untill you have an axe and you cant make an axe untill you get sticks , you need axe to get logs to make sticks . So unless you find an axe you can't do anything ...... Big problem . Come on Dev please sort this out . Hunger goes down far to fast and when hunger goes down so does health so you have to keep killing animals to get meat and this leaves no time to build or craft anything For the price it is worth buying , but just hope you find an axe and stay away from bears			"

WARNINGDO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU DONT WANT TO VOMITI tried to play this game for longer I really did but it just made me feel sick and gave me horrible eye strain.This game reminds me of something made for the gameboy, but only 4 billion times worse. The top down angle is horrible making everything impossible to see and the bright colours and horrible angle combined are enough to knock anyone sick. I would not recommend playing this game if you have just eaten your dinner, or if you really want to risk it have a bucket handy and close by.The Bad* The UI is so clunky, hard to navigate, unresponsive, messy and just downright horrible.* The angle leaves no perspective of depth, making you feel sick and struggling to understand what the hell anything is. * The bright colours mixed with the horrible top-down angle.* You cannot play this game for longer than 10-15 minutes at a time if you dont want to vomit.The Good?I legit could not find a single redeeming value about this game. The developer is nasty, the game is nasty 10/10 IGN would recommend you do not spend your hard earned cash on this trash. How the hell did this get through greenlight and mainitain postive reviews? I call foul play.			"

								This game has a lot of potencial.. And even that it´s only ALPHA It is a great game.. If I have to Mark this game from 0 to 10, I say 8.. So Graphicks: Although that it is a 2D game from the upper pespective, graphicks arevery good... They are not very pixelated how you may think. Shaders are good but, when you are at full graphicks and near a fire (Firepace) It is so blury that you are not able to see almost nothink... Otherwise I can´t complain only in 1 think.... Well....Saving Game. I hope that the developer will fix this because when you save a game and you exit it (doesn´t matter if you close just world or the hole game) you don´t have that save... Please fix it. So overal.Graphicks: 8/10 (fire and that stuf)Gameplay: 10/10Sound: 10/10Items: 8/10 (compas.. Doesn´t work.. you should add a bed I think)Loading and Saving: Well..... 2/10 (you know why..)And that´s all.. And sorry for mystakes I am Slovak so... :D			"
