												 For starters, this game obviously came out years ago, but does that bring the enjoyment level down? No, it does not! The game it self is not what I was expecting it to be, however like all games it has its upsides and downsides. Upsides: The animal selection is large enough for a zoo game, and on top of that, Wild creatures has extinct animals you can bring back including two dinosaurs, Velociraptor and Archaeopteryx. Another upside is that you can use a certain fences to make a tank using a water pump. Downsides: Like in all zoo games, the guests are as need as **** ( are real zoo guests this flippin' needy!). One thing that I found weird is that instead of placing animals, you place houses that are specific to a species of animal and then you can buy the animal that the house is specified for (what happens if I want to put tigers in an enclosure with a lion house?!). Overall this game is interesting enough if you love animals. Total score: 7/10			"

												This is by far my favorite game to play now. I was a HUGE fan of the Zoo Tycoon franchise, and being that it isn't available on Steam (and my laptop has no disk drive) I downloaded the original ""Wildlife Park"" to see how I like it. I LOVED IT, so I downloaded the ""Wild Creatures"" expansion. Having loved that so much as well, I play this game more than any others I've gotten from Steam. Bottom line: LOVE the original title and the ""Wild Creatures"" expansion more than I ever loved Zoo Tycoon and it's entire franchise.Yes, I would recommend this game to EVERYBODY that loved (or even just liked or enjoyed) Zoo Tycoon.
