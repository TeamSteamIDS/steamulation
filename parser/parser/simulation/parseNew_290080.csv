Early Access Review
								A lot of people have been asking my opinion on LiF- so I figured I'd go ahead and write a lengthy review on this game and lay down (what I think) you should consider if you're going to drop the $40 for this game in its current alpha state.First off, if you are someone who expects to be slaying dragons, fighting other people fully decked out in plate armor with a war horse and a golden lance within 30 minutes, and destorying them in 8 seconds with Mount and Blade style combat- do not even remotely consider this game.At the exact time of this review I have sunk about 7 hours into this game (and of course plan on playing much more) and have managed to JUST NOW build myself a small shack and obtain a little iron to POSSIBLY create into tools. Mind you this was done with the help of around 6-7 other people who were working in extreme cooperation with one another. Just to give you a little sense of how ""hardcore"" this game really is when it comes to progression. (I was also playing on a server with hardly any skill multiplier, there are servers where you can level things much faster and thus progress with greater speed if you're looking for a more solo experience) Now down to picking out the major aspects of the game people wish to know about:1. Combat: Being someone who loves the fighting aspects of games, I will admit that Life is Feudal's alpha combat is nothing to write home about. 3/4s of your swings WILL miss until you get the range of your weapon (which is different for each weapon) and once you've actually got the combat down you will still have difficulty hitting. It is /not/ Mount and Blade combat. Is it close? Yes- but it is not M&B. Trust me. However, there is only alpha and it will likely get MUCH better and I can certainly see a fantastic combat system coming out of this. All in all, the combat at the moment is basically an unpolished combat of what can make a great system. 6/102. Crafting: Crafting is definetly one of the stronger aspects of this game. It is rich and complex, certainly has massive potenial to be added onto. Even in its current state there is quite a lot to do. However I have been met with some pretty strange bugs that cause me to crash (which is totally to be expected in the alpha testing phase, but I am after all reviewing the alpha) and some recipes are implemented but do not even work, for example the bow and torch. Overall, crafting is going to be very good when it is refined and expanded on, and even in its current state it is very useable. 7/103. UI: I am bunching UI and Mechanics together due to the fact that there isn't much to talk about regarding them. The User interface is clearly in an early stage, but much like the crafting, very useable. There is a bit of a learning curve when you first get into the game (trying to figure out how the hell to do anything basically) but once you over come this, you should be able to experiment and figure out everything else on your own. Don't expect this game to spoon feed you, and honestly after 7 hours, I'm sure there is stuff that even I haven't figured out yet. 6/104. Skills and Mechanics: The skills system is still very much a work in progress, I'd say about 1/4(?) of the skills have still yet to be implemented. However, that doesn't detract from the complexity and potential that the skill system has. From plant gathering to cutting down trees, to using a sickle effectively as a weapon under ""milita service"", the skill system is impressive. One of the coolest in my opinion is the formation skills when in a unit, I'd write more about it but it is something easier looked up. As of right now I have only encountered one bug with the skills and that is when you pray it actually respawns you (for some odd reason). The skills system is definetly going to be something to enjoy once it is fully completed. 8/10Now my final thoughts on whether you should drop the $40 or not: As you can see in a lot of what I said, these systems will be great ""once they're complete"" and take that exactly how it's said. This is without a doubt an alpha, and if you can't get past the crashes, bugs, and imperfect systems- do not spend your money. If this was around... $20 I would say you should still give it a go, but this price tage is a bit steep. However- if you wish to support the development process and you can get past the grime thats covering the shine, you're going to enjoy the living hell out of this game and I would highly recommend it.Hopefully this helps some people make their decisions.

Early Access Review
								I absolutely love this game. I am on a non PVP server and we are usually close to full every evening. I was unsure about the game the first hour or so. I'm used to Rpg's where you wander around killing stuff to level up and craft when you get tired of leveling. This game is completely different. It's all about building and crafting. It'a about wandering around a beautiful country looking for the things you need to make food, tools, armor, houses, keeps, weapons...basically anything and everything.      On our server we have like three separate communities or villages. Since PVP isn't an option on this server, we are friendly to one another. On my second day of playing I had made a crapload of mortar and pestles so I shouted out that if anyone wanted some of them for free, just come to my village at the base of the smallest mountain in the northeast by the sea. (There are no roads yet, although they can be built with certain skills so we use landmarks like lakes and mountains to guide people to where we are). So some stranger shouts back asking me why don't I put my stuff in a chest and I respond that i don't have one or the skills to make one. So he yells back that he'll make me one and he lugs this huge chest on his back all the way to my village just to be neighborly! This is the kind of community I like to play in and the majority of the players on my server are like this! Then the guy sticks around a bit and gives me tips on crafting and makes me a blacksmith hammer when I ask him what skill is needed to make one.       The crafting is what makes this game fun for me. Gathering my materials and skilling up to make better items is simply a blast once you figure out the mechanics which aren't very hard. Right now, I'm enjoying making tools. Yesterday I tried out hunting. Low level hunting was fun as heck. You're too weak to kill big game, but the game makes it enjoyable in a very unique way for newbies. A noob hunter has a couple od fun skills One is a crafting option to make small animal snares and the other is called small animal tracking. When you activate tracking, an animal's footprints appear and you can see where he likes to travel. Follow his trail and place the snares you make out of materials along the way ( plant fiber, a tree branch and an apple) which are all easy to find, then come back in an hour or so and empty your traps. I got chickens and hares and I put them in a coop in my village and they laid eggs and had babies...totally awesome. You can also track aggressive animals once you learn to defend yourself. I've seen bears and wolves. There are no monsters yet and I'm okay with that...it feels real. Supposedly they will be added in the future. Bear in mind this is alpha.        There are PVP servers if that is your thing, but I can't comment on that aspect of the game because I don't like pvp.         If you choose non pvp, the game is about building a community. In my village everyone chats, they ask other for items and sometimes we trade stuff or even just give it away. Today a new person logged on and asked us how to get a house, so we told him to join our village and everyone helped to build him one. Since I was too low to actually help build, I helped gather wood. I felt good about it and it was fun to see everyone helping a complete stranger. I've played MMO's for many years and frankly outside of guilds, you meet so many rude obnoxious people in MMO's anymore but so far it hasn't been like that here.           I'm really excited. I found it difficult to even take time away from the game to write this post, but I wanted to get the word out. I've got big plans. I'm raising my healing skills and making my own plate mail so i can kill bears, and I'm learning to fish. I'm even going to build a keep which takes 15000x rocks and 4000 shaped stone among other things. It will take months and it will be so much fun to watch it grow into a fortress for me and my friends.       Let me be clear on one thing. if you're looking for action packed adventure, the non pvp server aspect of this game is NOT for you. This is laid back...serene music in the background, birds twittering in the trees, the sound of your neighbor chopping wood, a hike up the biggest mountain on the island to watch the sunset and get back home before the wolves come out. It's about meeting people who don't yell, ""I PWNED YOU!"", but instead say things like, ""Hey, we just killed a bear and we're cooking it up in our new village...everyone's invited!"" or ""Hey, I'm a prospector and I have a ton of copper...wanna trade me some of your logs for some of it?"" or ""Hi everyone...I'm new here...can anyone help me?"" and hearing 6 people shouting back for him to come join their village. There are a few bugs...this is alpha after all. In the morning, chicks are born, trees blossom, and everything updates and there's usually a few minutes lag. Once my targetting button wouldnt work and I logged out  and then back on and it solved that glitch. This is early alpha after all, so glitches happen, but so far nothing game breaking. What I really like is it doesn't feel like some madcap rush to endgame...like omg I have to level up to keep up with everyone. It's not like that at all. Even the lowliest noob can help on stuff because gathering is a HUGE part of this game.  It's slow paced, but entertaining as hell. There's such a satisfaction when you gain a skill where you can make a new tool or piece of furniture or armor and actually use it and see a big difference. And since each village is essnetially a guild with houses, there's sense of community, of being neighbors. It's not some strange guy ridng up on his horse, hurrying to unload the gear he got in a dungeon and racing off without a backward glance or a hello. It's about your neigbor looking over at you and saying, ""I feel like mining today. What are you going to do?"" I look off in the distance at some mountain and reply,"" I'm going to go over to that mountain over there and terraform the top so I can build me a little shack at the top with a view of the ocean on one side and this village on the other."" My neighbor looks at me and says, ""It's going to take you awhile to flatten the land on the top of that mountain. That's a lot of digging!"" I smile and reply, ""That's okay! I like the view and I've got lots of time!""      I love this game!More impressions! New impressions after a week. I'm so tired....last night I did not go to bed because I simply cannot quit playing. So much has happened. The lag comtinues to glitch the game at times and kicks  you occasionally but I'm willing to tolerate that due to early access...it's expected. My first server grew unstable in no small part due to my older computer so I've switched twice since then. A FANTASTIC experience both times! My first was another PVE server since I'm terrible at PVP and I met the most wonderful group 2 minutes into getting their and joined their village. Had a wonderful time helping them build and getting to know them. we decided to go for a village surrounded by castle walls and it was cool. Now here's the thing...a lot of these guys had experience by now like me and the town was already coming along great without me, so I decided to take up herbalism because none of them seemed to like the grind of this skill. They make this skill like a mini game. Evetry herb has three hidden qualities and there are 66 herbs. Your challenge is to find them (easy and quick), mix them with a mortar and pestle (Easy again), and finally try to match them up to find which ones share familiar traits (not so easy). Heres the thing...you're looking for one particualar item in these herbs...flux. You cannot mix two of the same with similar traits or it creates an item and your herb disappears. You don't want that to happen on 99% of the items...however, if you get two items with flux characteristics, you DEFINITELY want to mix them because this is the most needed item for			"

The following is a personal anecdote taken from my experiences playing on Role-Play Community: Life is Feudal (RPCLIF) server. In this community heavy RP is enforced and any event done otherwise is punishable.Day 1: I have finally made my way into the realm from a nearby beach, it has been a while since I have visited the Isle of Maldath. I gather berries and herbs and begin to train myself in the ways of the gatherer. Day 2: I have located a nearby settlement surrounded by tall oaks and green grasses known to the natives as Woodhurst. Upon signaling the guardsman at the towering iron front gate, to my surprise, I am greeted by an old friend of mine, Arnaas of Valencia. We reminisce for a moment and I am soon offered a position among their people as an herbalist in training. Of course I accept, and then am put on a trial period to prove my loyalty.Day 3: Whilst gathering in the nearby cattle-fields of Woodhurst I notice two men approaching the front gate of the town, one in what seemed to be a religious robe and the other in sturdy plate armour. I am urgent about greeting them, in hopes that I can make a few friends. The two outsiders reveal themselves to be ""Solith"" a priest of the Blood God and ""Korn,"" a fellow mercenary. They are spreading word that the southern faction known as Dominion has fallen and is being rebuilt by their cult. Once again, I am offered a position. Strucken by promises of gold and power... I am torn.Day 8: After days of training, I have begun to mix potions for Woodhurst as they have accepted me as their full time alchemist. I covertly keep in touch with Solith as I am still partially swayed by his tempting offers. I am introduced to the town bank as I am now added to the pay roll.Day 12: A raid has taken place on the nearby settlement of Mercia in which the pope of Woodhurst was slain by no other than Korn and Solith's Cult. General Felipo of the Woodhurst army immediately drafts me into their military as a recruit and I undergo extreme combat training. My specialty being Pole-Axes and Scale Armour. Day 20: Serving for Woodhurst has now become grueling work with little pay. One night at my post, I decide to leave the town in search of Solith's lair, hoping that his offer still stands. I am greeted by their cult and am offered training and safe haven if I leave Woodhurst forever. I state that I must go back to fetch my items. As I am leaving, a squadron of Woodhurst soldiers stops  and sees me conversing with the cult. I am immediately interrogated and claim to be seeking revenge for our pope. General Felipo decides to take matters into his own hands and challenges Solith's mercenary, Korn to a duel. Korn is decapitated as I make an effort to ride back to Woodhurst.Day 30: My quarters have been under lockdown and I have been suspended for suspicion of treason. One night I successfully subdue my guard and make my way into the inner town square. I make my way for the bank. The blackmith's, the queen's, carpenter's, everyones payroll now mine. I have stolen a horse and made my way back to Solith's lair. I am now wanted.Day 31: The combined forces of Woodhurst and her allies have surrounded Solith's Lair and are demanding that I be handed over for execution. We wait them out after exchanging volleys of spears etc.Day 34: The heat has cooled off and I leave the lair in search of a plot of land to buy for my own, one that is away from all this conflict. As I approach a nearby village, I make my way into the town inn and have a long conversation with the bartender. A long enough conversation in order for their messenger to send word to Woodhurst of my location. I hear a farmiliar voice call my name. As I turn, I immediately draw my weapon. Then as I see all the other farmiliar faces start appearing, I dash for my life. I make it just in time to grab my horse and ride all the way across the island evading every single horse archer and lanceman they sent after me. I am now forever an outcast among these lands.  Conclusion:I'm going to let you all in on a little secret about this game.  Like many others of its kind, this game and its famous hard-core RPG elements, are very closely tied to the servers you play on. This is because to become a ""Grandmaster Hunter"" or even a ""Famous Axe-Man"" means close to nothing unless you have a community that depends on you. So what I'm trying to say is, don't jump into this game by yourself or even with a few friends on a private server because most of you will not get your money's worth. You don't want yourself to end up like everyone else in the negative reviews section who got sick of digging holes and grinding for levels. Instead, find a meaningful server. One that cherishes heavy RP, constant PVP, or even both. That being said, I highly recommend RPCLIF as your server of choice for the adventures to come.			"

												I have played this game a lot. I know almost everything about it, currently. I have built everything that there is to build, been a king, a farmer, a warrior...  so when I write a review, know that it is quite balanced. I am no fan boi, and will let you know all the pro's and cons of this game.Pros. 1. You can tailor your characters skills to match what you wish to do in the game. Depending on the server skill cap, it can mean you can ONLY be a farmer and a bowman, or a smith and a swordsman, to being able to do everything.  Pick the server that best represents what you want. RP, pvp, rp/pvp, high skill cap (recommended for new players) or low skill cap.2. crafting system requires a lot of steps. You want to build a small house? Alright the you either have to have a supply of trees nearby, or have forestry to plant saplings and wait half a week in real life for trees to grow enough to harvest. Then once you get the timber, you or a friend better have herbalism to get enough flux to make steel for the locks and mortar needed for doors. Then you better know enough materials prep to make glass for windows... which requires carpentry as do the doors. Oh, and smithing to make the locks... while you make clay tiles. So, you need 1. forestry. 2. logging. 3 carpentry. 4. smithing. 5. materials prep. 6 gathering. 7 herbalism... just to make the smallest house in game.  On a low skill cap server, this will take the combined efforts of 3-4 people. Now imagine what a castle takes.3. harvesting is indepth. Need leather? Go hunt, make coops to harvest hares, and barns for animals... oh you need to actually trap those animals, or tame them.  Food is grown, and harvested... then a cook is needed ot make it into actual food. All raw resources need to be manufactured into goods.4. giant battles. I have participated in a 64 man judgement day battle. Took hours of non stop fighting, with trebuchets flinging rocks, bombs and arrows everywhere, people murdering eachother and sometimes friends on accident. 5. Small battles. Nothing is more intense than a 2-3 man vs 2-3 man fight, where every person is needed to hold their own to win. Takes hours and hours of training to get decent, and I mean just decent, at pvp6. You literally create your own town from nothing. You scoop every bit of dirt, plant every tree, move the world to create a settlement that you can be proud of. You can make a hovel in a swamp, or a giant fortress in the mountains, it all depends on the time you invest.7. community and roleplaying can be a blast. Politics, intrigue, back biting... all fun.Cons.1. server wipes. put 200 hours into your place, and its gone, instantly, start from scratch. 2. lazy or no gms. LEaves you at the mercy of the griefers if the server you choose doesnt have active gms.3. SLOW DEVELOPMENT. And I mean SLOW. I have played for quite some time now... the ONLY thing added to the game since I have played (I played in beta) was advanced weather. That's it. Most people dont even use it as it can lag you. Oh and the dx11 graphic upgrade... which didnt actually add anything to the game. They have been promising horse drawn carts for MONTHS.4. broken features/bugs will drive you crazy. Wait till you die 20 times in a row, losing a ton of skill points that takes  hours to get because of a bug. You can't play the game by yourself and expect to win. The fun is in groups. Dont buy this game if you dont want to join a group.			"

Spent 4 hours digging a hole to find ore, some guy came along and hit me over the head with a shovel and beat me to death then built a wheel barrow to haul away my ore.

								I really love what this game represents. Real feudal life. Hard, unkind, and taking effort to eke out a living. You get to experience struggle. But then, that's where the dream goes horribly wrong. I understand that they had to make concessions with the interface becaue they wanted to keep the servers from getting loaded with crap on the ground and have it crash. But the methods they came up with to deal with that aspect are painful to work around. Please note that *my friend and I played* this game with the server set on default settings. I wasn't solo.Let's go from the experience of making a house. The first little hut that you can make at the begining. So how would you make a house/hut in real life? Well, first you'd get some tools. Then you'd use the tools to gather the resources. Then you'd use the same tools or other tools to refine said resources. Then finally you'd assemble said refined resources in some fashion to construct the final product. Also I should include the reality of dealing with the terrain by preparing it. This is both an acceptable convention and a logical one. However, the developers of LiF:YO have decided that they wanted to do it their way.The LiF:YO way. First you start off by gathering the tool components. I'm with them at this point. You grab some branches, flint, and plant fiber and away you go with your tools. But here's where it gets convoluted. You don't now get to walk up to a tree, small or otherwise, and start smacking it. You have to ""know"" how to cut this tree down. So start learning. So grab some branches off a tree and other things to learn. Ok, you now know how to cut the tree down, but not all trees, because an axe on hardwood works differently than on softwood. Ok, fair enough, there's something there I won't argue with. But now I want to refine the wood into the construction materials. I have the tools, but again, I don't know how to cut a log into planks or construction posts. So to learn this, I pull more branches off trees and grab saplings and peel bark and cut down more trees. So finally I know how to make a log and planks and I get the materials I need to make the house. So I can make the hut right? Wrong. Now I need to go dig a hole in the ground, over and over and over... Why, you ask? Because I need to learn how to construct a house. The skill required to construct this house is called Construction Material Preparation and you need it to a pretty high level. So appearently digging a hole in the ground and dropping the dirt over and over again teach you something about building a hut. But the digging part is only for the prerequisite skill. Once that is high enough, you start digging rocks. But this does not get you the skill you need directly. You must ""refine"" this rock into smooth stone to learn the art of building. Eventually you finally get the skills required to build said hut and can relax with a Mojito on the porch looking into the forest you just razed to build it.My other complaint is that what do you do with all the rock and stone and wood that you didn't use up in this endeavor? You can't put it in storage, because that would require nails and stuff that requires iron ore that requires... Ok, I could go on, but the point is, this game requires you to do things that make absolutely no sense to level up without connections to other things that make sense. One last thing. I can respect the fact they don't want a pile of dirt to fit inside a sack that you drop on the ground as your only means of storage early game. But they already broke that convention with the planks and smooth stone and trees that you can stuff in the sack unrealistically. So make up your mind. You can't have it both ways. It's annoying as hell to have to walk away from your work just to dump dirt and rock on the ground while the capenter has filled his sack to the brim with a forest of goodies. Which by the way, if I wanted to give my buddy a rock to make a cooking pot, it can't happen early game. He has to dig his own rock, which also takes grinding a skill.I should further note that the majority of people currently enjoying this game are bypassing this entire process by using Admin commands. Doing things like creating resource piles of infinite resources because the mining is still broken. This hardly makes the game as epic and good as they are letting on. If you aren't willing to play the game the way it was meant to be played, at least have the decency to note that in a review. Also, if you are bypassing all the ""broken"" content with changed server settings. What does that really say about this game?TL:DR I feel like in the end, if I play this game I feel I'd make a better use of my time making an actual hut in my backyard out of the same material this game uses in far less time. I also wouldn't have to learn how to swing an axe for each type of tree I want to cut down. I'd like to know how this character made it to adulthood not knowing how to dig holes and catch food. If this is the direction they want to go for the final product, there's no way I can say ""Well done."" Please rethink the skill tree and material aquisition aspect of this game and I will revisit your fine work. But untill then, I'll be in my backyard finishing my castle.			"

								There are some things about LiF that are really neat: the crafting, the graphics. Building your own medieval town is really such a wonderful idea and I was eyeing this game for ages.But as a single player (and this game is being marketed for single players as well as multiple), this game has been nothing but a disappointment.- For solo players, the grind is really the only thing there is. There's no danger and no purpose really to play: any wildlife that may attack you is easily avoidable. There are no other mobs. I had read before purchase of intentions to create quests and mobs, but it seems that those ideas have been abandoned in favour of keeping LiF:YO as a game that relies entirely on PvP for non-crafting content.- The grind is real. It took me over thirty RL hours to flatten the land and collect the mats I needed to build a small shack. This was after tweaking settings so I could have a chance in hell of creating anything on my own. As much as I love crafting, it's going to take absurd amount of time -- hundreds and hundreds of hours -- to build anything. But with no danger present in the world, there's no purpose to build other than aesthetics.- Some of the cool features in the LiF video are -only available for the MMO-. This is not the MMO. There are no crafting games here. The island you get is small and not likely to get bigger. No quests planned. The only thing in the world is you. And the tedious grind of creation.- Speaking of the MMO, that's where the devs are focused. Buying LiF: YO isn't giving you a version of the MMO: it's giving you the redheaded stepchild of the family. It's sickly, underdeveloped, and simply not getting any of the attention that they are lavishing on its brother. Reading the official forums makes it clear that this isn't likely to change. (Seriously. Go look at the list about the differences between YO and the MMO. You may find that the feature you're purchasing this for doesn't exist in the YO version.)Don't get me wrong. I really want to like this game. I'll keep my eyes on it and see if maybe the devs have a change of heart about the PVP-only content. But LiF is too much effort for very little pay off. Even if you are a solo player -- especially, even -- I'd highly suggest you wait for the MMO when it comes out.If it comes out.			"

												As of writing this one week after its ""commercial release"" I would say that this game is not currently worth the full price they are asking for it simply because it should never have been ""released"" as it is. I waited until they announced it was being released as I want to be able to play the game rather than constantly reporting bugs, however this game is nowhere near in a releasable state. Frankly it is still an Alpha game and every single play session I have entered into leads to yet more bugs and issues that quite frankly leave me frsutrated and enfuriated. Saxxon, the companies modrator on the steam forums, replies to complaints in snarkiness and with sarcasm and constantly compares this ""release"" to that of Fallout 4 because ""that game has bugs too!"" when the fact is that Fallout 4 does have bugs but is still more than playable with minimal stress or concerns whereas I am unable to get through 20 mins of Life is feudal without finding something else which is either broken or was simply half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in development. This game's ""release"" in no way compare's to Fallout 4, and for that matter I wouldn't compare it to Arkham Knight either which in istelf had a nightmare launch. Frankly, the release of this game is by far the worse PC release I have ever been a part of and what really pains me about that is that the concept of the game in itself is a very good one. Frankly I am disgusted that the company went straight from Alpha state into ""release"" completely bypassing the bug detecting beta phase and that they then have the ignorance to have someone like Saxxon treat new players concerns with derision because ""well it's not that bad"". They made a business decision to say that this game was finished and releasable and so with that there comes higher expectations as to the actual standard of the game and quality of the gameplay. At the moment this game fails on both fronts simply due to constantly encountering game-breaking bugs when trying to do the most basic of tasks. Do not be fooled into thinking that this game is as polished as other games as it really is not, and even now you are paying to participate in an Alpha even if they have removed that from the description. Be prepared to encounter lots of graphical and gameplay issues and also be prepared to submit a lot of bug reports. The real sad thing is that most of the bugs I (and my girlfriend) have encountered are things that should have been fixed in early alpha stages and so it disheartens me a lot to think that the developer now believes the game is adequate for release. It points to the fact that either the Developer is not actually taking note of issues and fixing them, or that the majority of players who particpated in the original Alpha didnt actually start over from scratch and build things for themselves and instead joined ready built servers. I have read a lot of forum posts from players who quite clearly just joined a pre-existing server where things were already built and so they skipped the majority of the grass routes ""find this and build this"" content early on. There really isn't any other explanation for why some of these bugs are still in the game at release. There is also a hell of a lot of mis-information on the internet about the actual workings of the game. The Life is Feudal Wiki being one of the main sources as it seems to be rediculously out of date when you try and look things up. This leads you to look for things that it says you need only to later find that you actually don't and that the process has now changed or become more complicated in some fashion. This is very concenring too considering that the company believes that the game was releaseable and yet they can't even be bothered to update their online information source when they make major changes to the game. I am extremely frustrated and dissapointed by this game simply because the concept in itself is great. I WANT to like this game and I have been forcing myself to play it and to fight through bug after bug to submit the reports to hopefully get them eventually fixed. The problem is that I simply can not morally support a company who force out a turd and then try and tell you that it is chocolate and that it tastes good because someone else's tastes worse. I have read a lot of forum posts in the last week and Saxxon's demeanor has led me to write this honest review. When a company charges people to play an Alpha version of a game, they damn sure need to listen to the feedback they are given and they need to listen to it with a smile as far as I am concerned. We are playing it more to help at this point than for any real enjoyment of our own and so when you read someone dismissing legitimate concerns simply because they can't be bothered to face the reality, it really frustrates me. Right now in it's current state I do not recommend this game at it's full listing price. If you see it at 50-60% off again (as it was on its launch week) then by all means buy it but do not expect to play it every day unless you are mentally prepared to encounter a lot of bugs. This game is not worth the full price which is a real shame. I do have hope that eventually they will get the game in a good and playable condition but I am not expecting that to be anytime sooner than 6 months or so from now, maybe even longer. This leaves me very dissapointed that they have considered ""releasing"" the game as they have. I will edit this review as and when issues become fixed and the game becomes playable and enjoyable but for now I would say save your money and wait for a sale. I still have hope that this game has a good future, but right now that future seems far off and my hope is not as high as it once was. EDIT 1:- Well my initial review was written at approx the 40 hours of game time mark, and now since I have doubled that and am at approx 85 hours, I figured i'd update my review to show if anything has changed. Sadly, It hasn't. The more I play the more I see issues which should have been fixed months ago. The in game systems such as Herbalism or Animal Taming are rediculously bloated and make the game a tedious grind more so than any other game I have played, and to make matters worse because the developers have relied heavily on Random Number Generators for everything in game it actually leads players to argue at how easy/hard things are to complete. What people forget is that because the game randomly assigns all recipes to you in something like Herbology, what works for you will not work for anyone else and so if you find it easy it is because the game has made it so the most common herbs are the important ones where as for everyone else the important herbs are the most rare. There is no definitive ""the game is easy or hard because"" simply because the RNG decides that every time you click create character. The RNG's seem to be everywhere too, such as in taming an animal. I have had one boar that would tame after 5 apples, but then another takes over 50. When you are playing the game as a single or co-op player that is a ton of resources to lose just for a single animal, but the problem is that you have no idea how many you will use until you have used them. Animal taming has many other flaws too such as the idea that you have to chase the animal until it tires itself out which again seems to rely on an RNG as to how long you will have to chase it for. Just today myself and my girlfriend had to chase a horse from dusk one day until the following morning in game and at no point did the horse tire out. It just ran and ran and never stopped. Another major issue is the fact that the animals can run straight through anything that would stop you, so they will literally pass through a tree trunk, stone wall or garden fence whilst you have to run around them. For a game that is supposed to be realistic, more and more I see issues that are simply unrealistic.More notes can be found in comments section			"

												you are not paying for the devlopment of this game.insted they are using the money made from this to create an MMO that will be pay to play based on the gameplay from this.basicly you are testing and ironing out bugs so the MMO will be launched near perfect with little or no cost to the devlopers, those that have pointed this out on the companys forums have been deleted.as far as this ""game"" goes, it remains to be known what will happen at the launch of the MMO (btw you get 1 free chr for buying this, thats right, only 1!) but my guess is this will be pulled.this is not a direct flame at the compnany involved, but i wish i had known this before buying.guess i should have reserched it first.

Early Access Review
 M&B, Chivalry, War of the Roses/Vikings players - READ THIS FIRST I loved this game, and i can honestly say i got my moneys worth. It has a fleshed out crafting/skill system and on that side of things, it's going in the right direction. But i bought this game and played 600+ hours because i read their website Game Info under   LiF is Like... [lifeisfeudal.com] which STATES:  ""LiF is... like Mount&Blade Series in terms of melee, ranged and mounted targetless physics based combat"" So I've spent a lot of time in this game waiting for the combat to be polished/worked on to actually even have a proper parry/blocking system like they promised. However, after an official reply from the moderators a couple of days ago in the official forums to outcries of people wanting a parry system to be implemented, this is what was stated by the moderator: ""2. We want to go our own way. We want to WEAKEN player reaction and player ping component, by removing directional parrying."" So basically, if you're a big M&B fan, or even Chivalry/WotR/WotV - you will cringe at the combat in this game like i did. It is only 60% complete which is fine, but their intention is to let this game be a slash-fest using combo's and the first person to lose all their health dies. Does that sound like M&B to you? They have no intention of ever allowing ""skilled twitch fighting"" to be a part of this game because, and again i quote  ""we want to do something new, not just blindly copy some cookie cutting mechanics that some of players got used to and trying to push"" Well i wish they had said that on their website instead of misleading the public. So this game gets a ""no"" from me.			"

Early Access Review
								Life is indeed Feudal, but unfortunately this game is futile.At the time of purchase, this game was advertised as Life is Feudal, then they made a hard right turn and shut down their original servers used for testing the MMO of this game and repurposed it for ""Your Own"", a small 3kmx3km island that resembles RUST only that it is set to a medieval time scale. The game promised group oriented combat and large group vs large group sieges to claim land and castles of such grand scale that it truly did blow everything else out of the water, including the Persistent World mod for Mount and Blade.After the game's EA release here on steam it was clear that they were completely derailing from their original intent of the MMO, and sought to make some extra cash. That's wonderful and all, but the simple fact that they openly said, "" We're looking to fund LiF:MMO with all the money we earn from LiF:YO..."" makes this game dangle ever so slightly over the toilet that snaps at it with hungry jaws.The marketing idea is flawed, fine, maybe the game is good enough to overcompensate.Let's look at some of the keystones for the game:Built with Torque 3D ( HEAVILY modified)- While this engine looks decent enough, it's not even capable of handing a 16 player server with minimal terraforming, the rigging is so clunky that most of the hit boxes actually twist with the character's movement, which translates into mangled hitboxes that are impossible to land hits on when you can clearly see the head of your hammer or the blade of your sword going through the body of the other player.Bi Weekly Updates- While the updates seem frequent enough, the content that is updated is more of a ""hotfix"" nature and not an actual Update to the game or its content.Developer presence- The presence of the Devs is definetly felt, they seem to be making a good bit of appearances on the forums both in Steam and in their own bug tracker. This could be both bad and good, as the more time they spent scrolling through the forums.. the less time they spent fixing the heavily modified game engine that requires a lot of love due to the fact that the engine is not designed for such a game, even with modding... it's limitations are clearly visible.Terraforming- The trailer made it look sweet right? Well... unless you dig a tunnel in a straight line then you need to expect gapping holes in the world that will cause you to fall beneath the playerworld and into a vast underground sea. The other side of terraforming, which doesn't involve mining, is almost a death sentence to the server. Get a group of friends to terraform your lands so you can properly build your kingdom and you'll increase the time it takes to load into a server by 10-30 minutes. The more you change, the longer it takes for the server to give you the files as it seems to be replacing ALL the local files with modded files from the server.Building- You can't do it alone unless you crank up the skill cap and become the God of All Skills. The only way to enjoy the game is to do so with atleast 3+ friends on a server that has skillcap/harvesting/growthtime all cranked up, and even then it will take days to complete small projects.Online play- I can only consider this an option if I'm part of a private server, as the game does little to nothing to stop griefing. Between folks digging unrepairable tunnels throughout your village, to people deconstructing your homes and putting unremoveable campfires in their wake. This game's Troll factor reaches that of RUST, minus the hacking... they did a good job of preventing that by keeping ALL files server sided.Servers- So, this is the fun part. Even a high end server can barely run this game without hourly spikes of lag that have been dubbed, "" Morning lag"" due to the obsurb amount of trees and plant growth that all require 2-4 calls to the database before updating. Each time you change a value, the client requests information from the database and the database requests information from the client... multiple times for the same change.Inventory- If you have OCD, step away. The inventory bags are nothing more than visual vomit. You COULD take an hour to organize the herbalist bag of yours... but your friend will still see visual vomit when he opens it, due to all inventory placement being clientsided.There are countless other issues that arise when you talk about the keystone features of the game, and I understand it's an embryotic alpha, damn near a tech demo, BUT.... the icing on this wonderful cake is the fact that the game doesn't properly used your video drivers as NONE of the video display adapter profiles are implemented into the game yet... want some more sweetness? a 16gb rig still gets  ""Out of Memory"" errors from playing the game for less than 5 minutes.Last but not least, the bug tracker for this game is a mile and a half long, and seems to be at a stand still.Overall, 2/10 but 7/10 when played with friends.Would not recommend.This is my first review, enjoy.

								This game is very time consuming.  I thought I would attempt to play this 'Space Engineers/Minecraft' style and build for fun.   I was not successful.  After 16 Hours, I had managed to build some barrels...  This game is so realistic that one cannot master all the crafting abilities, so you will need friends to work together in order to assign jobs and delegate work.  I.e. Woodsman, miner, carpenter, farmer, and so-on.  I think this game could be great with the right group of friends alas, most of mine are d-bags and aren't into sandbox/crafting games.			"

												The early access version went through a lot of ups and downs, but it was pretty solid. Obvious issues like infinity piles/tunneling and some getting stuck on terrain/etc but generally speaking it was a 'good' game.Then something odd happened I've never seen an EA game do before... They released a different game than what we have been testing/playing these last few years. I don't get it, you have us test this game for early access so you can work out the bugs/etc. But on launch day you change dozens and dozens of things that basically no one has tested. Why would you do this... The current version is so incredibly broken with bugs and glitches dedicated servers won't even run in a stable fashion. For whatever reason the devs had a 2nd version of the game they were developing on the side and released that instead of the game we've all been playing this entire time. What happened??			"

								I brought this game about two days ago, I thought I'd give a day prior before playing to get a fresh start. I started by spawning near a lake, I found a person fishing by the lake fishing, I asked him whether I could help, so he got food and I started making tools and gathering some logs to cut. 2 days later we now have a small village with 10 or so people contributing in different professions, we have armour and weapons on the way, a general, mayor and we still have so much more to do. This game is honestly amazing, you could see it at a first person age of empires from the villager’s perspective? Or even a Minecraft / mount and blade sandbox. Honestly, it's worth the buy the alpha is steady & this game is proving more and more amazing for the future. "

												**********************EditAfter the developer response i thought i'd give the game another run through. I tried to keep an open mind, especially (and surprisingly) now the game has left Early Access; and visually i thought it was much better. However - after spending 15 minutes fine tuning myself in the updated character creator while joining a server, i received the message ""you cannot use this name"". This happened twice, until i went with the default character with the name ""ILBAsdbasd askdjsjjs"" of which the game was much happier to allow.Anyway; I walked around, there were several frame rate drops that were temporary but nothing bad. A lot of effort has indeed been put into the aesthetic with a much more streamlined UI.I managed to squeeze in another 5 minutes before: ""Life is Feudal encountered an error and needs to close down""My breif edit and response to Saxxon is as follows.I was highly surprised before even starting the game that you made the decision to leave Early Access. The game runs smoother, i did notice.. However i was able to play even LESS of your game than i was back in June. Regarding the comment about my issues being with the servers and ""not the game itself"".I can't understand how that salvages anything. The game is only accessible through these servers, especially for new players. However you are correct and many of the issues i originally encountered have been fixed. But if i bought this game now, in ""release version"" and was unable to play due to the crash i wouldn't really give a flying **** about mining a tunnel.************************************Original Review:After spending nearly 40 hours trying to get myself started on this game (over the course of 2015) i've just had to give up!Here's one example. To build a warehouse to store anything, you need a ton of metal ingots. To get ingots, you need to mine. However, after joining many servers hoping to find a stable playing environment (some servers don't load, others you get kicked for not speaking their native language) i was banned for simply mining. Turns out mining for metal causes lag for the rest of the server, who knew? So after finally finding another stable server, speaking my native language, i asked what the 'work-around' was for gathering metal. The response was ""An admin needs to build an 'infinite pile' for you"". However, the admin of this server was sick and wouldn't be on for a month, poor guy. You won't be able to continue with your mining skill progression either, unless an admin cheats this for you.Eventually, i got my ""infinite pile"" of resources and my mining skill was boosted for me. At this point, i felt like i had cheated the game. The last few hours of my time with Life is Feudal felt cheap, cheesed.. And upon rejoining the server after a little over a day, everything i'd built was on fire. This was due to the decay system that's been introduced to remove trash. I had spent hours trying to build my house and a warehouse, which was now defined by the game as 'trash'. All in all, if you are very lucky and find a stable server and don't mind cheating the game for resources, then you'll probably enjoy it. Just be aware about inviting a friend to purchase the game too, as they might not even be able to join the same servers as you.For me, i won't be revisiting Life is Feudal until these game breaking flaws are resolved. ----------------On a side note ""This Early Access game is not complete and [may or may not change further]""Shouldn't this be illegal? I mean, everyone knows early access is a big cash cow for most devs, as well as Steam.. Yet a good analogy would be to pay for a 3 course meal at a restaurant, sit down & receive your starter but nothing else.Maybe i'm just hungry.			"

												I began my life as a simple peasant with no particular skill. I woke up on the shore of an island and soon found my place in the world with a small tribe that will one day be called the Southern Veil. We become allies with the neighboring town of the Sweetcottons before we are even able to erect a palisade wall. Soon after we gain these close allies we are rode upon by members of a place called Killian's Keep. They tell us that we must pay them a tax of straw. We refuse and militarize ourselves. Not soon after the taxes are imposed we erect a wall around our small settlement. I become the town blacksmith and I am known as one of the most skilled blacksmiths of the land. We then begin construction of a wooden keep surrounded by stone walls. Once these walls are complete we are invaded by the Huns. They used our wooden walls as cover from the arrows fired from our stone walls and soon created a ladder over our wall and slaughtered us. This was not the end.We grew larger, gained another close ally known as Ciderwood, and began to raid them back. We first struck Killian's Keep, coming in through a weak point in their wall and killing masses of them, then we come back again and again and we successfully slaughter them every time. Every time we raid the Huns they are never home so we wait and slaughter them every time they attack us or one of our allies. Now we are a huge militarized force with all of our allies only a moment's notice away from aiding us in combat, and we are the same for them. . . I began as a peasant and am now a warrior.

								I do not recommend the game, it's been many months and the development of the game is practically non-existent.Their rate of progression is laughable, which is probably cause of their focus on the MMO version (probably will end in tears). The game could be nice eventually but that won't happen in years.I would advice looking els where for your doze of medieval sandbox gaming.Game development is very long process, but this game has barely improved within a year. The community fixed lot of the optimization problems within days (or maybe even hours), when game was released for early-access. (Yet it took months for devs to integrate community solved fixes in to the game)			"

												Life is Feudal is a complex sandbox box, with a very open world. For those of you that remember it, it's VERY akin to the old Star Wars Galaxies (pre NGE)Pro's:-Complex Crafting system.-Fantastic system to socialize, as it is impossible to pick up every skill-Complex skil system that allows you to try new things, grow into new skills, and forget them if you don't like them.-Fantastic challenge rating for skills: Easy to pick up, time consuming to master. You can grow, loot, and craft high quality materials.-Great graphics. Really nice visuals on higher settings.-Terraforming: Push over minecraft, you can literally level landscapes, dig siege tunnels, and build ramps. Or just flatten terrain so you can build a city!-City building: Akin to SWG, you can drop down pre-generated structures, tools, build roads, claim ownership.-Nothing is worth doing that doesn't take time to do: This whole game takes time. It's not a fast paced, get your guns in a day and rule the world. BUT... it is fantastic, and well conceptually well designed.Pro&Con:-This is an MMO Sandbox. It is what you, and others make out of it. If you want to be a trader or bar keep, you can actually craft resources, make food, sell high quality foods, trade for better resources, and even pray for absolution from your sins. However, for every peaceful choice you make, someone out there will want to be a rampaging psychopath that will run into your shop and wreak everything...Cons:-Right-click-simulator: The game is fantastically in-deptch, but in order to make it EASY to manage, it uses a right-click system. Where you end up openning that menu... A LOT.-It doesn't like it when you alt+tab. Seems to work better on windows 10.TLDR:This game is a fantastic open world complex to the likes of SWG Original Release. It's got a deep crafting system and really encourages social play. So build your character, find new people, and start carving up your plot of land! Because this IS the sandbox game you've been looking for!			"

								Life Is Feudal - A lot of people buy this game with bad expectations.  They play games like ARK, DayZ, 7 days to die and Minecraft, and expect a 'medieval survival/builder sandbox' game to be comparable.  What they don't realize, is that they're idiots.Recent review I read:  ""I logged in for 2 minutes, saw the game sucks and got refunded"".This is the mindset for why this game has mixed reviews, NOT because the game deserves mixed reviews.Life is Feudal is a 'realistic' survival builder, which is something these kids don't understand, because none of their games are realistic.  To them, realism is finding a brand new machine gun in a box, or building a base in 30 minutes, or punching a dinosaur unconscious so they can tame it with berries, and that my friends is the grotesque standard these dumb kids are comparing this game to.  Don't listen.This game is it's own genre, and it can't be compared to anything else.  Everything takes time in this game.  It will take you days to build your first house, and weeks to build a settlement.  And THAT is why this game has the GREATEST community I have ever seen in an online game.  This game is all about teamwork... not the solo game experience.And just so people know what this game is being developed for... this version of the game is the groundwork for an MMO version, where a much larger world will be occupied by thousands of players.  This is by far the greatest survival/builder game I have ever played, with the best community I've ever played with.  Thank you 'Life is Feudal' developement team for creating a game for adults that scares off those with attention deficits.			"

Early Access Review
								The developers are seeming quite shady. Deleting ANY forum thread on steam that remotely mentions their overpriced early release game, Or, The fact that they delete any thread that draws attention to a negative point about the game should be a red flag.Notice the 10/10 review from HotRise here on metacritic?Go check out the life is feudal website and notice how similar their 'selling points' are.HotRise's review has no ACTUAL cons. This is a typical market tactic. Look constructive and modest, yet, have no ACTUAL downside.The developers aren't well known. And while this DOES NOT mean they shouldn't be trusted, it DOES mean to be careful.How do we do this?By monitoring their ""First impression practises""I have seen a video from AffectiveGamers/DecryptedGaming on steam that he did himself that sums them up very well if you want to see this video click the link http://encryptgames.wordpress.com/2014/09/22/too-much-power-for-steam-developers/What are they?-Overpriced $40 early-release (very unfinished) game. (When compared to Rust and DayZ both having big names behind them, lots of trust, and a less expensive early release product)-Lack of professionalism Re: not being able to take consumer criticism, and instead deleting any sign of it. (This is propaganda)-The developers don't seem to have a decent grasp on marketing and sales.And think about this.It is a scary thought that a bunch of people who may or may not be able to create a game will pull out random figures of ""we need $200,000 for making the game"" without being able to tell you where the money will be spent and why.A bunch of people who don't understand market trends and values and will charge twice what other more well-established companies charge for an Early Release game without understanding that as an upstart company, where there has been no established trust, that they need to charge less to sell more.And this will potentially create more revenue, but, DEFINITELY generate a larger ""copies sold"" statistic. Which in of itself, creates more trusted statistics for further backing/sponsorship/sales.This game may be great. But right now, the developers seem to be a bunch of guys who haven't much idea about business.Maybe they can design a game. But it takes more than that to be successful.Too scared to pay $40 and watch the company shut-down so I could just make a few people rich. As has happened with 'companies' in the past.When and if the ""company"" starts acting more professional and less shady/disrespectful to their consumer-base, I will re-do my review.Until then, I will have a close eye on them. And also warn others to not throw $40 down the tube to a company who's LEAD DESIGNER has doubts about the probability of success.Edit:To the people that are saying that I am wrong I may be BUT these are my 2 cents I am tentively watching this game as I LOVE the idea. Ever since I started gaming I drempt of this game. To the developers I hope you guys keep with the development of this game, you guys are definetly on too something here! Also as the Lead developer stated in the comments he has gained faith with all those that have bought this game for the generous fee of 40 dollars, this is reassuring and I am glad he stated that.All in all I am excited to see where this goes and ill be happily playing every update while updating this review.There is nothing ""butthurt"" about my review I am just warning people what I have seen and observed. When someone makes a game you dont critique the game you critique them in a way. That is THEIR hard work and artwork. I like to review the developers of games because you can really see their motives and if they have a true passion for the game because when it comes down to it its not about the money when your making a game (it does help dont get me wrong) but you have to be intrested in the game also it is just like studying in college for your major. If you dont like the subject you dont want to study.I hope you guys understand I am not ""butthurt"" about the game or the developers. I am excited for the game but in its current state it is a bit scary for ""investors"" to slap down 40 dollars for a game that may not live up to 40 dollars that is all.All in all again I am excited to see where this game goes and I wish everyone the best.-Tanker			"

In one sentence: After three years this game is a spectacular monument to failure.Played this game from the time it was first released as an early access game on steam up to the current date. Over this period I experienced first hand how it was evolving and where it was going. Played on public servers as well as on my own server. At times it replaced my real life which is sad to be honest. I really liked this game because it had lot of potential. However it seems that after every update it became worse and worse. I was hoping the devs would first adress the issues of the game in order for every asset to be functional. I was reporting bugs, errors, malfunction and hoped that with the next update it would be fixed. But no. It never happened. Instead each update brought assets to the Cluster♥♥♥♥ and with that came more issues.I am not going to adress each bug here because there are many and the devs know about it. It's bad sounds worse and the physics are a joke.I do not recommend it.EDITI figured there should be some more explanation why i do not recommend this game. The thing some of you have in mind are the so called pros and cons. There are many pros but they work against themselves so in the end the pros become cons.How?Graphichs: With the new models and textures + effects the game looks really good. There is a skill in the game called Herbalism where you gather herbs for making preparations like antidotes for snake bites or flux for making of mortar and steel. However the grass meshes are taller than the herbs. You need to turn the grass off in order to gather herbs. So why have good looking grass if it's not functional? The trees in the early access stage of the game were thinner than the ones that came with an update at games release. What they didnt change was the activation box which remained small. So now instead of just walking up to a tree and selecting it you need to find a spot where you can actually access the activation box to be able to select it.Mechanics: Starting from horses beeing stuck, wildlife able to walk through trees, fighting system wich ends up to be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because the hitboxes are a mess and you cant hit anyone if you arent aiming for the nuts. On the other side you have animal husbandry where you can tame few animals and domesticate them. Once you place them in barns or stables these become just listings. In the index you can see the age and quality of an animal but its just a list, the are no actual animals (meshes+textures+animations) in these stables. So why build a freaking stable? It could as well been a rock called ""the stable/barn"", you can activate it put the animals inside, feed em, clear the dung, slaughter and so on....I mean...if i need to build a massive stable I want to see the animals in the freaking stable.The Content: There are lots of things you can do. Crafting is one of them. From primitive tools basic object to more advanced ones. Every item has its quality. The better the quality of resources used and the higher your crafting skill the better the results you get - which translates into better quality tools and objects and longer durability of tools. Let's say you get into forestry like i did...increase your skill to 100 (and it takes forever to do so depending on server settins), get some sprouts and plant them. Now you have your own forest with trees of the quality 100. Usefull for carpentry making handles, boards, coal...then the devs decide to release a patch with the new tree growth algorithm they been working on for some time. What that actualiy did is lowered the quality of everyones trees from 100 to 10. Now if the game were still in it's early acces stage it would be ok because we had an agreement and everything can occur. But the game is officialy released yet it feels like we are still testing it. I dont know if the devs realize this; we spend weeks working on something which they render obsolete. We lost so much, words can't express it all.For solo players: The grind is really the only thing there is. There's no danger and no purpose really to play. As much as you might love crafting, it's going to take you absurd amount of time, hundreds and hundreds of hours to build anything. But with no danger present in the world, there's no purpose to build other than aesthetics.For groups of players: Can be fun with friends on teamspeak, but you dont need to play this game in order to have great time conversing with your friends... You could as well have a good time if you go out with your friends or just talk via teamspeak and do nothing else. At least you will avoid the disapointment in the game which needs to be constantly played, otherwise everything you have built will decay in a matter of days. Life is feudal either becomes your life, or you just should not even try to play. Then one day you will lose your patience like many of us did.These are few things i mentioned. It is difficult to go into minor details wich will cost you greatly in the long run and hope someone who didnt play the game can comprehend. I would have to explain more which becomes complex and leave you more confuzed than you were prior to reading this review.In the age of information, ignorance is a choice. Inform yoursel (read reviews, watch some gameplay videos), dont buy early access games, don't preorder games. Give your money to the developers that actualy deserve it, developers who can deliver. And there are so many good games these days worth your time and money. All gamers want is to have a good time so choose wisely  my fellow gamers.Cheers!			"

												Devs failed to fullfill any promises during development. Instead of using early access funds for this game they used it as a test grounds for their MMO. On top of that they are now branching out again and are claiming to be publishers of a Life if Feudal franchise. There isn't 1 complete game yet but they have 3 in the franchise? This is a scam. I'm sad to say that I've played this game from conception to ""completion."" Waste of time and extreamly disapointing. Do not pay for this unfinished beta piece of junk. At first it was a great concept and I looked forward to development. Development was slow, spotty, and buggy. Then they got bored with it and released it as a full version game so they could move on to their MMO project. THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE GAME. Many systems, items, and recipies aren't even implemented from beta. Nothing is optimized and no matter how beastly your rig is the game will lag, crash, and glitch. Speaking of glitches there are a tons of them and most require a GM or server reset to fix. Want to craft something? Too bad your crafting station is bugged and you have to wait until the server resets.The combat system is clunky, unrealistic and unfinished. The hit boxes don't fit the character modles and you can littereally beat most people by looking at the ground, spining in circles and swinging at their groin. You can charge someone and drive a spear clean through thier character and not have a hit register for any amount of damage. Why? b/c you didn't aim at their nuts. In short this isn't a game its a cheap concept and ball buster simulator.			"

Early Access Review
								I do not do reviews on games.... But this one I owe a review to.First off, most of all the negative reviews are from players that have not put in the time that is required to enjoy this game. It's really sad that a lot of the negative reviews have given this game a Mixed review status. I have seen one review 0.4 hours invested and they said the controls are broken....So before you start playing this game, please go to youtube and search for LiF Basics 101. You will learn A LOT of invaluable information. There is a learning curve to this game and you really never stop learning simply because there are a TON of details about what's going on that you will discover. This will make you more valuable to the community of players which is I believe what this game is about. Playing with others!With that out of the way, this game is amazing. They have come along way since the beginning. The graphics are fantastic. (When you start the game is automatically on low settings you need to adjust it!) Sure, just like every single game out there, room for improvement, is a valid complaint. But in the end, this is one of the best sandbox games out right now.Hard work pays off in this game. It will take some time to gather, build, level your way to what you envision. The reward is great once your done. Do not come into this game thinking that you can just gather a ton of stuff and instantly build stuff. It will not happen. (Unless you take the time to find a server that has high leveling etc.) You most likely WILL need help to do things. It is the way this game is supposed to be played, get it in your head. Sure you could play solo.... But it's going to be a long road.TLDR:Gritty, grindy, sandbox that will have you showing off what you build and accomplish to your community and friends. Excellent graphics, skill system, crafting and just plain fun if you put in the time. Highly recommended if you like the huge reward behind the grind!			"

Early Access Review
								After 400 hours of playtime, I think i can inform others about the game. First of it all: It's still an alpha, but the most developed one I've ever played. Combine Minecraft with War of the Roses, and you got your game. The game is, although some mechanics are highly repetetive, very addicting. It's not a game for a few hours a month and without the necessary endurance you will give up soon. If you like crafting, fighting and role-playing with other human beings, then get it and check it out. Otherwise: Don't.On the positive side you got very good graphics, a great variety of armor and weapons you can choose from and a crafting system that highly supports team gaming. You got a lot of different building, the map is large enough for 64 players and every 2-3 weeks comes an update. The sound is ok, as long as you don't put tanning tubs aside your house..The skill system is fair and interesting, because on most servers you can only skill 1-2 skilltrees to the max, and it is possible to deskill every time. It is like in Skyrim: With doing certain things, you get better at doing so and with rising skill level there are some other options you unlock. The fighting system is a bit sloppy, but also very detailed. For example: The damage you get from an opponent is the result of the weapon you use, the skill of your weapon, the armorskill of your enemy, the location of the hitbox where you hit and if your enemy is defending with a shield or not. Conclusion: Good mechanics, very high potential overall.On the bad side you have no game-goals, quests or whatever. Your experience with the game will highly depend on the server you play on, considering if your serveradmins are fair or not and how other players fashion their role on the server. The first time, of course, you will be motivated by building your town with others and learn how to work, but after your village or castle is built, you have no other option then to fight and roleplay.Considering this, there are also some broken mechanics that must be fixed soon: Since every digged tunnel on the server delays the login time of the players, it is impossible to run a 64 player server over a long time without getting a slow server. Some players on my server have login times beyond 6 or 7 minutes, and when you come to that point it will be extremly hard to get new players to join your server. Others may quit due to this and.. you get the idea, over a longer time your server will get more and more abandoned. There are some fixes to this, but nothing official is implemented yet, a server wipe is in most cases the only solution to get a fresh and playable server.Another problem is the erasing of buildings: Once built, you cannot deconstruct anything without admin help. This is also highly annoying, because you have to plan really good before building your own town.So, my conclusion: Don't start this game alone, pick one or two of your friends, start an own server to test things until you feel ready to play on a bigger server. Try to get to a server with active and friendly admins. You may wait until the tunnel-digging is fixed, but if you like crafting & boxing bears, then give it a try.			"

								Lots of potential and i mean A LOT of potential. For now it's all it is though. I just wish there was a middle thumb for ""Buy at your own risk."" But there isn't. For now I wouldn't recommend it it's still in early access and even if it's supposed to come out this year... I doubt it. there's really too much work to be done in optimization and content.Depending on the server you choose, you will be able to top your level in either a day or a month. Same goes for construction, some servers make it easy and fast, on other you will definetly feel the grind. Personally, i prefer the later it makes it more realistic, you're actually gonna need workers to build a basic town. Combat is... Well hard to explain. Skill based ? Compared to other similar titles it fairs pretty well but you're probably just gonna get an arrow between your eyes before you even know you're in a fight. Crafting is mediocre just grind grind grind and manage your stuff in a very messy inventory. Stuff just goes everywhere in there, if you're gathering for a while you open your inventory and it looks like someone took your bag and just smashed it against a couple of rocks before giving it back. So... If you're looking for a medieval fighting melee arena look elsewhere because this game is SLOW and the fighting is a really small part unless you're a thief (And usually you have a lot of rules to follow or else you will get kicked from the server) If you're looking for an historical medieval life simulator... With all the work and hardships, you're probably at the right place. I wouldn't recommend to buy it for now. I know devs need money to develop the game but at this state it's not worth 1/2 the asking price...			"

												I absolutley love this game but I can not recommend it.Life is Feudal is a hardcore sandbox game where you can terraform the landscape, build awesome villages, craft to your hearts content, and pvp with other players.I have many reasons why I can not recommend this game. Number one reason is if you have any life outside of gaming whatsoever you will eventually find out that you cannot keep up with the game unless you have a giant group of players who cordinate times etc. I was thankfully in a awesome group of almost 30 people and we were able to complete a full castle village. It took every single one of us 3 weeks and 8-10 hours a day some more for a combined low estimate of 4,536 hours just to complete to castle walls ( a week later the server was crippled by a bug a thus needed wiped), You have to have multiple people farming to see any decent kind of harvest, every building is pre fab, animals have some of the worst coding, you will find yourself standing over a pig with a axe hitting it 50 times just to down it, horse riding is badly coded, terraforming which is the best in any game I have played is the most tedious non fun thing you can possible imagine doing, if you could put you dirt into piles like Wurm it would still be tedious but a thousand times better. The devs are money greedy and have been scheming ways to make money in there beta which was originally promised to backers and early buyers, I would rather have polished content, optimization, and more stuff to craft than better lighting, grass graphics and such. Pvp encounters are lacking whether your winning or losing. My group had one pvp encounter that was fun, it was pre planned and before they added land claims both teams were back and forth seiging each others fortifications. Singleplayer blows and is basically non existant. I heard something about instanced battles and I have to say I feel that is a terrbile idea, put in instanced pvp and you cripple open world pvp.I believe this game can come on top though if good changes are made though I am highly doubtful this will happen.Even though I am not recommending this game I will probably put another 500hrs, it is addictive and I love sandbox games.

												ProsFull Loot ( Feels very much like the same feeling I got from the late great Ultima Online ) Graphics are stunning . ( need a nice gpu tho... I have gtx 980ti )Music is very medievally. Combat is slow paced which is a good thing ( meaning people dont warp around and it aint a mad crazy swinging fit of spinning forward and backward not knowing if your hitting ur enemy i.e )Crafting is well thought out. A nice balance of grind/reward ( IF YOU MAKE SURE YOU SELECT THE RIGHT SERVER FOR YOUR TASTES. Certain servers will have skill gains faster)Its a great medieval Simulation. ConsSTEEP LEARNING CURVE ( YOUR FIRST ACT SHOULD BE WATCHING YOUTUBE TUTORIALS and the INGAME HELP MENU)A big buggy stillSkill gain and crafting can be and will be a bit tedius. Thats why i recommend a server of AT LEAST 5.0x skill gain. And at least 1000 skills points so you dont have to locate 10 other people to help you build items. ( just my preference , some people might like having to haggle and deal with people all the time)Sometimes the game CTDs. Overall ... I love the game. One of the best games I've played in 10 or 15 years. Id buy it for 60 bucks. Its that goodBut to each is own. If you like building and medieval combat this game is the one.			"

												At 90 hours in, I have to say I'm really enjoying this game.I joined it as I love any type of world builder game. I'm a crafter at heart.  This game doesn't disappoint on that front. The crafting system is extremely deep and can be complex, with long item trees.  Farming, to animal husbandry, to carpentry, etc.  I'm definitely in my element there.What I wasn't expecting was finding myself on a server with a very robust social game. Kingships and Dukes, and wars, and strife and witches in the bogs.  It's been great watching and being a part of what really feels like a living breathing world.I'm looking forward to seeing what the next few months bring to this new game!			"

								The game is supposed to be coming out of Early Access in September, but I don't see it.  It still takes half an hour just to start a local session, hosting is an almost prohibitively complicated process, and, while there's definitely potential for a great game here, ""potential"" seems to be what makes up most of its feature list.I really enjoyed playing what little game there is, but with developer responses like ""we know combat sucks, but we haven't even implemented the system, nevermind balanced and polished it,"" with three months to go?(As of this writing, and combat still sucks.)Save your money, and look elsewhere.

												It is very hard to create a proper review of this game, as your experience may be completely different from mine. It really depends of the server you'll settle in.I have been : - co-leader of a small village, part time soldier for the king- second in command of an entire kingdom after my friend seized the throne by cunning and diplomacyAnd done :- building, farming, crafting, terraforming, hunting...- fighting PVP as archer in both field battles and sieges, and also militiaman against raiders- organizing a guild, recruiting new members, dealing with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t situations- A lot of Roleplay involving weddings, meetings, diplomacy, wars and back-stabbing.PROS- A very nice medieval atmosphere. Realistic, yet fun.- You'll meet awesome people (and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but that's the case in every online game)- Recommended for Roleplayers and adepts of politics/diplomacy : if you choose the right server it could be an amazing experience. It definitely felt  like a Game of Thrones ! - Building your city is more than just it looks (posing blocks), you need some creativity to make it beautiful.- Addictive.- Gameplay combat is better than most survival games...CONS- ... but combat is mediocre compared to mount & blade.- PVE aspect is non existent.- PVP is sometimes unbalanced (poisons, some weapons...)- Performances sometimes suck, and especially during massive battles.- Devs focus on MMO and do not fix bugs of LFYO as fast as they should.- Requires a lot of farming. bring your friends ! Definitely not a solo player game or someone with short gameplay time.- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ admins are legions, abusing power or simply not enforcing rules. Unfortunately there is little players can do other than leaving and trying another server.- Servers lifespan are on average one to three months : don't expect to have anykind of ""persistant"" cities, and be prepared to start over again a lot.Conclusion : if you find a good server with a nice admin, then this game is amazing. If you don't, it sucks.FOR :- fans of middle-ages - fans of RP and backstabbing diplomacy- fans of... farming stuff and building stuff.- fans of medieval warfare that do not mind some bad performance.NOT FOR THOSE LOOKING :- for a survival game. It is not.- for a quick experience or a solo game : you need to spend a lot of time on the game- for PVE : there is no real danger from beasts after a while and fighting  them is not interesting. The true aspect of the game revolves in Building/PVP/RP			"

												Edit 3: 1100 hours.  GM a server now.  Where'd my life go?  Can't wait for the MMO.Edit2: 700 hours in.  Woah. Edit: 300+ hours in.  Still great.  I'm writing this review because some negative reviews led to me almost not buying it.  I am sincerely glad that I did.  This is the game that I've always wanted.Let me tell you about my first night on LiF.  I logged into an RP server and was almost  instantly greeted by experienced players who were not only willing to help me with every question that I had - but also fillled me in on all the political happenings that were revelant to that evening.  the community, if nothing else, makes this game worth playing.Before I knew it, they outfitted me with a basic sling and some sling ammo and I was marching off to battle.  We arrived through the woods to a small fort in the north which seemed relatively empty - I was disappointed at first: This was it?  Little did we know that the enemy was crouching behind their walls equipped with heavy plated armor and bowmen galore.  After about 20 minutes, two concussions, an arrow through the chest, and general astoundment that I was still alive - I heard that the enemy king was knocked unconscious and his nobles lay dead around him.  Opposed to killing the enemy king, our king inisisted that we let him regain consciousness so he could role play his reaction to the embarassing defeat. While waiting patiently around him, celebrating our clear victory, we were ambushed by almost a dozen of the fallen king's allies from the west.  They streamed in behind us and we fled with our tails behind our legs.  By the time we hobbled back home, bloodied and broken, we had only lost one ally - a clear victory if you ask me! Since then, peace has been negotiated and I've decided to make a pacifist character. - dedicating  my time to building a religious school on top of a mountain.  That's the best part of this game, you can literally do whatever you want.  Want to be a cook? Someone needs you in their guild.  Want to be a warrior? Someone wants you for their realm.  Want to dedicate your time to stacking wood, mining deep into a mountain, watching wheat grow? Well, you're probably going to have to do it anyway. Admittedly, I've only been playing LiF for 15 hours (and that is not much for this game!) but i felt like it was my duty to defend it at least a little bit.  Yes this game is still in development, yes there are many features that haven't been implemented yet.  But I promise you that if you connect with the right people in-game then its not something you will regret contributing to.  There's a steep learning curve but once you get a hang of it everythings really intuitive and well thought out.  I can't wait for final release.			"

								I did not have the option of clicking the ""Maybe"" option.  A very interesting game but...Keeping in mind that it is just a pre Alpha and very buggy I will limit my comments to gameplay and not stability and such.The world is detailed and beautiful.  The crafting system is deep and satisfying.  As many others have said it can be a bit grindy but not in a bad way.  I felt a real sense of accomplishment when I built my first shack and began setting up my first base of operations.Just as I felt I was getting somewhere a 12 year old punk ran up to me, called my mother a bad name and smacked me with a shovel knocking me out and taking all of my hard won stuff.I tried three different servers over a few weeks and the results were the same.  Just when you feel you are getting somewhere some  rag wearing peasants show up, kill you for sport and take all your stuff, over and over.  Currently, there is no way to protect yourself from being completed looted until you can build a warehouse which takes a significant amount of skill accumulation and materials.  If you don't log in to the server for a few days even those locked items can be freely looted by anyone.The mantra is ""Life is Feudal it is supposed to be tough."" Well, feudal life was not full of phsycopathic 12 year olds that kill and loot you for sport with no repercussions.  At the moment the 'penalties' for kiling players are largely ineffective and once you acquire something worth having you can expect to be killed/robbed every few hours of gameplay.If you can get on a server when it first starts you will have a huge technology advantage over anyone that comes later and if you can make friends and work together you will be alright.  If you are a latecomer then God help you.  You will be farmed over and over.  The player turnover on every server I have played is very high and the servers quickly become full of empty shacks and half built structures.  No wonder most the servers are dead or go through frequent wipes.I really want to love this game.  There is a ton going for it  but the constant ganking/zerging/ glitching (its in alpha, lots of glitches) make the game very frustrating.    I give the game a  MAYBE because it could be great but it is not at the moment.  And $40 to play test an unfinished game is more than a little too pricey.			"

								While this game has tremendous potential, it is nowhere ready to play.  This is not pre-alpha software, this is in the developer unit testing stage.   In a few months of hard development I think this game could be something pretty awesome but at this stage I wouldn't recommend spending your money to assist the deveopers testing their code.  The user interface is clunky at best, the game is completely unforgiving but also gives no assistance to the player, the crafting lines, although intricate, make no sense and EVERYTHING takes way too long.   I continually get a deadlock error that crashes the game and then when I trie to restart it tells me to wait for the game to close.  It takes 5 minutes for the game to close so I can go back in and find I lost my last few actions.  Myself, I can't sit and play a game that tries to mask frustration as entertainment.  For example, wolves that are nearly unkillable to a brand new player, but spawn in your chosen settlement area, When you die you loose everything plus stats and skills.  To top that off you spawn in one of several points around the island and you have to start all over again, trying to make it back to your grave.  When you arrive there you are killed again by the same wolf.  I don't necessarily disagree with the concept of requiring multiple player/crafters to progress.  But to be able to make a steel sickle to harvest (yes i know you can use a flint one) you must have a prospector/miner/smelter/forger of appropriate level.  But you also need to have flux to make steel and to make flux you have to have an alchemist.  But for the alchemist to have a better chance of finding herbs they have to have ... you guessed it ... a steel sickle.Frustrations like this make the game feel like the developers making it are figuring things out as they go.   I don't believe it is unreasonable to expect a developer to have figured out how to fill in a tunnel while they were figuring out how to dig one.I don't recommend this game at this point, however, in 6 to 9 months it might be playable.

												Now let me get one thing straight, this game is not for everyone.  This game is one of the very few honest to god hardcore games I have ever played (You can attribute this to a lot of the negative reviews).  Playing solo is possible on modded servers, but if you want the REAL LiF experience by playing on vanilla, you WILL need a group of people.  This is boderline non-negotionable, this is where a lot of new players make a mistake and thus ruin the experience for themselves.Now to get on to actually reviewing it...Let me start off by critiquing it.  The game does have some honest issues.  Animations are stiff and unnatural (Which normally wouldn't be a huge issue, but this effects combat so I have to point it out), game does have some performance issues, and can be VERY tedius.But onto why I recommend the game, even though the game has it's own set of problems and isn't exactly perfect I still have to give this game a big thumbs up on it's core design philosophy.  If you enjoy a game that punishes you, a game that is unforgiving, but pays out when you work your♥♥♥♥♥off to achieve something....This game feeds this desire better than no other in my experience.  End game isn't achieved with ease.  It takes the combined efforts of you and your group working hard to achieve your goals, which gives you a sense of satisfaction I have never felt in a game before.So in conclusion, if you are the type of player who can't and won't dedicate all their free time to a game, a player who wants things handed to them on a silver platter, or a player who just might not have the time in their lives to play this game.....Please don't buy this game, the game wasn't made for you to begin with.  But if you are like me, someone who enjoys the feeling of putting in hours of work and grinding into a game to accomplish things other players don't have the stomach for, this game is meant for you.

								It is very interesting, and if you're dedicated and have the patience for this game, then it's for you. It's a nice medieval game full of crafting and adventuring, although, here's where you'll have to be patient: You could work on getting all of your stuff built and grown for 100 hours and some random people could come over, do something stupid, and then all of a sudden BAM. You're back at hour 1 again. The server could restart too, and BAM. You're literally at hour 1 again. You can't just spend 30 minutes to build stones walls and gates around your little village, no no... It can take about 10 hours to finish of none stop gathering. Oh and is there a little clift that you need to expand to get more land? No problem, as long as you got a couple of weeks of nonstop playing, then you'll get about a couple feet of land out of it for sure! And then there's the fact that you'll most likely be told that the server will restart in a month or so right after you're done. So if you got a lot of time on your hands and you have the patience to start all over again, even if you spent 300 hours on it, then here's a game for you!(sorry, I tried to write it positive, but I wrote this right after a rage quit so.. All I'm saying is that you should maybe wait until the game's finished so there aren't as many server restarts. It's actually a pretty fun game, though.)			"

								I don't know where to start with this review, but. Life is Feudal is a big open-world medieval sandbox game, i liked it as soon as i saw it, had my doubts about it but so far it is just as great as i expected it to be.You WILL feel its an Alpha game, that is unavoidable of course, but for an Early Alpha it's really awesome.It might be known as crash-simulator 2014, but after some tries with sick taming skills you will most likely get it working.The game is positively builded up in a way which makes co-operation important, which is realistic considering most games like these are filled up with players who kill on sight. It features a high range of skills which mainly makes you focus on some hand-picked individual ones.Overall some amazing work done by the devs, can't wait for this to get fully developed. "

								Life is not easy.  Nor is this game, which is great.  If you want a cookiecutter game you can instantly jump into and know how to do anything, this isn't it for you.  This game takes time to learn controls, combat, crafting, and fun.  With that, you don't have just a great game..but an adventure and experience. Don't forget its in early access right now.  Having interacted with the team, they stand behind their product and work efficently to fix and update it.  I've seen it grow and address my bugs/thoughts very quickly.  Having said that, if you want a real experience of what ""steam early access"" is supposed to be, you're going to get it here.  You will be part of a collaborative effort to build, influence, and take pride of something you enjoy and can with others. Be patient, be constructive, and realise that it is still their vision...so not all your thoughts will be incorporated.Cheers, good luck, and watch your back. All things are changing...			"

Directly quoted from store page: “Life is Feudal: Your Own” (LiF:YO) is a 64 player 3km x 3km gameworld that places you in a realistic medieval setting with the ability to host your own private world with your own rules"" (You cannot host your game without 3rd party tools. It is not included by default in the game purchase.)In addtion this game has functionality issues with anyone actively using an antivirus. Any game that requires its users to be exposed to viruses and or hack attempts should not be listed anywhere on steam.And to top things off, The MMO aspect of this game is limited to you playing on other peoples servers, Those people have installed MariaDB to operate those servers, and to open your own you will also have to install, and use MariaDB. As there is no way currently to simply open a server from the game itself. Therefore it forces you to use 3rd party tools to do what the content itself is suggesting its capeable of. I do not recommend this game to anyone untill its developers secure it, place the tools required to use its features within the game, and supply the content you pay them to access.			"

								First of all I would like to state that in comparing the reviews you should look at how many hours the player has spent. You will notice that most of the negative reviews have less than 100 hours in game. Many of which hardly spent more than 10 hours. A lot of the sudden negativity came since the game when on sale and all the kids bought it.I am not going to lie, to truly unlock the fun in this game you will need to be dedicated. This isn't a game that you play a few hours and be done with it. You also need to make friends or have friends play with you, as this game was not designed to be played solo.Make sure that if you intend to purchase this game that you have a decent computer. It is graphic and so it takes a lot of power.The devs have been very active in releasing updates at least once a month. Sometimes with a minor patch in between because of some new bugs that suddenly appeared. In each update, they keep releasing new features.As to the price of early access. To be honest I have seen a lot of early access games that aren't nearly as playable at this game. In fact I would dare to call this game LATE ALPHA as it has a lot of features already implemented and the devs do a pretty good job at testing before releasing so running into game breaking bugs is rare. I did purchase this game when it was on sale, however now knowing what I know and having played it a lot. I wouldnn't have mind paying $40 for this game.AS I STATED BEFORE. This game isn't for everyone. If you plan to play solo? Don't get it. If you don't plan to be dedicated? Don't get it. If you don't like Medieval time settings? Don't get it.ELSE, GET IT. "

								Life Is Feudal is a hardcore sandbox MMO('ish) game with great potential. You'll be able to build villages, farms, castles, craft armor and weapons. And not to mention - kill people with those crafted weapons. There's an arsenal of weapons waiting to be crafted, both ranged and melee, but not all of them are implemented yet. The game is still in alpha but you can already get a feeling of what the released game will become. It can sort of be described as a mix between Wurm Online in gameplay, and Rust with it's graphics. There's a couple crucial bugs at this point (for example the server browser freeze) and the servers go down alot, but once you get on a server and start playing there's hardly any bugs bothering you - which is pretty impressive for a alpha build these days. One thing that's important to mention though, is that this is not really a singleplayer/solo game, you would want to gather your friends or join someone else in-game when you set out to build those small, big and gigantic settlements. And you and your friends will need alot of patience in the process of building your land and skills. The world is available for you to shape and form as you like, but like the real world it's going to take lots of time to shape it. I would definetly recommend buying the game for the sandbox fans out there, but there's no rush in doing so. I would guess the most crucial bugs are getting fixed pretty soon though, and when they do Life Is Feudal will bring you tons of hours of fun even in it's alpha stage.			"

												I love this game and became very addicted to it for awhile......BUT, I eventually pulled away and have stopped playing it altogether now. The primary reason is that once you become established, you have to micro manage the game so much, that it almost becomes your life. Crops always have to be checked, animals always have to be fed, stables and barns always have to be cleaned, monument has to be maintained, etc. I played with a couple other people in one settlement, each with 2 characters to help spread the workload out, and we still had to mirco manage everything. I was inevitably waking up in the morning to check my crops before going to work! In all, I recommend this game to anyone without a life in general.			"

												Folks have heard me off and on about this game. Great graphics, bad behavior from the devs. Simply put, they don't listen. They don't care. They censor everything you do. They would remove all these negative reviews if they could. It's that bad. And if you even mention another game, as a reference, they threaton to ban you from their forums.This is NOT good behaviour from devs. They should listen to the players. But no, they would rather harrass the players which is why this game has such bad reviews. I used to promote this game on youtube, no more will that happen. I removed them all.The YOUR OWN version is the devs way of saying ""Hey, buy this and you can play our real finished online only version, but with a fee of course"". Bottom line, the players are getting screwed.The only reason I bought this game was NOT the MMO. I wanted the YO version only. But here is one of several problems the devs won't address...  Static Map. No dynamic anything. Once you learn where all the resources are, that's it, the game is boring. The random map generation. Nothing. It's the same map for everyone, with same resources in same places every time. We the players, have been asking the devs to fix this. They won't listen. So I can't recommend this game. It's a ""We only care about your money"" situation with these developers.			"

Early Access Review
								The game description for Life is Feudal: Your Own refers to itself as a ""realistic medieval multiplayer sandbox"". Sadly what has been delivered so far is a grind intensive RNG experience in frustration. While I have quite a few criticisms about this early acces game, in this review I will cover my initial thoughts, focus on my attempt at making a torch, and present my conclusion for the game in its current form.The player starts off with a small amount of food and some clothes resembling a cloth sack. From there it is up to you to start living your life any way you want. I was initially surprised by the depth of options presented in the tool tips. I could prospect the ground for ore, strip the bark from a tree, collect sticks, search for edible food on the ground, and much more. I could already picture the village I would build in my mind, bustling with life and promise. How wrong I was. Most actions in Life is Feudal are painfully slow or based on random chance. Each time you search the ground for food the action takes a significant period of time and often turns out no results. If you don’t find food you don’t skill up. If you do find food you gain a skill up, yet seemingly don’t increase your chances of being successful in future searches. My friend and I tried with default settings and with skill gains set to high with the only benefit being additional skills unlocking faster. The only things in the game that are close to realistic are extremely frustrating. Digging a tunnel  or terraforming takes a very long time and requires you to go drop all your dirt in a different location after every 5 or so digging actions.One of the most pointless grinds I have experienced is trying to create a torch. Torches are often one of the first items crafted in a sandbox game and usually one of the most simple. This is not the case in LiF:YO even though only two materials are required. The first material, a stick, is easily gathered from a tree. The second, naptha, is synthesised from herbs. The process is as follows: - Create a sickle,- Search for herbs - Gather the herbs- Discover their properties by combining random herbs- Gather more of the herbs that have the correct properties- Create the napthaWhile this initially doesn’t sound too difficult it is important to note that all the herbs look the same. You are given a random herb each time you gather so you cannot focus on collecting a certain type. Each herb was taking around 10 seconds to pick up and there are also a lot of different herb types which makes the odds of geting a specific one a lot worse. Due to poor inventory management/UI it takes a long time to combine herbs to discover what properties they have. After devoting more than half an hour to nothing but gathering and combining herbs I had not found the correct ones to make torches. In comparison It was far easier to build a house.To conclude, my biggest problem with LiF:YO is that the developers seem to equate realism with random chance. If the game were more realistic a player would be able to identify herbs by sight before gathering them. Players would be able to locate berries and mushrooms visually instead of having to click on a tile hoping for the RNG gods to award them something to eat. While the idea of the game has merit and the future of the game does not look entirely grim it is my hope that the developers shift a focus more towards something that is more user friendly and gives rewards based on work and skill rather than random chance.

												First things first. The game has a very steep learning curve. Much of it does not make sense at the outset. It is not intuitive and you will not enjoy the time you lose learning hard lessons - for example, that you need to figure out how to make a primitive hammer in order to make a blacksmiths hammer to make other things - oh, and that same hammer is sitting next to the forge thingee but that's just stickering, you can't use it.. Oh - and you can't even use the forge until you learn how to mine, etc.Looking at the negative reviews, it looks like most of those people did not get past this point. If you want fun and whimsical out of the box then stop reading now. If you're looking for something gritty and unique, keep reading.Once you are past the learning curve and get confident with the interface, it really opens up. There's no AI enemies. Just people. People will be friend or foe based on how you treat them and how you respond to their treatment. People will lie and cheat, People will steal from you and take your hard work. People will break or ignore the rules to shortcut themselves at others expense. People will bully you and exploit weakness. People will also believe in you. You will meet people. You will trust them and in turn they will trust you. You will build bonds and with those bonds grind out amazing things that you never thought possible. You will be there for them and they will be there for you. You will get addicted. You will find yourself staying up way too late or getting up way to early to care for what you've made in some foolish video game you almost didn't figure out. You will be afraid. Someone you do not know will suddenly approach you and your heart will race as you struggle to figure out what to do. Those that make is this far are all experts - skill counts for little advantage and all that will matter is how you've treated friend and foe. It's just like life; it's what you make it. Game on.  -= Update 1.1.2017 =-I've noticed a lot of people spouting misinformation about the MMO version (for example, you have to buy it again) or complaining about how things have changed or that it was so much better before. It's unfortunate that people don't take the time to understand early access - that there will be bugs, that there will be changes.. I also understand that, to run hundreds of servers it takes money to launch, and three years in that can be hard to come by. I believe the team is very much trying to do right by the game still. As for the MMO - Well. I've played it - and it's awesome. Everything is harder. The terrain, the animals, the skill tree.. Finally a game where we don't all just get a trophy for showing up.			"

								Only play this game if you've got alot of time on your hands that you're willing to commit to it. it takes a good long time to do anything, but for this type of game that isn't necessarily bad. There is an actual feeling of acomplishment when you and your group finish something that you had to put alot of effort into. Things aren't exactly clear as to what you need or what you need to do, but the community (at least what i saw of it) is almost always willing to help you figure things out. Which is more than i can say for alot of survival game communitys *cough* rust *cough cough.* If you're going into it alone don't be afraid to ask to join groups. they won't always accept you, but the ones that do are really the ones you want to group with anyway. Anyway, yes the game is enjoyable, don't go into it thinking ""I'll just play it every once in awhile,"" and make sure to find yourself a good group. Do these few things and this game is worth the time really.			"

												TLDR: Get a guild or a big group of friends. You can't play this solo. There are some things in this game that I both hate and love. I really don't know should I actually recommend or not recommend this game, I wish Steam had a neutral thumb. First off, don't buy this game if you aren't capable of doing these:- Getting some friends to this game also- Finding company to play with- Time. - Time and more of your time.- Looking for some kick♥♥♥♥♥medieval combat but with open world & crafting (you have to spend hundreds of hours before you get armors & weapons first)- PvP (to get any combat gear, yup, grind hundreds of hours, others who have done this before you on a non-wiped server will just♥♥♥♥♥♥you)It's for a specific audience. I loved the game for the first 40 hours with my friend until we noticed we were living on this game AND to actually get anywhere you have to live on this game and micromanage like hell. Take care of your stable, take care of your farm, take care of everything. It's truly immersive and when you get somewhere, you feel good that you actually made something but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is the GRIND REAL!!! To get contruction to 90 is hell. Everything you do in this game takes ♥♥♥♥ing loads of time. It's one of the most grindiest games actually I have ever witnessed.Haven't visited your coop in two days? Chickens are dead, your progress is gone with animal lore skill. Wanna make linen rope? Chickens died, you have to get more of them and you need 30 skill of animal lore to get the skill so you can make linen rope, one of the most needed items in the game. Actually it's not just linen rope, everything, get to 30 skill, unlock another skill, grind it to 30, oh wait, you need that too from skill #1, grind it to 90 so you can unlock 2 more skills.IT'S SO GRINDY!Other aspects? The graphics are good and the world is beautiful too. The world is immersive and you feel like you're living in a world.  Pros? It's immersive. It's authentic. You get rewarded from your hard work if you have the patience. Terraforming is an awesome feature. I hope they fix some of the grindy aspects at the MMO, actually make it so you can progress without having to dedicate your life to this game.Rating:Too hardcore for me, maybe coming back at some point/10			"

								This game is extremely innovative for the the genre. I always wanted a game like this one, where you are able to do whatever you want in the world. Where the world is built by players. Where societies form with certain players taking on different roles of their town. The big thing is, when these guys get the funding/develope the mechanics and features, they will release an MMO version of the game. This MMO is a distant goal, but with time and support this team will deliver a masterpiece!			"

								This game has potential and is a Wurm clone albeit with better graphics and less functionality.  Most people haven't experienced Wurm but if this game takes off the gaming industry will have something serious to learn.Unfortunately it's very expensive and it has serious issues typical of so called alphas preventing you from playing long enough to experience very much of what it presumably has coded.  So for now it's not a recommend.			"

								First, I would like to say that you will either love or hate this game, and you will know it within the first few hours of playing. I dont see anybody that just sort of plays this game here and there for fun. This game simply does not work that way. However, I will dissagree with other reviews in regards to playing alone. I play alone, and have my own little medieval farm tucked away surrounded by forest. It took me many many hours to get to that point, and the server does not skill cap anything, so people can level up as much as they want. Those types of servers, one can go solo and thrive. With that little background, the game is for the most part realistic. Almost everything in this game is time consuming, and Im not going to lie... perhaps a little too time consuming. I have a small hut, back yard garden with wattle fence surrounding it, and that literally took me three days to build. However, during the time of construction, I had to stop and go looking for food because the last thing you want to do in this game is die. So what is the goal of this game? What ever you want it to be. My goal was to simulate a nice little medieval farm, tend to it, improve it... etc. I am very pround of what I have built, and this game has some lasting rewards. Some may strive for control, the amount of weapons and possibilites in this game is ridiculously huge thus allowing them to control by force is neccessary. However, you will not really find players like Reign of Kings, just running around killing people. You dont do that in this game because their is just too much to lose, too much progress, and too much hard work being put in by people. With that being said, the community is awesome, very mature, and helpful. Buy this game if you......1. Want realistic medival simulator2. Are a dedicated player 3. Willing to actually learn the game, because the learning curve is huge!Do not buy this game if you...1. Are a casual PC gamer2. Think progress in Rust, or Reign of Kings is too slow3.  Cant deal with a little bit of bugs, not game breaking... but complete lack of understanding for early access games.			"

								This is an Early Access title at the time of writing this review.::TL/DR Version::Single (solo) players - Game is overpriced and not worth the purchase. Development is too focused on the MMO that is being built from this funding project.Multiplayer/Co-op Players - Game is still overpriced, but somewhat enjoyable with the right server and players.:: The LONG Version ::After a little more than 50 hours of playing this game, I have to honestly reject recommending this game. The videos and screenshots look great and I could not help but be very hopeful about this game. While that hope is still there for the potental of Life is Feudal and most of it's features, it has dwindled very rapidly. The fact that this game makes you work for everything, instead of just handing you everything like Minecraft, is the strongest reason why I was so interested in playing. With that said, this game feels more like an unenjoyable job than an enjoyable game at the time of this review. Life is Feudal: Your Own gives the impression of being the fantastic single-player little brother to the anticpated MMO version to be released later. I bought into the dream, and watched it crumble as soon as I tore into the wrapper. There is no single player experience to this game. Er, wait, what? Yes, you heard that correctly. The only way a person can play this game and enjoy it, or progress, is by using boosted server settings (skill rate, tunnelling rate, skill point limit) and GM commands. I tried this route, and the game had no enjoyment for me because I didn't feel that I had accomplished anything on my own, regardless of having a house and some walls. I started a second server, to play solo, with all default settings and found no enjoyment for a multitude of reasons. Life is Feudal: Your Own has no NPCs, other than wildlife. For a solo player, this makes building walls and gates for your settlements pointless. And while there are the combat skills, they are pointless against wildlife. I found myself killed by a boar several times because I was lacking any combat skills to be able to land a hit on them with melee or ranged weapons. Utilizing the GM commands, I gave myself some armor and boosted my skills, only to still die after just a few hits (usually 3-4). If there is no difference is survivability with armor, and no increased chance to hit with better skills, then what is the reason for attempting combat with wildlife? I guess the only thing left is to just be a Lumberjack and a Farmer, right? I will say that the Lumberjack role is about the only role that seemed to work for me. You can strip trees of their branches and bark, and even a few saplings. Sure you can cut down those trees, and even turn them into boards and building logs. However, you can't do anything with it without the supporting crafting skills. Most everything requires some form of metal component to build, so you also need those supporting skills. Suddenly, the skill cap is looking smaller and smaller. Farming is a mixed bag of ideas. The system to find random plants (crops) works to help you find food that you can cook on a campfire to keep you alive or plant to start your crops. That part of the farming skill system works great, but also leads into my issues with the server side of the game.The problems that do not work for me as a solo player, is the fact that the server has to run almost 24-hours of real time before you are able to harvest those crops that you have planted. Planted trees also require the server to run for an extremely long time period of real time before they have grown enough to be of any real use for the player. The server side is a mixed bag of confusion. The systems used to determine decay and time of day (in-game) will progress between the time a server is shutdown to when it is restarted. This takes place even if the server settings for decay are set to 0 (disabled). A person that is not able to play everyday, like myself, will find this to be quite annoying. Monuments that are used to protect your items from decaying, are not able to be managed while they are damaged. (See Update Note 1) If the monument reaches the end of it's hitpoints before the server is restarted, then it will be deleted upon server restart. This is the same with any other items (dropped items, campfires, snares, etc.) that are not protected or held by the player. Systems such as the growth of crops and the growth of tamed animals will not progress or update while the server is offline. It must be ran non-stop for these to progress. The slightest amount of items will overburden your character to the point you can not pick up anything, or even swap equipment. While there are storage options in the game, the storage limitations on the smaller, yet easier to craft items make them almost pointless. The larger storage options are impossible to obtain for a solo player, due to their increased material requirements, skill levels to craft, and the rate of decay for the numerous dropped items while collecting the other components. This basically adds up to the single player being a lot of the ""let the game run, while I go play something else"" type of scenerio. For these reasons, I have to warn all players looking for a single player experience to avoid this title at this time. Especially for the overpriced tag of $40 USD.I found the multiplayer side of this game to be just as much work, with a lot more frustrations. I tried several public servers and found the combat against other players to be just as annoying and unbalanced as my single player experience against boars. There is also the inability to progress on public servers (in my experience) because you are constantly being murdered and robbed for usually crappy primative tools, or the log on your back. Talking to other players, I was bothered by the need to have scheduled shifts between players to guard their settlements from being attacked while others were offline.Overall, this game made me feel like an over-worked, under-appreciated, non-paid employee that wished I had never even tried. If there was an option of getting my money back on this game, then I would love to use it. WIth the experience that I've had with this game so far, I don't think I will ever re-consider Life is Feudal: YO or the MMO in the future.UPDATE NOTE 1:--- Update 0.3.2.6 added craftable repair kits that can be used to repair damage cause by players and decay.

Played it for about half an hour today and it's crashed 6 times. The last time it ran for 2 minutes before crashing.It's very complicated with not much help either.You will spend ages trying to figure out why you can't use the bellows button on the furnace only to eventually discover you need to get minning to 60. Nowhere is this written down.Can't build anything other than a mud hut? You need construction at 30.Can't level contstruction? You need a mallet.Can't build a mallet?

								First off let me say that I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!This is probably the most fun sandbox game I've played, ever. I initially opted to start solo on my own locked instance; just to learn the ropes, learn the UI and the crafting. I figured that would allow me to survive more easily when I moved to a PVP server. I expected it to be a learning experience, not a fun one. Actually it turned out to be so much fun that I got all carried away in the crafting and forgot to check out the multiplayer experience.I've now restarted anew 3 times, as the server I settled on recently migrated. And one of my favorite things about this game is the leveling system. For one thing it makes it easy to start anew; no more spending an entire month of long grinding hours just to get back to level x at which you can finally do fun stuff. Nope, in this game you can train the basic combat skills in minutes and start to have fun. You can train your crafting skills in a couple days and hit the ground running on building. That is just great. The game is barely half way done and already it offers and amazingly rich, deep and compelling experience. It sucks you in, but in the same time it allows short gaming sessions (which few MMOs do). So even if you only have 30 minutes to play you always have something you can do. The Devs are very passionate about the game and are very active; they offer regular updates and even provide a public roadmap showing their progress on upcoming features.I've fallen head over heels for this game, it has destroyed my Battlefield 4 career. :D			"

												Life is Feudal: Your Own Review 8.5/10I bought this game last week as I wanted to play with friends, and had just tried ESO and it was not scratching my itch. I watched some review videos, and LIF caught my eye as something I would be into –after all, who doesn’t want to be a peasant and eek out an existence in a bleak wilderness setting? As long as my aspirations of Knighthood remained viable, there should be reason for optimism…or so I told myself.I hit the server with my buddy, Drek Stonebrow, and after several futile attempts to find each other, we finally hooked up –two disheveled figures in rags, hugging each other atop a bluff as night settled in. We marched to a location Drek had noticed on his way to me, and we settled in under the stars with our newly fashioned sleeping mats.On the first day we spent several (Real) hours crafting primitive tools and experimenting with them. Yup this new shovel will lower and raise the terrain…oh wow, did I just spend 2 hours digging a ditch for the fun of it? Yes. That only took the crafting of five shovels.  Hey, how about this axe? It does chop down trees…oops, broke that too. Oh well no worries, I’ll quickly break off a few branches from this nearby oak, rustle up some plant fibers, tie it all in to this shapely piece of flint I discovered, and voila, I’ll have a new axe to play with. And although I know these activities aren’t for everyone, I found it thoroughly enjoyable.Over the next few days we hammered out several long sessions where we:1. Learned to fish and hunt2.  Built ourselves peasant hovels3. Gathered stone to pave a small road4. Raided our neighbors for their goods at night5. Whistled peasant tunes and looked at our feet as a Knight in full plate came to stare down upon us from his mount and enquired about recent robberies6. Created a guild and managed to talk three other friends into purchasing the game so that we could keep the Knight off our backs (Shout out to: Thulgar, Moe Poon, and Fung U)7. Booted one of our friends from our guild for turning on us -he now has his own property. We don’t ask how he keeps the Knight away, and we don’t want to know …on a side note we should have been suspicious with a name like Fung U8. Chopped wood, dragged wood , and piled wood for 20hrs (real …agonizing…hours). The pain of this was offset by the discovery of each craftable item we produced. Oh the look of pride on Drek’s face when he finally had his forge up and running. And then it all came to a crash two days ago with the release of a new update. For whatever reason, the server we were playing on hasn’t been online since. Fung and I tried to entertain ourselves by creating new characters and raiding on several other servers, but after numerous bans, we are left scratching our heads and feeling like we have been ousted from our homeland.With nothing to do but start on a new server (Or create our own) we are left with the impression that Life is indeed futile. Despite the somewhat bad taste in our mouths, Drek remains optimistic as he claps me on the back and says:  “Damned if I am giving up. Somewhere out there, a knight is looking for a peasant to bully.”UPDATE:We made our own server. Find us at 2NerdsRaging			"

								you start off as sort of a drifter and slowly work your way up, gaining skills and exploring the island for resources. then you settle down (alone or with a group) and continually build a village/city/kingdom. this game is excellent for people who seek a challenge, like to create and build and want to shape the final product. if you only want games where you kill tons of monsters and grind for gear, LiF is not your ""cup of tea"". but if you like to build, shape your surroundings and create both an environment AND a community, I can warmly recommend this game. ;-)			"

								DON'T BUY IT YET.  $40 for something with spotty server/client stability is a bit high imo.  Unless you want to just throw money at the developers, I'd save your coin for now.I'm extremely excited to play LiF.  The only problem is, I can't.  Every time I launch the game I get about 10 minutes of gameplay before a server takes a♥♥♥♥♥♥ the client crashes or both.  The characters that I create on these servers also don't appear to be saving... I'm not sure if this is due to the constant crashing or otherwise, but is definitely proving frustrating.Now, before anyone starts screaming, ""IT'S EARLY ACCESS, IDIOT"", I realize that.  But if you're going to release a game for ""testing"" it's important that you at least have client/server stability otherwise there's no consistent environment for people to test on.In either case, this game has tremendous potential!  I absolutely love it so far.  I just can't in good concious recommend anyone pay $40 for a game with incredibly limited connectivity.  Once things stabilize, however, i would absolutely suggest checking this game out.			"

												After 224 hours of playing this game, running a server, and checking up on it from time to time, I can honestly say that I do not recommend this game. While it is unique in that it has a medieval theme amongst a sea of zombie survival shooters, it is executed poorly. Essentially, this will more than likely never be a finished, final product. Rather this is a testing/launch base for a F2P MMO with microtransactions. As the months have gone on, it's become far more evident that they are abandoning the ""Your Own"" model in favor for yet another subpar MMO. The loss of potential for this game saddens me, because what is actually here is pretty good, the crafting is deep, the combat unique (Buggy and clunky, but fun nonetheless.), decent looking character creation with the option of either gender, this COULD have been amazing, had they set their sights on completing this project before moving onto their MMO. If you're not a fan of PVP, then really, I hope you like crafting shovels and digging, or hunting terrible animal AI over and over again. In the beginning they had promised some sort of primitive mob for you to fight, or some kind of NPC enemies, but they seem to have decided to not break off from that, to once again, save it for the upcoming MMO. Now, please understand that I am not saying that the MMO is going to be bad or terrible, I cannot judge the MMO as I have not, nor have I any interest in playing it, this is my review of the LiF: YO experience, one that I am disappointed in.Also, don't judge this game based on the epic trailer narrated by Sean Bean...there are no monsters to fight.

								Bearing in mind this is infact an alpha (which many gamers are forgetting nowadays means there will be bugs and issues).This is a really fun and addicting crafting/survival game. It relies on teamwork to go beyond having a small hutt in a forest. You need a cook, a miner, a blacksmith, lumberjack, farmer, etc. You can't be all at once, so you actually need to be a part of a group to get anywhere. You can build everything from a tiny wooden hut, to a spawling castle with its own village inside massive stone walls.Playable? Yes. Though there are optimization issues. FPS isn't amazing unless you turn your settings way down.Enjoyable? Definitely. This is an amazing concept for a survival game. Every update adds more features to the game to make it more addicting.Total recomendation: Great for survival/crafting game lovers. Has more realism to it than most. There are many bugs and missing features, but this is also nowhere near being released, and updates come frequently enough to keep you interested.			"

												There are a lot of negative reviews for this game, and I think a lot of them are a bit unfair. This game is not for everyone. If you're expecting 24/7 action, don't bother. This game requires a lot of grinding, however it's extremely rewarding once you've finished the grind.The main tip i'd give people who are looking to buy the game or players struggling with the game is to focus on finding a good group you feel comfortable in. This game revolves around communal play, and spending 10 hours bantering on voice chat while you grind is a lot more interesting than spending 10 hours grinding alone in silence. Putting the grinding aside, the combat is quite interesting, though not particularly good. The game is plagued with poor performance because the developers spend the majority of their manpower on their mmo.However, where this game truly shines is in it's rp community. You'll see it all, political betrayal, forced marriages, prostitution, alliances, coalitions, kingdoms, bandits. There really are no limits to what you can do with Rp. I began playing the game without ever really being aware of the Rp aspect of it and by coincidence ended up on an rp server, and i suppose the amount of hours i have on the game can attest to how great it's been. All my hours have been on the same server, Rpclif.			"

								Totally under rated being ""mixed"" reviews.This is probably the most balanced sandbox builder I've played to date.Your skill tree is complex without being OP as you don't just gain ridiculous typical MMO quality stats. For example, if you want to build something, you need to first begin with forestry. To get your forestry levelled up you need to inspect trees/take bark/branches from them (which you can use along with stone you gather from terraforming to make tools) and then when your forestry is high enough you unlock logging which allows you to begin on chopping down trees. This leads to carpentry which of course allows you then to begin preparing the logs properly for contructing your buildings by sawing out the necessary boards of different sizes. You or someone else is also required to have the knowledge of forging which is about the 5th skill in the mining skill set, so that you can make nails. And as for terraforming, this is no minecraft ""punch punch punch"" goodbye dirt. No siree, this requires effort and time, and a lot of trips back to the edge of your mine shaft to dump countless amounts of dirt from your inventory weighing you down onto a pile, just as you would if you were digging in real life. While it is complex and a grind, it's a fun grind that feels realistic and is actually very fun and addictive, unlike the typical sandbox builders where you just gather 200 wood for a basic shack and build it in no time at all. What makes it even better is how difficult it is to construct the needed weapons to destroy these buildings. So all in all a very balanced game thus far.As for combat, for those of you who know war of the roses/mount and blade, this is very similar, directional attacks with realistic physics (body swinging into attacks to make them do more damage) and different kinds of damage given/taken by different weapons/armor (piercing, blunt, slashing etc)This is only the testing game too, and only small occassional updates are coming through as the developers are working on the main mmo coming out next year that will feature many more things including a karma/alignment system for your actions.

By this, I simply mean that while at first not knowing/understanding much, I came across one person, then a couple more people, etc, until eventually (my favorite moments in the game) this group of ours had owned a small farming/fishing/trade village. Needless to say, the very first 6 hours or so of game-time was quite unfamiliar and I had a lot of help. But from that point on, I realize now that there are probably slim-to-none other games that can replicate what Life Is Feudal is about. What do I mean? How can I say that (with only just one review/little experience)?This game boils down to having patience and having the ability to take in advice/learn from others. If you have no patience or have no interest in taking advice or learning from others, you won't enjoy this game to its fullest potential!The grind can be offsetting, the in-depth complex skilltrees can be confusing, but the learning and level of detail put into this game... I have not found one in this similar era/style, to be better. And I am still looking till this day for one to top it.You start off with basic character customization. Couple different race options, hair-styles, facial hair; you get the jist. From then, you either have no idea what to put what points into which stat/skill, or looked up a general guide and understand. If you didn't, which I didn't (at first), you'll then load into the game and be off to your new 'life'.The very first thing I can say that differs from most games: the controls. The way in which you switch in and out of different modes. Then, the way in which you interact with your environment. Not sure since when, but luckily now, you can Mass Produce things, which makes (incoming tip) gathering something such as Plant Fiber, so much easier. Now, you can follow the Tutorial, which guides you to making Primitive Tools. There are a plethora of them, each correlating with different crafts/skills. Once you have the Primitive Tools, you start to attempt to build things. You need resources of different types, in order to construct certain things. So you branch out to other skilltrees. Long story short, there is so much to do in this game that you could sit for 12 hours straight on this and not realize how long it's been!What I will not do is list pros/cons. I feel this game has enough positives in its arsenal to warrant at least a try. Hell, I was on a certain server or two, got really far in my skilltrees, then said server or two either would wipe their servers, or would be inactive/shutdown for a bit of time. I just recently got my gaming-motivation back and not even a few days later, I reinstalled this game and might even log back in after completing this review.Will you enjoy it? I have no damn clue. I think if you have a reasonable amount of time, a reasonable amount of patience and learning skills.. I *think* this game deserves a shot on your computer. Try it. I would also suggest something else, in terms of how you can get the game, but I will not say on this review (message me 'G). What I do think, though, is that if you are a person who enjoys a challenge; maybe even possess a taste for Medieval Realism, then I am confident you will enjoy this game as much as I have for my not-so-lengthy time spending (60 hours, to me, is quite a bit >.<)...Feel free to add me on Steam if you need any advice or help, I'll gladly play as well if time permits.Hope this review helped, even a little! Now get out there, ya 'Bloody Peasant!			"

								I want to like this game and want to recommend it, but, I can't.  There are too many design issues that get in the way of playability.  For example, I tired to fight a wolf twice.  a dialog appears and puts me in cursor mode and I die before I can clear the dialog and get back to the fighting the wolf.  In fact a  lot of actions seem to drop the player into a cursor mode which is a pain and complicates even the most menial task in the game.  And this game is full of menial tasks.  Raise and lower the ground at a snails pace.  After 10 swings of trying to dig a tunnel and seeing no tunnel I gave up.  You have to raise and lower a bunch to raise your skill to dig tunnels which allows you to finally get stone to make a simple cooking pot to cook anything.  You can't put rock, marble, or clay into a dropped items bag to clear out your inventory.  I've played for hours and can't even build a basic shelter yet.  I like the premise fo the game and it has potential, but the game needs a lot of work in playability for me to continue playing.  At the moment I truely feel I just wasted $40.			"

								First off Let me be clear this game is buggy its glitchy your server will probably crashed every hour. theres no back button to the main menu only an exit button. Features are missing and the ones that exist are not even that fully fledged out. That being said. This game is great at what it is now. Honestly if the devs ended up fixing just the bugs and crashes and for some reason abandoned the game. I would feel as though I got my moneys worth. However there are certain things you should know before purchasing this game to make sure you do get your moneys worth. 1. Have friends. This game will not be nearly as much fun alone and if you play on a multiplayer server. You need friends. Or atleast find some other players to join2. This game is Hard not like oh its a challenege I mean like you will spend an hour hitting a rock with a pickaxe trying to create a tunnel to mine from. You need to be willing to invest time and to learn the crafting system.If you can deal with these two things you should be fine. Another thing I noticed is people complaining about the combat. The hit detection is actually amazing if you miss its because you suck. That being said the swing direction registering is not nearly as good as M&B IMO "

												Short and sweet: If you like realistic sims (specifically Medieval era here, hence the name) than this is your game.  I have never enjoyed a crafting/survival game more than this particular gem, to include all of the Rust/Reign of Kings clones out there (which are fun as well in short spurts). The learning curve can be relatively steep, and the time investment required to get a fully functioning village or even a sword can be tremendous, but it's an utter blast if you don't mind the challenge. Mind you, the developers did a weird turn and released a somewhat different version of the game than what we had been testing throughout Alpha, so some repetitive glitches have been reintroduced. I'd say overall the Devs made a really poor decision by calling this a ""released"" product, and I fear that the hopes of their MMO and sales will suffer as a result. Nevertheless they're chipping away at the bugs currently, and I cannot recommend this game enough for the older generations out there that want a gritty, realistic experience.  Kids should probably stay away. Not enough graphical prowess, steep skill/combat curve, and no magical doodads to fiddle with.			"

								I've played this game enough now that I feel comfortable to put my seal of approval on it!It has a lot of potential, and I can't wait to see how it turns out as an MMO. Sure it's grindy, but at least the grind makes sense. You aren't grinding ""XP points"" or stupid tings like ""pixie medals"" to spend at vendors like in other RPG's. In fact, there are no vendors! EVERYTHING is player run and all work is done by hand. You want make 30 swords for your group of friends? Better invest in smithing related skills and buildings and go out and mine and/or barter for the metal ores. The map is 100% terraformable. Everything down to the grains of sand you walk on can be harvested and has a possible industrial use. The game is still in development, so combat is a bit wonky and it currently lacks critical things like horses and siege mechanics. But the player skirmishes and the building aspect are already a lot of fun.A few things that annoyed me:- Claims system: I won't go into detail here, but the forum is full of it. This mechanic needs a lot of work!- Terraforming: This is the least enjoyable part of the game. If you are a builder you will spend a lot of time leveling the ground. There is an observer mode, but this cannot be active during the actual digging. Also, mining leaves very ugly unrealistic ""minecraft style"" block shaped holes in the terrain and locks those cells for future terraforming. So digging tunnels is a perfect griefing tactic which permanently ruins someone's village/castle.- No NPC's other than wild animals. I wish we could let NPC's reduce some of the mindnumbing tasks like terraforming or to man the walls of your keep. What human player wants to spend their gametime playing guard on a watchtower? It would also make the villages feel a lot more alive.- Strange skill requirements: I understand the 600 skillpoint cap. Every society needs specialists if it wants to be more than a tribe of mud people. However what I don't understand is why I need to become a farmer and progress through several other professions in the same ""line"" before I can become a tailor. Especially when there are such harsh limits on the amount of skillpoints I'd like to have more precise control over how I invest them. I also don't understand why I need to train a skill to even equip a sword I looted off a corpse. Why can't I just be far less effective at using said sword  without formal training? That would make it a lot more realistic.I've already put hundreds of hours into this game, and I'm hoping to continue to add many more in the future!			"

								First let's get this out of the way: This game takes time and is quite a slow paced game. And expecting otherwise and getting this game will be entirely on you, because it's very much said to be right off the bat :PNow, with that said, we can talk about the game itself. I think this game is at a great start for early development, and the potential is phenominal. I've easily no lifed this game (No really... I got the achievment and everything.) and am still looking forward to playing more. It mixes RPG and Sandbox surprisingly well, making them both interdependent on one another. You need to level skills to build, and you need to build to level skills. Then there's the fact that other than using prefab structures, you get to design everything else to your liking. You decide how big or small your settlement or even castle will be, given if you're willing to put the time and effort into finishing it. This game won't be for those who like to get right in on the action, and if that's your cup of tea, I don't advise expecting it to be so. Though I will still suggest it, because you never know. This game makes you feel like it's the simulator that it is. If I could change anything about this game, it would be the green bar. But I'd change it to something they already plan to replace it with, metagames; something to keep you occupied and alert instead of staring blankly at a loading bar. There are a few bugs here and there, though I can't remember examples since I haven't played in a while, but I know there was. And that's to be expected, it's early alpha. VERY EARLY. It really is obnoxious to see how many kiddies whine about bugs or the fact that it's not done in some areas, because it's exactly that; early alpha development. It's like wanting a diamond out of graphite; It's not, but in time it can be. But I digress, this game is still fairly polished compared to other alphas, some even that are near beta. You will also find this game is NOT to be played alone, for extended periods of time. While it can be done, it's soon apparent that you'll need friends to aide you in your endeavours. So, get your guild/steam group/clan ready and get to work!So concluding my review, I'll rate it on categories:Bugs(Expected to change as it's developed): (few crashes, nothing else that's game breaking) 7/10Graphics(doesnt effect overall rating, but some people play for graphics): 10/10 (If you have the rig to support the graphics on max)Optimization: 8/10Replayablility: 9/10NewUserFriendliness: (Not going to lie, this game requires out of game sources to actually get the ball rolling.) 5/10Potential: 10/10Update Frequency: 7/10Overall Rating: 8/10*EDIT: So I forgot to take into account the sheer price of the game. If this is your kind of game, it will be worth every penny spent. However, if you don't know what you're getting into and don't like it, then you may find you're out $40.			"

								I'll be honest. This game does love to eat your time. After you build your first shack you feel invincible... until a naked man with a 2h sword chases you away, but if you pray really hard you can just fall from the sky back home. Lots of time digging ditches, finding clay, making things with clay, wondering why you can't make more things with clay, drop all your clay, and go back to digging ditches. It makes you wonder why you don't just go outside and dig a ditch, but let's be serious it's cold out, or hot out idk i don't go outside. Anyways 10/10 awesome.			"

												It's a very grindy co-op sandbox. Where Grindy just doesnt really do any justice as to explaining how grindy the grind actually is. It's a kind of rewarding grind though.. in a Stockholm Syndrome sort of way.       ""Oh! It gave me a point! It likes me...""You'll also need to con at the very least, 4-5 friends into playing with you for around 20+ hours before you'll have almost gotten to a point where you feel like you may be able to accomplish something soon... maybe. The only way to get anywhere solo, you would need to run your own server and then cheat. I saw in another review, ""The only thing that comes easy in this game is Death"" and that is the truth!It's not ready, yet. Which pisses me off, because I really want to play this game! I played a fair bit when it first came out and decided to put it down for awhile due to bugs/burnout. I've come back again after a year or so and I can tell there's been some progress but it's still too buggy for me. I'm 20+ hours back into the game and I've found a bug that basically has the entire group stuck in limbo on the cusp of getting metal tools for the first time... and it's not going to happen. So we're going to put it back in the oven for another year. Expect an update in 2018... fingers crossed.			"

												Day one and a farmer stopped me and pointed me to the village of Applewood where the inhabitants offered food and clothing in return for labour. Void of anything of worth, I took her advice and made my way to where a builder was hard at work, building a great wall around the village. We greeted each other and soon I was invited to join the village.---Day five and we are tracking down a group of bandits. My sword skills are undeveloped due to helping finish the wall yet I join my new brothers in the hunt until we corner our heavily armed quarry as they leave a major settlement. The stand off is tense, neither side wishing to draw first for fear of the reprisals. The sound of steel rings out as a sword is drawn, the melee is one of chaos, tactics go out of the window. My sword feels feeble, my bare chest exposed and my iron clad adversary unstoppable. I manage a glancing blow on his left side, a more meaningful one to his right but his two handed axe is unrelenting, it's great arc of death formidable and I am hewn to the ground.10/10 would draw my sword again.Island of Elli is in my opinion the best RP server (199.102.79.66:22685) Heavy RP with no tolerance for griefers.

								I'm in a valley. It's dark.. possibly the middle of the night? I've been digging all day. I'm trying to stop the dirt from falling in to my man made hole. Creating a shelter is difficult. My hole is half complete. I light my camp fire with the little resources I have left, take a swig of water and get back to work. I'm pulling out my pickaxe when all of a sudden I hear a snap of a twig behind me. Before I can turn around, a man wielding a large club has knocked me out cold from behind. I collapse in to my hole and he starts pouring dirt over in to my shallow grave. When he has packed the dirt solid, he sits on top of my grave and feasts on a chicken leg that he cooked over my camp fire.. and all the while I'm wondering, devs.. where is the 'Gary' DLC? 9.5/10 No game is perfect.

												Welcome to Work Simulator: 2016That is what this game.  Work.  You work at getting raw materials.  You work at building structures.  You live.  In a medieval setting and as someone who has done medieval re-enactment I can say LIF isn't terribly far off the mark duplicating life in that era.  The game itself is certainly picking up speed as the dev team seems to be working harder and harder on the game.  Updates are becoming more frequent and issues such as the blinking sky and invisible trees seem to be dealt with.  At least as of this date.  The graphics are excellent.  Even on my potato computer the visuals are lovely and my fps stays stable around the 20 mark.I know for many of you a game must be 60 fps but games in early access rarely come close to that mark.  ARK did not see an improvement in fps until late in its dev cycle.  Just as an example   Also, this is a very social game.  Playing it alone or on a dead server will bore you to death.   Unless you are truly dedicated.  A few tips for new players:1. There is no rush to settle down.  You can live nomadically for quite some time living off of wild apples from apple trees.2. When you do decide to settle down look for an area that is fairly flat and is reasonably close to stone, clay, iron and water.3. While a variety of crops are nice, the two most important are wheat and flax.  Wheat for taming animals and flax to make clothing and rope with.4. Plan your settlement in advance and get your claim monument up as fast as possible.			"

								This game has offered me hundreds of hours of entertainment, and some of the greatest gaming experiences of my life.This is not a review of the contents of the game itself, but rather the effects of playing the game with a large community of players.Playing online on a server with an active community forces you to get into diplomacy, which is a first in any game for me.Other similar pvp-oriented games do of course offer diplomacy, but never have I had to ride up to the gates of a great kingdom and ask for assistance, and end up a vassal for a kingdom much larger and powerful than my own.When starting a conflict or a war, you have to pick sides, maintain alliances, choose whether or not you're strong enough to sustain vassals, that in return will provide you with their military strength.You have the option to display your strength to neighbouring kingdoms and risk war to prevent being attacked, or just lie down belly up and hope they take pity on you.The allies you choose, can result in major server-wide conflicts escalating, and breaking alliances can have the same effect.The choices of one kingdom affects all kingdoms.These are all features created by the community itself. Not because the game rewards it, but because the game allows it. And it's something that really puts Life is Feudal apart from other similar games.I give this game a big thumbs up, and I'm looking forward to the finished product.			"

												Background: I have little time in survival/crafting games other then some time I put into minecraft years ago and a few hours in Don't Starve. The fact that they are all in early access for years turns me off. I followed this game since release because I liked the setting but only picked it up around March16 after they had upgraded the engine and ironed out alot of issues people complained about. I just had the itch to craft.Short and Sweet: Deep crafting systems, nice graphics, Long building times and skilling up can be a negative to some but it makes the accomplishment SOOOO sweet. Engine still seems to have issues and doesn't run great, concerning if they are using the same everything for the MMO. Worth it if you enjoy crafting games and don't mind that it takes awhile to craft things.Notes: I originally was turned off by the menu system, ""why can't I just click a bunch of times to chop down a tree?"" Well you can set an action to default click the menus are there because of all the options and how deep the game is compared to most open world/crafting games on the market. Bottomline: I spent 70 hours on a server that had speed up on leveling up your skills as well as a higher cap, however things still went at a snails pace. This is a great crafting/openworld ONLY if you can deal with the slow pace. Example: If you need logs for a house? You have to carry a giant log on your back slowly to your work site. Not just chop it down and place 30 logs in your inventory.			"

								Great game which forces you to seek a group and play cooperative.Don't let other reviews fool you, most will only try it alone and fail, leading to a frustrated downvote.Also it is not a casual game which would give you all of its content within few hours, but it takes some time to experience the whole content - which is already in this Alpha state more detailed and extensive than in most fully developed games.But if you are willing to create a beautiful evolving medieval settlement together with friends or random people you will meet, try this.

												I'll start out by saying that the game has massive potential.  The skill systems and crafting are wonderful.  But there are a few problems that have been present for extended periods and make the game nearly unplayable for extended periods.  The method the game uses for saving changes to the terrain is very inefficient, which makes it very difficult to maintain a server for extended periods of time.  And if you terraform below the elevation of the water anywhere on the entire map, it causes corruptions in the game database which results in ongoing lag.  Leaving tree stumps after cutting down trees also causes server lag, and so does having too many trees on the server.  Each of these issues don't seem to be terribly important on their own, but they have all been present for an extended period and the game developers continue to add new features and have moved on to working on the MMO version fo the game rather than addressing existing bugs.  Until the developers give the game the attention it needs, this game is not worth playing.			"

												Great game!The Good:1) Feels very rewarding when you get a settlement thriving and growing with your friends2) If you like grinding, this is another good game for you because you have to get your skills up3) There are many different kinds of servers, for example, RP servers, etc.4) Tons of content and ability to interact with other players.5) If you have a lot of time, play this! You'll feel accomplished.The Bad:1) The same thing as 2 under ""The Good"", its very grindy and if you don't have a lot of hours prepared to get invested, don't bother.2) Its slow and can be frustrating at times.3) There are still glitches that are getting ironed out.I highly recommend this game, especially for the people who love RP!

												When you get an a achievement ""This is indeed your second life!"" you stop and think for a moment I only terraformed all the time? And yet there are alot of other things to see and to do.Pros: Perfect for roleplay         Deep and complex crafting system         great graphics, even on low settings looks pretty good.         Challenging         Complex skills so you always can try new things         Pretty good combat system, but it still needs a little to be fixed.         It feels rewarding.Cons: Terraforming slowly kills you inside          No social life.			"

								Normally, I refuse to buy Early Release games for obvious reasons - it's an unfinished product. It usually has me asking, ""Why would I spend money on something that isn't finished with no guarantee for its release?""Even as it stands in its current stage, it's a great game with plenty to do - and this is coming from a person who typically hates Sandbox genre games.Pros:-More than enough to do-Great to play in groups-Feeling of accomplishment when you actually build something-Scale of map/construction-Logical and realistic sandbox:            -Survival mechanics            -Building mechanicsCons:-Questionable developer choices when it comes to storage-Obvious bugs due to it being an early release-Harsh learning curve      -Not noob friendlyI wouldn't recommend this game for people who want to play 20 minutes at a time or for younger people as it requires a bit more of a mature thought process. However, if you like the Mount & Blade series, it's similar to Persisent World Mod mixed with Minecraft. Mind you, this game is only the early release. The actual game will be a Massive Multiplayer Online with player driven politics and the world we be constantly changing based on real players' decisions. There are no NPCs, Quests, or any of the other typical things of an MMO - it truly is a sandbox.			"

												If there is one thing I can say about this game its that it caters to a very specific audience, and it caters to that audience very well. If you've ever played an RTS or other overhead style of build and conquer game and thought to yourself, ""Wouldn't it be cool if there was a game like this where everyone played own of the little pieces rather than having one person control them all?"" Then you might really enjoy this game, because thats what its all about.LiF is a teamwork game where individual MUST work together to build something substantial. This is not a good single player game, its not designed for that, you will lose your mind if you try to play this game single player, or even try to go it alone on a multi-player server. 99% of the capabilities of this game come from interacting with others to create something. This game is also relatively slow pace, as you look through the comments sections you can see that most people giving a thumbs up have 1000+ hours in this game. The result is that people work hard and long to develop things in this such have strong sense of pride when its done. The amount of work and effort that goes into actually achieving things in this game makes griefing much more difficult than in other similar games, and the necessity of teamwork makes it much more compatible with Roleplay for those who want it.In my experience this is a great game, but you have to know what your getting when you buy it. If you want action and to be the hero of a grand and epic story, this is probably not the game for you. If you want to experience a truly immersive take on medieval life and contribute to making something greater then just yourself, this game is for you.			"

								November 2014 post - ""167 hours and rising, Crashes for me are minimum, Hitboxes in combat are a bit out of wack, but thats perfectly fine. overall despite the brief review this game is very fun i must admit. I read alot of bad reviews but a ton of good ones as well. My rating for this game is 8/10 but then again i havnt stopped playing this game since i bought it.""UPDATE: 6-20-2015, So I took a long break allowing the team to implement some new things..boy was it well worth it. The dev team has really stepped it up and has added so much stuff. Unarmed combat, horses, poisons, other wildlife..Yes the hitboxes are a little iffy but they are a bit better. Overall this game is downright amazing for an alpha. RoK has things that this game dosnt but this game is alot more promising. I have tried and played ARK and still found myself coming back to this game. If you are scared to buy it, grab a group of friends, or hit the forums. Dont be scared to hop into a server and roll with it. With about 300~ hours on my belt, and a combined total of almost 1500+ hours with all my friends combined this game is well worth the bucks. Its a little slow to begin but trust me once you meet some people and get some friends together it definately picks up. My friends and I are on Valhalla's Garden PvE/PvP server located in Dallas! pick it up stop by, kill some things or build up a house or maybe even a keep. I strongly recommend this game 10/10 it may be an alpha stage, but very much worth it			"

								This is the game that you've been waiting for! It is reminiscent of the MMO's / multi-player games of old that we all got hooked on (Ultima Online, Mount & Blade). It's creative, challenging, and extemely addictive!The innovation in the design focuses on group play, and requires you to be part of a team in order to survive, much less succeed. The equipment is centered around crafting, in fact everything in the game is crafted. Want to be a blacksmith, with your own forge, furnance, and anvil? Great! But you better make friends with an herbalist so you can trade for flux to make steel from those iron ingonts you've been hoarding or you'll be left in the stone age!LiF: YO is the little brother of the expected MMO version that's still under development, and to be released later as a much more massive game.Even though this game is still in Early Access / Alpha state, it is very polished and worthy of support. A big thumbs up to the Devs so far.			"

								I have put couple hundred hours into this game and I can honestly declare that I love it. While there are a few major bugs that can sometimes act as ""game breakers"" the Devs seem to be right on top of it. I wouldn't recommend this game if you want everything handed to you on a silver platter. This game is pretty in depth, and requires the time to be put in, but the pay off is quite rewarding. I played the first 2 weeks starting a place called Newville with a few other Noobs. The Admins took note and actually helped us turn it into a capitol city for their server where he helped new players learn the game in a safe place. It is moment like that that I'll remember most. Then I left Newville and became a mass murderer, again rewarding in it's own way. How you play is up to you. Buy this game, support it and you wont regret it.			"

												Been playing the game for 14 months now and still enjoying it a lot. If you like a medieval sandbox game with survival, crafting, combat, building, etc. then this is your game. It's awesome to play in a group and form a guild, get a big city going, see a community grow and grow into a large kingdom.The devs of this game are working hard and are dedicated to their players. Lately we have had weekly updates fixing bugs and adding new features of the game. They are listening closely to player suggestions and feedback,Be aware though, the game is not completely finished. It has bugs and unfinished features. Don't expect a fully functional game, you will be encountering issues regularly. If you don't mind this, then go ahead and buy the game!A last note, a YO copy of this game will give you a free slot on the MMO next year. So if you plan to play the fully functioning MMO (Summer-Fall 2016) buy it now with a 40% discount! "

												Honestly, at this point, it's hard to not recommend because the game COULD turn into a game I've ALWAYS wanted - a medieval RPG with a player run economy, politics, and world. That appears to be the vision, but it stumbles in execution. It's just so... bland. I have two underlining problems with the game. 1. the amount of time it takes to make things. Don't get me wrong, I understand where the devs are coming from. I think they're taking a similar approach to EVE Online, where acquiring new licenses for certain ships took literal YEARS to do. And that's fine. But it's pretty dull to sit there and watch my character take 3 minutes to cook a fish. That's literally half the time it takes me to cook a fish IRL. As the game stands, I feel like I need a book to entertain me while whatever is going on in the game takes its time to finish. It sounds like part of what they're going to do in the MMO is create mini games for everything to fill the time in, and that might help, but I still think taking 10 minutes to do anything meaningful is too long. The purpose of the game should be survival and construction, and you don't need to create mechanics that cause you to spend every moment of your free time to accomplish the most base tasks. The time spent should be spent on making things truly epic.2. The game seems pretty empty. You walk into any town, and it is empty. Empty homes, empthy trading posts, empty ""schools"" - all the building are there only for aesthetics, with no real reason to exist. At the very least, being able to fill them with furniture would be nice. At the most, the furniture you fill it with should all serve some function. And all of this compounds problem 1. What point is there in spending 10 real life hours to build my first humble shack when there's no real purpose to it? I guess if you're into things like legos, and you enjoy building things because it's fun to accomplish something, than this might suit you. But I play games because they're interactive and allow me to do things I wouldn't normally be able to do IRL. So we'll see, maybe the promised MMO will fix those two issues. But as it stands, I didn't really have fun in this game and don't recommend it.EDIT: When I wrote this review, I intended it to be just my two cents on the game. Instead, it has become the ""most helpful"" review of this game. I only noticed because I get comments every other day from some very passionate fans. Still, I thought it would be a good idea to follow up with a few comments (and fix a grammar mistake or two in the original review). First of all, people getting worked up on whether it actually takes 3 minutes to make a fish IRL are missing the point. One of my favorite game series of all time is the Sims. In that game, your sims do such mundane tasks as poo, eat, laundry, and dishes. But you're empowered to tell a story. It gave you a canvas to tell a story that could spread over generations. It made every in-game day special as you worked towards whatever goal you had established for your virtual family to achieve. Of course, it didn't hurt that Maxis' (and eventually The Sims Studios) signature humor was sprinkled throughout.LIF is missing all of that charm. It takes so damn long to do anything, every task is a chore instead of an exciting step towards a greater adventure. There is no charm, just a generic medieval world with even less character. Obviously I've already mentioned how everything felt empty. The game just needs something, anything, that's fun. As it stands, all you have to hope for is finding a decently populated server where some good samaritan will donate a basic set of arms and armor to you, allowing you to participate in fights sooner. Oh, and you die fairly quickly. If everything else is useless and the only point is fighting, why not make a pure fighting game?Finally, yes, I only played the game for 1.1 hours. I don't have a problem with that. It isn't my responsibility to figure out how to like a game, it's the developers responsibility to sell me on their game. They failed to win me over in the alotted time and I feel other, like minded gamers should know about it. I agree with others, it's a little disappointing that the review from the guy who played for 1.1 hours is currently ""the most helpful"", but my intention was just to throw in my thoughts. That being said, those who've played for a few dozen hours have walked away with similar impressions. Regardless, I had watched a few hours of Let's Plays, but because it takes so long to do anything in the game and the videos tended to be heavily edited, I thought it would be worth trying the game out. My dream game is where I can live in a medieval world. Be a tavern owner making ale and attracting all the adventurers in town as we discuss the latest war and get buffs from my ale. Be a farmer and cower as I run from the most recent raid by a neighboring fiefdom. Be a merchant and sell goods from city to city. Be a guard-for-hire and assist caravans as they travel the sands. Be a part of a political movement as we overthrow the current government. Be a rogue group of hedge knights that fights for the freedom of noobs all folk, giving each new soul a fair shot in the harsh world. This game is not that game. That's all I'm saying.			"

												Let me begin by saying that I hardly take the time to write reviews. Not even on games that I adore heart and soul. This game, however, has forced me to give fair warning to anyone who may be interested, because it can be hard to find clear answers around both the love and hate this game has. I'm no authority, and this is no expert critique, but it is my opinion.In truth...I liked this game quite a bit. As both a roleplayer, history buff, and all around nerd, the concept of this game instantly had allure. It also didn't help that me and my gaming group are all seasoned veterans of Warband's PW modification, so it was destiny that we would end up playing this game. My friend bought me a copy (#poor) so that I could join them on this game. At the time, I had been on the fence about getting it, as the reviews were mixed and I had heard many bad things. I was convinced because the friends who had been playing had already enjoyed it immensely.So why can I not recommend this game if I liked it? Well, I have seen many complain about the time it takes to do something worthwhile, or about the combat system. My issue is with none of these, but insteads sits with the developers and overall state of the game itself. When I started playing, the game was a buggy mess, albeit a fun buggy mess. Over half a year later... it's STILL a buggy mess. Furthermore, the game lacked many requested features and felt a bit bare. It is still lacking a vast majority of these features and feels bare. Back when the first of my friends started playing, it might surprise you to learn that the game was actually a bare, buggy mess!You get the point. The game has issues, but the problem is that so little of those issues are being actively resolved by the developers. To add insult to injury, they have decided to go ahead and release a new game. Clearly, we can see where their time and effort has gone the last year or so...and it wasn't towards this highly unfinished product. They have for a long time planned and talked and announced news towards an MMO, apparently the intended version of this game. Many are excited for this. However, I'm not sure how they can pull of a successful MMO when they have yet to get anywhere near finishing a game that still costs 40$. Now, there is talk (albeit rumors) that they have partnered up with a company that specializes in micro-transactions.I could go into more detail, but the bottom line is that the progress and work put forth towards this relatively expensive beta (mind you the game is labeled 'fully released') has been nothing but disappointing, and I do not see it getting any better. As we get further and further on, it seems more or less like a cash-grab by the devs, or at the very least a passion that has died down. Really, this is just another case of a larger disease plagueing our recent gaming world, but it unfortunately claimed such a fantastic idea as it's victim.Save your money: wait for Bannerlord or splurge on CKII DLC. You'll avoid the sadness of a great idea unfinished.			"

Early Access Review
								This is my first review, because I feel that I have to recommend this game, but also warn you:Life is Feudal is still in Early Access, but currently offers a lot of different mechanics. Finding yourself washed ashore on an big island with nothing on your body except for something to eat and some rags, you have to create everything in the game from scratch. You build your own tools from branches and stones, find some roots to eat and create your first Tiny Shack. All this building, crafting and planning (terrain flattening alone is an art/skill) takes unbelievably long time, which may annoy some people. If you are extremely impatient just skip this game - it's nothing for you.On the other hand it is extremely satisfying to create your own buildings. Until I had a forge (which is needed for nails, for example - so a rather basic building), I spent around 20 hours in the game. When the forge was finally done, I was just proud of myself.One reason it takes so long to achieve process, is that many activities take a lot of time: snapping a branch from a tree? Around 2 seconds. You need 20 branches for a building? Click 20 times on the same tree and simply wait each time 2 seconds. This can be annoying with the time, so better get used to it and watch TV on a second screen.Having friends that play with you is not only nice, but highly recommended. With on character you aren't able to succeed in the various skill trees (or if you try you end up as a bad jack-of-all-trades, who is able to some jobs a little, but nothing really good). The strange server structure (everyone can host a server) leads to a huge variety of servers, leaving the ""public"" servers rather deserted, so don't count on meeting many people around there.As already mentioned, there are several skill trees, like Herbalism, Carpentry, Smithing, Hunting and so on. Each of them uses different mechanics, so it is fun to try them all out. Some of them are extremly fun (building, carpentry), some of them are okay/highly repetitive (mining takes literally hours...) and some of them are simply boring and stupid (especially herbalism). At a later point you need high level material (like steel and mortar) so called Flux which can only be gathered by Herbalism people, who have to search for hours one small area of herbs and then combine them in an annoying mini-game and hope for some luck.The second rather bad mechanic is the whole fighting module. Right now you can hunt animals, some agressive like wolves or boars and some peaceful like sheep or deer. The AI of these animals is simply stupid, you have to shoot them with around 10-15 bullets of your sling to kill them. During this annoying process they do not move a bit (or run away like 5 squares then stay still again). Even the dangerous species try to attack you only once, after you land one successful shot, they stand still like all the others. Even achieving higher levels of weapons (you have to learn Throwing Weapons, then get hit with Leather Armor on, then learn Crossbows and THEN you are able to use Bows) does not significantly lower the time you need to hunt an animal. This is truely unsatisfying and outright bad right now. If the fighting against other players should feel the same like fighting against animals, this would be desastrous.TL,DR:++ Extremely satisfying to build structures+ Great when playing in small communities+ Different mechanics to learn with each job-- Huge effort of time neccessary to achieve something- Long waiting times during processes- Difficult to learn (Wiki helps a great deal)- Combat Module isn't any funAll in all I can recommend this game if you are looking for a challenging medieval-crafting-simulation. If you are impatient or believe that this game is all about building forts and playing knight, go away. You will be disappointed. But if you like grinding for ressources and want to build a small village with your friends - this is your game (Early Access and all).			"

The game lacked explanation of many aspects, and often you are too busy playing the game like its farmville to actually enjoy its potential.Great concept.poor deliver in early alpha.hopefully with advancements this will beome a huge hit, but as of now i just do not see this game being one of the hundreds of games in your library that will remain unplayed.

								Mixed reviews? WHY!     Easily one of my best/favorite games in my library, amazingly realistic and hard to pickup, and even when you pick it up and understand how to make♥♥♥♥♥♥(Difficult at that) you still are not considered good, as there is no good. Eventually you must trade to grow your village quicker, and even then it takes weeks, even months to build a house with a few necessities. I cannot stick to a game more than a month before i grow bored and move onto another. HOWEVER, IF you are the type to sit down and play a game for months on-end, this is for you, if you can check it every now and then to reclaim and collect then GET THIS GAME. Totally worth the money along with the MMO being free for those who buy now. LOVE IT and if i were to recommend a game to any of my friends it would be this one. I hope my review persuades you to get it and to get it's  name out.			"

Yet this game is incredibly amazing, the rp potential is immense and immersive, the players are 9 times out of 10 relatively friendly and will let you yield in combat. This game is easily worth the 39.99 they want for it (in my opinion) I would strongly encourage anyone with a strong will to learn a game before judging to buy it. You won't regret it. You do have to put in a lot of effort and time to learn and advance in it, but boy is it worth it!			"

												Absolutely feel ripped off by these developers. Very unprofessional and just another game that should not be supported by Steam to rip off the community. This game should be removed from Steam ASAP. Everyone who bought this game like I did in its early development was ripped off.This is my first review so don't hate on me too badly. Out of all the games I have bought and played, this is the only one I have ever reviewed - Mostly in the hopes others don't waste their money. First off.. Game is riddled with bugs. Poor design choices, terrible netcode, fluctuating frame rates, random crashes and other stability issues. It's a complete mess.Gameplay?? If your another person like me who bought this game for its roleplay value, you will be disappointed. Every mechanic I wish was there isn't. Everything is terribly redundant. The game is not, and never was intended to be finished. Everything about this game is unfinished.. The AI is terrible and the gameplay is worse. If you enjoy watching a terrible paint job dry, this ones for you. This is what I keep seeing all over.. Whiteknights for this game claim it is a run-up to the MMORPG. Well I tell you what.. I was never aware when I bought this game when it first arrived on early access that I was basically donating my money to another unfinished and never to be finished product. Why you ask yourself is this an issue? Sure, you helped fund the creation of an MMORPG - Well, the problem is they have sold out on the one thing people hoped for. They have recently partnered with XSOLLA and fully intend to embark on a P2W model. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!?!? AFTER I PAID 40+$ WHATEVER DOLLARS AND HELPED FUND THE CREATION OF THIS MMORPG AND THIS UNFINISHED AND ABANDONED GAME, I NOW HAVE TO PAY MORE?!?!?Ridiculous right? No, just another group of scam artist dev's hoping to rake in on your cash for what I fully expect to be a never to be finished MMORPG.. Wait.. Then they will say they are going to use the money from the MMORPG to create an actual.. Finished game! Incredible!I hope people read this crappily written review and do NOT support the pillaging of the Steam community by games like these!THIS IS THE ONE GAME I WISH I NEVER EVER BOUGHT 24.4HRS ON THIS GAME WAS PAINFUL!!Please do not make the mistake I did and give these people your hard earned money. They don't deserve it.			"

												I absolutely love this game. Wish I had gotten it sooner, but the mixed reviews threw me off.  My favorite type of game is the survival/crafting genre and this is by far the best of the bunch IMO.You actually have to work for everything you achieve, in other words you don't have everything handed to you in the first couple days of gameplay, Has a very deep crafting system which I love, it's more realistic and true to the era. I play only PVE and it keeps me incredibaly occupied as there is so much to do .I highly recommend this game to those that enjoy crafting and survival.			"

												Overall a great game, but admittedly isn't for everyone: - Takes a lot of grinding to progress anywhere but is very rewarding. - Great for roleplaying but some of the community can get too in to it. - Servers don't last for long but makes it more turbulent and fun whilst it lasts.Would highly recommend checking out some videos to see if you like it before buying.(I still absolutely adore this game)			"

												+Physics based combat that affects melee, ranged, and even siege weapons!+Great graphics. Some graphics glitches currently however.+Morality system that discourages killing pretty decently so that issues like ""bandits"" in DayZ are less common. Or at least less lethal =P+Mostly good interface. (Which you can customize to your liking pretty extensively.)+Most realistic medieval ""life"" game I have ever seen in my entire life. Every aspect of it is realistic in terms of difficulty.-+The realism makes this game hard to play alone, it's very community-based, but playing alone CAN be a viable option. Keep this in mind if the game interests you.+Fully sandbox. Build, do, or don't! The world is there to be shaped and molded by you! From the terraforming, to the building, to the ruins of villages you've left in your wake.+Can build a band of mercenaries, a friendly village, or a mighty kingdom.+Every skill has its importance in the creation and maintenence of a town. Making any choice of ""career"" viable and rewarding.In its current state I'd give this an 8.5/10. Definitely worth a try if you like building, medieval times, or kingdom ruling.			"

												TLDR: The game is Great. Give it a shot, but only if it's the type of game you really want to be playing, do some research, and don't expect something it's not.Life is Feudal is a fantastic game, if you understand what you are going to be playing.  You can tell from the reviews that many people enter this world expecting a survival experience or something they can play solo.  That's just not the case, and don't buy this if that is what you are looking for.  Unless you have a large group (6-10 active people is awesome) progress is slooowwww... and you can play it with less, but you have to exhibit some patience and find some people to enjoy the grind with. The game is mostly about building and being a part of the community, whether that means being a bandit, farmer, knight, or peasant.  This game is going to bore the ever-loving-hell out of most people if you can't find a way to socialize at least a bit.  Get to know your neighbors, do some trading and a bit of role-play, and work your way into a bit of conflict while you build yourself up, and you'll find the true LiF experience.PvP is prevalent, and is the main focus for some.  This can be quite frustrating for those that want to enjoy a peaceful life in-game, and are not used to dying in the games they play.  However, what you'll need to learn is that dying is nothing to fear.  Just be smart and don't keep your best gear on you while laboring, and the times you may die now and again shouldn't bother you in the least.Combat is fun, but takes some getting used to.  Similar to the Mount and Blade series, and War of the Roses for those that know those, but quite a bit less fluid at times.  Nonetheless, once you get the hang of it, a good scrap will always be interesting.City/castle building is where this game shines in my opinion.  You can make some pretty impressive and cool looking stuff if you have the mind to do it, and patience to complete it.  If you are just starting out, remember to start small, if you get too ambitious with your builds, you will quickly find that you will never finish and most likely burn yourself out.The UI is bad, but gets better/easier to use as you grow accustomed to it.Basically, LiF has been in and out of my life for a great deal of time during the period that I have owned it, and I woudn't trade my many hours in it for anything.  I've met a good deal of great people who I have continued to game with until this day.   "

												In five days I logged 50 hours.... I had to work two of them. This game has absolutely blown my mind. It has everthing you want out of an MMO, everything you want out of a fighting game, and everything out of a casual sandbox. Imagine Mincraft meet WoW meets....Well i personally don't fplay much fighting games so *insert here your favorite fighting game*. The mechanics of this game are easy to grasp and just as easy to master. The only thing that I could say is something of a drawback is that it becomes TOO realistic. I spent at least a day and a half, real world time, just moving dirt to create a beautiful and scenic home for myself. But, even though this could be a drawback, it also makes every little achievement more meaningful. I was basically talking to myself, congratulating, on completing a forge and anvil building for the first time. One of many more that I eventually built.			"

												at first i wasnt too sure about this game. playing alone is next to impossible unless you have god powers also known as GM mode in game. i gave the game a second chance and luckily landed in a server with someone who taught me the game. It has become very enjoyable. i do wish the servers would become more populated but that will come in time. I will recommend this game to someone who enjoys crafting. because you will be doing alot of it. it takes time to get up and going but its worth it when you look at a small village you and some friends have built and knowing you started with a clearing (or if you did as i helped other players with) an unlevled forest that you have to tediously chop down. this is definetly a game you will be in the long haul for.  Do not purchase if you want a casual jump in jump out type of game because you wont get anywhere in it. this is my two cents.			"

								This game 'Life is Feudal' really makes you question your life. Personally, the only laugh I got out of this game, is because of how bad it is. This game is nowhere near finished, you cannot do anything in this game but lag unless you have a super computer. I'd rate this game 2/10, I'm giving it 2 instead of 1 because of the banter it creates because you realise how much money you've wasted. I literally just got an achievement and the game isn't even open.			"

												EDIT: Haven't looked at this review in awhile, I decided to go back and look at it to evalutate how accurate is in now that the review is a year+ old. I decided it's not even worth changing because everything is pretty much still persistant as it was when I wrote it and also I noticed what I once thought was a 'fanboy' or maybe a server owner/admin is actually a DEVELOPER. So obviously they had people creating low level, private accounts to argue with critics about their game and to downvote negative reviews. This makes me question to validity of their postive reviews, which were a much higher precentage when the game was release on steam. Now the reviews are mixed and some light in finally being shed on these shoddy developers.. but too late as a lot of people have purchased this game due to bias.One perpetrator 'Neolog' had battled my opinions of the game, trying to be underhanded.. unfortunately I deleted most the comments he made because of his attitude. He wasn't a Developer when he was doing this criticism.. so not only did I receive an official response from Saxxon.. he has his little henchmen going around and debating peoples reviews, be warned if you are looking at the upvotes/downvotes for reviews, as they are obviously manipulated.Quote from the comments of my review:""Neolog  [developer] Dec 9, 2014 @ 12:37am  DeleteI dare to add my comment, hope you won't feel bad:-The graphics are pretty horrible (Think Asheron's Call with some realistic photo textures for SOME things, ick)Well, it's open world game with full terramorphing. You wouldn't say, that bad graphics is a CON of Minecraft, would you?-Many have problems getting it to load and be stable-A lot of strange lag and bugsAlpha, EA. You can copypast this comments to any EA game, and they'd still be true.-It's over 3 years old and still early accessIt's been early access for couple of months. Development took almost 3 years, sooooo? It's indie, dude, they don't have 2000 developers to release a game per year.-Lack of end game contentThe fact, that you're using ""end-game content"" for a sandbox game tells much about your understanding of a sandbox concept.I honestly don't understand why you bought this game in the first place, but given your quantity of bought games, it seems like you're just buying every game you see =)""End quote...of course he isn't being blatantly rude or anything in this comment, though he is obviously trying to incite a response that will make me - the reviewer, seem less credible.. the other posts he made, which I had deleted spiraled downward into near trollism.My orginal review:This game has potential, yes, potential. It's an evil word that is thrown about and often the ones who spring forty dollars on a game are quick to adopt it.It's fun to play, for sure, especially when there are more people working in sync to alleviate the artificial wait times. The wait times are a mix of a blessing and a curse, they give the feeling of accomplishment when you are finally able to see your hard work pay off, but this is all a ruse when you realize that there isn't really an end to a means since the endgame comes down to pvp which is still a work in progress and from my experience a long ways from being substantial. (I.E. Horses and almost all the weapon skills are not implemented.)The real reason I am NOT recommending this game is the lack of updates. YES I KNOW THIS IS EARLY ACCESS. They have been working on this game for over THREE YEARS before it got greenlit, Do yourself a favor and research it yourself, their PR will gladly say that they are working diligently on the game, but the fact is there hasn't been any substatial updates for years. That is not a good track record, especially concerning the core mechanics of the game which are not even implemented.PROS-Combat is not like Mount and Blade-Crafting system is detailed and involving-Fun to work with others towards a common goal-Open charachter development-Open world developmentCONS-Combat is not like Mount and Blade (Yes, it's a pro and a con)-Artificial wait times-The graphics are pretty horrible (Think Asheron's Call with some realistic photo textures for SOME things, ick)-Many have problems getting it to load and be stable-A lot of strange lag and bugs-It's over 3 years old and still early access-Lack of end game content-Not much freedom when constructing things (Prefab building, etc)I suggest you read over their official website, especially concerning their progress before you purchase, I also recommend researching other games that are close in genre and half as expensive.5/10			"

								Short version: In the version published as of 21st of September 2014, this game is too buggy for me to recommend. As they are getting fixed, this review will be updated. (Assuming I remember.)From what little I have played, this game is quite enjoyable. Only played by myself for now, to learn basics. It can be a bit hard to get into at first, in regards of how to control your character etc, but once you get the hang of the basics you're set. LiF has it's issues, but that is to be expected in an early access game, and will hopefully be fixed quickly. This game has a lot of potential, and down the line, if it's not abandoned, I can see it possibly be very popular. My best comparison would probably be a mix of Mount&Blade and Minecraft.			"

								I do not recommend this game, because it can actually be very fun. Odd reason to not recommend a game right! See the problem is... Enjoying it means obnoxious lenghts of time doing things. Oh want to make a farm, clear an area, teraform area, plow the ground, plant seeds, and harvest crops! Sounds easy, but each step is its own huge grind. On top of that, crops take (usually, but depending on server settings) a real life 24 hours to be able to harvest them. Worse yet if you arent online when they are harvestable, they wither. Fighting is fun enough, its laggy and glitchy but fun. It feels like a bad connection mount and blade, but dumbed down extremely. The hit detection is off, but not too bad. Combat is absolutely just spam click, however some things like shield bash knock you over and stun you. You can chain this with multiple people. The combat needs a lot of work, its geared for bad players in droves.Its also not really a solo game, you must find a group. Now several people will argue this, but understand that these are adults who can commit 10+ hours a day to a video game. Are you able to do that? Exactly, me either because we arent shut ins. The game takes huge huge gaps of time, splitting the time load with other players is the only way to survive. Unless you play on a PvE server I guess, but I cant imagine doing that.It was extremely fun for 4 or 5 days, playing with 3 RL buddies, then it kept getting more and more lame. Building weapons and armor takes REAL LIFE gaps if time. Like 24 hours for flax to grow, then 24 more hours to turn it into rope fibers... Oops not enough to make a full rope, 24 more hours to grow more, 24 more hours to turn that into rope fibers. I wish this was an exaggeration, but this will happen to you. You have outrageous time sinks to get skills to the level to do the next thing, like plant certain seeds, make rope or tan leather. All the while there is inevitably some huge 20 person group of euros who is pretending they are back in their countries hayday, griefing everyone mostly when they are offline. Its so weird and socially awkward.Short story long... Its just simply not ready yet, its a fun little medieval simulator, but im not willing to grind on an alpha game, maybe you are who knows. Try it, its not the worst game ever, its just currently a hot mess.			"

												Man..where top begin:When I bought this game, I fell in love immediately. No zombies, no spaceships, nothing to pull you out of feeling totally immersed in a dark-ages survival experience. Things were rough in the dark ages. They were DARK. The game follows suit. It was nigh unplayable solo. It has only gotten harder in my opinion. You need a group to survive unless you have 24/7 to grind away on things.The game play is great. Targeting is real..not tab BS. They got SO MANY THINGS RIGHT. Damned fine work guys!!! A+ in many many categories.Realistic? Hell yes. Too much so, though I think.A game has to be FUN. I find it relaxing as all get out to flatten the land and plant crops solo. But I have taken a massive short cut and created my own server, The Shadowlands, and allowed GM console commands for myself.This both made the game playable solo for me and it has now ruined it for me as it did with ARK: SEOnce you are GOD, what's left to strive for?Now there is an MMO version out. Initially I thought ""OUSTANDING""!! A persistant world where the rules aren't dictated by some drunken numbnut. I shall no longer plant my fields alone.....Then I found out that those of us who had already shelled out $40 bucks were going to have to PAY for said MMO.Whoa whoa...what?We have essentially paid to play what has effectively been a testing ground all along for this MMO. This game was never meant to be a standalone .. I see that now.Give the MMO to those who already paid for your R & D. Don't be THOSE guys who milkmilkmilk until we freakfreakfreak.That's my advice.Do I recommend this game? Sure...its amazing. Just bring friends or spend a day finding a non douchbag polluted server. They exist...in theory. But our current situation leads me to questions of integrity. I still hold my thumb up but it is leaning....			"

												The best game I've played in a long time, and about the only title of hundreds that didn't make me quit the game after a short while because I've went ""*sigh* I've done this before."" It's a realistic medieval sim, and a very time-demanding, rewarding one at that. It takes time to do stuff in the game, which has this amazing rewarding feeling when you actually accomplish things. Games nowadays have lost that feel. The game has quite a steep learning curve, and to even be able to kill a creature for its meat and pelt, it might take fifteen to twenty minutes killing it. But when you finally hit your target with that last stone and it falls to its death, I caught myself in jumping up and down in my chair, singing random celebratory songs! Amazing feeling. Many people would dislike this game. It takes time, and it IS hard. You'd have to like challenges to like the game. I've seen many people rate this game poorly, stating the reason behind it was that it was too hard and time demanding, criticizing it for not being like other survival games before it. I say thumbs up! Best game I've played in many, many years.			"

								I honestly think that a lot of the negative reviews towards this game were written without considering the game's spiritual predecessors: Wurm Online, Haven & Hearth, and whichever others gave way to inspire the mechanics in LiF. This game maintains the same level of grind as Wurm, assuming a 1.0 skillgain multiplier, while making every last accomplishment feel wonderful. When I got my first tunnel dug to ore, it was a great feeling, and then smelting the ore, and so on.The only agonies I face in this game really come from trying to play solo, terraforming (even with other people I imagine it's dreadful to flatten out a cliff face, as it really should be.) the occasional bug and probably loss of life and items from PvP encounters. I don't quite appreciate the way the skills work, with the prerequisite skills and all that, due to the fact that A: there's a(n) (adjustable) skillcap, and B: some of the sequencing doesn't make sense. IIRC, use of chainmail is restricted to after you reach level 30 in warhorse training, and other armor skills are thrown after other random combat skills. It just doesn't feel right. Lastly, if you're playing alone, just absolutely forget about making real progression with the skillcap at its default settings, because nearly every skill is required to make a nicely functioning settlement.Is this game worth the price tag? That's debatable. At this state, I'd personally say yeah, but I understand others that aren't as seasoned to the type of game this is might want to hold out for a sale or for more content to be ironed out and implemented. At the time of writing I've had ~40 hours in the past few days, and I've got to say, nothing feels more satisfying than seeing what all I've managed to accomplish on my own.			"

								Well , my first review. Have to say if you are interested in games where you need to work together with 3 or more people. Where you can feel the accomplishement of your campfire in the clearing becoming a pallisade box. Then the work and time to create your first stone keep. This game is for you. If you enjoy those things listed along with tedious skill up and horrible combat hitboxes and mechanics. Again this games for you. If you REALLY enjoy logging out after  a hard days grind to log in later and find out some asshat has put 3 logs floating in air to scale your walls and steal your stuff. This games for you. Catering to different playstyles and multitudes of servers with solo to group friendly skill rates and motifs, this games early access is actually worth it. The environment is nice. In general the players are not but you can make good friends none the less. Or worse comes to worse. Get killed by a naked bald man with a hatchet. The only drawback i get is 90% of the game at the moment is the levelling up of skills. Once you have the keep/warehouse/house/walls you are stuck to the grind. Or you can run out and cause mayhem with banditry or War. In general its a good start, and a novel concept. Lot of work to come but worth it if you enjoy the era it delivers and the fun it gives.Killed by a man with a giant wooden shovel.10/10 "

												I initially wrote the following in response to a post on the community page about why people dislike the game:It gets bad reviews because it is bad. The devs are EXTREMELY slow in getting updates out. There are lots of gamebreaking bugs. (gotta love tubs and racks still not working) Performance is still pretty poor for lots of folks. Good servers are hard to come by as they are community ran. Good servers fill up and you can't get in due to 64 person limit. The animal AI is atrocious. Its not a survival game because its insanely easy to find some apples. Fighting is rather counter-intuitive and if you don't like it its only because 'you aren't any good' which really just means you haven't taken the time to learn how to exploit certain weapons. The MMO can solve some of these issues, but first it actually has to get out of beta wave 0 which its been in for what, 6 months now? Not to mention the low skill cap and low skill multiplier make it a total grind fest. They announced that partnership with the microtransaction company like it was some crowning achievement which means milking us for every penny seems to be highest on the priority list. The concept of clans battling on some neutral outside the world battlefield also seems insanely stupid as well. I have nearly 1000 hours in the game and regret most all of them. If it wasn't for my addictive personality and the crafting system I would have given up much sooner. The one positive is that I can write reviews without the trolls complaining that I don't have enough game hours to have an opinion.			"

								Heres the real issue.  They make it hard and tedious for characters that could be wiped in a game full of bugsThis game is WAY to slow to be fun.  idk why watching a green bar would be conidered fun ever...  You need tons of stupid things like branches and fiber to build simple items.  Also if you joing the wrong server your skills are slow as hell. This is just a huge IMMATURITY and INSECURITY from the devs.  Trying to press people into playing grinds instead of why people joined this game in the first place.  One examples is making 4 traps (which take hours to get chickens, if you are lucky) takes 40 fiber to contruct (plus the apples \ branches).  Idk what the time is 4 secons for that damn green bar?  Just hitting the ground.. skill \ equipment \ area doesn't affect anything but quality (which is random, indiscernible from every other patch of woods)So 40 patches of grass *4 seconds = 160s plus the time clicking through their ultra clunky menu to get grass again.  Which also runs your skill cap ragged... you know so you CAN'T get to the things you wanted to do when joining.  Not bad right?  So I did it...  then 10 branches to get .7 out of 30 skill needed to build YOUR FIRST HOUSE...  not to mention leveling ground.  Time wasted =  10 branches x 4s x 42 (28 minutes).  Which tbh would be fine...  IF I WASNT FORCED TO WATCH AND CLICK THE ENTIRE ♥♥♥♥ING TIME			"

												TL;DR AT THE BOTTOMLife is Feudal is an extremely grindy game (on non-boosted servers at least). If you can handle the grind, however, it has to be one of the most rewarding, fun, and interesting games out there. It puts other medieval survival games (looking at you, Reign of Kings) to shame. Still very unfinished but, in my opinion, it is definitely worth the money.Pros:- The game is very rewarding later on. If you can get past the first difficult cliff then you'll be set for a while. It's not like Rust or Ark in that you can wake up one day with everything gone.- If you have a large group of friends it's a ton of fun. 10 friends in a group could create an entire empire if you work together.- Very in depth skills. You can level just about any skill you can think of.- Many, many paths to build your kingdom. If you want to build an underground kingdom, you can. If you'd rather a castle with massive, indestructible walls, you got it. There are infinite numbers of ways to play this game.- Roleplay potential is crazy. I don't mean roleplay like Skyrim where you level up skills and talk to NPCs. I mean roleplay like SAMP or Project Reality. If you want to get very immersed as the king you are, you certainly can. Check out Mr Moon on YouTube for good examples of Life is Feudal roleplay.Neutral- Takes a ton of time to get into. You can put 50 hours into the game without getting anywhere if you swap servers frequently. On games such as Rust, you can get a decent establishment up and running within a day. On Life is Feudal, you need a good 5-6 hours of gameplay for 5 days straight to get something resembling a base.Cons- The combat is still pretty meh. It was significantly worse when the game was launched. It's not as good as other medieval combat in games such as Chivalry, but it gets the job done.- Weird protection systems. In order to protect your items you must make some kind of totem/idol thing and give it frequent sacrifices of herbs. It takes 1-1.5 hours of farming in the first place to make it however if you miss one day of sacrifices then it gets destroyed and your stuff is gone.- Playing solo is impossible. Well, not technically, but you can't expect to get anywhere in any reasonable amount of time if you dont have a few friends to help you out. Hell, at least one friend will make a huge different.Please note that quite a few of my personal issues with the game (time investment, mainly) is made null by servers with increased farming rates.I will edit this review with more pros/cons as I play the game more.TL;DR - The game is very in depth, tons of fun, and very time consuming. Bring your friends. If you don't have a lot of free time play on an increased rates server. Over all, I'd give it a 8/10 based on my personal enjoyment.			"

												The best game I've played in a long time, and about the only title of hundreds that didn't make me quit the game after a short while because I've went ""*sigh* I've done this before."" It's a realistic medieval sim, and a very time-demanding, rewarding one at that. It takes time to do stuff in the game, which has this amazing rewarding feeling when you actually accomplish things. Games nowadays have lost that feel. The game has quite a steep learning curve, and to even be able to kill a creature for its meat and pelt, it might take fifteen to twenty minutes killing it. But when you finally hit your target with that last stone and it falls to its death, I caught myself in jumping up and down in my chair, singing random celebratory songs! Amazing feeling. Many people would dislike this game. It takes time, and it IS hard. You'd have to like challenges to like the game. I've seen many people rate this game poorly, stating the reason behind it was that it was too hard and time demanding, criticizing it for not being like other survival games before it. I say thumbs up! Best game I've played in many, many years.			"

								The harshest, most horrific grind of a game of all time, took me 60 hours to build myself a small house, warehouse and assorted outbuildings at literally 10 fps. The amount of time it takes to gather sticks to build one piece of basic ♥♥♥♥ing fence is beyond mind numbing. This game should be called GO GREEN BAR as all you ever do is watch ♥♥♥♥ing green bars fill up for every action you take. Scratching at the ground like a dog just to try and find the necessary ingredients to make steel takes an absolute eternity, then you have to smelt the♥♥♥♥♥♥ then you have to watch the ♥♥♥♥ing green bar fill up another million times just to build the ♥♥♥♥ing warehouse. Plus the server I was playing on just randomly disappeared forever and deleted all my horrible low res stuff. If you like constantly hammering your head against walls in eye bleeding, jerky slow motion then this is the game for you... If you have any semblance of a life or any sense whatsoever... RUN, SAVE YOURSELF FROM THIS HORRENDOUS GRIND FEST... I may never get those 60 hours back.. but if this review saves just one person it will all have been worth it...			"

Early Access Review
								LiF is one of the games I've been playing since starting my break from a different game earlier this year so I'd like to share my views on LiF as well. Overall:As others have said, it will not be for everyone, and the MMO version (LiF) vs the private server version (LiF:YO) are two rather different beasts.  Having been in the alpha for LiF, the biggest difference between the MMO and personal server versions is simply the size of the map, the lack of the ""claims"" mechanic (think of this system as a combination deed and guild/nation mechanics in Wurm Online), and the server owner's ability to mod the server.  This includes going so far as to restructure the skill trees, the exp rates, recipe requirements, and even the animations/models, they just need to provide the modified client files for you to use. Map Size(s)Looking at map sizes, for the LiF:YO map, if you are familiar with Wurm Online, it is roughly the size of Cele and shaped like a mini-Indy (big mountain in the middle, various terrain types between the mountain and the waterline).  On the MMO map, the LiF:YO equates to about 1 map ""grid"" in size (map was something like 12-15 by the same if I remember correctly). Skill/Character ProgressionSkills are capped by server settings, which is an option the server owner can configure and can allow for your character to actually master all skills if the cap is set correctly.  There are a few servers with reduced skill gains very similar to Wurm's progression pacing, but again it is up to the server owner.Like UO, on servers with anything less than max skills set, you can choose to lock any skill you want to not progress/gain exp in that ""line"", you can choose to have a skill reduce if you hit cap.Crafting, ""General"", and Combat skills are all separate skill pools, so the cap applies to each pool separately.Stats are their own pool and have their own ""cap"" appliedCombatPVE and PVP use the same combat systemAttacks are modified by skill, the weapon used, and target's armorYou can target specific areas for different outcomesEndurance matters, different weapons and attacks have different endurance costs, and the armor you're wearing adds to this cost.Different armors have different endurance costs, but also have strong/weak protection stats making a situational need/use for all armors (i.e. there is no best armor for every use where padding can be just as valuable as plate, sometimes more so, depending on who is using it and why)You don't have to kill your opponent to defeat them and you still get to loot themDeath system applies a small skill loss upon death (not defeat), which can be a larger or smaller impact depending on the server settingsTrade/CommerceIn the personal servers, since there are no kingdoms, there are no coin of the realm.  Each group is free to determine what they want to use as their basis of exchange.In the MMO plans (as per the FAQ) each 1*1km kingdom will have a ""pool"" of coin introduced by way of the trader posts (think of the trader system in Wurm)Building/Construction/StructuresGeneral housing/structures are templates (i.e. cookie cutter), but you can rotate the structure when placing it to provide at least some control on appearanceCastles/Cities are modular and built item by itemThe requirements for each structure vary greatly, and will require a player to learn/use a couple different skills to build even the smallest/easiest houseModsI've actually been playing mostly on a modded server for the last few days, the admin/modder has been keeping in-step with the developer and releasing updates the same day as the official client files.  Currently there are only 3 truly modded servers (actually requiring modded client files) accessible to the public.  Custom server configurations for exp gains, number of animals, etc... do not require modded client files*Updated* After having played on modded servers since the initial review, I continue to find that the modding community is full of very talented people.  The core system is not for the faint of heart, and these people not only keep their modded server (and client) files up to date almost in-step with the dev team, they tend to share their knowledge with others to improve everyone's gameplay experience by adjusting those elements important to their server's players. Personal Opinion(s)Honestly, I'm enjoying LiF about as much as I when I started playing Wurm full time a couple of years ago.  Like Wurm Online a few years ago, there are a lot of things that are still in the early development process, and more than a few things that are just fun when taken as part of the overall system.  To me, it really does feel like Wurm Online back when Golden Valley (GV) was the starter town and the mainland was premium only. The two biggest things that I think players coming from games like Wurm Online specifically need to keep in mind is that in LiF:YO there is a built in need to interact with people unless the server has the skill cap set high enough (3000+ skill points), and there is a progression dependency to all skill progression.  If you want to build castles, you need to learn to terraform->refine construction materials->construction->masonry->architecture, you cannot simply jump into one skill to hit the next skill unlock and then forget about the base skill. As with any other game, you'll either like it or you won't, but either way, it's a personal opinion/preference that only you can decide on.			"

Title: Life is Feudal: Your OwnGenre: Action, Indie, RPG, Simulation, Early AccessDeveloper: Bitbox Ltd. Publisher: Bitbox Ltd.“Realistic medieval multiplayer sandbox with terraforming, free preset and modular building construction, rich crafting (smelting, forging, farming, animals breeding etc.), survival, no target physics based combat, original combat formation system and numerous other features.”**Do note that this is an Early Access game, things will still change.**Overall Experience:My first impression when I tried the game is that the way the game is presented is very good. It's set in a medieval environment, your character starts off in a woodland area, the land is a mix of untamed forests, grass and water. The buildings and tools represent this era very well, a lot of effort has gone into the background. I like the realism behind the crafting system too, like if you go to fish, you won't always catch a fish. It's relaxing as well when you're not getting attacked every five seconds by the wildlife, which gives you time to do things. The game starts off with you having to explore, forage and prospect the land to find and gather materials. From these materials you craft primitive items that allow you to fish, chop trees, dig for ore, and from then on you can choose what you want to specialise in as well. There is a limited number of points you can pour your points into, which means you will end up focusing on one or two skills more than the others. For example you may choose to build a farm, and learn to cook and tend to animals. Or maybe you want to learn how to build a house and design it with different architectural styles. Perhaps you want to create potions. Or learn to forge armour and weapons. So you choose to focus on the desired skill tree until you are able to make the higher end materials. This is good because with each player specialising in an skill tree, it means there is more chance of cooperation happening, for players contributing to build a village or a working clan, rather than running around killing people straight away. You can adjust the max learning points from server to server, but limiting it persuades people to work together for the greater good. Gameplay: This is one of the things that lacks, and I feel the need to say it. The learning curve in my opinion is really hard, and it's difficult to get into the game if you don't have any friends that play it, who can help you to learn it. I liked the fact that the game requires you to be patient. It's not the kind of game where you can mindlessly run around and get everything you need in less than an hour. It's the kind of game that will require a lot of time for you to be able to get even some of the things you need. It's a slow paced game, but things are sped up when you do it with people - which means once again the game is encouraging cooperation.Controls: The controls are ok, but the main problem is that you need to tab for virtually everything, which gets pretty annoying. I would prefer the viewing and gathering to be different than needing to tab for it each time. The screen freezes with wherever you tabbed so there isn't much free roaming/observing. The movement of the character is good and quite smooth, but the rest is clunky. Sound: I really liked the music in the game. The game is very slow paced, and the music fits in perfectly in the background, nice and relaxing for something that you will end up spending a lot of time on. It changes when you go into combat as well. Learning Curve:I think the learning curve is really hard, and this needs to be mentioned for players who may not have so much patience with this. There's a lot of things you need to do, with your inventory you need to point and click for everything, and each action takes time to process. With the character creation menu as well there is no explanation of the skills you'll be putting your points into, which is a shame because these will affect the outcome of what you do in the game. For example one of the skill trees just says ""Forestry"", but with no detail as to what this means. What will forestry allow you to do and craft and how you can do it within the game. This would benefit enormously from having a small description underneath for each skill and talent. Verdict: The game itself has a LOT of potential. The game is well detailed, and the crafting system is very in depth and gives you a lot of options. However the game will take a long time to learn - it isn't for anyone who doesn't have the patience to keep at something. 6.5/10Why 6.5? Because this game has potential, however it has not reached the potential I think it can. But then again that is what Early Access is for.Want moar?

								Dont let the ""Mixed"" review status fool you, im sure most of those people were expecting more Reign of Kings.There is ALOT of grinding in this game and it will throw alot of people off. Its not for the deathmatch crowd.The way i picture it is in Warcraft you need to lvl until cap then play the game, In this you spend that time leveling your proffessions and or your combat skills then play the game.Althought ive been in a few fights or side destractions while leveling.You need to practice and traing your character skills to get the certain benifits, even with that you need to know how to fight with a mount and blade style. The health system is much more indepth and realistic. If someone plunges a sword in your chest you will start to bleed out unless you treat it,  If you get headshotted your bonned. Not all fights you will go into the opponent or yourself will be at 100% you or he may be wounded from a fight from hours ago or still recovering from getting beaten by wooden swords to be more profficient with that class or armor.You'll need to pick a trade and grind it out until youve master it, and you cant master all of them to trading is important.there too much to mention and its still early access.If you want to be play casual play Reign, If you want to really earn what you get and play something more realistic buy this game!

								Seeing as I have 500+ hours and this game is about to release I should put my opinions and experiences out thereWe'll begin with the learning curve of the game. Personally, it took me and a few friends a week or two to actually get into the ""mid-game"" of Life Is Feudal. Through lots of struggling and crashes we eventually became the strongest and best on the server, we were addicted. For new players, this game is extremely difficult but very immersive. I can not stress enough to new players to push through the beginning grind so they can experience the rest of the game. I feel as if more stuff should be added to the beginning of the game to make it more fun for newer players, however.The skills tree is very well thought out, however it features some bottlenecks that must be overcome. I very rarely say this, but I enjoy how this game forces you to play with friends to make the game a little easier. In saying this, roles come into play. Whenever we play, we usually designate a farmer, blacksmith and builder, as these are the roles needed to quickly surpass the early game. I almost always play the farming role at the start as I enjoy seeing how a few seeds that you scraped up from the ground begin to become a vast farm that surrounds your town. Most of the other skill trees in the game also flourish in a similiar way, such as going from constructing chicken coops and shacks to beautiful multi-story houses and towering walls.During our time in Life Is Feudal, we rather quickly noticed the older aged community. We made many friends with people 20 or even 30 years older than us. The only major problem we had with the community was that some of the older folks (a lot, actually) disliked PvP and stuck to strictly PvE. This anti-PvP community here in Australia at least is quite worrying for the future of the game, as removing one of the main elements to a game like this makes it ever more boring. My group and I all enjoyed the threat of having some armed dudes try and take us down because they were worried that we would become powerful, and it would be great if one day we came across a server that didn't shun it. On the topic of PvP, the weapons and fighting in the game have come a far way, however I hope they do fix some little things in time for the MMO to avoid♥♥♥♥♥♥♥running about with no armor and bows just to get some easier kills.Overall I look forward to the MMO and would recommend that you buy this game when it goes on sale for the release, and remember, life is feudal..

								Is this game worth 40 dollars? No. Not quite, will it be? Yes, without a doubt. This game is very addicting, it is so fun, you will wonder why you find it so fun; and consider that something may be wrong with you. Primarily because you stare at things for hours on end.First you look at grass, then trees, then ground that you flatten, then you look at ground you are digging into, then you look at ore you are mining, then the furnace you are smelting it in, then the leather crafting equipment, then the forge, and finally; you look at people running away from you, before you catch up to them and kill them with weapons and armor.11/10 Would fail to communicate with peasant thief because of Alpha Build, then kill him and take all his rocks, rags and apples.EDIT - There seems to be a LOT of confusion about combat in this game, rightfully so. People say it is broken because they attempt PVP VERY EARLY INTO THEIR PLAYTHROUGHS, and try to beat each other to death with tools mostly, iron and primitive.However, that is not true, you take a major penalty when fighting with tools that can be reduced (Although never fully) by leveling a skill called ""Militia Service,"" which attaches to a penalty free weapon, the familiar pitchfork! The pitchfork is effective, as you are unarmored and agile, you can also outmaneuver them with your speed. A peasant not to be trifled with to say the least.Additionally, ""real"" combat features a not visually impressive, but still very immersive and fun combat system. You will find yourself strategizing against your opponent, anticipating his moves and stamina, spotting weak points in his armor. You will want to duel your cohorts almost constantly, when facing Hank, the fully armored Zweihander♥♥♥♥♥♥victim in the comments. I found myself circling with him in a defensive posture and thinking, ""First, he'll aim to parry, strike, backpedal and swing, then disengage and recover."" You will feel A LOT of satisfaction when your opponent executes precisely as you anticipated before you press the attack. It will drive you to almost never want to make things in the game again, only steal and kill from those who do.			"

								The concept of the game is very unique and has a very in depth crafting system. There are some bugs but nothing game breaking and some of the stuff is yet to be implemented but devs are working on it. Its very slow paced game so if you like that kind of game then there isn't any better and ofcourse this is kind of a demo version of the real MMO that the devs will make after based on this one after they perfected it. And its kinda good deal since if you buy this one you get one free character on the MMO version when it gets released meaning you get both games for single price			"

But the crafting is amazing, the graphics are neat and the combat needs tweaking here and there but I've been in some pretty fun fights. You're never truly safe behind your walls as there are always those players who enjoy raiding a little too much but if you put up a fight they tend to back off a bit, but if you don't fight back you'll probably be bullied so don't be a carebear for your own sake.The game is what you make of it and I highly recommend this game to all my friends and anyone who reads this review.

												I always thought Life is Feudal looked pretty crappy and seemed like a bad game with a terrible UI where you walk around with big tree-trunks on your back and hunt for invisible ingredients off of the ground and trees...While some of it is actually still true (harvesting of ingredients and carrying things on your back - though the tools look much better now), the upgraded graphics, new weather and season changes, etc. has made this into something utterly different from what I first perceived. If you've ever wanted to build your own house and live a simple life, where all your necessities come from nature and your own hard work, this is the game you've been looking for. - If nothing else, you can simply take in the beauty of the living nature with many different species of trees and wildlife co-existing in a world that's (yet) to be touched by human influence.P.S. Sean Bean made me buy this game.			"

								I really enjoyed learning and testing Life is Feudal: Your Own. Even though it's current content is limited, this game has absolutely AMAZING potential. The concept is truly awesome. However, there are some pretty serious issues with the game. Aside from exploiters and trolls, the engine the game runs on is utterly terrible. The engine cannot currently support 64 people (or even 20 very active players) without a substantial amount of serverside lag. This isn't something that can be fixed. It has to do with a memory limitation of the 32 bit process that the engine uses. Until they remake the game on another engine, an MMO with 10,000 people per world will be entirely unplayable (no matter how much they break up the world into individual areas with their own server).Secondly, the combat system, while very interesting in concept, is horrible. I understand what the developers were going for, but what they designed is too clunky to be enjoyed. Lastly, the developers are doing an excellent job smashing bugs and fixing other errors. Even if they can fix the exploits and remaining game-breaking bugs, it is still difficult to recommend LiF:YO for $40. The server and engine issues cannot be fixed without using a different engine. The only exception would be if someone has ten to twenty friends to play with and are willing to wait a few months for more content.			"

								Ruthless and amazing medieval sandbox sim. But don't try to tackle the elements alone, this game is rather realistic in time consuming tasks and labour intensive work needed to get basic defences up. And you need them, for the pvp is really ruthless and amazing fun. You will die, your stuff will be stolen and you will feel sorry. But you will also have a great thrill. Don't get mad, get even. Learn to fight, make your attackers into walking porcupines with arrows hailing from your walls.

												Life is Feudal: Your Own is a very grueling, arduous, exausting game at first, it took me almost 15-20 hours of gameplay just to understand the BASICS (playing while listening to a youtube guide), and with more than 100h of gameplay i still doesn't know how to do ALOT of things ingame.Pros: Crazy variety of skills and its improvemants (artisan -> carpentry -> contruction -> masonry -> engineering/architecture | artisan -> mining -> smelting -> forging/armorsmithing/jewelry | nature's lore -> farming -> forestry -> advanced farming -> brewing/cooking/alchemy, etc etc) Outstanding medieval atmosphere, graphics plus soundtrack. Realistic Combat Theory, an audacious step by the devs, physics-inspired body control, special attacks following intuitive parry (the game even takes weapon's weight into account here) and blocking, combos and the legendary pounce to take the edge of a fencing battle, it's all there. Character progression is rewarding as anything, but it's a double-edged sword, cuz one of the things that makes that progression so rewarding is the constant feeling that you can lose everything upon death.Cons: This game is still in Early Access despite they took EA status away, unfinished in so many ways. Tiny variety of fauna and flora. Combat Theory is amazing but there's almost none opportunity to learn and improve it besides PvP (i tend to dislike PvP in survival games), cuz there's so few distinct wild animals (wolfs, boars and bears for the most part) which gets you bored/tired easily. Annoying character movement overall at first, but you get used to it. Almost none interaction with other players besides PvP and ""crafting together"". Death Penalty is the only thing that keeps me away from this game (normally i find this a pro but since i don't have much free time nowadays).Concluding Remarks:I often compare Life is Feudal with Wurm Online/Wurm Unlimited, they are almost the same game with the big difference of graphics ofc, same essence, but it's like you have much more purpose in investing time in Wurm, very few itens to craft overall in comparison, because of limited fauna you don't have much variety in the Animal Lore skill-tree (catch, breed and tame animals), because of limited flora you don't have much variety in the Nature's Lore skill-tree (herbalism, forestry, farming and alchemy), the list goes on and on in almost every aspect of the game, as i said LiF is still an Early Access game in my opinion.Finally, i would say LiF:YO is a game for people who have time to invest, because it's a very time-consuming game and it's learning curve is kinda grueling, and i must say (even that i know i'm giving a thumbs up) don't buy this game YET, let it improve, i would recommend you to buy Wurm Unlimited here (on a sale haha) to get used to this type of game, if you ""master"" Wurm Unlimited by the time you play LiF, it wouldn't be that time-consuming.

								Definately a great game in it's current state already :)I often compare it to Minecraft. I know that comparisation is overused, but in the case of Life is Feudal it's not too far away. I remember my friends and me talking about the ""downsides"" of Minecraft, and what we would want in a ""Minecraft 2"": More crafting, better engine, better graphics, some sort of a combat system other than LMB spam and again, more crafting.Life is Feudal pretty much is exactly that. It's not blocky at all and doesn't feat creepers, but that's it :PThe crafting variety is very large, the chains can be HUGE (Growing chickens to make dung to fertilize soil to grow flax to make fibres to make yarn to make ropes to make an arbalest etc). The price is high for an early access, but in my view it's worth it.HOWEVER the game is very slow paced, which actually is a good thing. Just keep this in mind when thinking about buying the game: If you only ""casually play a little"", LiF might be too time intensive for that.Also you need some kind of technological expertise when trying to play on your own. If you dont have it you should play on another server. ""Single player"" works fine  for a week but then usually crashes, leaving your save corrupted and you unable to play without setting it all up again (21.02.15). I hope this is a priority issue because I'm really tired of all the database work just to avoid that my savegames are gone ;)This kind of ""big"" issue still doesn't keep me from spending most of my time with this game, therefor I can only recommend it in all ways :P Not perfect, but going to be ;)			"

												The 1.1.7.4 update made everything worse, you now need linen to make most armors which is expensive as hell. Also, they now made it so you have to check your crops once every 10-12 hours which is insane when you acually have stuff to do in the real world. So I do not recommend this game to people who acually have lives.			"

												First: Ignore the negative reviews of players with less than 100h negativating over being attacked, because they don't have any experience in the game or are doing something wrong, it take some and you need some friends to know everything, players who try to play alone that barely can do it in High cap/progress servers, you can be attacked by groups and it can be really annoying to loners.Second: This game is slow, have it in mind, it isnt like rust where you set up you base in hours and wipes every month, you need time, pacience and people to play with you, doing everything alone is boring, so have some friends to chat and distract over the repetitive tasks. Third: For combat, it is like mount & blade, sort off... It's tricky to be a decent fighter, but if you play with friends, you can train your way to be a proficient fighter. Don't think this game can be played without combat, only with you want to play HappyFarm on a PvE server.  If you dont have too much time to play this game, no problem! You dont need to play all day, it is just important what you do while you play... lots of groups would like to have a extra pair of hands to help, even for just a few momments/day. And if you are buying this game to play the MMO when it releases, YOU MUST play this game AT LEAST ONCE in a LOW progress and LOW skillcap server, you need to be used to the grind. Play in a high progress to learn how to play but go in a low cap/progress and get used to it. ------ Mensagem especial para os brasileiros (ou portugueses que nao se importam com ping): Se você deseja jogar no MMO e não gosta de trolls e quer ter um grupo grande e amigavel, só me adicionar na steam ou procurar o grupo ""Meia Lua MMO"", jogaremos no servidor norte-americano.

Early Access Review
								Type of Game:First person or Third Person Multiplayer Medieval Survival Sandbox Open World SimulationVersion Played:Early Access PC version through SteamSimilar Games:DayZ, Rust, and to a lesser degree the Mount & Blade seriesThe Good:An epic game world filled to the brim with content, whether it be things to craft or items to use, the game world has no limits on what you can do.Everything you see is reachable and harvestable.A very strong medieval aesthetic, which makes the game stand out more so than the competition (i.e. DayZ, Rust, etc…).Multiplayer is this game’s strong suit with a great enjoyment to be had by exploring the medieval landscape with a buddy or two.The crafting, building, and surviving aspects of the game are much more exciting when experienced with a friendThere is a level progression system, which you typically won’t find in games of this nature.I only say this because a progression system is much more fun in a survival type game and brings with it a sense of urgency that you would find in a PDL genre-type.The map is always present, which usually isn’t the case for these games. This makes coordinating a rendezvous with your friends much easier and drastically improves the multiplayer experience. As you’ll find with other game’s of this type, the relationships with other players is a fascinating experience. For the most part other players typically pursue a Lord of the Flies mentality and will often exert their power over those that have a weak footing in the game’s hierarchy. However, when you encounter other players that are helpful it makes the game much easier to digest and enjoy.The Bad:Life is Feudal is very clunky and not polished at the moment. Menu and interface options aren’t intuitive and present themselves as overly complex. Complete lack of a tutorial, which is understandable for an “Early Access” title, but you should be aware none-the-less.Single-player is difficult to swallow as most other players will just grief you over and over again. Playing with your friends is the only way to currently guarantee a good time.Outside of the medieval aspects, this game is more of the same if you’ve played Rust or DayZ. I would argue that the features are much deeper than what Rust has to offer and Rust is Life is Feudal’s closest likeness.Can you play it while the children are awake?Due to the nature of multiplayer shenanigans, I often had to play without my sound on. Other players are often rude and mean, which can lead to profane language and crude lingo. There is also combat and violence, but I felt as though the graphics weren’t grand enough to matter in that regard. Did I make time to complete it?As a multiplayer game there is no completion per say. I did build a number of structures and survived for a number of hours.Redlight or Greenlight?This game is currently at a redlight.The content that is currently offered is just not worth the asking price of $39.99. If you were a gamer that REALLY enjoyed Rust, then you will be getting your money’s worth in this title as the content is better. Outside of that demographic, I just don’t see the appeal of paying a large amount of money to experience a lesson in human nature (i.e. griefing) and confusing gameplay (lack of tutorial). This may change as the game updates, so please check back here for any changes in my preview.Reviewer:MisterS42A Quick Look at Those Games You Might Buy:http://www.gamersglance.com "

								I really want to recommend this game.  As a longtime fan of open sandbox games going back to MUDs I love hardcore sandbox action.  However good the idea though, don't think this one is going to be the next Ultima Online or EvE:online sans spaceships. You can read alot about the gameplay and unfinished state, but really the developer is small and needs funds to make anything happen.  I won't knock that.  I for one was willing to invest a few dollars in the idea.  However upon playing for quite a long time it’s my honest opinion the game is structurally flawed.  Read that as I do not think their current engine and code is capable of being ported to an MMO framework and from what I have seen so far, I'm skeptical that it will even be stable as a Minecraft style dedicated server game - EVER. Many others have detailed problems so far, but I can say that this game currently (NOV2014) does not support most video cards and you will spend around 5-10 minutes loading into most servers only to have no sound and quite probably crash within 1 minute of dropping in.  This has something to do with the terraforming and other stuff I know nothing about. This is not the review I want to leave.  I love the idea.  Hope this company can make it happen, or another larger developer can buy it and make it what it should be.  There is a demand for hardcore sandbox action in this environment and as an MMO it can be profitable for decades, just look at the EVE:Online model that has thrived even with internet spaceships which turns alot of hardcore RPG'rs off.  But cannot recommend this game now and unlikely will for quite some time going forward. "

								Life is Feudal... indeed! The amount of time you can spend to build a single house is.... horrendeous. You need building logs? ok go chop trees, easy! you need windows? go melt some sand to make glass, easy! you need doors? even better, you can get wood planks from the trees you just chopped. A lock for the door? oh ok I'll just smelt some iron... wait it has to be steel? how the F do I do this?? oh you need Flux, a compound found in plants, and you can acces it via Herbalism skill. Wait I just reached my skill cap? oh jeez. I'm out of this game......Someone comes to help you build your village? They want to be a part of this? Great!! they get the flux then!This is an example of the complexity of the game and how dependent you have to other players. It might be scary for newbies but if you get into it with 2 or 3 friends, you can really achieve something marvelous, or at least so I have seen. Minecraft is for kids, Rust is for teens, LiF is for adults who want to achieve something.At your own risk.			"

												This is probably the most counterintuitive, addicting game I've ever had the chance to play. It's probably due to the amazing community I've found in the server I play in, because without the Wikia this game is nearly impossible.It's basically a life simulator. You spawn with nothing but your clothes and a piece of bread in your inventory and you climb the ladder from there. You learn as you go, gaining new skills as you work to build your refuge that could, with some effort, turn into a walled city. The PVE is fun and gratifying, frustrating at times but when you finally cut that last three and saw that last building log and see your house or warehouse or blacksmith workshop rise, it's great. The PVP is tough to master but it can be done. One good thing is that it runs smoothly even on older computers. It's a light-weight game, but it gets the job done very well, it's quite pleasing to the eye, expecially in spring and summer.			"

This game is very fun despite the grind that is required to play but you will put in alot of hours to comeplete simple tasks unless you play on a 8X skill progression server.  there arent any npcs in the game and your danger comes from other players and animals.  There are some bugs that people take advantage of that kind of ruined the experience for me like ""floating logs"" to jump into your base which negated my countless hours spent building the wall.

Build everything from huts to homes, to outposts and even villages. Or, if you’re feeling ambitious, you can create your own mega-castle! Work the land for natural resources, craft weapons and armor, and gain valuable player skills in order to stay alive. Life Is Feudal is an excellent game, it's in a early stage with obvious bugs but highly playable and already has a lot of content to offer.

Life is Feudal: Your Own is a incredibly interesting game, in particular in regards to gameplay and multiplayer. This is something personal, but in my eyes it is the most promising indie game for all of 2014 and the first half of 2015.However, everyone who is thinking about purchasing this game should weigh pro's and con's and decide for himself/herself if he/she really wants to have this game, since the complexity of some game mechanics and the large amount of time you need to devote to achieve a decent understanding of the game, probably scare a lot of people off only after a few minutes of playing the game.For those who absolutely adore games that need some time to get used to and to get started, this is for you. Unlike in a few other games, such as the infamous 'The Stomping Land', the building is not restricted to only a few buildings and objects, but it takes quite some time to reach the stage of actually constructing something big, so if you look for a game where you can build a castle within ten hours, then you are wrong with LiF:YO.I would also highly recommend only to play with a few friends, the more the better, as the unique skill system prevents one individual from learning all the skills that are out there, meaning that specializing on a skill tree (e.g. logging or terraforming), as the max cap of skill point will only be enough to absolutely maximize one skill tree.In general this game is great fun when you are with other people, but it is only a glimpse at the size and massiveness that LiF:MMO will bring in the third quarter of 2015.

Product received for free
												Okay, so my friend decided to gift me this game because we were moving from Reign of Kings to Life is Feudal and it was my birthday at the time. Let's start with the general idea of the game, you are living in a medieval era and you need to survive which will require making many friends and joining up with small to large factions. If you're wondering why you need to do this, it's because the game is so time consuming that you need multiple people to do certain things (this is a pro and con depending on how you look at it) it's rather realistic to a degree that you can't just cut down a tree and store 5000 wood in your inventory, you must carry the log back to where you are stationed and then cut it into what you need (logs, boards ect).The game has amazing seasons, it's changing from winter, summer, spring and autumn constantly which makes the game constantly feel refreshing and you'll get a kick out of playing in the snow with your medieval bretheren by making snowballs or snowmen (snowwomen for all you feminists). Each season lasts a pretty long time varying from 2-3 weeks in real life time, this is immersive and allows you to really get into the game and interact with other people. As far as I can tell, the roleplaying in this game is amazing and the people I'm currently playing with are awesome and took me into their guild when I was by myself. I'm currently roleplaying as a Herbalist who specializes in selling explosions and potions, and managed to my♥♥♥♥♥whooped by someone who calls themselves ""Witch of the Forest"" as she slaughtered tons of my men on her own.You're capable of taming, breeding and capturing animals which you can use for numerous things like Milk, Eggs ect and horses which you are able to ride into combat, or just in general to get around easier. I had a horse named Snow, I rode her into combat and then she vanished never to be seen again (clearly she was stolen because of her natural beauty) but no one is owning up to it, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Once you've managed to build your house, which is going to be stressful at first since it's kinda grindy (very on normal servers) you'll be able to actually build and put furniture inside which is part of the Carpentry skill I believe. You're also able to own shops, and perhaps even open up a trade route which other players will ride along in order to purchase your fine wares.You have no fall damage, this has to be addressed and while some may see it as a pro for how fun it can be to jump off mountains, it's really a con since it can kill immersion and really dull the mood a tad bit. Items don't seem to automatically stack sometimes, so you'll find yourself having to drag them onto each other in order to stack them up which is annoying. Sometimes you may find that you don't hit the target you're attacking, some think the hitbox is a little messy but this can be fixed by swinging just before you reach the target. You'll probably find yourself using a cart a lot since you'll be carrying large shipments of items from one place to another (from mining rocks and storing them in a cart to your base ect) and this'll be a tad annoying since it's rather slow, although you wouldn't see someone doing mach 10 while pulling a cart so just relax and try not to get annoyed by it. This game isn't supposed to be something where you build an empire in a day, it takes weeks upon weeks of gathering and interacting with other players so enjoy the experience and don't get too annoyed by the smaller things.Does this game have a friendly community? I've only played on one server, it's a big RP server and everyone on there is rather friendly assuming you are as well.Is this game worth buying? Indeed, you'll no doubt spend countless hours on this game If you have a love for survival games, roleplaying and medieval type games.WARNING:If you do not meet the minimum requirements for this game, chances are it won't allow you to start up so don't bother getting the game If you don't meet them. You'll be extremely disappointed.			"

Early Access Review
								Ignore all the bad reviews. People have no idea what they are talking about.1. Game developers are very active and interact with the community constantly.2. Each patch makes massive strides forward towards full release.3. The game mechanics are spot on. Gathering, crafting, mining and combat feels great.4. The game LOOKS and SOUNDS beautiful. This is quality.5. It takes me a minute to load into a game. People are not looking at server ping when connecting. It's not the game that sucks, it is their ISP.6. Learning curve is not steep -- game-play is very logical, just requires time and dedication.7. I can see this game being out of Early Access by the end of year for sure.I've spent MANY hours playing this game and can honestly say this is one of the best games on Steam. But, a lot of these negative reviews are coming from people who have no idea what they purchased. Here are a few helpful hints and tips about Life is Feudal: Your Own!1. Gather plant fibres from the ground. Useful flint front the mountains/hills, and branches from the trees.2. Craft primitive tools be right clicking on a branch. A primite shovel and axe and you are well on your way.3. Find a fairly flat piece of land and terraform just enough to build a little hut (4 x 4). Do this until your terraforming is at 60; then you can make a primitive pick-axe and use it to dig tunnels.4. This is not Minecraft.5. You can not enter a terrority that is claimed by someone else unless it is judgement hour.Buy this game. Especially now since it is on discount. WELL WORTH IT!!			"

								I strongly recommend this early alpha game to people who love to work with other players to build buildings, grow crops, blacksmithing etc .  Ignore the crashing whiners, many of those crashes were fixed in the sunday patch. Come to london 5 server, we have our own town called Moosetown SW on the main island where its boot shaped like italy.			"

								This game looks at awesome in the rear view mirror. A definite 10/10, especially considering the development status. I started playing with some friends right after the release and did not stop for 11 hours. Especially the terra forming and the crafting skill line work great. Just make sure to join some other people and work together.EDIT 09/30/14:About 120 hours into the game it's still keeping its promises. The possibilities are endless and I can't wait to experience the new content as it's being made available.My only advise: find some guys who share your idea of gaming experience. When you are the only one hwo's dreaming about building a castle while the rest of your group wants to battle each other, you'll probably spend your days shoveling dirt without big results. If there are 10 more like you, then you'll be urprised what can be achieved in a couple of hours.			"

												This game is basically living life as a medieval person. It involves doing some boring♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the grind can be a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ But after sitting at your desk for 12 hours, realizing you need to eat and hydrate in real life, you get the satisfying feeling of seeing your village slowly build due to the hard work you and a few friends have put into it. This game is one of the most rewarding and feudal games I have played, and you will become attached to the things you build. If you don't mind grinding a bit to get the things want done, this game is definitly for you. The next level of basically living life but not actually doing anything other than sit in front of your computer all day. I truly love this game.			"

												Great sand-box multiplayer game. With a overall great community and interesting and engaging building/ crafting mechanics. Easy to learn and very hard to master. If you like medieval times, and working for what you get I recommend this game. If you are the type of player that wants to run around killing people without putting any time in, I would recommend you look else were. Not to say your play style is not welcomed, but game mechanics make players wait days, and weeks before they can craft their first sword. After that you have to wait a few weeks before you can actually use any good gear. Simply put if you want things to be done instantaneous you will not enjoy this game. It is very slow paced, but personally I like that aspect.If you enjoy making friends, and working together with other people, or to role-play heavily then I would recommend this game. The game mechanics forces players to work together to create any mid to end game buildings or gear. All skill trades intersect with each other, and all of them need each other's help. Because of this set up you will have to group up or trade if you want to create end game gear.devs are very good about updates (even if they fall behind) and are constantly listening to feed back and improving the core mechanics. The game is a bit expensive but I believe that it is worth every dollar.Update after relise. Nothing much changed			"

Early Access Review
								The game is clearly still in early alpha but even so there are a lot of solid game mechanics. The multiplayer is what really makes this game, the ability to group up with friends on your own personal server and to then start your own little village is really fun.There are multiple professions for you to pick and choose from. The range from farming, to mining or to even hunting. If you can think of a profession that is vital to a Medieval village then, it is in there.There are a few headscratching moments like having to learn how to wear leather armour before being able to use a bow. I don't really understand that to be perfectly honest. If it wasn't for one of my friends being a tanner then I'd never be able to become a Archer.Overall, the game has a long way to go before it meets it's goal but with buying this game in early access, you're supporting the devs in reaching that goal.

												I have played this game since the original alpha-- and i gotta say its great and just gets better! It can be both exciting and relaxing in turns.

								I've never felt the urge to write a review but after purchasing this game it's quite necesarry. When you watch the demo videos like I did with my friends, you might think ""Damn! that looks really cool looks like a lot of content."" But upon installing the game and running it you'll realize you were the victim of false advertising. To Charge 39.99 for this Alpha is criminal, the game has barely any functioning content and still has a LONG WAY to go before it's really in a true Alpha. Wish I could honestly get a refund for this game, waste of money and a scam.			"

												>>>> To the Dev's , Please Cease & Desist in using the Your Own Game to Test Implements of the game that Rely heavily on Large Player bases which you intend on implementing in the MMO Version of the Game. You are Destroying a much better Game than the MMO can ever hope to become for a player base that will Never move to an MMO, but will instead leave your games altogether. Thanks.Game has some bugs, but otherwise the only real problems are the MMO addtions to the game that do not fit in with the smaller community of ""Your Own""  Those problems aside, The game is Incredible, and you should totally get it. If you like these kinds of games you will forget about all the other ones you used to play very quickly.			"

								So far it's great game that has a lot of potential if it gets fixed up a little more. Most content is not in the game yet as you can see on the devs roadmap, but they're getting there. Slowly. As of right now resources are exhaustible and performance is decreasing rapidly with more players and more customizations to the world. After you built your keep, walls and city and gotten your high-end quality equipment there isn't much to do other than bash someone elses face in. Which is fun a few times, but it get's repetetive real fast.As of right now I do not recommend it, if they bring more content into the game and increase performance drastically this might change to yes though. It does have potential.			"

Early Access Review
								For those too lazy to read my full review, this about sums it up:http://i1279.photobucket.com/albums/y532/aceskipper1/howlifreallyis_zps32bee31f.jpgThis game is increasingly difficult to review when you take into account certain factors that have affected it. Firstly, something I must of course say, the game is early-access alpha. It is still in development and so I appreaciate this and will not comment on the large amount of bugs and other ""early-access"" esque issues that the game has.I think that the paramount issue with Life is Feudal: YO is the simple fact that the advertisement for the game is misleading. Not on purpose mind, I simply feel as though the developers struggled to catagorize the game they have begun to produce and so consumers who stumble across it are not entirely sure what they are purchasing. I myself am very much into the Mount & Blade franchise and when I stumbled across this game I (and friends from my gaming community) expected it to be like a much larger open world RPG version of the mod for Mount & Blade: Warband, Persisitent World. The game showed pictures of an adventurer moving throughout a completely player made land. This gave me and my friends the misconception that the game was a Skyrim meets Mount & Blade meets Runescape/LOTR Online - what sounded like a perfect compliation.In actual fact the game is rust meets minecraft. It focuses on the survival aspect far more than the roleplaying rpg medieval aspect. This should be advertised FAR more clearly as survival game fans would appreciate it much more than Medieval role-play fans. Let me try to explain in a DayZ way, the server owners and their friends run around in full armour (like bandits/heroes) whilst everyone else hops from server to server with a few rags, they try to do something but every time they leave the server are forced to try again thanks to a lack of server favouriting implementation. This is fine, particularly in Alpha, but not what I thought when I was buying it.Good game for what it is in its current stage, but misleading in its advertisement and so that is forcing me to give it a negative review.Buy the game if you want a Rust esque survival, not a medieval RP RPG MMO sandbox game.

Early Access Review
								Remember:- life is feudal!Positives:- LiF:YO caters to a wide range of interests.  Ever wanted to be a town planner in medieval Europe?  Love farming simulation but kinda feel like a cheat sitting in a John Deere?  Fascinated by the history of feudal times and want to live it just a little?  Know the theories of Marx, Durkheim, and Weber and are interested in the sociological concepts of individualism and collectivism and want to try living in an age with a whole other mindset?  Or just love gearing up in metal stuff and hitting people with swords?  You will enjoy this game.Negatives:- This is where it gets hard.  Having played over 1000 hours before making this review.  just about all the things that I would have seen as a negative have improved or been fixed altogether.  The dev team has been brilliant, and if they keep delivering like they have, LiF:YO will go from being a great Alpha to a fantastic release.  Anyone who wrote a review not recommending the game essentially because it is Alpha should do the honest thing and try the game out again, then adjust their review if the problems they experienced have lessened or gone away.Gameplay:-  The most important thing to get right playing this game is to play it with other people.  Seriously.  If I had a thin leather for every player I've seen try to solo this game, and after a day or three depart forever leaving nothing but a tiny plaster shack, a furnace, and some unfinished wattle fencing, I'd have enough to armor 100 novice archers.  Remember, life is feudal.  In feudal times the average serf lived within spitting distance of at least a dozen other average serfs.  ""Ah!"" I hear you say; ""serfing isn't for me, I'll be a Lord or at least someone rich enough to own flanged mace!"".  Sure, in which case you'll need to be around even more people.  Coz heres the thing ok, Life is Feudal is about feudal life.  You ain't going to build any legends or awesome stories on your own.  Join a community, build a community, invite your friends, make new ones, whatever it takes, play this game with as many other people as you can.What could be improved:-  We're still waiting on a number of important features to be added, but LiF developers have been consistent in delivering updates and have issued a time frame for key updates to come.  In terms of adding to gameplay, all I'd suggest is added variation to life events.  Given there is no specific end game, interest in the game comes through experiencing different things.  Therefore the game is improved through increased variation of features and of random events.  Weather could have more influence on a range of gameplay aspects, illness (and alchemical medicines) could be introduced, random OP animals, NPCs in distress, custom weapons crafting, random disasters, and above all anything that enhances group-oriented and co-dependent play.  Why is there no specific end game?  Because this is about life... is... feudal, remember?			"

												I was reading some of the negative reviews for this game at first and after playing it wondered why it's received enough bad reviews to get the ""Mixed"" designation on steam. As you continue to play the game it becomes apparent though. Most of the ""survival"" genre fanbase is looking for something they can call ""realistic"" without having to put in the effort this game requires. Most gamers these days are all about instant gratification with minimal effort. Everything in the game takes time to build and to become proficient at. Couple that with a fanbase where 1/2 or more of the players come from games like DayZ or Minecraft, where important items are found at random on the ground and crafting is simple, and it shouldnt come to anyone's surprise that there would be enough bad reviews on steam to turn heads.All that being said, this game is a community effort that is made more enjoyable by either a small group of dedicated players or a larger one all pitching in for a specific goal. For me, its been a great experience with very few things to complain about. I have put a good chunk of time into it so far and plan to continue doing so. To be honest, it would be a disservice to the devs not to give them credit for what they have accomplished with this game, which is why i felt the need to write this in the first place. Hope this is helpful to some fans of the survival genre on the fence about buying the game! "

												To think that this game has ""Recent: Mixed, Overall: Mixed"" is madness. If I hadn't already bought and played this game (albeit for cheaper from a Humble Bundle), I probably would already have left the store page. Don't.This game is amazing. This game is so amazing. The crafting system is deep. The world in which you live is vast. Ok, so the combat system is hard, and is a little bit like mount & blade except you can't just swing your sword around and expect to kill everything -- you have to learn IRL how to do it, making sure that the correct part of your weapon hits the correct part of your oponent. But, this game is so fun, it's worth it.When you join a server, be careful, because if the GMs (that's the admins) are abusing their power, you may find a server that is two weeks old yet the GMs and their friends just happen to have stone castles. Yeah right. But there are some decent servers you can find by browsing the LiF forums, and if you want my advice, go for an RP PVP server.The RP is important in a game like this because it improves immersion. When someone rides up to you on a horse and hails you, and you're just a dirty little peasant with soil in your fingernails like a 9 year old boy who has been eating worms all morning, it's better to say HAIL MY LORD, I AM JUST PASSING THROUGH I MEAN NO HARM, than it is to go 'orite gr8 game isnt it'. When you turn up at the capital to trade and everyone is in RP, it's kind of like when you retired on World of Warcraft to an RP server so you could relax. It's all very cool.The crafting system is immense and I'm only at the wooden wall level, getting thin leather from hares. I don't even own sheep yet and a pig tried to gore me and I hadn't even drank any wine. There are lots of weapons. The armour is cool. But there is something even cooler, a really cool concept. You better still be reading this you peasant.Claims.So claims are these really cool things. A big sword sticking out of the ground, but it is how you create a guild. The best thing is that it gives you ownership of the land in a (to begin with) 10 tile radius. This goes up to 20 tiles, but you'll have to upgrade it if you want it to go further, up to 150 tiles (that's big (that's what she said)).This game has so much to offer. If it goes on sale, just buy it.One last thing, be prepared. It's one of ""them games"". One of the achievements is ""just 5 more minutes"" which is to play for 12 hours without disconnecting. Yeah hit that a few times. Another is ""my second life"" which is played for > 100 hours. I'll be there soon. Be prepared to be totally immersed, totally humbled, and totally awed.And if you need a server that is free from GM abuse or sophomoric peasant-hunting, message me.Now I gotta go cut trees down.			"

												We asked the admin on a server if he could help us out by spawning us some bones for our monument, since the server would crash if we killed an animal. (this has since been fixed)The admin spawned a bear right next to our camp, in which the bear decided we looked very tasty. The bear stampeeded across our nice neat rows of houses, attacking us and killing us mercicely. Eventually we chased the bear down the coast and beat it to death with shovels. After my team mates and I killed the bear, we proceded to all stand around and argue over who would get it.A fight ensued during which my character fell unconscious. My team mates then decided to either A) kill me with a shovel and save the effort or reviving me, or B) beat my broken bones back into place with a hammer.11/10 would listen to my team mates discuss how to torture my unconscious body again.ACTUAL REVIEW:GAMEPLAYOkay so this is a bloody fantastic game, you start out on an island with absolutly nothing. Combat is really fun and reminds me of Age of Chivary. There are so many options it is absolutly insane. They all work together flawlessly and end up making for a great gameplay, be it bloody combat or building yourself a settlement with friends. Key point about this game, YOU NEED FRIENDS OR YOU WILL DIE. It is very hard to solo this game. Almost impossible, I have not seen someone do it unless they steal/kill for their possesions. GRAPHICSD11 just got released two days ago, and already all of the graphical glitches I have seen have been fixed. This game runs very smoothly on ultra with my gtx 970. High settings I was running it at almsot 100 FPS. Even at high settings however the terrain looks absolutly beautifal.  "

								I don't know where to start! Life Is Feudal is by far one of the BEST sandboxes ive ever played. Its got unique systems and mechanics for crafting, forging, cooking, alchemy and other things like terraforming and logging. ALL of which have their own skill sets and levelling so you won't progess skills the same way twice, or find the same items & ingredients in the same place which is a nice touch. Depending on which server you are on, there are also variable stat & skill caps this means that if you specialise in a certain skill it can determine how useful you will be in building settlments, and once reach the leveling limit of one skill, thats it Reach the stat and skill caps and leveling up will be a distant memory as they will become rare occurences. This means prople of different skills will have to work together and pool resources and skills, especially if a battle takes place in nearby settlements/towns and repairs have to be made quickly. For example, one person of your group/guild might be a master blacksmith, while another will be a master Logger, so choosing which skill to level completely is CRUCIAL.You basically start the game with nothing but food scraps and rags for clothes, so your first instinct is to create primitive gear which can be done quite quicker than you would expect. As you start to meet random people in your travels, you will also start to learn of the surrondings more and where developments have been started. I remember one time where I spawned into the world and I basically turned right and saw an ENTIRE FORTRESS built far off into the distance on the other side of an island, and as I explored around there was the odd camp/shack then a small town where groups have formed a guild. It cleary shows the sheer scope of how important working with people is in this game.Another strong point is the combat mechanics, if you have played the Mount & Blade games you will feel right at home here with the directional movements and there are even group formations to be used in a battle! Formations like shield walls, phalanx/wedge, and defensive circle formations can be applied and changed on the fly in mid battle, VERY useful for when 2 armies or more are battling it out.The final thing you will notice (and the most notable when you start the game and spawn into a world) is the graphics. At the moment there are Direct x 7 and 9 graphics, DO NOT let the discussions and reviews fool you! This game is a visual master piece considering the DX7 and 9 graphics closely resemble TES4: Oblivion's graphics, but with the fast approaching release date the Direct x 11 graphics will make this one of the most beautiful medieval themed sandboxes ever made!Overall i give this game a 8.5/10 and thats just at an EARLY ACEESS point of veiw as Bitbox are at the moment of smoothing everything out for the release and beginning to implement future features upon post release. This has been one of the most comprehensive, immersive and challenging games ive played to date. Looking forwand to more! 11/10 would recommend this game to those who have never played sandboxes or similar themed games like MMORPG's as it is worth the experience.			"

								What happens if you take a healthy chunk of Rust, add sprinkles of Wurm Online, flavour it with bits of Mount & Blade and top it all off with a mixture of Ultima, Darkfall and EVE Online? Whether your answer is ""A flavourless, chunky paste"" or ""A gourmet masterpiece"", both have relevance when it comes to BitBox Ltd.'s first major project Life is Feudal (LiF). Yet still, while combining the well-known aspects of games like those mentioned above, the devlopers claim that LiF is absolutely unique and are working on some features to set it apart from its main competitors.In essence, LiF is a medieval themed sandbox online RPG, including all the survival and crafting mechanics the industry is so crazed about as of late. Familiarly, you are thrown into an immense world with nothing but some dirty clothes, provisions to last you a few days and your bare hands to help you survive. The now well honed instincts of a survival game expert should kick in immediately and drive you to forage for food, look for some basic resources to craft primitive tools with - you know the drill all too well. Where LiF differs is its skill system. Every character has a set of attributes and skills which will determine his ability to pretty much do anything, from a ""Nature Lore"" skill that will help you find more edibles on the ground to an array of crafting skills such as Carpentry, Masonry or Smelting. LiF is not intended to be played all by yourself and you will quickly find out why, as there is a skillcap in place, preventing you from being perfect at everything. Not long into the game you will have to decide which paths to go down and which ones to leave to other players. Eventually, your quaint community will should consist of a number of specialists working together. Building said community is one of the key features of LiF, as it offers every player total control over his environment. You can terraform the landscape, flatten out areas or dig up moats for your improvised stronghold, mine for minerals in underground tunnels (the world is voxel-based, much like Minecraft but with smooth edged) or build structures - watchtowers, shacks or entire castle towns, provided you have the resources for it and architects skilled enough to build something more complex than an axe made of a stick, plantfibre and flintstone. Another important skill-tree offers various combat skills, increasing your efficiency with certain weapons, armour or even horses and mounted combat (not yet implemented). This will help you fend off agressive animals or indeed other players, as LiF features full PvP and looting. While there are some penalties to going on a murder spree, it is an option and you will surely see more foe than friend. To help bring structure into this potentially chaotic environment, an upcoming feature will include land claims for individual players and for player-owned factions. These lands will be completely safe, but can be contested and captured in PvP faction vs faction wars. Three faction types are planned to exist: Bands/Orders, Fiefs and Kingdoms, the difference being size, influence over other factions and the amount of claimable land. This feature, however, will NOT be part of the game you see linked to this very review. LiF will effectively be released in two different versions: LiF: Your Own (reviewed, current build) and LiF: MMO. The latter will, according to the developers, feature a true massively multiplayer online persistent world with more than 10.000 players, a much bigger world and many features not available in LIF: Your Own, but is still well beyond our reach. LiF: Your Own meanwhile features dedicated serverplay with a maximum of 64 players playing on a 3x3km map.""Life is Feudal is a Unique Sandbox MMORPG."" is the claim made by the developers. Does LiF live up to it? While the current Early Access release build is actually still in early alpha, it is plain to see the effort behind the project, as well as the sheer amount of features available now and the even bigger number of things ""not yet implemented"", but already planned (horses, deeper combat, even more crafting). ""Life is Feudal"" is furthermore not just the title of this game, but one of its main directives. Survival is hard, especially when you're on your own. Learning skills takes time and dedication. Death is best avoided. If all of this sounds appealing to you, giving this game a chance would definitely be recommended. Be warned, though, because the current build (20/9/14) is pretty much as early as Early Access gets, so you will run into bugs, balancing issues and many buttons with the ""Not yet implemented""-stamp on them. Buying the game now means you are willing to help fund the further development of this title and be eligible to offer your own feedback.So tighten your straps, pull up those pontaloons and train your swordarm, things are about to get medieval up in here!

								I enjoy ARK, minecraft, KSP, and Neverwinter. (Just to give you an idea of my preferences.)This game *does* have some bugs remaining. I had some sort of memory leak (or other compouning problem) and sound issues after playing for awhile. It became unbearable after something like 5 or 6 hours (but my system is pretty high-quality, so your mileage may vary). However, a simple restart of the game solved the problem and only took a minute. This is not game-breaking.I love this game... but it won't be for everyone.Some things to note:A) Most servers use conservative server settings that are pretty close to default.B) At default settings, things in this game can take a long time and a lot of effort to achieve. You'll have to earn it.C) With default settings, you almost cannot survive alone. (Farming/nature lore can both allow you to forage for food, but cooking requires multiple skill sets that will almost undoubtedly require multiple participants. If you plan on jumping into the game with no friends to help you and with no idea what you're doing... you will probably fail.D) Some servers have much more newb-friendly settings... look for high level/stat caps and high resource gather multipliers/exp multipliers.E) Part of the appeal of this game *IS* the fact that it takes so much effort to be successful... reaching a milestone can be very rewarding. I'm looking forward to getting my first shack built.F) There's a lot to learn about this game, the wiki is your friend. G) Something that I had to find out through experience and lots of looking online: Many abilities require advanced skills with a skill level of 0... but they must still be unlocked to be used, and many require lots of skill levels in a prerequisite skill to be unlocked. IE: cutting billets for cooking fuel requires lvl 0 carpentry, but carpentry doesn't unlock until lvl 60 logging.H) Working with terrain is tedious and very time consuming... don't plan on getting in here and levelling mountains like in minecraft... you'll be digging the rest of your life... it's just implausible.I) The skill system is very detailed and random events can occur. I cut my hand while trying to forage and it bled for like 10 minutes. Not life threatening... but interesting. This game feels kindof like Neverwinter or D&D meets ARK set in medieval times.J) There's no magic (although prayer can have supernatural effects [including teleportation]).So far this is just a description of the main points of the game as I see it at the moment. Now for the good and bad.GOOD:-Devs are pretty active.-Plenty of servers with a variety of settings.-Very playable, few bugs.-Very unique.-Highly replayable. (partly because of how limited you usually are in character development)-Very conducive to roleplay. (Though it's often not required/expected)-The music. (I love it, totally my own opinion)BAD:-A little expensive for an alpha game.-Graphics are very mix-n-match. (IE: character model looks amazing, but the hair models look atrocious... kinda weird)-I love the focus on team-play... however, there *needs* to be a single skill set that will allow you to survive in the wilderness on your own. Sure, you won't be eating cake... and it's likely you'll spend most of your time hunting/fishing/gathering to support yourself... but it seems unrealistic that you can't have a single survival skill that enables you to build a simple campfire, hunt/fish, and grill up a bit of dinner. This could also make for a new skill tree leading into ""scouting"" skills. "

								It was a long time since I played ut I can definatley say it has come along way for the better. every community has people that dont like the game this one isnt impervius to t but i think those people are of a narrow mind in my opinion. the best things are the things you give a chance to come nto there own. I p[ayed if for a little bt in early alpha phase and decided that there were nough people involved that my opiniion wouldnt matter too much, as I dont have a ton of time t game ut all the time consistantly like some people. I think this version of Life is feudal is worth a buy just as much as the upcoming MMO. the reason why I like the Life is Feudal your own, is because most of the servers are Community run by players and its a very cool Experience. If you ike medievil Roleplay and really dont ike games that are too easy then get LIF YO its a good buy with hundereds of hours of gameplay and if you stream or love roleplay in general this game s for you, you can do so much you can be anything you like. you can be the sole provider of materials that everyone needs for there buildings the opprotuines are endless in my opinion and the first chance I get ill be streaming it again. Hoping to get a f3w copies for giveaways so anyone reading ths review is more then welcome to come take a look at my twtch channel and give a follow to be eligable for any giveaway you must follow :). my twitch is www.twitch.tv/IconiKRon hope i can find a really god server for when the big update happens cant wait to stream it :)			"

												(eng) (рус)This is basically your collective farm simulator, an online 'Crazy Farmer' time management game enriched with something like 'Mount&Blade'/'War of The Roses' fighting system. It's got nice interface, comprehensive tutorial and decent engine, and as an old 'M&B' fan I felt myself almost at home here right away.. until I tried game hunting. Man, all the animations are so clunky it's painful to see in 2016! I've been playing 'M&B' since almost 10 years ago (alfa) and now I don't see any substantial progress in that respect. Stupid horses and then that elk.. I feel pity for them. Ok, I'll take a deep breath and tell you how it was.The tutorial said I should select a patch of soil and choose 'search for peaceful animal tracks'. There was nothing. Being a city dweller I still surmised to look at a nearby lake's shore. I found tracks of cloven hoof, they appeared at the ground as highlighted texture spots leading to the forest. I followed that curved line and it seemed funny how it passed right through some large trees, that's where I started to feel suspitious about the software. After a while I spotted a couple of horses.. which should be odd-toed. Eh, who needs that foolish botany anyway? I closed on them, they just lied down before me. I thought it will be an easy task, maybe a part of tutorial. My axe hit the nearest one in the head for no visible effect, it jumped up and ran away, but not far. I started chasing it to the lake, then to the mountain, it went through trees not noticing them and ploughed into uneven ground. On our way we also spooked an elk and some geese. I switched to chasing the elk. I managed to make a slingshot while it waited for me nearby. The animals also lacked animations, as well as the brains, they seemed to follow just one algorythm - kept some distance. After I had hit the mammal for the 20th time with a stone it turned on me and horned me till I fell unconscious.. without any animation.The game is not finished, it's totally unpolished, crude as a stone axe, and it's technological basis already feels outdated! All in all, if you are very patient I strongly advise you to go build yourself a real house in the woods instead of playing this. For others there are much more cheerful middle-age lifestyle simulators on the market.-------------------------------------------------------------------------В основе своей это ваш симулятор колхоза, многопользовательская ""Бешеная ферма"" про управление временем, обогащенная чем-то типа боевой системы ""Седла и клинка""/""Войны роз"". Тут приятный интерфейс, понятное обучение и неплохой движок, и как старый фанат ""СиК"" я почувствовал себя сразу почти как дома... пока не попробовал охотиться на дичь. Боже, анимация так груба, что больно смотреть в 2016 году! Я начинал играть в ""СиК"" почти 10 лет назад (с альфы), и вот я не вижу серьезного прогресса в этом отношении. Глупые лошади, и потом этот лось... мне жалко их. Ладно, давайте я сделаю вдох и расскажу по порядку.В обучении сказали выделить клочок земли и выбрать ""поиск следов мирного животного"". Ничего не было. Будучи гордским жителем, я все же сообразил поискать на берегу ближайшего озера. Нашел следы раздвоенных копыт, они появились на земле в виде подсвеченных текстурных пятен и вели в лес. Последовав по этой извилистой линии, я порадовался тому, как она проходила прямо сквозь большие деревья, тут я начал что-то подозревать об этой программе. Потом я заметил впереди пару лошадей... которые по идее непарнокопытные. Э, да кому нужна эта дурацкая ботаника? Я приблизился к ним, они просто улеглись передо мной. Я подумал, что это будет легко, как этап обучения.Топор ударил ближайшую в голову без видимых последствий, она вскочила и убежала, но не далеко. Я за ней к озеру, потом на гору, она неслась сквозь деревья и тонула в неровностях почвы. По дороге вспугнули лося и гусей. Я переключился на лося. Умудрился смастерить пращу, пока он меня ждал неподалеку. Животным не хватало анимаций, равно как и мозга, похоже, у них был единственный алгоритм - держать некоторое расстояние. Когда я попал в эту тушу камнем в двадцатый раз, он развернулся и бросился меня бодать без всякой анимации, я упал в обиорок.Игра не закончена, совершенно не доведена до ума, груба как каменный топор, а ее техническая база уже смотрится устаревшей! В общем, если вы очень терпеливы, настоятельно вам советую построить себе настоящий домик в лесу вместо этой игры. Для прочих на рынке представлены гораздо более веселые симуляторы средневековой житухи.			"

												Well playing this game around 6 to 8 months ago for around 40 hours, i loved the game. The problems I see right now are: 1. The biggest and most annoying one is GUI glitches. It makes your character wig out,trees look like there circling your screen along with grass, and your game crashes for no reason because of optimization issues. 2. You can't seem to stay in a server more than 10 minutes with out crashing for some reason.It just won't keep you connected. 3. Developers released it before it was ready. The really need to fix the graphics and stability beforethey should consider this a released game. They really need to get a beta test going for stability patches. Out side of those 3 major issues I've encountered, the game is great. However they really need to step up thereoptimization before getting there mmo out. I would hate to see that mmo version littered with the current bugs on the private servers ruin it before it even got a chance to get off the ground. As of right now, I can't reccomend this game. As I've seen others state, im kind of annoyed at the way there putting this game on sale. It is a disrespectful way to advertise because the testers have actually put in time and money into this game.			"

												I've been following and playing this game for quite some time now and it has certainly come a long way fromwhen I first saw it.With Alpha and Beta testing for the MMO server happening, this games final iteration is quickly closing in but I'm more than certain it's not the last.It's the first survival crafting game I've seen that takes the right approach to encourage cooperation. Just throwing zombies everywhere and a food and drink meter isn't enough, Rust or Dayz is a prime example of that.Sure it is technically feasible to build everything on your own, at a very basic level. The skill system makes it so that you can only become proficient enough in only a small handful of professions, trying to master all is impossible and will make you lose skill in others. This makes it so that everyone who plays can pick their role and that role will be valueable and needed. You then go find others with different skills, you work together, build together, fight together, survive. Eventually you get yourself a nice little village going and attract more people, it just goes on from there.Arbitrary rating 7/10This version is technically for private servers, the devs true vision is seeing this at an MMORPG scale.

								Excellent game, it has a lot of unique features, it is extremely hard to get anything done in game without having a friend or 2 since you cant learn all the skills on the tech tree on one character. The game is somewhat unoptimized and using a older game engine and because of this does not look really all that amazing. But visuals dont count as much as the amount of fun that you have while playing the game. I would recommend this title to anyone who likes a time consuming and indepth medieval life simulator. If they had used unity as the game engine then this game would have been totally ruined so i will settle with the subpar visuals it has for the better netcode.			"

This game is a huge time pit, the crafting is amazing, and in depth. It also requires many many hours of it.

												A sad conclusion to a glorious dream that most likely will never come to pass. So many ideas and potential yet very few realised. I was bewitched by this game and for a moment wished and hoped and bought in. The cake was however a lie, I should have known better.The launch of Forest Village probably signifies what we all secretly knew but didn't want to admit, abandonment. Maybe I am wrong and I really hope I am but right now I see no point recommending this game. It doesn't need more money thrown at it, it needs a LOT of work. I mean the only significant news/updates since May have been the ""MMO version beta testing starting"" and the announcement of a spinoff title, Forest Village. I don't even know how to feel about this game and its devs anymore. Make your own judgements but my advice would be to hold off.P.S. Is this game out of Early Access....? If so, how on earth were they allowed to launch the game in this state...? Fml... I'm done.			"

												If you want an in depth experience with an incredibly deep crafting system, this game is for you. If you are looking for a quick fix, easy to play, low commitment game, then you are probably looking in the wrong place.Not sure why there are negative reviews popping up for this game during release. Are there issues? From what I have seen online, sure. Are the developers working to fix these issues, absolutely, just go take a peek at the news feed. I must be one of the extremely lucky ones that is only having a few minor texture issues, and the developer is aware of that and is working on that as well.This game is one of the best looking, most in depth games I have come across in a long while, and I'm extremely happy I stumbled upon it. If you are concerned about the issues they are having at launch, just keep an eye on the news feed and they will let you know when they have come upon a fix for them. Other than that, this developer is actually listening to the community and working on player suggestions to add to an already pretty amazing game. The reality is, this was an early access game that made it to release, and that in itself is a rare and amazing thing, Bitbox should be commended for the time and effort they have and continue to put into a game that they are clearly as passionate about as a lot of the people who play it are.

There are a lot of bugs, but once they handled, this game will be unstoppable.  You have to put a lot of time into it and it has a 90 degree learning curve, which is rough at first, but after a few days, you will get a grip on it and things take off.  You'll have a blast.			"

								This game is not for the impatient, however I never knew things so monotonous, like shoveling dirt, or chopping down trees could be so darn entertaining.  I often ask myself, ""Am I having fun....?  I honestly can't tell....""  But in the end, even if you just accomplished your first tiny shack made out of clay and dirt, the reward is far greater than any other game I've played so far.  The game is a lot of fun with your friends, but is also very do-able if you wanna try it solo as opposed to what a lot of other people say.  Just be sure to pick a server with no skill cap and a decent community.			"

												The best Survival RPG I've played in years. If you can fight past some minor bugs (which the admin is always happy to help you get past) then this game is an easy 9/10 in my book. Down to the awesome community, to the very in depth crafting system with items having a quality. This game can be a bit ""Grindy"" in a sense nothing comes quickly, but this is a good thing. It keep the toxic younger community away. Death is something that isn't taken lightly, punishing criminals (PKers) with much higher skill loses, in a game where skill can be very hard to earn. Learning this game on your own is challenging, since there is almost no in game tutorials, so look for someone to settle with if your new and maybe they'll show you the ropes if you approach kindly.

								First off, I am really enjoying this game and from the different posts, reddit's and everything else this game seems to have some awesome features still to come.I have read through many posts and from what i can tell, the people who say this game sucks should go back to playing MMO # 327 or whatever generic title suits you.  This game is a survival/crafting/building/pvp/pve game.  I have to laugh when i heard someone say this game sucks because it is grindy, then they go into a ""better"" MMO and jump into an area with high mob repawn to ""power level"".  You guys crack me up.  Yes, you need to build, gather, transport goods to your base, plow land, seed, etc. etc., but what MMO exsists to this day that doesnt need some type of investment of time or energy.  Just like any game, you get out what you put into it.Anyway, to my point, this game is exploring down an uncharted path with some very new and unique ideas and even more improvments and twists on old ones.For those that dont take the time to read, this game will be off dedicated/restricted servers and the ultimate plan is for it to be an MMO.  It is not a full MMO right now, so dont expect it to be, I think of LIF YO as an early Alpha for the MMO.Buy it, you know you want too, time to let go of the standard MMO model.			"

								( wrote this before release )Lemme' tell you this.I am currently in actual testing of this product.This is LiF: YO, not the actual MMO yet. This is a very much scaled down version for continued development. You will have the ability to do many of the things coming to the MMO, some much sooner than later, some not for a bit of time yet. No, I am not at liberty to share much info, being a humble test guy, I will say this.. this is going to be the 'must have' of Medieval style games. No magic, no orcs, no elves, just a pretty much true to life feudal world, where you can be literally anything by striving for it. The game has open PvP but with a price. If you feel the need to be a bandit then thats fine, but every action will mark you, killing an innocent will cost you until your a marked criminal with no coming back, and if you die, you lose massive skills, whereas being a highwayman and just robbing people will only mark you as a thug. Meanwhile fighting and being a hero in the warfare will gain you status, along with helping out folks. So its pretty much set like real life, you can be / do what you want, but actions have consequences. It also requires you realize your not alone in the world. You cant do it all. Everyone serves a role, from the butcher, the baker to the candlestick maker, even the village monk / priest, or gaurd. IE I am not a fighter myself, so I really rely on the combat guys, but they rely on others to cook for them. etc. This is shaping up to be great!			"

												Life is feudal is a grinding game, everything takes a significant investment of time and patience so this is not a casual game.  If you're looking for something to do for half an hour before the wife and kids get in and ruin your afternoon then stick to CoD.  If you have no wife or kids or job and just sit around playing pc games maybe smoking some pot (living the dream)  then get this!  One of the nicest looking survival sims it provides an almost unparalleled satisfaction when you finally get your tiny shack,  kiln or Manor house complete.  It also has an active player base and plenty of servers so you should find one near you with ease			"

								So, i've been playing Life is Feudal for about 100 hours on a dedicated server. i want to start by saying how surprised i am to read so many bad reviews. This is the most extensive detailed and feature full survival game i have ever played. I have played all of them. that said i hope to see the community grow and for people to give the game a chance. there were a few points where i just wanted to give up because every takes so long and when you think your getting somewhere you realize you have so much work to do yet. but it's rewarding as hell. i can hop on to a rust server and have everything in the game in about 1 hour. lol. this is laughable compaired to LIF. if you like instant gratification this game is not for you. if you like a world that is truley crafted by you and the other players and want to work for what you get in the game, it's for you...

								This game takes a lot of patience. Don't buy it if you aren't prepared to put time and effort into learning the complex crafting and combat system. The wiki does a fairly good job of helping you to understand the game more. All in all, I have spent 1000 hours of my life playing this game. I love the free build system, love the Guild Claims and thankful I can actaually play a female character now instead of only being able to play Baldy. This game can be confusing as hell when you first start, and it takes a little while to get used to the grind. Definitely a game to play with a guild rather than alone if you want to get anywhere with it. Love the communities that grow on the servers. Would recommend this game to anyone that doesn't mind a couple of annoying bugs and wants to have fun working things out and muck around with mates.			"

The combat can be a little frustraiting at first, but we are not here to keeeeel each other yet. I wish there was more freedom with crafting. So far everything I have made been prebuilt. Plaster house  you put down in location and fill with materials to construct it. Also good luck getting the land flat when you do plat your house. It's just annoying to level the ground to build.

								I think the game has a lot of potential but I put quite a few hours in and didn't get very far. My biggest complaint is the lack of players and npcs make the game seem very empty. I spent most of the time I played it in solitude. I think the game can be really great if they can deal with the feel of isolation. NPC villages and wild animals I think would be a great improvement. I liked the crafting system and the realism but there needs to be more interaction with things other than the enviroment. I'd be willing to try it again once its released.			"

												AMAZING GAME... IF YOU PUT THE EFFORT IN 8/10 if you want to load in and be wreckin da noobz in 10 minutes then you will not like this game.  It is a alpha many things that have frustrated me have changed for the better and yeah some are still frustrating but they are on the list to be fixed.  Again if you expect instant gratification you will NOT like this game.  If you have a old POS computer you will NOT like this game.  If you run on a server that cant handle it you will not like this game.  But if you can look beyond a few glitches and see the potential for what it can be and hopefully WILL be this game is amazing.Update..   After 2600 amazing hours in this game I still love it and look forward to the MMO.  I have bought 4 copies for friends and family and do not regret a dime spent.  99% of the glitches and issues that the game had at the start have been fixed.  Some will not be fixed until the MMO comes out.   If anyone is struggling in the game I would glady help you out just friend req me and drop me a message.Update..  After 4099 hrs i still love the game.  I am burned out awaiting the release of the MMO but i feel that it is still one of the best games i have ever played.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is very interesting. While yes it is one of those ""survival sandbox"" games which has (until 4 days after this review) been in early access, it is also one of the most original and expansive of those on offer.The game itself has managed a wonderful feeling of immersion in its own world/lore. When you play it you can be quite content with the feeling of actually being in the world your character is surrounded by. I will now break this review down into a few sections:Gameplay:This game takes a long time. That is a key point, do not expect to have a massive medieval castle and town within 5 hours of playing the game. Large parts involve effectively grinding (!FLUX! - players will know) to find the resources you need to construct/create the buildings/items you want. However teamwork is amazingly useful because it reduces the time needed to perform many actions. Such that imagine 1 person takes 1 hour to perform an action, 2 people would then take less than half an hour to do the same action.Also as this is a survival game you need to gather food to survive. This is relatively simple if you have found a few reliably good quality apple trees. You will also need to 'rest' your character occasionally if performing tough work such as terraforming or construction etc.This leads me onto another important point regarding skill progression. The game is designed, as I've said previously and as you will hear through this review, for teamplay. A limitation imposed by this is such that you cannot be an expert at everything! You have a limited number of skill points to distribute around the various skills (which unlock in a skill-tree type fashion). As you perform actions these skill points will be added to your skill in that action up to your limit (you can 're-spec' by downgrading your skills if needed). Because of this you will need a group to play with unless you set your game/server to have custom (default is 800 I think) levels of skill points.Graphics:This game has looked absolutely fine throughout its development but its looming DX11 release looks incredible from what we've seen thus far. Other than this I cannot comment much on this point other than it runs very well without many framerate dips etc. so seems quite optimised.Music/Audio:The sound quality is great with well recorded clips for all actions and a nice atmospheric background soundtrack, although if playing for many hours at a time it can get a little repetitive.I'm not used to writing reviews (this is my first so I know I will have missed a lot) so please don't hate :P			"

												I've played plenty of survival games in my time, and this is hands down my favorite. The overall feel of a server's community entirely revolves around human nature. Some people want to be barbarians, some want to be bandits, a lot more just want to coexist. In the end, your experiences depend on which you choose.Barbarians (people who run around naked screaming obscenities ad decapitating deer) tend to add a bit of comedic relief to the trying environment that is LiF, but may also come and burn your house down and steal your chickens.Bandits come in two flavors. They either roleplay and hold you up much like a common highwayman, or run around in packs of 4+ and just kill some poor naked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ under the illusion that they have gear worth taking.Coexisting countrymen constantly care for each other like cousins. The core concept is to cooperate in a calculated campaign of carpentry, construction, calipers, and cooking. This competing collection of corroborative characters can, and commonly do, cause caustious- ok enough with the alliteration.tl;dr If you aren't a bard or bandit you typicaly form a group and make friends through helping each other build a small settlement. If you are like me, you tend to do this with around 15 other people, the majority of which are on Teamspeak. The few times you get attacked either end in everyone dying or some lone wannabe bandit getting chased off by a dozen angry, heavily-armed and armoured peasants weilding the fruits of their labor as weapons of death.To be fair, i have had my troubles wanting to play this game but this is for personal reasons. I can not handle stress due to a medical condition I have. This being said, you will stress a lot in this game. (Is that naked man on a horse really a bandit with his armour deequipped to lull us into a false sense of security, or is he some scrub fresh spawn that got lucky and found a horse already?) These are the questions that can get people killed, or get people killed. It is very rare for most people to trust one another on a server with known bandits and barbarians as they recruit more as the server grows. In the end though, this game is a delight to have in my steam library and I'm happy to have spent $40 on it.Please read the comments to get a more updated look at my experience with the game as it develops.

								One word.  AWESOME.  This game is being designed to be effectively limitless in possibilities, realistic ones at that, and the current limits, considering it is still early access, are constantly being expanded.  Great appearance helps as well.  PvP is fun.The one note that I will make is that this game is not for the weak of heart.  To be successful takes a LOT of time and effort as well as a group of friends.  It is incredibly difficult to setup a successful community with a cooperative group of 10 people, and even more difficult to do on your own, though it can be done.  This isn't the result of a game flaw, this is how the game is intended to be.  Forest disappears very quickly once you start constructing even small buildings, as the materials gained from harvesting things like trees is pretty realistic.  Unlike other games, new trees don't just sprout up in their place, you need to plant more.  Planting is easy, but even with ideal weather conditions it takes real life days (up to a week I think) for the trees to mature into a useful, harvestable material.  This is just one example.  This game is difficult, and it is meant to be.  One HUGE advantage from this is that there are far fewer♥♥♥♥♥hats that just run around abusing people for the sake of doing so, and most of the time if someone does that they are banned.  The rationale is that if you want your character to be a bandit and steal from others, that is fine.  But if you're just going to grief people, that drives players off, resulting in smaller/fewer groups building on a server which ends up in server death.  The requirement of cooperation really encourages players to respect one another.  Players are also less likely to risk losing things, such as weapons, attacking other people unless there is a good reason, as replacing them takes a significant amount of time, work, and help from other people.If you truly enjoy survival this game is for you.  You can always setup a local game and adjust the difficulty to be easy to do on your own, but most servers do NOT do that.Definitely a great game with a great future.			"

I am looking forward playing this game in the next year, as they add more content and fix the more major bugs. The game still shows sings of alpha.I would not reccomend buying the game at it's current state, unless you can get over the occational crashing and lag, and enjoy grindy hard-starting skilltrees. It's still worth putting on your wishlist and watch list, to see where it goes in a year.			"

								I bought and played for a 2 hour test and found it very in depth and the community very friendly. It requires a lot of time however, and can be very grindy. You start off with a small amount of food and some rag clothing. From there it is up to you to start developing your character how you want. You can prospect the ground for ore, get the bark off a tree, collect sticks, search for edible food on the ground, etcHowever, actions take quite a bit o f time and do not always increase your skill.Here's one example. When you search the ground for food the action takes some time and often turns out no results. Tha's because action success is based on random chance.  If your action is not succesful you don’t gain skill. If the actions is successful you do gain skill, but you don’t improve your chances of being successful in the future.I posted on the fourm that I wonder why games like this are so mundane when they could easily take place in a much more imaginitive world, and within 5 min the Dev banned me with no warning.Here's the post that got me banned: https://sites.google.com/site/thebannedpost/NOTE: This review got me perma-banned. The Devs tried to censor this review, but I guess Steam wouldn't let them, since my only ""threat"" was that I would be writing a negative review.The personal attacks in their response below are simply unprofessional, and show an immature attitude towards players with whom they have a disagreement.

												Life is Feudal is by far one of the most grindy games I've ever played, but its also one of the BEST games I've ever played. And heres why: So Im running along a beach one day and I see a Norsemen hacking away at the ground... Making a mine. I ask if I can help and he says ""Sure"". About an hour and a half later we have successfully tunneled well into the ground, finally uncovering the prize: Iron ore. As we are rejoiceing about advancing into the iron age. We turn around and see that our tunnel has collapsed and we cant get out... So we try the pray abilty and it does not work, we try despretrly to mine our way out but we cant, there was no place to but the stuff we were mining out therefore there was no way to get out. We even try to call an admin to get us out but had no luck. About an hour later I decide that I will kill him and he will come back and mine me out. So I hack him to death and he respawns, but apprantly he spawned on the very south tip of the map... Seems legit. Even though we were in the north. So another 30 mins goes by and finally he arrives and then I think to myself ""It would be pretty funny if I tryed prayed again and it spawned me home"" BOOM I hit 7 and I spawned at my house.             10/10 would get stuck in tunnel with a harry Norsemen again.

								this is a slow pased game, and it does what it does the best.no other game does this level of grueling realism as L.I.F does.you will invest weeks into this game, so winning feels ♥♥♥♥ing amazing and loosing might make you commit sudoku.the ""end game"" is literally comprised of politics, real world functioning politics that come into fruition naturally.built a castle from the ground up that took you 5 months and were there from the beginning? well prepare yourself for quick tounged burocrates to rob you of whats yours!the only reason this game has a mixed review rating is because 12vies bought this game expecting a ""real world mine craft clone"" and instead got hit in the face with a game that very closely mimics reality well, and thus they all threw in the towel.this game is great. most probably the best comunity surrounding a game.you like role playing? does not matter, because this game MAKES you role play to survive.

								It's not often I say this but this is truly one of the best games I've ever played.The strategic elements and forward planning, the detailed construction, the shear amount of content, the teraforming, the skill system/tree, everything...Heck, this IS literally the best $40 I've ever spent. Only had the game for 2 days now and have been forcing myself to take breaks else I get lost in it.Please people, anyone looking at buying this game, it is not for the rushed and the easily bored...This game requires patience, determination, and a LOT of planning. I plan to make this my most played game ever.Most gripping, most rewarding, most enjoyable.So have fun, and remember, Life Is Feudal! [10/10]			"

												Devs done a great job with updating the graphics to directX11, if feels like a different game now.The game works just fine on high or ultra settings with 30-60 fps (v-sync on) if you have a decent card. There are some minor bugs that I'm sure they will get fixed ,like paved roads showing black, but in the end it is a great game and It's worth playing if you are not a casual gamer.PS: I you have an nvidia card I recommend you user driver version 353.62. As a fact I used the latest nvidia driver and the graphics were all glitchy and got low fps.			"

								Developer's financing shenanigans aside, LiF:YO isn't all that bad by itself.The game world is somewhat nice and immersive and there is a rather large range of occupations to be had.In-game progression is however really REALLY slow (though I find it make achieving one's goal all the more rewarding).While social interactions are mandatory to advance, (unless you have multiple accounts) I found I could get fairly high in the progression tree by myself.Where the game ultimately fail for me is in the painfully slow rate of development progress or I should say lack off combined with the high price they ask for it.Combat system which would give an incentive to attack/defend resources is mostly broken, decay system has not really been addressed properly, UI is terrible, there is no natural way (short of an admin intervention) to fill trenches and holes dug by players and as of yet, no officials servers. Which mean all that unless the server is yours, there's no guarantee your hard work will still be there tomorrow or the day after.With hindsight, I feel my time and money would have been better spent somewhere else.

												Age of Empires - in the first person! --Reviewed at 18 hours--If you are in doubt about this game, I urge you to just jump in and YouTube & Wiki willing you will enjoy this game!There is little to no tutorial and things may frustrate you, I would urge you to push past this and open up a world of possibilitiesNot many games get 15 hours of straight play; Life is Feudal did it for me.The game based in a medieval era urges the players not to play as a simulator but to think logically and forward think for your new character and live in the world grinding out skills to reach the next skill type that you need to progress your settlement. (So yes it is a simulator but not to the level that we have previously known it, you get invested in your players as you roleplay out their lives and complete many, many tasks)As a SP game it will be hard to manage your land and its needs along with other players in the MP realm... You may choose to be a travelling tradesmen specialised in your skill trading for what you need or you might choose to join a group and move forward in leaps and bounds for the greater good of the group... However be forewarned, as you grow into a large group the needs change and your supply of food and mining rewards may begin to find a low and risk everything that you have so far worked so valiantly for!The depth of this game is astounding, the devs listen to the gitch reports and actively seek to fix them with frequent patches. Yes glitches do occur and there are other things that just don't match up; this game has come a long way from its alpha release in many ways and its current gameplay today proves just that.The question is are you willing to fork out your own investment into a character and help etich them them into history.10/10 for such vast gaming ideas8(9) for current game state due to some stability issues8.5 for graphics - this game is beautiful, however Nvidia uses may struggle; the Devs use ATI.8 for sound - mesmerizing10 for the right server and community inputBuy the game if you are on the fence;buy the game if you doubt the glitches;buy the game if you like medieval games;buy the game if you like want minecraft with REAL graphics;buy the game if you like Age of Empires, it's it in first person!

								After spending quite a few hours straight since I bought it, I think this game is a great game. However, there are flaws that I must state in the current version of the game.Pro's:The game is very community friendly. You don't have to worry about getting non-stop attacked or killed. Most servers don't allow random and no reason killing. Where as in games like DayZ, or Rust you have people who just constantly kill for no reason.This game is very relaxing. Those nights you get off from work and don't feel like just running around and gunning people down in FPS games. This game is great as to where you can just sit, listen to the very relaxing and beautiful music, and build while maybe watching a movie or something.Can do and build what you want, and how you want. If you want to take a week or so to build a huge underground fort, you can. If you want to build a stronghold, you can. Or perhaps a beach farm, you can. You can pretty much do what ever you want in this game, if you have the time and patience.Great and beautiful graphics. They are just stunning and beautiful to sit and stare at. Very fleshed out as well.-----------------------------------Cons:Optimization is not great. If you run it on medium or low, you can roughly get around 20-30 FPS with a mid tier PC. If you want to run anything above that, you'll need to have the most modern and updated gaming computer. Even then, there's no telling if you'll get anything above 30fps.Worlds are just dead, and rely too much on player to player interaction. The servers are not dead, just the world feels really empty. There's hardly any wildlife, and the map is so big, you'll rarely come across other players, even on 64 player servers filled. The building feature even revolves way too much on player interaction, because how many items you need to build certain things, and how long they take to aquire them.Obtaining weapons take a very long time. You can almost immediatly get tools, and a sling with rocks, however if you want to use a bow, crossbow or sword it, takes a whole town to wield them, because first you have to build a smithy, which requires all these other objects that require skills, and the skill like contruction take a very long time to level up if you're by yourself.The requirement for a friend/s to play with you. If you want to get anywhere without taking a few weeks to build a small town, you need atleast a friend or two. The length it takes to collect items from things like tree's, rocks, ores, and even food is so long, and most items you get is only 1 every 15-20 seconds, which is not a lot seeming as how you need around 10 things you may or may not get from searching for a simple fence.Some skills like fishing is very obsolete because of how they were implemented. I spent over 45 minutes trying to catch one fish, because somehow in 1,000BC fish are so rare. Then when you get a fish and cook it, your campfire somehow gets broken, and the fish only gives you about 20 hunger regen, when something like an apple which is pretty common and you collect around 23 in 5 seconds gives like 17-20 hunger regen.Hunting is also pretty obsolete because of how hard/long it takes to get a bow and how little wildlife there is.------------------------------------------------Anyhow my total ranking is, 7.5/10. There's a lot of potential here, and I hope we get more patches before the september release.			"

								This is one hell of a game, with a ton of potienal! The crafting system is deep, the land scape is beautiful. The story? There is none, you make your own story with your friends. This game is ment to be played with friends, up to 64 of them! Making a small civilization with farms, mining and hunting are a few things you achieve in this game. Its definately a game to keep an eye open for, Myself and my friend made a basic beginners guide for new players to the game! Be sure to check it out!

												as much time as I put into this game, I thought I'd be writing a positive review but that is not the case. I had my own monument and land, I had some of the basic buildings like a stable, a barn and a couple houses. It was fun when i started but as I played I saw others come and go constantly, not many came back to play after one or two times of playing, so unless your IRL friends are going to play with you, assume you'll do a lot of building alone or join up an already built kingdom. Also, horses are a problem. Don't run through trees because you will be slowed down and the game is likely to crash. This happened to me multiple times and I saw it happen to people on my land as well, almost every time I played. If you are on a horse and crash on someone else's land, and don't get back on within a couple minutes consider the horse theirs now unless you are someone like myself who would in fact return the horse to the rightful owner. In addition to those issues, I constantly had problems with my drying racks glitching, unable to dry animal skins so they would just be sitting there useless until the server refreshed. speaking of servers refreshing this means your herb gardens are going to too, so you have to time it just right to get your herbs that take 6 hours to produce. I tried 3 times and every time I didn't get my herbs to make flux so I said forget that and just started trading other kingdoms for flux. Its a fairly decent game but I just couldn't recommend it, maybe the MMO will be better but the game as is, no. just no.			"

												Probably the most potential for any early release title I've ever owned.  I picked this up as part of a humble bundle after having it on my wishlist for a year or so, and I regret not buying it outright sooner.  Progression is slow and painstaking, but in a way that is highly rewarding and meaningful.  MMO beta is just about under way now, which I am anticipating more than BF1 or Civ6 for 2016 releases.There are a fair share of growing pains in the 'your own' hosted server community, and some less than admirable server admins out there, but none the less this is an awesome game that you should play if you have any interest in RPGs or survival games.  Highly recommend			"

												This game is fantastic! Its a very well made game for its current state and is very fun to play with friends. The game may seem grindy if playing alone and if the server you play on doesnt have ore piles (which means you have to haul rock) but if you join a large group of people or have a large group of friends playing you can easily build a castle in a day. The adventure, hunting, building and combat in this game in phenomenal, and very well done too, the only REAL complaint I have about building is that Flux takes forever to get. The graphics in the game are GREAT, especially since they just updated them and the music in the game is also very immersive and great to listen to. Overall I give it a 9/10    - When the full MMO comes out (or if they put in dragons) this game is an easy 10/10 and would be my pick for Game of the Year			"

												I bought LiF:YO during EA and it was such a bore. I uninstalled and walked away within two hours. However, I decided to give it another try after it hit full release, and I've got to admit I was pleasantly surprised!LiF:YO has come a long, long way from it's EA days. It is still a grind, but not in the ""oh I have to grab 200 stones to make this"" but in the ""holy crap, this is a hardcore survival game!"". You are not handed items, you are not handed stats, you have to earn everything you want. You want to craft an iron sword? Start prospecting, mining, and smelting. You want to plant an apple tree? Start gathering plants, sowing seeds, and tilling the land. This is a game you spend many hours on just to get started. While this may sound like a negative, it gives you a sense of accomplishment that many survival games have long forgotten.			"

												Alright, first things first, I returned the game. I know what youre think, ""Why are you giving it a thumbs up then?"" Because, its a good game, its just not my game. This game is a very time consuming game, more so than Civilization III. I can handle playing Reign of Kings or Rust, but this game is too complicated and too slow for my taste. Lets go over how its somewhat of a decent game, It reminds me of DnD (Dungeons and Dragons). The actions that your perform on a tree alone, show how indepth the game really gets. You can rip the bark off, see if its a fruit bearing tree, break a branch off, or chop it down. Its really a work of beauty to see that kind of detail in a game like this. All in all, i think if i had a better computer for this, i would totally play more but after two hours, i gave up. Maybe one you guys will enjoy it.This is a post release review, just so you know. Never played early access.			"

								Let me start by saying that for more than 10 years, I've been waiting for a sandbox that would rival Ultima Online. Nothing could ever quite match up. I seriously think this might be the one. And that's a big statement for me. *fans self* I'm getting a little emotional here.What struck me about this game is that it is a challenge. I appreciate that in order to get somewhere in this game - to accomplish anything - you must really pay attention. You won't find random epic loot in chests. You won't get neat armor from killing a bear. Bears don't wear armor. It just makes sense. I also really love that you can spend your time doing whatever it is that floats your boat. You don't HAVE to do anything to have a fulfilling game. It's a true sandbox. Right now, I'm playing on a fairly small server. There are usually 3 - 5 people playing at a time. But already, there is community. I can imagine that it will only improve once there are more players coming in. Because there are SO many skills, and so many jobs to do, trading and building alliances actually has meaning. Obviously because it is in alpha, there are some bugs and improvements to be made. I'm confident that they'll be coming in time. There are some things that seem overly difficult, although it may vary from server to server. For example, on my particular server, apples never grow back. We must plant and replant. Food is quite difficult to come by. Foraging for edible plants almost never finds anything.  A disproportionate amount of time is spent trying to find it, and hunger levels grow quite rapidly. I spend alot of time catching my breath, and waiting to be able to play again. After all that mining and lumberjacking, I would have thought my character would be fit enough to run for 20 seconds! :POverall though, I really highly recommend this game. After just a few hours, I was hooked. There is a steep learning curve, but there are many resources online that will answer your questions.I'm very optimistic about this game's future, and I will definitely be spending a very large chunk of my time playing it. Goodbye, social life! :D			"

												The game is great at It's current state but the game has so much potential to be much more. The crafting system is very nicely done and the building system too but I think It could be improved. There is so much you can do it the game that playing alone isnt the best idea. Im playing with a firend for about 4 days and we only built one small wooden house. Although the progression is slow it dose feel more realistic and it can be fun once you complete something togheter with others. The game still feels like It isnt finished but the developers are still working on it and improving it every month so that's nice. I would recommend the game to those that will have like 1-2+ more people playing as well.			"

								This is one of my favorite games right now. I have enjoyed the game since first day alpha release. The new Direct X11 graphics look great, and the game has great potential. I love the idea of molding the landscape to how you want it. It pleases me to make changes to all of the terrain. I like the combat system that allows for KO and death. Taking damage to certain parts of the body is a real nice touch too. I have followed each patch of the game, and I like the way the game is developing. Most of the things that I have an issue with in game are going to be changed and corrected soon. This game is a work-in-progress, and I don't know why others want to expect a full version at the alpha release. I can't really go into what I don't like since the game is constantly changing. Looking forward to what is to come! :)			"

												Well, I enjoyed playing before the last patch. Not so much after. I know we are still considered testers...even though we had to pay for that priviledge, but the decision making process here is poor. I'm glad you think you fixed mining, but as we are still TESTERS leave the IP piles in so we can test. We can mine and use IP to get bigger projects done for TESTING. Unless you start paying ME, I'm not hauling the amount of rock required to build some of the end game structures. I'm sure the same could be said for alot of people. The result...buildings aren't getting built, your game isn't getting vetted like it should be. The amount of problems I've encountered and have seen others encounter on an array of servers leads me to wonder how much pretesting was done prior to this release. The sheer volume of reports, conflicts, bugs, and errors is staggering. At this point in time I think another 6 months in dev wouldn't have been enough.			"

Early Access Review
								*EDIT*One of the biggest flaws with this game, shockingly, has absolutely nothing to do with the actual gameplay. Before I get started, I want to say, I am a fan of LIF:YO. I have invested 300+ hours into playing this game, and am extremely in love with the concepts brought in by the actual developers. And I have to say, no one wants this game to succeed more than me. However, as a fellow gamer, and enthusiast I feel I must bring this to the attention of the uninformed. And I do not do it to dismantle or deface. I do it because these issues MUST BE FIXED.  That being said, I'd like to get started.Life is Feudal's development team is shady.Now, it's unclear as to exactly who is calling the shots, perhaps it's known, but I personally do not know. What do I mean ""Shady""? Well, let's see. There is poor communication between LIF Development team and the community. Month long silences and lack of actual updates on what the company is trying to achieve, progress and just really anything in general really define a bad public relation. Think: You've just sold 10k copies of your game, and you haven't updated us on what you're doing?I've been part of Alphas and betas before, and this is possibly the worst Alpha phase I've ever been apart of.See, when you ask for money NOW in order to develop your game. You're expected to keep your users updated. And updated on your main site for everyone to see. WE expect to know what is going on. We want to know upcoming content, we want to know what you're working on, we want to know what issues you're having, what preperations you're taking, interviews, insights SOMETHING ANYTHING.You won't see that here. You see, LIF actually USED to kept us updated, even with the smallest of details. And personally, that was important to me, it let me know that the Dev team was passionate and working hard, and fed me the information I needed to know. But after the game got Green Lit, COMPLETE RADIO SILENCE. AND THATS WHAT MAKES IT SO SHADDDDYJUST LOOK After Steam sales: http://i.imgur.com/Fq3uL2G.pngNotice THE HUGE TIME GAPSBefore Steam sales: http://i.imgur.com/oMzj5bv.pngIt feels like the Devs made the quota, and are just messing around, losing interest on development. And that's TERRIBLE. I MEAN, why else would the live streaming, and daily posts just stop? Absolutely Shady, and unfortunately, that's not the end of it. This next part of my review is so unsettling and anger inducing to me, I have no idea how I can present it to you guys. See, if you thought that Alpha without any insight or progress reporting was pretty shady, this next part is going to shock you. LIF:YO DEVELOPMENT TEAM MANIPULATES INFORMATIONWhat do I mean by that? I mean that every single element that does not favor them positivly IS REDACTED. ARE YOU SERIOUS? Is this F*** North Korea? Take a look: http://i.imgur.com/EkatQwy.pngThis is a post that was quoted by a user, that was posted in reply to what ""Bobik"" posted on the discussion board. The original post was deleted, as well as the actual post that Mr Bigdad posted. I was actually around at the time and saw the content of the original post. However, I cannot recite it word for word, I can tell you exactly what Bobik posted in essence. Essentially Bobik admitted to not expecting development to be getting ""far"". A comment that would essentially hurt the publicity of the game no doubt. When development doesn't think it's going to make it, it's sounds like a pretty screwed project to me personally. Any sense in a company would immediately do some sort of damage control right? Rather than going the safe way, explaining that things have changed and the future is looking much more brighter, extending a hand to the community. LIF Dev team would much rather DELETE EVERYTHING. DELETE THE ORIGINAL POST.DELETE COMMUNITY MEMBERS COMMENTS. DELETE DELETE. AND THENNNNNNNN~COMPLETELY F**** LIE http://i.imgur.com/sqXoNT3.pngAre you serious? It's like they have 0 respect for the community that they're expecting to pay the bills. Lying straight to our faces. They literally apply this practice with EVERYTHING. Especially users who leave negative criticism. Oh yeah, leave any sort of negative feed-back on their forums and discussion boards and guess what? ITS DELETED. SERIOUSLY?!?! http://steamcommunity.com/id/leewells2000/recommended/290080/I for one, am going to stop my support of this game, until BETTER CHARACTER IS DISPLAYED by this company. I want formal apologies to the community, and I want transparency of the development. Until then, I cannot, in good concious reccomend this game to anyone. AND THAT PAINS ME. By now I suspect alot of you have lost interest. And that's how it should be for any company who lies and cheats in order to maximize sales. Until these issues are resolved within management, STAY AWAY. Now if you guys want to know what the actual game is about, continue reading.   So what's this game about? Well, you create a character and assign it starting stats. You pick a faction out of 3 (I'm pretty sure this will determine building types later) and Name you Character. When you start, you spawn randomly in a world. (Currently one static map) and you are thrust into the role of someone who is new to the world. You'll need to find food and Shelter.    There's various skills that you can level up, by doing different things. And each skill branches off from base skills. For example, if you progress down Forestry eventually you'll get to Logging, and leveling logging will eventually get you into Carpentry. The system in which the game is laid out on, is extremely deep. The game gravitates everyone to work together, much like in actual old medieval times! The game naturally pushes you to work and play together, and not artificially either. Interactions with other players are intense and require you to decide if you want to use diplomacy, or perhaps just all out go agressive. Life is Feudal offers so much deepness that you'll quickly realize, that you're actually role playing the trade of your character. No other game has immersed me so much that I would play out the role of my character.     The game is all about building up a community of real players, who all do things that contribute to the betterment of the settlement. One of my personal favorite things about the game, is the Quality mechanic that they've introduced to us through the game. It is a genius and extremely well thought out mechanic. Every item, every building, every weapon, and every tool has to be crafted. And the only way to craft them, is by collecting the materials from the world. Every single resource, every rock, every Tree, every plant has a quality value. And those qualities help determine how well they perform when you craft something. It is a very welcoming mechanic, and adds a new level of deepness and involvement to the game. Overall, the game offers refreshing and mechanic rich gameplay that pulls you in and doesn't let go. At it's current form, it offers 40 Hours + of deep grabbing content. And while the graphics and interface are not up to par, we must remember that it is in it's Alpha Phase. And if one is being held back from experiencing this Gem of a game because of pricing, one can find solice that it is worth every penny.That being said, due to the issues in management, and the absolute S***ty public relations, I cannot reccomend this game to you. As a company as reckless and so willing to censor and lie directly to our faces comes with a stigma. This company needs to get it's s*** together and prove it can handle a single cent of yours. And sadly, it is not currently. And while the game itself may actually be addicting, it's completely USELESS if the company running it are unable to respect the gaming community.Thanks for your time.			"

								In my opinion, very very good.....but follows the pros and cons. after that see my comments in general:PROS- Good graphics, good fps even with a reasonable not top of the edge machine like mine- Almost no bugs for me!- Free world to do whatever u want.....build, train yourself, kill etc- Not hard to learn (lots of stuff in wiki etc and easy game mechanics)- Good ppl base- Lots of skills.....learn as you go and perform....but ppl abuse the chance of getting that easily cause the company allows it (see below).- Can build tons of stuff and they do have a purpose (like protecting your stuff, getting betterweapons, doing better gear for pvp) etc- Amazing easy, crafting that has a purpose (I guess I said that)CONS- Servers created by players. For me this is bad! Specially when the devs give them the right to change a lot. The servers colapse a lot couse its too much or dont load......Alpha or not, its anoying- You can create a server with 100 multiplier on skill gain....What? Maybe de devs didint wanna have the labelof grinders in their game, but a sandbox should have some.... You shouldnt max out your forestry skill in 1 hour. I tried to create the server myself...no luck........hours on end waiting....but it might be the day or the flux of ppls. BTW I choose the default which is 1 multiplier for skill gain and thats it.....No one would join me but I dont care. Games like this shold be a process, specially in community......It takes time and effort..... "

Early Access Review
								Amazing. So much fun. Although in early development it's still an amazing game. Some people are giving mixed reviews and I don't think they understand what an early access game means. From when I bought this game the devs have added so much content and consistently fix issues and I will say there are not many issues to begin with. Also a lot of people complain about not having access to features shown in the game. It is as simple as the devs 1. Havent put content in yet, because as stated above it's EARLY ACCESS and 2. they request feedback on the potential adding of said features from individuals in the beta.In conclusion, ignore the ignorant gamers who fail to understand the simple concept of Early Access and knock an in-develpment game on simple things as a bug that they refuse to report to the devs but expect them to magically fix without knowledge of it.

								Did originally write a negative review because it says it is single-player, and it was different to how i thought it would be.However, I have since played the game online with a community that I know and it has been great fun. This game would not work as a SP game as you can only have a certain amount of skills, it would involve making a lot of alt characters. Game has a great sense of community spirit and you build a lot faster if you all help each other out. I am having great fun with this game.Still, if you are after a single-player experience I would not recommend this. But honestly try it out for the multiplayer anyway, you wont regreat it!			"

								If you cant handle a real game then dont get this. I unfortunatly didnt get this game for a while because of the reveiws, but Im so glad I purchased it. Yeah the game is grindy but its a realistic survival game. The goal isnt to be able to build a giant base in one day. It is supposed to be hard so when you do build something you have a sence of accoplishment. They are relasing a huge update to the game Nov 17 that makes the game so much better so anything that you see is a negative review has been fixed. Unless its a minecraft carebear crying because its too hard.			"

PROS: It has awesome roleplay aspects,Its very realistic in terms of graphics.Lots of good servers with active admins and such.CONS: Though keep in mind that this game is still in beta. You will experiemence some sort of optimization while in the game.			"

												A brief summary of my experience of Life is Futile.1.   Got conned into buying by one of my friends.2.   Joined the server he was on, with high expectations.3.   More friends joind in, we started to have a merry band of men :D4.   Collected wood, plants and grass (enough wood to start my own version of Ikea and enough grass to fuel the whole US cattle industry for a decade).4.   Worked as a collective to build our own vision of Utopia.5.   Some guys in Knights armour turn up and try to bully us.6.   Spent hours learning skills and crafting our own weapons and armour.7.   Find out the King has sent his trusty Knights, also find out the King is a bit of a cretin...8.   Got together with others on the server, who dislike the King and plot a treasonous rebellion.9.   Usurped the King and declared myself ruler.10. Find out the King is friends with the admin and get our whole group banned from the server.11. Repeat step 2-10If you are happy being a peasant and working for others, this game is for you. If like me, Hitler, Pol Pot, Stalin, Saddam Hussein and Barack Obama you want ultimate power, rent your own server!When the devs implement bridges, I will claim one and guard it like the Black Knight from Monty Pythons Holy Grail...Until that glorious time comes, Life Is Futile will be a bitter sweet memory.P.S. Lost count how many servers we got banned from...			"

Trust me, hunting is so much fun xD- Raid other bases, but beware of the consequences! People are nice in this game, until you start messing with them!- Do honorable PVP. Most people do not attack out of nowhere, but some do, and it makes for some interessting battles.- Trade with other people and guilds! Best way to get stuff early game, is to work for others, to get some rare ressources! Ask around in Global chat, people are always looking for someone to do their dirty work. :)- Tame your own horse, train it, AND MOUNT UP! It really feels awesome riding around the lands, on your sturdy steed !- Craft your own weapons and armor, and look like a bad♥♥♥♥♥!- Dig a mine. Remember to reinforce those tunnel walls, or else.... :P- Weather & Season system!

								Engaging game all the way up to when you need to start mining, which takes an extremely long time to accomplish. Playability is sacrificed at the expense of realism. However, the game has potential. I am hopeful improvements will increase playability in the future. Also, I had issues with running the game in stand-alone mode. The server stopped working even after several reboots, re-installations, reading forums about how to fix etc. I ended up setting up a separate dedicated server to resolve the issue. A lot of players will not be willing to go through those technical pains after paying for a game just to be able to play it.			"

Early Access Review
								The Game is great! I have over 400 hours for a reason and likely to put on a lot more. Things to remember: its early access and not the finished game, you play on player owned servers currently and all have their own sets of guidlines and rules, also different rates and maximum skill leveling abilities. The game is very craft centric so expect some aspects to be a long grind.So far the game is very craft centric. You can blacksmith, build homes and castles, farm, tame animals, mine and log, if you can think up a craft in a fuedal era more then likely you can do it in game. To do this you need to collect resources or work out a deal to have others collect them for you. All of this and every aspect takes time. You will spend a lot of time building up to the point you envision your character to be. This is very grindy and definetely not for everyone. If the thought of spending a day or so moving dirt to level off an area to build your cabin makes you ill then you should move along. I never thought I would enjoy it as much as I do. I some how find the game very relaxing.I am not sure how I feel about combat. I havent done much PvP and have not leveled up those skills significantly. It however feels a little floaty to me at the moment. It however has a more urgent feel to it then other games, as death or unconsiousness bring permanent penalties, whether its just loss of property or loss of skill and attributes, you wont want to make defeat a hobby. I know seige warfare is coming if not already out and that sounds very fun.Claiming property is relatively new. It protects your land from intruders by making it so that tresspasers can be punished without any of the negative affects associated with murdering neighbours occur to the land owner. Also gives some penalties to the tresspasser. Its a nice touch.The graphics are beautiful, yet not otimized. I expect further improvement with that as it gets closer to a release. Some animations and sounds still require work, however the game still does an excellent job at being immersive and mostly natural.All in All this games is very good and definetly deserves a positive rating.

												At the time of this writing I have spent over 2500hrs in game.  That is over 100 days of game time.  What have I to say about my first 100 days?  You will grind.  You will become the grindiest grinder ever.  If you stick with it.  If you like games that will keep you coming back to finish what you started then LiF:YO is the game for you.  If you have the attention span of a tea spoon?  Maybe not so much.Finding an active server with an active admin is a big help in LiF.  Finding a server that suits your play style is very important too.  If you want PvP, there are servers for that.  PVE?  Yep, there's servers for that too.  I play PVE because I like to build and have alot of Netflix to watch but LiF offers many opportunities for many different play styles and schedules.Overall, like any game, there are frustrating aspects.  Mostly tea spoons crapping up the landscape with fences and furnaces that can't be removed easily.  Horse drawn carts are still not a thing and terraforming will suck the soul from your breathing corpse.  There are also some real positive aspects.  Community, a sense of accomplishment, different types of game play to suit your needs, a very deep skill tree and the feeling you get when you finally figure out how to do something and get to pass that knowledge on to someone else because you've been there and done that.Oh yeah, the wiki is so out of date it still predicts Hillary will win.  Should probably work on that.			"

												I am not one for reviews, but i believe this game deserves one.  A quick backround of myself, i love mobas and fps's.  Something i can pick up play for 40 minutes and put down.  This all changed when this game came out.   This game is a grind, but the rewards are much better than a piece of armor every two weeks.  You and a group can literally build a city.  Every skill has an important function in the game, unlike most games.  This game was well planned and for the most part well implemented.  I recommend this game to everyone, especially my legacy mmo guys.			"

Built alliances, backstabbed alliances, rose to power, fell from power, got molested by peasent girls, got lost in woods after drinking 3 ciders had to fight a pack of wolves, just to get away and run into a bear who one hit me, woke up on a beach naked...10/10 would drink cider again, get lost in woods again, and get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by bear again.

								Progression perfection.... Almost.  If you plan to play, I suggest a 10x skill server until the game releases, 10x will take a skill from level 1 to level 70 within 2 hours, from level 70-90 within 2 hours, 90-100 within 2 hours. 10x might feel like you are progressing too fast but the truth is that it's only unlocking things you can do. You can only progress as fast as the crop and item crafting timings take.When they say 100% sandbox, they are not joking. Currently there are a few irritating things such as tunnelling but for the most part, the sandbox aspect is pristine.Combat as of now sucks, if you're looking for pvp then this game isnt for you "" At The Moment "". Once the combat is fixed, this pvp system will be the least OP system I've ever seen. If you can click a mouse you'll be pretty good but that's not all there is to it, swinging the curser back and forth will actually make your character swing accordingly.Buildings are at a wide variety as of now, but I really really hope they add more due to the fact that on 1x speed the construction skill will take days to skill up to be able to build simple buildings.... Please please please DEVs, add a WIDE variety of buildings to destroy the grind of building ovens and destroying them to waste 1000s of clay. I don't even want to mention the Wattle-Fence-GrindAnimals are endangered species as of now.Skills seem to be at a high amount but in all honesty there really arn't many trees to go through if this is to be an MMO, the only professions as of now are Blacksmith, Herbalist, Architect, Farmer, and Hunter. Might as well not even count the Hunter because if everyone goes a pure, each profession could be a master Hunter as well.Rate 7/10 "

								I will try to be brief...I do not judge based on potential and will change my rating if in two years this game is complete and warrants a better review.  (In my experience people seldom have incentive to finish a project once they all ready have been paid).The game is so boring that even when you log into a ""pve"" server sad bored players all run to kill you with a two handed sword...once you are killed you will respawn on a map that is so small that someone will kill you again before you even get your hotbar set up (you will be naked at this point and your skills will drop below the minimums because of the death penalty).The game is not intellectual at all, those that say that it is must be the types that don't know milk comes from a cow.  It is very intuitive and typical of survival games.  However this is the most tedious one in history...it feels like the game makers are trying way too hard to keep players from progress because there is no content. I will discuss only two of the simple tasks made horrible.  Digging...digging is so slow and boring I could LITERALLY go outside and dig a larger hole in half the time it takes inside the game...(I am talking clay soil folks).  Eating...to make it feel oooohhhh scarrry you will have to eat 40 roots in a single day to keep your health up...A human can go 3 weeks without food in real life but for some reason game makers want to make you eat like a pregnant 10k lb Hippo (hungry hungry hippos).  Oh, did I mention it will take about an hour of your real life to collect 40 roots and you will have burned up about 5 roots doing this act LOL.In Conclusion...if you have $40 burning a hole in your poket, have never played a survival game before, and don't mind someone boosing thier low self esteme by keeping you from even playing then you have found your game...otherwise wait two years and see if they even finish the project.

												WARNING!!!! This is not a game for lazy people xDFirst of all! The bad reviews of this game are for two reasons: 1-on alpha the game had some bugs, low fps and low graphics; 2- (most of that bad reviews) - people who dont like games that you have to work on it to get something.There are two types of games: games like CSGO,Battlefield,COD,etc  (games where you start with all of your weapons and you just have to play it) and games like this one ( games where you have to work hard to have your stuff).This game is for the people who loves medieval era, roleplaying, pvp, and work like maniac! Dont get me wrong this game is amazing and with a lot of potencial, but for you to have sucess you have to have a lot of time invested in this game and playing with your friend help a lot too.So what you need to know. . . When you creat a character, you can choose what you want it to be (stats, professions, looks), when you log in to the game you dont have any tools just cloth and some food but you can get tools from the nature arround you and then starting to craft and raise up your stats and professions.Crafting system: very complete i must say, you have a lot of things that you can create but you need to have the skill to do it. Combat system: is kind of diferent that you should expect, it takes a little of pratice but for this game it works pretty fine. When you are try to do some damage every things counts, lenght of your weapon, quality and combos that you use.Pros of the game: really hardcore miedeval simulator, roleplay, community, crafting and combat system, graphics are most better then the alpha version.Cons of the game: Optimization, the devs are still working on this subject. If you want to run this game on ultra... well you can dream about it xD You need a really good graphics card for that, but in medium that what i use and i have a gtx760 i run the game at 130 fps +/- depend on the server, so its getting better.I advice you to see some youtube videos, tutorials, streams and studd, if like what you saw, buy this game, its a really good game. Is that type of game that i was looking for so many years. Tip: 1- If you can wait for some sales and buy this game always save some money;2- Buy the game before MMO is realease, because when it realese the game porbably will be more expensive and if you have bought this game before mmo realease you got one character slot for free on mmo.

												Complex Community based game; not built for casual lone wolfing. The Vanilla version is grueling in Your Own, but the majority of servers run moded versions to make it more small group and time friendly. This game rewards players for making intelligent and informed decisions, and punishes players that don't fully think out the value and effect of their actions. Most of the punishment is in the form of excess grinding.  "

								  I got in the game, didn't know how to move.  Imagine that I hit Escape and see that pressing Tab turns off my cursor. DUH! Now I can move.  Now what? Well pressing keys randomly, theres TONS.  A skill tree, a backpack, a paperdoll for my equipment.  A stat List, all lockable and raisable/lowerable.  You need to start at the left and work your way right to do stuff in the skill tree.  Before long I chop down trees, stack them in piles.  I dig a copper and an iron mine, build a forge.  Then a Kiln.  Before long I have a Blacksmithy and Anvil.  WHOO Metal weapons and armour!  Woman seen me play, ohh noes! Now she's farming! Growing crops / tending the stables.  And Sir Noc is Born, riding his warhorse, armour and weapons.  Who dares trespass in MY village I worked so hard for.  Heres some apples pesant, now beat it!			"

												The MMO version is updated often, but beta tests are far and few between unfortunately.  There are certain features that are only sensible, such as horse drawn carriages, but there always seems to be underlying coding to be taken care of before adding new features.  LIF:Your Own is hardly ever updated, and receives little to no attention.  With that being said, I am sure once the MMO is in its final Beta stages, many features may be moved over to :YO seeing as the MMO is more of a testing platform than :YO is.  With that said, this is one of my favorite games I've ever played.  It comes with a heaping helping of GRIND, and feudal life at it's best.  The crafting is lengthy and difficult, and combat is very reliant on practice.  Because it takes so much time and effort for the littlest of things to be accomplished...  It feels just like that.  An accomplishment.  Few games nowadays make you feel rewarded for putting in effort whatwith the silly achievement systems and the buy-to-win and free handouts methods of games to keep players playing.  To really work for gaining anything has its own reward when you get it.  Reminds me of questing in Everquest.  Difficult and very lengthy, but damnit, you earned that Ghoulbane!Would recommend.Waiting for MMO to complete. "

								This game needs a warning. It is mostly grind. You will grind to get resources, you will grind to move resources and you will grind to build. Pretty much most of your time will be grinding. If you don't play this game with other people, then you probably will be burnt out. I would say that if you enjoy Minecraft and working with other people, then you'll most likely enjoy this game as well. The sense of accomplishment from building a castle or large keep is pretty great. If you say, ""I did this."" Then people will realize how awesome you are, because of the many months you put in to build that castle or keep.What I don't like about the game?Takes forever to build end game buildings.Everything has a timer. Digging has a timer, mining has a timer, gathering resources has a timer. You can pretty much calculate how long you will spend to gather resource or calculate how long someone else spent building.If you are just starting out, gaining levels is mostly grind. Joining someone else's establishment and using their tools and equipment allows you to level up fairly quickly compared to that initial player.There is no automated way of moving resources and trader carts for moving resources is slow.Loading times and lag. For some servers, I can take a shower and come back and just be entering the world.Game can feel like a second or third job as you are cleaning the barns, stables and coops.What I like about the game?I like to dig. I dug in Minecraft. I dig in Life is Feudal: Your Own. I'd probably dig in the MMO if I was going to play it.There is something about the game mechanics when playing with other people that give a better sense of community. You are sweating and crying together and that gives a bit of comradery. Griefers can't currently destroy your buildings. They have to work at doing anything too destructive, for the most part.The role play is what you make of it. There are some pretty good role players. "

								Great game with lots of promise. It takes a while to build things and level up which is great for longevity. My only problem with this game is the MMO aspect. Everyone on here bangs on about how great it will be when there are thousands of players running around. Umm ... great ... so all my hard work will be undone in the style of Rust. Can't wait. I've heard there will be more things to do if you want to play solo, but I'll see how and if that pans out. I can't not recommend this game - it doesn't have dragons or spells which is refreshing. Don't get me wrong I play solo which is still great as I love all things medieval. Only issue is they've made a fantastic game but without singleplayer, which seems to be the norm these days. I'm sure it's great with a team of you but not everyone wants that. I just wish there were more games like this but in singleplayer. But this is the best so buy it and go solo - and hope more NPCish aspects get added. The rendering on the buildings look wonderful and the cities people have built look amazing. I'd quite happily spend days or weeks or months building it all on my own - just wish there were a few (just a few) NPCs to say ""hello"" to. At least there are animals to kill I guess.			"

								Bugginess/state of the game:I've spend a few hours on the game. And it's occasionally buggy and not well optimised. But hey, they're not hiding the fact it's not finished. It's playable, that's the most important thing.If you can't handle a crash once in awhile, don't buy it.I haven't had much issues, but some friends have had it worse than me.Gameplay:I personally love it. But if you're an impatient man, do not buy this game. Doing things takes time.In most survival games you have a full fledged base in maybe a week or even less.Here 1 weeks worth is having a small house and furnace (if you play alone) or a village with wooden palisades (if playing in group).Now this game is not meant to be played solo. Many server have the recommended level cap. This effectively limits you when you play alone, as you can't have all stats maxed. You can do everything decently, but not perfectly.There are server where the cap's been increased, so you could technically be a one man powerhouse.But more often than not, expect there to be roles. Towns tend to have a dedicated blacksmith, carpenter, tanner, etc...This game takes time, especially being a bloody herbalist..... there's just so many freaking herbs.If you don't have patience, don't buy it.If you like a community and working in group building up a medieval society, go ahead. Expect to shovel a lot of dirt leveling out land though.Watch out for bandits aswell. People still love free goodies. "

												I highly recommend this game, its gots some bugs which still need to be ironed out such as the Memory Leak and random crashing but this is still in Alpha and these items ARE being addressed by the Devs as they work on the MMO, which I'm sure these type of fixes will be applied simultaneously to both versions.  This game provides a nice balance of Survival/Builder/PVP Slasher all rolled up into one package, think Rust/ARK + Chilvarly/Mount & Blade/War of the Roses All rolled up into one grand Mediaval Simulator.

								Having played 1,017.9 hours of this Alpha game i am still not disappointed . even with all the hickups and problems i have experienced along the way. I am pleased. Support has been quick, regular patches - implementations of game material and fixes.it should be noted for new players there is 1 modification to a steam file that will significantly improve your game experiences.  . In my experiences Since purchase i have played across many servers . Raided , constructed , terraformed, farmed, hunted alongside many players who have had alot, if not the same playability concerns . though once you work a few bugs out. this game is awesome in its open ended gameplay. Which encourages players to work together. Ive found most of the ♥♥♥♥♥ing and whining to come from players with high expectations who are expecting a polished out of the box RTR version, or players who are generally not up to a hard grind type game to achieve anything and just want to troll around killing and not working towards anything. Of the playability problems this game has a few, and most of those problems vary from player to player .  most can be sorted with a little bit of fiddling with settings and such. What else can you expect of an alpha.. well worth the $40 i spent. but be prepared to put in some hours to enjoy this game to its full potential.. you wont be running around decked out to the max overnight . or even in a week for that matter . you need to play the game for what it is to enjoy.   ive since started a server of my own and we are setting up community's and infastructure etc . planned events on a scale we havent been able to achieve before .. currently the only server that isnt dead from what i gather from feedback from players. goodluck i hope you purchase and would like to see you in game . if you are from australia .. all the best			"

												Overall: great game!It will keep you entertained for hours. If you are a right player type for this game you may spend even hundreds or thousands of hours.Yes it is a niche game - really hardcore one, meant for elite groups of dedicated players.Some will not like it for been to in-depth and too grindy at a times, but this is what it takes to feel the significance of your achievement. You invest time and feel yourself proud when something is finished. This make you don’t want to lose what you achieved, because usually it will take far more than a day to restore. This together with so called “alignment system” makes players behave themselves in-game and in general  community is far better than in other sandboxes.Some say there are bugs and visual glitches... well they were, but devs are quite fast - 2 patches in a first 2 days after release and they were fixed, at least for me. Performancewise not that bad actually. Taking that I’m playing on rather old gtx 680 on PC and not so fast 850m on laptop - avarage of 30 FPS on medium to high settings make me feel comfortable.And the last but not least - this is not for a singleplayer mode. It is possible to start a server for yourself and tune its settings to play with decent comfort, but it is absolutely no fun at all. The point of this game is communication between people, friends or foes does not matter it will be fun in both ways!So I highly recommend this game. Get some friends and start your feudal life!			"

It will take time.We set up a little camp in the valley, only to realize that we were miles away from the materials we needed.It had taken us about 2 hours to get set up, and really all we have is a bed roll, furnace, and some tools.So I ended up being the one to have to travel to go get the materials for everything.Nonetheless, I like it.It's very pretty, and the atmosphere is on point.8.5/10 "

								This game holds a lot of promise, and it looks like it's going to be a lot of fun. It's richly detailed, and the graphics (for a game of this Minecraft-esque premise) are very good. To say it's even in ""alpha"" stages, however, strikes me as a gross exaggeration--even in spite of the ""early access"" label. Basically, all you can do is perform the same limited set of functions over and over, and write bug reports--something that used to earn minimum wage, plus all the coffee you could ever want. Before you shell out $40 for this game, bear in mind that ""playing"" it constitutes what used to be called a ""job"" at this point in time. It's very, *very* incomplete, riddled with bugs in every function, undersupported by its help functionality, and exceptionally confusing. In my personal opinion, while--again--it shows every sign of becoming a great game in the future, it's not very entertaining at all as-is, and doesn't merit a price tag at the present time: the developers, if they can't pay someone to play it or handle the playtesting themselves, should be farming it out to family and friends for assistance, or trying to crowdsource additional development/playtesting funds, or doing *something* other than saying ""Hey, this is worth $39.99 right now.""

								This game is AWESOME! Its been ages that a game could keep me nailed on a chair for 13+h in a row... This game deserve more attention! Game Design, graphics, everything makes this a great game. Everytime you think well iam getting there there is a new option and a new Reason to start Terraforming again. Even when you get bored at some point doing the same thing over and over means that your playing it the wrong way (Like i did) Just watch the community's out there for nice how to's so you dont find yourself right kliking / selecting every dig (like i did) hehe. This game is for when you want to create something but want to take the time to do it. There is however a creative mode where you can have some advantage but i advice to play the most settings vanilla. Iam rly srr for the bad english! Great job on this game Guys!			"

								If you are a fan of Wurm Online or perhaps have played Wurm Online and wished there were gameplay improvements that will very likely never come, this is a game to look into. Life is Feudal: Your Own is a title which is temporary, a proving ground if you will for the MMO component which is coming supposedly in October. At 3x3 KM squared it is not a large game world right now however the developers have stated a significantly larger world will exist for the MMO in October. There are of course glitches and bugs as well as UI issues just as in Wurm Online as the games bare many similarities but in my opinion the game is already in a better state than Wurm Online is to this day and contains far less of the major issues that I have with Wurm Online. I can recommend this game to anyone who has played Wurm Online or enjoys games in that vein. It certainly does NOT deserve the negative reviews it has and if anything it simply has a learning curve that seems to turn some people away.			"

												I highly recommend this game, some people are spooked by the ""mixed reviews"", but be scared by it. I bought this game for $24 and it's certainly worth it. If you're bored out of your mind and looking for some REAL RP, get this game, you may spend hours chopping wood and levling skills up, but its worth it. The only con I have found is finding a good server, that is the hardest part of all, but once you've searched around, got around that big learning curve and understand it does take days, even weeks to get a good village going, you'll be happy with this game. But I only recommend this game if you have a good PC, if you do not, you WILL have issues as the optimization isn't that good. I've spent over 100 hours now & I still have not done everything in the game. This game is a solid 8.6/10			"

												Dont Waste your money - Devs dropped the ball big time on what could have been an amazing game  The promise of sandbox pvp has been replaced with  safezones and carebear tears- the actual build and engine are horrible and clunky - most servers grind to a halt after a week or so of light terraforming and building - 1/2 hour load times on restart are normal on 1 week old servers - lots of bugs and glitches but thats normal for an alpha build crafting and building system had a lot of promisepvp is horrible - not really sure what direction devs are taking but those whoe know more about melee pvp than me have said the game will not be releasing with a good pvp system in place  devs like to delete any negative threads on the steam forums and the official forums so you won't get any real info at either of those places. underhanded behaviour of the highest orderEdit - june 16 2015  Total biscuit review jsut came out - confirming prretty much everything we have all been moaning about  - final conclusion from him   - DONT BUY THIS GAME- currently forum mods are removing any threads rreferencing this review by Total Biscuit - like i said very immoral development company -17 Nov - release day  Game has been released in an unfinished state as we all expected it would be - - End product has been rushed in an attempt to squeeze last drop of cash out of this dead horse- to be honest i think this company's behaviour is verging on the criminal and wish Valve would not give these kind of shady developers store space Do your self a massive favor and spend your money on a game with a future; developed by a company who you can trust and interact with			"

												I haven't played in awhile after dropping in a little under 150 hours and most of that was spent on a private server I set up for the BF and I when I first downloaded it. I really liked it at first, but I found the lack of NPCs or at least things to fight other than wolves a bit boring. I love the building aspects of it and the whole farming/cooking/hunting/fishing bits (which is what I played in game) but even when playing with others for a short while, I found the Role Play to be kind of non-existent, as if people thought it was silly to actually play the characters they created.I also didn't like how, get the wrong mod, and all of your progress could be wiped the moment THEY had a screw up but I guess that could happen in any game such as this.I'm currently getting hip to Wurm Unlimited, which I think is where LiF got a lot of its inspiration from and I find it to be a bit more enjoyable as of now. Sure the graphics aren't as pretty but there's much more to do, including getting down on an Adventure server so you're not so dependent on PCs to provide content.I'll probably end up playing LiF again though. Like I said, it does have its fun attached to it and I'm sure if I found the right server with the right players I'd truly enjoy the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the roleplay aspects. Sometimes I wonder if its just difficult for some PC gamers to switch to a ""table top"" mentality. But all of this babbling is just my opinion.			"

												Don't let the mixed reviews deter you from trying this game. I admit, it isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy more slow paced, realistic, sandbox type games, this hits that sweet spot. Yes, it takes a lot of time to accomplish things, and yes you will need at least one or two other people to play with in order progress very far, but what results is a far more relaxed and social approach to the online survival/crafting sandbox genre.This game doesn't hold your hand and can be very difficult to learn how accomplish anything at all, but once you do figure it out, everything feels like a massive accomplishment, which is rare in games these days. As a result, the time you spend in game feels far more rewarding than other games of this type and is well worth the investment to learn it properly.As I said before, it isn't for everyone, hence the mixed reviews, but if anything I mentioned above sounds appealing, then it is certainly worth a try.

The developers promise that the MMO version will be interesting, but it seems to me that this is not true. I'm starting to think that this project is only for money. Today, I do not recommend this game. Let's see what will happen next.			"

												""You know you addicted to a game when your computer is toaster and you have to play it with minimum settings just to run it with 26 fps""This one of those games where your fun is decided by server and its players. If you are in active server with active gm-s and events/rules you are going to have fun time. Game itself has only basic elements (combat, crafting, building), server administrator/moderator or guild has to decide how the gameplay should be. For example: Players build trading area and make rule, that this area is no combat zone (written rule). There is no function in game to make it safe area, but gm-s can enforce that rule with kicks and bans.The skilltree got it own pros and cons. I like how you first have to too level up skill A to get access to skill B and you cant level up everything cause skill point amount is limited and because of that you need to coop with other people to get mats from skills that you dont have. What I dont like is that if you want to level up archery you have to have leather armor, to get that you need to have farming, to do farming you have have construction, to do construction you have to have mining and so on. Ofc you can skip all that if you find someone who can craft leather armor and is willing to trade you.When it comes to trading, game got no currency. So trading is done items-for-items and because there is no currency you never know what is valuable for others. You can ask in global chat, but lot of server got rule - No trading in global. In my opinion having currency would boost quality of gameplay a lot.Building houses and other stuff is something that everyone prolly like to do. Building is very time consuming escpecialy when you are alone. Building basic constructions that you might need like furnace or anvil can be easily done alone, but building fortress or complex housing needs time and having right skills.I recommend not because ""it got potential"" or what it going to be in futured. I recommend it cause I had more than 50 hours of fun and if you are into building, co-op and roleplay you are going to have more than 50h of joy. Also the development keeps moving on. I have heard that they are trying to turn this into MMO, with bigger map. So I ques they use this game as test out functions that they are going to have in MMO version.When it comes to bugs, I did not encounter any gamebreaking for me, but I also have not tryed all out like sieges and large scale battles. Biggest bug or glitch I had was wolf falling trough mining sealing and attacked me. Surely this aint game for everyone. "

												This game is a medieval life simulator, not so much a true ""survival"" game. It does indeed have survival elements but the focal point of the game is PVP and a very in depth and lucrative crafting system. While you may wonder why the game has some mixed reviews, it's mostly because it is a very hardcore game that fits with only certain personalities. Also a lot of the negative reviews were from a while ago when the game was riddled with bugs and people were upset. That's changed a lot and is now a mostly polished experience.Solo play can make the game difficult, and jumping into the world with no friends or unable to find people can make you feel extremely overwhelmed. Most servers have a very awesome RP community with it and if you find one with good rule sets you have ample opportunity to grow your character into something special. Having a group though even if just a few people is a MUST. I cannot stress enough solo play is highly discouraged. You want to focus on a certain few professions to specialize in as you can be a ""jack of all trades"" but to get the maximum reward you want to specialize. PVE content is sparse besides game animals there isn't anything else other than starvation that can be PVE, so if you're looking for ONLY PVE this IS NOT the game for you. Understand that PVP drives the game, but crafting is really the most important and time consuming aspect.As I said before it's more of a simulation, giving you the ability to immerse yourself in that middle age time period and reap in rewards. Crafting is top notch and is extremely gratifying just doing something as simple as terraforming to plant some trees or dig a tunnel system to mine some ore.It isn't for everyone, it is a game that requires patience, time for your effort to reward you but once you get into the world you will be hooked. I've loved every minute and the RP I've had is just so fantastic. Once this game turns into the MMO it will be even better.The game is not without bugs, however none are game breaking, the inventory system isn't very friendly and the UI can take some getting used to but there are tutorials and a very good wiki to assist you throughout. While the price tag on this game is a bit high, you can justify it by the fact you will get a game that isn't like all the other survival games out there that end up being a waste of money and get abandoned. Combat is physics based and if you've played Chivalry it's very similar to that so it should be familiar.. I rate LiF:YO a solid 7.5/10. If you love crafting, survival, RP, PVP and medieval times this is a must have to your steam library.			"

Its a game where stuff takes time doing, making it a game you can sink a huge ammount of hours into, more or less relaxing and enjoying yourself while doing it. Obviously best played with a group of friends. Highly recomend the game for those who are interested in survival games that isnt too arcady, takes a bit of time and rewards good cooperative play.

												Reccommended if you wish to support the development of the MMO for the future, and you wanted a game that is Minecraft with skill trees in a high definition world.Not reccommended if you dislike the feel of alpha games and do not wish to deal with bugs and/or crashes. If you have the desire to see an MMO that will rival Minecraft's sandbox and overcome WoW's limits, and have the spare cash, pick this up on sale. The sandbox features are promising while the progression is self rewarding. If you do not enjoy grindy games, or not wish to risk your money on a game that is basically a proof of concept for a future MMO, no one will blame you.I personally got my own copy from an excited friend who wanted to share with me, and I urge you to read this review in a neutral mindset instead of positive or negative. I cannot say yes or no for reccommending this game.			"

												Life is Feudal is not for everyone.  If you are completely unwilling to play with open world PvP (despite probably one of the best anti-grief systems around,) want quick action on a constant basis, want to gank people without any resulting issues, find the idea of needing other people to do much troublesome, or just don't like a slower pace where building and crafting your community is big goal... then you likely won't enjoy this game.  *Note:  you can play it by yourself and use GM commands, so if you just want to craft away slowly and enjoy the island in the :YO version... then much of this doesn't apply!*First, the game is very crafting heavy.  In the Your Own version this can be worked around with GMs.  However, that all depends upon server rules for multiplayer.  In the MMO, crafting will likely be a large part of your content.  Crafting requires other professions, and has a little more complexity than your standard MMO fare.  It isn't something that will leave you guessing, though, like many other systems do.Second, the game has systems for wounds, decaying gear, building decay, etc.  All these things need to be taken care of, along with food and possibly thirst.  Additionally, your character can become exhausted and need to rest.  You will have concerns other than just what to hit next.Third, the game uses a physics based combat system.  You must aim and time with ranged attacks.  You must aim and time with melee attacks.  If the damaging part of your weapon does not make impact you won't see much for results.  This will be something some like, and others do not like.Fourth, the game is not finalized in many ways.  It is released for this version, but more work and improvements are still being done (just the focus is now on the MMO.)Fifth, the game uses a time basis for a number of things (trees and plants, growing herbs in the garden, raising your alignment *which relates to the anti-griefing system,* etc.)  Darkness is dark (unless you gamma adjust... which I wish was not the case but oh well.)  Dealing with good time management will get you more than working without it (although you can get around that in this version.)The Developers are consistently on their forums, and interact with the community.  They take a lot of the feedback we provide and work on making the game better.  I highly recommend anyone with an interest in the game to look at some of how the game plays, to ask questions of the community and developers (they are on various social media as well as here,) and to consider what you want out of gameplay.  If you are looking for a long term game with social ties, building a community, and dealing with the various other aspects as talked about this may be a game you really enjoy.  If not, you may wish to pass.  The game is not for everyone, but for those who would enjoy such things I do heartily recommend it.			"

												In my opinon, this game has so much potiental to be a very successful game. It is one of the best survival games out their on the market. There is so much that I want to talk about the good and bad about LIF but this is a review so I'm going to try to keep it short. Even though it may be the best but their is still room for improvments to satisfy us gamers. ""cough cough, morning lag""There are some flaws but I cannot think of any ATM unless you consider ""morning lag"" to be one of those flaws.The crafting is amazing and there is a diverse range of players (with good or bad ethical gameplay). The game design of the enviornment is beautiful and UI is customizable. I enjoy the option to do some role playing with other players in the game, it just makes the game so much more enjoyable.  Overall, I recommend people to try out LIF (life is feudal) if you enjoy similar survival games like ""Rust"".YEARS LATER...LIF has improved and excelled so much with new redesign, gameplay sound tracks, new items that help players to survive and features. There is so much that I cannot list all without boring you.Sadly, there is still morning lag. I also like to mention that there is thing what I call ""HORSE LAG"" because the lag is horrofic when your ride either by just yourself in a medium to fast pace. It is even worse when riding your horse as a group of horse back riders.Those haters of the game just don't appreiciate what this game has to offer. For those who find the huge learning curve of the skills is a hassle. Then you know what, there are other games out there that come with a huge learning curve too. If you haters like to play easy games, then go play minesweeper and call it a day. These haters are not gamers, they are CASUAL gamers.  For new players wanting to try this game. I highly recommend it if you are into medival styled RPG and MMO. Plus you new players will pay a smaller price tag than I did when the game was still in early access.			"

												Brutal is a good way to discribe this game. Nothing will get done fast unless it's death and if you go in looking to build a town or even a house in a few minutes then you are in the wrong game and should go back to Minecraft. dedication is needed and is rewarded. Playing with friends is the best way to enjoy this game but you can do it on your own if you want to.  Time, everything takes time and nothing is fast. This is not a game for those looking for instant gratification. Most people play 1 maybe 2 hours and give up because it is so brutal and so time consuming. These people then give the game a thumbs down.  Had they been more patient they would see a great game that rewards you for your dedication.			"

												I had this game for ages in my wishlist never quite found the urge to buy and play it. Now after it got released me and my girlfriend finally found the time to play it. And oh boy we just could not put it down. Even though it walks the line between tedious and rewarding with mixed success it has a certain appeal and ambition when it comes to it’s huge amount of crafting that has to be praised.It is to minecraft what the arma3 is to call of duty. Everything requires time and planning. Everything is a bit more complicated but the smaller things are that much more rewarding. And did I mention time? From your primitive tool up to your crazy fortress requires a constant combining of skills and crafting to the point where undertaking huge projects must be tackled in a group. Unless you are truly insane and your rent is payed for 10 years in advanced.On a sidenote make sure to join / create a server that has the right settings for you and or your group. Nothing worse than building a wall only to see it go up in flames a few days later because object decay was on or to high. You also might not want to grind your teeth every time you try to level up your skills. Server settings could make or break this game dependant on what kind of playstyle you prefer. Happy building!

												The actual gameplay itself is very fun. The sandbox experience in this game is great. Interaction with others is basically unlimited. Full loot, open trading, full pvp, everything goes. The combat is ok. It is somewhat skill based with combo's to learn and memorize, but also level based.Here is the problem I have with the game............. Servers.Hosts come and go, maps get reset, devs get egos, it just never ends. I found one good server that I stuck with for hours of gameplay and one day the devs shut down the server.... Just the way it is with this game.The gameplay is great if you can find a server you enjoy.			"

												I have played the game substantially more and really wish that I could change this review to recommend, because I think the game developer's intent is in the right place, just executed horridly. It really gets a “meh” more than a no. This is why: (all of the bullets tie into each other at the end)SKILL SYSTEM:  Skill system is built around you not playing as a lone wolf. While it is possible, the skill tree does not exactly allow you to accomplish this task without an unreal amount of game time and multiple characters. 2 or 3 would be needed in order to craft all of the different items. Not saying this is a bad thing, just something the solo gamers need to be aware of.MAP SIZE:  Sadly, the map ""appears"" to be larger than it really is. I have walked the island several times now, just to take in all of the different terrain features and how everything is laid out. The map suddenly gets smaller once you do this. Truly.UI ISSUES/LEARNING CURVE/EMPTINESS:  Steep learning curve due to a fairly poorly implemented UI and overall game mechanics, in my opinion. I joined a good group of people and really got taught the ropes and while I started to understand the game a great deal more and was more successful. The emptiness and game quality around me persisted. The animals run like Ultima Online servers during live world events over 20 years ago. Not kidding you.BORING WORLD:  Wolves, boars, bears, deer, moose, and every other creature in the land is stiff. Everything is like a still portrait of animals who do not move unless you step on their tail. Even when being shot 20 times with arrows, ""peaceful"" animals walk 5 feet and stand still. Why do I need to shoot a boar 20 times to kill it? Heck if I know... tough boars in this game, I tell you what. Took 15 arrows to the face and nothing. Every animal of this game is offspring of Chuck Norris.NOT SO MUCH LIKE LIFE:  Master Hunter? Don't worry, you still can’t tell the difference between a hare, deer, moose, or sow. Maybe my character’s intelligence was too low to tell the difference. LOL. Stupid mechanics.SERVER POPULATION DISPARITY. Server sizing is one issue that really gets me annoyed. None of the servers are DEV run. The servers that are up, either have 0-20 players or are full during most peak and sometimes off peaks times. 64 players is simply too small to make this game enjoyable, especially if your friends are on a popular server. Which means you need to make the map bigger…which leads me to my next point.SHANTY ISLAND OR NO MAN’S LAND:  The servers have a tendency to be filled with players every hundred meters or so sporting a shanty hut, or you are left to rot on an island by yourself.FAIL ADMINS: You are at the mercy of the server admins. Some server admins think it is ok to kick you, so their buddies can get in. Or if you didn’t upper case your character’s name. Didn’t happen to me but one of the people in my group. I am looking at you RPCLiF… fail. What is to stop them from kicking you when you beat them in a fair fight? Nothing really.TIME SINK:  Total and complete time sink to an unacceptable level. While I do love to play games that allow you to mold your character and really build a city from the ground up, I don't want to do this in game with real time. If the skill increase is default, quit your job or fall behind. You will get your butt kicked by the unemployed and retired.BOTTOM LINE:  The game is really fun if you have a lot of time on your hands with a good number of friends. Join a lower population server or better yet, create a private one and try to have some fun with it. Joining the wrong public server could leave you and your friends with nothing to show for a great deal of hours’ worth of work. Middle of the road to a little bit below. Avoid buying it unless it is on sale… like 80% off or more.- - - - - Initial Post- - - - -My initial impressions of this game, regardless of all the thumbs down I may (will) get: Total and Complete Boredom.Once you get the hang of your first few crafting tools and make a few different characters, while you jump from server to server trying to find other players. You begin to see how dull the game really is. Community involvement is deplorable. The servers who say “new players welcome” are seemingly the worst and have very little to actually offer new players.The world is empty. Seriously…looking for group? I started my adventures running through the woods and see a deer, but little did I know that was going to be the only deer I would see for the next 2 hours. As I already stated above, the player base is so tremendously small, you spend your time running from walled up keep to another walled up keep. The only player interaction that takes place in global/server chat is poo-talking back and forth. If they speak at all.A game without NPC’s is a great idea, except for one really big problem here: You made the map size tremendously big with a 64 player limit. Hell, I’d like to see 64 players in just ONE of the keeps I passed. In its current state, the game needs NPCs in order to prevent the thought that I am playing by myself in a building sim…with very limited creatures. I started to feel like Gilligan, but even he had company.Tutorial is outdated. How can the tutorial be outdated already? It is in freaking development! If you are going to make a tutorial, at least make sure the UI you are using is the same as the videos played for new players. Largely because all it does is confuse the living freak out of the player base more. Oh but “it’s early access!” - get over yourself. The excuse is 5 years old now and does not excuse every problem a game has. Some stuff is just lazy.			"

								OH GOD WHAT AM I DOING !!!Is what a lot of people are shouting right now and that's fine, it's a brand new game that only a minority of gamers will know how to play from the get go. But have no fear because once you get the basics of the game it really starts to open up, the best thing to do if you want to get in to LiF is to go here and give this page a look over https://lifeisfeudal.com/billing/tutorials.php doing so will get you to the point where you can ""play"" the game instead of running about like a headless chicken. You done that ? no ? yes ?....... ok good moving on.So LiF is not an easy game, if what you were looking for is a game where you jump in and are a Badass from the start then no sorry this isn't for you, if you want a Single Player experience with AI and a story then no sorry this isn't for you, If you want a community centered game then YES this game is for you, there are no Shops, no Guards, no Doctors/Healers, not even a building in sight, this is not Skyrim or Mount and blade, if you want any of that then the players have to Be/make that. And it takes time for that to happen, i've played this game for 7 hours straight and all i got done was chop some trees down, catch some fish, make the ground flat, mined for iron and found nothing and smacked a wolf with a shovel. But during all that time not once did i think ""oh this is crap, this is boring, i'm going on another game."" you know why ? because it's all new, it was fun not having a clue what i was doing and i still don't. One thing i will say though is try and band together, don't just wander out in to the wild and try to make a house because you'll be at it for days and i mean IRL days.			"

												Luckily I bought this game on sale so I only threw out like $20Let me make this short and sweet as I can for readers convienance. This game is a hellah grind, both level wise and mental wise meaning if you want that big awesome looking keep then you better be prepared to scoure the land for every little piece of wood, stone, thatch, and oddly shaped animal skin nessicary to build it (Thank almighty God for infinity piles) The developers are being sketchy as ♥♥♥♥ about more then a few things and without a good group of people to play with you might as well not even try. The combat system in this game is a joke, It is literally faster and easier to kill people just running around bare♥♥♥♥♥naked with zweihanders, you cant see arrows in flight both from archer or victims perspective. Dont even bother building wooden walls and lastly you wont do much else from beating a stick against a rock without investing some SERIOUS time into your server. It seems almost everyone is out for you just for the hell of it and there is really no proper usage of horses yet and player animations are SUPER exploited.Do I think this is a bad game? Certainly not....oddly kinda fun and satisfyingCould it possibly be more than a time sink one day? AbsolutelyDoes it need a nerf and rework in many areas? Oh hellah yesAll I am trying to say is that it might be a good game one day and is fun in the short-term but until the developers actually buckle down on it and start having more and better updates and add some MAJOR patches to this thing and desperately needed content this wont be much more than just another regret. Simply put, dont bother logging hours in this game until it gets alot further along in development and actually gets polished out alot more to the point where it is playable beyond something of a trolls breeding ground.Guess it is true what they all say, Life is Feudal			"

There just isn't enough combat to go around, especially on a private server with 10 people.

								I know it's in Alpha stage but this game isn't ready to be released yet not even in alpha. I wish I wouldn't have spent the 40 bucks on this. If you are looking for survivial games they're much better games in dev for almost half the price. I think in a few months this game will be absolutely amazing but for now save it. -Connecting to a server is problematic and if you can't connect to a host you have to completely exit the game.-You need expert computer skill to start your own server so creating a private server for you and your friends is no easy task. You can't go to gameservers.com and easily get a server hosted either. One company does server hosting but you don't get the full game experience with your own server.-The controlls are really clunky.-There is hardly any wildlife or things that move it's extremely lonely. -It's like Dayz without zombies and you can craft but you need friends to help you but finding friends is a hastle.

												Wow this game is pretty awesome, but wait until they update some more and when it's stable.Edit :Ok so I've had it for 3 days and now I have 30 hours. This game is awesome, the crashing was fixed THAT DAY. I haven't crashed since, the skill system is so in depth, if you like Archeage style crafting then this is the game for you (and it doens't have that stupid labor system (can I get a ""whoop whoop""), you work up the ladder and eventually you're a master at a profession, or a few! In time people will know what you are good at, and will call you over to their village, whereupon you will exchange goods if need be, it's quite fun. Won't even go into the battles..let's just say I got pillaged yesterday and was not happy.Edit 2: Still enjoying myself, get this game if you like to craft/work with others. I am now a traveling art dealer.Edit 3: 97 hours in the last 2 weeks? Game is still amazing, so much to explore and learn.Edit 4: Hmmm just get it.			"

												At this point in development, the enjoyment you get out of this game is pretty strongly correlated to the quality of the group (guild) you play with and the server. This game is really one where you HAVE to work together, especially on servers where the settings are close to what the MMO will be (600-1000 skillcap, 0.5-2 multiplier). However, now that the guild claim system is implemented it can be very rewarding because everything within your guild monument's claim is protected.   As other people have said, it is a pretty slow paced game, which makes it realistic, but I find a lot of newbies don't seem to grasp that. You have to put in a lot of time and have patience in order to get a settlement going and get armor and weapons. And even then, if you're playing on a pvp server, you still need to put work and time in your settlement to improve your defenses or another guild is going to surpass you technologically and wipe you out.  If you're doing multiplayer (where most of the fun is to be had), I would highly recommend using teamspeak, mumble or the like for your group. Communication is essential in multi.  All in all, I've definitely got my money's worth out of this game. This style of game and the way the devs have implemented most things so far seems perfect. I can't wait for the MMO. EDIT: Jan 2016, since I've written this review (March 2015) this game has gotten so much better. Almost everything is implemented, graphics are improved, dx11 optimization kicked in, and with horses and siege weapons it just seems so much more complete. Definitly buy this game and join a settlement. In-game or out of game. Guilds are always looking for players who are smart and willing to contribute because it is a two-way street. Everyone benefits from having more crafters/gatherers/buildiers/warriors/specialists to help them and to help out.			"

												Good, solid game. Interesting, in-depth gameplay. Few bugs, efficient game.9.5/10After close to 100 hours, I revisite this review and must say that lot of different things are constantly drawing me back to this game. I found it well built, like, moreso than usual early access MMORPGs / Survival. Maybe for a good reason because it's been in development for 4 years, mainly through crowdfunding. Also, they're indie. Indie forever :D :DI think their engine scales well for various PC capacities, and it has a very distinct feel and style to it. The gameplay is smooth, although rather slow in its execution, and that's exactly what I was looking for. It is a early medieval/dark ages, realistic, skill-based, open pvp and combat. I like the deep, complex crafting and ressouce gathering and management. The game is very complete in terms of what activities/skills can be used, from building, farming, landscaping, hunting, taming, riding, fighting, resource gathering, resource transformation, tanning, dyeing, etc. The more you use a skill, the more skill points you gain in that skill, but it is capped, and the characters can be modified and continue to evolve in different ways to fit your playstyle pretty much forever.The game is also evolving towards a full-fledged MMO (its currently 64 players max per server) on a gigantic map, which is currently in closed Alpha. It will eventually open to all owners of the game. So there's very active development and huge future.			"

												I haven't put as many hours as others have put in. I was drawn in by my husband who has put in more hours than I can count, and wanted to include me in on the fun. At first I was skeptical, but as I played it I found I really enjoyed it. I enjoy the challenge that the game gives, as you travel and struggle to find the best resources available to build your village/town/kingdom, and when you complete it, that sense of achievement that you built something awesome.Now with every new release and update there's going to be glitches. It happens, but the build team has been attentive to the issues and do work at fixing what's wrong. That being said, I look forward to seeing the progress of the game as I continue to play. The glitches are minor on my end, so it's definitely not an End All for me, cause I know it takes time to smooth things out. I definitely recommend this game for gamers who enjoy this kind of Genre.			"

I got it in a humble bundle, and it still wasn't worth my time. By ""realistic"", the developers meant ""lots of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking action menus and bad animations"". The survival aspect feels trivial and the gameplay overrall is clunky. As it stands, this game is some kind of engine for people who want to roleplay as medieval citizens. There are some good ideas behind the combat, but the game overrall just isn't up to snuff.If you're looking for a survival/crafting game, there are simply better products available.			"

												This games environment and ambience in general is very beautiful. I obtained this game just recently and i have to say that the game came a long way since it was first released. Everything is designed to give the person playing a ""life like"" experience. You literally feel as if youre in the game yourself as there is so much to do, hunt, build, and etc. Making or joining a community can be great and very interesting for the most part , as this game is completely community based as your gameplay goes on. For these reasons and a perhaps a few others, i say that this is a really great game to check out.There is a negative side to things though, but in this review im going to focus on the character creation. The game does not really follow the aspects of its own title...well the ""YOUR OWN"" part. I believe the idea of the game was to in a sense, self insert yourself into the game; put yourself in the open world to fend and make the most of yourself. But i see that really difficult when there's only 3 races you can possibly pick in the game. Knowing the intention for their game, why did they decide to give the player no variety on races? It beats me. But i think this is something that should be thought of in the near future.Everyone who plays this game will not be white or asian (hence the 3 races are basically White, white, and asian). So from my perspective and probably others, the lack of variety makes it somewhat hard to have that ""self insert"" vibe when playing. I see it as a major factor  that if took into consideration (as in adding races that resemble the african american, spanish, or indian race and so on) this will enhance a persons enjoyment and experience in the game when they can make a character  that represents themselves and possibly their culture in RP.Other than that, as i said, i would highly consider to try this game, because overall, you will not be dissappointed.

Early Access Review
								This is by far the best early access game that has been made, in possibly ever. however, just like every other early access game, it is plaged with bugs, glitches and other such things. so if this type of game is not somthing you have been dreaming of, i would suggest waiting a few weeks/months before picking it up. it has a large amount of features that work, unlike other early access games, but it can be frustrating to get stuck on somthing, because the items you need arnt implemented/fixed yet. all in all, for me PERSONALLY, i would rate it 11/10, but that is only because this game is litterally what i have wanted to see from video games. but for those who dont dream about video games, i would give it a 8/10 for its Current level of playability.

												This game has real potential, so long as the developers keep actively working on it. It says release, but it's more of a beta, as planned features are yet to come and some in-game features are still a bit buggy. It's also yet to be optimized and suffers from crashes and memory leaks. Definitely not a game for everyone, as the learning curve is steep without joining an established guild and the chances of surviving alone are slim. Also has a lengthy skill leveling system that will make some impatient players unhappy.Before you buy, I highly recommend looking this up on YouTube and getting an idea of what you're getting into. It's an excellent game if one can overlook the current issues - which the devs are actively working on. But, with all its cons, the medieval life you will lead in LiF:YO is extremely satisying, especially when you build your first house or complete the walls around your lands.			"

								The game is still alpha in every sense of the word, exploits and glitches are found and used by some players, yes this is annoying. Game lags and crashes at times yes this does make me rage, but only cause I enjoy this game greatly.I have said the bad above now on to the good, the game is designed to create a community, a fraction, a guild not a stand alone warrior. You will need other people to rely on to make you tools while you tend the land or have you back while being raided. Had good laugh with my clan The Mountain Men as we marched in full plate armour around the island demanding tribute or defending trade allies.People have made some great villages and towns, fortified and locked up tight with archers posted on the walls, you start to get concerned for you trade goods as you approch, even more concerned as you walk away after the deal is done.What is annoying is a lot of negative comments are done by people with low hours of game time, I was still learning at 100hrs. People complaining its only to fund/test the MMO, its the same game/code essentially, so kinda but not  the reasons they say.Is it worth the $40? for me yes, very much and I am looking forward to the MMO.If you are a little worried bout the alpha issue, wait easy as that.ThanksBourbonated "

												Life is Feudal: Your Own is a HUGE project, shame that for now the servers are empty!The ability to create anything you want, or worlds makes it an endless game.But for now it's still too ""immature"", if it is played in single, boredom comes after a few hours, partly because the loadings are VERY long.Still remains an interesting game that when played with a friend could give a few hours of play, and also rewards.In short, Life is Feudal is a game with the potential, but to date, considering the price and servers ""often"" empty I do not recommend it, but in a few months could prove to be a really good game!https://www.youtube.com/my_videos?o=U (Below is the Italian full review)  Gioco realistico in stile mediavale, dove devi creare mondi, terre, oggetti e quant'altro.Visita i mondi creati della community, oppure prparati a creare un modo totalmente indedito! Features:  Possibilità di creare mondi, città o addirittura tunnel.Diversi stili di combattimentoPossibilità di creare personaggi ed aggiungere caratteristiche personalizzateTecnicamente di alto livelloCo-op Online  Parere personale:  Life is Feudal: Your Own è un progetto IMMENSO, peccato che per adesso i server siano vuoti con mondi poco caratterizzati!La possibilità di creare qualsiasi cosa si voglia, o mondi lo rende un gioco infinito.Ma per adesso è ancora troppo ""acerbo"", se viene giocato in singolo, la noia viene dopo poche ore, anche perché i caricamenti sono MOLTO lunghi.Comunque resta un gioco interessante che se giocato con qualche amico potrebbe regalare qualche ora di gioco e anche soddisfazioni.Insomma, Life is Feudal è un gioco con del potenziale, ma ad oggi, considerando il prezzo e i server ""spesso"" vuoti ve lo sconsiglio, ma tra qualche mese potrebbe rivelarsi davvero un buon gioco!

Early Access Review
								Summary: While this game is pretending to be everything it fails to become anything in the foreseeable future.Yes, the game has absolutely no future except being an early access title until its distant demise. Yes, it will be early access for very long time. Take a couple of years.It is ridiculous how with such large gameplay scope developers fail to design even basic features and mechanics. It's not even interesting to study the design of the game as it is usual with other early access games.There are several very obvious evidences that the game is designed very poorly. What is bad about design flaws? Design flaw is much worse than even a hudred bugs. You just can't fix it without destroying some part of the game. And one design decision is always connected to the others. Redesign is a chain reaction that involves most part of the game to be reconsidered and recoded.As it is usual happens with independent developers they pay very little attention to a game design. They jump to start coding and modelling. Well it's good if you're designing another simple puzzle or arcade game - they tend to have very short development cycles. On the other hand - games with such gameplay scope as LiF have very long development cycle - about a year. It means time needed to code a tech demo after design revision.This development cycle we have now is already wasted. Next development cycle will be wasted too. Not just because developers are bad or something. But because the game system will be so complex that there will be unexpected results.To prove my point, here's some design flaws.1. Terraforming.Terraforming system is purely artificial and is a subject to heavy changes in the future. Right now terraforming consists of too artificially combined systems: landscape terraforming and tunneling. It is very easy to see that tunneling artificially blocks landscape terraforming in its vicinity. That's just because developers have no idea how these two systems should interact.Terraforming lies in the basis of the game so any changes to that system will result in a redesign of the whole game.There are so many questions that needs to be addressed here. Will there be a cave-ins? Can you build a house inside a mine? Maybe a farm? Do I need light inside? What if I will dig upward to the surface?2. Skills.Right now there are too many skills in the game with very little logic behind them.Let's say you want to be a hunter. Track animals and kill them to get hides and meat. Not so fast. It seems you have to learn how to plow ground first and grow crops. And only then you will be able to dry a deer's hide. That logic.Same problem with terraforming, prospecting and mining skills.There is no obvious way to choose some simple role. Skills are divided and interconnected in some weird and unexpected way. Obviously skill system will be revised very soon. It's just awful.3. Skill cap.Well, I bet developers are very proud they have ""invented"" a such an original way to milk LiF MMO players for money. Of course you will have to buy character slots. Why else this skill cap is even implemented? You won't be able to create anything in the game without 3-4 different characters involved. That's the only reason.The worst of design flaws are those which was made to make us spend money. Because you can't fix them and they ruin the game the most.4. Hunger.It is the best example of a system that haven't even been thought about. It's a typical placeholder. And yet it's the most important system. It is one of the reasons to make players settle in some place. Some place where they have created a food production chain. If you won't be able to make them settle - they will be roaming around freely to kill and destroy. Because it's the natural pastime of human beings.Right now you don't have to hunt, fish or grow crops. You only need to make weapons and armor to kill someone.Well, I'll just name few more problematic mechanics which have to be designed yet.5. Quality migration.6. Private property.7. Claiming lands.8. Criminal acts.9. Water travel.10. Howling-transporting goods.11. Deconstruction.12. Siege.13. Off-line characters.14. Tracking down criminals.15. Trading.... and much much more.It's sad to say that developers doesn't even bothered to study some references. Like Haven & Hearth, for example. It's obvious they have played it. Yet they haven't analyzed it's design decisions and flaws. And they already trying to invent something ""new"". While they only will end up reinventing the weel.Edit: Fixed mistake about skinning a deer. It was about drying hides, not skinning.			"

								Latest update added decay into the game for items on the ground (animal bodies, grave stones, bag loot) which is all well and good were it not for the fact that they gave people little to no time to pick up their items from the loot bags and into ""proper storage"". My group alone just lost 300+ flux/mortar after this patch, an item that is hard to create because its only found through the use of their terrible herbalism system of which they think so highly of (please stop comparing your herbalism to the elder scrolls herbalism system, thats laughable.) and in doing so has cemented my opinion as a not recommended game, 40 dollars is far too much of a price point for a lot of promises and no logical actions on the devs part, plus all of the deleting they keep doing to the comments ive seen on their forum is sketchy at best.

								Very deep crafting. Has a good economy of players required to build a cities/towns. Combat could use some love (which the developers have confirmed is one of their first orders of business). The graphics look pretty damn good and performance is good as well (Lower detail on trees or else it'll be a slide show). With sped up skill-gains, it allows players to experiment and try every profession relatively quickly. Anything from tracking animals and setting traps to keeping the fire of a forge high tempature for smelting. Two of my favorite mechanics: When you hit track animal, actual footprints show up in the grass and you can follow them to find your prey. When you search for herbs, herbs will appear in the vegetation around you and you must spot and gather them manually.			"

												The game has certainly gone through its ups and downs over the development lifecycle. The dev team has been really involved with the community and implemented many of the ideas we had to improve the game.  Even though the game is a ""full"" release now, it doesn't mean its not continuously being updated and improved.  The ""full"" release was done when they implemented the initial features they said they would from the kickstart backed campaign they ran.  This game is just a small nuget of what the eventual end product will be for LiF.  This game is a very good world suvival/simulator and has exponential possibility.

												This game looks preaty nice and has lots of potential. They are updateing and working at it and i as a developer starting out can probly understand there challenges they face with the game. I like this game because it reminds me of a Ultimate online variant with down to earth veiw.  Pros- Nice graphics - lots of things to do if you have the patience to work on it.- Great game for freinds to play togeather.-Controls are alot more stable now but there is still lag when you enter a claim. Push ctrl-f4 to turn claims on permantly and it resolves lag issues.Cons - Annoyingly go to clicker mode after every action, so starting i got consfused how to make my character turn (push Tab) this controll needs to be set to default in look mode.Ill update more on this later but for now i will continue to play and explore.

								The game isn't bad, it just needs some smoothing around the edges.  For example: They DID update the game to where the FPS is more smooth. But for a game that isn't even near done, it could have a lower price.  Luckily, I got this as a gift but I experienced buying something that is way more than it really should be.  I really think they could also smooth out combat and make the graphics a little more enhanced.  I do recommend this for the people who enjoy this type of stuff, but for the people that just want a game to play and get really into without having any problems, then this isn't the game for you.

Early Access Review
								So, Life Is Feudal – what a spectacular game concept and with the level of developer commitment that has been displayed thus far, I am excited to see what the finished product will look like.  Let's just get the summary out of the way so you don't have to read a wall of text if you don't wish to do so.  I will detail everything later.The Summary:LIF:YO is a stand alone game that is being developed completely separate from another project the devs are working on (MMO).  The price tag is a bit rich for an Early Access game, in my honest opinion, but that $40 was well worth it simply due to the fact that have on record almost as many hours as many of my “fully polished” titles in my library.  There is plenty to do but at the same time, it is very possible to hit a brick wall until other features are added or tweaked.  Overall, if you like a game that simply takes time and effort to create something very cool and organic, this game is for you.The Deets:You start off with nothing more than the rags on your back.  It is up to you to find a suitable area to sustain and survive.  Is the game possible to play single player?  Absolutely with some tweaking of settings or multiple characters.  Is the game more fun to play multi-player?  By far!  Either set up your own server or join one to play with more people and make the game really exciting.  Build up your defenses, barter with your “neighbors,” master a skill set that no one else in the area has mastered to make yourself a more valuable asset to the community.  All of these things take time and effort to accomplish, but the reward is that you have built something to truly take pride in.  Fixing a broken down wall isn't as simple as replacing a couple blocks.  It takes mining materials and the skills of multiple trades to raise the wall again.Resources are diverse enough to offer quite a bit of exploration and travel to various locations.  Are they a bit too sparse?  Maybe.  But for what the game is now, it feels appropriate.  Use the materials you have to refine your skills and make higher quality items for trade or protection.  The possibilities are numerous!There are quite a few bugs... there's no denying that, but the devs seem to be on top of things as long as they reported accordingly.  There are some balance issues within the game that make it falter.  Again, the devs will surely address these before the game is finalized (hopefully by Q3 of next year as they plan).  The UI and combat can definitely feel clunky and unresolved, but over time, it will get more and more optimized to better suit the needs of the game.Essentially, what you have to remember is that this is an Early Access game and there are going to be bugs.  But if you can past those bugs, horrible optimization, crashes, etc. and realize that the game offers far more positive ideals and possibilities, you enjoy the crap out of it.			"

												I really can't recommend this game. After a whole day of grinding, I barely even built anything. The crafting system is unintuitive and the tutorial is very poorly designed. You have to equip tools to be able to craft stuff even if you're sitting with said item in your inventory. Everything takes forever to make, so long that I wonder if this wasn't meant to be played with 20 friends! It's really grindy with absolutely no reward at the end of the day. Even though it's been out for quite some time, it seems unpolished. There are visual glitches in the animations, no help system included and the battle system feels like it belongs in the 1990's. Think of this as a cheaper 3D version of Runescape, with no monsters, no animals, and no one to play with.			"

								This game is steadily being updated and allows for slightly new experiances every so often. The game is pretty much a big empty island with very little to worry about except starving to death, that is, if you play alone. This game needs to have a good size community to play with as you will be able to create towns, castles, trade routes and of course war.The gameplay itself can get rather slow at times while you grind away at raising your skill, but if your playing online you will constantly be looking over your shoulder trying to find someone whos not supposed to be there and instantly go into a defensive posture as you slowly approach them. Because after all.... Life is Feudal.			"

								Listen guys. I have put a lot of time into this game. If you go to the wiki to find tutorial videos, mine are the ones that are posted there. I think it is pretty fair to say I know this game. The reason why this game has a mixed reveiw status is because it can take A LOT of time to get into this game. I understand why some people are put off. If you are a gamer who doesnt like to put more than an hour or so in to a game to get good at it, then yes, this game is not for you. Yet if you are looking for a rish and deep imursive enviroment to spend hours in, that rewards you for doing your research and working hard, then this is your game. This game hits the nail on the head so hard when it comes to medival construction that it may feel tedious at points. I really do recomend getting a few friends together who all want a great experience so you can thrive, because just like in real life, you are not a one man army, and it takes a village, to build a village.

Sure there is no tutorial for how to craft stuff. But the fun is going online and finding out how. You dont want to know how to do everything in one way how. You could be know the craftings of only a Blacksmith or how to build or make food and not know anything else. Thats the main fun. The other fun thing is how the guilds work. They arent like a regular MMO medival guild. Its Realistic. Come home from work, hop on the game. Say hi to your buddies and tell the new people where you from. I met a guy today from Kentucky. He helped me skin a bear. And then, after that you do your job. And do the same. The other people who play for 9 hours guard or are the Owners of the faction. The System is great, and the people are very very nice. Greatest community I have ever met. Another thing that happened today, it took 3 guys with Scale armour to kill a beartwo went unconious the other fired like 16 arrows into the bear. They said it was dangerous for me because I had Leather.And so I went out, I found a bear and they warned me, I got knocked down sure and retreated to the water. I then slinged it and retreated. Slinged it and retreated. About 50 Slings and it ran away but I slinged it about 4 more times. It sat down and it got tired. Finally it died after 8 more slings. I got the Black guy to come, Everybody was amazed at what I had done and I felt like this was the best game I had played this year. I am waiting for more to come                                                                                    REALISMThis game is trying to be realistic also. With the way the AI act to how long crafting and growing trees are. I would love it if there would be guids with huge factions with Neighborhoods with about 6 people in each house and a Kingdom with about 50 people. Men and Woman (Woman that are Girls irl would be alot realistic then Fake woman) filled in the houses. It would also be great if there was random AI bandits. the AI bandits for the Wolves and Bears are great! Sneaking upon there prey. I stalked upon a Wolf and followed it upon Miles until it turned around and tried to eat me. It ran after it saw my buddies chase upon it. That was also a great feeling! It acts like real AI! Bandits or enemy humans would be a great addon with own tents and also expanding and also coming from the Ocean sailing with ships.                                                                             ONLINE: PLAYERS AND THE COMMUNITYThe players are friendly and feel like your talking to real friends irl. They are helpful and its unlike the true internet that insults with or on your Iphone with all kinds of Drama. I only have seen a admin have to ban a player for Sexually assaulting sombody and then trying to kill him. But I then heard he was a new player as his friend joined. The new players can also be very nice. This may be my first day but this is my experince. Diffrent then any other game I played. Sometimes the Younger players that are 12-15 would do somthing like hit you but as long as you know them well and you die close to a house that you spawn at. Best is not to scream at them unless your teamates do. A man named Jacob kept killing us in our own guild. But it was fun, we all hid in a barn and Jettman the owner moved and he found us all... But we were all having fun because we all worked hard on our skills and getting Resources so what else do we do? Going raiding is fun sure but I mean real fun.                                                                                  GRAPHICSThe Graphics are good. Includeing the Sun going down looked realistic not just going down instantly. It took time. I played on all Settings High and the game didnt lag or give me a bad Framerate either. Only a couple lag spikes. But I would give the Graphics a 9/10. I heard alot of people say the Graphics are good.                                                                            OVERALLI think this game is well done and not rushed. I never wrote this big of a review besides Arma 3. But this review means more then any other of my Reviews. I think the Dev's did a great job on this. They even reply to complaints. A review complaint was a guy that was banned because he said the game was boring in Early alpha. He later was unbanned because of his Review which changed. Other Developers dont do this. Other games ignore peoples bad reviews and ban them thinking it solves it until they ban half of there game. Everybody is nice. Give this game a try. Watch broacasts also to help. "

								Yah, I played it a bit. It was OK, I guess...In all seriousness though, I've been taking a break due to school and what-not for about five months, but I used to play the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it, hence the 1500 hours. It's an incredible game. I remember the first month it was out, the sense of exploration, real people trading with others, people owning bustling shops, real landlords with real slaves and farmers, real crafting specialists, it's all player-driven, no NPC's.It just got better and better, exploring new things, no developed Wiki to guide you through, and after a year it evolved into what it is now. They have built upon an epic, moldable foundation and the game has so much content to work with.Yes, it can get incredibly repetitive, but that is if you deny the way it is supposed to be played, and that is with others. In feudal times, you would have to rely on other to assist you in survival, it's not supposed to cater towards people who want to bolster all skills and survive on their own. A house needs glass, for that you need a smithing craftsman, It needs lumber, so that needs a carpenter. And then finally, you need an architect to design the house. You cannot adorn all these skills alone, so it forces you to rely on others which is something really cool.Bustling player-built cities, large-scale battles on open fields, struggles for resources and power influence, the things that happen in this game are endless.Right now, they are 64-slot servers... imagine everything I said above on a 10000 slot server, which is what is planned for the near future... AWESOME!			"

												The devs are active, and the current problems it has are the sort that money will fix. It is worth £15 not £25, in its current state, so get it during a sale.The player community is lovely, and in a way the game's mechanics encourage cooperative behaviour through roleplay and establishment of organisations such as 'kingdoms'. Individual players have the opportunity to make their own choices in a (sometimes) violent world, so there is a balance between gaining followers through public image and power.The 'Mixed' rating is because the game was put up for alpha in a state where most players experienced game-breaking bugs, this is no longer the case. The game is now about ready for release. It could take players directly from minecraft. Once the game switches to being an MMO they will be re-submitting it to the store, so the rating will be reset without the hindrances and I'm expecting positive reviews.			"

												Honestly, this isn't a survival game. This isn't like Rust, or DayZ, or anything else in the entire category of survival games. This is a unique Multiplayer Sandbox RPG, with a very satisfying atmosphere, a ridiculously deep crafting system, a deep skills and levels system, and at times a painstaking amount of realism. It's challenging, it's rewarding, and it's addictive. I bought it this last weekend, and then shortly after bought it for five others. We're all hooked.When you see a decent sized group all toiling away at their various jobs, it feels like the world is alive, which so many other games have failed to do. Honestly, ♥♥♥♥ing fanstastic.Oh and the weeaboos 10/10 would kill myself again did these kids learn to type by smashing their club hands into their ♥♥♥♥ing keyboards?			"

												Game is really great if you enjoy methotical gameplay and have patience. When you build structures, yes there are some glitches and stuff that need to be worked out but it is you should expect it if you are getting a test version. If you don't want the glitches and bugs then just wait till the actual mmo comes out. I have a lot of hours on the game and still enjoy what some people call ""grind"" of the game.If you want to check the game out before you buy it I would suggest watching some streams on www.twitch.tv . There are channels with different languages, so a high chance that the language you prefer is running. If anything my stream is running frequently. www.twitch.tv/baddiemanSo end result, I highly recommend getting this game. :)			"

Not only does it offer the physical elements within the game but it offers so much more fun times!   Game has very active Dev team and offers a lot of potential for the future.Very easy to be addicted and make friends! Rate: 9/10			"

								Tried this game when it first came to steam. This is a rather my experience than a Review.So. You came here to build a house? Okay lets start by learning the TERRAFORMING skill. Thats needed in order to become a CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS PREPERATOR.... (whatever the hell that is). When achieved a sufficient level (60 in most cases), by digging up ground for HOURS,  you begin preparing  construction materials, needed for your later home. Again, you do this FOREVER, till you achieved rank 60 in that skill. When you made it that for it allows you to learn the construction skill.... With lvl 30 in that you made it. after 8 hours of boring skill lvling, you think you achieved a point of mastery where you can finaly build a home, no, HOMES for many! But no. Lvl 30 in construction allows you to build WOODEN objects only. Well... okay. Lets start cutting down some trees you say? NO. FIRST LEARN FORRESTING (planting trees, examining trees, and getting branches from them), WHICH IS NEEDED FOR LOGGING. So, note that youve spent about 10 hours of gameplay just for achieving the necessary skills to build a house on that 1 particular server. Okay finally you can start cutting down those stupid trees you examined 50 times each. Well, some of them. THe hard wood trees are to tough for you with your logging lvl 30. After you cut down your first tree and wondered ""Eh what the heck do I do with that log now."" You realize that you have to learn ANOTHER SKILL, to make something out of logs. Yea Logging lvled to 60, CARPENTRY ACQUIRED. you start sawing those 1000 logs into the most beautiful boards mankind has ever seen and look at all the work youve done.... Preparing to FINALLY start building your home sweet home. You begin building your little wood shed... but whats this... nails needed?! FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-Okay you already learned Terraforming so, no big deal. Lets beginn with learning PROSPECTING. TO LVL 60, to be able to prospect for iron. After that you learn MINING, again to lvl 60, to be able to get the precious Iron ore you lust for and to be able to SMELT the Iron.... YOU NEED TO SMELT TONS OF IT, but only skill smelting to lvl 31 this time, because the next skill you have to learn, Smithing can be kept at lvl 1. Thats a present from the game designers to you, nails can be forged with a Smithing skill of lvl 1. 15 hours later, just after finishing a shaggy wood hut, the server crashes, disappears forever.GG, 0/10Try/buy the game when it became a MMO.

								""Un juego prometedor"".Life is Feudal: Your Own, es una versión previa a lo que será un MMO muy ambicioso. Por lo que he podido probar hasta ahora, os puedo decir, que el juego aunqu está verde, es funcioanl y puede uno hacerse una idea de lo que será el juego final cuando lo acaben.No compres este juego si piensas jugar sólo:Life is feudal, se puede considerar como un verdadero simulador de vida Feudal. Empiezas sin nada y tienes que crear todo de cero, pero no experes una experiencia acelerada como ocurre en otros juegos. Si bien hay servidores en los que la progresión está acelerada y puedes aumentar tus estadisticas y habilidades rapidamente, la versión final del juego pretende ser un simulador de la vida Feudal y bajo mi punto de vista bastante realista. Tendrás que crear herramientas primitivas que te permita recolectoar recursos para hacer otras herramientas más complejas y así poder obtener recuersos a su vez más complejos. Deberás crear tus estaciones de crafteo y hacerlo todo desde cero. Crear un horno, moldear la arcilla para hacer un molde donde más tarde verter los metales fundidos que te permitiran crear un yunque por ejemplo. Si piensas hacer todo esto tu sólo, posiblemente estés muerto antes de que puedas hacerte una choza donde estar a salvo. Es un juego de grupo, gestionar los recursos, esconder tus tesoros, hacer guardias. Nuestro personajes tiene un limite de capacidad. Lo que no puedas llevas encima, tendrás que esconderlo. Posiblemente debas hacer guardias con tus compañeros de juego para mantener vuestros progresos a buen recaudo. Necesitarás todo el espacio libre en vuestra mochila para poder hacer las labores y trabajos que tendrás que desempeñar si quieres que tu grupo progrese y se haga fuerte dominando estas medievales tierras. Debereis trabajar muy duro, debereis organizaros, hay muchas cosas que hacer. Hay que procurar comida para el grupo, recursos para avanzar y dar protección a todos los que estan trabajando en vuestro asentamiento.La politica será fundamental. Vuestra supervivencia se basará posiblemente, no sólo en el numero de hombres que seais, si no también en saber ser diplomáticos. Hacer alianzas cuando es necesario o dejar claro al resto quien manda en el territorios que estás trabajando.Todos querrán hacer su aldea y progresar, tener una fortaleza, un castillo y hacerse grande. Pero habrá muchos que no puedan conseguirlo y se dediquen a saquear al resto. Life is feudar es un mundo libre, no hay roles predefinidos. Se lo que quieras ser. Puedes crear tu imperio. Puedes vivir robandole a los ricos y repartirlo entre los tuyos. Quizas prefieras ser un mercenario y prestar tus servicios a un guild a cambio de un suculento botin, o simplemente explotar los recursos del mundo y proveer a otros reinos. O por el contrario, quizas quieras hacer de intermediario. Comprar los excedentes a unos y venderselos a los otros. Puedes ser un señor de la guerra y dedicarte a fabricar armas con las que comerciar con los reinos en guerra.... Las posibilidades son infinitas, porque las reglas las pone la comunidad. Y este puede ser el peligro y punto debil del juego. Es un juego que depende de una comunidad activa de jugadores y ahí estará el exito o no del juego. Lo cierto es que es un juego no apto para todos los publicos. Es un juego hardcore, no apto para cryer. Deseamos mucha suerte a los desarrolladores y esperamos que sean capaces de sacar el juego de forma sólida y sin dar oportunidad a los hackers para joder este juego.Yo por mi parte, lo he comprado para dar el apoyo al proyecto. Como juego a día de hoy es entretenido si juegas con varios amigos y una gran oportunidad para ir aprendiendo la dinamica del juego que es bastante más compleja y extensa de lo que a priori parece.En resumen, un autentico Sandbox simulador puro y duro de lo que sería vivir y progresar en un mundo medieval.Disfrutadlo.IMPORTANTE: No lo compreis si esperais encontrar un juego terminado y sin bugs. Muchas de los arboles de habilidades y progresiones aún no están implantados. Está todo en fase de desarrollo y aunque es jugable, no hay servidores estables y son reseteables. Tu personajes y su progreso así como los cambios que hagas en el juego están sujetos a que el server sea reseteado (y con ello la perdida de todo el progreso en ese server), cosa que ocurrirá más a menudo de lo que os gustaría.

I mean at first I thought that the crafting was a little hard but after about two hours of talking to some guys that pretty good at the game I got a litle better at it. I know how to craft stuff, like little stuff like one of the small huts. I never built anything bigger I just got the supplies. I love the game though. It is very early but is already pretty good from what I can see. So I would give this a 7/10 since it is not done yet.			"

												So my friends and I bought this game apon its release on Steam back in 2014? My impression of this game since then has changed, immensely. It went from a really rough game to play, performance wise to.. a really beautiful game to enjoy.. performance, graphic, and gameplay wise over this time since I initially bought it and up until now.The updates are weekly, and the Devs seem to be focused on the main goals. - Though with updates comes small errors sometimes, but they are quickly addressed.I come from giving countless hours to the games like, RoK, ARK, Rust... and various other games of the sort, and in these games you can go at them solo, eventually you might succeed in time.Unless you intend of being just a guy that makes the finest weapons in this game, even then you will need a partner to play with... so let me stop right there.This game isn't like most games. Read the title, you see that word ""Feudal""? It means a whole lotThis game will eventually make you rely on one another. It will make you want to become friends with that a##hole of a neighbor, because he has the goods you need.. and you might have the goods he needs.(Then eventually you blast his doors down with the supplies he traded you, then you need him no more.. heheheheh!!! ^.^) This game is a great game, it has molded into a great game. I hear stories of this ""MMO"" that is soon to be released, and I look forward to it.In all honesty though, I'll likely still be playing this because I have yet to experience the full ""Monty"" of the game on LIF:Yo.You can pillage, plunder, mine to the center of the earth and then drown yourself in the endless sea below.You can beat your friends up, and get rewarded skill points for doing it.You can be marked a criminal after constantly spying on your neighbor on his land, then go get blessed by the Holy Priest of Tamriel, go back kill your neighbor, and God still hears your prayers!I can't even write to you all the things you can do in this game, your best bet is to just take my word for it.. It beats RoK anyday, but as in time consumption.. lol it definitly beats it.So after this time of playing on the newly updated LIF:Yo I decided to rent a server and host some of the best events a Medeval era could have.If you'd like to buy this game and try it out, feel free to look up this server.. it'll treat ya right!Two Kings Kingdoms "

								  (Skip to bottom for review)  STORY  I found out about this game a week before it came out, and my excitement was crazy! I cringed at the price, but knew that i was not only getting this game, but getting a slot in the MMO RPG version as well: which made me feel less nervous about  the price. Finally it downloaded, and i jumped right in with a few friends.  It was hard in the beginning because we had absolutely no idea how to play. But we got along nicely. We found a very nice European server where we joined up with the locals in making a town. I was incredibly surprised to find that i had no lag though my ping was 200. Once we got the rhythem of things, we began to enjoy it alot more.   We set up a little village in a valley where it would be easy to make a living. Farms surrounded our village, mines were started on the outskirts, and the village flourished...kinda. I will point out that it is very hard to start a village, let alone maintain it. But we did!   At this moment our village still sits in that little valley, where we live in peace and hope to one day become a flourishing city...REVIEW  This game is a very ambitious one: the amount of things you can do is outstanding!  Everything from mining and crafting to cooking and farming: this game offers a spot for every person's interest.   There are bugs of course, but they are being resolved quickly, The developers have proven to me that they are dedicated, and show that through the patches that are put into the game, however small they may be.  The bugs i've noticed are more server side and game crashes than actual in-game bugs. In all honesty, the game as Early Access is coming along quite nicely.   However good the game may be, people still get turned off by the price.  So my advice to people thinking about buying the game is this: If you are interested in the game, by all means get it. But be warned that you may have some troubles along the way. But in the end you get two games out of it: Life is Feudal: Your Own edition, and the MMO RPG version when it comes out. My advice to the developers is this: Please tone down the price. 40 dollars is not something you would expect from something labelled as Early Access, however far a long the development of the game may be. I understand that you are trying to fund the MMO RPG, but more people will buy it if the price is around 20 dollars. You will still make the same profit you are now because more people will buy it.

								I've played this game quite a while now. I've played it on different skill multipliers: x50, x10, x3 and x1. I played solo and in a group.I've found that when I started playing this game is not my type of game if you play solo. On certain servers you can get all the skills on one character and do everything yourself, however, leveling up a skill on a x3 and x1 is much more satisfactory and with a 600 skill cap this makes you work together, which in my humble opinion is what this game is all about.I've been playing with a group of people for quite a while now(just came back from holiday though) and it's really enjoyable. We even switched over to roleplaying which I like even more, but you can play the game either way. However, this game is not for people who only want to fight and not do the work, to achieve something you need to work for it and put time in it.			"

												One of the best games I've played in quite a long time. I've not been able to play another game sence the offical release of the game. This game does have a while to go yet till it's ""Finished"" but in this day and age no game is ever finished upon release. You want to keep evolving and this game has shown us from Early Access to release that it has no intentions of quiting. They keep updating and adding new features. This game is a fun and safe buy. You'll have thousands of hours of game play out this game if you play solo and with a group I'd imagine you'd have much more then that. As I've said sence this games release I've played every night all night with a group of friends I've made in game and wow has it been a blast. Please support this game and it's creators. This will go a long way.			"

Early Access Review
								The Alpha of this game has been great, for the players and the company. I've played a lot of alpha's, beta's, and pre-orders. This is already become my idea of a great game. As with most gamers, in the back of our minds we all have a ""dream game that one day I'll make."" And at least for me as a strategy, simulation, and Sandbox Multiplayer type guy, this is great, and as close as anyone has come.It's very much like the game Civilization, except you are the Settlers and Worker units you sent out to start a city. You build improvements as the Worker unit in and around your city. You clear trees. You farm the land. You build city improvements (Shops, Kitchen, Warehouse, Walls, Market (Trading Post).You build Roads, often between cities, especially those within your kingdom.And combines that with a FPS, even though the models and actual combat are rather lackluster. Well, except for the armor models, the Heavy and Royal versions of all of them are pretty sweet. But eh, it's there. It will be improved.			"

												Ive played this now for 54 hours and owned it for a week if that, I looked at the mixed reviews and figured that this game was another one of those Kickstarter scams. For years I thought this until my friend played it,This game isnt the COD/Chivalry sort of game. It wont appeal to everyone and I advise to watch a few lets plays.This game is complicated in comparison to most games being released today and I love it.Would recommend this especially with the MMO coming out, hopefully it will fill that void I lost when Ultima Online went down that dark path.

												note:havent played for a couple updates.Ever since Ultima Online kind of died and was ruined post T2A, I've been waiting for someone to revive that feeling of a hardcore rpg. The execution and idea behind this game comes pretty damn close. Even the feel of it. The skill menu and inventory system is almost exactly the same. Just a bag you drag and drop your items wherever you please. The simple things like that reminded me of UO. That aside...it seems to be poorly optimized, buggy, and unfinished compared to the potential this game has to offer. It was also a bit pricey for an EA game at $40 i believe, but being I've been wanting a UO replacement, I went ahead with the purchase. There's also talk of the devs making an MMO out of the game which I'm hopeful for but have low expectations on whether it'll ever get made.With that said...If you are an old UO fan looking to rekindle that fire, I'd recommend giving this one a try			"

 Snafitzers Life is Feudal: Your Own Review -   Okay, I just started this game, but the gameplay is deep and challenging. Nowadays we stray away from challenging games, this does not. NOTE:  I will update review when I log more hours!   The challenge is there, but the community is very friendly and will help you. For example the first server I joined I said I was new in global chat and immediately someone invited me to join their village and he helped me learn the basics.   Awesome Game! Just gotta get my friends to get it now! There are very regular updates and the devs are in touch with the community. The price is justified in my opinion, and obviously many others feel the same way.  That money will go towards the game becoming better Highly Recommended, the most highly recommended  Early Access  game I have played yet.			"

								I like the game overall….BUT it takes forever to do anything. Terraforming takes a tremendous amount of time for even a small shack. . If you were able to map out/select multiple tiles to terraform and then go to it, that would make building more enjoyable. Also, gathering resources is very limited due to the amount you can carry at one time. The lack of any real in-game guidance can drive you crazy, as I had to have LIF pages open on my ipad to actually learn to play. Some in-game help, the ability to mouse hover and get some real item description, a better item placement system, actionable furniture, and easier terraforming to start. But I love to build and hope the devs continue to build and listen to $39 advisory team.			"

												First off, this game is not for everyone. It's almost like a job at times and will be grindy. Unless you have a group of friends to play with or find a group to play with in game (many groups are willing to take others in) you will be hard pressed to progress much further than a lonely hut in the forest. That being said, the number one resource in this game is dedicated manpower in the form of a player. Ive just got the game a couple weeks ago and have not been able to put it down.On actually why I recommend this game.It's hard work. I might be a glutton for punishment but I throughly enjoy games where I have to work hard for a reward or an accomplishment. To me, it makes the game that much more fulfilling. Hammering in that last log for that large 3 story house that your group has been working on for days as an example. Secondly, this game satisfies my adrenaline fix. The pvp and combat is visceral and calculated. Knowing that everything you have on you is on the line, your horse, your equipment, your armor. And yet, it is the same thing for the human on the other end of the keyboard.Current state:This version of the game is the standalone game, individual hosted servers with up to 64 players. Many of which have their own differing rule sets in regards to playstyle, raid times, skill gain, skill cap etc. An mmo version is currently in the works that has entered a beta phase open to purchasers of this game and or the mmo.

								It's a great sandbox game. It will keep you busy for hours and hours if you are into slow pace RPG/social games.Pros: Very in depth craftingDecently large mapencourages social interaction and RPVery friendly atmosphere on some server ( some more like rust on others )Very emersive...beautiful skys and landscapesSO MUCH DEPTH TO EVERYTHING ( the quality of the dirt you plant your seeds in will effect their quality ) Everything has a quality, the higher the better.Cons:Still some bugstextures dont always line up perfectly in the landscape right now leaving small gaps that you can see throughTunnels can be annoying ( you'll see )Rocks are bad mmmkay? ( you cant level rocks and they get in the wya of building ) Tunneling ^^ doesnt fix it either because you cant build where you mined.Things to think about... Do you have hours and hours to spend every night? no? then run away.. but if you do this game is so fun. Get a few friends or make a few friends to build settlements quickly. Remember how many points you get to spend is based on what the srver is set at.I have a hosted server [EST] Impulse Gaming, there is light RP on the server and we are working on building an arena for our pvp and tournaments with prizes ( in game prizes ) we have the skills cap set at max at 3,000 which is still FAR from what you would need to max everything. So plan ahead what you want to do.There are guides and wikis all over for help !!Most important!!! ********* If you do not want a skill in something open the skills page ( L ) and change the skill to either hte lock to not level or the down arrow to downgrade levels.

								STOP!  Please STOP... BEFORE you buy this game!!Please READ this CAREFULLY.... BEFORE you spend your hard earned money on this game!!I remember watching the video before this game launched on early access, and thinking it looked EPIC AS HELL.So then, the game came out, and almost every review was positive and full of great praise, and the game was a new #1 TOP SELLER on Steam!  WOW!So I  worked hard to earn some money.  I sold a bunch of toys and my old bike at my folks yard sale that weekend.  I HAD to have this game!!And then Sunday evening, I finally convinced my father to buy it for me, even though I was still about $10 short.And as I played the game, my heart full of super expectations began to break slowly but surely.  See, I had been worried before the game launched that the game might not be complete enough or be a bug-infested mess.  That's not the problem at all actually.  In fact, the game feels solid, way more complete then so many other early access survival games of it's sort....So, why was I disappointed?Well, watching the video ads for the game, and reading all the great reviews set me up to be disappointed.  This is NOT a survival game anything like Rust or DAYZ but just better because you can do more stuff and farm and make cooler houses.  I mean, I'm sure you can.  IF you have a group of friends all playing together and all agreeing not to pull your hair out in the insanely steep skill curve of the game.To give you an idea, I spend three hours in the game.  I traversed a large path through the map, looking for anything or anybody on an existing server with players.  I found not a single animal to run from, attack, fight or even just watch run off.  I saw no other players either.  But I did start trying to harvest and learn the crafting system some.  And OMG.  Let's just be honest and agree that in a game like Rust, most players don't have the patience to harvest wood, ore, and other materials themselves, and instead just try to kill other players to collect their loot.  Okay, now that we understand that, imagine a resource collecting game that is about 1/100th of the speed of collecting reosurces in Rust.  Actually 1/100th might be too fast, it might be closer to 1/500th of the speed of collecting resoruces in Rust.  I mean everything just goes soooooo slow here.  It takes 20 seconds to snap a single branch off of a tree.  Then you need to spend 20 seconds to collect some plant fiber from a plant.  Then find some rock terrain and spend another 20 seconds searching for flint.  Now you can craft maybe a primitive shovel.  Another 20 seconds, and bam!  So you're thinking cool!  That's not so bad, right?  Uhhh yeah, but now this shovel and your skill at using are crappy as hell.  So even if you set your terraforming skill to max at the character creation screen, terraforming even a small square of land is going to take HOURS.  And then you repeat the process to make an primitive axe, and you start hacking some of the smaller trees down.  More time, for every single little log.  And you move slow as hell to move that log where you want it.  And seeing as how it looks to take about 1,000 logs to even make the most basic of houses, you're talking about a time sink of hours and hours and hours and hours just to make anything even half way decent.  Compare this to a game like Rust where you can find a single woodpile, harvest it in 20 seconds, and make a complete shelter three minutes into the game.  or collect a few woodpiles and you can make a nice 4x4 2 story house in 20 or 30 minutes tops.  And remember that in Rust, 90% of the players are too lazy to even do that, and instead just look for other players to killl and rob.So sure, this game might be great when you get to the point of the videos on the store page, but after playing this game for a few hours, that it obviously so far away that it's honestly just not worth it.  I'm not going to spend 10,000 hours of grinding away in the game to get there.  And yes, I could get friends to buy the game and help me, and yay, then all of us only need to spend $40 each on the game, and spend only 2,500 hours of game time skilling up and getting to that point.  Ugh.  I hope you see my point.Before you even think about responding yelling at how bad my review is, instead go to youtube and watch some random game play videos.  And in all of them, you'll see people doing the exact same thing I did in my first few hours.  Collecting twigs, and plant fiber and looking desperately for fun, but saying something about needing to find friends and learn more about the game.  What I mean is, people are going to be boring crap.  You're not gonna see people with awesome houses and cities and advanced armor and weapons and epic fights.  No, you'll see this same super grind of skills, collecting the most basics of resources and the videos will honestly be pretty boring to watch. Now, if all of the videos now for this game are boring to watch, imagine being in their shoes playing the game and advancing at such a super crawl in the game.  Oh boy!The game is pretty solid, the graphics look plenty nice.  But honestly, I see about 98% of players being wayyyyyy too bored to continue to invest the time required to 'get to the good stuff' in this game.  I am a patient gamer, but playing this game made me want to break my arm to go play with the hackers in Rust instead.Buy it if you know what you are getting people.  This is not Rust.  The game might be deeper and better yes, but realize that you are going to be the most patient of all patient people to even get anywhere.  I mean in the upper like 1% of gamers.  For over 90% of gamers, even thouigh they might like the 'idea' of this game at first, they will soon find something with a much quicker speed of game play and advencement.  Not many people will want to spend 30 hours just searching for flint and twigs and plant fiber and then realize that OMG now they need to spend 90 more hours at the next most basic stage of character skill development.Most people complain of GRIND in mmorpg games.Magnify that grind by about 1,000 and you have 'Life is Feudal'.You've been warned.  Buy at your own risk now.  (I wish I had seen a review like mine here BEFORE I bought it) "

								Amazingly unique game that allows you to change the world around you in any way you want. Think of minecraft with nicer graphics with the skill and crafting similar to Ultima Online and the combat like Chivalry/Mount and Blade. So pretty much the best of the best!			"

								You find yourself alone on a beach, wearing nothing but your trousers and carrying a handful of cookies for survival. As you run towards the nearby forest you see four men in leather rush up a nearby road with crossbows in hand. You decide against your better judgment to follow them up a mountain. You watch from behind a tree as they stealthily get into position below a larger force of heavily armed people. The scene before you begins to unravel; There is a vast mountain fortress with high walls and an impenetrable gate. The defenders are raining arrows and bolts down on top of the besiegers who have chopped down the trees and used them to erect palisade walls for cover. The group you followed is allied with the defenders, and just as they are about to open fire the attackers spot them. Swords are drawn and chaos ensues. Two attackers and three defenders are ultimately slaughtered, one taking a crossbow bolt to the back of the head, and the rest falling to melee combat. As the leather archers retreat to their own stronghold, the battle ends as the injured and exhausted attackers make their way back to their Viking kingdom to count their spoils and nurse their wounds. A protracted, two hour long siege on a mountain fortress, all taking place within your first in-game day. You run to some corpses and find gear, running off into the woods to begin your own adventure, and avoid the bloodthirsty feuds of warring nations. This is Life, and it is Feudal. The above is an example of something which happened on the server I play on, and I am sure on many others as well. The game itself is something many people have been waiting for - a true role playing game where you take on the task of a builder, farmer, carpenter, blacksmith, miner, forester, healer, alchemist, and so on. Players must work together to survive, establishing settlements and hunting wildlife, mining deep tunnels and clear cutting entire forests. Everything you build, or grow, or cook, must be made from things gathered elsewhere, bringing a sense of true accomplishment to completed tasks, doing away with the instant gratification many games provide for us these days. Will you be a bandit? A Thane of a Viking keep? A humble farmer serving under a just and noble lord, or a wandering merchant selling his possibly ill-gotten goods to the highest bidder? The choice is yours in Life is Feudal, and for an early access Alpha game, it is arguably one of the best games to date in my opinion. Aside from the random crashing, and a few mechanics in game that one would expect to be completely possible but are not implemented yet, I would strongly recommend this game to anyone and everyone who loves medieval times and role playing games.10/10 !

								Life is Feudal is the best medieval sandbox game ever.You can build your own little hut, a big house, a giant castle, it all depends on what is your motivation level and how many friends you got.You literally start with nothing, you got to find everything on your own from trees, rock soil, grass and animals. There is a hunger system that is not too exigent, if you eat good food you'll be statisfied for a while.You can craft TONS of different types of armor/tools/weapons, deblocking the skills to craft and use them with practice and work.The learning curve is steep, you'll have to spend a few hours to understand how to do relatively complex things. Harvesting/collecting materials can be a little bit grindy at some points, especially when you want to build a huge house or big castle walls but it's a guaranteed fun time.As of now, the game is not finished, it's in early access so there's a lot more that the devs are planning to add but still, it got a lot of content for an ""unfinished"" game.You can be an archer, a knight, a crossbowmen, a bandit or claim yourself as the king of the land, it all depends on your ambitions and your skills. Depending on the server you choose, you might not be able to specialize in every crafting abilities so, if you got some friends you can always talk with them when you start and choose a ""job"" you would like to do in your clan, may it be blacksmith, tailorer, herbalist, farmer or many more, so your group can be polivalent and craft goods without having to risk trading with other factions.As of now, while i'm writing this, this game is on sale. My best advice would be to buy it on the go, before it releases into an MMO game with big servers, it's cheaper now but no one knows what the price will be when they finish developing it.With all that said, I hope to see you in-game and...Life IS Feudal!

												If you like an immersive, medieval sandbox where teamwork is required to build castles but small builds can be done alone, this may be the game for you. Life like PvP risk of death cause early players to focus on food and safety before venturing into other facets of the game like herbalism, jousting, brewing, PvP, and many other skilltrees. Dont like what you are skilled in? No problem - change your focus and build skills in other areas while reducing others. This game is my kind of fun. It is social, requires time to achieve cool things and has a fun context for RP. Most of all, the devs are accessible and progress is being made both on the Your Own server version and on the MMO which is now in beta. I struggle to find a good alternative in this genre and time period it is set in. I recommend...but be prepared to grind...That is a big part of the game. :)			"

								great fun if you have amazing patience and great teamwork. it takes forever to get things and level skills but that makes what you do that much more satisfing and valuable to your mates. teamwork is a must, this is not a single player game it is massivly cooperative and if you try to lone wolf it you can get nothing done. most skills require tools or items that you can only get from having other skills meaning you HAVE to have other people doing different work to support the group. currently this game is in alpha/beta/unfinished whatev but it will crash and dissconect frequently but if your the person who rage quits because the game crashes every so often this game isnt for you anyway. many promised features havent been added yet and im sure the mass bug reports from the sudden popularity have postponed them even further, though the features planned and already being worked on are amazing. that said since this game is in alpha and has those problems IF YOU WOULDNT DONATE THE $40 JUST TO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT DONT BUY THIS, WAIT till the mmo and then you will be blown away. the devs need time and a cash injection and everyone blowing up the servers might hamper their efforts and i soooooo want to see this game reach its full potential.

If you are a big medival fan such as myself, then you will apasalutly love this game! The complicated system really captures the meaning of survival. Wi'll some things are a bit anoying at the begining (gathering rescorces and theb uild time) you will learn to love it because its hard to get started, and also hard for others. This means that, depending on the server, there woulnt be a bunch of OP player to come and ""rek yo♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; so to speak.			"

								This game is not worth its price,I've got this game a while ago and at that point i had to say, that it had a lot of potential for an early access game. It is very time consuming but it's worth it to invest time into building your house and farming your crops and so on. The community was very nice back then and its still pretty friendly compared to other games like Rust or Day Z. Point is: It's already nearly dead. Servers are empty or low populated. The developers did not make a lot of progress in nearly a year and my prognose is: This game will never leave Alpha state. If you want to play single player, dont buy it either in this state. My local server is broken since more than 6 months and i tried to delete and reinstall it two times, only to get the same error again at server startup.Sad to say, not recommented.			"

								I am aware that this is in early access, so these points may change.However as the game is being charged for, it can still be critiqued.The progression is ridiculous, unless you're on a custom server with highly inflated progression systems, you're not going to make your first structure in your first week of playing, even then it takes too long to gather enoguh materials to do anything in a single session of play. The learning curve is more of a near vertical rock face.Until the progression system is changed drastically, I would advise against getting this game.			"

								First, i want to thank the people i met inside the game for having a nice weekend playing it. This people tried not to blame the dev's for the still early und unfinished state of a game that has a skitload of potential.The current state of the game after 4 years of development showed that choosing the right engine ""before"" creating a game is crucial for success. Torque3D is not. The development team should take care and finish the ""base"" of the game to allow a proper gameplay and maybe think about leaving this engine and make use of another more advanced plus involving the community in building it. Take ARK for one of the better examples.The game map and assets look like its an multiplayer roleplay game from the late 90's. It would not be a problem if it would not destroy the gameplay itself when you get bug-stuck with your horse on flat surfaces and can run and jump down mountains like the game plays on the moon. Random placed trees floating in the air, pretty bad controls - even Dark Souls with mouse is more playable. Some of many little and bigger things i've seen during the weekend.Community:I heard of people joining the game..and leaving again after a couple of hours, never coming back. I also heard about forum stories were devs/moderators delete comments about the current state of the game. At this state and all of the rumors, i am not sure this game was worth 20 Euros. Can i expect ongoing development or beating a dead horse for money? I really don't know, but i hope they will understand what the community has on their heart - taking care of this game that could make a lot of fun in the future.My tip:- involve community- change engine- let the community help building the game, from my experience building a strong community can help devs alot.I rate this game up, BUT its a 51/49 decision.If you expect stable gameplay or proper graphics on an Early Access game thats 4 years in development, don't buy it.

								If you like to play minecraft but think that the building and crafting is way too easy and you need a bit of a challange than you should play this game. The crafting in this game is fairly easy, it took me a couple hours to understand exactly what I was doing and how to do it. As of right now some of the features are yet to be implemented, but those that are are really cool.There is pretty much something for everyone, if you want to be a ruthless killer and slay anything that comes into your path. If you just want to harvest for your group of friends. If you like to build vast structures and terraform the landscape you can do that too. There is so much to this game that I like and hope to play for a long time.			"

												Awesome meidival game. The learning curve is not too steap (if u got some friends to play with). Since the  update the graphics are great and the bugs little. Do know u need some time on your hand to really enjoy the game to it's full potential.EDIT:I had to edit my review because this game is not getting the reviews it shouldthis game now has the status: divided. Mostly because of the following reasons. The bad reviews from when the game just got into alpha/beta, many people couldn't handle te bugs(and ofcourse i get that, but that time is besides a few small/minor bugs over).But most of all the 0.4H gamers who thought this would be a mindless/ kill whoever you want Rust/Ark kind of game. They refund the game and give a negative review after 0.4H..Besides that you got a hand full of gamers that say they only get 59 FPS with there uber gaming pc's and then instantly write a bad review ( i got a decent pc and get 60 FPS). Thats alot of reviews that have no ground and just bring the game down (while it definitly shouldn't be). Although this game is not for everyone, dont get fooled.

								so far the game is really good. but in order to get the most out of the game, you must be patient. it takes awhile to get to know the controls, how the skills work, and you must understand why you can or cannot do certain things inside of the game. take for example smelting. you must get your mining up in order to smelt your ore. you must also be able to cut billets. that also takes skill and you must have a saw. so if you are a gamer just looking to get through everything in a day, you should not play the game because you will probably give the game a bad review and we dont want this. and you must also keep in mind that this is just an early access game. do not worry about not being able to change your gender and custimizing. that will come later on. right now they just need money so that they can add and fix things that you gamers are complaining about. i also suggest using youtube to learn more about how do to play. but so far 5 out of 5 stars. great game!

								What really bugs me for being in alpha is you cant turn your head or anything??? Thats like a must and a basic of any game. Besides that, I believe this game has potential as long as it sticks to what was promised in the reviews and other information sites I read this game upon.			"

												Its what you get when you mix the combat and its depth from M&B and War Of The Roses, and splice it with the survival of Rust and Reign Of Kings.however be warned, this game is a hardcore MMO survival sandbox, most players are friendly as there are no effective lone wolves in this game, however you must be prepared to play a role in contributing to you community and to put in the hours to learn your skill lines.

								This would be so good.If only- They'd stop turning it into some kind of soggy biscuit snotfest for village people. People would populate servers- They made the game so solo players could play it without maxing options just to get anything done- Stop introducing game breaking bugs every friggin' patch- Fixed flux to be not such a grind- Fixed the map so we don't see the ocean below my feet- Put in more animals. Hell. Maxed equals 20 or so- Reduced dependencies for some skills needing the same thing done over and over (and OVER) to get SPIn other words, develop LIF:YO as a -standalone- title properly and THEN worry about the MMO.That's just the ones off the top of my head. 30 year free playing gamer here. Not some ADHD teen on Retinol.200+ hours I played. Nope, not because it's particularly charming or game worthy, that's just how long it takes to build a small house and some semi-advanced buildings before the patch ♥♥♥♥s it all up!!If you're OCD this might suit you. If you're anal retentive, this might suit you. If playing 20 hours straight to get one skill is ideal, this will suit you. If you have a life.... make sure it's not wasted on this one.6/10Average. Hold off until it gets completed.  Recommended... JUST.**Open for correction come September 2015.			"

								I am rewriting my review. I was sceptical about this game at first due to it being released to make money for their MMO, but this game is amazing. It so far hasn't had the issues of Rust and Dayz.  There isnt killing on sight due to most things you find on people are useless to you.  The skills you gain make the things usefull and things you need lots of like logs and such are too heavy to steal.  You MUST play this with others. Skill caps exist forcing people into professions with a few extra skills. Combat has a separate cap so you can be a farmer warrior without issue.  Finding other people isn't too hard and they could always use another alchemist due to their ingenious system with herbs.  Combat it difficult due to the extremely in depth combat system when you try to kill folks with stone sickles. You can get away every time against stone age tool combat. This is the most filled out early access game I have seen and is worth the 40$.			"

												I went through the reviews before getting the game, i'll be honest when i heard Sean Bean doing the intro i was sold right there and then. I thought to myself ""Dude you are getting another game you most likely will never play"" to which a voice in my head replied, ""ITS OURS, MY OWN.... MY PRECIOUS!""To put into as few words as possible, i log onto a server where for the first time in 10 years of logging onto a game i did not see someone calling another person a ""C WORD"" or any form of aggression except for somones displeasure of getting beaten down by a shovel. I met a guy from my now clan who was super awesome and explained the game to me.Im here a few days later, sitting in my office wondering what great deed i shall perform today or what marvel of engineering shall I bless this beautiful land with? Nothing.... off to tend the chickens and dig some holes but you know what? its the business and i reckon the people who write crappy reviews are the 12 year olds who cant do their multiplication tables let alone develop the patience required to play such a roboust game. I personally am glad i made the purchase and I intend on play for as long as possible.GIVE IT A TRY.			"

												First off this game is $40, after saying that i was not sure about making the purchase, but i took the chance anyway.Having said that this game is worth every penny.Pros: OPEN SANBOX COMEPLETLY, do everything , do nothing its up to you, wander around aimlessly if you want waste your money its freedom.AMAZING CRAFTING SYSTEM,Its not easy you will either have to build numerous buildings or play with friends because your going to need help. more items to craft than you can craft in 150 hrs of gameplay.Real life situations,  search  grow kill for food,you will have to terraform the land in order to build,raise animals,fight bears,This game has the most real feel of any survival game i have played,Cons: You cant really play on your own, you can but it will take you hundreds of hours to make this or that for this or that.This really is a game of cooperation, 1 person a carpenter 1 person a blacksmith and so on you can do them all but by the time you do your monitor would have burned out... seriously..This is a game best played by a group of friends, you run or rent your own server keep it private for like 20 to 30 ppl, you will all choose your jobs and be a part of the community, every piece being and overall part of the puzzle. build the town up to a city and everyone building thier own houses as well which you can build to furnish and actuall go inside to live, build 3 chairs around a fire next to a still and 3 ppl can get drunk with you in your house...you can atuclly furnish and go into every room.ill give this game a 9 out of 10 and well worth the money. as far as steams games go lately in a sea of early access crap this game shines through....  Im planning on running a dedicated server on my dual quad core and either take friends from current community or start a new one meeting new folks....OH 1 more thing, Before buying make sure your machine can run this... 40$ is  alot of money to waste if your going to get 5 fps....

												This  game? This game is special. This isn't your typical mmo where you have  to use your rotate your skills or spam to until a Mob dies, nor you can  grind for hours on end, just to achieve max level. You don't have to  worry about end game, you don't have to worry about a gear treadmill.  All you need to do is interact with other players and make the world as lively as possible.After seeing runescape turn into a wow clone in terms of combat, At first, I enjoyed it. Then I start to realize how boring the combat is. All I was  doing is going from one skill to another, just to maximize my dps. At that point, my mmo heart has turned hollow. Looking for a new mmo to fill that void. I tried countless other mmo that has the same uniqueness to runescape pre eoc. I can't. It's all the same. Every single one of them. The boring quest grinding, that even runecape didn't have that problem, The daunting gear treadmill. I just couldn't do it. Gw 2 was  pretty decent and it held me up for a while with it's more simpler combat system. The same with Eso. (Seriously, Voice acting during questing is a god send.) But this game? It has sparked my love for mmos in general  and embraced it wholeheartedly.When I first start, I didn't know what to do, or where to go. I was kinda lost honestly. So I wandered aimlessly, not knowing what to do, or how this game worked. It was so different from any other mmos out there.  Yet, I kept going, learning new things such as making tools such as an  axe to get me started. Then I met some people building a fort. They  helped me level the skills needed to build a fort and that was where the  fun really begins. Whenever I'm with people, I always have this feeling that I was a part of something. Even if they're strangers, I think of  them of my own. And when I help them with stuff like getting wood, I felt like I was contributing something big. And  that's what I realized how socially active this game made me. Don't get me wrong, I'm a very shy person, but it is rare for a game to make me come out of my shell like that. I want to continue being social, I want to hang out with other people in this game. And I can do that, because the game devs gave me the freedom to do so.I  can be whoever I want. I can be a merc who help fight a war. I can be a wanderer, going from town to town. Heck, even some sort of adventuer doing something crazy. The choice is all mine, and I love it for that.Am  I saying this is going to be this ""WOW KILLER?"" No, but it doesn't have to be. I might not played this game for over 100 hours (I don't want to be burned out. :( ) but I can tell you that if you buy this game, for whatever reason. I promise you, this trip will be like no other.  (Warning to all solo players. This game is designed to interact with other players. You can solo the game, obviously. But you'll get more enjoymeant out of playing with others.) "

												-EN-As a little experienced player I can say that, if you're someone who is willing to fight a.s.a.p. and not good with grinding, don't throw any negative comments to the game and before that, don't bother to buy it, if you're crying for a survival game like fight/fight/fight and lose your base in the next 2 hours, just go play rust. For others, add me so we can group up if you're grinding enough !-TR-Türk oyuncular için söyleyebileceğim tek şey, almayın bu oyunu siz arkadaş. Ciddi söylüyorum Rust / H1Z1 / DayZ varken bir de üstüne ""dur şu oyunu oyniyim"" demeyin. Aynı değil bu oyun onlarla, siz aynı sanıp yarım saatte 10 kişi öldürüp 5 kere ölmediğiniz için de oyuna sallıyorsunuz.

												This game...It's like The Elder Scrolls had a baby with Minecraft.Totally worth buying.Tons of crafting to do.Tons of hours to be sunk into a digital life.Don't expect to have armor your first week. This game takes a while to level up your skills. 40+ hours in and i still can't level up my bow and arrow skills, and I've been dumping major time into the game on a daily basis.Some existing bugs, but none that are game breaking.I haven't spent much time on a public server, so I can't tell you if there is a ton of KoS in this. With the limited time i DID spend in the public, people mostly were minding thier own business.The game comes with Steam tools to run your own server on your PC! But we went the pay route and have a server, since the free server is only on if that person is playing/ leaves the PC runningOverall: 8/10Loads of fun when you have a few friends to build with			"

								Hello everyone, my nickname is Atlantis and in most cases I keep that name aswell,I had my own concerns when I heard the first time of this game. ""Another Survival Game?"" I thought, but the medieval theme catched me, so I bought it a few days later trying to figure out if I could trust the developer.As a new player I was a little bit confused what to do, there is currently no tutorial or any help at all from the game itself. The current UI is working but aswell as confusing as some informations show up when you hit the right key on your keyboard, for example your skills (L), your character page (P) or simply your inventory (I). But luckily, the developer have added some helpfull entries on gamepedia.After my first steps and configurations I decided to jump straight into the multiplayer. Why? Because this game clearly is about teamplay! If you have read it by now or not, some server aswell as the planned MMO will have certain settings that will cause you to play with others to gain better weapons, a house or simply better tools. I will not go further into this as I am not writing a tutorial here ;)Currently the server performance is quiet good, although some of my mates I play with reporteed multiple crashes since the latest patch, don't forget this is an ALPHA (some like to forget such things). I enjoy the moments of gathering materials to build a building, a wall or just weapons or armor. And you will have to gather a lot! This game is extremly slow if you compare it to something like Minecraft and you don't have the chance to build your houses on your own, rather then setting up predefined houses (check the wiki for more). Combat is quiet fun but not balanced right now, slashing weapons can do decent damage, but the bleed that can be applied to you is a death sentence, aswell as some heavy crossbow that kill you nearly in a single shot. This is something that hasn't been worked on since I joined the alpha, but I believe this will be looked at.Graphic and game performance are moderate, if you have a decent pc and you have some lags, it's because of some bad server maintenance or overload of objects on a map. The sound ingame is as right now clearly nothing special. Sometimes a sound is bugging and playing in a loop until you finally decide to restart your game. Yes restart, because reconnecting/disconnecting is not implemented yet!All in all I recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of survival, teamplay, medieval and is ready to invest some time into a game and not expecting to have a big giant castle on day two.Here my personal opinion in a shorter version:+A lot of skills+A lot of crafting recipes+Teamplay needed+Patches every second week-Soundquality-Missing guild/friend system-Missing longer roadmap (I like to see a plan cause it shows some ""organization"")-Combat unbalanced-Some Crafting recipes needs to reworked-No horses :(Thanks for reading, if you liked it please give me a thumb up :D			"

								I believe this to be one of, if not The best medieval rpg sandbox game i have ever played.the beauty of this game is that everything takes time (you wont have a full scale castle in an hour)so it takes time and dedication to build up your place you can call home and even then it wont always be safe from other players. best way to play this game is to find/join a group and build a town together with everyone having there own set of tasks.

												This game has lots of great thing going for it.  The graphics are great, the crafting is intense, the combat realistic.  You can choose to be nice or not.  True sandbox.  There are no quests but the tutorial.  You get to decide what you wanna do from the moment you start the game.  The ability to host a private server is very nice as well.  The Dev team is quick to respond to bugs and put out fixes fairly quickly.  They have a known bug tracker with Mantis and keep it updated so you know where in the process which Dev is working on any particular bug.			"

								Aside from the actual server crashes and the clunky combat! I think the game would be awesome!! They need to fix a few things here and there. Finalize and OPTIMIZE a bunch of stuff. But the idea is really good. 40$ right now I don't think it is worth it, but if they come out with some good stabalization patches and optimization patches. I think it would be amazing.			"

								Haven't played in a few months. So things might have changed a bit, but I have to say i very much enjoyed the game. I'm a fairly PvP orientated guy who doesnt mind a bit of crafting and graft to get there. I love player driven games and this is certainly that. Relies on grouping together and in the MMO version, I can see it being a real success. If you like sandboxes then I say give it a go.			"

												This game is one of those games you honestly hate for what it is. You hate that it is laggy. You hate how bad the game looks sometimes. You hate that the combat is janky. You hate all the occasional glitches and bugs. You hate how horrible it deals with some of the systems and character leveling. You hate how nearly every server is atrocious and has Game Masters who have no clue what they are doing. You hate so much of the game, but you also find it enjoyable for what it allows you to do. You find it to be pretty damn good with the right people. This game provides you a means to have great roleplay with great players; and some not to great players to where it can hurt, but we won't go more into that. This game allows for you to build a settlment of two or three people and live as farmers would. It gives you the chance to be a knight or a mercenary. You can strive to be a king as you fight agaisnt other players who have the same aspiration. This game can be really good, but only if everything goes right for what you want. If you want to grief people and be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, there are servers that allow it. If you want to have huge battles, framerate permitting, there are servers for it. If that's your thing, go for it. If you want to roleplay and have pretty good medievale life simulator, there are good servers. You will have to look a lot and deal with some bad servers, but you will find good ones. One more thing, this game is meant to be played with friends. The only reason I put up with this game for so long, was great people and friends I made and brought along the way. You will probably never enjoy this game without friends and good players to play with. Thus I don't recommend this game, unless you have good friends to play with. Also, do not buy this game for $40. Buy it on sale or in a bundle for like $20 at the most. This game is for a very small percentage of gamers who are patient, are fine with the grinding, can deal with griefing every now and then, are very creative, love to roleplay, and enjoy this game enough to barely stop themselves from throwing their computer at a wall. If that isn't you, back away slowly and never come back.			"

								This game is designed similar to the MMO Würm.To those that don't already know what Würm is, it is a ultra realistic medieval simulator with tons of grinding and real life day efforts to accomplish greater deeds, Minecraft copied Würm and made it into a piece of cake for newbies ( Arcade )And today we have this game which is way more fast paced than Würm but also harder than Minecraft.The concept so far is great and I expect lots of features/content to be added through the development periode of the next few months.Pros:-Great Medieval Simulation.-Architectur / Terraforming is vital to be planned out ahead. ( No instant Minecraft houses )-Cooperative play is highly recommended as resources is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to collect on your own.-Bandits/PVP players gets punished by lossing more stats on death.-Great RPG elements shown through a very neat list of skill trees which unlocks upgrades along the paths you choose.Cons:-Animals are almost impossible to kill since a moose can take like 150 hits with a stone axe to kill and a wolf will straight up pwn you as you will not be propper quipped for combat until late game.-Server crashing and slow server list made the game very frustrating, however a few days ago they patched some of bugs which have caused a relative stable version. ( I haven't crashed in awhile now )-Combat got an animation but compared how they wanted to make it like Mount and Blade hit detection, it is just a prototype as of now and it is more like throwing a dice with a very low chance of hitting.Conclusion:Overall I would say this is a good investment, it shows lots of potential in its current shape and for medieval enthusiaststhat wants to experience a simulation of medieval life, this is the game there is so many skill trees to make you anything from a architect to a pope.I really recommend this game since it got patched against server crashing which allows you to play a sort of demo with limited animations but the gameplay is fluid :)Hope you enjoyed my review, get in the game with some friends and start building!

												This game is complex, and it is not intuitive and depending on the server you play on can be very slow to do anything.At its core though it is what it says it is though, and boasts some great features buried deep within its context menus.In some ways, I am growing to like this as it does serve as a filter that caters towards a certain type of player.Like any game.. it has its fair share of bugs.. maybe more then others, maybe less, but it is being actively worked on and the developers are fixing bugs at a seemingly steady pace and most importantly are engaging with the community to do so.Talking about gameplay,This game is not fast paced, though can be depending on server settings etc.This game is not really good as a solo player, you need to be in a group or join a settlement to really enjoy it and to progress quickly and get the most out of the emergent gameplay that occurs 'in my opinion'.This being said, being a solo player is still viable, but you will not progress as quickly as a group of people(provided they are coordinated).When you talk about combat, having a couple friends is always better then having to fight and fend of an attack alone so as a solo player making allies would be important.If you are looking for a PvP orientated survival game that is complex, has RPG elements, takes time to play and learn, has a detailed crafting system and makes you look up a wiki just to chop a tree down this could be the game for you.This game demands time and patience,I recommend this game as graphically it is nice, gameplay it is ok once you get used to it, but I would not encourage people to rush out and buy it.This game caters to a niche type of player, do the standard research and be sure you are willing to put in the time, and have patience to learn and play this game.

												The release went a little rough, but in the end they've done everything promised and then some. The release day bugs that plague many folks were cleared up just a mere few days after. The game is a great survival sandbox that REQUIRES cooperation, time, and patience. The grind is hard and long but when you finally finish a long project, its well worth all of your hard work. This isn't your typical survival game. This isn't like rust or dayz but falls more in line with Wurm than anything. Crafting, leveling up, and building are intense actions that can be overwhelming if you're not expecting it. So be prepared, Life is Feudal			"

								Right off the bat, the game is challanging. You start with nothing but the rags on your back and the cookies in your hand. There's nothing like a good challange, right? If you think surviving is all there is, you're wrong. Terraform entire landscapes. Mine massive underground caverns with your own two hands. Build, defend, and besiege empires. go from hand made, to industrial enterprise with a number of handy buildings. Despite being very early alpha, and having numerous bugs, the creators work endlessly to keep on top of them all.+Serf Simulator+Medieval+Sandbox+Creativity+Open Envornment+Cookies (Use Sparingly)			"

												Warning: more addictive than minecraft.This is not a single player game, if you're trying to play it as such, you're going to have issues, as it is a lot of work to get anything done, and a variety of players with a variety of skills makes everything go a lot smoother.But if you enjoy those games where you spend a lot of time doing the same sort of things over and over again for an end result, this one is for you. It's got a lot you can do in it, from terraforming, construction on that now flat ground, farming, hunting etc. and most of it seems to work fairly well. It is a bit of a learning curve, but after a few hours it does become fairly intuitive, you right click, you discover what you can do, you do it a bit more, you can do more things. I certainly reccommend this game, although do stress again, not a single player experience.			"

												Okay so this is my first review ever, so keep that in mind.Also keep in mind, THIS GAME IS NOT FINISHED YET!!   A lot of people may trash one thing or another without realizing that this is not a complete product.  For an unfinished game, it's fantastic.  For a published game, it's got some work.  Things to expect: Bugs bugs and more bugs.  Again, this is not a complete product.  So yes, there's bugs.  There's quite a few annoying ones.  HOWEVER since I have purchased this game a lot has been done to fix these bugs and to improve on the game.  If you like simulation type games/RPG based on crafting.  You'll love this game.  Very few games come close.   I would argue some of the skills don't make sense when it comes to unlocking certain skills..  Like Tailoring is unlocked through..  Cooking?  ..  wha..??  Procuration is also a requirement as well as farming..   ?!?!?!    I think that needs to be re-evaluated.  However, the way the skills work in terms of leveling them up is great.  There's basically a few ""Teirs"" to skills.   0-29, I would call this untrained.  You don't know completely what you're doing, you can't do very much with it, and whta you can do will result in terrible products.   30-59.  I would call this an apprentice.  you know some stuff and you can do some useful stuff, things you make or produce with this skill is not great but you're learning.  60-89, journeyman.  You can pretty much do what you need wit hthe skill and have descent items created from it.  it doesn't take too long to get to 60 in most skills.  Once you're there, you don't really NEEEEED to go any further unless you want to specialize in that skill.  Keep in mind you have a limited amount of skill points so you can't do everything in the game (unless you're on one of those servers who pretty much get rid of the skillcaps)  Getting to 90, which I would say is master, 100 being grandmaster, takes time.  so, skills are cool, the unlocking part needs work.Combat is gross right now.   plain and simple.   The idea behind it though is amazing.  If you get wounded, doesn't matter if a healer can heal you, tha'tll just keep you alive, you're done.  Unless your suicidal.  This makes for a fantastic combat system where player skill mixed with character skill could land a blow that takes someone out of the fight.  Killing also shouldn't be taken lightly as you will loose karma/alignment.  the lower alignment you have, the more skills you loose when you die.  ALSO if your alignment drops enough, anyone can kill you WITHOUT penalty.  So careful.  People do have the opporunity to yeild.  I would highly suggest letting them live.   Again, cool ideas with the combat system, can't wait till the kinks are worked out.Crafting and combat.   That's this game in a nutshell.  Some people RP which is cool.  Either way, if that's someting you like, this game, once it's complete should fill that need quite nicely.  For me it already does.  I am quite patient with bugs however, and some people are not.  I reccoment this game to those who aren't always looking for action and like to craft and build.			"

								I honestly think, this game ... it's not really a game, its more a tough simulator, a real insight to the intense labour needed in these middle ages, and yet although progress can be slow, it is one of the greatest games i have played.

												I will not play this game right now.. BUT I give it a thumbs up! Let me explain...It's a great game; hours of entertainment, good mechanics, good graphics, and its really fun! Unfortunately every time I get the urge to play I am immediately turned off by one thing... flux... It's a small issue I suppose but the requirement to grind HERBS for flux to make steel if you're like me and don't have the means to play with lots of other people in collaboration means that once you out enough hours into the game and you start needing a lot of steel for everything you end up spending weeks just clicking on herbs trying to grind enough randomly dropped ingredients for flux.. It's not immersive to me and if this issue was fixed I would be on this game CONSTANTLY!Again this is my own personal opinion and if you have the means to play with lots of people and can collaborate as many do then this likely won't be an issue for you!

Reminds me of a modern day Ultima Online with the freedom and choice to gain skill in the many different talents.Game is now done. Full release and is just as magnificent plus much more!If you like open world games, building bases, PvP, Murder, Killing, Pillaging, HUGE scale battles (based on server pop) and just an all around fun game to blow hours of your life away into. Then this is the game to get.Game has been fun and can be played for DAYS before you're aware you've been in the game for an hour.Get the game. Find some friends. Have a good time doing your part in your own village, town, city. By producing crafts, buildings, and food to advance your guild. Then gear up and protect your claim of land against rival guilds or the lone wandering barbarians and murderous.What will you do to become the greatest kingdom of the land?			"

								I would like to make the note that this is still early developmentThis game is so far very interesting, it's concepts and ideas are really good, and they have a great base to work with. It's price is a little steep and there are some improvements that I am sure they will work on and fix, but as I said before it's early development and if you feel it's not worth the price right now, I can say it's most surely something you will want to watch grow.So far the game mostly offers a MP (Multiplayer) base, there is single player with just yourself or your friends (no idea how that really works yet) So if you're like me who loves these types of games but has trouble with a multiplayer asepct thats something to keep an eye or two on. I would love to see them add NPCs and focus on Singleplayer for in my eyes I think that would be a huge leap into a good direction.So like all games there are pros and cons, but this is most surely a game I enjoy, and if you don't want to buy it, I encourage you to watch and keep it on a wishlist.

												If you're anything like me you'll love this game.I've desperately been searching for a community based town building game. This game has that with pvp aspects added in. It definitely has a long way to go but if you find a good server you can still get a very enjoyable experience even though everything is not fully implemented yet. The future for this game is very bright and even if you don't buy it to support it's development I would keep your eye on this game for when it hits MMO phase.Pros: The variety of servers available really lets you choose your own play-style. If you want to go alone and keep it easy you can choose a server with high skill multiplier (you level up faster) and a higher skill cap (so you can do more things). While if you're looking for a challenge you can join a server with lower limits and slower leveling (such as Camelot). For me, I enjoy the challenge and I feel rewarded when I finally finish building that project I've been working on, or that I finally reached that level I've been training for. EVEN if this game was to stop being developed today I know that with the modding community the way it is, and the guys over at Camelot server, this game could still be enjoyable indefinitely. Being a part of community and being needed for your skills by that community is an amazing feeling and really promotes the social aspect of this game. Cons: Unless skills are set to over 1500 max you'll need at least a few other people to play and build a community with. Some servers are poorly managed and it may be hard to find one that really suites your play style that is consistently up. The game is still lacking in may aspects, but it's in alpha and you are supporting development by buying the game like it is. If you're into playing solo or a lot of heavy action packed game-play you may not like this. If you don't like medieval settings or non-targeted combat (like chivalry or mount and blade) you may not like this game.My Alpha review is 10/10See you in game!			"

												First of all, WHY THE **** MIXED REVIEWS?!   This is an awesome game, it runs really fast with maximum settings on my pc -- my pc is a normal pc not even a gamer's. This game includes an ininite amount of hours of variated and fun content, and it looks awesome. It's awesome, like minecraft hugely realistic and with epic^1000 graphics. When crafting each type of item it's like a puzzle itself, in an awesome way. When you finish a building you really feel proud of yourself, like if you had built it in real life.  The 'grinding' it has, it's pretty fast and you end up with awesome results. Spent 2 days and built a huge stone wall, all by myself -- Finding stones, Choping trees, getting wooden boards out of them, digging clay. Even though you might think it takes long to built only a stone wall, it really feels like didn't, because you don't built the entire wall at once. You build each section at a time and rapidly feel the awesome results of it. And not only that, there are about 30 different types of 'Wall Sections' of each tier. (Wood, Stone, Castle) Some of those are: Wall, Diagonal wall, tower, diagonal tower, gatehouse, wall with stairs... This game is awesome ! It is hugely immersive and detailed. It is slow-paced but it feels like if it was fast-paced after playing a little. I hugely recommend this game, for people who like RPGs. ""To play this game really feels like being in the medieval era"" 9/10Awesome graphics, fun, interesting, entertaining. And pretty hard.Has some minor bugs, but it's an excelent game.

								review updated on 11/12/2014Where to start.lets start with crafting.it is long and tedious and the amount of time you need to put into it is amazing. it takes a long time to make everything work. to get to that first shack, to your first weapon, to your first house and beyond.This is not your normal crafting game. this is much more. I would liken it to Rust ( since i have played it ) but much much better. like 100 times better.if you drop something there is a timer before anyone can pick it up.when you die  you have something like 2 hours to pick it up. no one else can touch it until then.104.4 hours into the game and i'm just now getting the basic  workshop buildings up and i have a very long ways to go before i can make anything resembling a city. This is definitely the first Online game that i enjoy. considering how much i dislike these types of games, this one gets past my dislike because of how it works, the negatives other players get if they attack you.they can't just rip you off. well they can if you have a undefended village, but thats normal.Now this game is very much in alpha stage of development as of this review. personally for me. i think the current cost of $39.99 is worth it.But for a online game, i like it. very much.9/10 rating from me.Its alpha, don't buy it unless you wish to support the games development!!!!update 11/12/2014Keeping my review at recomend.Some new info after my time playing, since i wrote the review i had 100 hours into the game, and now about 430. took my time learning more about the game.So let's go and see what i have found out.1. The game has bugs, but thats expected. most are of the annoying type and don't really cause any major issues in the game.2. Game lag. this is mostly due to the trees and it not being optimized. if you keep setting down like draw distance on trees the lag is manageable. plus the lag spikes but sometimes they are as manageable and sometimes not. again, somthing thats expected in a game this early in development.3. Servers i have played on a few private servers and had a blast. until they dropped with no warning. which sucks, lost all my and my teams hard work. I'm not normally a online player that gets onto servers so i don't know if thats normal or not.4. Updates. there has been a couple since i got the game, last one added ability to put furniture where i wanted it. like in the house i built. so that's a plus. and sounds like more animals will be in the next one. so thats another plus.5. Combat. crossbows suck. the range is ridiculously short and they come before bows. the simplest weapon, the bow should be first., after the sling that is.5.1 Combat, Swords. now this can be fun, though with the tree lag it can be problematic at times. but once you figure it out it works rather well. take s a bit of time to find that sweet spot. took me many wolves and mooses before i figured that one out.5.2 Combat Animals. The wolf, it brings a new fear as you run half naked across the sands or in the forests. you learn why humans feared this animal for eons and tried to eradicate it off the face of the planet. freaking things are deadly. until you get some good armour.. then they more of a nuisance. but if you goof, they can still be deadly. as i found out while wearing plate mail armour. wolf hit me in the head and knocked me silly, he then proceeded to chew my intestines like they was spaghetti.6. Herbalism, the 50,000,000 million combinations thats possible. now this is crucial because you need flux to build the advanced buildings and structures. and flux.. if you're doing it on your own or with just a couple people. can be tedious to get ahold of and time consuming. but the more people you get, the easier it becomes. and if you have other camps willing to trade. then it becomes super easy.6. Plant Fiber and coops and making of snares. this one i don't much care for in its current state. plant fiber is very time consuming to get. because you only get 1 from each swipe. even with a team of people working with you, its still a chore. especially since if you want to stock your coops to get dung. well you need a ton of snares, and making snares requires a massive, huge load of plant fiber. i think thats the one major issue i have with this game. that and that coops don't really work yet. and the amount of dung you get off it.. is tiny, and tiny dont work if you have a huge farm that requires it.there is still a fair amount of content not added yet as of this updated review. but i still endorse this game. and i can see it just getting better and better.and a reminder.this is a game in development, it has bugs and issues and on some peoples computer. it either won't run or lag so badly you can't really play it. Read the system requirements before buying!! if you're close to the min specs. your not gonna have a 60fps, more like 15fps or 5fps.until more content is added that is all for now with this updated review.

								310 Hours played, a dozen or so servers.  PVP, PVE, Raiding, etc.- $40 is very expensive for a early access game.- Definitely got $40 worth of fun out of LiF- Right now the amount of fun you will have is heavily dependent on the server you are on.- There are servers with  house-rules and servers without rules.  - The skill progression of the game is completely different for each server as well as several very important factors, all tweaked by that specific server's admin to test those settings.- You need to find a server that will play at the speed you want to play, with the amount of people you want to play with, with the rules want to abide by.- The PVP is not broken although you will find swinging with a wooden shovel is not very effective when compared to a claymore and the hitboxes are a little iffy.- There are currently some serious bottlenecks with how much you can do to a server before it starts to get bogged down.  Cutting down trees and leaving stumps, excessive mining and building are no nos- Remember this game is an Alpha, and as much as you want daily updates with groundbreaking new material you are basically signing up for a testing job- All this being said, actually creating stone walls, metal tools, suits of armor, etc from nothing but what you find and build is incredibly satisfying.  To go from a naked guy with a handfull of cookies to the proud owner of ""The Vault"", a walled in farm, and the highest quality producing iron mine on the server (all while being constantly harassed by raiders) provides a sense of achievment i've not found in many other games.- Soloing this game is tough but i find just one or two other people is all you need on any server with a skill cap of 1000 or above.  Large groups are very fun to play with but some people are picky about which job they want to do.- I wont be like the rest of the reviewers and pretend to know whats going on behind the scenes with the devs but as far as my experience goes they have been great, Bobik personall replied to a question i had.  LiF sees an update every week or two.I heavily reccomend this game, but at the price its at its tough to say go and buy it.  If you are into games with steep learning curves, coop gameplay, building/mining games, sword slashing, or just plain living Feudal, go for it!8/10 "

								This game is very, very slow paced, and it does take time to do things. the game itself (for being in alpha) is great. if you have some time on your hands, then this game is for you, but if you like things being handed to you on a silver platter, like Minecraft, then you should not play this game. the game takes time to get used to, and it is really benefitting in the end. I rate this game 9/10 because the time it takes to do things should be deducted just a little bit.			"

Early Access Review
								Allow me to say this first.The game is in early access, and is by all means flawed. There are bugs. There are things you will dislike. There are parts you mind find amazing, but sadly not yet implemented. All of this is present.But besides that, I do honestly believe that if you have ever shown a liking towards the idea of being a medieval peasant, who can maybe work himself out to be a capable warrior, skilled farmer or perhaps a prized alchemist, this might rock your boat.Let us first summarize the pros. The game presents and open world with other players, but you must not worry about getting stabbed with a nearest stick as soon as you find another human being. Not only is this forbidden on most server, it also has negative consequences. As I mentioned above, there are several profession you can do, and freely combine if you for example want to do basic farming as well as basic smithing, though such merging will prevent you from being a master in either. The game requires you to play in groups of multiple people, which could be considered a downside, but I like this feature, since it can create a friendlier atmoshphere, forge possible friendships and makes it feel much more like a medieval town that you work towards. The various professions have quite a bit of depth in them and all are equally important to the community. Very importantly, I find the developers to be fairly active and helpful, despite some fearing an unknown studio will fail. The updates are surprisingly common and you can also track what they are up to from a number of videos on their channel.Now about the bad. It might be very easy for someone to find the game repetitive, as you are often required to amass a certain amount of resources before you can focus on something perhaps a bit more desirable. To add to the injury, you will see a lot of progress bars, which might be fast, but are frequent. The game is not the most optimized in the world, though it went up a lot lately, and is surprisingly stable. The combat system leaves a lot to be desired, mainly in precision. This will hopefully (and likely) be changed in a later update, yet as of now, it must be mentioned.The recollection.The game has an incredible atmosphere, bringing you to the harsh world of feudal times. If you ever wanted to be a medieval smith, hunter, farmer, alchemist or perhaps a builder, you will find this game quite pleasing. The long time it takes to complete various tasks such as building houses or creating complex tools can be infuriating, but if you manage to find a friendly group of people with whom to work on a village and get to speak with them on, say, teamspeak (which is very common, no worries), a lot of this boredom will dissipate, thanks in no small part thank to having people to talk with as you do your things. With all that, the game deserves your attention and perhaps further investigation.And that is my recommendation.			"

												This is a game with lots of potential as well as already being a pretty good game already. The developers are quite active in the forums and are good at fixing bugs quickly. The game had a bad release with lots of bugs, but they've fixed a lot of them in the first few days, with more patches to come, which helps to show their dedication to the game. The one MAJOR thing is to make sure you have a computer able to meet the system requirements, which are quite high, as this is the one game out of the almost 90 or so that i own that i cant play on my computer, due to the high requirements for the graphics card. I would personally wait for a week or two before buying, so that they can hopefully get all the bugs worked out. The game is not for people who aren't willing to spend the first 5-6 hours just getting the very basic tools and starting resource gathering. It is a game designed for co-op, which makes single player virtually impossible due to the huge amount of time needed to do anything. I would recomend checking on the forums to find a group to join if you dont have a few friends to play the game with, as there are lots of great guilds out there to play with.			"

								Don't really know why there are so many negative comments. The game does what it states to do. When I purchased I knew it was a testing platform for the MMO. There have been reasonably regular updates. I run a server and it is now extremely stable. The game, whilst not fully implemented, has enormous potential for an MMO as it has a depth to it that you don't often see in games. If you haven't played it for a while I would suggest giving it another go now that there have been some significant fixes. I guess it is an ALPHA and the problem is now that with the plethora of Early Access games on Steam people seem to forget what an ALPHA is. An ALPHA is not a Beta or the finished product!			"

Things to come: Horses, Siege weapons, claim system and much more I probably missed some cause im excited! Graphics are amazing. There are still some bugs as it still is an Alpha game.

								This is early acces, don't buy if you are not ready for some problems.But LiF is realy good game.Why?Because of many reasons. I will tell you about them later, now it's time to say why you must NOT buy it.1. If you dont't like to cooperate with people to reach the hight goal.2. If want to get fully functional game. (Just wait a few months, boys and girls).3. If you cant stand medieval.In a case those 3 points aren't mettter for you - buy this game. Yeah, its not yet perfect - but its playeble, just find a party and build up your own kingdom. You can be mighty warrior and master alchemist, lazy bowcrafter or talented blacksmith, fisherman or hunter. But you can't be superman (without GM tools). So to get smth good you need a friends to co-op or just other players to trade.Developers still working to improve engine, but after we will get huge amount of content.But its my opinion.To be sure that you need this game - try to watch some streams and gameplay videos.9/10UPD After half year I wanna say that game is truly cool. Every few weeks new updates and patches. Hotfixes are always delivered as fast as possible. Developers are realy taking care about their game. For sure some bugs exist, but game is still in early acces, so its allright. Amount of in-game stuff is totaly amazing.			"

								someone went on a rant about this game - here is what I wrote in reply but was limited to 1000 chr.  - there is a review in here as well.  Running to work and don't have the time to tweak this - so here is raw.erh - don't support the game? so the patches are what? (the patch record sort of destroys your ‘argument’ about that) as for the game itself I have paid for 'finished' games that suck way more than this. That said I see a trend with companies releasing Alphas until ??? and using that as an excuse for never ending worthless game.  I do see improvements in this game on concerns I had and I do not get the vibe of being strung along.  Back to your rant about this game - I personally go by game play / enjoyment to dollar ratio.  $40 is high for an alpha but yet I feel I am well on my way to get my bang for a buck in game play.  The game has is quirks but again I have play 'blockbuster' finished games that suck way more and have given me less dollar value.   Those reading this on the fence - please don't let the review above stop you from considering this game.  Know this about this game – it is a GRIND… “you want to do this, well to do that, you need to do this first, then that, then that other thing and finally you get to do ??? wait what was it I was trying to do?” – that is this game in a nut shell, if you have OCD this game will be suck you in and you LOVE it and hate it as the hours peel away… if you are looking for a quick gaming fix erh, you won’t last 1 hour.  As for this ‘paying for this supports the MMO” erh – yeah – they made that clear to me… and take any franchise and guess what… do you think more $$$ went into make the last COD better or advertising for the ‘new’ COD – where did that $$$ come from – from you buying the now unsupported older versions.

								This is an alpha with great potential, It's not perfect but it is alpha. It is being updated and if you buy it, you get to use one of your characters in the MMO when it's out. I don't understand all the bad reviews. If you are into crafting, building, farming etc. it's great. It has a very deep crafting system. Working in a group gets things done much faster, in fact you pretty much need more than one person to get stuff done but its not a village if theres just one person :).The game has its problems but that's to be expected at this stage, IMO what they have achieved so far is great and i can't wait to see what comes next.From the early access notice: ""NO, we WILL NOT abandon this project! Actually this project will evolve into a full scale Sandbox MMORPG of which we are already running pre-alpha testing at this time.”			"

												Game takes too long to to anything. Build a tiny shack? Well that'll take 2 hours minimum. I needed to make a bow to hunt animals, so I need to level up my crossbow mastery first (??), but to make a crossbow I need a linen rope, then to make a linen rope I need to have my Procuration leveled up to 30... Which is leveled by hunting animals. So I hunt animals with a sling for several hours to make glue out of their bones. So after several hours of painful, glitchy and frustating hunting, I have my procuration up to the MINIMUM needed to make a linen rope.Well now I need to build a spinning wheel.... which takes a wheel and nails.... which I need smelting and carpentry for. So after about 12 hours I can't even make a simple bow, the weakest bow of them all.I currently own a tiny shack, a camp fire, two furnaces and a kiln.Keeping in mind this is with one of my friends playing while I'm not on and he's contributing to our little camp.For now, don't recommend. The game is tedious, confusing and will definitely require the wiki which doesn't explain a lot at times.I'm all for hard games, but this isn't hard. It's just repetitive, confusing nonsense. Luckily I play on a PvE server or else I'm sure I would've rage quit hours ago do to raiding on my little base.Will update as progress is made towards the game.*Update*My friend and I have since stopped playing all together. We finished with a decent sized camp. Played on a low pop server so we only ran into a couple people and never had any issues.It just wasn't for us. Between lives and work, there wasn't enough time to justify to get on for maybe 3 hours and maybe by then we could've finished a couple items. If there was a server where everything was speed up 5x, then it would've been a lot better. I always have an issue with a game where you have to wait 24 real hours for wheat to grow.			"

								GRIND is the word of the day here. This game is very deep and with more features to come will no doubt get more so. If you've played Wurm Online and enjoyed it, then no doubt that is the closest descriptor I can find for you. Very easy to lose hours working on your stats to be able to build a house. If you're interested in online play, then take the time to ask when you join a server to make sure it's a good fit for you. Some servers are looking to build and work on stats, others are looking at survival PvP. The only annoyances I have found so far are in the controls and the learning curve, although I love discovery myself and don't like long tutorials. IT would be great if there was a little more help in theway of game controls, hud, and how XP tree works. beyond that, the wiki is still growing and has been a huge asset.			"

								Considering this is an Alpha stage game, it is suprisingly addicting. Despite the bugs and fairly frequent crashes, I can't seem to get enough. I bought this game expecting to play a bit to see where they were in development and really play when it was finished, but once I started... 130+ hours in about 4 days and a few groggy days at work later, I'm still hooked. Think 'The Sims', 'Skyrim', and 'Minecraft' rolled into one game.. As stated before, it's not finished, there's still alot of features disabled and many of the ones that aren't are buggy or obvious placeholders.  But the idea and style of the game are sound, and it is entertaining. My biggest complaint so far is the server selection screen.  It is too basic. It needs filters and the option to save or identify servers you've been on. Overall, it's very promising.  I look forward to when it's finished.			"

												This game was very GOOD. I thouroughly enjpoyed the mix of crafting and survival elements involved in the intrensic design of the game. the visuals are very retro, the squares and triangles are very artistic. The game is designed to make you think about the real world because the controls have to be figured out by trial and error. Just to keep the game interesting, it will remove your ability to lok around, for the purpose of iintuitive gameplay. SPOILERS, the boars in this game are the ultamate end game bgoss, they dont need to follo0w game rules, will walk through anything, and kill you, also they cannot die. I find this to be a play and exploration of our capitalist society and the way we socialy condition -peoiple to follow authority. I got this game for $10 and i actually feel guilty i didnt pay the full $30. Great game, please buy.			"

												Hello, I, Ferrell also know as Kintok, personally invite you to bring a group and experience the full dive of the Brotherhood of the Wolf server in Life is Fuedal: Your Own. We are full Rp and Full PvP with upcoming PvP events, and gaming grounds for training. We are Noob Friendly with a staff on standby for teaching basics. We also offer a live map with a minute and a half refresh for claim and player positions. We also have a active GM. All structures are built with labour nothing is, or will be, spawned by the GM. We support experierencing every aspect of the game, including the hard labor. The Capital is located on the northeast pennisula if you have questions or want to send a dignitary from your group. We also have new hardware coming to update the server, without wipe, so our server will run alot smoother. We offer a Live Map feed to show player and claim positions with a refresh of a minute and a half. The live map is a separate web page that can be accessed from a cell phone, for the full screen players. The Live Map can also be controlled by the Admin, like taking out the player nodes for PvP. The server is also privately owned offering better service. We have a Teamspeak server with multiple channels for different claims (you can get the information by asking in the global chat on server). Any questions don't be afraid to message me. Looking forward to seeing new faces! Live Map Feed: http://livemap.soa-modding.com/ "

								TL;DR: You will put many hours into this game before you see any significant progress. The game does not instantly reward you. You will spend lots of time on the wiki and in forums getting answers to your questions. If you plan to play alone, you're choosing to make the experience much harder on yourself. To get full enjoyment of the game, join a village. If you're looking for a relaxing game with a deep crafting system, the ability to create any conceivable design for a village (within the limits of the game mechanics of course), a challenging yet rewarding gaming experience, then this game might be for you. I'd like to first address the reasons I believe people would not enjoy this game. 1. You will not be instantly rewarded for your labors. It takes time to erect a clay hut, to construct a house, to build a wall. If you've played Rust, you're more familiar with the ability to simply gather a certain number of wood and clicking the structure you wish to build. In LiF, it's much more tedious.  The gathering process beforehand along with acquiring the skills necessary to even gather those materials are a discipline in and of itself. Once you do achieve the appropriate levels and gather all materials, you can finally build your structure, that is if it's on level ground. If the ground is not level, you must terraform. If you're not familiar with terraforming, this game is a perfect introduction. All it means is diggins out dirt and leveling out the terrain. 2. Lack of NPCs. This, in my opinion, adds an interesting dynamic to the game. It forces players to cooperate in ways they may not have before or have always refused doing. However, the amount of time and effort it takes to gather certain ingredients makes it almost advisable to establish some form of trade contract with another player to help with your experience. 3. Weak PVP system? Long story short, killing other players can be an immense challenge considering their abilities. For example, you can always run into a village in full armor and a two-handed sword and murder a player who's unarmed, and lacks armor with ease. Of course, this is assuming you have the appropriate levels to even wear armor which you have to craft and you can only craft that armor if you have the appropriate gathering levels to get those ingredients. This is why cooperation is stressed in LiF because you can have different players have various roles (blacksmith, carpenter, herbalist, etc) and you come together to build a flourishing experience. Anyway, I digress. Assuming both players are in a consenting battle, it won't be shortly won as the targeting system is physics based meaning wherever you swing is where you'll do damage. Since the game is in Alpha it's not always accurate. Of course you can move around and block and there are even crossbows to attack at range. And the game does not reward you for killing others. In fact, in a way it punishes you. You have a prayer skill which is measured by something called Alignment. Everytime you do damage to another player your alignment decreases. This means, if you die with low alignment, you will lose skill points and the lower your alignment the more points you lose. However, you do have the ability to invite a player into a ""unit"" which makes it so alignment is not lost during combat. You can begin to see how random death matches actually hinder the assailant and simply inconveniences the victim.  4. Bugs. If you purchase the game in this current state, you will notice bugs here and there. They do not significantly impact your experience nor does it take away from the game. All the necessary components are in the game and you will be able to play it just fine. 5. Intense graphics requirements. Many players including myself have to lower the graphics settings to lowest to avoid sluggish gameplay. But I have to say even with graphics set to lowest the game still looks great. If you can get past these points and are still interested in playing the game, I just barely scratched the surface. I recommend giving this game a chance to lure you into its creative depths and challenge yourself with a very intricate game. You may not be instantly rewarded, but the rewards you do receive are damn good.			"

								This game have a lot of potential when it's done. My best comparison would be mount & blade mixed with Mortal online/Ultima online with the open world and skills elements. You can also build wherever you want and attack people with a pitchfork, yes a pitchfork. If you decide to buy and support the developement of Life is Feudal be aware of that it's an early access and there's going to be crashes, bugs and unoptimized gaming. Although with all of that early access stuffiduffs it's pretty darn fun when you band together with others.			"

												If you want a medieval survivalgame to play with a group of friends its awesome!If you want MMO, battles vs other clans and so on im not sure its quite there yet, might get there one day but at the moment i realy enjoy the building and survival aspect of the game.The skill system is fun and it makes you want to team up with a group of friend where everyone specialises in a certain area to be a efficient group!

								This game opens the portal to a new realm in a distant time and place, where life is hard and simple, yet vastly rewarding if you allow it. Your place in this world is what you make of it. It is not a world of instant gratification; proper time investment, focus strategy, and cooperation will be rewarded.Most true-to-life game ever. Can you handle it?			"

								ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT! Unbelievable how solid this game is now... and for such an incredible lofty vision, the devs have really nailed it for the most part. This one totally changed my view of Early Access games for the good. LIKES: graphics are actually quite nice, stable game play (no crashes in 30 hrs yet), breadth and scope of crafting, warfare, building, leveling up, etc (very robust features), the fact that you can't really play on your own - promotes team work and cooperative playDISLIKES: long long long long long long long long long load times. I clocked between 14-18 minutes to get INTO the game.Totally recommend this to players who like medieval themes, sandbox games, intricate and detailed skill levelling systems, laborious yet rewarding development of characters and their skill lines, have friends that like to co-op			"

												Hands down the best crafting game I have ever played. The main reason I chose this game over other crafting games, like Rust, is because this game has no GUNS. In my opinion, guns ruin most crafting games because that is pretty much what the game becomes about, finding guns.Lets play out a scenario:-Spawn-Create a camp-Look for a gun-Find a gun-Get killed by someone with a gun-Restart and repeatEven if you strip back the fact that this game has no guns, and it doesn't make a difference to you, then this game still has, in my opinion, the most in depth crafting system I have ever seen. Along with constant updates to improve gameplay, the UI, and add content.			"

								My boyfriend bought the both of us this game, and we absolutely love it.  If you're looking for a survival/crafting/sandbox/MMORPG that differs from the other bigger titles (in the sense of you really have to work towards your survival and nothing is handed to you or is easy) with medieval flare, this is definitely something I recommend strongly.  From hunting to carpentry, herbology, healing, weapon building, leather tanning, cooking, farming, fishing, war-horse training, animal taming/breeding etc. the list goes on and on and each of your skills open the door for another.  Spending the time to level them is key.  Reaching each goal is a huge accomplishment because you do numerous steps to get there.  Of course it's alpha, and there are things still in the works/being added...but hey, that's alpha in any game.  Being a female gamer who usually refuses to play a male character, xD  the fact that I'm able to overlook this for the time being speaks volumes.  I highly anticipate/look forward to the female models being added.  If you can play  this with at least one other person, you are so set.  Each of you can specialize in your own set of skills, and work together to make mad progress.  So grab some friends, chase a boar around with a pitchfork, throw some rocks at a bear, and eat♥♥♥♥♥♥you find in the dirt to keep from starving!  After all Life is Feudal!			"

												I reccomend this title, tentatively, for you see it is very niche. If your looking for a fast paced game, steer clear, this game moves slowly, and methodically. And while you CAN play it alone, it is so much more beneficial, and enjoyable to play with others, Even if its just ONE other person.The more I watch development the more more they add, the more they refine, the better it runs. It really is great.If I had anything Negative to say about it, is that I cant boot up a local lan multiplayer without having all players ONLINE connected to the internet, because the game just wont boot without network access.So thats a 7/10 from me, let me run this from an offline location, for some good Local Lan fun, and I'd have nearly nothing negative to say about this game other than the fact I need a better computer to get the most out of it!

												This is one of the best games I've ever played. It's truly epic in scale and will require a ton of your time, however. You can't even begin to scratch the surface in just a few hours of game time. Notice everyone who doesn't give this game a positive rating, has like 1.3 hours in game. You cannot experience this game in that short a time. One of the main things I love about this game is the skill cap, there are a lot of area's to focus your character, but with the skill cap you won't be able to do learn and master every skill, so it forces people into factions and guilds where people can pool their talents and come together to form epic power centers, and that's what this game really requires. Once you have enough people together, you can create entire villages, and then castles, create armies, raid, pillage, go to war. Factions lay claim to territory, and I've even seen entire regions banding together, north v south, and battling for supremacy of a server. I can't stress enough how awesome this game is, but it is a time suck, it's a grind a lot of the time, but the rewards are immense. 11/10			"

												This game was very GOOD. I thouroughly enjpoyed the mix of crafting and survival elements involved in the intrensic design of the game. the visuals are very retro, the squares and triangles are very artistic. The game is designed to make you think about the real world because the controls have to be figured out by trial and error. Just to keep the game interesting, it will remove your ability to lok around, for the purpose of iintuitive gameplay. SPOILERS, the boars in this game are the ultamate end game bgoss, they dont need to follo0w game rules, will walk through anything, and kill you, also they cannot die. I find this to be a play and exploration of our capitalist society and the way we socialy condition -peoiple to follow authority.

								This game is like the next Minecraft, but in 3D.  It's starting out just as funky and buggy and lacking, in my opinion, however I can see that it's turning into something darn great.  The only real issue I have so far is all the darn progress bars.  I don't really like them, I'd much rather have a minecraft-esque style of harvesting things.  By that I mean more live-action; if you held down left mouse button to harvest bark or search for things instead of just click and let a progress bar fill I feel it would be more engaging.  It could be something along the lines of every tick there's a %chance based on your skill and other variables that you get whatever item you're trying to get, be it flint, bark, etc.  And making it so there's little mini games for fishing and the like would be pretty great too, I feel.  Yet, honestly, that's really my only complaint.There are a few issues with terrain generation, yet I'm sure they'll get that smoothed out.  I mean I saw seams in the terrain where there was nothing but void beneath them.  It was kinda amusing, actually.  Similarly I'm sure they'll get more tooltips into the game that explain more stuff.  While it's great to have it like Minecraft where very little is actually explained in the game, the fact that the simplicity of Minecraft isn't there makes it so that things like descriptive tooltips and the like are absolutely needed so I'm sure they'll work on that as they already have some good tooltips in the game.I've never liked the idea of having to go to an external site or having to watch video tutorials to get even the basics of a game, I've always found that to be clunky, especially when a simple pop-up tutorial on the basics would serve the player far better.  I'm not saying that everything needs to be explained, yet the basics should at least be pointed out so the player doesn't have to stumble through the first couple of days wondering where or how on earth to get flint or rock.Overall it's an excellent start to a truly extraordinary game, it's beautiful, it's entertaining, it's engaging, and for being in alpha it's already impressively well done.  If you're not interested in the bugs and troubleshooting but you still want to play a sandbox-builder game with surprisingly beautiful graphics and good gameplay then this is, without a doubt, a game you absolutely want to follow and keep your eyes on, there's great things coming from this, I'm sure.  If, however, you actually don't mind, or even like, being part of the testing process, random crashes, strange bugs, and all that jazz AND want to play a game like I just mentioned then this, right now, is completely for you.  You can be a part of gaming history and usher in a truly unique and amazing game!			"

								This game is set in such an immersive world that seems realistic (In its own aspects) to be a part of.  Its mainly not a game to be played solo, but rather with a group of friends or even random stranges.  Progression in this game does not happen quickly, so those looking for instant gratification should look elsewhere.  Though your progression is slow it brings a great sense of satisfation when you turn something like a hillside into a sprawling village surrounded by large stone walls!  The thrill of building up a force to move on an enemy emplacement cant be rivaled by many other games.  This game has a lot to offer in the present and promises great things for the future.  All in all its a fun and involved game to play and i recomend it to someone looking for a more adult experience to gaming or anyone looking for a good mideavil sandbox game! The community is mostly friendly and  helpful but remember...When all is said and done...LIFE IS FEUDAL!			"

								Life is Feudal, or what my friends and I have started to call it: Serf Simulator 2014, is a hardcore survival/build it all/kill the bad guy kind of game. It has been compared to Rust, DayZ, and Mount and Blade. To be honest, it does relate in different ways to all of these. You can build forever like Rust, the combat is very similar to Mount and Blade from what I have experienced so far, and you have to well...survive, like DayZ. Except no zombies. Life is Feudal seperates itself heavily from these in that you have to do every little thing. This can be tedious, but in my opinion makes everything worth it once it's all done. Building a simple shack is so rewarding and makes you feel like you've made serious progress. That's only just the beginning though. There is a slew of skills to learn, buildings to construct, and players to make relations with....for the better or worse. Every character in the game is a player, which makes the world either very community-like or very dangerous. You won't be able to do everything on your own. You must either find friends online, or invite your friends to join you. Characters have a skill cap and you must master certain skills to reach the furthest depths of that skill set. You'll need friends to provide resources from other skill trees to balance everything you work on.Anyways, I've gone on long enough. I do love this game and absolutely cannot wait to see what the devs have in store for the MMO version of this. Oh, and to top everything off the game has only been out a couple of weeks and the devs have already released three patches. That's a good sign for the future.7/10. This is purely because of this game being in Alpha. There are definitely bugs and glitches, but the overall gameplay is not affected heavily by them. I could see my rating going up with future patches.			"

								This game has it's issues for sure, and it is a bit pricey, but it is updated regularly and a beast of a timesink sandbox. Don't sit down when you only have 30min to 1hr to play.  You really, REALLY, have to work for everything.  I understand most people want to be done up in the greatest with a full base built in under 2 hours so they can kill another player before someone tells them it's bedtime, that's fine, play something else.  This game makes you work for what you want, and work hard. My friend once described it like this - ""Man, if I get hungry and want a sandwich I gotta start an epic quest chain just to make the mayo.""  And its practically true.  Though that's what draws you in.  Once you put the last shaped granite rock into your keep and see it before you as the rest of the server stands jealous, you almost feel nerd-proud, hah.The best thing I could say, is watch every video on it you can sit through and make Your Own (see what I did there) decision.

								As of early access game, it is a very nice game. It has a lot of potencial in it's gameplay and mechanics. Gathering resources and shoveling will take almost all of your time. Combat is glitchy. There is a set distance between your oppenent and you. If you are close to him, you can't hit him. Game needs improvements on combat mechanics and most importantly object placing. You can place objects in the air, floating. This makes no sense and people use it to jump over other players walls.Overall, game might get boring, but worth trying.			"

								Holy Sh*t this game rocks, especially for an early access in alpha. Yeah it has it's share of bugs (mostly audio), but when you have a game this massive it will have it's share of bugs to iron out of course. To put this in perspective, I'll just quickly state that in 3 days of grinding in the following games; Rust, 7 Days to Die, Nether, and in The Forest you are ready to tear up some fools with an array of weapons and a solid base site (No building in Nether though). In Feudal after 3 days, I didn't even have a single building or a weapon yet. Was too busy leveling up all these stats. Basically as a 30 year old gamer, I am impressed with this game so far.			"

												There are many people who give this game♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it's because they haven't played enough of it to actually see what this game has in store. Now, i will say that this game is very boring alone, you will need a group to play with, you can find one very easily in-game. The devs are working on a massive MMO for this game which will probably be able to play for all LiF:YO owners near october. If you like RoK or games like that i think you will like this game, and if not, you can always refund it!			"

												I love this game, I really do. The pvp, the crafting, but this whole ""full release"" is complete BS, it plays more of a beta than anything. Expect tons of bugs and expect even more bugs when they release hotfixes. Do I recommend this game? Yes! Do I still play this game more than any other game I have. Yes. Will I keep playing this game. Yes. But if you're expecting a non-laggy, unbuggy game, then look for another game because this isn't for you, but if you're willing to ignore the bugs time to time, you're going to have a great time playing this game.MidnightServer: Kingdom of Arkhaya.

								I picked this game up almost day one. remember this is very early alpha, with this said the game has had a better launch then some AAA titles.Im not going to get in to the this is the best game out there. But the game is the best in its genre, though.is it worthe the cash they are asking? yes! for the cost you will be getting two games.  One - LIF:YO stand alone Sadbox mosr or less as the game stands now plus addons as we go. Two - LIF:MMO A full 15th century MMO, with full town building system, full PvP combat , Full siege warfare and so much more. RP will be at its best, I cant wait.I have waited since UO for a game like this to come along, and fill the voild UO and EQ left. if you want a game that make you feel like its '99 or before all over again then this game is for you. For the ones to young to remember the days of great gaming, come by the game and join us.			"

With that said there are some points that will upset people but its nothing new to alpha games. The biggest downfall to this game is the high price I still believe it is worth it though, but if you find it on sale you better hit the corner to get the money to buy this damn game and get addicted.

												As im closing in on the 5k hours (including the mmo beta) i think its time i say what i think of this gameI will have to say this is the best game of all times ..not gta 5 not witcher 3 not any of the other games out there ..THIS IS THE BESTlet me try to explain you start up new to the game and 1 of 3 things will happen ..1. you begin making a base alone ...DONT this is will ruin the game for you and you will not get the experience out of the game it deservs2. you are unlucky and run into a group of bandits or a wild animal both will most likely kill you ..but dont let it ruin the game for you as you now how a enemy (if its bandits ofc)3. now this is how the game is meant to be played ... FIND A GOOD GUILD one that knows what they are doing this can be hard but with luck and asking around who the big boys on the block is should do the trick ...almost all guilds wants more hands so now its just joining up..... now some ppl think they can play only as a soldier or whatever ...that will ruin the game aswell pvp is a big part but to get pvp you need to also craft the best people in our kingdom is both crafters and fighters  ....shortly be helpfull is the key as its a team effort game now life is feudal has come a long way in the almost 2 year i have played and the devs are very active and you can talk with them ...basicly the dream team of devs as they are there for the players ..NO PAY TO WIN .....  sure there is bugs like in all other games but the bugs are limited now and there is updates almost weekly now what is life is feudal about ... its about YOU ... you make your own story ... if you play your cards right you might end up as a king of a large guildI HIGHLY RECORMENT THIS GAME... open world ... free terrafroming so you can change the area to however you want it.. awsome crafting system... beutifull grafic... devs for the gamers ... good combat system ... free building system where not 2 cities is the same only downside is life is feudal: your own as this game is meant to be played in the mmo and you get acces by having Life is feudal: your own... but lucky this is comming...soon :wink:			"

												One of the most innovative, interesting and exciting games that I have played in a long time. However, it is definitely not for everyone.This game is more akin to games like Shadowbane and UO: Online of old and the more recent Darkfall. I really feel like it catches the atmosphere of living in Feudal times. One must survive in a open, dynamic world that is completely controlled by players. One can choose to live their Feudal life as they see fit.A good deal of the game is crafting and building. Not only that but it takes a good deal of time to get anything done. For these reasons, I find that many are turned off by it. However, it is such a rewarding game for those who value creating one's own settlement and then getting involved in the world around them in whatever ways they see fit.The combat system is quite good yet takes a bit of time to get used to. Once you get used to it, though, you will most likely really enjoy it. It takes a more realistic approach to combat, where one must learn the range of your weapon and must aim at body parts for maximum affect. It is definitely not an easy system to master and takes practice to get good at it.The only drawback that it has is it is still developing and you will run into small bugs and issues that need resolving. I feel that it is a constant work in progress.That being said, if you like the idea of an open, dynamic, Feudal world where you make your own way, and you don't mind having to put lots of time to accomplish it, then I can say look no further than this game!

								I have been playing games since the early 80s. This is by far the game that I have been waiting for all along. It is still early access, but with the minor bugs and steep learning curve it is already by far the best game on the market for gamers. I have been playing around mostly on my own private server, learning the mechanics. Hats off to everyone involved in the development and testing of this game. This is the game changer in my opinion. I was with minecraft since launch and was waiting for something more polished. Upon making my first weapons I ventured out to hunt a boar. I had an epic battle, both of us falling unconcious at one point or another. One small gripe is when my enemy is passed out I would like the ability to do a kill shot. I had a pitchfork and could not get the stabby motion working properly. I wound up beating on him. The combat is reminiscent of Mount&Blade, another I have been with since launch & have 7 days to die. This combines the best of all of them into a rich and vivid world. Please make more LiF:YO maps. I already want snow and desert landscapes, 3kmx3km is perfect size though. Hurry up and finish the MMO.... Take my money! Cuening			"

								It’s no secret that Life is Feudal (LiF) is not a complete game.  At the time that I write this, the game is still in an Alpha release.  However, as it stands today, LiF is possibly one of the best games that I have played.   I have played over 30 hours of this game and still cannot equip armour or weapons of any sort (my skill is not high enough).  Many of you are probably wondering how this is a good thing.  It means that the game is rich in detail.  You cannot start off the game and go out lopping off heads; it doesn’t work that way.  Rather, when you first start, you try to get enough to eat, scrabble together enough resources to craft simple tools, and then slowly (very slowly) you start to expand your universe.  I have never played a game that has such depth in the crafting or skill trees.  Sure, there is some grinding that you have to endure, but it is very satisfying once you have completed it and move up higher in the ranks.LiF is one of the best games I have ever played.  Seriously.  And it still has not been released yet.  Think of how much better it will be when it is completed! "

Posted: November 26, 2015
												So I bought this game on a whim because a friend of mine ask me to buy it too, and I did, and I did not regret. Beforehand, I read all the review that is people deemed most helpful, saw that it got a lot of bugs here and there, unplayable graphics, etc. And you know what? The first time I ran it on my laptop, it got shutdown my laptop right away when I'm loading the world from some server. Disappointed? Very. I could run Fallout 4 on my laptop albeit getting 20-28 fps so I wonder why can't I run this game? Simple, the optimization at release is quite poor. So I did what a someone with a brain will do, play it on my PC. And thankfully, it run greatly. No gamebreaking graphic bug encountered, which seems to be the main complain of most reviews here, no crash at all from all of my time playing this game, and I can play this game flawlessly albeit it does hit 22 fps in dense forest.So we have that out of the way, now what will you expect by buying this game? Firstly, one thing that you can expect is poor optimization, yes I admit the graphic is quite heavy even for my spec which could run witcher 60 fps with high 1080p setting, and fallout 4 flawlessly too. But it's understandable since almost everything can be interacted with, so the game is heavy because of that. And no, if you compare it to fallout 4, that game is still light in building things since you didn't interact with most of the game, just place things on the ground, while in LiFYO, YOU CAN TERRAFORM THE TERRAIN, my suspicion is that the game is heavy because of this, but let's leave it at that. So, heed that recommended spec before you buy it, does your computer spec meet or above the requirement? If yes, you don't have to worry a thing (possibly), if no, buy it at your own risk. Luckily though, the dev is quite fast on implementing fast hotfixes. Secondly, this is not a simple survival building crafting game, where all you need to do is know the recipe, have the material and then voila, it appears. Nope, you need to LEARN HOW TO DO IT FIRST. It got a complex skill tree where there're a few skill you need to learn first before you get to the skill you needed. Tedious? Very. Boring? Not so. Which is why having a group or making friends in-game is very valuable. You don't need to be a jack of all trades, you just need to focus on what you want to be, and ask for help for something that is outside your capability. You could learn how to do it, but it will take a lot of time, and don't forget about that skill you want too, it takes time too. Wiki and youtube is your friend, seriously. They might be outdated but they are still relevant as much since it's still the same. The only problem I had with the wiki is, it's not very complete as I checked it a few days ago, some detailed bits are missing but the general explanation should suffice, if not, check the youtube, there's a lot of let's play and tutorial for life is feudal.Third, The UI in this game is simple enough. There's status bar, hotkey bar, general info, chat panel, etc. You can customize their position too with F10. Also the cursor and the movement mode can be switched with tab. Like the name imply, cursor mode is used to navigate to panels, while movement mode is used for camera while moving and interacting with the world. The interaction follows Ultima/Wurm online. Whereas right click to something brings up the context menu, and it doesn't take too long to familiarize with this system. Right click on the ground and it shows a square tile which show how big the area will be affected by terraforming or what we can do with that area. It's not everything has their keybinds, but each things have their context menu, and you can set the default action to do something to the left click, so all you need to do is point something and then left click.Lastly, this game emphasis on player to player interaction, so roleplaying is what it is in this game. You want to roleplay a blacksmith? Go ahead, level up your blacksmith skill, then advertise your service to some guilds or tribes you found. If you're lucky, they'll accept you as their own or you get tricked or worse you could be killed right away, the choices is theirs to make.  I warn you there's no human NPC in this game, only animals and such, so there will be a lot of human interaction.tl;drgreat game, very VERY time consuming, you have been warned,not for someone who wants a quick/easy/simple/straight jump to the action-ish game,needs time to learn the mechanic and enjoys the game,if you're familiar with ultima online/wurm online or the like of it, you'll feel very nostalgic,lots and lots of player to player interaction,heed the recommended spec,no gamebreaking bug which I encountered so far,buy it if you like it and it's at your own risks			"

Early Access Review
								First of all, do I recommend this game? YES!! I've been playing this game for a few days with a friend, so this is a review in progress. Let me start off by saying, this game, even in its current state.. is incredible. There's so much depth to it.. it's very expansive and there's endless possibilities. 9.5/10 Pros+It takes a very long time to gather resources and alter the terrain whilst building houses, and villages. That's a good thing. It makes it more immersive, realistic, and require teamwork. It also feels so rewarding when you complete a project you've been working on. So far, after 3 days.. me and my friend have managed to build 2 huts, a garden, fence, furnace, and blacksmithing station.. even though this seems extremely miniscule, I feel really proud.. like I accomplished something.. and we're planning on accomplishing much more. The more people you have in your group, the faster you can raise your village from the dirt. As long as everyone is working together of course. You'll never run out of things to do. +You also cannot specialize in all of the professions.. you can only specialize in 1 or 2.. maybe more depending on how you spend your points. So you will need to communicate with other players on what they are specializing in to fill that gap you need to efficently build your village. +It takes a LONG time to dig a tunnel+\- Combat? I'm a bit iffy on this one as I haven't had too many violent encounters. While the combat right now is in fact, buggy and the hitboxes are miles off, the concept is amazing and I think this is going to be improved. I got shot by a crossbow, in which I took off running and eventually collapsed from bleeding and then executed. This gave the combat many positive points in my book. As of right now, it will certainly suffice. But don't take my word for it, I've only beat a moose with a primitive axe and got shot with a bolt. I will update on this once I'm more experienced with the combat. Here are some of my nitpicks, or rather, suggestions on what it would take to make this game utterly perfect. -This is a big one. Currently, you need to specialize in certain equipment in order to actually use it. This is disappointing. You should be able to use any equipment, regardless of your expertise in it. Expertise should affect how well you use the equipment though. For example, a low level in Crossbow would make aiming shaky and inaccurate. A low level in Mail Armor would make your stamina drain faster. Ect. To not be able to use it at all is unrealistic.-When you die, a gravestone appears. This is immersion breaking. And here are some current alpha problems that are surely going to be smoothed out in time.-Crashing (a lot) -Lag-Bugs (of course)-Freezing -StutteringThese are all to be expected. But don't let them stray you away from this awesome game. For these issues to be present while I simultaneously give the game a 9.5, that means this game is GOOD. I can't explain it. It's just amazing. MANY hours are going to be spent on this game. :)			"

One thing that they dont mention though is that you will still be able to play life is feudal: your own after the mmo comes out, They said that it would be updated to a good condition close to the mmo and kept the same.

								Fabulous gameplay especially if your on a well maintained server.If you plan to solo play make sure to join a server with a skill cap of 3000 otherwise make sure to team up with some people as it makes your progression hugely faster.			"

								I have been playing games since the early 80s. This is by far the game that I have been waiting for all along. It is still early access, but with the minor bugs and steep learning curve it is already by far the best game on the market for gamers. I have been playing around mostly on my own private server, learning the mechanics. Hats off to everyone involved in the development and testing of this game. This is the game changer in my opinion. I was with minecraft since launch and was waiting for something more polished. Upon making my first weapons I ventured out to hunt a boar. I had an epic battle, both of us falling unconcious at one point or another. One small gripe is when my enemy is passed out I would like the ability to do a kill shot. I had a pitchfork and could not get the stabby motion working properly. I wound up beating on him. The combat is reminiscent of Mount&Blade, another I have been with since launch & have 7 days to die. This combines the best of all of them into a rich and vivid world. Please make more LiF:YO maps. I already want snow and desert landscapes, 3kmx3km is perfect size though. Hurry up and finish the MMO.... Take my money! Cuening			"

												I read a bunch of bad reviews regarding the click menu before I bought this game. I have played lots of Wurm in my days and comparing, I find  Life is Feudal to be much better than I expected! The menus include lots of clicking, yes, but in my opinion it is not so bad as some reviews claim it to be. The music is though very repetitive, luckily I can mute and put on my own soundtrack.I will definitely spend more hours in this game and explore it! If you like a grindy survival game with menus like Wurm and Runescape, then this is for you. The graphics are stunning. Some animations on the animals are a bit wonky. But so far I love the way the building mechanics work, I have a good control of what I am building and where with the help of a grid I can toggle on and off. The same grid shows numbers for slopes and it makes it so much easier to terraform and make the ground flat. Edit: Now I have spent more hours in this game and this is the best peasant simulator. 10/10 Will continue work the fields.			"

								First, you've got to understand this is an early alpha version of the game.  With that said, it's in a pretty advanced state and a lot of fun already. But here are a few key things to keep in mind: - Some things are not yet implemented. Actually a lot of things, but there is still a ton to do in the game. - This is not a quick action crafting/building game like Minecraft.  It takes hours (real time) to build a small mine looking for metal ores.  As you mine out a tunnel, you collect the rocks, you have to take those rocks and dump them somewhere or craft them into shaped stones (which are just as heavy as the rocks) so you must store them somewhere, then you can go back to mining.  It's a slow process...not for those who lack patience. For me it is relaxing, but your results may vary.- In fact getting your skills up to the point where you can even mine takes a long time.  On the default settings, it takes hours of using your skills to raise them to the point where you learn new things.  The settings are customizable so each server can adjust them to speed things (even to the point of the rediculous). - Single Player: There is essentially no single player (at least not in the normal PvE sense).  You can start a local server, make it private and no one else can join, then experiment all you want, but it will be a big lonely world.  I've split my time between experimenting on a solo local server and playing public servers.  Both are fun for me...  - Community: The server you join will make all the difference in terms of your enjoyment.  I've been servers where I was welcomed into a community, given a house, invited in to start working on my skills to be a productive member of that village.  And I've been on servers where people have been complete jerks.  There are hundreds of servers, find one that suits you.TL;DR: If you're patient and looking for a slow paced, realistic game that is still in development, then this may be your game.  If you're looking for something with wall-to-wall action, keep looking, this ain't it.			"

								It's not often that I get super psyched by an alpha release. This is one of those magical exceptions.It's from Russia, and I love it. Life is Feudal is the sandbox I've been waiting for. Even in its alpha stage it has a load of content, and runs fairly well. That's saying something for me having an old laptop for a rig. The building is complex, you can sculpt every inch of the terrain, and there's more on the horizon. This version, ""LiF: Your Own,"" is the small-scale version of the planned MMO. This map is a few KM across, the eventual will be massive. This map holds 64 players. The eventual will hold thousands.I'm already super into this game, and I imagine I'll be unemployed once the MMO drops.			"

								If you like to grind, then grind your way into a medieval society!Complete with murder, hooliganism, deep crafting, realistic terraforming, vicious wolves and lootable player corpses.All buildings are built in-game by players, all communities are player constructed and completely different from one server to the next.Game is great fun, but consumes a lot of time - thankfully though, it is a time consuming game that can be casually enjoyed as well as you can always come back and continue working on your skills.I have several friends who won't play because the game isn't perfectly stable, so if you can't stomach glitches and poor optimization I would wait until the game is further updated for a more polished but I still reccomend it as is if early access issues don't bother you.

												I did make this a discussion but i felt it was a good review for the time being as of-(12/14/2015)there are sooo many bugs and crashes in this game its honestly incredible. I mean i love this game the concept and gameplay is exactly what im looking for in a game and i have logged over 100 hours so far but in that 100 hours has to have been at least 12-15 game crashes (a day) that i have sent to the devs. bugs like jobs im doing get stuck and dont complete and i have to relog. CRC check failed: repair needed < whatever that is. its just something special when you have to relog 6 times in 2-3 hours of gameplay. I LOVE THIS GAME. but the bugs can kill the fervor i have for completing my settlement. Is there any hope of updates for these problems casue i feel like they have made multiple updates ""fixing bugs"" and nothing has changed.Maybe im asking alot to have a stable game. IDK (sarcasm?) i just want this game to be perfect because its the best rendition of a survival-esk game out there.but for all the hard work that has been put into this game is awesome and i appreciate all the time and effort the devs put into the mechanics and gameplay. SO its not all bad its a great game with intense graphics that has the ability to be fantastic but the bugs and crashes can really get to you!			"

It doesn't look THAT bad. - To sum up the +, the idea is great.-The bugs. The glitches. The size of the world. The floating items. - The game can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ if you're having a war and someone knows how to take benifits from the glitches. Makes the walls useless. With some bug/glitch fixing and a bigger world, this would be a really awesome game. I would recomend to try it thou', but you need some (alot) parience.			"

												I had this game for a long time but only recently I decided to rent my own server for myself and friends to play.Now this is like my virtual home.At first I did play it as survival game, looking for food and some primitive instruments.Then settled on the lakeside and mined some copper to craft some tools.Then enabled Admin mode to play around and test a blueprint for my future settlements.Leveling ground for the keep takes time even in GM/Admin mode but placing down and walking around it is a lot of fun.Not sure I am going to keep it, because it does not seem to be very practical.Summer solstice is coming, so I created place to celebrate it. Found a hill where You can observe a dawn, put down a few benches, campfire and a watchtower with a fire lighted up. And it looks great!Looking forward to having a great party!			"

												Where to begin?Life is Feudal should ideally be played with a group.This game is entirely playable for a solo player, but your enjoyment will likely suffer greatly alone.Most complex building tasks are entirely too grindy when attempted solo, but servers are full of cooperative people willing to show you the ropes. I reccomend either buying this game to play with friends, or searching out a group to join asap once you get started.While I am not a roleplayer, this game has a vast potential for roleplaying, and skill caps can be setup to create an economy where every character is forced to specialize rather than max every skill. The social aspect of this game is what makes the grind feel worthwile.The grind can be partially mitigated by server customization as well. Servers with XP settings between 25-100x the default are common. The learning curve is a bit steep, and crafting can be complex.This game has a significant PvP component, and allows players to beseige each others lands. This means potentially looting and burning weeks of work in one day, but creates real risk, and winning a battle feels significant.The times and dates for this can be customized, and PvE servers exist as well for the feint of heart.In all likelyhood you will either love this game or uninstall it in under 2 hours. Most of this depends on your choice to play alone or with others. "

Keep in mind it is also in Early Access with developers improving things at quite a nice rate, a lot better than most other early accesses on Steam.

								With friends, with hours put into your work, with all the benefits of every item or items you get, feels like a gift. It truly tests your devoting skills and time, playing with others makes things run smoother. If you solo this stuff your life will crumble at the time it takes to do things or you'll just be a hermit in his/her hut. encouraging others to help you out or encouraging you to interact with others makes this game special. I personally loved this game even if the time was long and hard, the reward was nice and the gloating was amazing. You can work to make so many things, many more features to be added. I love the game and cannot wait for the other features to be added. I recommend this for devoted builders and people that strive to challange themselves in creating or destorying other Feudal lives.			"

ALPHA REVIEW: I understand the game is in Alpha, but I'm just pointing on my thoughts on the current state of the game. I would recommend this game to help support the developers as I really like the game and it looks as though is has a bright future with a lot of playablility, especially when enjoyed with a group of friends.A few people have asked for my opinions on this game, so here they are.The Good:1. The visuals of the game are really nice. The whole thing looks atmospheric, deep forests, rich villages and nice vistas give the player a nice experience from just walking around. 8/102. The Ideas that the game portrays are very good. There's a very in-depth crafting system and a good building placement system which have little floors but there could be a bit more done to liven them up a bit. 7/103. The general gameplay is very nice. Being able to enjoy it with your friends is great and the contact currently in the game is brilliant! There's a lot of fun to be had here!The bad:1. Performance. I run this game with a 3.4GHz i5 processor and a GTX780 NVIDIA graphics card. If I bump the settings up a bit from the defaults, maybe I increase the tree/terrain detail a bit, my FPS drops a large amount, heading down towards 20FPS. But the game is ENTIRELY playable on the default settings and still looks really good, I'm just not sure how it will run on lower processors/cards.2. Terrain interaction. The way that you interact with terrain/rocks/trees in this game is very bulky. You look at a tree/terrain segment and are faced with about a dozen options, which for a new player is quite overwhelming. Everything is based on: ""Look down at terrain"" -> ""Click"" -> ""Select option"" -> ""Animation plays"" -> ""You get things"". There is currently no real player interaction with the environment around you.The Ugly:1. The UI. Some elements of the UI, mainly linked with the terrain interaction above don't look or feel very nice. But this is an Alpha and that can change VERY easily.I will certainly be playing more of this game with a few friends of mine.

								I Recommend this game, I have put in over 600 hours in this alpha and i cant stop playing. Yes it has bugs, but its an Alpha. After playing as much as I have, I still find myself doing new things each day, and having new experiences. Making good friends and building a community that is devoted to the creation and development of this game. If your looking for a finnished product, then you need to learn what the word ALPHA means in game development terms. I say this cause all these negative reviews do not do this game justice. Remember haters are going to hate, but if you just look at this as an opportunity to be apart of a game's development. To be able to say: I helped in the development and creation of, a not just good, but potentially GREAT game. Then this is more then worth the price of this game.			"

												Good concept, bad execution. The game is built on an old 32 bit engine that limits its use of RAM, resulting in server crashes, and loads of buggy features. There are many combat bugs in the game that the devs dont fix. You can be decked out in the best of the best, then some guy, naked with just his fists, can use a combat bug to one shot you nonstop. Arrows have ghosting problems, Game is overwhelmingly grindy. The most recent patch even reduced the amount of resource you get for a particular proffession by 75%, making the game even grindier. No optomization at all,things break nonstop, corrupt fils force server restarts to happen often, resulting in all your hard work being lost. Is this game worth its price? No.  Avoid the headache and pick up a better optomized game that isnt plauged by game breaking bugs.			"

								Grown men chopping wood, cleaning out chicken coops, leveling ground, making soup and hunting moose sound like fun?  Well, it is in Life is Feudal!  Actions build skills, skills are necessary to aquire the ability to do more.  Castles need building, you don't just get to walk up to your own pre-built structure.  There are dangers in the forest and apples to find to keep you alive.  The resource and tech tree in this game is perhaps the most detailed I have ever seen in a game.  There is drudge work, but the reward is seeing a castle that you are building come to life.  With enough armor, weapons, skills and friends, it will then be time to find a few serfs to do the drudge work for you.My best wishes to the developers of this game to work out the bugs, create an ingame economy, an inplement all the cool features that are still in development.  This game has ALL the potential to be one of the all time great ones!			"

												**DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY**You're not buying a complete game.You're not buying a finished product.You're not buying a concept that hasn't been done before, and better.Want good PVP? There are plenty of good FFA/Full Loot/Permanent PVP MMO's that do this better, smoother and look better.Want medieval simulation? Again, there's MANY better options out there.Want to be a King/Knight/Soldier? Yup, that's been done elsewhere too.BS MMO projects like this one have come and gone over the years, and many others with much more potential have gone under for lack of funding or interest. Don't give these clowns your money. What you DO get: a small host-your-own-server-or-pay-for-one version of what they actually dumped the EA funds into. Oh, but wait! You get one character slot on their MMO server when they're done. At the (presumably) same price they'll charge for a character slot. Yippee.			"

								Read before you buy!First off, this game has mixed reviews. So I would just like to remind those reading, that this game is still in very early access. With the engine the game uses, it's advancements, and everything the devs are trying to do, it will take time for full release, possibly even a year or 2. With that in mind, don't judge this game based on everything currently in it, things can and will change.Now that that's out of the way, let me start by saying yes, this game is a grind (as of now). Why? Because this game was built for realism. Rome wasn't built in a day, nor will you build your small shack in one. This game is realistic in almost every aspect, between it's physics based combat system which doesn't require you to aim at someone, to its resource gathering, and construction system. Even its mining system requires you to use supports otherwise you risk a cave in. And while it may be a graphics hog, that's because it's still not very optimized, but as I have said it's only an alpha. However, you can't deny that the game looks really good. Can you guys imagine on the full release, with around 1000 people on one world, what the game will look like in a month? Think about it, you start in an area with nothing but trees and such, along with 999 other people. One month later, you have huge medieval cities with giant walls, lined with trebuchets and ballistas. Huge wars going on between player factions. We can literally recreate historical events in this game with how well it's been designed and planned. So, if you're still reading, then you know this game is a very realistic game. So please, don't judge this game just because it's realistic. Judge it for it's aspects, judge it for it's gameplay. If you don't like realism, don't judge it at all. Besides, if you don't like realism, why would you be playing a game like this? What it all boils down to is if you like realism like I do, and billions of others do as well, then this game may just be for you. However that depends on what degree of realism you like. If you don't like the grind (which may or may not be fixed later on and shortened) then you may not like this. So TL;DR, if you like realism, but don't like a grind, this isn't for you. If you like realism, it might be for you. This game is highly based on realism, so if you don't like realism at all, why are you here? It's still alpha, so don't judge based on how the game works now, base your reviews and judgements off of the actual gameplay.			"

												This game is truly a masterpiece when it comes to sandbox survival games.It is all there needs to be to make a successful game of the genre. For one i would say the best feature is the hardcoreness and the complexity of the mechanics and how the game works. Sure the game could be even more complex which developers are working hard to deliver (new features etc), sure it could have NPCs and better AI but in its current state it's truly worth the price.If you have been let down by the multitude of early access medieval survival games spamming this overcrowded market, you should get this one and stick to it until the end. The game has close to no bugs at the moment, the developers are close to the community, the road map is respected by days or even hours, this is not a hit and run like many other early access games.The graphics are astonishing, the game runs well on any PC (the only issue which is not really an issue are loading screens when joining a server taking too long if you don't run the game in windowed mode).All in all, i recommend this game fully, if you are looking for some fun and rewarding experience. Disclaimer : If you are looking for a spoon fed baby's first minecraft-like experience this game is not for you.  "

								As of right now, this game is not worth playing unless you like testing games and looking for bugs.  The combat animations need a lot of work.  Weapons and armor do not work properly (read: naked guys one shotting people in full plate and combat that is really twitchy)Some guild tools were added but need to be reworked or just redone e.g. the Monument that creates the protected area isn't a large enough usable space.....and for some reason the protected area is a circle and the buildings are all square; very strange.It has potential, but needs plenty of work.

								Idea is nice but you need have plenty friends to Co-op together to build...I think it is too early version at the moment, as lot of functions is not implemented yet. And I didnt like building - as u can build only buildings which is provided in menu - what mean u cant make ur own house design (like it is for example in 7 Days to die) . Of course this two games is not comparable as 7 Days to die is like kid game if compare with this - as you need learn skills to do simple things like cutting trees etc . Getting resources is long job - to build simple shack will take some while... My opinion - game is in wright direction but at the moment it is too early and not everyone will like this stile. My valuation  6 from 10 at moment...			"

												Game was playable at 1st, but then they started to add upgrades, like the guild system. I know it's a early access game, but i believe yopu still could have checked the upgrades before you released them, if any had tried it you would have seen it wasn't good. The game is un-playable as it stands now, i suggest you wait till they get there♥♥♥♥♥♥together, maybe in a few years.Ok i played the game again, still has sound bugs, and i like that the tunnels will collaapse after not used awhile, it saves alot on lag, but even after i reinforced my ore mine which i was getting great stuuf from it still collapsed. Digging/ making tunnels for ore is worse then it was before, when you hit a Quality change it bugs out your charecter shutters around and you can't do anything, and after some of my tunnel collapsed i tried to get back in it, but had that same problem, i could see the other in front of me, and the tunnel was made but i couldn't walk through it, after a few more days of playing and it is enjoyable with friends, after you get a hang of it, i still recommend strongly not to bother until they have a permenant solution to the tunneling, you will spend evey day trying to dig back out what you already made, ie BULL Crap!@			"

												Right. So, this one is a bit conditional, i can't just say ""Yes or No.""Ok, do you like rust style gameplay?Do you like combat similar-ish to Chivalry/Mount&Blade?Do you have a lot of free time?Do you have at LEAST two other people to play with, or are you willing to join a random group on a server? (3 other people or more recommended)If you answered YES to at elast three out of the four questions, you'll love it. Just like I did. Sadly my group got bored and i sort of ell off. You CAN NOT solo this game. You can not be a jack of all trades. Think of it as medieval rust, but much more serious feeling; more realistic, more time consuming, etc. Again, in rust you find a blueprint, and you can build it. In LiF, you have all the blueprints, but you need the skills to use them. You chop trees, you become a better lumber jack. You cut wood, you become a better carpenter. You mold stone, you become a better mason. You CAN NOT be a jack of all trades. The more you specialize, the better, but you have to fill all roles to prosper. So, the beauty of other players comes in. If you have a person for each role, you can all fully excel - OR you can spread yourselves among two or three trades, lowering your specialization and skill in each, but making up for the lack of people. In other words, the main limiting factor is the number of people you need. if a few people get bored, its over for all of you unless you can replace them. So, if you can get a group of people you trust to commit, or if you can join a server and are willing to ask in chat to join someone long term (wouldnt recommend, the early game was my favorite, watching your mud huts evolve to cabins, to outposts, to pallisades, to castles is an amazing thing and joining late game when they're fully militarized robs you of that joy... however it is useful for learning the ropes.)But as much as the intensive human cost is a con, it is also a pro for the game. Playing with friends in it is amazing, as you're all working together for a common long term goal. the interactions are great, and there's a nice social aspect.Speaking of such, i would love to get back into the game. If a group of people needs an extra sword at your side, feel free to message me, be you a group of friends jsut getting the game, or just people that need to replace someone or expand.			"

												I got this game from the Humble Bundle, at a friend's recommendation, and I'm very happy that I did. (I'd definitely recommend that you wait until it's on sale before purchase, but that's just because of the state of the game. It's constantly being patched though, which is nice.)It's a very complicated game, and if you don't like to ask for advice or use the Wiki to get an idea of what you should be doing, then this game isn't for you (YET) - keep in mind that most servers have a very helpful playerbase, though, as they all started where you are! Skill caps can be painful (though some servers have it set at 3000, which means with time you can do everything yourself if you want to keep busy), but do encourage a grouping mentality and specialisation, which is nice. I've made some good friends on the game already.If you're playing on a server where Judgement Hour and Decay are in effect, suit up and claim up respectively. I've found that PVPers enjoy using JH as an excuse to grief or troll, as it doesn't reduce your alignment to 'commit crimes' during this time; if you're a bandit outside of it, your alignment decreases and your name changes from white, to orange and then to red below -50. It does, however, encourage tactics and teamwork, whether offensive or defensive, amongst your guild.Decay is what keeps each server clean. Items off-claim decay and are destroyed at a pre-assigned (by the GM) rate, or not at all on some servers. It's easy to tell because damage effects are applied, and it's just better to make even a tier-1 monument claim and store all your stuff on it, than to lose it all the time.Server Wipes are done on many servers every few months; I've avoided servers with server wipes, so I can't really judge, but I'd rather avoid my hours of hard work being put to the torch!Best Advice: If you want to travel fast and ride horses eventually, set Warhorse Handling to 60 at character creation. It is by FAR the most painful skill to level otherwise!			"

												Okay this game is clearly got both pro and cons but i think by time this game will be good as update comes , Pro: This game got plenty variant of status and attribute each attribute has it own uses very variantly and many ways u can raise it, Graphic is totally good, This game is a good game of teamwork, and of course it's medieval and no microtransaction. Cons: This game has less average player, for a new gamer this game will be a hard game to learn, some bug stuck still there where ur character will animated falling infinite times if you slipped away from slope and got obstacle behind it, lack of animal variants ( perhaps under development ) , TAKES A LONG TIME TO MAKE castle, and requires teamwork , All ranged weapon is hard to hit in combat for newbie i think, Graphic Memory issues and Loading time too long. beside that i hope soon got heraldity and marriage features , and 1 thing , not variant of skin appearances .

												I really enjoyed the pace of Life is Feudal. This game makes you feel accomplished for everything you build. Just leveling the ground takes hours, and gathering materials makes the game feel genuine. Me and 3 of my friends spent 80+ hours making our small out of the way village.  Hauling lumber up to our encampment was an all day task. One friend collected ore, and another smithed it. While me and my other friend leveled ground, and built structures. Our base was finally coming together and then it happened...the server we were on got restarted because only like 5-10 people were coming on anymore. We haven't played together since. The biggest issue I had when I played was that when the new day started the whole server would lag for a minute.			"

												In this game you're free to do whatever you want to do - but better you have some friends to play this game with you. You can specialise yourself on whatever you want to - building, collecting, farming, hunting or fighting to protect your newbuild city! But everything takes time...Every player starts with nearly nothing - you have to gather branches, stones, herbs and food to survive and to get knowledge of producing stuff like weapons, buildings and so on. If you have some friends you can share the tasks - one for example is the farmer & cook, one searches for metal, one gets knowledge of weapons, the other one is the blacksmith ..... it really makes fun - the more you are, the better! there are no enemies, except youll decide to be one!

								THis is that game you've always dreamt of yet always been dissapointed when others have tried to create. the world is extensive, complex and dangerous yet the KOS culture of Rust has been avoided and instead teamwork is the neccessity as things take time and particulary focuses to accomplish anything of import. Of course there is always the fighting for those that are interested and that keeps it from being just another sandbox game where you hit one thing and put it down some where else.Already those of us who have played this are craving the MMO and would love to see even a sketchy version come out so that we could comprehend the awsomeness. Keep up the good work devs, the constant updates and quick response times make you guys a rare group!Best game Ever!!			"

For what LiF lacks in character creation, however, it makes up for in gameplay... Kind of. A lot of the fun for me came from joining servers and creation storylines with random people.

When you bring screenshots to discord or his attention he bans you and removes all content so he can look good to all.			"

												If you've ever wanted a simulation of what it's like to live in a medieval world, look no further. Life is Feudal brings the best aspects of several other games and mixes them together for a product that is on the mark. Despite being in development stages and with a limited team, they've continually improved the game and brought out new features. It's a game that's true to its form, brutal, unforgiving, and immersive. It's what you make of it...and in a generation of gaming that's handing everything to everyone, that's as appealing as the rest.			"

												Don't be fooled by all the negative reviews. Life is Feudal is a really wonderful game.It is not an EASY game by any means. I do not reccomend playing it alone. Get four or five good friends to play with you or join a server. Life is Feudal is a cooperative game. You can scrape by on your own, sure, but you won't advance past the Stone Age. If you think you can log on, build a castle in two hours, and log off, you've got another thing coming. LiF doesn't hand you goodies on a silver platter. If you've got a hardworking team of people, though, you can accomplish some really awesome stuff. For example: my boyfriend and I joined a server and started working toward building a house of our own. We felt insanely accomplished when we managed to build two hovels and kill a stag. It was an enormous rush! LiF makes you work for every single thing you get. As a result, the rewards matter a lot more. We eventually joined up with a bigger town and became Master Armorsmiths. It was amazing to see our hard work pay off. It gave me a sense of accomplishment unlike any other game I've played.LiF is hard and can be pretty punishing. But the difficulty makes your rewards that much more awesome. You understand the value of an item because you worked hard to get it. Here are the bad parts: the games crashes frequently and load times are awful. Except to spend 5-10 minutes per load screen. Plus, it's a memory hog. Buyer beware if you're running it on a laptop or an older PC.			"

								This game is probably the best survival based multiplayer game I've ever played. It takes a lot of elements from really good survival games like Day Z, Rust, and many others. Combines them and makes the perfect survival game. The main thing about this game that I love is the focus on community. To be able to get far in this game you need other people, plain and simple. The only thing I don't like about this game is the combat tree parts of it really don't make sense, but hey it's in alpha so I'm sure they'll tweak it here and there before release. If you're considering buying life is feudal do it and make sure you get some friends to do it as well.			"

								This game is not fun, but you still play it. When you're in a community its like your duty to play this game. After mining for 3 days, mining for gold it clicked... this sucks. ....but they need this gold!! I must continue. You constantly stare at a green progress bar, everything you do you must stare at that green bar. You can't make macros either, no simple ones anyways. Before you invest your money into this fairly expensive early access game you'll need to know a few things. Don't plan to play this alone, this game is definitely for you and at least 2 other people if you want to get anywhere. It is a great game and most of its current features are solid, but as you play you'll realise that even to build the smallest house you'll need a few different professions first. With limited skill points you must specialize and so will your friends all depending on each other. I recommend this game as a temporary thing for a big group of friend. Minimum 3 people to play this game. If you play alone don't buy this game.			"

								Life is feudal is way to early in development to give any accurate fullscale ''review''.However I can give it my thoughts, and in the end Ill only recommend it or not.So pros;An amazingly detailed crafting system(imo) Non targetting combatVisuals are satisfying Gameplay*SoundtrackCons;Sounds, (not all of them, but alot of them)Crafting system will limit your progress when you are playing soloHalf of the skills not Implemented yetAlot of time will be spent looking at a progress barAlpha feel to the game (chunky, some stuff dont work, a few bugs and crashes)Conclusion;So if you can get your friends together, and you can get past the alpha feel of the game, and dont care to much about progress bar. If you punch through those cons you will be greeted by some great settings and if you got your friends to come along with you, then youll have hours after hours of gameplay. Personally I have to recommend this early alpha to fans of the genre, its not amazing, not claiming that, however there certainly are some great potential.For more info about the game features, see, ''Life is Feudal'' website			"

								When I first saw this game (I forget where) I thought it was the game of dreams. An open world sandbox MMORPG set in a a medeival setting. Then I noticed the steep price of £25 (or your regional equivalent). However after seeing the trailer and some streams of the game in action I was convinced. For an alpha it runs quite well with the expected bug here and there but hey, its an alpha. Most the the games terraforming and building mechanics are pretty much to point but could do with some polishing. With frequent updates and bug fixes it gives me a good reason to trust the devs behind this game.After playing for hours alone I realised I needed to either find some friends to join me on my adventure though the world and increase chances of survival. Or find a friendly group of players who will accept me into their community. (Dont expect everyone to be friendly, this is the medeival ages). As I mentioned after hours of play with friends we finally have a little lake side village which is progressing nicely. A farm, some houses and soon to be a forge.We hope to gain some weapons soon and either :TAX THE PEASANTS (other players)orHunt down criminals (Bad rep players)However.The combat for ranged weapons is very clunky and can be unreliable. Melee is more reliable at the current moment but could really do with some work.Final opinion 8/10Pros:-Sandbox-Will soon be an MMORPG-Player driven-Strong sense of community-Highly addictiveCons:-Steep alpha price-Clucky combat in the current build			"

								Excellent early release project, not perfect but finding a good group of players more than makes up for it. Be aware that system requirements are a bit melty but its good fun and the promise of an MMO of this game is most intriguing.			"

								Fun game, everything is still being worked on but one of the best prospects I've seen in a while. $40 price tag on steam or $35 at the devs website, I know it seems high to some people but I've spent more on less to be honest most of us gamers have. The combat seems alot like Mortal Online except the hit detection and character movement is much better. It feels like a polished version of MO in alot of ways though the game is in its early alpha. With an inventory system like Darkfall, some of the stuff I've read makes it sound like seiges will be an event similiar to Darkfall (This guess comes from reading the skills under Piety).  Would I recommend buying this game? If you have rent payed with the rest of your bills, Absolutly! I see no reason not to drop a couple bucks on an eager developer, with a great concept, and a good start.			"

												This game has a really cool and in-depth crafting system. However, you should be prepared for a mild grind if you are crafting and a pretty heavy grind if you are building large structures. Also, get some friends to play with you.It's a lot of fun if you have the time to play it.			"

								Life is feudal is a very hard game getting into, sure there are some minor issues as it is just an alpha still but they dont hide it.This game shows you that you really need to work together or you will have to struggle to survive. You spawn naked confused and without any tools. Sure you get some commentary rags but well pretty much you are ♥♥♥♥ed. Think like you would be a prisoner and left at the beach of a uninhabitated island or stranded there cause you fell of a ship.The best part about the game is that it is realistic. Sure it is in alpha and there for needs some fixes but mostly it is goodSome other good stuffs are the amount of things you can do to change the world and how it looks. You can break things, build things and simply make it yours. Not to mention the hardship, You spawn with five cookies, in the beginning you think well this is easy I can survive long on this........ sure you can survive a few days on it and in my opinion too long. But once you are out of them and starving, crawling on all fours trying to find something eatable in the grass it is suddenly not so easy anymore. ALSO NO LEVELS ONLY SKILLS! The bads stuff then, claims! Sure you dont want anyone messing with you castle while you are away as it takes a lot of ♥♥♥♥ing time building it. But I am not talking about those claims, I am talking about claims on logs and smaller items. Try building something when you got to wait 2 minutes after someone brought you the log as it is not yours. This slow down the working speed. Also there is no option to turn off the claims as it would be nice having one for when you host a serverapart from that it is just stuff that can be cause of the alpha. The skill trees are weird and almost random what you need to do something, The are hard to understand and well once you do they are just so simple. You dont have sub catagories or much selection of them, it would be nice seeing a bigger skill tree with a more logical design. Cause building a wooden shack is not under carpentry which is like ehm okay, But instead it is in the tree that builds stuff out of clay and bricks. Which makes little sense, Their wiki is also kind of hard to use as it speaks off ideas of the game not the actual game also lacking in contextOver all it is a good game just remember it is in Alpha and not a easy game to get into			"

								I have approximatley 30 hours of actual gameplay, and I love this game! Its a great sandbox/terraform game. It has an awesome military mix in with it.Pros-You can make the game more difficult or easier based on the skill leveling multiplier. You can also change how fast things grow, smelt etc. The terrain when terraforming has a great reaction based on a more real life scale. The weapons and armors are a harder thing to make so it takes a lot of time for a group of people to turn in to pvp maniacs.Cons- The BIGGEST con right now is the launcher. It needs a lot of work. If I leave a server or want to change characters I actually consider not playing, because the launcher is incredibly slow and there are times it doesn't want to cooperate at all. I also have had a hard time hosting a server. There are some small bugs related to it being a new game, i.e. some terrain issues where you can see through the map or trees look like they hover.Conclusion- I would give this game in total a 6.8/10. For a BRAND new game I would give it a 8.8/10. The game has GREAT potential! I would highly recommend giving it a try, right now I think its worth the $40 and with the reaction we have seen fromt he developers I think in a couple months it would be worth more!			"

								This game is everything I wanted in a Medieval game. The creativity it allows is amazing, It truly is a sandbox inwhich anything is possible. This is very early days for this game and so it has its bugs and issues but that was expected. The game itself plays well and looks reasonable. You begin with absolutely nothing except the clothes on your back and you have to start from scratch to make a name for yourself. It gives you no hints and just throws you out there to work it out on your own which I feel is great. Everything is done logically so you just have to think what you would need to do IRL and it is likely how you do it in game.Words cannot describe how happy I am that this game is being developed and I have high hopes for its future. Definetly worth the buy.			"

								So far, so awesome.I went out on a limb getting this game and do not regret it at all. It's as if minecraft and Skyrim were mushed in to one incredible sandbox experience. I could take quite a while extolling the virtues of the game but I'll break it down to pro's vs cons. Pros:-Totally sandbox. You can do practically anything given the proper skills. -No ""levelling"" in the traditional sense. Your skills accrue as you use them, just like Elder Scrolls or Mount and Blade.-(opinion) Mounta and blade style combat system. If you don't know what I'm talking about, check it out, it's really cool.-Friendly community. With few exceptions I have not seen nor experienced greifing by other players, and everybody if pretty helpful when possible (not any ""experienced"" players yet, since the game is in development still)-The crafting and building system is very intuitive, but there are some guidelines built in so you know what you need to get to make stuff.-There's a huge variety of things to do and make in the game, despite it being in early stages, you won't get bored.Con's-The server screen is fairly buggy, and takes a while to get situated, so be patient with it. -It can be hard on graphics, but with a game like this that is par for the course.-(this can go the other way for some) The learning curve can get pretty crazy, and there aren't many guides out there. But doesn't that just make getting things right more rewarding? Once you get the hang of things it will go much more smoothly-Fairly regular crashes. Just today I had three crashes and a few server time-outs, that's going to happen a bit as many servers are privately run. Of course, my internet is not the most stable, either. -No single player. This game is larger than one person is supposed to deal with, anyway. If you want to be on your own, you're gonna have some problems. but you can try if you want. Overall, this game has 10/10 potential but currently rests around an 8.If you're feeling adventurous and want to be part of something new and exciting, get this game.			"

								I've tried a lot of survival games. So many that I hesitate to buy them when they come out. Nether was a terrible mistake, and I paid 40 for it as well. I was telling my friend about it and he bought it for me. Bad♥♥♥♥♥ I logged on and it was hard getting in the server, but what drew me right away was the music, very Celtic like, I like that a lot. So learning how to craft is hard, and trying to figure out the mechanics of the game was hard. But once I learned how to play, I was immediately hooked. This game is AWESOME. There is no zone in and get shot like in games like Rust, where the call of duty crowd come in and make it a shoot on sight game. I had people helping me, working together, making new friends right away. Because the crafting isn't ""instant"" like in a lot of these crafting games. You have to put work in. When I leveled my ground and built my first shack...it is amazing. There is so much more you can accomplish. I'm still living in the stone age right now, moving toward getting iron. This is worth every cent you pay. If you like crafting, open world sandbox, making new friends....and eventually enemies that have what you want you will love this game. Patience though is needed, I don't feel like this is a ""casual game"". You have to dedicate some time to build up. Join a community or go at it alone it is your decision.			"

								medival survival game ( realistic! ) thats total hardcore in it base ... the graphics are not the world best.. but there are more than ok .. you over see the graphical quality realy fast when you get into the game ...at this early stage the game isent easy with you .. no form of telling you how and what to do ... some bugs here and there .. but nothing major i have discoverd yet ( tho my friends complain over usb audio devices wont work for them .. i have a g930 wireless headset that works perfect )  but its early access so be prepared for BUGS  =) This game is quite hard to learn .. its already a big puzzel on  finding out why you cant do this or this .. the game lacks good feedback .. lacks aym anny way of telling you how it works ( you should watch youtube videos to learn the basics of the game !!!) therefor this game is as hard to learn as eve online is ... but it has hardcore gaming mecanics like eve too....first of is it worth the mony? it realy depents on the developer .. well he complete his game? ( have seen many project stop latly after a short while ) will they improve on how things work and maybe change some gaming mekanics here and there to make the game easyer?will they expand content? fix console commands and so on ?(for admins and gms)if the awnser is eas to most of my question ... then yes its worth every penny you pay.let me start off with .. survival gamesa are quite in atm .. most of them have zombies and monsters that fight you almost nonstop .. this game says ♥♥♥♥ that ... lets make a realistic survival game ... and thats good .( ofcourse you need to like this type of a game) the game evolves around players on the enviroment. you make your own story .. faction? and so on you say what happens. it takes a♥♥♥♥♥♥amount of time to even build your first house ..  the look of like its now you use at least a year befor you have a castle ... the skill system is realy good and simple .. tho as mentiont the crafting system is hard to understand from one time to a nother becouse of the lac of feedback and information ( som minor bugs don make it easyer ) i love tho how you can play together and build .. work as a team and so on ..so i recoment this game if you like medival faction coop based( there is no faction system in the game... so this is kind of role play !) dont care about fancy graphics , fancy voxel system like minecraft and so on .. the game has is own quality the way id does stuff =) build an empire out of dirt  =)			"

I sincerely hope that that is does, it could be the midieval space engineers. This game is like Mount and Blade combind with Minecraft, and I mean that in the best way.  It is very realistic and it is extremely well balanced. it encourages teamwork in a way I've never seen in another game and the social dynamics it creates is much different than games like dayz because of it. I would totally reccomend this game. It is the best midieval sim a fan of the genre can ever hope for. ""My Favorite Game 2014 Hands Down"" - Iivaitte			"

												It truly is a mix between TES, M&B and Minecraft. You find yourself in a medieval sandbox world with a heavy amount of possibilities. There are some nice ideas behind the game and if it gets to the MMO status where it wants to get.. it could get a true success game which came ""out of nowhere"".+ Proven skillsystem+ Good combatsystem+ Interesting ideas+ Realistic craftingpossibilites+ Medieval feeling+ People aren't always playing deathmatch, in general there is a good community- Complicated game controls/mechanics- A wolf is capable of taking 3 players out together without a problem (balance problems)- this game can't be played alone because there is 0% fun in this way, even with 25 players (11 guys in my group) I found myself being bored and without motivation to continueEdit in Sept 2015:Many things happened. Devs did a good work and implemented many things and mechanims and it makes fun to come back a year later!Edit November 2016:Editing this again.. after coming back yet another year the game somewhat lacks of ""wow effects""... but looking at the hours I've spend in this game its ok this way. Waiting for MMO and maybe a comeback.			"

								good game all in all, it would be nice if they had a tutorial to make it easier for first timers instead of needing to go and watch youtube videos but it is still in alpha so there is alot of time to add plenty of items/options to the game. I would recommend if you like a good challenge, i think this game is going to go far once they tweek it, and make smoother game play.			"

								To survive in medieval is it easy or difficult? You need to find Raw materials and hunt to survive. This game is amazing even in early alpha, you can dig mines, build houses and make knight armor to survive. You can do it alone all the others. Build your kingdom, be good or evil of your choice. I recommend this play even if you seem the price is high. Rust, 7 Days to Die and Main Craft in one game, but with more excitement and fun. Buy and support the developer. SHOULD BE EXPERIENCED!			"

								Damn... This is a role playing paradise. I've sunken thirty hours into this game and I already have the reputation of Okravaaz Draaf the revolutionist. Wow... Off to the review :D!====================================================================================Gameplay: The gameplay is not molded by the developers but rather the community. My most memorable moments were of course not staring at a green bar, but they were about meeting new people and speaking to old friends. I even started a revolution against the almighty leader of the server. That was fun. (4/4)Graphics: The game doesn't look very pleasing, but it isn't terrible either. (2/4)Preformance: The game preforms almost horrible. I guess it is playable, but it certaintly isn't pleasing on the eyes. (1/4)Realism: The description of this game basicaly sums it up. The most god damn realistic mmo I have ever seen. While its graphics may not be good and it may not preform great, the game is so realistic I think I've been blinded. The game basicaly reflects on what it would ACTUALY be like in the wilderness. I would say you would need the help of five or ten people just to get new CLOTHING. (4/4)    This game scored a total of 55%. I know you think that's a terrible score, because it is, but the only real downsides to this are its graphics and preformance. So as long as you have relatively strong eyes and a decent computer, you should be able to enjoy this game.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NOTES*The game is relatively slow moving, and you're going to want a day or two of free time to actualy enjoy the game.-SharkTurd, C.E.O.

Early Access Review
								Badass game. If you're looking for an open world survival MMO, this is it. This is my first experience on a new server with everything brand new. You start off this game with basically a handful of cookies. Your first job, build a tool. So you walk over to a tree, snap off a twig. Alright now I got my base, let's find a rock and some string to put this thing together. Gather stone from a stone surface randomly on the ground and make some twine from grass. Sweet got my axe crafted. Eventually I get all my tools and started looking for a couple of people to group with. All the reviews said there were friendly people and to my surprise, there were♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of them. I play a lot of Rust so I'm use to the Kill on sight attitude, but I felt guilty trying to smack someone with my axe and they couldn't even techically fight. Without a tool you have nothing, you can't even punch. I don't know if that will be fixed, but I like it. There is never a reason to kill one unless you're an♥♥♥♥♥ really. So I tagged up with that guy and we got a campfire going. Started talking to people in global to see who had a base. Turns out no one really even had a settlement, we were in the very beginning of the game. So we sent out the word where we were and people started flooding into our group. We had a couple lumberjacks cutting down trees, two guys fishing for food, another two looking for berrys and gubs, and a handful of guys up the the mountain mining some ore. Then we started to build up a town. Eventually I had to log out, but it was pretty awesome that we all came together to get a base going. We heard of other big settlements popping up on the other end of the island. Already we were planning war.  8/10. I would say 10/10, but plenty of bugs still. It is early access so I'm sure my score will change.			"

												I had my best sandbox experience inside of this game. It's level development system encourages survival and cooperation whilst it's survival aspects challenges the player to do their best. The player works hard for every inch of progress and the game will keep the player coming back. Just turn on some Celtic music, I recommend this one.			"

								After a short while in-game, I learned one thing.  Progression takes a looooong time.  There seems to be a decent amount of potential in this game.  It is, of course in very early alpha, but once they iron out some stuff, even the later alphas will be a good amount of fun.  If you like survival games and have a group to play with, pick it up.  If single-player is your thing, don't bother.			"

Early Access Review
								Very promising - There is a surprising amount of content to explore given that this is an early access game. PROS:- Many of the complex systems are already in place (such as terraforming, construction, logging, etc.) which is good as this is a crafting game at  heart. - The huge crafting and skill systems require specialization as you have a finite number of skill points to allocate (on most servers). - This is great for encouraging player interaction and community building. The idea of having a town blacksmith that you need to go to for swords and armor, a logger to cut your trees, etc. is a lot of fun and not something a lot of games like to encourage. You're not a god, you can't do everything on your own.CONS:- Combat is promising and deep but not very satisfying at the moment.- Long server load times (seriously, be patient).- The engine needs optimization. This isn't up to the Life is Feudal dev team but it does affect their game.- Occasional bugs and some people experience frequent crashing.CONCLUSION:If the dev team can continue building on what they have without falling into the typical early access pitfalls then this game will be the next big thing. All it will need is a promotion from a YouTuber to blow up. "

								Early Access Alpha, People, ALPHA!I love this game, I've been looking for an off-line Wurm for some time, and this doesn't disappoint. I host my own server, just for me, with x2 skill gain and am really enjoying building up my little 'community' bit by bit, a potters house, a miners house, a farmers house, a ranchers house, and so on.It is an early access game, in Alpha - that is it is un-optimised (optimisation would ideally be finished in beta stress testing), it is not full of content yet (there is content but it's more to test the mechanics) and even not all the mechanics are in game yet (an alpha should start with the core mechanics, test them through content, then add more content/mechanics, test those, and so forst). If this is not the sort of game you want to play, with possible roll-backs, world-breaking bugs, crashes - then don't buy this game. Certainly don't buy it, then whinge about the state of it - the fact that it is Alpha is smeared everywhere! If you want to play the game, but not in the alpha state, then buy the game to support the developers to finish it then go away for a year!			"

								Best Game i played for months if not years, and this in early Beta. Love it to bits, beware there still lots of bugs and the game still far from ready but worth the investment. And you get your hours out of this game, and value for the money. As i known period reenactors i known the time and effort that the makers put into thsi game, and its nowhere a clone of any game out there. The crafting system still needs tons of work but you never get bored make a sword after al the effort blood sweat and tears you put into it. Now just need a head to bash it against. It gets a Rangers 7/10 for early release ... but a 9/10 for the gameplay and general idea of the game.			"

								Honestly, despite its hourly server crashes, or client crashes causing me inconvenience, and memory leaks, I am liking the base game for what it is. It to me right now is a building/farming/crafting sandbox type of game which I've never played which is why I find it so appealing. Lots to do, great to meet people and form a community, and there's always that looming PvP threat on servers to keep you from becoming complacent. Highly addictive, enjoying the slow pace compared to that of other games I normally play.			"

								Imagine Wurm Online (or Haven & Hearth) with a working and modern interface, combined with Mount & Blade style combat and Ultima Online's skill system. That is essentially what this game is.This is a stand-alone alpha version of Life is Feudal, and is *not* the MMO that is planned to come out sometime next year, though buying this means you will have a free copy of the MMO when it does come out. What this means is that you are limited to 64 player privately hosted servers and a 1 km square island instead of 10,000 players on a 32 km square continent, and that none of the guild territory control stuff is activated.That said, it's still a blast, and is worth your time and money.

								I have played just over 10 hours of this game and from what i have gathered i find this a very enjoyable game.So i will start with the settings for the sanbox mode.The setting can change from how many animals spawn,the time smelting/logs you need to use to smelt Iron Copper Gold or Silver.There are also time set on how long trees grow and many more it is a bit weird to use when you jump in but is quick to work out.The User-Interface is very hard to understand but i have figured out the basics to what most do.You have the stamina bar which is the green bar,The purple bar which im am pretty sure is the health bar and a small bar that is your hunger bar.hunger is a task in its self to do. You can search the floor for food and eat what you can find but if you dont want to do that you can go the farming root and make carrots onions wheat and more.I have made my character more of a miner so i have not did much in farming.but the small part i took in was very easiy to understand. Construction is very easy to do collet a certain amount of items and build with the tools you need.I will state that this game if played with the standerd settings will take you around 5-6 hours just to build your first house.When you figure things out the game is much simpler and faster.I could go on for hours about this game but what i will leave here is my final score.I give this game a  8.5/10  -ArranGaming "

If you think you're going to jump right in and start cutting heads off with massive armor and swords... Think again (I did not come into thinking it was going to be like that), but with how in depth the crafting system is you will be playing this for hours maybe even days!			"

								For being in alpha this game is highly enjoyable and little to no crashes. The server selection system needs some work, but its not to bad to find the same server. A none console based direct connect to lan servers would be nice along with steam network support so joining friends would be easy. This games to me is a mix of Wurm Online for the crafting and Mount and Blade for the combat. Can't wait for more polished features and more content not that there's not a lot to do, i just look forward to even more. If you are looking for a realistic, medievil sandbox rpg this game Rocks! Only feature I haven't played with much is the PVP comabt system as everyone on the server I play on keeps to them selves.			"

								Lots to do, but a 'building' game. More focused on the community and working together (or against one another) than an FPS. There's a LOT of content here, for the patient person who wants a challenge. This is early access alpha, so I'm excited to see what they come up with next... can't wait!There are a few glitches here and there, but it already feels like a 'complete' experience. Feudal life is simulated to a great degree, so be prepared to run for your life!			"

								I've logged some time both in multiplayer and single player and I've definitely had some fun with this. I personally love the sandbox high-realism gameplay and the slow pacing of everything makes the game a real marathon to achieve what you want, but it's extremely fun to see all the progress you've made as you build your first shack and then an actual home and tools.This game, like most in this style, really depends on outside sources to learn the mechanics. I spent hours trying to flatten terrain for a house only to realise that I didn't understand how the flatten action worked. Prospecting for minerals makes my brain hurt, and tracking confused the heck out of me for quite awhile, but once you know the rules, it's all accessible.			"

								With only 46 hours total, i'll give a review of what i think so far. This game is outstanding, with only a plaster shack build and a kiln to keep me company, i'm completely subdued in the environment. The mechanics of the game are good for it's state, the animal AI is good and the crafting is brilliant.More on the crafting. The mining aspect of the game is realistic, not Minecraft like where you can dig a mineshaft 300 blocks long in the space of half an hour, in this it would take you weeks. Hell it would take you months. The Buildings are realistic to every detail, they also take much longer compared to other crafting/building MMOs. I cant realy comment on the PvP as i've only fought a tree with an axe so far. The skills are in-depth and have a promising future.All in all. If you are a hardcore survivalist that loves PvP, survival and building. This game is the one. "

								THis is that game you've always dreamt of yet always been dissapointed when others have tried to create. the world is extensive, complex and dangerous yet the KOS culture of Rust has been avoided and instead teamwork is the neccessity as things take time and particulary focuses to accomplish anything of import. Of course there is always the fighting for those that are interested and that keeps it from being just another sandbox game where you hit one thing and put it down some where else.Already those of us who have played this are craving the MMO and would love to see even a sketchy version come out so that we could comprehend the awsomeness. Keep up the good work devs, the constant updates and quick response times make you guys a rare group!Best game Ever!!			"

												This game is in not ready for release. There is a lot of work to be done to make the servers stable. Immense amounts of bugs and crashing. Once this is all cleaned up then I would recommend purchasing the game. Also a day one 40% sale is a slap in the face to all the EA supporters. Especially since the company confirmed we will all receive 1 character slot of the MMO version of the game rather than just the people who purchase LIF:YO in early access.Update 1/19/2016: I have changed my review to positive simply because no matter the bugs that can be irritating and the instability of the servers. The developers are continously working harder to address the issues and the game itself is amazing. Very immersive game with most servers having a nice balance of RP and PVP.			"

Early Access Review
								Yes it is early access, but advertisement and and screenshots make this game look alot more developed than it really is.  After purchase you find the graphic quality and overall smoothness is horrible, and it takes a huge toll on your computers performance even at low graphic settings..., and the overall direction of going about game life is confusing and tedious.  At the games current state, it is almost pointless to play due to servers going up and down on a constant basis, so you lose all of your production on a daily basis and have to start over.  For the hefty price tag, and mis-leading state of the game, I currently cannot recommend this game to my fellow steam-mates.Edit:After a few months I decided to give Life is Feudal a try again to see if any improvments have been made.  And to my surprise this was in fact the case.  The game runs very smooth now even with the graphics quality turned up to max.  I have enjoyed playing the last few days and frankly have become somewhat addicted to its game play.  I think it would do some good if they implimented a better beginers tutorial though, as it get can confusing on how and what to start doing, but with thier online wiki things are manage-able and can be figured out.  Find a good server to play on and you may find yourself having some fun.  At this time I will be changing my rating to positive.			"

												I really enjoyed the pace of Life is Feudal. This game makes you feel accomplished for everything you build. Just leveling the ground takes hours, and gathering materials makes the game feel genuine. Me and 3 of my friends spent 80+ hours making our small out of the way village.  Hauling lumber up to our encampment was an all day task. One friend collected ore, and another smithed it. While me and my other friend leveled ground, and built structures. Our base was finally coming together and then it happened...the server we were on got restarted because only like 5-10 people were coming on anymore. We haven't played together since. The biggest issue I had when I played was that when the new day started the whole server would lag for a minute.			"

								!!!I do not recommend and I don't say don't buy it! It's up to you, maybe you will enjoy it.Did you play Mortal Online, The Forest, Rust? This is the same kind of product. Great on paper, not so great in reality. It never will be so polished like it should be. From what I did see right now, you can't even delete unused ingame items (thats very stupid). Also the cells system which is used for the land (you terafforming single cells) doesn't seems  like good sollution. It's not working on 100% and that cube mining holes looks really ugly.There is single map for this first small realease and even this one single small map has lot of holes in textures. Realy its one small map, can't they put some love into it and give us world without possiblity to see beneath textures?? Shame on you devs! I did see ther only two animals, wolf and some deer and they alwasy stay on one place, side by side like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Thas all what they do. Yeah, maybe wolf will attack if you want kiss his beloved deer, I did't try, because I saw video where two guys vere killing one deer like 30 mins. There are spots where the same sounds of wildernes are repeated every one second. So its for example never ending loop of eagle scream. It will force you to move from your already claimed property to somewhere else. If those guys have technical skills like for example Trion or Funcom, that woudl be awesome, but what I did see right now, it's just another cheap looking, like hell bugging, forever in beta never really polished game. But part of pvp crowd would be satisfied for sure.And about ""early access and beta"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. In todays language, that means realeased, money making game. So spare it for someone who cares.. When MO was in beta, people were excited like hell, is the same with this game. But I think this will do probably better then Mortal Online, it looks little bit better.I don't want refund, it was my decision to buy, am not in hate. I will check the huge map when they will release it. But am realy sad that it is always like this :( I would  say, that all these junior developers just use us like university of game making. They probably will one day join some real company and would do some reall games.			"

My only gamebreaking issue right now is that the preformance on it for my rig is heavier than Battlefield 3, or any CryEngine game. My assumption for this is that it's being ran through Torque, and it doesn't have a lot of optimization.If you have a rig that can run Battlefield 3, around medium to low graphics, then you'll probably have issues with this game.Gameplay is great, preformance is not so great (on my end). When this game get's optimized and I can play it without any tree lag, I'll write a more thurough review.			"

								This game at current (Sep 3) is very playable and lots of fun. However, some of the tasks do feel very repetitive and grindish. But this is a very good game still. If you find it too grindish, you just find a new server to play on.  Figuring out how to do things and progress isn't too hard and most people are willing to help you along. There's not too much of the kill on sight people and if you find that and don't like it, agian, find a new server. I found that at some points the game flattens out and there isn't too much else that can be done. Though there are many hours of playing to get there. All in all, this is a great game for those who like realisim and town building. PvP isn't too big, yet, but it likely will get there. Worth the money now though!			"

This is indeed your second life!as the achievement said.I only played this game for a couple days as I have many games to play. But it is essentially Beautiful I love the quality and the feel you get to it, more of the gameplay is you need to get item B to get to item A.FULL COOPERATION NEEDED. You cant be Jack of All Trades in this game, you need friends. You just need them, You cant build a village alone neither can you craft all items alone, I recommend 3 friends. You being skilled in A the others in B and C. If you want you can run around and search for people to work for. Realism in this game is 8/10 many skills when I first play is useless but i think more updates and content will come. The Hours you need to complete a house, the help, and people needed! Its not like Minecraft or other survival game, you cant finish it under 10 hours you need like a full day even with friends for just a few items.Buy it? Yes. But needs help on the first few days "

								Reasons why you should buy this gameIf the idea of building and fighting to survive in a cruel unforgiving world populated by people who want murder you and steal your flux to finish their warehouse appeals to you then this is probably the game for you. Your story will most likely go as follows. You start as a confused peasant and spend the first day playing the mud. Slowly you learn about the world and eventually you craft primative stone age tools to aid your struggle. After much patience you learn how to build a shelter to shield you from the cold and even learn the secrets to smelting and while using your neighbor's forge while they aren't looking, the art of crafting. Finally after what seems like an eternity you finally have iron tools after which a naked man appears with a stick and promptly beats the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you, taking that shiny new iron hammer and shovel just in spite of you. Doubling back you will forge new tools - weapons. With your humble pitchfork in hand you go to the forest in search of bandits. Unfortunately, you find them. They laugh at you and watch as their buddy beats your♥♥♥♥♥once more with a stick as you haven't the slightest clue how to fight. The next day in exploration you come across a great stone castle populated by several intimidating warriors. You ask to be let in as a laborer and they accept. After days of working on their stone keep they offer to teach you to fight. With stick in hand they kick your♥♥♥♥♥over and over again until the secrets of combat begin to unfold. Eventually you are able to hold your own though you are clearly still an inexperienced fighter. The next day you and your companions go together into the woods in search of adventure. After hours of exploration you come across a populated camp in a clearing. You recognize their faces of the occupants and rush out of the clearing ready to fight. You knew exactly which weapon you would use - the one that had caused you so much pain in the past. Your friends quickly follow eager not to miss out on the fight and the bandits scatter in all directions once they become aware of the unfavorable odds. You give chase and corner one deep in the woods. He quickly pulls out a familiar pitchfork in to defend himself with. Stick in hand you fight him. Although you were once terrified of him you now realize that his experience at hunting mud farmers hasn't taught him to fight. For every hit he makes on you, your weapon lands five on him. He panics and attempts to flee but your last hit staggered him. The following hit ends him. You stand victorious. The circle is complete and now you are the one beating people's asses with a stick.Reasons why you shouldn't buy this gameI would not buy this game expecting it to fund the plan of the MMO as while it is an epic idea, I do not think that it is a realistic goal for this dev team at the present. From an outside look anyone can see that development is moving sluggishly for a game that is in early access. I get the feeling that a few of their programmers are a little green as I have seen them do stuff like use reserve words as variable names and set the default render range to a rediculous amount causing the entire map to be rendered reducing frame rates of even good computers below 30 (Thankfully has been fixed with a simple edit of a text file). Also for the longest time you could crash the server on command by inviting someone to your group who wasn't in the game. If this team with their present proficiency tried release this as an early access MMO the servers would be empty in weeks from technical deficiencies alone as this team has not demonstrated an ability to swiftly address critical issues like a certain well known crash-the-server-on-command bug(See below).As time goes on I hope the team improves from experience (doesn't always happen) and expands to include more experienced members. Then and only then will the idea of a MMO be a realistic oneDo not buy this game expecting to get a finished product. This game has a long way to go so don't buy it expecting to get a mostly finished game. This game has MAJOR problems. For instance, once every month or so servers have to wipe because the world doesn't repair damage done to it by players. Buildings like that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mud hut you made do not decay over time even when unused for weeks. Also every single mine on the map remains there until the server is wiped with no way to remove them. Both of these cumulatively cause server lag and the eventual reset of the server causing you to lose dozens of man-hours of work. The game is also troll infested as is any sandbox game with things like spawn camping and glitching over walls and into houses (to steal valuables) both being common place. Also don't be suprised if you log in and find that someone made a bunch of unremovable mine tunnels in your base right where you planned to put that keep. There are good servers out there that are good at policing such behavior but it's up to you to find them.			"

								Life is Feudal: Your Own is well done game, despite the bugs and lack of optimization. Yeah there's bugs here and there like freezing in place and not being able to move (well at least for me) and that the game takes a large amount of RAM. But those are minor in just how in depth and amazing this game is, and it's only in Early Access! Life is Feudal is a medieval sandbox game that likes to be like DayZ, but it does it so much better. Instead of mindlessly killing people (where you lose alignment and lose more skill points upon death), the game tries a more peaceful approach with the implementation of a yield command that gives all your stuff to the combatant, but you get to live on. This would be more like the Codes of Chivalry in being that you protect the honor of another knight. I love that this game does things so well and I cannot wait to see what it's like in the full release, which is by no means close to even being finished.  All in All, this game does an excellent job, despite the problems it has.			"

								Life is Feudal... Life is Short, especially in the medieval times. Also in modern times too. Currently, as I am writing this I have about 8 hours logged. About Two of those eight hours are actually playing time.Rant aside, this game has super potential, and yes, I know, its in Alpha.What I will add to give the review some diffrence to other reviews is --Mentioning that whenever you play on a diffrent server you have to restart. From scratch. (Try and stay on the same server)-There is NO offline mode (the Mines of Moria have better internet than myself) so you can play without server crashing then re-logging and losing another half hour of your life)-Primitive weapons are useless. I used my primitive axe  (Made from a snapped tree branch, some plant fiber from the ground and a piece of flint picked up from a rocky patch)  to attack a Wild Grouse, as my charecter was on the verge of starvation  (I had eaten all 5 of my free cookies, and apples only add 5 to your hunger bar, and the ground roots, once you find them, your pretty much back to the hunger you started on)  So, axe in hand, i approached from behind, axed raise expecting a kill... WHAM!... it survived. And fluttered off and nestled a few yards away. It carried on squaking. I ran up again after letting it settle in.. Whack!! It ran again. Two hits with an axe and it still lives? Hopefully theres no Dragons here. As it took 15 hits to eventually slay the mighty Grouse of Fedual times. Each hit registering 1.5 damage - 2.5 for a head shot.Finally i skin my pray. Collect the one feather from it. Carry it to my nearby camp fire like its some heavy tree trunk. But wait.. i cant do anything with this object. WHY??? IM STARVING HERE!!! Are my skills to low? What have I done wrong??So i give up and gather more apples. Make a fishing rod.. and try to catch fish on an empty stomach. Where are the fish??? I fished for ten minuits... not a bite. More apples. Apples... Their driving me mad!!! Then.. You cant find any apple trees.. or have over harvested them.. So you revert to a dirt digger, looking for roots to eat. Its a negative frustrating cycle. Somewhat feudal.-When you meet someone new, they're likely new to the game too. They boast how they have made a primitive axe also. You made one half an hour ago. and thier bragging makes you want to show them your own axe up close to their face. Yet, you are a good patient person and give them a simple ""well done"" keeping your penalty bar neutral. (Penalty bar is a bar which kinda measures your deeds. Basically if it goes into the minus side, you will be a criminal and if you die, when you respawn itll make you loose more skill points than normal, so if you pray everyday, and be ""Nice"" youll be in the positive. Or stuck on neutral.) - Your new fround companions decide to build next to the large lake on the big island, or on the coast... you start logging trees. Not quiet sure what to do next.. plus you need to work on your construction skill, as you cna only build a furnace.. A furnace??? What use is that..??!! But wait, you gotta learn to walk before you can run. So to build a furnace, i need to collect water and clay and sticks... ok. I can find every thing, but cant pick up water?? ( I actually logged into another server and found a massive village - with no inhabitants. But there was a well. It would let me collect water and it had a container allready) so how do i get water??As you can see, this game frustrates, soome times makes no sense. The wiki for the game isnt the best. You watch online you-tube videos and most people who make them, you can hear the frustration in their voice aswell. But then again, thats part of the feudal life. You want to tame the wild beast. Make it your own.Id give this 6/10. I would love to see a single player version with NPC's, raids by NPC etc. Or at least with an allready established town, where you can go up to established carpenter workshops and ask for work etc.Anyway, ill still keep logging in, wasting my time looking at ""Conecting to server & Loading World"" screens, just to see if there is progress because like I said earlier the potential... its amense. (Even though that can be said about a lot of alphas/betas) So stay tuned folks.			"

								If you are looking for a hardcore medieval experience...this is it! I spent at least 4 Hours in the game before I was even able to build my first Shack...Terraforming, Gathering Materials. etc. takes a really long time if you are playing on your own, but I wanted to learn the basics of LiF first before I join any servers. Once you've built your own Shack then you can craft furniture to fill it with, which of course requires new Materials and Tools. So, even though this is a early Alpha you will always  have stuff to do because everything takes so much time (like I said, this game is Hardcore!). With better Carpentery and Logging skills you will be able to make better and bigger Houses and Buildings which will even take more of your free-time :D I only played the game for like 12-13 hours at this moment where I'm writing this review, but I'm already addicted. So If you like Medieval themed games and are looking for a Minecraft-like experience you should give LiF:Your Own a try!			"

								Well what can you say about a medieval sandbox game? For starters you have to take in mind that it's still just an alpha but after seeing past the rough edges you can see that this really got potential.I would say that this is some combination between Minecraft and Mount n Blade. This game really puts its weight on teamwork between players, this by complementing each other to cover all the different skillsets in the game.As I said before, this game really got potential and I really recommend you to try this out.

								I'm giving some faith to the devs for my recommended status. It's a beautiful game, but after 9 hours I'm bored. Crafting system is in depth but the controls... THE CONTROLS! Want to build something? Don't look to anything in game to guide you through even the most simplistic of tasks. I chose the private server route as I wanted to see what the game has to offer without having to watch my back. That was fun to set up, you will need additional downloads if you run into the non responsive (private) server. I think 8 of my 9 hours I spent hacking away at trees, watching a crafting bar run it's meandering course, and alt-tabbing to try and find a user made youtube video while I ground my teeth in frustration. I wanted to do something that looks really cool in game and having no clue how to even start. I should add that I only knew something cool was there because of said walkthroughs.  The desolation was incredible as well, I felt like I should have run accross a few peasants on the road to harass, maybe a highway robber, but alas nothing was there to even make me worry about obtaining a decent weapon. I even cranked up the animal population to max and it took me a half hour (real time) to wander my lonely island till I found what appeared to be a deer and wolf grunting in the bushes doing god knows what. 4 slingshot projectiles later (after firing 20 shots at close range) I watched my preys back side dissapear into the woods, I gave chase but tripped on the wolf and was promptly devoured as I tried to switch my weapons (STUPID G DAM ANIMATION) because the sling takes one weapon slot and the shots sit in the other.Pros: Sweet idea, excellent presentation, the game of my dreams. Controls are responsive.Cons: Nothing to do, and the things you can do are too complicated and not really a big payoff after grinding for hours. Controls are confusing. The Island is disturbing and lonely in it's beauty. I'd rather be a part of a continent cut off by a mountain range, that would feel immersive. I could keep going, but this is an ALPHA build and I want to see it make it to completion. My recommendation is to support the Dev, maybe wait for it to go on sale if you can't drop the $40 (really? Why is it so much?) but I would at some point pick up this game because it looks like good things will be coming.			"

								This has a lot of potential to be a good game if they take it the right direction from where it is now.  Will be a lot of fun and will require team work.  There are a few things that feel much more drawn out than what the need to be though.  Hopefully things like flux and bone glue can somehow become more availible so it doesn't consume so much time in future patches.			"

								Pros:-Looks Good graphically-It doesn't feel like a grind, there is a genuine feeling of getting more and more advanced and accomplishment-The Developers are very active and know what they are doing, and w/ enough, no, PLENTY of staff members-Community is good (For the most part people are friendly not too much KoS) -In depth crafting, gathering, and interesting hunting system. -It's just fun to play! And you can play in any way you like, for the most partCons:-BUGS!!! (for the most part its in your favor like a bear won't attack you back and you basically get free thick leather instead of a face full of claw, but other bugs can be frustrating like tracks not showing under hilly terrain)-Optimization issues (for the most part people can run the game w/ decent pc's like for instance i'm on a laptop and run the game well on medium graphics! but it is early so every now and then it can be unplayable for some people but the devs DO fix the bugs, the problem is that when theres 1 new content patch theres probably a need for 2 new optimization patches, but the devs do well with keeping up with things, just saying if you don't have the patience to wait, do not spend ur money for the next few months) ALSO SERVERS optimizations. This is the big issue esentially the more buildings, mines, and tree stumps that acquire on a server, the closer and closer it comes to its impending doom and the server needs a wipe, which is a tad bit too short imho.-Some key content not in yet, like horses, and ♥♥♥♥ING BLOCKING, as a veterened M+B player I was dissapointed to find out blocking was not working whatsover with the exeption of (maybe) shields. -The mmo version is not even close to here yet. The MMO version is what the devs really want, and wether you know it or not its what YOU should/do want. HOWEVER if you buy the game now you get free acess to the mmo also sooo its not that much of a downside.TL;DR Its a fun game, if you have the passion and patience for the game and its genre buy it, otherwise come back later!

								Life is Feudal: Your Own is definitely a product of our ongoing craze and love for the survival, sandboxy, constructive and destructive genre, while taking another step towards its logical extremes. The game is a beautiful one, the graphics and the lighting do not fail to impress, which helps bring life to a vast world filled with trees, mountains, swamps, beaches and the ocean itself. Although at the time of writing the game is clearly an Early Access one with plenty of missing features, what's there is evidently plenty to hook people in.The game gives you plenty of options on how you'd like to play it. You can set how fast or how slow your skills level up, from a glacial crawl to rocketing into masteries. You can set skill caps, either letting the player master every profession, or give them just enough to master one and dabble in one or two others. The latter adds an incredible amount of flavour, where you see farmers who are actual farmers, carpenters who are actual carpenters. They've specialized, they've mastered their trade, and although they may have the ability to help out here and there, they'll never become the town's second blacksmith. To some this may sound bad, but look at it this way: this is Life is Feudal. You're building a town, and in this town everyone, every player, has a purpose. They become gears in a grander machine, where everyone relies on everyone else.In that kind of game, on that kind of server, you won't find that one guy that's a master blacksmith, carpenter, architect, herbalist, and so on. You won't find a massive castle built by a single person, vast and full of every imaginable thing, but equally lonely. During my play I was invited to join a town. A small one, admittedly, but immediately the community became evident and clear. You had farmers with their plots outside the walls. You had the blacksmith with his shop, a herbalist with another. I was lucky enough to be apprenticed as a carpenter, witnessing wood cutters at work, hauling timber to their newest farmhouse.That doesn't mean it has to be though. If you're the kind of person that prefers the Minecraft approach, worry not! As I mentioned before, the skill rates are completely up to you. If you want to master the art of logging from peeling the bark off a tree, you can set those settings up and just jump in. You'll be able to master every skill and build your own little kingdom. This goes in multiplayer as well, meaning you can have a small group on a high skill rate server that'll be able to rival a low skill rate server's larger community.Nothing is perfect however, and this goes doubly for early access. I don't fault the game for any of its bugs or glitches, but it helps that I honestly didn't run into many. The only thing that actually showed up was that sometimes items wouldn't load in and I had to restart the game. No crashes, no memory leaks, no massive frame drops out of nowhere. The frame rate, admittedly, was pretty awful even on the lowest settings, but that's par for the course during early development. It can only get better. Yet this doesn't leave me with a lot of complaints! The UI is a little clunky, but that tends to be cleaned up during development. Wolves are a bit deadly when you're starting off as well, making running into one early on a deadly affair -- and honestly, that's about it.There's already a good selection of servers out there with a modest but dedicated population, too. For anyone who's been seeking a game like this, I find it easy to recommend. Just be warned; this may be a little too hardcore for a jump directly from Minecraft, at least for some players. For the rest, that's most definitely a good thing!			"

Wolves are a bit deadly when you're starting off as well, making running into one early on a deadly affair -- and honestly, that's about it.There's already a good selection of servers out there with a modest but dedicated population, too. For anyone who's been seeking a game like this, I find it easy to recommend. Just be warned; this may be a little too hardcore for a jump directly from Minecraft, at least for some players. For the rest, that's most definitely a good thing!			"

								I love this game. It is very deep from skill set point. You should try to play with group of friends - makes things easier and gives better sense of being part of a feudal village / keep. Loads of potential. Great fun.			"

								Alot of reviews will say this is a tedious game of loading bars, in some sense it is. but it works, it is the most fun you can have watching loading bars, the absolute need to work together in this game is what makes it so fun. combat is decent right now, and for an early access game has tons of content to offer. i spent 60 dollars on games to get 15-30 hours out of them, i have a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton more than that in this game and still have barely gotten past being a ""Noob""			"

												This game has had alot of ups and downs it takes a lot of time to play if you have time on your hands and afew friends to play this game you have hours and hours of fun. when i bought this game it was alot more broken and  glitch ridden then it is now the devs worked there asses of to get the game where it is now, it is a great game to rp in with alot of stuff to learn you get to be anything your town needs ever wanted to be a blacksmith this game alows you to do that. but with all of its hours of fun there are still problems with this game the pvp has so many broken weapon that a naked guy that been on the server for a hour can kill a person that has full armor and has played for a month on the same server i would recomend staying away from the pvp and stick to the rp unless the server admins have a battle arena for pvp that they can make it alittle more fair, the other bad thing about this game is that the dev have started on the mmo which they said they were going to do from day one this game is a base for there mmo a practice run if you will they warned everyone who bought it if they cared to listen so the developement of this game is slow so the pvp bug and other bugs may take some time to get fixed if they even do before the mmo comes out. That all being said i would recommend this game over and over again and i have to many of my friends. if you want to play this game think it looks cool buy it while its on sale even though i believe it is worth the asking money it being on sale makes it well worth the money and a no brainer you arnt just supporting this game you are also supporting the mmo that they are makeing based on this game so get in there on a fresh wiped server learn the game get ready for war, and remember the name says it all Life is feudal..

												I am obsessed with this game. Normally i get bored easily and will buy a game, play it for 30-50 hours and then move on to the next thing. Not this one. I have put 100 hours into it so far over the past 3 weeks and am more obsessed than ever. I am constantly surprised i still love this game since it seems very grindy, but the strange thing is that i rarely notice the grind when i actually play. Even the seemingly grindy tasks like flattening the earth or fishing for food don't seem to be as tedious because you are constantly thinking about what you will be able to do next once you complete that task. Things to be prepared for/know up front:--This game is not quick. You will not build everything in the game in a matter of days. Even seemingly simple things such build a small wodden house will take 30-40 man hours (longer if you have to do everything yourself). If the thought of always having something new to build or something to improve appeals to you, then you will like this game.--This game should not be played alone in my opinion. I don't mean you have to start the game with a friend, but you better find someone else in game (or more than one person preferably) if you want to have any success. Everything just takes too darn long and never ending if you aren't able to divide up tasks.--Many servers are heavy RP so if that's not your cup of tea, make sure to find a server that isn't.Recommendations for enjoying the game: --Research the available servers thoroughly and pick one you think you might like. Nothing ruins this game quicker than joining a dead server or a server that enforces rules that will ruin your fun (like deleting your character if you die)--If you are first starting, run around the whole map visiting the towns. Dont just join the first one you see. You will be spending a lot of time with these people so you have to determine what their goals/time commitments/ etc are. I played on 2 servers and the enjoyment i had on one is immensely more simply cuz that one contained people more willing to help, and more people on at the same time i would play. --Do not play alone. I have already said this, but i cant stress it enough. This game becomes 100x more fun if you are working on something with a group of people and can pass the time chatting with them rather than working by your lonesome in total silence.Conclusion:This game deserves more credit than it seems to get, but in the end it all comes down to the server you join. Join a good server and you will love it. join a bad server, and you will play this for 10 hours and never come back.			"

												Great game if you have friends irl to play with, otherwise its pretty boring, hard and practically impossible to get moving in the crafting aspect of the game. And I say irl friends as those made online can easily just ditch you and leave you stranded with no way to keep going on your own. So make sure you know the people you play with well.Otherwise, good game. Mechanics are hard to understand at times, but with a bit of practice its fairly easy.			"

												Very addictive and really interresting, this game should not be released yet. For the people that do enjoy this genre of games it is brilliant. More Alpha then release it does feel like you are a labrat for the upcoming MMO. Devs are still releasing content which is buggy but with quick hotfixes (sometimes less quick) it is enjoyable and one of the few games that let you build a base the size of a city. Pick a server that fits your style and you are up for some good hours of lacking sleep and painful fingers from grinding materials.			"

Early Access Review
								If you're like me, you're going to love this game. It's like Harvest Moon for grownups - you fish, mine, forage, chop down trees, build a home and farm. It's definitely grindy, and of course as early access there's a lot that either isn't implemented or doesn't work or is just a bit weird. I was surprised by how playable it was, though, and by how addicted I came to it: just gotta log on and tend to my flax plantation, check on those hides I have curing, make sure the livestock has food and isn't drowning in poop (this does tend to become an issue if you don't keep on top of it).If you're like my brother you'll be bored, especially with the current state of the game - it is repetitive, not especially dramatic or exciting, and jumping off the mountain doesn't kill you. You have to learn a chain of skills before you can do a lot of things - such as mining before you can actually smelt ore - and some of it can take quite a while. It also requires a degree of teamwork if you want to progress at anything other than a snail's pace. All in all I sincerely hope the development continues and the game does get a full, stable release - it's always a risk to buy something like this but I personally don't regret the purchase.			"

Early Access Review
								To some of the other reviews, which I feel have been unfair in some respects:The game can be grindy, yes... But it does not take 30 real-life hours to build a shack.All you need is skill in terraforming and construction (which are in the same line and unlocked almost instantly) and some primitive tools. If you know what you're doing (and it takes no time at all to know, if you youtube it), you can get a 3x4 plot of land flattened and build a shack in an hour, if even that.Unless you're building on an extreme incline like a mountain side - which will of course be tons of work.The game is kind of lame for a solo person unless you love to basically do nothing but build and survive - but that's not the true aim of the game, from what Iv'e seen and experienced. You can be a lone wolf, yes, but on a server with a decent population it is often much easier to go it in a group.The point of the game is to build a town/kingdom that is populated by real people that are ready to defend it, and real people that are ready to raid and conquer it. Teamwork is the key here, especially on servers that set the skill cap lower than maximum.If you want a solo experience, you should go for a ""themepark"" MMO or a casual single-player voxel game such as Minecraft.This game - a full-loot, free pvp crafting game with hunger mechanics, complex stats and a no-target combat system, is *not* a casual single-player experience. Don't fool yourself.Would I enjoy more agressive NPC's that would give a real need to build defenses? Absolutely. But this is just not that kind of game, and there is honestly little need for it outside of a private, single-person server.Between honorless theives, merciless raiders that want nothing more than to make you bleed and take your land and crafted items, and the ever-present possibility of betrayal from your own neighbors... This game utilizes the same hostile threat that so many others capitalize on - the most powerful, cunning, monstrous and challenging enemies of them all; other people.   And that is more than enough reason to build tall walls and secure storage buildings.If you absolutely cannot wait for the MMO, buy the ""Your Own"" version now and get in a good server with decent admins. But be prepared for spurts of lag on higher populated and more developed servers, until they fix tree growth rates and tunnel lag. This current version is more of an isolated testing version in a smaller continent with smaller public and private servers, in which many people and guilds are using for training purposes to prepare for the release of the much larger MMO version.But all in all, I reccomend this game for its unique and satisfying experience. Think ""Wurm Online"" with much more fun and heart-pounding combat, and way better graphics.			"

												Having just played the game for 70 odd hours I have found it tedious at times but other time have though ""this is the greatest game I have ever played""..This game excels if you team up with others as solo = long boring grinds at times. If you share the load then you can focus on the more interesting parts. Once you get over the initial skill development the grind becomes enjoyable. It is very rewarding to see you castle develop or defeating others in battle and this game really shines in the team work department.It still has bugs and the menu screens really need to be improved but I am looking forward to the MMO version to see this game really shine.If you are looking for a solo experience then I would look elsewhere as it will take to long to get your character to a enjoyable stage..If you want to have a social game where tram work is pivotal then you will like this game, especially after getting some of your skills up..

												I recommend this game for people that love crafting and building stuff.Do not expect combat in the first few days at least and this is a slow pace game.You may be overwhelmed at first, but extremely good once you get the hang of it.Pros:Let's say this is a crafter paradise game.It is a real sandbox experience, based on real life.The depth of the crafting is so good, I've never played a game with that amount of details.This game takes a long time for all the little things, it is breathing. (I guess this can be a cons for some)Graphics are pretty good realistic style.No hand holding, learn on your own. (or use the Wiki :P)You'll get the MMO version once released.Lots of details into the world, animal are breeding, trees need to be replanted...etc.Sounds are perfect.Cons:Interface is a bit clunky, but not that bad.Optimisation is rough performance wise, lags and freezes. (that may be the server I'm on tho)Combat seems a bit clunky as well.Some Profession requires other to be unlocked, but sometimes it makes no sens. (ex. you craft a bow but cannot use it, unless you learn how to use leather armor first.)Animals pathing is very bad.			"

It is quite in-depth and a good alternative to Wum Online if you don't like monthly fees or slave labor for benefactors. Do significant research before buying though, it is not a game for everyone... not even really a game for many. Also, if you plan on playing with the default rules come to grips with the fact that you will have to lose levels in some skills in order to gain more levels in a skill that you need. You may even need to re-level up a skill which you sacrificed levels in hours earlier. This is becaus there is a maximum number of levels that can be distributed to all of your skills and the level of your skill determines what actions you can take. This creates a web of skills which makes it difficult to survive alone. For instance: if you are trying to cook you need a pot. To make a pot you have to be level 60 in terraforming. To get the logs for the fire you have to be level ~60 in logging. Only then can you start to cook and level up your chef skills. But now you have taken up 120 of your ~640 total skill levels just to begin cooking and there are SO many more skills that you are likely interested in. My suggestion is to do one or both of two things: Make sure you have other players who are dedicated to the game and will play with you. They can keep skills up which you will totally ignore and do all of that kind of work for you and you can do the same for them. This emulates real life which I believe was the intention of the developers. OR you can play in a world where the total skill cap is higher. I wouldn't make it a ton higher because that would make the game more about grinding to max level and becoming a god instead of intelligently mastering your skills and developing a lifestyle. Overrall a fun game, you should just really know what you are getting into before you buy it.			"

								Well i was very optimistic about buying this game after looking at the OS needed to run it, (i use vista 32bit) after some research i could not find anything positive to help me figure out if any vista users other than 64 bit users got it running, as i'm somewhat of a problem solver and have a reconfigured vista os anyway i thought ""What the hell"", i'll get it anyway and figure someway to make it run if i hit that wall.Worked first time, no problems, and with only a 9600gt powering the graphics, all i had to do was tone down the resolution, and that fixed the fps drop, so i have all objects of every kind at max ..including grass, and can still play it perfectly even though its not yet optimized, The games a definite buy, especialy for those who like rp/crafting/building ... oh wait ..... TERRAFORMING! yup all lands can be raised and lowered, plowed and fertilized, pathed and stoned, got to go .. got a farm to build .....			"

								For starters, this game IS very good and very complex, but is nothing like you see in the pictures or videos...To get a building, let alone making clothes will take for ever, especially 'good' weapons, too.As you can see, I have spent a nice amount of time int he game, and yes I do like it, but I play with 2 other friends, and we still havent even got the point of being able to make buildings and stuff, we're as far as making a furnace, and it is very hard to find the 'fuel' to light it up... Not sure if it will be usefull anyway.Also, all 3 of us teamed up on a SINGLE wolf, each of us armed with basic weapons. I was the only survivor, and we didn't even kill it.*SUMMARY*This game is good, and will be awsome when it's released, but you need the patients to build and do stuff in the game, which sadly takes a long time.

												Well firstly this is my first game reveiw and i am only doing one because of the unjust review from people who have very little gameplay to write a ballance review for this game .True it take a lot of time to get anywhere and you have to do the team thing if you dont want to put in hours of work to get the place of your dreams but thats the amazing thing that keeps you hooked . The other thing I like about it because it takes so long to get anywhere you dont get the kiddy script game wreckers playing it. I have to say its one of the most polished indie games that was a early access game i have ever played with devs keeping up with regular updates and patches. So all said and done its a 10/10 for me and buy it and make your own mind up			"

												Great game, horribly optimized, most reviews seem to be by people with little patience. Many reviews complain about immersion, even though this is a simulator. A Simulator. Simulator. Sim-u-la-tor. The combat system needs vast improvement, as do animals. Tons of friendly servers, I have no idea what those other plebs are talking about. The grind is painful if you don't socialize or join a group. A lot of people seem to forget you can always go on your own after you team up with someone.This review section makes me want to drink bleach for days.			"

								This game is exactly what I have been looking for. Two things to make it absolutly perfect: Be able to control your own AI people (limited number of course, 1 or 2) and to be able to leave your server up so your friends can do stuff in it while you are gone ( I don't know if this is possible or not, I just know it would be great). This game is so addicting. There is a lot of watching tutorials and youtube videos, but the game is completely worth it. Completely. Best money I have ever spent on a game.			"

								Life is Feudal! This is the game of my dreams. Freedom to build, explore, craft, and work as a co-operative team in any way you wish.  It's really important to note that this is not a solo player game. I shudder to think of how long it would take to do anything by yourself, but it's got really great potential for co-operative play. Unfortunately, I've not had the experience of playing with others..my PC doesn't run the game well so I need it on a lower res, which pushes the chat UI off screen so I can only play with people I have on teamspeak or mumble. If you don't have a graphics card, I don't recommend this to you unless you can deal with really bad graphics, or are going to get a graphics card soon.Negatives of this game that I struggle to overcome...it takes forever to do stuff. There's a lot of grinding for skills, and the time it takes to do certain things, or for crops/trees to grow don't always make sense. It takes half the time to erect a house as it does to uproot a tree stump. Fishing takes 30 seconds and you almost never catch anything. I guess this is stuff that will be ironed out in future updates, but if you can't deal with strange logics and bugs and unfinishedness then I wouldn't recommend this to you.Positives...if you DO have a graphics card this game is gorgeous. Watching the sun go down over the lakes and mountains really is something to see. It's immersive, and exciting to see your settlement develop. If you have a big bunch of friends, or friendly people on a server you frequent, it'll be great for you. You can get stuff done fast and I imagine it feels a lot more fulfilling than slogging over your tunnel for 4 hours with one other person.In conclusion....it's a lot of money for an alpha but if you have the money to spare (and excessive amounts of time) then I'd definitely recommend it to you. It has a huge amount of potential for the future, which is really exciting! "

What it lacks for in graphical fidelity and sometimes performance issues, it makes up for it with just the sheer amount of content available to those who are currently playing the alpha and I think anyone who loves the medieval era and wants to have an amazing experience with a game that mixes both Mount and Blade and Rust together will be in for a treat.

								Great game going so far. Devs seem to actually care about player input and respond to players on the forums, They are currently focusing on major issues right now before the small tweaks, but that is ok. I only have a cpl of gripes. 1. crashes, this can be any number of reasons and its still EA so I dont expect a crash free game but it could be less often2. FPS drop near forest and player built places. 3. In order to use mail armor you need war horse handeling, (which is not implemented yet from what I can tell) Overall the game is worth the price, but beware, it is VERY advisable to get a group of people as it is tedious on your own.

								Im gonna make this a simple review and basically list pros and cons for players. and also pros and cons for GM.check out my server realitivly new its called: ~Heaven or Hell 24/7 New 11/17 NoWipe | Vilayer.com[This is a Grinding game] player pros and cons: Pros-1. early alpha so more stuff will continue to be added.2. good selection of armor and weapons to create 3. multiple buildings and houses to build4. pvp combat against other players.5. buying the lif: YO will give you access to the LIF:MMO of 1 charector key6. the devs fixed alot of FPS problems and crashes in the last patch [thank god]7. great patches and updates. the rate of patches coming out is about 1 a month on average.the list for pros seems short but there is more in this alpha to keep you plenty busy and playing for hours and hours with out wanting to stop.Cons-1. early alpha so patches leads to flaws but the devs are quick to patch and respond2. not all clothing items are possible to make due to some animals not yet being implemented into the game.3. alot more weapons and armor choices would be nice people like options when it comes to apperal and weapons.4. only one race so everyone spawns as a bald white man, it would be nice to see other races and female charectors. 5. no mouse sensitivity in the control settings. [this needs to be added please]6. no horses which they will be here soon but need to be made more of a priority.7. bows and xbows are broken and need major adjustment8. wolf is extremly over powered. i understand its the only aggresive animal but it should be not as strong.9. no bridges/drop down bridges or anyway to make a moat [ not a priority just hope to see]10. in game voice chat starts turned off and you have to go into audio settings and turn it on. (fix this)[these player cons are seen more to me as the major priority items that need to be worked on.]Onto the GM i will only be listing cons since all the other GM abilities are fine in my opinion:cons-1. GM needs a faster terraforming tool. [make it use the same size grid as the observe mode on terraforming but have a way to increase or decrease all of the squares at once]2. a GM should not be able to ban another GM. you removed the ban hammer from a GM from banning themselves but you should also remove the ban hammer on anyother GM logged in.3. when logged into GM all skills should be unlocked aswell as anything to build or use.4. GM shouldnt need tools to forge or anything else (you have it this way for terraforming and building but not forging)5. GM or server owner should be able to set a higher player stat max than 150/150the gm powers overall are great how they are these are just a few i think would be nice to have.Things with the map that i beleive need to be improved/added:1. something more than apple trees for food at first. something like bushes with berries, or vines with grapes on them.[basically a slightly easier or more realistic way to find food and survive at first]2. more animals. i know this is coming but it should be a high priority item.3. the map should be atleast double the size it is now. with servers having a population cap of 64 the map is too small simple as that.using a simple rating system with 10 being the best i will rate the game below-overall gameplay 9/10combat gameplay 7/10 (needs work)crafting and creating 10/10 (some of the best ive seen)survival gameplay 7/10 (needs more aggresive wildlife and a water meter to go with the food meter)weather 2/10 (would like to see changes such as rain, snow and day/night cycling needs work)graphics 7/10 (could use overall more detail and design to most items other than that pretty good)map 7/10 (nothing special but it is a nice terrain)This is a great game and i would recommend to anyone who enjoys mmorpg games. with the pvp and soon to be better pve this game gives you endless amounts of things to build, create, and do. Cant wait to see this game advance here in the future, as of now i would still say BUY this game because if your interested in the Lif:YO your going to want to play the MMO and buying this will get you 1 charector key for free for the MMO version. excellent developers working on this game with there great communication to the community and there hard work this will be an excellent finished product in the end and is a sure buy that you wont regret. [IF YOU DO NOT LIKE GRINDING GAMES THIS WILL NOT BE FOR YOU] Thank you for reading my review. (sorry for any incorrect grammer or incorrect spelling.) "

								This game is perfect for my taste with just a few small things I dislike.The crafting system is epic and so interwoven that you need to work with other players to be able to build and craft. I really like it.The combat is really fun although it needs some polishing and reworking of the combat skill trees (that's what an alpha is for, I know) and I can't say I've had this much fun in a game since I played mount and blade for the first time.The few bad things:It's not hard to survive, food is plentifull even if you've just started and animals are easily killed, even bears.Food doesn't go bad, so gather 10000 apples and you're set for a long while.No environmental effects. Like freezing to death in the cold, damp weather or drowning or fall damage.Overall it's a great game even though it is in alpha. 9/10 as it is.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm writing this review as of 10/12/14, for future reference. I'm assuming/hoping I can post more than one review for the game, because it's currently in Alpha so the game will evolve, as will my opinion.In summary: a lot of awesome concepts with the potential for a very collaborative-feeling multiplayer experience, or a somewhat hardcore, and therefore enjoyably challenging, single-player experience; marred by a terrible UI.Now, the rest. If you're currently thinking of buying the game, here's what (I think) you need to know. Yes, it's $40, and that's kind of pricey for what we've come to expect from an Early Access game. In this case, from what I've played of the game *so far*, and ASSUMING the things I *don't* like are addressed, the finished game should be worth it. I realize that's like saying ""Assuming the chassis of this unbuilt car belongs to a Prius and not a Hummer, the finished vehicle should have great fuel economy"", but...that's my best assessment of the price vs. game quality ratio so far.The game is very detail-oriented, so if you're expecting Minecraft, with ""punch some trees, get wood"", you'll likely be significantly disappointed. Actually, the best analogy I can think of is like a first/third-person version of ""Banished"". To chop down a tree (the first thing you'd probably do in a fresh Minecraft game, to stick with the analogy), here's what you need to do after spawning in LiF: Hit ""tab"" (which takes you out of mousey-menu-y mode, and into regular FPS navigation mode), and find a tree (some trees are hardwoods, some are softwoods, but that doesn't matter for now). Right-click on the tree, mouse over the ""Forestry"" submenu, and choose ""Get a branch"" (you might need to do this a few times, I can't remember how many branches you need for your first basic axe), Now walk around until you find an empty patch of grass (just empty of trees or other objects, really), right-click on it (you may have to move around a little for the game to recognize the patch as being highlighted), mouse over the ""Nature Lore"" submenu, and choose the ""Find wild plant fiber option"". You'll also need to do this a few times, as you need more than one plant fiber (I think) for your axe, and you don't always get it every time. After you've got your plant fiber (5, maybe), find a square of ground that has a rocky-looking texture (i.e. - not ""regular"" grass or ""forest"" grass or ""regular"" dirt or ""plowed"" dirt or...etc.). Right-click on it, mouse over the ""Prospecting"" submenu, choose ""Find a likely flint stone"", and repeat as necessary (like the plant fiber thing) until you have a couple (again, can't remember exactly how many you need). Once you've got a few flint stones, open your inventory with ""I"", right-click on the branch, and choose ""Craft Primitive Tool"". Then from the resulting UI pop-up, click on the craft menu, choose ""Primitive Axe"", and then click ""Craft"". This will take a little while while you flail your hands about wildly in front of you (character animations are a little generic atm), but at the end of it, bam! Now you have a shiny new axe. Open up your character screen with ""T"", and drag the axe from your inventory to one of the four tool/weapon slots on your character. Wait again while you flail your hands around (yes, equipping gear/items takes time). Now that that's done, go back over to your tree, right-click on it, mouse over the ""Logging"" submenu, and choose ""Cut Down"". Congratulations, you've now chopped down your first tree. In Minecraft, you'd already have a dirt hut, furnace, crafting table, and complete set of stone tools built by now.This is not to say that LiF's system is *bad*, just that it is incredibly detailed. Captive animals age (and die), fires burn out very quickly (no ever-burning torches), and trees take an unbelievably long time to grow after you plant an appropriate seedling. Again, NOT Minecraft. For me, I do not have a problem with that at all, it just may not be everyone's cup of tea.Unfortunately, what I do not like is the game's atrocious UI, which feels unintuitive, awkward, and unresponsive. More than once you'll find yourself in ""mouse-around-menus"" mode when you actually wanted to be in ""regular FPS mode"", because you were put into that mode because a message popped up letting you know a (possibly inaccurate) error occurred when you tried to do something. If your inventory is full, it will still attempt an action unnecessarily and then inform you that the action failed because your inventory was full, wasting some number of seconds (which do add up) unnecessarily. It will also attempt to craft things one extra time more than is possible, for example if you have the materials to make two of something, it will go through the crafting process three times and then inform you that you didn't have enough materials to make the item the third time.Depending on how much the UI stuff bothers you, you may or may not enjoy the overall Alpha experience. For me, there are a few times where the UI is so frustrating that I'll just have to stop and go play a different game for a while until I am less angry at it, but a lot of the time, the rest of the game is fun enough that I can let it slide.

												I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves a good survival game, the gameplay, the scenery and graphs are awesome, still a bit jenky at times but it more than makes up for that the rest of the time, definately a coop game as levelling and skills do actually require time to accomplish. its taken 50+ hours for myself and one other to get enough skill to craft an actual house and smith armour and weapons. i purely deal with nature like animals/hunting/herbs/trees and construction and my mate deals with horsetraining/smithing/tailoring/mining and terroforming.we need others to join our small RP server purely to help build our community and work together to survive, message myself or NemisisNytHawk to join our server!!!!!!

												Great game and definitely a grind so do not purchase if you cannot understand that!  You have options to be a one-man show or go with a community (highly-recommended).  GM's could use some rules themselves but for the most part it is good.  Community based and newbie help is always available to those who join throughout all the servers I played on.  You start with rags for clothing and can build an empire.  Crafting is very indepth and while it is a lot of work it is very rewarding when you need good armor and food.  Brewing and cooking are fun with great perks for eating high quality dishes.  Buy the game now for practice before the MMO that will be masterful!			"

								I really like the game and am addicted to it but i see a few problems:1) when clicking on water a red dot comes up, i don't know if it is meand to be there but it seems out of place2) when an animal dies in water you can't access its resources3) i recently made a heavy crossbow after spending 3 hours making 1 linen rope and not knowing i needed 2. i tried to craft it but it didn't work but the bad thing is, it took my rope for nothing.4) when the pic is mining, some of the noises are out of time.5) sometimes after sawing a log, the noises continue for ever.6) there is rarely, but sometimes, a weird long shadow either side of the player that follows him.7) `search for herbs' action repeats over and over again after you find them8) under `sow' there is an alchemist's outfit labeled as alchemist's TOOLKIT and it is confusing me9) Just before writing this, I tried to make a BAG, made it and got a SACK!!! it really confused me, but thanks for the free upgrade!!!

												The game is awesome, the only problem I encountered was the starting game because it was difficult to learn everything. I would recommend a playthrough tutorial rather than a text based tutorial where you have to read what you have to do. Plus the hands on tutorial will fit in more with the survival aspect of the game. Also make the early game a little bit more simple and as the game progresses, make it more complex and difficult so the game stays a challange, but is easy to pick up at first. Overall awesome game.			"

								Recommended buy if you like to work really hard to accomplish a task. Don't buy if you are not looking forward to grinding. The game is one huge grind fest.  It is not a game meant to be played by yourself. The idea is to play with others and work with others in order to accomplish something huge. The crafting system so far is excellent. This game gears torwards realism. Things take time. To put things into perspective, lets take farming for example. On default settings, it takes about 6-8 hrs for the crops to be harvestable. The map is not randomly generated. It is however, a really large map. Also, there seems to be a floor level depth that you can mine past. I spent hrs locating a digging to find the iron vein just have it be not minable because of the maximum depth you can mine to. Save yourself time and only mine into hills.			"

								First time I played, I was hooked. Very realistic, brutal, exacting game. For hard core players who want a sense of satisfaction and achievment when they look at their fort and see all their hard work has paid off. However, this game is still in Alpha so very much of it doesnt work and is not implemented. Myself and three other good friends all played while on Skype for a week straight. We built a small keep, which is a monumental task as far as gathering the resources and aquiring the skill to do so. But upon completion of the keep, we found that we couldnt claim it, so the Keep provided no security and we were robbed of all our hard earned resources constantly. We then decided to seek saftey by building large stone walls around our compound, but the gate we built could not be claimed....foiled again. All the while our resources, flax, leather, iron, char coal, weapons, rope and tools were being stolen faster then we could build and/or gather them. So we built a large warehouse. We could claim that...but it got hacked and all the stuff in it was stolen. Our merchant carts kept ...""walking away"" with other noob players helping them.... this game is a fantastic and engaging game. but its unplayable at the moment by hard core players....no one can expect to put any time in it if all their time keeps getting robbed. SO MUCH POTENTIAL THOUGH! Keep your eyes  on this one folks			"

								Well where to start, If you are exspecting the game to be fully functional and not agrivating at times this is not the game for you. After several attempts and different remedies I was finally able to create my own server, though when you close the server down any memory of your charachter is lost and nothing is saved. As far as uniquness goes this game has a whole hell of alot of potential to be a kick♥♥♥♥♥game at a later date, however I will state my opinion that I feel that this will take a year or so. Graphically speaking the game requires more than the recomended specifications to play, keep in mind running your own server and the game itself will consume most basic computers physical memory and im sure with tweaks here and there they will render the graphics preformance a bit. Gameplay wise its fun when you start for about an hour or so, then you realize it now has become a farmfest which is ok because it gives you the feeling that you are living in the past. But when you adventure out even the smallest of creatures in this case a wolf have a decent health pool that basic tools and weapons are no match for. Once you die you are given a spawn timer if you can not be healed to good health or you simply respawn with a minor skill redux, also take in mind when you die your charachter will drop all of your gear leaving you with the choice to restart or endure the run back to your corpse for loot. The sandbox feel is emmersive and the music is not half bad but unless you have a groups of freinds to play with and acheive something the game will leave you feeling lonely being the only one or two on the island. Overall if you have the money to support these guys I would highly recommend it especially concidering the recent popularity of the game.			"

Some people should just learn to read it clearly states  ""Note: This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further. If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development."" I am glad that i bought this game and plan on playing many more hours.-pro's you cant play 5 minutes and have everything in the gameteamwork is a must as there are many things usefull in the game that you cannot do all by yourself-cons not much content as of now but it still has plenty to keep you busy for monthsone map (hopefully they add more maps/allow people to create custom maps)			"

								Where do I begin? This game is so ambitious, so complex that it's almost mindboggling. And yet, it's extremely addictive. The potential of this game is staggering. Deep crafting (and by deep I mean very very deep), and the building is very satisfying. There are a lot of youtube videos covering the various aspects of this game, so I won't go in to too much detail. I'll just say this; If you're into open world sandbox games with immensely deep crafting and building systems then look no further! This is the game for you. Highly recommended, even in alpha state. There are of course some bugs, but the game is overall in good shape. I see some people complain about the price, but for me this is a must-buy. Worth every penny.See you in game!			"

								FINALLY! A game that I have been dreaming of for years! Like Wurm Online, but done right to the point where it's enjoyable, not like a 2nd job.  Even more fun when grouping with friends and working together to build and fight along side one another. The game is still in development and use being used to help develope their MMO version of the game later down the road.  There will be bugs, so do not expect it to be polished, but oh man is it a load of fun and great as it is at this moment.			"

								This game really knows what it needs in order to be fun. Even in the early alpha I find myself enjoying the time I spend in-game because the developers made wise decisions about what to focus on first.Also the terraforming in this game is second to none. I've never seen tile based terraforming done this well in any other title. It's both simple and powerful.			"

												I just started playing again, I will write more about the game in the future.Combat is FIXED! You can block and its even more awesome than warband, its physics based and direction based! have to test archery and mounted combat too.Beats all MMOs even though it's just Alpha.The game reminds me of Star Wars Galaxies, you actually interact with people, talk to them on TS which imo is a major aspect which makes up an MMO (massively multiplayer..)The game beats minecraft in complexity, coming updates will probably allow complete house design too.No more stupid questing or ""you have to raid here every day and pay 15 $ to be decent"", you are the content, your friends are the content, your achievments are not ""kill 10 rats and return"", your achievements are villages, objects, social interactions and wars and diplomacy.The skill tree is diverse, you are not forced to do only one thing, you can do what you want, be what you want, support the team how you want and be a success your way.Fighting will when it's fixed be fast paced and skill based like in warband.I would support this Game, there have been enough trash mmos run by big companies sucking your money straight out of your pockets for nothing.What the game lacks in Alpha state: Server stability, some bugs, things are not implemented yet but updates come every 3 days...Also, the game is very time consuming, I would not recommend to play alone, you will be frustrated quickly if your house you took a day to build get's raided as soon as wars will start, allthough so far people avoid wars unlike DayZ or Rust.

								So...I also almost did not buy this game. I'll admit, this is a somewhat pricey Early Access game...but it is totally worth it. I think the devs have an excellent vision, and with the direction they're moving in, this game only gets more and more promising. I've logged nearly 200 hours in only a few weeks, and it's been nothing but a blast. Since I've been here in the few weeks I've had it, there have been two patches already, fixing little tweaks and bugs as we go. We're getting updated graphics and UI soon enough, and I can't wait to see how the game runs then.TR;DR Version:Get this game if you like RP driven sandboxes, and find a good community. (RolePlay Community Life is Feudal is awesome!) This game is totally worth the money, and if you can get it on sale, grab a two pack and play with friends. And DON'T go to a stupid server with 3000 available skill points. You're doing it wrong.			"

								Possibly one of the best games ever made if you put the time in. I love it.It does take quite a bit of time to make progress, but once you make it, it's so fun.Building up your town with a band of friends all specialising in different skills makes you depend on them,one man can not make a city on his own. Incredible building, terraforming, and crafting.I love how you actually have to pick up the logs and THEN saw them, things like that is what makes this game what it is. 9/10 in my books! It does take quite a while to get things done. "

								As with any game played in it's alpha form, Life is Feudal: Your own! has a few kinks to work out. The crafting system is rather genius and the over all ability to do as you please during game play shows how much you will be getting in this game and their future game Life is Feudal: MMO. As to the kinks I mentioned before, the servers tend to lock up often and puts a damper on the fun one would have. The idea of making this game completely community based is the greatest Idea I have ever heard, but what if you wanted to play by yourself or with only a few friends, this makes community play less then desireable. The requirements to run the game are rather high, understandable so, and that makes it hard for some of the monatery impaired able to play with current systems. The RPG you can do with friends makes this game worth the minor bugs and glitches, I did fall through the earth and drown once. The Tunneling system should be improved. Allow for tunnel collapse if possible, or be able to just fill in unwanted tunnels.Over all I see great promise in this game and look forward on the edge of my seat for the MMO to come out. With it's great new ideas and it's overall style of play I give Life is Feudal: Your Own! A 9.5 out of 10. And recommend it to all who enjoy RPG and building games.			"

												I've been playing this game since the release of the alpha version. While the dx9 alpha version certainly had its bugs, it was actually playable. I love the game and want it to work. Love the concept and it has a lot of potential. That being said, please wait a few patches as the full dx11 release currently is LOADED with bugs and I cannot recommend the game. Gameplay, Day1 release... 


YouTube™ Video: Life is Feudal  Your Own Release Day1 

			Views: 2,082		

			Worst full release of a game ever. This was a clean install. I uninstalled the alpha version, deleted LiF folder from Steam directory, and reinstalled the full release for clean install.		

EDIT: Less than a day after the release a hotfix was out and fixed all major bugs. The game is now running great and looks utterly amazing! I highly recommend the game now. It is definitely not a game for people who like simple and easy games. It can take a very long time to craft even the simplest of items. It can be a difficult and tedious game so for anyone who likes easy-mode games, stay away.The physics-based combat system is amazing. You really have to learn the range of your weapons. Being too close will do little to no damage.The crafting and building in this game is very in depth; Better than any building/crafting game I've played by far. Again, it may not be suitable for those who want eveything handed to them quickly and easily.This is a game definitely designed for co-op play. Playing solo is possible, but it will be a long hard road for you. Much better and easier with a group of friends. 9/10			"

												Sandbox games are my genre of choice and LiF:YO is one of my favorites.  While I do recommend this game understand that I do so with this advice:1)  Worth it if $20 USD or less.  It is still being developed.  The MMO is still in beta.  There is not enough content for most people that I would recommend the game if it was more expensive.2)  This is a slow, involved game.  By slow I mean that it will take several RL days to build most structures and some you will almost have to have help if you want to complete it.  And it is very involved.  Down to crops you grow, animals you raise, what industry you want to focus on (mining, carpentry, building, weaving, farming, etc), what weapon(s) you like to fight with - the game has depth.  At times, especially if you are playing solo, many of these things can become tedious tasks to take care of (such as cleaning the coop so animals don't die in their own feces) before you move on to things you want to do. 3)  Watch youtube gameplay videos (look for more current ones).  I can talk about the gameplay, slowness, combat, and other aspects but the videos will do a far better job showing.  I have had this game for a long time now and it is one of the better early access investments I've made.  The dev team is still plugging away at it, working on the MMO portion, supporting the player community, and trying changes to improve the game.  While the game will continue being tweaked and worked for months (years?) to come, it is very playable and can be quite enjoyable.			"

To start I want to say that I honestly feel that this is a good game and that people should buy it to support it.Firstly the concept is amazing, an mmo set in medieval times where there are no pre-made buildings and no NPC enemy's, just you and the players with you, stuck on mammoth sized island thats covered in a forest filled thick with trees and a bounty of food. Now i will admit it, from the getgo this game is hard as hell, you'll spened hours doing things that range from chopping a mount everest amount of trees down to running arfter a boar with a makeshift knife, but it's really all in an attempt to make you feel that you are the person in the game, that you are this person stuck on an island in a medieval time period, where there are no complex tool and where a task (e.g. building a house) is somthing that takes days to do and stack load of skills to be already known. Now this is where I'll give you a tip, it is imperative that you play this game with other people, I'm not say that you need to get your friends to buy a copy because there are tons of people on servers to makes friends with, but you need someone else with you if you're ever going to get past having a stick hut and stone tools, and here's why. This game has a incredibly complex skill system, but to put it short every skill is esential for your survival, however there is the option that you can ""Master"" a skill such as smithing or alchemy and this has huge positive effect like allowing you to make new and special items, that in most cases will be rare because you'll have been the only person on a server to have spent time mastering that skill (Making you unique, somthing not many MMO games do). However doing so will decrease the amount of skill points you can use and as a result lower the amount of other skills you can have, this is why having a community or even just 2 or 3 friends is so important in this game, because you all need to devote yourself's and stick to a different skill in order for yourself and your friends to progress to something like a huge settlement, instead of you being by yourself spending hours apon hours and getting no were becuse playing that way was only ever surposed to get you so far in this game.Secondly it's absolutly beautiful, this game has some of the best graphics that any game which has come from early access on steam has ever had, the water looks stunning and the forests actually look like forests, by which I mean there is more than just two grass and two tree models and that if you were to enter one you'd be waist high in grass completely covered in shadow by the thick conopy of the oak trees that suround you. Now the forests actually have alot more detail in them than I just described such as mushrooms, fungi on the trees and also a variation in plant type such as flowers and wild crops, all these things actually come together to make an incredibly immersive expirence in the forest and make you feel like you really could be in an norwegian forest. Now other than the enviroment the buildings in this game are so life like and historically accurate, the stone walls and gates have moss covering the lower part of the model, the stone chipped and rough and the wallway's looking warn from guards walking up and down them, the houses with thier walls made from daub (which is a matterial made form basically anything on the ground that they could throw together), have mud and marks on them and even the balconys have flora draping down them, this is all rendered beautifully in the games engine. However this is where the visuals become a hardware problem, if you're not running a rig with at least a high end i5 processor, 8GB of ram and a Navidia GeForce 970 with 4GB of memory or equivalent, you're only ever going to see the game in below high graphic settings and if you have ever seen the game in Low settings you'll know that it is truly unplayable. Of course the devs are trying to fix this by lowering the tessellation calculations of the trees and other models within the game, which may or may not increase your graphic settings from Low to Medium but even then the game is still not worth visually playing for many reasons. But of course if you're not in it for the beautiful scenic forests in full detail with bambi running by perfectly rendered in 4k and you're running a rig below the minimum standard, then you're nothingly like me and you should have no problem at all playing this game in Medium settings.To conclude, this game can immerse you into a fully realistic feeling medieval setting, where surviving is hard and cruel but can be mastered by you and your friends if you band together. It contains an immense amount content such as the skill system and can entertain for hundreds of hours, but dosen't just have to be about resource gathering if you don't want it to be (e.g. Banditry, RolePlaying, Becoming a role in a community). Apart from this the game is pleasing to the eye and make you really feel medieval while you run through it's player made city's and castles, looking at the beautiful detail that has been put into every aspect of it. But to sum all these point up I do recommend that people buy this game only if they enjoy this type of genre and also only if they can fully explore it's visuals with the appropriate hardware on hand, don't be disappointed if the visual aren't up to scratch because you can't run High settings, that's also your fault not just the developers.

Anyway if you want to enjoy this game with friends, you could create your own server with password. Soo that's great! :) This game is really good and I recommend this game. Life is feudal. :)			"

												Dont even bother till the MMO is released, unless you want to buy the game and rent it from some power abusing, donation hustling admin that password the server during judgement hour so that only those who gifted them with funds can play in their bought out Fortresses and cities, dont support crap like that, if the games on special id recommend purchasing it and waiting till the MMO so if something is amiss you can get a refund... dont bother with the YO aspect, every server I have been on has Admin abuse, they spawn in stuff that would take you months to achieve and make sketchy rules that dont mean a thing when it suits them and besides 64 players on that small map is pointless			"

Heavily sandbox focused: -Respects gameplay realism as much as possible.-Player tools.-Diversity.Game just keeps on improving while still adding meaningful and complex player content like heraldry or weather / seasons.

								About 2 hours in, and I can say that I'm really enjoying the game. The occasional audio glitch or clipping error is, in the early stages of the game, a nuisance, but it's to be expected. It doesn't really take away from the in depth crafting or skill system, which, while tedious, is very rewarding.The visuals are what you'd expect, but running it on a slightly lower-end PC I can't really judge them fairly. In my opinion, the crafting, skill trees, and building system are what make this game unique.Would recommend / 10			"

								taking into regards that this is an early alpha this is a good game. the crafting and skill system is extremely diverse and as far as i can tell everything is projected accuratly for the midevil era.the downside is mainly numerous bugs, but that is to be expected in an early alpha game. there is also no way to adjust the 'fullness' gained by food, resulting in a constant near starvation state in singleplayer which was the main turnoff for me.

Also it was unclear as to how many skill / attribute points I was allowed to allocate. But those are minor ""complaints"".

												Based on only a few evenings of playing Life is Feudal: Your Own, or LisF, I can start to see where it shines over similar games that I would prefer, but more importantly where it does not. For a sandbox game with 'realistic' crafting, Wurm Unlimited/Wurm Online have the same 'realistic' appeal but, if you start your attempts to make second-tier tools immediately, it takes days longer to accomplish in LisF. I did not see anything as innovative as 'improvement' on things you create neither, so the 'quality' listed on materials for new players just seem like random nunbers without meaning. Also, you start with nothing, akin to Rust or Ark, but almost anything you want to build you cannot even gather the materials for from right in front of you since you need to be a master in a skill in order to become proficient in another skill and only then does the option to collect some resources appear in a context menu under the right conditions. The graphics are better than some of the sandbox games I still like to play so that's nice, but it's still so much worse than other games with 'some' sandbox building mechanics like Fallout 4. I have only seen it in videos since the servers I've played on were just not that populated, but fighting seems a bit more skill-based than other sandbox games, which is good; however, if you want great skill-based fighting in a sandbox world with 'full loot', the original Darkfall Online was so much better (and it's back again in New Dawn and Rise of Agon remake games). Overall, I don't really find anything which is new or innovative about LisF to make it worth the gruelling slowness. I would only recommend this game to those who want to role play their characters and hate every other fantasy game solely because their avatar's outfits don't look realistic enough for them...if you also have something specifically against Mortal Online.

												If you like endless hours of digging, building and dealing with a user interface that fights you at every turn this games for you. Dont get me wrong i like building gathering games, but this ones is gonna test you for sure. There are many issues that if you can deal with or work around. The game is playable and enjoyable. I feel though there is little being done to fix some of the biggest issues with this title. Mining buggy, Granite locations allmost non exsistant, Wagons unable to hitch horses. To mention a few. Just seems that the small development team is working on other things. I mean come on i care little for what a sheild looks like if there are game mechanics that require attention. So many older games do horses, wagons, digging, user interface so much better. I'm no developer, but isnt it common sence to look at what other games do better and improve apon it. Instead of reinventing the wheel and releasing what feels at times to be a broken system.			"

												I was a bit uncertain when I was deciding whether or not to buy this game. I saw there were some mixed reviews and some confused gameplay videos, however I'm glad I did, and this has been a very rewarding experience. Below I elaborate on but a few positive and negative aspects of Life Is feudal, I hope this helps you get an idea of how it plays.Pros:-Firstly, I love the medieval setting, the world looks great and it seems that the devs and really aiming for realism in the game design. The graphics are not as great as say, GTA V, but they are good enough to craft a very emmersive environment for the player.-The crafting system is VERY in depth and rewarding. You don't just find an iron colored rock and throw it into the asociated machine, you must prospect 'till you find signs of that mineral, dig around till you locate a vein underground, wait for the furnace to get hot enough to melt the ore, turn it into bars or ingots, then combine those with other raw materials to craft a variety of weapons, armor, tools and trinkets. Now I know this sounds daunting, and it can be, but because of that it feels oh so rewarding to craft something even as simple as your basic sword.-The skill system is also well constructed. For nearly every action that can be performed there is an asociated skill that must be leveled in order to become more proficient, there are many RPG games with these elements, but where Life Is Feudal differs is that there is a set skill cap that varies from server to server, but essentially means that no one person can do everything. You MUST work with other players and friends if you want to accomplish anything meaningful in the world, which makes a great addition to the game and provides even more immersion into the world.-Combat in Life is Feudal does have its issues, but overall i'm pleased with it. It's not like an MMO where you stand in one spot hitting hotkeys to launch different spells or attacks at your foes, it is based on contextual swings, combos, and weapon proficiency. Aim right as you click to swing that way, up to stab, and so on, meaning that combat is an active task, requiring the player to pay attention to his opponent and surroundings. In addition, you must ACTUALLY hit the  player or beast with the sharp end of your weapon to deal any damage. This may sound obvious, but in fact many games do not take this into account so strictly.-Due to the nature of the game, many servers gravitate towards roleplaying, to varying degrees. I feel this adds wonderful possibilities and immersion as meeting other players becomes both tense and exciting, leaving me uncertain whether I will end up in a forced labor camp, or with a new trade partner and ally. This is certainly the best way to play the game and I highly recommend you try it out. There are of course servers that aren't RP based if that's more your speed.Cons:-Though the game has come quite far since it was first released, there are still issues with optimization. Some low end PCs may have trouble running the game at higher settings. Though I experience a steady 50-60 FPS at a pleasant medium setting with my mid-range PC.-Crashes are still a bit too frequent in my opinion. I don't feel they are game-breaking, but they can be quite annoying. On average, I'd estimate I get a crash every 4 or 5 hours, be it runetime errors, game glitches, or a crash of the server itself.-I feel that the current price of $40 is a bit too much given some of the flaws still present in the game. Although I still greatly enjoy playing despite them, a lower price could help to ease the annoyance of it. I say this not based on the quality of the gameplay or core mechanics, but because of crashes and glitches. If you see it in a Steam sale, pick it up for sure.In conclusion, even though Life Is Feudal does have its issues, I still believe it's a good buy, and a great time. Boot it up and delve into the medieval era, carefully craft your gear, painstakingly construct your castle, and ruthlessly eliminate your foes.			"

								As a person that rarely trusts paying for something still in development, LiF has turned out to be the best chance I've ever taken in gaming, and is quickly becoming one of my all time favorite titles. The gameplay really fosters teamwork and a social community. The game scratches several itches. If you like Minecraft, you'll like this. If you like Mount & Blade, you'll like this. If you like traditional MMO's, you'll probably like this too.Pros A hunger mechanic that actually matters. Fatigue can leave your character stranded. A complex and robust crafting system  PvP - lots of potential. Meaningful time element - a new tool or building feels like a huge accomplishment. What's more, is everything you build serves a functional purpose.   Land ownership mechanic - extremely cool.  Nice environment. (They did a fantastic job on water, as well.)Cons It's not finished. There will be bugs. The UI takes some getting use to. There is a learning curve. It's not as steep as some are saying, but you'll need to use the wiki and other resources to build an understanding at first.  I consider this a pro, but list it as a con for others sake. "

								-Early access review-This game is super realistic...Focuses Largely on teamwork, Takes a few dozen hours just to create a basic mud hut by yourself. Giveing you an idea how hard it was to live back in the feudal era, and the importance of living with a organized group.For being in early access, It has so much content, you cannot possibly get through it all. Its too slow paced for me, so I will wait for some added features that will make the game more appealing for solo players who just like to survive. Pros: 1.This is the closest thing you will get to a mutiplayer/realism medieval simulator. (Aside from Kingdom Come:Diliverance that is more single player and much much better looking)2. buildings are beautiful, for such a large world with lots of content and with a big enough group of friends anything is possible starting as a bunch of mud hut savages who kill people on sight to building a wall to keep up other savages, and then thriving as a huge kingdom who still kill people on sight but with more deadly weapons and fully tanked out armor.3. Loads of content...for being in a alpha stage...it feels more like a beta, best part is they are adding more.even though I am taking a long break from the game. Cons: 1.You need a group to surivive or have any fun with it, your best chance is to wander around like a naked pleb and find a group. To know if they are friendly, make sure you have the mic setup...or people will kill you on sight for not communicating since banditry/stealing/murder is very common and penalties for doing so are spirit breaking.2. Its a very time consuming game. This is a double edged sword *no pun inteded* I find myself in the middle with this, If the game could make it exciting from the start to the end game as well, I would be putting much more time into the game. But leveling and many of the RPG elements are useless if you find yourself constantly starving searching for food (this is why you need lots, and lots, and lots, of peasants to farm for you- thus teamwork is the cornerstone of survival)3. Make sure you are on a server with good ping, this is obvious...Don't be that BR guy that joins a Canada server/US server with 300+ ping...you will get rekt unlike most shooters where its the otherway around. Also communcation is delayed on high ping servers for you, so having crisp ping pong conversations makes the game much more enjoyable...as well not watching people rubber band..I recommend this game because the concept is very good, Its worth keeping an eye on and see this becoming a very successful game even if its for a nitchy group of people -like myself-  "

												The fact that this game has mixed reviews says more about the people writing the reviews than the game itself. This game is a concept that you have to buy into to properly enjoy it and once you do it can be the most fun, rewarding and challenging game you can play. if you come into this game with a history exclusively of playing CoD and your prerequisite of fun is immediately gaining the title of super-army-soldier-squad-leader-fighter-man where the learning curve last less time than losing your virginity...you probably won't be a fan. Two main complaints I have read are excessive grinding and abusive server GMs. Again, this game is a concept you have to buy in to. If you were one man trying to build a huge keep, it would take you a long time, so yes, going alone in CoD mode #killstreak #lonewolf is going to get very tedious, especially if you have a low attention span. There are options to deal with this, play with friends, or join a collective of players on any of the many volunteer run servers with real RP elements. Which moves to the next complaint, abusive GM's. it's been sad to see how many people I have seen go onto servers (run by volunteers), get kicked for behaving like spoilt children when they break server rules and then come on steam and give the game a bad review, like it's the game devs fault that they couldn't muster the mental wherewithal to do or say anything amounting the more than ""lol xd i burn ur howse"" and then throwing themselves into the sea in a state of perpetual confusion. Felt a bit like a rant, but it annoys me because this game does deserve a higher positivity in it's reviews. Hats off to the dev team. tl;dr: Great game, for slightly more discerning gamers. patience and imagination required.			"

								I backed this game in its MMO pre alpha, back then it had issues with lags and crashes, in after that they changed it into a light version . The game at its current state is good but in a version where its servers hold a maxpop of 64 players, and quite stable. The game gets patched each month with new content. The plan according to the developers is to have the current version YO = Your own, done by the end of the year. MMO plans will resume after that. I gotta hand it to the game and its developers. It has so much potential and promise the game just sucks you in. If you are into WoW games and medieval times, this is the game for you.But as it stands now... The waiting just sucks.I give it 9/10 and a full 10 when its all done. The game is literally amazing!			"

												After playing as many hours as I have on this game between my own servers and public ones... this is one of the few games that I regret purchasing. Where to start? The combat is very lacking. The game mechanics are buggy. The leveling progression is grindy and so time consuming as if a mobile app game for phones. The controls are not adjustable. Very few mods exist that improve the overall feel and play. Plenty of bugs and graphical issues if you want to play it on the ultra settings (playing on an 8-core CPU w/ 970GTX yields crap). The music never changes. The learning curve is pretty harsh for any new players or any new player to a server. Good luck getting anywhere on your own if you decide to solo it. I do not recommend this game. Pass on it and look elsewhere.			"

								I love this game. Life is Feudal is as close to a midevil sim that you can play. The first time i spawned in a server many people were there to help me get to a place i could live. The first time i steped out of the forest and into the village was a jaw dropping moment and my jaw continued its deline when i relized how long it took to build things. It takes multiple steps to build everything. I have played this game for a few hours and still havent gotten a chest. This game forces you to cordinate with other people. It is almost imposible to do anything alone especialy concidering the fact that you need skills to do everything. It has a deep crafting system and combat system. The frequent floating tree and camra gliching through your body remindes you it is a game still in development. Its hard not to pick this game up regardless of its flaws. The rewarding feeling of simply finishing my first furnace was enough to have me sprinting to learn new things with the help of the town I have already helped to expand. You can help a town no matter how new you are. Its all about the end in this game.			"

												I've really enjoyed this game so far. The biggest appeal it has to me is the realisim and freedom. Many people complain about the time sink but for me I really didn't notice it. It makes small accomplishments more rewarding. Some things that I'd like to see improved:* I don't like how the different servers all can have a different amount of time to complete tasks. I'd like to see standardization across servers.*On a personal level I don't like the idea of level capps on some servers forcing you to rely on other players in the game. This could just be my play style but relying on other players to assist takes away from the accomplishment I feel when completing a project.			"

												This is a single player review only ( for what should be only a multi-player game)Have you ever wondered what it would be like to start a life in the middle ages from scratch as a normal person? The answer to this question is.......it's a grind. An unbelievable, mind numbingly slow, boring, repetitive grind. This is though probably what life was like for Joe Bloggs average peasant 1000 years ago - you work hard, got nowhere then you died (of boredom).The problem for LIF:YO is it's not realistic enough to be a true medieval simulation (thank the gods) but it is realistic enough to be an abhorrent experience as a game.So a few good points:1. Stable, smooth, good FPS even on high settings, no stutters, no CTDs (I have an intel i7 quad core, 8GB RAM and a GTX860M)2. The character generation, while somewhat limited with your options provides a SUPER looking (and sometimes grotesque) character to play that also looks quite good in the game world.3. The building models - all of them - everything I built looks top notch, building material textures are well represented, your first house is a hovel and it really looks the part - it almost smells rotten to look at, wooden fences are rough rickety constructions that look like they will fall over in a strong wind just as you would expect as they were built by an untrained pleb using the most base of tools. I found this part of the game faultless.4. Placement system for the things you build is simple, efficient and intuitively easy to use.5. Skill and stat development is based on doing related stuff rather than just gaining exerience points then allocating skills. Want to improve your strength and become a good miner - shovel dirt around, LOTS of dirt and your strenght goes up. Your intellect does nothing, but you get stronger.6. The number of 'workbenches' you have is enormous compared to many other games - LIF has furnaces, kilns, fires, drying racks, carpenter's benches, mortar & pestle, quern stones, beehives etc etc etc....dozens and dozens of things that each has a specialised use.7. The skill list and learnable 'technologies' is extensive and VERY rewarding when you actually gain access to some key workbench or process . The problem is the suicidal thoughts you are having from all the grinding you did to acquire that access and the knowledge you must grind a lot more to get access to the resource to put in that new bench.Now for the bad, and these are just a few typical issues:1.  Grind, grind, grind and then GRIND some more. It is truly unbelievable how bad the grinding is. I played with my development and speed settings at absolute max and after 25 hrs I have just learned how to operate a kiln and furnace....but I am still a ways off from producing my first iron nail ( I can't even identify iron ore yet) of which I need 45 to build a beehive. I haven't discovered bees yet though so  not sure what to do with an empty beehive!? I also still have no storage containers as they are far to technically advanced for me (it's the nails again you see.....). An example of the grind is branches, a common resource available from every tree. After 20 hours or so you will have an idea of how to build a wicker fence of branches.....you need 10...to get those 10 branches will take you about 1 minute of doing the repetivite 'harvest' action in front of a tree. You can tell your character to 'mass produce' so he/she will harvest branches from this tree until there are none left to take...super.....but you, the human, must sit in your chair and wait for 1 minute because your character cannot multi-task. Rinse repeat for everything. Some things are worse than others - searching for seeds to farm may require 5-6 minutes of rummaging in grassy map tiles to produce .... nothing ..... while you the player just sit and wait. If I 'mass produce' plant fibers from a tile (the character will gather fibers until he/she runs out of stamina) I literally have time to go to the kitchen, make a coffee and come back with a few seconds to spare before my character finishes with an underwhelming 15-20 fibers. GRIND-this is the game's dominant feature.2. The interface is somewhat clunky requiring endless button pushing to access benches and regain control of the camera. The worst of the UI has to be the inventory though which doesn't use a slot system (pleasantly refreshing) however it means your big bag of stuff actually looks like a big bag of stuff full of different things - a confusing mess with things overlapping and sitting on top of other thing so you can't actually see what you've got, add to this the fact that things often don't auto stack means it is a grind to manage it. You have to manually stack things together, manually move them around your bag so you can see what it is and trying to move a tiny item icon often results in you moving the inventroy pop-up window rather than the item you are trying to click on. Realistic but not fun.3. Building anything requires the proper tool and starts with 5-10 second building animation that lays the 'foundation frame' of whatever you want to build. Super. This animation plays even if you don't have the right tool equipped, after which you are told you don't have the right tool, must equip the tool and then sit through the animation again. Do this several hundred times and your will to live fades.4. The general learning curve is steep and requires great detailed information (eg . what temperature does your kiln need to be to fire clay roof tiles?) - you will spend an inordinate amount of time in the Wiki or searching for answers in Steam discussion threads for info that should be included in a pop-up for produced items.5. The game world is not great. It's a small (3kmx3km) map - that's ok in SP, you will spend all your time grinding in your immediate vicinity anyway. The map only has a couple of biomes - shorelines of beaches and lakes, flat sandy places, fine. There is a mountain, unremarkable, but again fine. Then there is forest - 90% of the map is forest with a few clearings and lots of rolling hills. It's a nice enough forest but certainly doesn't have a wow factor when you see it or walk through it. It is incredibly uniform to walk through - some parts are dominated by oak trees, some by elm, some has apple trees mixed in or pines or mulberries - a reasonable variety of trees that somehow all blur together to give you the feeling that this part of the map looks, sounds and feels exactly the same as that other part of the map I walked through 5 minutes ago which was the same as the forest on the other side of the island.6. Enviromental danger is pretty much zero unless you tread on a wild boar. There are no hostile NPC's anywhere aside from extremely rare boars, wolves and bears which don't move around much. You don't need water to live, food is abundant (you can just eat apples forever as far as I know without health issues), the weather and temperature are inconsequential. There is no sense of threat, danger or urgency, just the ever present call of the grind.7. It does some quirky frustrating things. I rage quick yesterday after spending 2 real world hours firing clay tiles in a kiln. I suddenly had a 'remove item' button appear on the kiln as one group of tiles looked like it was almost done - it was hard to see as the progress bar is miniscule - but they were still labelled as unfired clay tiles....take them out and have a look I thought. Nope, still unfired clay tiles in my inventory. Oh well, nearly finished...back in the kiln they go. Progress bar resets to zero meaning they have to be fired again for another 2+ real world hours.The negative list is longer, perhaps much of it can and will be addressed as EA progresses -but at the end of the day it's the grind. The game centres on and is built around grind. The kind of grind you come to mind because it forces you, the human, to sit and wait and wait and wait to accomplish.......squat.			"

												If you want a game full of bugs, no dev team working on it, and a scam artist of a company, then this game is for you. If you are an informed player and do any research or reviews on games before you buy, then I strongly urge you to pump your breaks on this game. I bought this game with no thought because lots of friends were playing it at the time. The concept seemed fun and amazing and the building system and mechanics for a new player were interesting. Once you put in an hour or so, you start to notice problems right away. These problems don't go away and become only more extreme as you keep playing. Numerous bugs from getting perma stuck, buildings not working, horse getting stuck on a rock, building working but then you can't gather your resources from it; and to top this all off, not a single dev gives two ♥♥♥♥♥ about fixing anything. I've looked back at people playing this game from 2014 and these same bugs are still in the game. I've learned this company has moved on to work on another version of the game (MMO) when they haven’t even polished this turd. What respectable and informed gamer would move from one piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥by the same company to another piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥I don’t know. But more importantly, what kind of developer does this to what I can only see as a fan-base of loyal customers and testers, to only take their money and♥♥♥♥♥♥out this product. Companies such as this are a reason many people fear to back any games or buy any games in development, just so the team can pocket the money and move on.Either way my rant is over. The game is fun, but I would not recommend it due to many short comings. The Cons outweigh the Pros.DO NOT BUY! "

												I think it's one of the best games ever made. It's a game where you need friends for to play though, soloing in this game is close to impossible.There are so many possibilities in this game, that it's just awesome. You have to take time to play the game though, and don't expect to have a whole village within a week. Crafting, logging, building, everything takes time, and a lot. You're fast if you manage to create a small shack within your first day playing (if you don't have any experience and you don't use tutorials). But if you're experienced, even then it would take about 4-8 hours to create it.Other than that, if you're planning on buying this game, make sure u have friends who are buying it to, cause I know most dislikes on this game are just because people try to play this solo, and that's just way to hard in this game.

If i joined a server it suddenly crashed somehow.But this doesnt lower the game fun. And allway think its an Early Access game.To have the most fun in Game i recommend to play with friends or join a group of other players, cause if you play alone, you have to spend to much time, and its going to be boring.I defnetly recommend this Game.

												LIF:YO is a well developed sandbox game with many of the elements we have come to enjoy from this genre. It is, as far as I have seen, a more mature game than Rust and is possibly more geared to those that enjoy more in depth crafting/building. The graphics are beautiful and enhance the experience exponentially. The devs are continuing with improving the game with weather and horse drawn carts soon to be added. If you are looking for an adult Minecraft I would say look no further.There are quite a number of negative reviews here about the game being buggy and crashing. I can honestly say I have never experienced this nor has my gf in the 100hrs plus she has logged. One thing I would say is that it is a complicated game and you will most likely have to watch YT or ask on your server how to do things at first, but once you get past these hurdles you will find the result to be very enjoyable.

												After my previous review being more of a angry♥♥♥♥♥♥post and then being proven wrong, I have decided to remove it and write a real review.Life is Feudal: Your Own is not a good game. Pros to LiF: YO over other games-Decent Graphics-World playing ability is better than say Rust-Has probably the best combat out of any sort of survival rpg some such game.-Has better crafting than some games in the same genre.-Hilarious(ly bad) voice acting-Except that part where Sean Bean was the voice actor.Cons-Some crafting skills are somewhat lackluster, with a simple menu and a bar not unlike wow, whilst others are mind boggling over complicated like alchemy which requires you to discover what every ingredient does by using it, varies what each does by player so you cant share knowledge, and makes the reagents hard to find unless you turn off grass.-On most servers, skill multipliers make you a ""master smith"" or what have you in a matter of days, and frankly thats not super fulfilling.-Has the same allure as Rust (15 year olds try out gun boat/big stick diplomacy)-The narrative makes very little sense.-Has worse combat than say warband but tries so hard to have direction combat-Has worse world play and building stuff potential than Wurm, but sort of not really half assedly tries to be like that too.-Sean Bean didn't dieSupposedly the first two features in the cons section will be rectified in the mmo by adding crafting minigames or some such, along with skill multipliers being set to ""1"", but this isn't the mmo now is it?

								Hi folks. Well after many hours watching youtube videos on this game and thinking long and hard about if to buy it or not. I can say it seems so far pretty well worth the investment. Ok this is my pc spec:Intel Core2 Quad Q9550 2.83Ghz5Gb ramWindows 7 64bit proGeforce Gtx650other random tatt bits etc like a hdd as you kinda need one of them lolAnyway does it run on my older pc with low ram etc compared to all these hyper modern gaming pc'sYeah I can safely say it runs sweet. I messed with all the graphics settings inc resolution, lighting, draw distance. I set all the sliders to max and it looked much sweeter. Guess what naff all (noticable) difference to the FPS it just works fine but looks even better.No super lag in dense forests and having to stick to beaches. It runs the same everyehere on the island (great).Do I fall through the floor or walk half way in the floor? Not once.Did it crash? very few times even after 200+ hours its not enough to complain aboutIs it any good? well since I purchased it earlier I aint turned it off and all the game time on record is one long stretch from then till now. It aint that long true but its fun fishing and making basic stuff. Kinda what I wanted from a game. A survival without stupid a** zombies trashing it, in fact just no zombies at all. yay!I am very interested in medieval games so this is why I was willing to try it even with the bad reviews. So far medieval hasn't even came into the game from what I played. I mean no knights in armour and castles. That fact is simply too far away in this basic, almost naked mans mind. All I could think about was food, shelter and wood. The fact that after setting up the basics I can move on to a simple town with walls or something is just a cool goal to look forward to.Tips I found although it may just be damn ovbious to everyone else are. Instead of right clicking none stop and selecting chop tree or take bark etc simply right click the option you want as default then whenever you see a tree or target resource, the left mouse click performs that action saving all the right click context menu fiddling. Of course you need to set it back and forth occasionally but it saves a lot of agro when doing the same set of things over and over. Once I figured that bit I started liking the actual game rather than hating all the right click and find what I wanted over and over.I would say if you have purchased other games that have not lived up to your expectations. As a survival game goes so far this one seems good. No zulu warriors constantly trying to remove your head whilst you build, no zombies groaning away ruining your perfect build. It seems like it is going to be quite fun overall and worth the money.Just as a note. When I set up the game at the start. I set it up as a private game so maybe that is why it is running so smoothly on my computer but hell I dont care if thats the right way to do it. It runs great and I can actually play it peacefully and work out what the hell i'm doing and get to grips with the game.  If you like me want to just get down to some peaceful survival gaming that is what I recommend.Since then and after weeks of playing I now own two servers and they are growing fast.  Still runs fine as I said weeks ago.  Everyone keeps saying how epic the game is and how they ""just love it"" and how for an alpha its crazy good.  It's better on a server tbh as its meant to played multiplayer.  I don't even want to stop long to update this post cos i've got some digging to do and it wont dig itself....play it and youll know what i mean...its too addictive.....			"

												I like the game but in it's present early stage I can't recomend it. Pretty expansive also for early access. At it's present stage all you can do is pry you find an apple tree to sustain you till you get your skills up enough to actually make, grow, and cook food (maybe as long as 20 actual hours or more) if not you will die. You start with basic hunting skills like fishing, making traps basic tools, but like if you catch a fish you will not be able to eat until you learn how to make a pot to cook it in. Then theres the camp fire skill, you can put all your fire wood in it (40 pounds or so)and it burns up in a matter of seconds! You will need to learn the forestry skill to make the proper fuel, otherwise the fire will be out before you can open your bag to put the fish in the pot.I only have a short time in the game but this is what I've discovered. A frustrating adventure into a waste of time.			"

								The trailers look really great for this game, but its really not fun in any way.  Expect to be wandering around barefoot in the dirt rummaging for sticks and rocks for the first hour.  After that, I completely lost interest.  The crafting system and UI are very clunky and unintuitive, and there really isn't a way to figure the game out short of googling mid-game for crafting recipes.  I didn't try combat at all, or village management, or even build a house.  I made a couple tools, chopped down a couple trees, stacked the logs kinda near one another, and was too exhausted after that to try and have fun.  Over all I'm done with it and will be uninstalling this garbage.  If Steam had a way to petition for a refund, I would be pursuiting that right now.			"

								I know of course this game is in early Alpha, but so far the game doesn't seem to show much potential in terms of quality of programming. In general /everything/ just feels very clunky and frustration inducing at every stage and there are tonnes of fundamental choices that just make this game feel old before it's even released (sub-par, DX9 graphics for instance). Combat is simply terrible and the engine feels awful. The default gather/skill rates also make the game a complete grindfest where progression feels dull, monotonous, glacially slow and generally unrewarding. Unfortunately I bought this game purely to join in with my friends who were too impatient and bought an unfinished game. LiF just isn't anywhere near finished or good enough currently to have fun with it despite the usual friend shenanigans, and with my group at least - that's saying something. Maybe give it a year and $20 pricetag before buying.			"

												I had fun for 60 hours, until the game stopped working completely. The devs don't seem to respond to any questions, and if you read the forums, quite a large number of people cannot play the game. The devs say it's because Steam doesn't download V++ properly, so they take zero responsibility for why their game is not compatible with Steam?? I would have recommended this game, like I said, for the first 60 hours. As a gamer, I frequentely ask myself: when I am on my death bed, will I regret all the years I spent playing games? Well, I'm pretty sure I would like the time I wasted playing Life is Feudal: Your Own. It is very unfortunate because the game was sooo fun. Then one day, my character started freezing like 3 - 4 times an hour and I would have to restart the game. Not a biggie, games can totally be frustrating and lol, hence the title of game.... Then, my character wouldn't load at all. I tried multiple things to fix it. Spent five hours last night trying various ideas from Steam forums, and from the devs themselves. However, if you're like me and not a complete computer software genious, then finding a solution to fixing the game becomes nearly impossible. If you have a computer saavy friend that is available 6 times a day to help you, then definitely take the chance wasting 40 bucks on the game. Although the game is ""finished"", it still feels very alpha. Every update brings more issues and you will end up frustrated and feeling ripped off. Obviously it's just one opinion and I am sure a lot of people have had more luck getting LIF:YO to play without encountering the MANY issues (graphics, gameplay, server issues, and more) such a large number of gamers have had. SO, if you are ready to invest god knows how many hours into a game, just to have it all be for nothing, then please do try this game.			"

								  Life is Fuedal is unique game that is sort of a hybrid of Minecraft and Mount&Blade. Scavenge, craft tools,fires, forges, armor, weapons, farm, hunt, mine, battle, build houses, and fortresses, and level up in the expansive and interesting skill progessive system. The game has plenty to do and is very entertaining, if a little slow paced.  This game would be one of my favorites of all time, if it wasnt for one thing; you rarely can get it working. You have to host your own server in order to play just by yourself. To get that working it requires most computers to download another program. Then if you get it working, wait about 10 minutes for the game to load(or wait all that time for it to tell you the local server can't be accessed, and doesnt work), and play for hours as you get immersed in the truely great game and have to go to sleep before the sun rises, so you then have to exit. Once you leave you can almost never get back to that server again and have to create your own world again. I've looked through many forums, and threads, and there are a few extremely compliated ways, submitted by users, that you may be able to fix it through downloading other programs and the command prompt. Even then the fixes don't help everyone. This has been a problem since a couple of days after I got the game, and even though multiple patches have gone through none has focused on this crippling problem.  The game it's self is well worth the price, but the inability to actually play properly ruins it. Don't get this game unless your a computer and command prompt wiz. It's a shame such a great game is unavailble to many people who have already purchased this game. Until this problem has been actually addressed and fixed don't buy it.			"

								If you are expecting the game to be like Mount & blade Warband, then you will not like the ""melee"". It sucks. Really bad. really really really realllly bad. Wait until it comes out to look at it as it is soooo pre-alpha it is not even worth your time to look at this as 90% of the game will probally change by the time it becomes playable and enjoyable. If it doesnt change 90% of its stuff then it will contiune to suck really really bad.....			"

								this game is not for everyone. it is slow and  very grindy. HOWEVER if you have patience and a group of friends or find a good community then this game is amazing, it is desgined to be played in a group. you build towns, cities and kingdoms by your own hands this game and eventually war.now is this game perfect or great? no it is good there are numorus bugs and glitches that can be found and some people have trouble logging in, but the potential is there as well a lot of content with the devs keeping intouch with the community with frequent updates. this is not rok. the game is slow, but if you can get past that it is great fun and rewarding. i recommend getting it when it is on sale.

								This game is one which i truly appreciate for the unique value one can find within. Rather than run about, chop down a tree and build a house before nightfall, it is set so there is a LOT of stuff you have to do before. This kind of gameplay is often overlooked in favour of a more minecraftian style, which is a shame really.Granted i have yet to scratch the surface of what to do, but already i love the idea, and the community. There is less an aspect of Rust, and more  just generally help one another.Basically i can't say what hasn't already been said, It's a great game and WELL worth a buy!			"

												As a server owner/operator I have decided to review LIFEYO from a game operation and maintenance standpoint. As you can see by the hours I have invested in this game, I love it. The critique I give here is out of love for the game and desire for improvements and is not meant to scare players or owners off. Consider it more of a this is what you will face as an owner statement.LIFYO is a grind both in play and in server operation. It is not for the impatient who want to get the best now, player or owner. Over the last year the Developers have made several changes to the menus of the game and the game itself so I will start with some of the menu changes.Be prepared to make several furnaces and forges. Before you are high enough level to make repairkits which need nails you will blow up many in the process. The forge and anvil used to last much longer before needing repair than it does now and in my view not much of an upgrade from the furnace in its current state. The crafting levels to make basic repair kits are too high in my opinion and should be a beginning level skill. Repair kits for a furnace that takes clay water and plant fiber to make, shouldn't need nails, so the devs should make a repair kit specific to those items or again make small repair kits a 0 level skill.Floor lamps being moved to the art crafting skill was silly. While I agree they shouldn't have been in construction, I think they should have been moved to the smelting tools menu and the skill level is too high. But that is just my take on it because I love lamps and hate the dark. The changes to torches were a blessing. Thank you Devs.The changes to raising and lowering items to combat log ladders and dirt ramps over walls. With the monument system the way it is these changes really weren't necessary in my view. They put a damper on creativity. There are not many servers for LIFYO that allow KOS or that have set judgement hours for these things to really matter.The way I see it is in a judgement hour situation if someone is making the effort to cut trees and lug logs to the walls of your claim and you aren't shooting them with every arrow you have thats on you. Same goes for dirt ramps and spirited horses. Yes, I get that most people find the jump factor of a spirited warhorse unrealistic but I find it fun and really not everything in the game has to be grindy and real life. It is a game after all. If someone is taking the time to make a ramp to my walls and im not killing them that is also on me.When I first started running the server there was a setting in the WorldID_1 file that allowed you to limit the height things could be raised. What they should have done is taken paintings and art type things off this setting and left it for the height of logs being floated. This would have solved the problems, but really anyone that didnt like the fact that you could raise and lower logs and float them like that could have fixed the problem by changing the setting in the file rather than complain.Now that the devs got rid of that option to adjust the height of things, beveled stone stairs dont stack right and clay is now nerfed making it harder to put in roads down mountain sides or build in high places. Again putting the damper on creativity in a game no new items are really coming out for.GM Mode. up until this last year gm mode as far as flight went worked great. Now dropping out of the sky in a spot you choose doesnt happen. You get dumped in the ocean. stuck above the horizon or dropped miles from where you flew to. Sometimes you now take fall damage or die from it. As a working Gm this is an annoyance especially when you get to the forest changes in the game. It has also become harder to maintain monuments for those on vacation as you can no longer feed a monument in gm mode. Having to create characters and take over a monument is a pain and eventually when there is more than 64 characters created on the server it starts throwing errors and ghosting messages in the console. I have also experienced fall damage teleporting to players.Mines, I love that they decay on their own. I wish unmonumneted settlements and unbuilt on terriforming as well as dirt piles from mines did to. Mines are killing players when they fight to get in and out of them. They throw you in the air sometimes to death. And they sometimes collapse on you while you are digging them if you aren't reinforcing from the get go.Players sometimes take fall damage getting off their horse. Horses wont go through some gates and you have to get off them and they throw you at unseen obsticles on the map. these can be as simple as a dip in the road or hillside.Decay, I don't know what happened, but it used to be that I could amp up player monuments, turn on decay at a reasonably high rate and the decay would take out terriforming, roads and unmonumented claims without burning down monumented ones. This isnt the case anymore and it doesnt seem to remove terriforming causing owners to either work like crazy fighting fires or work like crazy to undig old claims to get the grass back for new players without wiping the server.Last but not least and the biggest issue in the game is the forest algorithem. In theory this was a very nice idea to promote tree death and new growth to keep us from having to run tree scripts once or twice a month to thin the forest.In my view the tree script was less work and a better solution to the problem than what we have now. New owners beware. 220 days after server creation you will have a massive tree death in the west and south. You will lose almost all your hardwood, mullberry and apple everywhere. The description of how the algorithem works to balance trees to have lush forests with trees of all types is not factual. At 220 days in you will lose your player base because trees will die off at alarming rates leaving the west and south coasts almost barren and your players will go with them unless you edit your cm_forestry_maintenance.xml file changing that 220 rate to something in the thousands. The devs certainaly did not test this algortihem for the LIFYO map. While mass tree death may be good in the mmo on our tiny map it is devastating and a ton of work to restore things every 220 days leaving new players without hardwood to build with.Editing your xml file comes with a new set of problems. Lets say you change 220 to something like 1200. You will still experience tree death at alarming rates in 1200 ingame days If you are a no wipe kind of owner like me, which is another thing players hate, you will be fighting this issue at some point in your game no matter what you do. If you change these rates your forests will become over grown again at some point with no good tree script to help you fight the thickness of things as we were warned not to use the old scripts with the new algorithem.I think the devs need to revamp the trees on the LifYo map again making them all different ages in every map position so death and regrowth are not in huge areas at one time. The Lif Yo Map is too small for barren lands and nobody will build there. Case in point we see little building in the north because of the lack of resources and flat terrain. and speaking of resources it would be nice to have a granite source in the southern region. Lugging 180k granite from the big mountain down to the south for a castle is more than just a grind its a pain. I'm not complaing about the amount of mats needed mind you just the distance with no good rate of carry and no horse drawn carts as promised.(Sorry had to slip that in there somewhere)This is a good game, I personally love the game. I understand that the mmo was the Devs first dream but LIFYO was born and exists first and has a life of its very own and it DESERVES just as much attention as the MMO.While I recommend the game to players and owners alike I just wish the Devs would live up to their promises in the game and stop neglecting YO.

								The game is very special. I really mean it. I personally consider it being awesome and extremely addictive, but that's only because I accept the conception of this ""ultra-hardcore mmo medieval simulator"". Just be aware that it is a totally hardcore game. After approximately 50 hours in-game the only achievements I could boast with are a tiny wooden shack, a forge with an anvil,  a coop with a couple of hens and a small carrot/cabbage farm I managed to build. It took me about 30-40 hours of gameplay to make my first metal tool.  If you think you will just get into the game and start to PVP, experiencing all this “physics based combat”, you may be disappointed, because first few days in-game you will be just messing about in mud, trying to find something edible and not to die of starvation, or playing hide-and-seek with a bear, trying to avoid becoming his meal.However after realizing what the game actually is, you will start building your base..  first time it will be looking like a lonely peasant hideout, but when you get your skills raised, and maybe team up with other dirty peasants, your hideout will slowly, nail-by-nail, board-by-board, brick-by-brick, turn into a picturesque village, and then the village could be very slowly turned into a really impressive fortresses, the entire medieval city with high stone walls, towers, keeps, workshops, warehouses and safe homes.The game allows you to walk through a very rough pass from a dirty peasant to a noble lord, a dangerous thug, a brave warrior, or just whoever you want to become. All these and even more opportunities are featured in LiF, but extremely challenging to achieve.Is it worth to buy the game now you asking? Well, if you had fun playing such games as Ultima Online, Mount&Blade series, Chivalry and so on, you will probably enjoy Life is Feudal. However, you should bear in mind considering to buy it that it’s an early access game. It is pretty rough at its current state, some major features have not been implemented yet, some of them are still not working properly. But even now you could get some fun playing it, if you love the conception.What could I say about its visuals? Well, the game looks decently overall, I mean textures, the light, anti-aliasing and so, but animation really sucks at the moment – characters move pretty awkward, trees are not waving on a wind, animals do not “run” or “walk” they just “relocate themselves”, that looks ridiculous. I have to say that I am not fond of the engine, however if animation will get fixed, then it’s ok. And of course LiF is not about graphics at all, it’s all about its conception and a ton of opportunities it gives to you.			"

								9/10Be wary before purchasing this game.  It is not complete, and if you aren't the patient type of gamer, you might not enjoy it.  However, if you enjoy putting effort into what you do, and being proud of every little thing you complete, this is the game for you.  When my friends and I finally completed a Large Keep, (The hardest building to complete in the game), everyone on the server came to look at it.			"

								I have about a month into this game.  I love so many things about it.  It takes time to build your stuff, cool.  You work with others and gang up on annoying people, love it.  But here is the thing, there is no balance.  You work for weeks getting all the cool gear and a underwear dude strikes you twice and you die in full royal gear, like WTF?  Now some might say this is early access.  To be honest I am sick of this excuse.  Everything is early access these days and half the time they take my cash and never finish the game.Don't waste your money on this game yet.  It could be the greatest thing ever.  It really does have potential.  But make them work for it.  Get them to finish and balance the game before paying for it.			"

								Takes a while to get used to, and it's pretty rough on your card (devs need to improve distance draws and LODS to cut down on graphic demand) but overall it's fun.  Don't expect epic combat either, it's FAR from a good combat system.  Still though, I recommend.			"

								This game came recommended by a friend who described as a mixture of minecraft with something else. It does remind me of minecraft: you start with nothing, need to make tools from scratch and after lots of hard work and labour you slowly build your house, furnace and other buildings that you need or want.It is clear the game is not finished yet because many features of the skill tree arent implemented yet. Yet the game as it is now is a solid base. It looks very promising toward the feature. I am curious how they will build in certain aspects into the game but that is for later updates.As stated by others, everything you do can take a lot of effort. It makes it clear this game is most enjoyable when working together with others. If everybody does a part you make faster progress. Building, fighting or hunting, all is better when teamed up with a friend or two.			"

												11/20/2015 Edit: All the major game breaking bugs have been fixed. As long as youve got a lot of time on your hands and a friend or too. Youll have fun. Especially now that theres a lot more servers filling up.Edit: So apparently this actually getting attention and I just wanted to make it clear. I love this game. I enjoy it, its a great experience. But its in a bad state right now. Devs said theyve got a hotfix coming out today to fix some of the glitches, I'll edit it again once that comes out, but I will not change the original review, if the game is in a good state, then I will change my recommendation. But theres no need to remove the original, I feel it'll be good to see how far its come from the original release day in a few months.Tl;DR: Dont waste your time. $40 is WAY to much. $24 is still to much. Dont pay more than $15. Wait a few months, after the fixes by all means. Spend $40.Intro.. aaaaand it crashed.First off, let me say I enjoyed this game, in fact I loved it. Was loads of fun, crafting and building was great. But today on November 17th the game was ""Released"" and its absolutely riddled with bugs. Now that means one of 2 thingsThe testers didnt even test the game for more than 10 minutes at a time because, thats how often youll run into a game breaking bug.The devs were informed about the bugs and simply didnt have the knowledge or just couldnt fix the game before release.The bugs So you might be wondering okay what are these oh so terrible game breaking bugs? Well ones with * (supposedly) only be for those who had the early access game. And there will be a (supposed) fix at the bottom. *The UI messes up to a point where you have to restart the game, sometimes UNINSTALL the game to fix it.If an animal touches water..The server crashes. Yep. Straight up crashes. With servers of 64 people all running around and doing things, someone is gonna try to hunt. Someone is gonna crash the server. *The character model messes up, tears apart and will cover your entire screen. *Sometimes looking at trees will get the stuck on your screen to the point where you cant see anything.The Verdict This game was great before it released, granted the graphics werent great but there were much less bugs. So as it is, dont bother the game is, in my opinion, broken. When devs come out with fixes, sure by all means give it a shot. But never have I seen a more broken game on release. The devs are aware of it being broken. One of them has even apologized to players on the public forum about it. So theyre working on it. The game is currently the 7th top selling on steam, so theres loads of people playing. If you can look past the bugs, turn a blind eye..Youll have a great time. But its because of those bugs that  I DONT RECOMMEND THIS GAME. **The fix: Reinstall. People says it fixes it, others say it doesnt. Sooo take it as you will.			"

												I wouldn't consider this a ""survival game"" (at least not yet). Much of the community for this game is waiting for it's MMO version to release (which is over a year behind schedule) before playing again. Life is Feudal is entertaining if you enjoy gathering resources for crafting and base building. Each of the large bases our small group built across a handful of servers took an average of 2 weeks to build from scratch. Be advised: all servers are currently player-hosted, and in my experience unfortunately, most don't stay around for more than a month. Your mileage may vary. It can be very difficult to know wether or not a server is worth your time investment. You will want decent admins and reasonable rules. Ask questions in their global chat and see if they have a Steam group or other web page that describes their server. Most servers are either PvE or PvP-based. In my opinion, a PvP-based server extends the enjoyment of the game by quite a bit, giving you more to do during or after your base is built. Overall, I think it's a great game, but gets stale after a while since it's completely focused on crafting and player-to-player interaction.			"

												Ok so with the 1.1.8.0 patch we have had a crop growth problem (Waaay too slow) which it looks like you fixed YAY!.... The other problem you introduced is that all of the trees on our server started decaying down to a value less than 10. Literally all of the oak trees everywhere (I searched the database) have decayed down to a value between 1 and 10. Other trees are starting to do this too... You guys need to really really really test these changes... I cannot keep people joining my YO server because of the constant bugs that keep getting introduced. I will let you know if 1.1.8.1 naturally heals the tree problem on the server or not. If you release untested patches when the MMO comes out you will lose your fan base quick... I really like this game and I am hoping it will be the next big thing for PC gamers... You guys have the power to really get this game to take off.			"

								An amazingly addictive and rich game if you are willing to sink a lot of time into it. There are some tedious tasks to be completed if you want to work on any kind of large project, but the payoff is well worth it. Don't expect to have anything crazy immediately and understand that the game is built to be played in large groups. If you play it solo, you may find it difficult to get much anywhere. If I were to sum this game up into something you might be able to relate to, I'd say it has the mechanics of Minecraft, the look of Mount and Blade, and the feel of playing DayZ - but with a far deeper end game. As the game has only recently just gone on sale, it is hard to judge just how the end game will play (because there is so much to do/create/learn in order to get there), but it looks like it may play out like an open ended WvW PvP style game similar to Guildwars 2 or Warhammer - only that everything is driven, created, and destroyed by other players.

								Alpha State : 9/22/14This game is a mix of Mount & Blade and Runescape; which is a dream come true. You start off in the middle of nowhere with just clothes in your backpack. Then you must wander around looking for tree branches, flint stones and other stuff to make simple primitive tools to help you gather resources and survive.So far people seem to be cooperating and this game has not turned into a KOS game, which is not the point of the game in my opinion. The small towns made of shacks I found were friendly and welcomed you to join them. There are servers however that will kill you on sight; so just beware when approaching settlements.It takes a long time to accomplish things, so finding a few buddies is necessary to actually build a town. I have not seen any fortesses or stone towns yet, just small shacks and farms.- The game seems to crash when you use a mic near other people for some reason.- It still needs to allow players to add servers to their favorites list so you don't have to search for them again when logging back on.- Way too many server crashes.In its current state I recommend if you are patient and willing to get frustated a little; the potential for this game is immense if the creators keep working hard at it and don't abandon the project.

								That is one of two games I've been dreaming but never saw. Lots of potential and game need to be finidhed snd polished.

								Right, first impressions. Well, first off, I can tell you that this game  BEAUTIFUL. I mean, at the moment it's terribly optmised (I have a GTX770 but have to set the tree details at very low in order to not lag) but it still looks great.Soundtrack is amazing and suits the game perfectly.One thing though, this game take forever to do anything. You have to be patient, you can't do stuff almost instantly like minecraft, stuff takes a long time. Also, its boring alone. Find someone to play it with whether its a friend or someone you met on a server.Loading is another problem. It takes FOREVER to load into to servers, to be prepared for that. Like I said, this game require serious patience. But the loading screens are pretty nice, so you have something nice to look at.The game needs serious work but it is in alpha, so, ye. It is fun though, but you'd be better off buying it off of {LINK REMOVED} or indiegala for cheaper, or off the devs website. $40 is pretty steep, so is $35 but it's better than $40.I'll update this when I put some more hours in.

												Pretty good.However, I think it's still a serious W.I.P. since there are updates coming out like every week.So far so good, however it's got a few minor bugs which might give your gameplay experience a hard time.The graphics are good however, it is has low FPS on top notch PC's too, for some reason - I hope it'll get fixed A.S.A.P.But yeah, it's a good 'Survival' game set in the medieval era, you'll have hard time surviving but once you'll settle down it'll be a great gameplay experience.PS: Most of the players are friendly, unlike other survival games where it's ''Kill-to-loot-to-become-the-best'' ... Here it's co-operation to survive and to build a nice piece of land to roleplay on.So far 7.3/10 from me, might go up, IF they fix the bugs and fix the FPS.			"

								First I want to say that the stuff you see in the trailer for this game takes a long time to get, you're not going to start this game and start slamming down castles, this isn't minecraft. That being said if you like grinding rpg's and or sandbox games with crafting and fedual time period etc you should really like this game. It's got a bit of a learning curve but after you get past it the games very enjoyable. I recommend playing single player though or making your own server or joining in on a friends because griefing is bad and admins will abuse their rights if you have something they want, just saying.

								It's... Incredibly intricate, interesting, and promising at the current state of it.  But that doesn't mean that it's something that everyone will find enjoyment in.  Taking survival elements that're comparable to DayZ and Rust with mechanics for needing food or proper medical attention, crafting elements that put Minecraft to shame, terraforming elements and potential building mechanics that seem almost obscenely intricate...  It's promising.  Time consuming would be an understatement of the year though; in a few hours in a single-player game with the skills-gain set to a hundred times the base, it still took me the better part of three hours to get merely the most primative toolset.It seems like one of the best potential games for creating, influencing, and enjoying the fruits of your and you friend's labor I've seen in a long time.  That feeling of actually getting together an actual township, of raising together against a common enemy to defend the little you've scrapped together seems like it will be absolutely incredible.I'll need to wait for some stability updates and some of the other promised features before I find myself playing it too terribly often, with two or three hourly disconnects from servers, but I'm certainly looking forwards to them.

								An amazingly addictive and rich game if you are willing to sink a lot of time into it. There are some tedious tasks to be completed if you want to work on any kind of large project, but the payoff is well worth it. Don't expect to have anything crazy immediately and understand that the game is built to be played in large groups. If you play it solo, you may find it difficult to get much anywhere. If I were to sum this game up into something you might be able to relate to, I'd say it has the mechanics of Minecraft, the look of Mount and Blade, and the feel of playing DayZ - but with a far deeper end game. As the game has only recently just gone on sale, it is hard to judge just how the end game will play (because there is so much to do/create/learn in order to get there), but it looks like it may play out like an open ended WvW PvP style game similar to Guildwars 2 or Warhammer - only that everything is driven, created, and destroyed by other players.

								Alpha State : 9/22/14This game is a mix of Mount & Blade and Runescape; which is a dream come true. You start off in the middle of nowhere with just clothes in your backpack. Then you must wander around looking for tree branches, flint stones and other stuff to make simple primitive tools to help you gather resources and survive.So far people seem to be cooperating and this game has not turned into a KOS game, which is not the point of the game in my opinion. The small towns made of shacks I found were friendly and welcomed you to join them. There are servers however that will kill you on sight; so just beware when approaching settlements.It takes a long time to accomplish things, so finding a few buddies is necessary to actually build a town. I have not seen any fortesses or stone towns yet, just small shacks and farms.- The game seems to crash when you use a mic near other people for some reason.- It still needs to allow players to add servers to their favorites list so you don't have to search for them again when logging back on.- Way too many server crashes.In its current state I recommend if you are patient and willing to get frustated a little; the potential for this game is immense if the creators keep working hard at it and don't abandon the project.

								First thing you should do when starting a game in Life is Feudal; is to make sure your starting on the right server. Because theres alot of them, and that means theres alot of bad ones. There are more roleplaying servers than not, which is fair enough considering this is by far the best game I've ever played for Roleplayers. Which would be awesome if I was into that. But I am not. I prefer the open world sandbox PVP experience. Life is Feudal provides the most advanced way for me to enjoy that very experience. The best part about it would have to be the fact that - even in Alpha - it pretty much all works. Everything that they have in the game currently, mostly all works without any game breaking bugs or glitchs. There are plenty of those around, sure -  but none that make me want to not come back. This game is slow though. Progression is slow, but rewarding. However if you don't have some sort of goal to work towards in this game then it won't be enjoyable at all. You really do need to be able to envision what you want to create before you begin creating it. And before you even begin that your going to need to do a hell of a lot of basic work just to be able to make your vision a virtual reality. But it is so damn satisfying when you complete each and every little step of your goals. People you meet along the way will either help or hinder you. Either way it provides more fun, the survival aspects of the game are alot less visible in a non-PVP server - hence I do advise you play on a server that has no issues with theft from other players or murder. This IS a sandbox game and those mechanics ARE in it and they mostly all work. Plus this game is ALOT more fun when you make enemies as well as friends. No enemies makes your castle pretty useless anyway. So make sure not to join carebear servers. I might advise to wait a few more months before deciding to buy this game as they are planning on making it some sort of MMO, but...theres a big learning curve to it...so its probably a good idea to get it now just to learn how to start off when its fully released in September.

								Excellent early-alpha game. Mind the before, EARLY ALPHA. So no, it's not done and it's not perfect.Optimisation is still a long way to go IMO. I like to play my stuff full out on ULTRA but with LiF that's not a good thing to do right now even on my 4.5 GHZ i7 with 8GB Dominator Platinum RAM and a Geforce 780 GTX , I got like 20 FPS running it on full settings. I cut back to around 50% with all of it and it's pretty good now, still not 60 FPS but very playable, the slightly lower FPS doesn't get in the way considering it's not a super action packed game, it's pretty peaceful (so far). Being able to play on max settings with a reasonable FPS would be cool in the future though ! :)It has a few bugs here and there. UI could use some work, it's a little confusing sometimes which button to press, or when I want to craft something and need 2 menu's, i.e. my inventory and the crafting grid so I can drag stuff into my crafting grid, the crafting grid opens overlaying my inentory. So I had to drag drop it next to it in order to see it all, and it does this EVERY time, it doesn't remember me moving it from last time, which is annoying, but these are mere details that could be fixed easily. I did experience a crash here and there, but that's to be expected from Alpha stage.Crashing on this game sucks though, as the world takes forever to load, even on my beast PC when it's installed on an SSD it still takes a good 3 or 4 minutes for the world to load before I can actually enter the server and start playing. I hope that will still change later on so loading times are quicker!Now the reasons why I would recommend it big time! This game is EVERYTHING I've wanted for a long time. It's steep, learning curve wise, so you won't level to level 234353466 within 2 days. It takes time, and patience. Also I've found the community so far to be very friendly and helpful, which is rare nowadays. The game isn't based around fighting (yet) because it literally will take MONTHS to build a castle, and you'll need friends to do it. Without friends, alone, you'll take years. I'm like 6 hours in and just made my little wooden shed covered in clay and a furnace. That's all I've been able to get to, so it's a time investing game.Harvesting and growing crops is also a big part, as you need to eat. You can not farm and just find berries in the forest, but you'll have to go scavenge then. Or you could always go and catch fish, but obviously you'll need the tools to cook it properly. In real life you can't eat a raw fish either, so this is well done.It has mining, and you'll have to do it in order to upgrade♥♥♥♥♥♥as at some point you'll want metal tools instead of primitive ones. Mining is done well but could improve more IMO.To me this game is Minecraft, RUST, Harvest Moon, Mount & Blade and WORM combined. It's really good. I can't wait till it's out a bit longer and clans / groups of players have actually made entire castles and kingdoms and will try to take eachothers.As for the fighting physics I cannot comment as I have not yet been able to craft a sword. Maybe in a week or two ;-)The ammount of content you get for an early access alpha is great, bugs wise it's really not too bad the game is highly playable already. For the quality of alpha releases on STEAM lately where you spend money on totally broken games that never get finished, this is one I can actually recommend for a change.Highly recommended!-Link			"

Early Access Review
								I have played many Early Access and other Alphas.  This is by far the most feature-rich alpha experience I have had.  What is interesting about that, is that it is still considered alpha.  The content plans far exceed what is currently in the game, yet what is currently implemented outshines features found in most other alphas.  This Early Access release has yet to crash.  There are bugs here and there - mostly in the placement of items, or the cursor being slightly off from the item you just clicked - but nothing that has broken the gameplay.The only serious bug that has impacted enjoyment is the inability for me to find games hosted by friends, or for them to find mine.  I can see the list of servers, but it never displays the ones I'm looking for.  This is a known issue as of this writing.  As such, I'm not letting it affect how I feel about this game, but am listing it here so people know beforehand.All in all a great Early Access experience, and a game that will be easy to stick with, or keep coming back to, with each update.

								At the writing of this review the game has maybe 25% of the content implimented. I'd say maybe even less. Yet despite this My friends an myself have all easily averaged like 50 hours of gameplay and climbing. Especially if you play on the servers with a normal 1x skill progression and limited skill cap, it really makes you work together with otehrs as a community. It is an awesome sandbox game in it's own and it's not even nearly finished yet.I can't wait to see where this is headed!My only concern is the limits of the engine. Choosing Torque 3D over something like say Unity, is an odd developer decision. I've used Torque 3D before. It's not the worst engine ever made. But it has definite limitations compared to many other engines that they could have used.			"

												Great game if you have friends that you wish to build a settlement with. - that said even if you play solo on a popular server you can meet great people.game does have a few server lag issues and random crashes on heavily populated servers but overall it's not game breaking.Amazing how picking herbs and flattening ground can take your whole day away but in the end EVERYTHING in your base is there because of your team. can't explain how satisfying that feeling is.  PROS: - great building and ground manipulation system- usually great role playing by real people- great graphics, grass looks amazing.- fun combat- hours of fun per $ spent- easy to learn controlsCONS:- random crashes/ lag (everyone has them not just me)- very grindy game for newcomers ( have seen many people get tired of the game before the game actually begins..)-  would like some more character customisation options.. only 3 hair colours :/			"

												My favorite game ever! Strongly reminiscent of Minecraft, but with much more realistic graphics. Customizable characters! You do lots of crafting, building, hunting, and gathering, like a real primitive society.The only drawback for me is that it takes so much time to do anything. Even minor tasks take 3-5 seconds. I don't have all day, so this is a bit frustrating for me.Also, the world is rather too uniform for an exciting exploration experience. Get around this by playing on one of the online servers, where you can discover settlements and meet the people who have built them.All around, this is definitely my favorite video game.			"

								Gameplay:It's an alpha, and it's been in the works for 3+ years apparently. The game itself is pretty solid, but I didn't discover enough to know if buildings can be built, or anything else like that. From my experience, it was very slow and i had to turn everything down a whole lot, but patches come through all the time. It's an alpha.Why i recommend:They update it all the time. I bought it yesterday, and they constantly push out information, even if it's not a patch. Communication is key, and it's certain to grow into a full game, as the team seems very dedicated.			"

If you buy this game you will never regret it later as you will see how awesome everything is in-game specially with the unique features they have during the medievel/chivalry time.

The layout so far is very interesting. Hopefully, the progress of the community will help bring a fruition of chivalry and granduer of a very well styled game.The slight kinks int he system that come with terraforming are present, clipping and unregistrered blocks. The growth cycle and time frame of items and weather seem off but there are all things expected at this early in the game.			"

												As a truly hardcore RPG, this game is not for everyone. LiF is a realistic medieval sandbox sim with a lot of unique features combined in it. Honestly, the learning curve of the game and the heavy grinding you have to go through will be too much for most people as it is very time consuming and it requires a lot of teamwork and patience. In my eyes this game has great potential. It has come a very long way since its launch and the developers have fixed and added a great deal of features to the game and countinue doing so. Overall - a great game if you have the time for it!			"

								Excellent early-alpha game. Mind the before, EARLY ALPHA. So no, it's not done and it's not perfect.Optimisation is still a long way to go IMO. I like to play my stuff full out on ULTRA but with LiF that's not a good thing to do right now even on my 4.5 GHZ i7 with 8GB Dominator Platinum RAM and a Geforce 780 GTX , I got like 20 FPS running it on full settings. I cut back to around 50% with all of it and it's pretty good now, still not 60 FPS but very playable, the slightly lower FPS doesn't get in the way considering it's not a super action packed game, it's pretty peaceful (so far). Being able to play on max settings with a reasonable FPS would be cool in the future though ! :)It has a few bugs here and there. UI could use some work, it's a little confusing sometimes which button to press, or when I want to craft something and need 2 menu's, i.e. my inventory and the crafting grid so I can drag stuff into my crafting grid, the crafting grid opens overlaying my inentory. So I had to drag drop it next to it in order to see it all, and it does this EVERY time, it doesn't remember me moving it from last time, which is annoying, but these are mere details that could be fixed easily. I did experience a crash here and there, but that's to be expected from Alpha stage.Crashing on this game sucks though, as the world takes forever to load, even on my beast PC when it's installed on an SSD it still takes a good 3 or 4 minutes for the world to load before I can actually enter the server and start playing. I hope that will still change later on so loading times are quicker!Now the reasons why I would recommend it big time! This game is EVERYTHING I've wanted for a long time. It's steep, learning curve wise, so you won't level to level 234353466 within 2 days. It takes time, and patience. Also I've found the community so far to be very friendly and helpful, which is rare nowadays. The game isn't based around fighting (yet) because it literally will take MONTHS to build a castle, and you'll need friends to do it. Without friends, alone, you'll take years. I'm like 6 hours in and just made my little wooden shed covered in clay and a furnace. That's all I've been able to get to, so it's a time investing game.Harvesting and growing crops is also a big part, as you need to eat.

												Excellent game!There are still some bugs in the game, but none that are detrimental to gameplay really. Most resolved with a quick relog. Game looks beautiful, especially on high settings, and music is fantastic. Well worth the price if you're into sandbox sims.A thing to note; this is not a game for you if you want to build your kingdom in a day! This game takes time. Depending on server settings, trees and crops can take 24 hrs (real time) to grow, houses can take (up to) 200 logs to build, and being able to carry 3 at a time = long process. Much quicker to play as a group. My suggestion is to get a friend or two, join a server with 3000 skill cap, and learn how to progress down the different trees first. From there you can find a server with a lower skill point cap and split the jobs between guild mates.			"

These reviewers played the hell out of the game, and have the nerve to thumb it down.If you like sandbox style crafting games and are looking for a more hardcore medieval setting, this is the game. It crashes like crazy, has stuttering issues, and few truly great servers. It's a fantastically designed game on the back of a schizophrenic codebase. The glitches are worth powering through for the emergent gameplay that weaves itself with REAL teamwork encouraging mechanics.Despite the technical issues, even the haters played it for hours on end. And yet they still have the audacity to not recommend the game. I really don't get it.			"

								Alright, so it's definetly in development...However, unlike some games out there in the world, this isn't a bad thing. The mining needs a tender loving touch, as it can be buggy alongside some of the terraforming (minor for terraforming, but they're related in terms of changing the world/ground). The game holds a lot of complexity, and the skills are all intertwined to some level. Failure to have a dedicated person in each profession in your growing little village in the woods means- eventually- one of you, if not all of you at some point, may be stunted in development. It holds a lot of potential, and is an enjoyable game is you can tolerate it's developmental status. The community if great, and unlike other games, not -everyone- wants to kill you...			"

								this is a very fun game i enjoy it very much i would suggest this to whom ever like to roleplay / build their own kingdom how they want it to be . however if you do close and leave the game make sure to close the counsle if you dont and you try to open the game you will have to close it and wait 10 minutes for it to allow you to open the game or you could just simply shut off your computer . this is just one minor error to the game other than that i belive that the game its self is rather enjoyablew to play with friends and by yourself i do think that maybe before starting the game watch a how to play on youtube and then get started other than the game being hard to play when you first get i highly would sugest this to any one of my friend whom i would think would enjoy a game that would take more than 3 days to complete the game i find that arnet very many games out there that take more than a week witch is just sad but saying all of that the games that do take longer than a week are still the best in my books so i would buy this game it is amazing ! have fun adventuring			"

								First thing you should do when starting a game in Life is Feudal; is to make sure your starting on the right server. Because theres alot of them, and that means theres alot of bad ones. There are more roleplaying servers than not, which is fair enough considering this is by far the best game I've ever played for Roleplayers. Which would be awesome if I was into that. But I am not. I prefer the open world sandbox PVP experience. Life is Feudal provides the most advanced way for me to enjoy that very experience. The best part about it would have to be the fact that - even in Alpha - it pretty much all works. Everything that they have in the game currently, mostly all works without any game breaking bugs or glitchs. There are plenty of those around, sure -  but none that make me want to not come back. This game is slow though. Progression is slow, but rewarding. However if you don't have some sort of goal to work towards in this game then it won't be enjoyable at all. You really do need to be able to envision what you want to create before you begin creating it. And before you even begin that your going to need to do a hell of a lot of basic work just to be able to make your vision a virtual reality. But it is so damn satisfying when you complete each and every little step of your goals. People you meet along the way will either help or hinder you. Either way it provides more fun, the survival aspects of the game are alot less visible in a non-PVP server - hence I do advise you play on a server that has no issues with theft from other players or murder. This IS a sandbox game and those mechanics ARE in it and they mostly all work. Plus this game is ALOT more fun when you make enemies as well as friends. No enemies makes your castle pretty useless anyway. So make sure not to join carebear servers. I might advise to wait a few more months before deciding to buy this game as they are planning on making it some sort of MMO, but...theres a big learning curve to it...so its probably a good idea to get it now just to learn how to start off when its fully released in September.

												Life is hard and life is grindy (Note: i played this game before the release and somehow my progress of hours spent is removed)Life is Feudal has characteristics shared by many realistic sandbox survival games: progression is slow, it’s a challenge to learn, and finally, the endgame is simply a more elaborate and protracted version of the rest of the experience. Maybe in the end your community, if it can somehow survive the raids and attacks from others and finds a way to really communicate and cooperate, evolves into the Renaissance. I know that I will probably never see it, because I don’t have the time or commitment to find out. Life is Feudal  is not enough fun or rewarding in the short term, and the long game is only for true devotees.			"

												This is a detailed, slow paced, time consuming But very fun game. Particularly if you find a good populated server with good GM's (admins). This game is a good take on the medieval survival series. It has a large world (until you get a horse) to explore and scout out either looking for freinds and allies or people with good loot to carve up and loot. Each server is different and more populated servers are more fun in my personal opinion.Thanks for reading and i hope this helps you make a decision.   :D			"

												It's a really cool game, im gonna compare this game with reign of kings because probably everyone have played that game. It is not the same, life is feudal is way way way harder. In reign of kings its ragdolled asf, which life is feudal isnt. In RoK it switches between night/day way to fast, and all the servers usually have nightkos so u dont have much time to do anything at the day. In LiF it takes way more time, and there is a counter for example year 1027, 4 october which is really cool, but alright away from the simple stuffs. LiF is WAY WAY WAY WAY harder and takes WAY WAY WAY WAY more time than in RoK. I have 15 hours on this game atm, and i havent even come far, neither have i learned the game. If it would be RoK, i would be king with the best walls and best gear and everything. This is also way more roleplay, if u do like roleplay i suggest strongly to play this game. There is way more to tell, but i havent gotten far in the game.			"

												With almost 500 hours online in LiF I can definitely say I've got a feel for the game. If you are looking for a game with in-depth crafting this one is for you.  When you first pop into the game it's just you and the environment. Your first tools will be primitive.  Your first encounter with an animal...will you be the survivor or the prey.  If you are into contruction of houses and settlements then this is the game for you!  You can start with a simple hut and ultimately finish with your very own stone keep and villages.  As of this moment you can only play LiF on a private server but that is due to change after the March 2016 CBT of the MMO.  Once this game goes live as an MMO I can only see it getting better!			"

												Wurm Online meets Mount & Blade... kind of, but with a lot of bugs/crashes still to be worked out. I think this game does a good job at stopping all the trolls you would normally see on games like Reign of Kings. It creates a hard and soft health/stamina system so that recovery takes much longer.  A troll can still steal, raid, etc, but honestly I have seen ZERO hackers and it is much easier to supress trolls in this style of game. With the right GM's or settlements, this game is solid.  However, it is very grindy, and I prefer a higher skill gain rate like 7X.  So many skills are inter-twinned that you need to have either a lot of people working together actively or a much higher skill cap like some servers have.			"

								First I want to say that the stuff you see in the trailer for this game takes a long time to get, you're not going to start this game and start slamming down castles, this isn't minecraft. That being said if you like grinding rpg's and or sandbox games with crafting and fedual time period etc you should really like this game. It's got a bit of a learning curve but after you get past it the games very enjoyable. I recommend playing single player though or making your own server or joining in on a friends because griefing is bad and admins will abuse their rights if you have something they want, just saying.

												Life is Feudal is certantly not for everyone.  It is my personal opinion that the majority of players on steam should give this a pass. But then why am I giving this not just a positive review, but an extremely high recommendation? Because I love the living jeebers out of this game. The amount that you can asprie to, the different things you can build, and above all the many different people you meet combine to create a next-level experience. But it is extremely important to find a server that YOU enjoy, that has rules that YOU want to live by. This game is grindy as all hell, but the satisfaction from watching your campfire grow into a fortress through pure hard work is immense. The labour is extreme, the time required enourmous. But the progress is undeniable. As of writing this review, I have approx. over 60 hours in this game. With the help of a group of about 10, we've managed to raise one house and one warhouse, train 5 horses, and fully arm 4 of us. This took us over a week, with players constantly on. There is no denying or mistaking just how hard progress in Life is Feudal is. But if you are the kind of person who enjoys putting in the hours to reach new heights, this game is for you. Make sure you find a nice server with good GMs, a nice group (or even person) willing to teach you, and the patience to see those garden herbs turn into a steel factory. Oh, and keep a sword close by at all times, and watch your back. PVP makes Life is Feudal truly Feudal.			"

Realistic and quite complex combat but clunky at times. You can learn special combos and skills which give damage boosts etc. Lots of armor and weapon choices. Lots of good servers with active admins - i havent seen a hacker so far.CONS: Not the best optimisation. It depends on server and how its ran. It can be very laggy and glitchy.

												You have your choice of either doing boring and repetive tasks, or trying to deal with unemployed insomiac PVPers that wreck your paper fortress, constructions and items while your not online. The only other thing is to do is some hunting and it is pretty lousy as the animal AI is just horrid. Game mechanics are just wierd at times as well. Some things in the game are just mind-boggling illogical.Now if your one of those insomniac PVP players and really like ganking people and ruining their day and making them cry and quit, it's great fun. I highly encourage people with that enjoy that type of playstyle to join in on the carnage ths game has to offer you. This game is designed with you in mind. It is WAY easier to destroy than to build and super easy to off people when they are not expecting it.Personally for me it just started to seem like work and the fun factor diminished after a few weeks, especially as most other left the game for something funner to do as well. I tried 3 servers, results about the same on each. But hey, YMMV and a really active server might be different experience.   "

												A detailed review to put aside the confusion and misinformation you may see in other reviews, including many of the negative ones. Firstly, this game gives the impression it is a game not yet truly completed. They appear to be frequently updating the game and patching issues. The reason this is a good thing however, is this is a game already in a state workable enough to be a proper game, and as of yet I have only experienced minor connectivity issues for being on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DSL internet. I'll be fixing that problem soon enough by getting broadband. Secondly, this game is full release, not some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2-bit indie game on early access with a dead community and shady devs. Now, let's get into the real meat of the game, the gameplay. It's worth saying up front this game may have a medieval setting but it's intended to be a sandbox RPG more akin to rust or minecraft rather than a survival combat game like DayZ, or a medieval combat game like mount and blade or chivalry. Most at least basically knowledged people understand this game is a life simulator and while there is a great deal of things you can do in the game it also means you need alot of time to do it. This is a hardcore game for hardcore, dedicated gamers to sink many hours of gameplay into.The crafting system is complex, realistic, and in depth. Not limiting you to just crafting items and buildings, you can change the very shape of the earth itself in the game with the terraforming system. A bit awkward at times, especially when trying to flatten out ground, but the overall mechanics are very easy to use once you know where to get them. RIGHT CLICKING IN THIS GAME IS YOUR FRIEND TRUST MESurvival is done by two things, health and eating. Your health comes back over time, and you can heal with medical equipment later on. Eating is easy, you can find apple trees, pick and eat apples. It's easy enough for the first several hours of gameplay I survived off apples until I could cook myself meat instead. I have only played on RP servers, rather than dedicated PvP servers, but I can safely say that most of the community is smart as long as you play this realistically. Think realistically, RP as a man or woman in the middle ages, play smart, and you'll usually survive. You'll have a better time if you make or play with friends. This game was clearly meant to be played by groups of people working together. You can solo this, but it's putting yourself on hard mode for no reason if you do. Now it's time for the Pros and Cons in my experience.Pros- Expansive and in depth crafting system, simple skill system to go with it.- Hardcore survival with some servers being PK for characters you make. - 64 player servers. - Can run on ultra settings with 60fps relatively smoothly with minimal framerate drop, ultra settings do not kill the game's framerate, and I'm only running an i5 alienware basic.- most of the community is friendly. - Definitely meant to be a social experience, teamwork, and friends make the experience much better.Cons.- High learning curve.- Not intended for ""casuals"" to be capable of remaining on the top.- Can't be done very well without dedication.- Not optimized to be played by solo players. - AI animals in the game are horribly awful, completely dysfunctional, stupidly OP, and glitch into objects (running in place)			"

												Awesome game, can be slow to get started, recommend you find a group to have the most fun. The strength of the game is the attempt of realism... You start out with essentially nothing. Go to a tree, break off a branch, get a rock and some weeds.. and poof, you have an axe. You have to work for everything and all though its time consuming, its not difficult. When you get hungry you dont have to take on a wild boar or hope to find a carcass to devour, just dig in the grass for an edible root, or go to an apple tree and pick some apples.You wont be a master at everything in one day. You need to actually choose what direction you want to go. Want to focus on farming? Find a settlement that needs your crops to make armor and have them make you armor... want to be a carpenter? Trade your chests and furniture for weapons etc. You wont need to do meaningless quests, there are none. The game exist as it is, the story is what is actually happening, the bandits you encounter are real people that want your stuff... the alliances you form are with real people, the items you may find actually were made and belonged to some poor soul that met his demise by nature, or another player.There is no ""leveling up"". You dont need to reach level 25 to ride a horse... Gather some apples, find a wild horse and tame it. Build a stable, mate the horses and sell the offspring. If this all sounds tedious and boring then you probably wont like the game... The only complaint I have is the server wipes... I am eagerly awaiting the MMO with a persistent world because having you progress erased is the one total killer in this game. But still totally worth the money and time.			"

								This game has everything that a consumer of the sandbox-building rpg world variety recent flurry of Early Access games needs. The devs are VERY committed to staying on touch with to community on all platforms, and already in release week we saw 3 patches to the game.One of the best crafting systems I've ever came across, coupled with an excellent balancing of the economical/resources system ensuring all items are always valuable. Top that off with the potential to slowly turn into a Mount & Blade killer, this game has a lot to offer already and is constantly growing. 10/10 even in the earliest of states, I cannot reccomend enough.

								I'm not sure why I'm enjoying this game, but I am, lol.Life is Feudal combines the persistent world antics of DayZ, tech progression of Minecraft, and combat mechanics of Mount & Blade to make a fantastic Medieval MMO.  The skill branches and attribute allocation are the most logical and satisfying I've yet seen in an RPG.  This is a very intelligently-designed game with a lot of potential going for it.Yes, it's in alpha, but runs fairly well.  FPS drops and server crashes notwithstanding, there's plenty to do in the game and lots more on the way.  If persistent worlds are your thing, such as Rust or DayZ, you'll love Life is Feudal. :-D			"

												::::Re Re Edit:::::So in this game I will point out right off the bat that it is time consuming.  However, It usually is rewarding.  The game for the most part is very realistic and now that it has fixed most of the bugs and performance issues, it can be a real joy to play.  It's a very in-depth game, and Lone wolfing in this game is not advised.  You should have a group of people to play with or find some group of people to live with, as thats the only way you can really get anywhere in this game.   Now on to the good stuff.In LIF:YO you Are able to create a character and customize what you name is, how you look, and what base skills you have.  Once you are done you are spawned onto a large island.  On this island you will either rule with an iron fist as a great ruler, Find fame and glory in the battles fought by rivals, trade goods, farm as a peasent, forge armor and weapons as a blacksmith, and so on.  It's a RPG with a whole lot to do, and everyman is important.  With the way this game is set up people are forced to not resort to KOS.  As every man is again, important.  So not like Minecraft or Rust where you alone or 2 other dudes can become the most feared group on the server who can destroy entire cities.  In this game, if you want to rule a large area with power, you need people.  Or you could be a small group of people that rob or kill random travelers (Bandits)  Really the best way to describe this game is that it's almost your Alt life.  It takes a team of like 15 people to build buildings, and you have to check the harvest all the time and Wars will end for a short time when Harvest time on the server comes around.  I mean this game NOW is pretty great, but it is not worth $40.  I would say if it where on sale or goes down to around $25 or so, then it is worth your money.  I Also wish that they would offer other maps in this version. They don't have to be Much bigger then defult one, just other styles so there is more variaty.::::Old(not important):::: I wanted to edit this.  The game is fun.  Or it can be fun if you find enough people.  However The time it takes to make things can take a very very long time.  It seems things have been shorten because people have made things quicker but I still really wish they would make it easier.  Also flux to make Steel is stupid change that please I really thing it should be mic iron with anouther ore or heat it with much higher heat useing charcole and it uses just a little more iron...  That would be better... Go for my secound idea devs please.  Your game would be so much better and make it where plants don't die out until 4 hours after there growth cycle is done.  I hope the devs read this get this			"

								I've only played the game for 30 hours at this point so I don't know everything there is to know about this game, especially considering I'm trying to play w/o using outside resources/info. However, I can safely give some of the glaring pro's and con's that I've come across in this game thus far. PROS Very in depth crafting system with a semi-complicated ""tech tree""Realism; no storing whole tree logs in a backpack (you gotta lug that♥♥♥♥♥♥back to your house VERY SLOWLY)Early signs of a robust ""politics"" system       +They're adding the starting of a ""land claim system"" in the next patch (Dec. 25-26)Graphics are surprisingly beautiful on higher settings and still hold up on the lower settingsCommunity, overall, has been ""realistic"" so to speak; there are many that want to help and/or include you in their      groups, but some that don't want anything to do with you or try and rob you.       +Coming from other survival games, it was a surprise to not have everyone you meet immediately try and kill youYou change the world! You cut down a tree and its gone, you dig holes in the sides of mountains, your quaint shack in the woods is a sign of your presence on this world. CONS Combat is on the broken side at the moment (but is being slowly fixed); some weapons are weak as balls, some armor makes you a war-godGrinding - you'll be doing a lot of it in this gameQuite difficult to figure out on your own (There are very few in-game explanations on how to do something). It took me an hour to realize that you need to flatten ground to build things (felt like an idiot afterwards)Server stability is relatively okay except some actions are restricted on most servers. Remember the digging in the sides of mountains? Well that can cause severe server lag and long load times for that server, so mining is restricted.Solo play is tedious and requires A LOT more effort to be rewardingThe game isn't fully optimized yet so there are some spots where fps can drop considerably, especially if there are a lot of man-made structures in a small areaI should also mention that this particular game, ""Life is Feudal: Your Own"" is a sort of ""test run"" for the larger game ""Life is Feudal"". The latter will be the former, but on a much grander scale. The servers will be hosted by the developers (they're currently all private) and hold thousands of people, the world will be 49x bigger, and will be complete!It goes without saying that this game is EARLY ACCESS, but there is still quite a lot of fun to be had. If you have a group of friends to play with or are social and can make new friends, this game is a hell of an adventure. If you like to play alone, there's still plenty to do, but be ready to work a lot more for it. Overall the game has a lot of potential, receives frequent enough updates (1-2 a month), has developers that communicate with their fans, and already offers a large amount of things to do in a medieval sandbox environment. Again, I'm only 30 hours in, but I forsee myself spending at least another 200 hours in this game given its current state, especially considering that within my first thirty hours, I've only managed to build a tiny house and plant a carrot.Life is indeed feudal.

								I loaded into a server and was dropped right next to my brother in a large castled city.           We first watched as six or seven mounted knights jousted or glory and honor. My brother and I then went north to the westside of the nearby lake and started gathering supplies to survive the night. Just then a rock whizzed by my head as i look to see what it was another just misses me, and I see a heavily armed woman loading her sling for a point blank shot being that she is now just 20 feet from where I stand. I raise my arms and kneel down in surrender and shout I yeild! she notices my brother dart of into the woods stupidly gives chase, for he has dropped everything on his person and is twice as agile as his persuer. I quickly jump up and sprint west to the coast where I see brother casually gathering sticks a quarter mile north of me. We now have a location set up at the base of the northwest mountain he is a blacksmith and I an alchamist. Once we are settled we are fit to supply nearby towns and villiages steel armor, swords and tools. If bandits don't kill us first.			"

I just wanted to jump in and say, sure this game is hard at first; sure the UI could be less clunky, but you just need to give it a few hours. Do not expect to jump into a game and be building a castle with all the fixings. This game is Brtual and Unforgiving and because of that its a beautiful representation of how Online Games need to be. We need more games like this!Learn the game, be social, make friends... People forget this is how Online Games can be. It should have never become about getting 2 friends together never talking to anyone else and getting handed the world. In this game YOU GOTTA EARN IT SON.   "

								I have pretty much had the best and worst of this game, In the sense that I have had the utter dissapointment of it not working at all just crashing. And on the other side Ive had it run perfectly fine for hours on end. I WOULD recommend this game as it is playable with a good bit of content for an alpha game, and unlike most early access games I feel as though this one WILL BE FINISHED someday. We have had consitient updates with big bug fixes and additions of new buildings, items and skills. The majority of my friends were put off by the initial price but once they were able to see it running and working they all op'ted in. I feel like when you purchase this game you are helping the dev team to finish the game not to line their pockets and leave you with the husk of what could have been great. I am really enjoying the time I am spending in the game and look forward to the finished product. "

												For those who say its slow! That is not entirely true, do the right assignment to level up faster and choose the right server for faster level up or gathering of stuff. I just started playing on the Medieval Kings server and having a good time.The game still has some bugs and other things developers need to work on!Fore those who consider buying this game remember this game has a learning curve and not all things will be figured out by yourself!In game you can use F1 for the tutorial or pressing Alt Tab and u can use YouTube for better understanding of matter.Hope to see you guy's			"

												As a lifelong roleplaying game fan, playing Life is Feudal: Your Own is an absolute treat. The server I'm on is well populated with people who are totally into the roleplaying aspect. We're all building something amazing together. I absolutely love it.Life is Feudal is played at a different pace to anything I've played before. I wouldn't say it's 'casual', because the depth in this game is astounding, but i'm not always looking over my shoulder or worried my house will be raided when I'm not online.When I first started, I played alone until I had an idea of how the game works, and I didn't get very far. I soon joined a guild and my experience of the game became so much deeper. I highly recommend finding a team of people to work with. You can't learn all the skills necessary to make a successful settlement, but teaming up spreads that skill burden around, you can specialise, choose a profession, kit out your team, go to war...The possibilities are only limited by your imagination.

												Part Wurm, part Rust, ALL fun!  This game is trying hard to be the (non-fantasy) re-invention of Ultima Online, but in 1st-Person, while somehow managing to mitigate the negatives and building upon the strengths.  Some call it a 'medieval simulator'.  Is this game perfect?  No.    Most of the complainers are whining about how this game doesn't walk them through on how to get a fabled Crown of Idiocracy while solo, but instead makes them actually do work, maybe even having to trade with others, in order to accomplish anything of value.Is it easy?  Definitely No!  This is NOTHING like your child's World of Wizards101.Life IS Feudal.  Some people just can't handle difficulty.  Can you?			"

AMAZING!Okay the gameplay itself is astonishing. I have never played something of this quality. BUT.There are a few things that needs tweaking (YES I KNOW ITS ALPHA) but the thing is there is actually no way of creating a storage box of any sort in the early stages it requires mid level skills and well playing on my own server with 10X xp was a huge grind and the LiF server is going to be set at 1.As for the landscape WOW  it is pretty damn beautiful. The sun shining through the leaves of the trees flickering on the water and the waves wash up onto the sand, I have spent half of my gameplay admiring the mere beauty of the environment. Except for 2 occasions where I felt like I was going to fall to the pits of hell because of a few glitch spots in the landscape.Some sounds are also a little bit out of sink but obviously will be fixed later. Also some crafting times and skill times take a lot longer than they should I mean even opening a sack takes a good 3 seconds when you just want to look in it an be done.Overall the game is fantastic, obviously needs a few tweaks here and there as there are a few bugs that need attention for the next update. The realism is quite refreshing and fun in a gritty this is taking too long type of way. In comparrison to Minecraft and Rust once all of the features are active and even before release I believe this game is going to blow them out of the water. It is already coming close to it.For those of you borderline wanting to buy and not sure because you don't want something that is going to be a dead end, the quality of this game and the work that has already gone into it assures me that the devs are going all the way.10 / 10			"

												A very nice concept of Online-Roleplay, Survival and Open-World. It has some flaws with crashing for no reason, but overall its a neat game that can bind you together with other players.The whole crafting system is pretty well made, with all the details each role has to offer. Despite the flaws it has alot of potential in my view, with very nice support if u have a problem. Maybe not exactly worth the 30€ but 20€ would be a good deal for it. I can just recommend this game especially if you can/want to play it with some friends.			"

												Greetings, playable this game have been around for quite a while and many players feel like there should be more fruits, vegetablesand trees to plant. Indeed it is a great game everyone that likes building, PVP and some great RP. It is a game that it is hardly played by one person in a claim unless that person is just open for trades due to lack of skills and help to do so much. Terraforming should be easier, many complains have come by and users tend to give up because of how slow the process of terraforming. In general even if the server's terraforming is set high. I do know the creators work hard and try to make as many changes and there is barely any time but horses with carts have been told that they would come for so many updates but this change haven't been done. As many streamers and players have said the graphics are great but could be worked more so durability on big buildings that can be taken down really easy. Hope to see new people join Your Own and always remember.. Life Is Feudal.			"

												Life is Feudal appeals to some things I've longed for in a video game. Community.You're tasked to thrive in this land with others, but the journey is arduous to go alone, whilst you can do so by all means, the game does reward you for partying up due to the skill cap system, to go into depth;Every server has a unique skillcap and XP rates, some servers have a relatively low skill cap to ensure you can't do every single thing alone, and therefore endorse co operative play, some let you do it all alone and increase the XP rates so it doesn't take as long.I'm currently playing on a server with a 1600 skill cap, which therefore allows me to learn my core skills to survive, but I can't do everything, so I joined a few people early on.  Our small guild of 4 people consists of a hunter, a chef, a mason, and myself the architect, whilst these may be our 4 core strengths we can all help each other in other ways, I can forge whilst the chef can't, he can bowcraft whilst I can't.The only time I've ever felt such community was back in the days of the DayZ Arma 2 mod, before the KoS craze, it was amazing, I believe now LiF has filled this void.I intend to be a full time architect on this server, and to help build for those who can't, and get paid in resources I can't otherwise acquire. All you need to do, is thrive, and you can help others to do so too.The PvP is also greatly thought out but rarely sought after, Judgment Hour comes every 3 days in my experience, where all of your gear is not protected by your claim, but is free to be looted by all, this creates an intense purge like feeling that both scares me and makes me laugh. People tend to go crazy around this time to get anything they can get their paws on, I've not yet died at all in my (current) 42 hours of gameplay, but all you lose is the gear you hold, and some XP (More xp if you have negative karma)After 42 hours, I've only just obtained all my core skills, this can be percieved as a pro or a con, to me, It's both, I enjoy the everlasting gameplay but at times some skills are just a drag to learn.My point is, after 42 hours, I've barely scratched the surface of what the game has to offer, and I'm already loving it.I'm learning architecture, yet I've barely built anything amaazing so far, what happens when I learn Bowcraft, warfare engineering, herbology, Masonry, Carpentry? I can get endless gameplay out of something like this.TL;DR 10/10			"

								I was a little wary buying into the this alpha, especially when I had never heard of the studio that makes it before. However, since buying it and joining a community that hosts a server, I have had an absolute blast. At the moment, this game is what you make of it. If you buy it and play on your own, things will be painstakingly slow and lonely. If you join an active server, or better yet an active community that hosts one, you will have fun learning to play and get into hilarious scenarios with other players.For those who say this game is like DayZ, they are right in the fact that you need to eat in both games, you can be killed in both games, and you can play both games in first or third person. Those are pretty much the only simliarities.This game is focused on cooperative gameplay as opposed to every man for themself. If you like working with others, even if it is to raise an army to raid another castle, then this game is for you.So far I give it a 9/10. (not a 10/10 because of alpha bugs, crashed etc). I will review this game again in a few months.			"

												About half of the negative reviews about this game were posted when it was still in pre-alpha complaining about bugs and issues. That's their problem, you cannot expect to have a wonderful game in pre-alpha..that's the point of pre-alpha is to fix the issues. Now the game is actually released and, for the most part, bug free. Many of the other reviews complain about how long it takes to do things. This is not Minecraft, you cannot make a town in a day. Things take a LONG time to do and the game is amazingly fun for people with more patience than a 12-year-old. Ignore the negative reviews about this game, they're all posted by impatient people who expect a fast paced game. This game is absolutely amazing and the people are too. It's impossible to play this by yourself and that's the point. There are many guilds that will gladly let you in, I highly recommed this game for patient, RP loving players.			"

												This is my ideal game.  If I use a local server, I can roam the wilds and build myself a home in a wonderful environment - perfect escapism - light a campfire and cook some food.  There are many crafting skills to learn, buldings and objects to create, crops to grow and animals to look after.  My laptop is probably minimum spec to play this game but the visuals are still great.I look forward to future developments.  Rivers would be nice along with the ability to build and sail boats.  Being able to sleep in the beds, sit on the chairs and have roaring log fire inside the house would also be great.  There are no birds (feathered) in my world but maybe that is because of my low spec laptop.This game would be truly awesome if it was ever made to work with VR.			"

												This one has the potetional to be THE SANDBOX for all the lovers of the genre. Still a long way to go but depth is incredible. It feels like Wurm Online with good graphics (but dont mistake one for another please, both are unique in own way).One word of STRONG advice: Play in a group. Solo play is only for PVE or RP servers but MMO will be cutthroat world without something like empire in EVE to protect solo players. The world is wild and life is feudal, which means ""let me kill you and take your stuff"" for most players. Not Rust evil, but expect Rust-kind-of crowd at the start. Hence my recommendation to find a good group of players. You have been warned:)			"

								Fantastic game for the reality side of things especially the length of time needed to earn the experience needed. This game is definitely a GROUP/COMMUNITY game as you will need to progress through the experience levels of each role in order to achieve your goals.Your role, no matter what it is will be critical for each other player in different stages throughout.More maps would be advantageous, as would a map creator.Life is Feudal: Your Won is, by no means, a short game. It will take a lot of time and effort put into the game in order to achieve.While there is no actual end game, the playability is dependant on those you play with and the time that every player puts in to it.Suggestion for this game is to have a group of people that will put in a certain amount of time on a specific day or days and to keep to the plan.Graphics are fantastic and the framerate is stable.Personally i love this game.

								There's something soothing and peaceful about the crafting and farming side of this game.  You have very few storage options, and none at the start, so you have to get into the habit of only taking from the land what you absolutely need.  You can optimise the trees you find by paying attention to their quality, and before long you're surrounded only by big, green, healthy looking trees.  As long as you start somewhere close to water, clay, and game you'll have what you need to start your little settlement.The game needs a lot of work and refinement still, and has a lot of minor but recurring issues with its GUI setup, but once you get the hang of that it's pretty smooth sailing.  There are some issues with very basic things (like once you close the pop-up message box, which you almost have to, you can only exit the game by commanding the server to stop with ""quit();"" and then ending the process for the client through Task Manager) and there are problems with you needing to know so much about how to start before you do.  Tunnels are never clear exactly how they'll end up when you start them (so you might not be able to get out without the /stuck command), you need granite to make castle walls (the only way to level up your architecture skill--besides half making the walls with just the rocks then destroying them--which you need to build the keeps) which is only found in the centre mountain.All that said, it is a very enjoyable game once you get going with it.  After you make your  first full volley of mistakes, anyway, and are willing to start again in hopes that you'll make fewer of them and actually be able to get somewhere.Also a boar took over my little village briefly, and knocked me out and stood around like a smug little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ every time he saw me until I could take his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥out.  Now my little village has bacon.			"

It will take a lot of time and effort put into the game in order to achieve.While there is no actual end game, the playability is dependant on those you play with and the time that every player puts in to it.Suggestion for this game is to have a group of people that will put in a certain amount of time on a specific day or days and to keep to the plan.Graphics are fantastic and the framerate is stable.Personally i love this game.

								This is not an easy game to pick up.  The learning curve is steep and success requires the investment of significant amounts of time.  That said, it's game with immense scope and huge potential.  Once you master the basics of how to ""level"" your character, the gameplay is quite enjoyable.The game is not finished.  I hope to see significant polish put on before official release.  That said, unlike many other games that need not only polish but also substantive content, the majority of the game already exists and it is solid.The emphasis is on realism: Say you have a animal hide and you need to dry it (one step in the tanning process).  You've built a drying rack (not too hard) and are ready to start.  There is no simple button with a quick progress bar: it takes an hour of actual time for the hide to dry.  Nevertheless, there are occasionally activities and game mechanics that need polish and certainly don't feel realistic (Hares drop chicken meat when killed?  Did I miss something in biology?).  Overall, the core is solid.			"

								The game is very good, alot of potential and worth the price for the amount of time you will spend just learning how to play it. If you get this game you will have days, weeks and months of fun. One warning however, be sure to pick a server that has a good set of rules and a GM that is very active, this game can bring out the worst in people. Beware of the trolls, work with people and always remember Life is Feudal.			"

								This game has a lot of potential. The only problem is that they do not have enough developers to push patches quickly. I am sure with the purchasing of this game thought, that they will be able to hire more devs and push updates more regularly. This game is highly unstable for the moment, but that can change soon. They are activly working on fixing crashes and bugs and pushing new content to the game. Buy the game and support the companies development of it. =)			"

Early Access Review
								After reading alot of negative reviews of people who have played the game less than 10 hours i'd formost like to start with the negatives. So bear with me there aren't many considering this game is early access.Negatives-1. Yes its buggy.  (not sure about people saying about constant client crashes i've played 50 hours and had 3 client crashes)2. Yes alot of functions aren't implimented (early access)3. The game play can seem like a grind, its slow moving, and the game definately requires team work.4. Wolves are OP, no way if i whack a wolf with a sword 10 times is it getting up to still take bites out of me.5. Graphics seem to take a toll on my machine, i can run battlefield 4 on ultra with no graphic lag but for some reason if i don't drop the graphics in this game i get alot of graphic lag.POSITIVES!1. Time investment is rewarding - I spent hours cutting logs, while my friend spent hours making nails and metal bands, while another friend spent hours flattening a large area.  At the end we sat on a hill over looking our 50-60 palisade wall settlement and said... f**k yeah.2. A Sense of community.  I am a GM on an aussie server called ""Aussie LIF"" open trade between settlements gives u a sense of diplomacy!3. Team work is fantastic, no better feeling!4. Even though incomplete i've sunk 50 hours into this game, i know not much compared to some people but i feel like i could play it for days on end if i had the time5. Going for a stroll, take a walk, smell the roses so to speak.  No other game of this genre that i have played has created the amazing beauitful atmosphere i have seen in this game.6. DANGER - A real sense of danger, will a wolf be sitting behind a tree, will you stumble across a band of thieves and murderers while you travel to a neighbouring village.7. If you want realism, if you want a hard core drop into medieval time period this game is for you!  If you want a mine craft hit a block 6 times with a pick and u have stone sadly i think you should probably stick to mine craft because this isn't for you.			"

												So I came back to this after release and can I say, it has progressed so well. Don't be fooled by playing it on your own. THIS GAME MUST BE PLAYED WITH OTHERS YOU WILL NEVER DO ANYTHING ALONE!!!! This game at first doesn't strike you as much but once you get into it I'm 20 hours into this server with a few guys I met and its so worth it.I admitt the start is kind of boring but once you get past that hour or two and with a little guiding this game becomes so enticing, the grinding is slow but SO rewarding and addicting, frankly the combat is fun and scary, if you're on an RP server it's a really great atmosphere.Overall to sum it up this game provides a chilled, very rewarding grind with intense moments that really keep you here.The RP is good and the MMO looks really well, ignore the bad reviews, don't be such a millenial and actually give it a chance, this is early access however they sure have kept their word!!!See for yourself!

It's like real time tree growth.Servers need more settings to control many aspects of the game, like tree growth speed, instead of forcing so many things on you.  There are a few settings, but there are many needed.  I don't want to hack your script files to try to make things how I want.   Just give me a xml setting for tree growth, or set your hard coded default to a sane value.			"

Product received for free
												TL;DR: This game is awesome but wait for the MMO or pick this up on a sale just to end your thirst for the MMO.----My first touch for LiF was from the MMO closed beta. Despite the crashes and occasional bugs, I enjoyed the game very much because everything is time consuming, hard and can sometimes feel like work but the feeling of accomplishement is way beyond explanation. Life truly is feudal. During my MMO closed beta period, I joined this guild X and after the Beta MMO went down for maintenance, we still decided to play together and my guild leader gave me free copy of LiF: YO so that I can join them.Life is Feudal: Your Own is very similar to LiF: MMO but since the servers in ""Your Own"" are hosted by other players, the rules can get messy and the leveling rating of skills can be adjusted so high that this game becomes way easier and this is a relief for those who do not like to work really hard to get nails or rope just to build a chicken coop or a well. Also the map of Your Own is a lot smaller and it's always the same island unlike the MMO that is one big world.Despite the fact that the world in ""Your Own"" is just boring and small, everything else in this game is nearly perfect. You can and have to do everything from scratch. It took me nearly 3 hours just to even out the ground so that I can build my first shack and basic stuff like Kiln so that I can make charcoal from billets that I saw out of the wood that I cut down myself with the axe that I made myself from the rocks, sticks and plant fiber I gathered with my bare hands. This game is very deep and like everything in this game, even explaining it is very time consuming.The thing about this game is that it's hard and complicated and it can be frustrating to start build a camp, a town or a fort when you realize that you really need to do so much work to be able to do the simpliest stuff. The thing here is that every player should find other players to play with and divide the jobs between players and actually play as a feudal community.  This game also has PvP and you can attack who ever you want where ever you want but if you die, you lose everything.Personally I enjoy this game vastly, I hope that the developers just make the MMO version for this game stable enough since it's pretty much perfect in all the other ways when it comes to open world sandbox game but I will wait for the MMO to come out and take it more seriously and use ""Your Own"" as an learning tool for incoming challenges.

Early Access Review
								Since I've finished the tech tree I feel I can write a fair review.The game is basically Peasant Simulator, and it's a really good concept with a lot of promise. There's a few things it does really well and others it doesn't but luckily the bad ones are easy enough to fix.Let's get the bad out of the way:* This is currently a grind because of how many loading bars you have to suffer through to do pretty much everything. This however is a placeholder until they get minigames added for each task. It's singlehandedly the most unappealing thing this game has. Even if you get iron and steel tools they don't speed the process up, they're just lighter so you can carry more, which is a disappointment and I feel should change and add a multiplier to. Skills don't speed up the loading bars either, just unlocks things.* There is no property protection system at time of writing. If someone finds your stuff buried under a pile of dirt, well then tough luck. There are a lot of ways to get around this though, like creating multiple mule characters or being clever with how you hide items.* It's an grind until you are able to make metal things. But after that things get really exciting because your options explode.* No guilds or land claim systems at time of writing either.* The whole skill system and UI is uninuitive, and the wiki is pretty much required reading for your first time doing anything. There is no tutorial beyond an F1 menu that tells you what your hotkeys are.* Performance is pretty unoptimised but that's to be expected of a game in alpha.Now for the good:* Mount and Blade style combat. Need I say more? It's also got a Total War sort of formation system as well, provided you have enough people.* It has a focus on team-based gaming since the skill cap means that no one person can solo everything. There's a huge focus on trading and co-operation. If you play this alone it is going to take you forever to do things. More people means everything goes faster and has a set role to specialise in. I really enjoy that sort of aspect. Fun scales with how many people you're with.* Even in this early state the range of things you can build is absolutely fantastic. Towns actually have a meaning and a function and grow naturally with what you're doing. I've had my small shack with my friend grow into a respectable-looking trading outpost and that's just with two people.* The community is generally friendly. Just keep a respectful distance from their settlements when you talk to them or otherwise they may interperet you as smashing and grabbing, which is a fair assumption.* The building and placement of items is really incredibly freeform. Options to finely raise, translate and rotate pretty much everything. It really allow for a fluid and natural looking set of buildings.* It's got a really solid terrain deformation system. If you throw a bunch of dirt or rocks on a hill they will slide down the hill and raise it as it would in real life. It's quite impressive - never a seen a game deal with soil and gravel as fluid-like before. It also remembers properties of substrate. Fertility of soil, what kind of ground material you're dumping etc.As it stands, LiF has a ton of potential, and if you're playing with a medium-large group (4-5+) you're gonna have fun.  I don't regret paying 30$ for it when it was on sale elsewhere. Really looking forward to how they grow the features and fix the issues.			"

								ok so i decided to try a early access game for once, but i did have basic expectations i thought would be met, such as.....  how to play the game,  you basicly get popped into a world and bam fend for your self, ... like really  go to it, there is NO direction, im about 2 hours in and thankfully i figured out how to ask another player how to start crafting.... i could not imagin being in a development stage of a game and asking people to pay $40   to support me when i cant put the time in to explain in a tutorial how to actually play the game. anyhow i have high hopes for the game but i  am so dissaproving that steam allows games on for sale at this point in developemnt..

												I don't usually post reviews for games as we all have our own tastes and what one person may enjoy another often dislikes, with that said however I had to say something about this game. I've tried a few of the so called sandbox survival genre games but never really felt that imersed by them and always thought they lacked something. That was however until I stumbled upon this gem!The game is highly imersive and very addictive, harvest are affected by the weather, crafting has multiple strands so nobody can be the master of all trades and the scope for good RP is great. I've been fortunate enough to be able to join a fantastic RP server and well I think my number of game hours say it all really.ProsThe game doesn't hold your handNice graphics, with day & night & seasonsTrue sandbox, be a farmer, craftsman, noble, bandit or whatever you wantTrue sense of achivementskills improve with useConsCan be daunting if you don't give it the timeCombat takes some getting used to			"

								Very fun medieval survival game. It has got to be the most fun boring game that comes to mind for me. This game can take time when doing things and is best played with friends as it'll take you forever to accomplish small tasks. Also, if you're the type of person that needs a game to walk you step by step through a task, this game is not for you. This game is a rather complex survival/crafting game. I totally recommend this to fans of survival games and have patience.			"

												Really fun and immersive also really time consuming, you need to have friends to play this game with really as doing it alone isn't much fun. The best part of the game is building and the combat is also pretty good. There are some bugs with the sprint aspect as when you run out of sprint you guy kinda just sits there for a bit allowing people to attack you but its not that bad. But byfar the best part is looking at the before and after of a village or town you make, all the hours and time you put into terraforming and build realyl make the town your own. Currently the biggest problem is finding a stable server to play on that won't die on you. Most people are really friendly in the game.  Overall definetly worth the money, and a great way to make friends and have fun with your current friends.			"

												For a bit of background my ideal game would be a full PvP, full loot medieval mmo. Similar to the MUD's of old!This is a tricky one. On one hand I love the concept of the game and it does seem to run quite smoothly however it is extremely long winded which in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing but a new player should be aware of it.Crafting isn't overly intuitive and requries frequent looking at the wiki. Combat was straight forward enough, similar to Mount and Blade or War of Roses (although not as good). The biggest let down for me is the claimed areas which are fully protected against looting or damage, some servers have a judegement period but this just seems like a cheap cop out. This has always been the way though has it not? Crafters and PvE'rs wanting safe zones but the PvP'rs after at least the chance to wage war. This also prevents terraforming in the zone as well which is frustrating when people claim the zones next to an essential resource. I understand that this is done to prevent griefing when players are offline but it would be better if you could hire NPC's to guard your land or had player areas that would respawn after a certain time unless they were taken out my seige weapons and claimed by another group.Overall I wish Steam allowed for a maybe reccomendation. The keep building is fun and coming across other player settlements is great and it really is pretty free with what you can build and where. I think it has a solid base game here and will grow into something good albiet not what I am after. For people who like building their own bases, limited PvP and a free roam area it is a good bit (assuming you have plenty of time).For me though the search for a full loot mmo continues.			"

												I highly recommend this game. For starters, it is a game that started in early acces and ACTUALLY CAME OUT OF EARLY ACCESS! About the game, the graphics are pretty good, but the gameplay is what sells this wonder. This game is an extremely in-depth role playing, survival game. The devs have brought this game a long way, implementing new skill trees, things to build, ect. There are AI in the game, but only animals, all other humans are players, because this is a multiplayer based game, but you still can play alone or on a private server. Overall, this is one of my favorite games to play.			"

												I bought this game about a week or two ago and played some hours. (~90hours)I really like this game, it has alot of potential. I really hope the devs will continue adding some new stuff, and fix bugs.It has a few bugs, some weird mechanics(combat) - but building a village with other people is a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of fun.Dont expect it to be like minecraft, where you start building and 3 hours late you have a huge palace.When you first play the game, expect to have nothing but a small flattened area with a furnace on it after 5 hours. It is really slow paced, and i mean REALLY slow. its more like a medieval simulation. Survival in my opinion is a little bit too easy(no heat/cold, no drinking, plenty of food).You will find yourself mining for hours, planting crops for hours, harvesting them a day later for hours(depends on rates of the server).But after alot of playtime, you just look at your little village and think about what you have done to archieve this. This motivates you to keep going and make it even more awesome. Add a wall here, some towers there, maybe a windmill and so on.29,99€ Is a bit much, so i would wait for a sale. But its definitly a fun game, and i got what i paid. (excuse my english, not a native speaker)			"

												First time playing. And seven grinding hours later; I have nothing significant to show for the effort and time put into it. And we were 2. Can't even begin to imagine just how many hours you have to invest in this game, to actually reach some sort of steady gameplay, not involving the tireless grinding required just to make a claim.If you have countless hours to spare, then this is a great sandbox-survival-crafting game for you! Very detailed indeed. But I would not recommed this game to anyone as semi-casual as myself. The time and results ratio alone, makes this game very unrewarding. First it impresses you with it's graphics and character-builds. And then; it crushes your hopes and dreams. When you've just spent 7 hours constructing a forge and anvil - with ressources gifted you by other players - only to hit you in the groin with the depressive realisation of not having an effing blacksmith hammer.Thank you, but no thank you.

LiF has become my current daily game! Its really everything I was looking for in a game, And no Stupid Zombies!My only real con to this game is the huge Learning curve, if you stick it out and get past that, this game ends up being a great game, and all the things you learn along the way, you will be like ""why didn't I try that earlier...?""

								To say this really short: This game does not worth the current cost of 30 euros. There are many things that makes this game unplayable and boring. If you expect it to be anything like Minecraft where building goes, its not. There are no free building at all in this game. Every building, furniture etc is premade which you simply craft as a recipe. You cannot play this game alone either, or with ""few friends"" you need more like 20 people to get anything out of it. It's an MMO without the Servers, you need people to play it. Why you need people? Because there's a limit what you can do yourself, you can't do everything. It takes days or even weeks to get your first house build, if you dont have the nerves to wait this long, this is not for you.The game could have potential as a real MMO which its heading towards already, but as for now its all I just said.

												Hello Community,let´s start with the good asspects of this game!It´s an open sandbox game, where you can buid everywhere and change your surroundings. (100%)- it takes a lot of time, but you can really form a whole new area- only down side is, that the grass doesn´t grow back, so dirt stays shipped- building freely what ever you want (with the given stuff), some stuff take a long time do buildThe Crafting- mixed feelings about the whole context menu thing,- the skilltrees got remade, they are mostly logical now (expect some hick up´s in farming one)- Overall it´s interesting to doPvP / PvE / RP- PvP, fun but it need´s some fixing, (70 / 100)- different builds are availabel, no omny build (stats) seen so far!- siegwarfare needs some more tweeks, but is fun to do (85 / 100)- PvE, the AI of animals is just bad! (10 / 100)- in the early game wild animals are important, in late game, they just bother you.- it´s not too hard to survive in this game, never starved.- RP if your into that kinda stuff, there are good servers out there for it- since the game give´s you a lot of freedom how to build you can play out nearly anythingGrafic´s- since the D11 patch, a lot of stuff looks way better ( 70 / 100)- When all the model overhauls come in, I thing it will look even more nice then.IN TOTALthe game is good! If your into that kinda game. If your not sure if you like it, look it up on YT, make sure you got a recent video and watch some LP. Many people buy it and don´t got the point, what it is and start to complain....75 / 100 ATM			"
