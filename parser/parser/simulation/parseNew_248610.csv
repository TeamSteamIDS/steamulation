												Door Kickers is one of those pleasant surprises that comes every now and then.This is essentially a Top Down SWAT Team Simulator that is extremely Tactical. (And I'm not using the word just because it's cool)How would I describe Door Kickers ?This game reminds me of older releases that change the way FPSes are played such as Rainbow Six and SWAT.This is a slow and methodical game as it'll brutally punish you if a mistake have been made. Thought and precise movements must be taken into account if you wish for all of your troopers to survive that one bloody great gunfight.How does this game differ itself from the rest ?First of all, it is innovative. This is done in the style of the briefing phase in Rainbow Six, but it is completely real time with pausing mechanics so you are able to change your plan on the fly other than having to exit to the planning phase and change your movements and start over.How is this game tactical ?Well, the RPS 'Best Tactics of 2014' says for itself.Not enough, aye ?Fine. Door Kickers is one of those games that shines during situations where you can't just go guns blazing.For example,there is a hostage taker standing right behind the hostage facing toward the only entry point of the room.Now, being the Top Down game that Door Kickers is, there is no third dimension so when your team step into the room, the hostage taker will open fire and hit the hostage before he hits you.So what do you do ?1. Bang the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... I meant a flashbang. Blind him so your team has time to move around and neutralise him without harming the hostage2. If there is a window, you can send a trooper to flank him from a different angle.Multiple ways to problem solve, is it enough evidence that this game is tactical ?No ?Well, the game has different kinds of situations that you have to adapt to, such as- Eliminate Hostiles : It's basically Terrorist Hunt. Go in, kill all the baddies, win.- Hostage Rescue : It's just like Terrorist Hunt, but with Hostages in it. Possibility of an Execution though.- Stop Execution : A baddie in the area is about to blow the brains out of someone and you have to stop them.- Bomb Defusal : Well, the name says it all.- Dope Raid : Recover evidence mainly dope, and dope papers.- Warrant Arrest : Again, name says it all.- Protect VIP : ... I don't really have to describe this one at all, do I ?- Robbery in Progress : Somehow, the devs know how lazy I get when I need to describe things.What ? Still not enough ? Are you kidding me...Fine.The game has an arsenal of trooper classes, weapons, and equipment to outfit your team to suit the situationClasses include (If you haven't seen the video above)- Pointman : Only armed with a pistol, has the highest mobility and is the fastest during entry, but isn't the best at range- Assaulter : Guy with the guns. Basically, guy that shoots all the baddies for you.- Breacher : As the name implies, he breaches door ways, clear rooms, and corridors in hasty manner. I like to call him ""Hobo with a Shotgun""- Shield : The guy that you would want to bring when the baddies bring their big guns.- Stealth : Shhhh... I'm trying to think of a description for this one... Damn it, keep quiet! I'm trying to think!Weapons range from simple submachine guns such as the MP5A3 to meaner rifles like the G36C to a punch in the face like the Mossberg 590.Sidearms ? No problem! Glocks, 1911s, and P226s, anything is in store! Just need to trade in your gold stars!Oh, we got loads of equipments, Flashbang, Breaching Charges, Tasers, even a little handheld machine that allows you to picklock faster!So as you can see, this game is completely tacticool...WHAT? NOT ENOUGH!? Bruh, I'm done. I got nothing else. You can go watch them YouTube videos and find them all out on your own. I ain't gonna tell you everything man.Oh, but you want the know the truth !? YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.Anyways, I love this game. One of my favourite games, as you can see, spent over 100 hours on this thing.If I could rename my girlfriend, I would name her ""Window Smashers"".Thank you for reading my Review. It's probably too long, but heck. At least I got it out there, right ?			"

Early Access Review
								Door Kickers is one of the most extreme tactical SWAT games I have ever played. It offers hugely evolving gameplay and a load of weapon combinations to suit your playstyle. You will be able to use armories from multiple countries (Germany, France, UK, US, etc.) and also have different forms of each weapon (Silences, or non-silenced) for you to be able to in stealthily or blow your way into the enemy lines. You will also have the option of creativity as each time you do a mission you will want a new strategy, and it allows you to have multiple ways of getting into a room, from pick-locking a door to blowing it down with C4 or shottgunning the lock. You will also enjoy the challenging gameplay of only having a limited amount of men and will likely be outnumbered, forcing you to strategize and plan instead of rushing them like it's a Third-person shooter.Also note this game is being created by a small, indie team. So you will not get updates every other day, but it seems so far they have been having extremely large updates every two weeks, which likely means they love there buyers so much they are over working themselves.If you have the money, and enjoy planning and then watching your men burst in and dominate the enemy or have one thing go wrong and watch your team get slaughtered, then buy the game. It's fairly cheap and really innovative to the market, it's also in early access so there is so much more to come and it's completely playable and almost bug free in its current state. "

												I couldn't expect something amazing due to tons of mediocre indie-games nowdays, but this one, GOD...9.5/10Pros:- music is just brilliant = 40% of whole atmosphere (like Payday 1/2)- very rich tactics- really fast and smooth client- simultaneously shutting down 4 enemies by 4 troopers spawns huge 0rgasm. Sadly, this is not a joke :(- tons of missions and ways to complete them. I mean, TONS- slick and easy UI- mods support- mission generator + built-in mission maker + possibility to share it- this is how every Warhammer40k tactical game should look like, just change the skin and you got mindbreaking legendary crusadeCons:- lack of narrative briefing for missions like story, characters and intrigue (remembering Gunpoint), just short descriptions- when multiple troopers paths are crossed it is becomes too hard to micro-command like look there, step here- RNG sometimes looks weird, like one try you one-shot everything and another one you're wasting whole magazine for one guy- sometimes your troopers AI just stuck stopping your unit before some doors- I know this is not the core, but I guess with some gorgeous graphics engine it would look just marvellous. Anyway, these guys did so amazing game, it's just very good VS best.Verdict:It was long time ago since I was so satisfied with some game. For tactics genre this title has everything, this is how small team stomps most of AAA brands.			"

												* 5 Trooper Classes plus Sniper (Mission Dependent)* 70+ Weapons and Gear Items* Six Campaigns (Perma-death)* 80 Independent Missions* Viewable Replays* Global and Individual Stat Tracking* Cross Platform Import/Export Saves* Mission Generator* Level Editor* Steam Workshop* 43 Achievements* 8 Different Trading Cards* No SympathyDoor Kickers harks back to a time when gamers were thought to be intelligent. A little bit of information is given to the player about gameplay mechanics and the rest is left up to them to figure out through trial and error. This, in part, is why there's no ""do it this way to win"" approach to informing the player. Inspired by the planning stages of Rainbow Six, with a SWAT aesthetic, and turned into a feature length game, it all makes sense. A player must learn to play the game much like they must learn to understand how to deal with the situation in which their troopers find themselves. Or be left to suffer the consequences. Although it's possible to make arrests and to subdue assailants with a taser, that's not where the emphasis lies. The opponents you're dealing with are all presumed to be heavily armed and willing to kill you on site based on the knowledge that they most likely already have. Once you understand that, the gear and equipment options available in-game will make a lot more sense. That is why this game is more comparable to Rainbow Six than Swat 3 or 4. It's not about getting a conviction but dishing out the punishment because the verdict has already been made.I highly recommend this game. But that recommendation entirely depends on the type of gamer you are. This game is for the thinker. Sometimes you'll make a plan that will take a few seconds and so will the mission. Other times, you'll spend a few hours only for the mission to fail. It's not the game's fault, nor is it yours. That's just a harsh reality and simply a matter of learning from such mistakes. If you want mindless satisfaction, are looking for a game that plays itself, or were born yesterday, this is not the game for you. This game is a challenge, your enjoyment will entirely depend on whether or not you'll accept it as such and rise to the occasion. So the question is: do you accept the challenge?			"

												Doorkickers is a 2D, Top Down tactical strategy game with real-time and pause. This title has been on my radar for a very long time and I decided to pick it up during summersale. Now I have finally played it and I have to say that it's great!If you enjoy games like Xcom you will most likely have fun with doorkickers, or if you have an interest in swat games and tactics planning. This game have so many levels and challenges you can complete. Also there's a story, although it felt just like the normal quick games I would say. You can also create your own maps and download others for unlimited fun! Save hostages, kill bad guys and capture wanted criminals. Its intense at times but it's always fun to play!Doorkickers comes with all the neat steam features like achievement, steam cloud, etc. Game runs well and you have a good options menu. You level up your soldiers in game and unlock new classes and weapons.This game is great and I would strongly recommend everyone to at least try it out at some point. This is one of the only good games that came out of early access!			"

												This game is top notch! If you loved the Rainbow Six series and SWAT 4, you'll probably love this even more. Fan of RTS and action games, you must give this one a shot. This is basically one of those games where it gets better and better as you get used to the mechanics and unlock new stuff.Door Kickers is a tactical RTS game where you take control of a SWAT team and save the day through hostage rescue missions, bomb defusal missions, VIP escorts and everything else a SWAT-based game should have. The game can be played either by planning everything at the start of a level and watch as the team executes your orders (Rainbow Six style) or by taking control of your units in real-time. You can also do both, since the action can be paused at any time (recommended for starters).PROS+ Tactical SWAT gameplay at its finest. Assign equipment to each unit, plan and execute any way you want; easy to pick up and play.+ Many guns to choose from and different classes each with their own advantages and disadvantages.+ Very high replayability: lots of individual and varied missions, campaigns, map editor, random mission generator and great mod support.+ Awesome soundtrack and clean graphics that match the atmosphere of the game.+ Still gets updated with additional free content and bug fixes.CONS- Slightly frustrating at times- Some Workshop mods may be incompatible because of the new updates.Personal rating: 9/10 "

												Pros+solid gameplay+passable sound effects+good level design, and distinguishable terrain. You won't get confused as to what's what. Very useful for this type of game+Ability to plan out the execution of an entire mission, and watch your men methodically carry it out in seconds.+Ai works well at following said plan  +Customization: Lots of gear to choose from and unlock.+Level designer/randomizer: Unlimited replayabilityCons- A little bit pricey for my taste. I prefer $10-15 at most for an indie game of this quality- Still a few bugs to iron out- Can get hard to plan moves for your last member on your team, as the order lines stack up Techical issues-Can't seem to plan my men to swap their weapons twice during the planning phase. I can tell my men at a certain point to pull out their secondaries, but I'm unable to tell them to swap back. I have to wait till they actually change weapons to order them swap back at a later time. Can be annoying when trying to unlock achievements for each level.-Unable to hide other units command lines during planning phase. When you have commands issued for a large amount of soldiers, it looks like pasta all over the place. Can make it very hard to issue orders to the last soldier on your squad. -Sometimes I want to order a certain swat member to throw a flash bang through a door, but a nearby teamate stacked on the door recieves the order instead. The game needs a toggle function for ordering stacked teamates to do something instead of the default choice. -When cancelling a command, it sometimes does not dissapear, making you have to backtrack your soldiers moves a good bit to fix it, or restart them completely.Rating: 8.5/10===========Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Sound effects: 7/10Ai: 9/10Replayability: 10/10 "

												it's pretty obvious that the best way to kill terrorists is by kicking doors down. they get real scared by that stuff. following on from that, door kickers is a game where you kick doors down and then save hostages/clear houses of terrorists. I am being unnecessarily facetious here, it's a really fun game but it's really difficult as well. if you like XCOM and stuff then you'll enjoy this game. also this game is better than real life because my mum and dad only let me open and close doors, not kick em or blow them up. life sucks huh.

Product received for free
												I got this game as a birthday present from a distant friend. He knew my passion for strategy and planning.It is hard to add to the many other positive reviews. On the plus side, this game is well-thought, simple, and yet it allows for various degrees of sophistication. In particular, I like the opportunity to try different gaming styles (planner, aggressive, solo, non-lethal, etc.). This adds to a high degree of replayability, with achievements that will satisfy all the min-maxers around the globe. Another praiseworthy feature is the possibilty to download further content, both official and user-generated.On the aesthetic side, scenarios are pleasing to the eye and graphics are detailed without overworking the engine (as it is expected in such 2D map games).I didn't really like the star system, becaue it rewards timekeepers over perfectionists. Moreover, it makes it very easy to access powerful gear very early in the game, but apparently that's also true for real life: some of the most effective guns in the world are not the most expensive, and have been around for ages. Random mission generator is a bit boring, though, and this game's strength are the campaign and official missions, each of them with their own peculiarity (storming the embassy, freeing a cruise ship, boarding a plane, etc.). In my version of the game I miss a ""shuffle"" button for randomly generated maps: this means I have to enter and exit the menu to generate new keys and new scenarios. Finally, although background audio effects are interesting at first, they become repetitive quite soon.Overall, my judgement is more than positive, because the pros clearly outweight the few cons of the game. My congratulations to all developers, artist, and producers for such a neat product. Also, a big thank you to Texisthelex for having sent me this gift.			"

								This game is ♥♥♥♥ing sick. The gameplay is smooth and the actions percise. This game is a great way to teach people to watch their sectors at all times and to stay alert. Using real world tactics in this game does actually benefit and it makes you look even more badass in the replays. Even in alpha I find this addictive and fun and the editor and generator is a great way to extend replayability. Keep up the good work devs.			"

Early Access Review
								Door Kickers is a great game and has the makings of a great CQB training aid.  The survival of your officers is heavily based on your ability to control your tactical angles.  Real tactics, techniques, and procedures work (for the most part).  As an added bonus, you can create videos of your playthroughs, which you can then edit and use it to help train your team, whether it be a video game clan, paintball, airsoft, or even actual military and law enforcement.  By having a clear display of each officer's field of view, you can accurately portray sectors of fire and emphasize an understanding of the importance of angles.  Add to this that you can create your own levels with nothing more than some photo editing software, and you have the ability to create any training aid or game level you wish, complex or simple.Currently, this game is in Alpha.   Right now, the game has a feel of many Android or Apple games, with a bunch of sequentially harder scenarios that you attempt to earn three stars on.  Time is the primary factor for achieving the three stars, which is somewhat counter to how a SWAT team actually acts.  Slow and safe is often preferred to fast and loose.  Things have gotten a bit deeper as the game has progressed through its Alpha stage, with the addition of different classes, levels of armor, rank progression of your officers, and training unlocks.  Updates have come at a very steady pace, and have consistantly added new great features that make me happy I bought the game.This game can be as simple or as complex as you want to make it.  Do you want to intricately plan out your entire team's movement with go codes and then press play and see what happens?  Or do you want to work through the scenario as it plays out, pausing and unpausing to make changes on the fly or control an officer's field of fire directly?  Either way works, and it's up to you.This game is so much fun.  You can run through a quick scenario to get your fix, or you can try for the best score on a hard level for hours.  With new scenarios being added constantly by the community, and the ability to create random missions from any map, you have an endless amount of replay value.			"

YouTube™ Video: Door Kickers Review 

			Views: 1,101		

			We take a look at the tactical real time strategy game Door Kickers. http://noobsthatplaygames.com/		

Door Kickers is a very interesting top down tactical real time strategy game where you control a team of SWAT agents with the task of eliminating groups of terrorists who are held up in a variety of increasingly difficult and hostile scenarios. The game offers a large amount of depth and content with fully customizable SWAT team, weapons, gear, and classes. The game shines in the planning stage where you are put in control of laying out the exact movements and actions of each SWAT agent, choose whether to go in guns blazing and blast down the door, or take a more stealthy approach and use spy cams to monitor your enemy’s movements before entering. You can take as many or as few times as you wish to pause the game on the fly mid action and adjust your plans to adapt to the hectic battlefield that unfolds as your agents press forward into the enemies territory; however, by far the most satisfying and rewarding part of the game is when you preplan and successfully defeat all the enemies in single attempt without pausing to adjust. The game has a very satisfying level of difficulty that will definitely force you to retry missions multiple times until you learn from your mistakes, which at times may feel frustrating due to the varying random difficulty spikes that you will encounter, but this only adds more to the level of satisfaction you will feel when you successfully complete the mission. Upon completion of a mission you are scored by a 3 star system that varies based on your performance, the stars you earn are then used as the currency to upgrade your gear and purchase new weapons. The game features a ton of playable content, offering tons of levels to play in single player, campaign, and both a level and mission editor to create your own levels and share them via Steam Workshop Mods. The game offers an incredibly high amount of content and depth with a very high replay-ability value, the game is truly an indie gem that has done an excellent job at captivating the feel from the Rainbow Six series and bringing it to 2014. http://noobsthatplaygames.com/ "

												A hostage crisis in the suburbs. The troopers move up to the entrance cautiously, wary of potential threats in the vicinity.You stack up against the door. Your teammate moves to the front, his Kimber drawn. You have the advantage of marksmanship, training and skill and you both know it. But you are still up against many.You take a deep breath and blast off the door handle with your Mossberg. the door swings open and your teammate fires 3 well placed shots. A body hits the ground.""THE COPS ARE HERE"" rings down the hallway and you hear the mulitple doors opening and closing.Your heart pounds furiously.No time or chance to back down, and you charge into the lion's den, sending the first hostile you see down with a single blast of 00.Simply put, this game is like Rainbow Six from a real-time-strategy/top-down perspective, where you control SWAT troopers as they conduct raids against criminals and terrorists.Each game is highly lethal, and most demand a certain time limit to be met, most of which happens to be a minute or two. Every move you take requires very careful planning.Is there a blind spot unaccounted for?Is there someone covering me?Is someone's line of sight blocked by another, possibly endangering both?Your operators are well trained and will easily take down multiple hostiles at once, but they aren't God. A single fatal mistake in planning or an unprecendented move by a hostile will more often than not lead to their swift and violent demise, whether it's a burst of MAC-10 fire from the side or single 7.62mm round from a AK-47.In a game where every second counts you have to get used to controlling every operator at any point in time. Watching flanks, breaching rooms, using tactical manoeuvres to clear, all have to be done in a single fluid motion. On drug busting operations prepare to launch a 6 man offensive on an entire port, where you have to simultaneously control all your fireteams and keep them alive, and secure the evidence before the cartel gets a chance to destroy it.Your classes are clearly defined. The Pointman, who is extremely mobile and deadly in tight spaces but will easily get swamped by numbers. The Assault, who can both be a close quarter fire-hose with a submachine gun for laying accurate and well controlled bursts or a mid-range specialist with an assault rifle, dishing out accurate semi automatic fire that stops people in their tracks, but lose your close range mobility and versatility.The Breacher who can blast doors open and engage multiple enemies with buckshot but quickly get outgunned at mid-ranges and risk collateral damage from the pellet spread.The Stealth who are good mid range specialists who will put hostiles to sleep silently but will lose their edge in closer engagements.The Shield who can block most incoming shots but can only use a pistol and may not have the mobility in close spaces or the accuracy for long escort missions.Skill is required to make the best out of every trooper you train for every situation and make sure everyone comes out alive.You spend more time planning alone than executing, and you will get frustrated sometimes from the frequent restarting but every completed mission grants a never-ending sense of pride.PROS:1. Excellent AI. Troopers are not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and will react to defend themselves and hostiles will actively flank and investigate sources of noise.2. Tight map design that pose a challenge to players3. Customisation is well-controlled and delivered with a clear focus on maximising the trooper's usability on the field over the simple mindless pimp-your-gun-to-be-special attachment chucking we see in many other games4. Price. I got this on sale for a measly 3 bucks and it's been worth every penny.5. Comprehensive controls and a decent How-to guide for quickly jumping in.6. Minimalistic UI that tells you what you need and what you need alone and great graphics.7. Immersive atmosphere that gets your heart pumping every time a raid is initiated and keeps you coming back for more.8. A decent bare-bones progression system that rewards you with better troop quality for future raids but doesn't go as far as to become a grindfest.9. As if the above aren't enough there is workshop content with plenty of diversity. Want a new scenario? Try a pirate ship raid. Want to satisfy your gun fetish? Get mods that increase the number of weapons available at your disposal.CONS:1. An unforgiving currency (star) system that renders you in a tight spot if you make a costly mistake in your investment, where you potentially lose the ability to progress yet are unable to earn more to buy the gear you need.

Early Access Review
								Door Kickers is a Indie, Simulation, and Strategy game developed by the folks over at Killhouse Games. It was added to steam on September 3rd, 2013. The game features a mix of real time strategy with a tactical stop and go pause mode that allows you to analyze situations, and make your plans for each map. There is a small amount of customization in the current build of the game but that is simply due to the early access nature of the game. The gameplay is pretty great, however it can be rage inducing at times. The main idea is to kill the bad guys and have at least one of your own team mates left standing at the end. In some cases there are hostages to rescue which can put a timer on the level. All the levels can be completed in a small time window . Ultimately you want to play a level as fast as possible with little to no casualties. The game is a early access game and thus has many features missing. With that said the game is great as it is right now. Of course a few flaws that I’m not sure are bugs or overlooked design. For example there are times when I open a door and my character is looking directly at a person and will mow them and 3 other people down without being shot. Then there are times where the same guy will open the door and sing love songs to the enemies and thus getting domed (shot in the mother♥♥♥♥ing skull). It feels like r.n.g and less bug but who am I to say. This was the only real issue I had with the game. Especialy on the one level at the beach where I had one guy left, and there was one enemy left. My guy opens the door to the bathroom and both the ai and my character stand their in a stand off for about fifteen seconds before the ai shoots my guy in the face…..The levels can be played in many ways, the best is just to find a style that suits you. For most of my levels I set a path for my guys to run and it worked. I very rarely had to pause the game after my initial plan. However if you want you can breach doors. After breaching a room, you can pause the room to setup what to do next. The breaching, and or DOOR KICKING is the core of the game. You have several ways to breach. You can just kick a door in and hope your guys don’t get blasted before they can see through the door. You can also breach with a flashbang where they open a door and throw a flashbang in. Again however if your guy is standing directly infront of the door you risk getting shot and killed so it is best to do it from the side. Then there is the breaching charge where you setup a charge on the door and can detonate it. This stuns most of the people in the room giving you an advantage. You can also use a snake cam to see under the doors. The game has no multiplayer but the developers say it MIGHT come later. The game also has a mission editor , however I did not play around with that yet. It does mean the game will have many mods and games with mods are always better because of it! The game as single player is a lot of fun and I definitely suggest anyone who likes tactical strategy games to make this purchase. The game is worth every god damn dime. As far as early access games go this is one of the better ones on steam. I will of course do a re-review of the game upon full release of the game. You want a score don’t you? WELL F&CK YOU! … No seriously here is my score for the early access of Door Kickers. Door Kickers gets a Drastik Measure 8.2 (82)			"

												Started playing Nov 2015.Easy to pick-up and play, very difficult to master. I was not expecting so many missions and so many weapon choices, its very impressive. Its fun taking different approaches to missions and the good kind of trail & error towards finishing each level. Eventually you may become good enough to beat any level in just the planning stage, before it has played out in real time. Its a great accomplishment.Some missions require a bit of luck, and occasionally death/failure feels cheap. But you can always make your own missions if you get sick of the hundreds of dev made levels and campaigns.			"

												I'll admit, I haven't gotten very far, but the bit of it I did play was exceptionally good for what its supposed to be. The controls do seem to be a bit difficult to master, but at least for the simple mechanics, you do catch on quickly.The action is quite tactical, no nonsense. I definitely get the feeling that there is an incredible amount of depth in the game, and already I'm looking forward to playing again.The built in mod-ability and mission generation, combined with the fact that the game is built around its solid mechanics (rather than any sort of linear narrative) seems to ensure that the ""dollars spent"":""hours of fun"" ratio is quite favorable.

 < Disclaimer!! I got this game for free for reviewing purposes > A tactical strategy game that you can play in 2 modes, Real-Time or Planning Mode ( Kinda like transistor ) and kicking doors never been so funThe game has a very large set of levels and its possibly endless, Around 80+ levels on Single Missions, And Also a lot of levels On campaign mode, And a lot of community created maps (Via level editor) And Theres also a Random Mission Generator which is really cool!.you choose the map size the scenario and the difficulty, so yeah I meant it when I said Endless...But the fun does not last that long well it depends on your taste, gonna get to this in a moment.You can customize every Swat member of yours, changing their gear and what not, Changing from assaulter to breacher and stealth or point-man Pistols, or pistols+rifles or shotguns or swat shield...etc.Fun to use equipment's, such as a spy-cam to peak through a door and you move it left or right, or a breaching charge to plant on a door and blow it up to knockdown/kill enemies, And of course flash bangs, Stingers and more.On each level you get stars which you can use to unlock more Equipment's , Stronger/heavier shields or armors or weapons just an example.I really like the game control, You can assign your units to ( A(alpha) B(Beta) C(Charlie) D(Delta) ) And assign plans to each which they will execute after you press the assigned button on UI or keyboard, Really good to coordinate your unit movements ( Shields first, snipers last) and execute the perfect plan which takes some serious thinking.At some levels you also get a sniper that auto-locks on targets on your sight, You can press Tab to order him to switch to another target and S to take the shot.The enemy responds are pretty clever, they don't just mess around, you'd usually need to flashbang them or flank them or use any method to distract them to avoid allied losses.The game music is very good and gives you the mood to focus on your plans, or pumps you up to go break sh*t and kill everyone.Game levels are pretty great, Although there are a lot of levels you don't see them getting repeated.Game difficulty is pretty hard, And keeps getting harder as you go on.Single Mission Mode, Is a set of 80+ levels that you play each with its mission and different level layout, You could skip the first ones and jump to the last.Campaign mode, Has no story its just a set of levels that you keep on playing with limited swat units, when you finish a level with some causalities they don't come back in the next level so you have to be careful and usually restart when they die, Around 5 Campaigns each is about 4 to 9 Levels, with completely different layouts, It also has the caption ( More to come ) so thats good I guess, they want to add more.Leveling up your squad to the next level gets you access to the next Class ( Which I mentioned earlier the Stealth or Breacher .. etc ) Apparently there are (Doctrines) points that you get awarded by leveling up your squad level, And use them in a Skill-Tree to give you more abilities and accuracy and more.Of-course you level up by receiving the exp award at the end of every level.The game has a lot of achievements, At first they are easy to obtain but the later ones are pure hell this is fun for grinders.Level editor is easy to use, And power it with your imagination, Create a hostage rescue, Annihilation, DrugBust, Arrest, Robbery, Vip Secure, Stop the execution And of-course Defuse the bomb.2 mods that already exists that adds some levels and a few stuff ( Christmas mod, Template mod )  The Other SideSo now after all the good has been said let me tell you about the other side.Although the game is really good it has its own fair share of cons.Sometimes my units becomes dull and throws the bomb although I specifically stopped the action by pressing the delete icon, and sometimes they also become very slow to react when an enemy appear that i'v been waiting for, takes them time to take the shot and sometimes they'd kill my units before they even reacted to seeing them, I don't know if this is how the game wants it to be just saying.I really dislike it when a unit throws a Bomb it has to wait before making a move, I understand that's how it works in reality but most of the time the delay backfires because it reaches them after the effect of the Flash-bang wore off, and it goes there to die.Some levels are fairly hard and others are insanely unfair and frustrating, reach the point where you just keep on doing it again and again and again and going full-throttle until your units mans up and takes the shot accurately and miraculously you win.Reason why I said ( Apparently there are doctrine points ) Its because I saw it the first time I launched the game but forgotten about it, And the game has no hints or anything to show me or remind me to use it in main-menu, I was missing around my rank and accidentally saw it lol... Which brings me to the next point.Lack of tutorials, I don't mind this but if you are the type that wont go without them just a heads-up (There is a how to play guide)Units becomes stupid when they collide with each other, they just stop and do not perform their next action instead of turning around the unit or object.There is a bugged level in campaign which made it impossible to me to finish the 2nd one ( so I skipped to the next one ) In which a mission where I'm supposed to secure the VIP and bring him back to the safe zone, And usually killing all hostiles gets the job done and leaving no need to get the hostages but this one required it, So I go set next to him so he'd follow me but he never did, Played it around 9 times already and never got to finish it....was incredibly frustrating.LIKE I mentioned at the beginning of the review after a while the game may gets boring depends on your taste.As for me after around 7 hours I started getting really bored, Although the game has a lot of different levels, The feeling stays the same, Be careful and quick to finish the mission blah blah, Gets a bit boring in my own opinion, They should'v made a way to spice it up with more challenges and stuff, Again thats just me, There are people who played this for over 25+ hours and did not complain at all.If you don't want to read all that PROS : 1 - Tactical-type game that requires strategy and thinking, Difficult but fun.2 - A lot of levels to play, And a random mission generator, Campaigns and Community Maps.3 - A lot of Weapons, Utilities (Gadgets) And support gear to unlock.4 - Customizing every unit in every mission to make it best suitable for the current level.5 - A lot of achievements to grind on, Trading cards and Steam-Cloud.6 - Great game music and sound effects, gets that thinking mode of yours pumping.CONS : 1 - Sometimes it gets kinda frustrating on how some levels are ridiculously difficult compared to later ones.2 - A few clunkiness in character movements colliding with each other and slow reactions in some cases.3 - A few bugs I found on certain levels which made some impossible to finish and the rest just 10 times harder.Also something I really liked about the game.The terrorists are not portrayed as Arabs, They always make terrorists in video games to look and sound like Arabs *cough*Cs*Cough* and more games ... It frustrates me makes me feel discriminated against sometimes although i love those games, BUT it was really refreshing and nice to see a game that made a different approach.TL;DRA game for the tactical shooter fans, definitely worth its full price, Hard as HELL and takes some LONG♥♥♥♥♥time to complete, and even longer to 100%, And to get all the level ups and unlock everything, i'd say 30+ hours.Very fun game Although this review might not show it but I enjoyed it a lot 8/10			"

												This is strategy at its core! The tactical options are amazing while the controls are kept fairly simple as opposed to, say, Frozen Synapse. I think it cuts all the necessary clutter for this to be on of the best tactical games of recent times, and the power you feel while your masterplan unfolds is tremendous. Fan of any tactical games, Rainbow Sixes, SWATs or the like? Play this!			"

												Best tactics in 2014 for a reason. Recommended and gifted by a ""friend"" of mine (Nanamil) in return for all my collected Friendship tokens. It's a simple but challenging game from the topdown perspective in wich you take the role of a squad leader guiding a good amount of S.W.A.T's through an almost endless amount of levels (thanks to Steam's Workshop)- each one different in artstyle, size, and possible ways to accomplish the goal.""But whats the goal?"" you might ask now and I dont even feel ashamed saying that its cliche Counter -Terrorist missions such as bomb defusal, hostage rescuing, eliminating all hostiles etc... But in this game it feels more satisfying than in most games that tried to be tactical or stealth in the past few years (no matter if Topdown, Fps, Third-person ) and thats why I can highly recommend it to a wide range of gamers...those who love Real-Time-Strategy but also those who love stealth or action in general. Its some of the best games for a quick casual ""turn-your-head-off"" after work / school and kills all the boredom. And for me it's just even more motivation that most achievments are more of rewards for actually good playing rather than grinding and more grinding and more grinding... Since I believe this game could run on ANY PC out there you dont need to worry about your Rig...just enjoy it if you like ~5 bucks for many hours of fun seems like a good deal, eh? :P "

												Cops & Robbers is one of the all-time classic games of make-believe; the eternal battle between good and evil, played out in every playground for generations. And it doesn't stop there – we grow up, but the primal attraction of that conflict never leaves us, and we replace pointed fingers and 'pew pew' noises with films, books, and video games.Door Kickers is one of those video games. Developed by KillHouse Games, its top-down tactics and emphasis on planning invite comparisons to those games that have best captured the sense of modern day Cops & Robbers; the SWAT series, and Rainbow Six, before Vegas went and ruined everything. It's been in Early Access for quite a while, but has seen a great deal of community feedback and development as a result. Now that it's reached full release status, how does it hold up against its peers?Be under no illusions – this is no arcade-style run & gun. Door Kickers lets you plan an entire mission in advance and, once the action gets going, you have free use of the pause feature to adjust things on-the-fly. Don't think this makes things easy though – this is a brutally difficult game from the very start, and will not tolerate the impatient or imprecise. You may be in command of a highly-trained squad of police officers, but you're never more than one forgotten corner, or one misplaced order away from an abrupt, messy death, and a mission restart. This is a game that teaches the player with quick but violent lessons; assume there are enemies everywhere, move cautiously using cover, and always, always check those corners.Things aren't helped by the often questionable AI of your officers. I often found them spotting an enemy, but then ignoring them – sometimes turning their backs on them entirely, and necessitating my manual intervention to force them to engage. This isn't a novel problem; in Frozen Synapse, if you want a unit to forget about enemies and just hustle, you must specifically order that unit to ignore threats. Here, though, you must specify if you want an officer to wait until there are no living enemies. When gun-toting criminals can ruin your day in seconds, it just feels like the wrong way around.When it does go right, though, it's a fantastic experience; an orgy of meticulously-executed violence, taking place in mere seconds. I rarely make use of replay features in games, but here I found myself re-watching successful missions just to bask in the glory of the perfect plan.Rather than giving you a random bunch of men for each mission, Door Kickers gives you a permanent squad, with each officer earning their own experience points. Customisation is surprisingly comprehensive, allowing you to change the name, appearance, and loadout of each member of the team. Initially, the selection of equipment is limited, but you can unlock more by playing through missions and earning points. Many of the missions, especially later ones, are simply too difficult without equipment upgrades, so there's a strong incentive to perfect the early scenarios and gear up as much as possible. Successful missions also earn 'doctrine points,' which you can spend on skill upgrades which apply to everyone in your team – these cover things like accuracy improvements, and new tactics. Sadly, while doctrine points can be re-specced, there's no way to 'buy back' points spent on equipment. This is especially frustrating given that grinding missions does not earn you more points – there are a maximum of 3 points to be earned, total, in any scenario. If you buy some gear and then realise you need something else for a later mission, you're stuffed.Missions are split into three campaigns and a huge selection of standalone scenarios. In practice, the campaigns are little more than several missions strung together, offering no real plot, but with the added difficulty of dead officers staying dead for the duration of the campaign, so you'll want to play it safe with your best troopers.The missions themselves vary from basic room-to-room clearing, through hostage-rescue or bomb-defusal scenarios, to the excellent drug busts, in which you must collect evidence while enemies scramble to destroy it. There's also a competent random mission generator, and a robust level editor with Steam Workshop support, in case you exhaust the 100+ levels on offer, so replayability is a big draw.Once you get into a mission, the big draw of Door Kickers is the planning interface. A much-loved feature of classic tactical games, it allows you to plan – in theory – an entire mission in advance. Then it's just a matter of hitting play and watching your squad do the dirty work. In practice, once you're past the first two or three missions, it's almost impossible to do the whole thing in one go if you want to prevent the wholesale slaughter of your hapless officers. In particular, it's impossible to use the 'magic wand' (a camera on a stick) in an automated plan, since it requires manual control to scan a room – never mind the fact that you inexplicably can't use it to peek around corners.Between the enjoyable gameplay, appealing visuals, and the return of mission planning, it's difficult not to recommend Door Kickers to anyone with enough patience to tolerate the difficulty curve.

												In the search for the ideal top-down tactical shooter, I've tried Hotline Miami (too twitchy), Forzen Synapse (too random), Monaco (close, but too gimmicky), and recent XCOMs (on the abstract side). None of them quite scratch the itch created by Julian Gollop games. Until Door Kickers.The heart of the game is a series of buildings your SWAT team must clear of bad guys. Sometimes there's another objective such rescuing hostages or collecting evidence before the suspects can destroy it. These require various tactics and give the game flavor. But the core remains moving from one room to the next shooting people who are trying to shoot you.Every character possesses some level of agency. Enemies (AKA, tangos) respond to sounds and other cues in reasonable ways. For instance, they might turn to face the door your pointman is forcing. Alternatively, they might decide to shoot the hostages or destroy the evidence. Your operators might ignore orders in order to respond to immediate threats. In fact, you don't order them to fire at all; you tell them where to go and they just take care of business.As a result, you can set up a plan at the start of a level and let the game play itself. I know that sounds boring, but it really isn't. Plans involve dozens of little decisions, such as how to breach a door, where to toss a flashbang, when to turn to check a hallway and so on. You can charge though most levels with a lone shooter (there are achievements for it) or carefully coordinate a full team with go signals. If your plan works, the payoff is a minute or two of perfectly choreographed violence.Truthfully, however, perfect planning doesn't happen the first time around. More often I need to adjust because I failed check a blind spot or I blundered into shotgun crossfire. Plans can be redrawn on the fly or you can pause the action to give yourself time to think. Immediately after completion of a level, I find myself restarting it so that I can fine tune the plan.There is an overarching game of unlocking tactics, roles and armament. Faster times unlock up to three stars for buying new guns, body armor and equipment. Officers earn experience points which open up new roles (assaulter, breacher, stealth and shield) and tactics. Missions can technically be played in any order, but the effect of the leveling system is to gate off more difficult levels. Skipping missions or forgetting to upgrade increases the challenge quickly.On the other hand, once you have a stronger team, it's rewarding to go back to earlier levels and get an improved result. In addition, campaigns are unlocked once your squad levels up to a certain point. However, don't think of campaigns as stories since they are just missions strung together to force you to pay the consequences for deaths and injuries. I'd complain campaigns are too shallow if I weren't excited to play new maps.Not that there's any lack of maps. In addition to 84 single missions and 6 campaigns, there are user-created missions for download and a map generator. These mean you will never need to play the same mission over again, but they also highlight the skill of official level designers. Levels designed by other users are wildly inconstant in challenge and quality. The generated levels can be anywhere from boring to near impossible depending on which settings you use and how the random number generator rolls.In the final analysis, Door Kickers provides copious amounts of tactical decision making with simple controls and plenty of chrome.

One of the best real-time tactics games on Steam.Having finished all of the single missions and all of the campaigns, both in Normal and in Iron Man, I believe I'm in a position to write a few things about this game. I don't usually write Steam reviews, but Door Kickers is a special game that deserves recommendation. As someone who is very interested in tactical gaming, the top-down tactics offered by this game are very enjoyable.The game gives you control over a team of SWAT operators and tasks you with defeating the bad guys and completing missions such as rescuing hostages, arresting a suspect, securing evidence, preventing escape of the suspects or escorting a VIP. There are different ways to play the game, but the way I play it (and I guess the most obvious style of play) is real-time with pause. The way I usually do the missions is like this: I draw actions for my troopers, let them play out those actions, pause, assess the situation and then plan my next move. You can also play the game in 100% real-time or even prepare the entire mission in the planning phase if you want. It's a lot more difficult and challenging to do, but the option is there. There is no 'true' method of playing the game.It's a challenging game. The guns are deadly. That goes both ways. If you don't want any of your troopers to get killed in one or two shots, you better make sure that you watch your sectors and assume that there is danger around every corner. The game mercilessly punishes you for your mistakes, but the rules are fair and if you lose a trooper it's almost always due to your own mistake.Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be given to Door Kickers is the fact that a number of real-life tactics can be applied to it, and that these are often the most effective. The best way to clear a simple room is the way real operators often do it: stack your troopers near the door, open or breach it, throw a flashbang (tip: use them excessively), enter the room, establish points of domination along the nearest wall(s) and let your troopers shoot all of the bad guys in their own respective sector. Take a look at the top-down illustrations in this military field manual[www.globalsecurity.org]. Some of the tactics that are shown in that chapter actually work in Door Kickers. That is an impressive feat, and it highlights the developer's understanding of real-world CQC fights and tactics. Because of this, Door Kickers is arguably one of the more realistic small-scale tactics games there are.It's not without flaws. From time to time, your troopers will make a stupid mistake which may get one of them killed, such as when they accidentally throw a grenade against the wall instead of into the room. And they cannot perform certain basic tasks like leaning and crouching, though that might have been a design decision. But overall, the controls are very fleshed out and the game is very enjoyable to play as is. It allows a certain degree of freedom in how to approach each situation: your stealth approach doesn't work? Kit out your team with harder-hitting assault rifles. Can't prevent a hostage execution in time? Try a different route or be more aggressive. Having a lot of trouble eliminating an armoured tango? Invest in one of the guns that offer better armour penetration. Or just throw more flashbangs. More flashbangs are always good. Some of the equipment that works in certain situations will not work in other situations, and vice-versa. All of the equipment in the game has utility, although some are more useful than others.Pros: Real-world room clearing fundamentals work (at least some of them). Deadly guns; challenging. Different ways to play. Plenty of content: at the time of writing 84 official missions and 6 campaigns, Iron Man mode, a level editor, mod support and fan-made content. Very suitable for short gameplay sessions. Even if you can't finish a mission in time, at least you've learned a few things about that mission, arming you with knowledge for the next time you go in. Good replay value.Cons: Grenades can only be thrown in a horizontal line. You can't throw one over a wall or a vehicle. Lack of crouch makes it impossible to present a smaller target or move underneath a window without being spotted. Again, may be a design decision. Some of the weapon stats do not always give the player a clear understanding of the weapon's performance.Door Kickers 2 is currently in development, but the first game is still very much worth buying and playing. If you're looking for a good top-down tactics game, look no further.			"

												Do you really like tactical games? This is the game for you. Take control of a SWAT team and take them through various police scenarios such as hostage rescues, imminent hostage executions, drug raids, arrest warrants, and VIP escorts. There are many weapons that have their own individual stats as well as a variety of different equipment from different types of kevlar vests that protect more or less from different angles (front, rear, and sides), to different types of grenades (flashbangs, stun grenades). There's other ways of breaching such as using breaching charges, shotguns, bolt cutters, and much more. This game reminds me of the old Rainbow Six games and the SWAT games as well.			"

												One of the best games i've played in a long time, will be perfect for those nostalgic about the old SWAT games. While being highly addictive, its mechanics are extremely simple and easy to understand. Yet there lies a great challenge in executing them flawlessly, and succeding with your objectives without losing any of your men.Lots of content in it in form of single missions, campaigns, mod support and mission generator, so there's essentially an endless amounts of mission to go on. There's also some basic customization to get you a bit emotionally attached to your men (and women). However it seems that there are no female voices, so females will report in with male voices. No mp or coop yet, but I think they are planning to add that after phone versions release.Sidenote: If you use steam overlay a lot keep in mind that the shift key locks the path, so after you've been to the overlay press shift once to make the controls normal again.

Early Access Review
								REVERSE WARNING: This is actually the only Early Access game that I bought without regretting it later.Door Kickers is a solid top-down 2D tactical SWAT strategy / tactical / shooter title. You draw your troopers' paths with your mouse, place waypoints and commands and then watch the action unfold according to your plan. There is also the option to pause the action in real-time and switch orders on the fly. The game went through many iterations and improvements during early access, both frequent and meaningful in content and changes / fixes.The biggest draws of the game (apart from the obvious - existing in a great genre that is virtually abandoned) is the fact that it has Steam Workshop support and an integrated level editor allowing for infinite content. When the core gameplay mechanics are as polished and as fun, even simple user-made maps can add tons of replayability to a game that is already quite large in beta form.I bought this game in December 2013 and watched it blossom into the beautiful thing it is today, a couple of months before its final release. I recommend this wholeheartedly to anyone who is interested in the genre.			"

												This game has been on my wishlist for two holiday sales. Since I usually don't buy any ""wargames"" or straight up shooters I was hesitant to buy it, but finally gave in, when it was 50% off, thinking what's there to loose with the steam refund system?To my astonishment, it's a ""simple"" strategy game and that's just up my alley. Plan your way in with your squad, level them up, get new equipment and defuse dangerous situations: rescue hostages, defuse bombs, kill hostiles, save the day.The game itselfs has a huge amount of levels out of the box and with a superb workshop integration can be expanded indefinitely by community made levels and items. It's also really, really easy to make your own maps as a level editor is already integrated int the game. If you don't want to make anything too fancy (new texture, objects, round rooms) you'll be extremely happy with the in-game options for designing new levels.It really is a steal for any price (if you're looking at this review and the game is also 50% off, don't hesitate and just get it!)Here's the checklist of what you can expect:PROs:+ huge amount of levels+ great replayability (play with different squad members, play with different equipment, play from different entry-zones...)+ adequate learning-curve (easy levels to get used to the mechanics)+ ability to play any level at any chosen time (no unlocking levels, everything is available right from the start, though not every level is a good idea to play right away)+ controls are great with and uncluttered and handy interface+ squad members can be renamed and given their own design+ great steam workshop integration+ integrated level editor+ price for what you get is absolutely adequate+ replay ability from almost any starting point within a levelCONs:- campaign mode needs better warning for what happens to killed squad members (once you've figured it out though, you'll remember forever)- not all stats on items are relevant when equippedOverall: 8/10			"

												Door Kickers is a top down, tactical, strategy, shooter, hybrid developed by Killhouse Games. The core gameplay of Door Kickers is controlling a squad of trained SWAT team members as you clear out various locations, ranging from drug dens to warehouse's. The player can pause the game and enter planing mode. In this mode the player and set where their team will move and face to cover every angle. In this mode the player can also prep their squad to breach doors, throw grenades and set various other orders. Once the player resumes time the team will do the actions in real-time, the squad can also be controlled in real-time. The story comes from the games campaigns. Each campaign has permadeath for the squad members, so if a squad member dies in the first mission, they will not be available for any other mission, unless the first mission is restarted. Multiple campaigns with different difficulties, lengths and missions add a fair amount of replay value to the game. Campaigns, however, are locked until the player reaches a high enough profile level. Door Kickers also comes with single missions, some being training missions but most being more challenging. A random mission generator is also available. The player can choose the size of the map and how difficult it is, adding even more replay value. Door Kickers has various classes to be unlocked, from shields to breacher's, all with their own tools, weapons, and customizable names. There are well over 100 weapons and tools for the various classes. Players can complete missions any way they see fit, charging in with assault rifles and shields or stealthy with suppressed submachine guns. Players have complete control of how they execute a mission. Door Kickers does a fair amount right: Has a large variety of guns and classesHas great replay value from various maps and game modesAddictive Fantastic sound designThe art style fits wellDoor Kickers does a few things wrong: The player must unlock the campaignThe guns can be expensive to unlockDoesn't keep the player interested over timeCan be to easy/hard based on skill levelSurprisingly hard to remain stealthyOverall Door kickers is a solid title. With a price tag of $21.99CND, it is a bit pricy for someone who doesn't commonly enjoy this genre of game. If Door Kickers goes on sale, pick it up and try it out, it's a great deal of fun and great for killing some time. Have a good one ~Doc			"

								Overall the game is solid. It has a lot of potential to be a great game in the long run. The dev's put a lot of attention into it, and there are frequent updates. It's one of the ""good"" early access game on steam.The only thing I would hope to see in the future is a better tutorial system for new players, and more detailed options within  the menus.9/10			"

												So, to begin, I really wanted to like this game from the offset. I love Frozen Synapse and the idea of tactical, top down, squad shooters. I dived in with high expectations from all the praise I saw. The result of this endeavor was to be disappointed more than I have been in a long time by a game. I will say now - the game is solid enough. However, I encountered certain aspects of the gameplay that just broke it for me. Primarily, the lack of any form of viable introduction or tutorial. I know it has some moving pictures and whatnot, but all that it covers is simple enough to figure out on your own. There is no explanation for how to time entries into a room with a flashbang properly, no explanation why equipping weapons to some of the troops just outright doesnt work. The secondary problems are... well... mentioned above. It is a massive hassle to control the squad. There are no elegant mechanics like in Frozen Synapse that allow for a time delay or no-aim movement. It also makes control difficult due to bulky command images that cross over and make clicking on them a chore. A lack of any explanation as to why upgrading your soldiers abilities doesnt seem to transfer into the tactical game also makes the game frustrating. In short, bar the issues above, the game is spot on. Animation, sound, idea, everything. It is just a crying shame that actually playing it felt like work rather than enjoyment. Sadly I didnt enjoy the game at all and wanted to just make sure that the reason is out there.			"

												It's a shame I didn't reviewed this game earlier, cause Door Kickers definitely should be recommended :)About year ago(30.Sep.2013) I got Door Kickers as Early Access game and then I wrote:""Even for Alpha/Early Access Door Kickers looks so promising and fun.What game lacks for now(from my point of view) - non-lethal weapons, handcuffing and negotiating, by ""negotiating"" I mean - trying to force suspects to surrender and if something goes wrong you're free to shoot.In SWAT-2 before entry you have to negotiate with suspects by ""throwing phone"" or calling to the building directly - this gave you time to plan your entry or even trade out hostages.After that you could go dynamic or stealth according to situation, but all time from start to the end you advancing - slow or fast.But the main feature was that all time you was trying to take all suspects alive, save hostages and try to avoid losing officers.If you will add this-like flavor(no need to copy, just give it flavor as you see it), damn I promise that I'll buy second copy @ Steam :D""After a year of development, Dev  Team added all these features, except ""negotiating"", - but that's ok for me. Without this feature Door Kickers plays like R6 and that's not bad at all.Besides, they have added lot of new features:New modes like ""Drug busting"", ""Hostage Rescue"" and etc.Tons of maps.Scenario Editor.Video Export.Three amazing campaigns.Lot of toys for your Good Guys Team.Sniper Assist Workshop intergrationAnd many, many more... :)Anyway, would definetly recommend Door Kickers for anyone who played and liked Rainbow 6(R6: Rogue Spear and R6: Raven Shield) and/or SWAT 2, 3 & 4.

												i was watching some youtube videos and there was this video with the title ""Door Kickers , Suits and Ski masks"" ( Bluedrake's channel ),i watched the video,i thought the game looked cool and ok but i wasn't sure if i should get the it or not...i bought the game during the last sale and it's fantastic,this is one of those games that you have to actually play to realize how good it is,you can read reviews,watch gameplay videos,etc,etc but you'll never get how good it is unless you play it!at first the game starts with really simple and easy missions but as you progress missions keep getting harder and longer and eventually our tactical shooter turns into a puzzle game :| it will get to the point where you have to actually make plans for your every single action,and with each mistake you're risking losing your troops or failing the mission....i'm only half way through the third campaign but the game has already gotten so intense that i actually pause the game,check behind every single door and i think for a few minute trying to make 1 single but successful plan (never works and i end up restarting the level after 10 minutes xD )we're looking at a top-down tactical shooter that despise it's simple mechanics is insanely challenging and fun to play,it's really addictive too,i couldn't stop playing after finishing the first few missions.one of the best indie games that has been released recently with awesome Developers behind it,they update their game frequently with new content and they definitely deserve more attention and support...

Early Access Review
								Executing a perfect hostage rescue with simultaneous door breaches and flashbangs and a synchronized sniper shot through the window feels good. It doesn't even require crazy APM skills!This is a very enjoyable squad tactics singleplayer game, real time with pause for orders. It's like Swat and early Rainbow Sixes combined with Frozen Synapse with a bit of Xcom-like squad development and permadeath. Missions are quick and intensive deathpuzzles with randomized parts and there's already a pretty well functioning random mission generator that's probably going to get even better. The top-down 2D style is neat looking while functional and the environments are nicely detailed.Currently there's about 70 normal (not randomly generated) missions so it's got lots of content. It's already felt like a complete product in alpha and beta so I find it impossible that it would become worse as the development approaches 1.0 and more features are put in. Really good for those 15-minute lunch break-style playing timeslots.			"

												""I love it when a plan comes together!""A mix of Rainbow Six, Swat and Frozen Synapse.I bought this on a hunch, and I was not disappointed.I did not think I would spend this many hours in a game with such simple mechanic.I discovered how challenging and complex it actually is.How satisfying it is when you watch your teams breach and clear rooms with stunning efficiency, and how mad you get when the bad guys put a bullet in one of your operators because you told him to watch the wrong corner.I told you it was more complex than I thought, right?On some of the bigger maps it can sometimes get confusing when your operators movement-lines you draw on the ground get too close to each other. This causes you to adjust the wrong operator sometimes and can be really annoying.I find myself wishing for a feature to temporary hide specific operators lines, so you can adjust that single operator that covers the wrong door in the tangled mess of lines going everywhere. In a future patch maybe!4/5			"

												Best tactical/strategical swat/special forces indie game ever made. I mean - 5-6 full campaigns with different locations, setting, atmosphere, challenges and scenarios - clear the place, rescue hostages, defuse bomb etc etc. 5 classes of operators to choose from, a lot of weapons and gadgets you can select for your most effective equipment for current mission, then you have single missions - over 80+, totally awesome! Pew pew silencers onAnd enemies are spawned by 3-4 scenarios on every map, they never stay the same way, so you have to always check every angle and corner carefully, cause one mistake and they gonna give you a flag on your coffin. And theres editor as bonus and random map generator. 11 out of 10 flashbangs, would kill hostage by accident again.			"

Everything works smoothly and as expected and there is more content than I could have imagined.  I'm not even done with all the single player missions (NOT INCLUDING THE CAMPAIGN), never mind having 3 stars on all of them.  If you're a fan of top down tactics, you can't go wrong with this game.  Pros:Workshop support for extra nostalgia addonsControlsArtContent QuantityContent QualityCons:I can't make a Shield Trooper and another trooper go at the same pace automatically, instead the guy behind winds up walking ahead of the shield so then he gets shot in the face a lot.

												A fun little top-down single-player room clearing game. You usually control a small team, eventually composed of various classes, with a number of tools. You can make elaborate plans and/or clear in real time. Lots of workshop maps. If it's too easy, you can set various challenges for yourself, like tasing and arresting wherever possible instead of shooting, or doing the campaigns with permadeath on for your team members. Seems to be updated periodically. You can pause whenever and leave where you left off, nice when just taking a quick break.TL;DR: It's groovy.			"

Solid tactical gameplay with a great feel to it.The gameplay is divided into two parts, the planning phase and execution phase. The planning allows you to set up waypoints and stops using radio commands. Once in the execution phase you can watch your plan unfold or at any moment take direct control of your men. Add to that troop customization, gadgets, classes and squad perks, and you've got an enjoyable experience at hand.To me the game comes across as polished and well made. I enjoy the graphical style and the sound and atmosphere is good. The big challenge lies in creating a plan that'll allow you to sit back and just watch the execution phase. Difficult, but very satisfying when it works.			"

												Pause. Plan. Execute.The concept is pretty simple to pick up, but difficult to master.  There is nothing more satisfying, however, than watching a plan that you've spent time carefully fine tuning and perfecting to flawlessly be carried out by a squad of 8 who proceed to drop bad guys like its the new fad, save hostages, and defuse bombs; all of which occurs in a matter of seconds.There are 3 campaigns, close to a hundred single missions, and an in-game map editor to create your own missions.  Lastly, my favorite, a scenario generator in which you chose the size of the map and the amount of resistance you're ready to throat punch and the game generates a mission for you.  All of this leads to a lot of replayability.Also included, is a progression and load out system that allows you to customize every member of your squad, from class and weapon selection to special equiptment, portrait, and names.It's easy to see this game as a quick tactical shooting session and only expect to play in short increments, but its even easier to get hooked and start trying new strategies and techniques to get that 3 star rating on a mission.At $20 I can see many people waiting for this to go on sale, but I can assure you that it is absolutely worth it's price.

												What a great game! There is literally no down side. The only thing that hurts it, is actually one of it's better points. That being that it is too open ended to be played any one way.The level of challenge is up to you. Can you pre plan an entire mission without losing any troopers? Will you try to make arrest or just shoot everyone? Will you go the stealth way, the hard way, the quick way? Any way you choose will require very carfull planning. It's a simple game containing near infinite complexity. The one corner you fail to check, is the one that gets some one killed. So what do you get for your money? Everything but multiplayer (which is still being considered). It's one of the most replayable games I've ever played. 100 stock single missions, 6 big campaigns with a hardcore mode that save permadeath of your officers. You can always do any of this more perfectly, or all preplanned, or step by step, and if you run out of fun in about a year or 2, there is a easy mission / map editor and if that wears thin, it's already modded and workshopped to epic magnitude. It's RPG, TDS, RTS all in one. It shows you how to play, but never tells you how to play. If I told you how the game is played and a what I think of each aspect it would take 10 pages. Just watch the vids and keep in mind what I said. Best 20$ game this year. I'm gonna keep an eye on Killhouse. They seem to love the craft. I feel the feels inside for them. Sniff.... "

												Rainbow Six without uPlay SWAT4 without having to steal it (seriously, how is that game not on Steam OR GoG??)----In truth, it is like neither of these games. Except perhaps in that you're playing a military-ish squad of dudes with a variety of weapons and tools available.You drag your cursor to tell your individual dudes where to go, not to directly move them, the idea is that you're setting a plan (or altering a plan as needed) and then your SWAT team members execute that plan, shooting at any evildoers along the way. And you can only see what your squad can see via line-of-sight, which means controlling the direction your dudes are facing is of equal importance; it works nothing like most shooters, most of the real gameplay is in the planning stage (in my opinion at least; you actually can play it by ear with some degree of success but you'll almost never get a perfect run doing it that way)Reminded me a lot of Hotline Miami (1), in that, you're gonna screw up a lot, you're gonna swear nigh incoherently A LOT, but somehow still manages to be really really fun, and when you pull off a perfect mission its like SCREW YOU I AM THE SUPERIOR MIND (after failing it to comedic effect 9000 times first). And the fact that restarting and trying again takes next to no time at all, which is good because if you had to watch even a short loading screen every time you restart a mission it'd get tedious real fast.Lots of content, and if it isn't enough for you somehow, full Workshop Support (new maps, skins, guns, FULL support). And a mission generator, which I'm pretty sure everyone uses to cheap some achievements but I've heard it can also generate actual fun missions of whatever difficulty you like (which can be refreshing after you run out of interesting racial slurs to let loose after you've done something marvelously stupid and screwed up an otherwise perfect run on a really hard mission)			"

												You command a SWAT Team in different scenarios, be it simply eliminating all the terrorists or missions that include hostages or bombs to defuse.The level variety is great, the different types of mission always make the game seem fresh and provide a challenge.One mission might be a rather simple (but still demanding) run-and-gun assault on a hideout with not much pressure, another one might give you a small 20second window to eliminate a terrorist threatening a hostage.The levels can be approached rather casual if you don't mind casualties, but they are still challenging.Most players will rather take a more tactical approach where you minimize the collateral damage and have a ""more elite"" execution of your plan.The tactical possibilities for each mission seem endless with the variety of weapons and classes.Every mission can be completed with 0 (failed) to 3 stars depending on your performance with additional challenges that add replay value such as ""Only use real time combat"" or ""Only use one plan to finish the mission"", as well as the classic ""Beat this time"".The AI is good and always makes you think twice about your next move, their position also varies from try to try.Conclusion: A really engaging, challenging game that always leaves you satisfied after a mission. Quite some customization (weapons), leveling (different classes, experience, small ""perks"") options and enough missions to keep you busy for a while.Last but not least a small video that showcases how a mission works out after a few hours into the game (created with the ingame replay-to-video function)

												This is definitely one of my favourite games of 2014. It may confuse people looking at the 2D grafics when I say this game is amazing in every aspect of it. But everything fits nicely: The grafics don't hide information and for me they manage to be detailed enough convey the narrative while giving my enough space for using my own imagination. The UI is simple and easy to use. The sound effects are subtle (which is important, as you are going to hear them way too often when trying to get a perfect rating on a map). And the equipment is surprisingly well balanced, and personally I prefer balance to realism (it is really hard to explain why two .223 rem rifles with 10"" barrels, even if one is a long-stroke piston system and one short-stroke, would have so different power levels, but in the game, this makes both interesting). All leads to a very good immersion.The difficulty level is somewhat self-adjusting, as most maps are easy to finish. But getting 3 stars, using only one plan, no interaction afterwards? That takes more than a lunch break.It is not perfect yet, there could be some interface improvements when it comes to several troopers breaching the same door (whose tools are used) and a bit more synchronizing for cooperative action. And minor flaws like having female troopers but only a male voice set. And the three campaigns could do with some story texts. But these are trivial things that one will find in AAA productions, too.From a software developer's perspective: Recently, I backed three games (on Kickstarter and elsewhere).  Two (Wasteland, Jagged Alliance: Flashback) were a huge disappointment. Doorkickers was the only game that managed to continuously improve, seemed to have tight feedback cycles and was thought through from the beginning, so huge features did not come in late and were error-prone. And they polished their product before release. This speaks of a great development process and makes ""In the killhouse"" a company I would love to work with (if I were a game dev).			"

												If you like games such as SWAT 4 and the Rainbow Six games of old, then you will most likely enjoy this.There are a few different modes of play. Single missions (there are a lot!) allow you to essentially practice. The first few limit you to using only 2 good fellows against a small number of enemies with a mix of objectives. The objectives I have encountered so far are include (and you may have multiples of these on a mission) killing all the enemies, saving hostages, retrieving evidence, arresting a high profile suspect and escorting a VIP. There is also a random mission generator where you get to pick how big the map is and how strong the resistance is. Also you can create your own maps or download new ones from the Steam Workshop.The campaign mode can be unlocked after levelling up your squad by completing single missions. In this mode, if your troopers get injured they will be out of action for the next mission to recover, if they die they are dead. Dead as a dodo. Luckily you can restart the mission (don't leave the mission though!). However, there is also a hardcore mode, which will prevent you from doing this.Completing missions gives your squad experience (divvied up between the used members depending on how well they performed). As your squad levels up, you unlock more classes and also skill points to spend on improving the overall squad's reactions times and accuracy and a few other benefits. It also scores you out of 3 stars depending on how well you got your squad to perform. To get maximum score you need to and keep all your squaddies alive and complete all the objectives within the time limit. Those stars you can then spend on unlocking new weapons and equipment.Speaking of which. any tactical shooter would not be complete without giving you the option to swap out your gear. Each man has a slot for a primary and secondary weapon, armour, 2 small equipments such as flashbangs, breaching charges or lockpicks and 1 large equipment such as a camera to poke under doors or a massive hammer to smash down locked doors. There is quite a nice variety of weapons and equipment but I have found that there are only a couple of weapons I use anyway. There is one caveat: different classes allow and/or limit the equipment each guy can have.There are currently 5 classes playable: Pointman, Assault, Breacher, Stealth and Shield. The Pointman, as far as I can tell, is meant for high speed and mobility encounters (as I found with the VIP missions – if you don't get to him fast enough they shoot him!). You can only use a pistol but if used correctly, or if you have some meatier backup, then this isn't a problem. The Assault class gives you the option to equip some rifles or SMGs and is pretty self explanatory. The Shield class drops the primary weapon in favour for a ballistic shield. The level of protection the shield gives depends on which one you use but don't leave him on his own, he can only use a pistol. The Breacher uses shotguns which allows you to quickly blow locked doors off their hinges and is obviously handy in close quarters. Just don't send this guy into a small room with hostages in! The final class is Stealth. Essentially you get some suppressed weapons, which (not surprisingly) reduces the amount of noise you make.So what is the gameplay like? Well at the beginning of the mission you get to pick who you want to bring along and then place them in the predefined starting locations. Then you can plan out your mission before hit the play button. Once started you can pause at any time and make adjustments where necessary. The UI is very easy to use and entering rooms is far easier than any of the FPS games. How many times have you been trying to prepare a flashbang, only to accidentally open the door and have an AK47 in your nose? That isn't going to happen here (unless you like surprises and to go in all guns blazing).The AI can be lethal and you will want to make sure you keep those doors and corners covered just in case someone decides to take you on. Surprising the AI is always the best option but once they know you're there they will usually be ready for you in the next room or sometimes kill a hostage or start destroying evidence so you will have to be fast. If they are ready for you, you won't want your guys stacking up in front of the door waiting for the flashbang to go off. Those few seconds can get your entire squad killed, get them in cover or stacked either side of it! Or if there are no hostages in there, just use and breaching charge and blow them all to hell.This is definitely worth picking up and if you see it on sale, you have no excuse. Great game.			"

Door Kickers focuses on managing your team to complete various complex missions, ranging from killing a set amount of hostiles, to rescuing hostages, to disarming bombs, to arresting a specific target.Door Kickers really shines with its Real-time strategy elements, which reminds me a lot of the classic real time strategy shooter, Jagged Alliance. It allows you to choose to pause the game at any time to manage your team, using really simple and intuitive controls. I was surprised at how easy everything worked once I understood how to play.I found Door Kickers to be really fun to play. It does take a bit of time getting used to the controls and managing your team, but once you get the controls down you can easily get addicted to playing the game and finding new ways to complete the missions. You can also edit and create your own levels using the built in game editor, adding hours of extra game content.THE GOOD- A refreshing gameplay experience- An interesting blend of puzzle and action- Huge variety of weapons and equipment- Addicting gameplay, you feel the need to beat every level in one plan and with one soldierTHE BAD- Weak toturial- Stealth class seems to make Assaulter unnecessary- Can be frustrating at timesDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

								If you want a tactical, fun, infinitely replayable SWAT sim, you will adore this game. Especially with the monthly updates form the great dev team, this game is defiantely worth your money! For those who are interested in it, it is easily mod-able and has aboth a built in random level generator and an ability to make your own custom ones. I would definately give this game 10/10!			"

												First I should point out a misconception I had with this game that led to a negative review at first. This planning in this game is really not designed for you to make a perfect masterplan for each mission in one go. In my first hours of the game I was making long elaborate plans but elements of chance make this really unreliable. You can run a perfect plan one time and then run the exact plan again but maybe a shot will miss or an enemy spawns in the wrong place and that run is completely ruined, so you just restart over and over till it lines in your favor and that is not a fun way to play.Sure the game gives you the tools to make a masterplan like that but the inability to edit any of that plan without almost completely redoing it should be a sure sign that that is not the intended way to play.Once I dropped making plans and instead ran a little, paused, worked a bit more, etc I enjoyed this game much much more than at the start. One other thing is that the game really needs more non-lethal tactics, I recently took down a dificult 22 enemy level with only the tazers but ooooh many was that janky. When lots of enemies are tazed in a row the pathfinding makes it that you can only pick up one of them at a time, meaning I had to always have somebody on guard for when the other guys stood back up, and sometimes it didnt register that I was arresting them and then they got stuck in the throwing grenade animation for some reason?? Overall the game really doesnt seem to expect people to play this way which makes me wonder why they included the tazer at all.Other than that it's a lot of fun and thats about all there is to be said.

												Mods.Mods mods mods.(Don't mind the hours, I played this on another account)The most appealing thing for me from this game is the insane ease of modding. You can make a gun that fires at 10000 RPM, create a nuclear grenade, have a BULLET weapon fire two shots, or have armor that makes your troops invincible by just changing a line of code in a text file. I'm not exaggerating.Or maybe not. Maybe you feel like that all Carbines/ARs are completely stuck in Semi-Auto is silly for you and you want to make them fire in bursts or auto. Maybe you feel like a weapon is a bit underpriced or overpowered. Make some quick tweaks why not.You can also modify any official level in the game. Not only does that give many easy templates to work with and learn the editor without a tutorial, you can have a two dozen enemies in the first map just 'cause.You can also change parameters like how fast your troopers move, how fast they aim, their FOV, etc. I know some people like testing that kind of stuff in video games.Basically, you don't have to go to an obscure folder, download three different programs to extract the contents of a file, and then extract that files' contents (and realize you're pretty limited). Nope, just lovely, lovely text files. They also have developer notes to explain what each thing does.Some deverlopers say that their game has modding support. There's that and there's this. You don't get this much freedom in most modern games anymore.Just you know, don't use any of that to cheat. Cus' that's just being mean and not appreciate the effort the devs made into the levels.I hope this review does more than justify the price. (If it's not been already by other reviews)			"

												Door Kickers is a solid game and you might enjoy it (the crushing majority does, as it seems). But for me personally, it was a disappointment. I was really hyped about this game according to the trailers, there was no demo, and the game didn't live up to my expectations.I expected this to be more arcade-like, instead it's more of a planning/puzzle game. That wouldn't be a problem, but I don't like how it's implemented. There are basically two modes you can operate in: full-ahead planning or realtime mode.Full-ahead planning In full-ahead planning, you try to plan the whole operation (or most of it) in advance, and then just hit play and watch the action. It takes a long time, but if it works out, it is satisfactory. The problems are clunky controls and a lot of important stuff missing. Basic things like ""look around the whole room in 360° angle and shoot all enemies then go on"" are impossible. Instead you can look in one direction, then move a short distance, then look into different direction, then move a short distance, then look into other direction, ... until you cover the whole room. Even if your soldier encounters an enemy, he's happy to follow all the other orders including looking into a completely different direction, turning back to his enemy (what?!). So you need to use ""thumb up"" mark after every single move to make sure he actually kills the enemy before going away. That gets tiring quickly. A basic AI for your soldiers would be nice, but it's not there, you have to micromanage everything. So the soldier goes according to the plan even if there's a shootout 3 meters away from him. The soldier doesn't automatically take cover even though there's a cover spot half a meter away from him. People might argue this game is about micromanaging. Well, OK (I didn't expect that), but you can hardly do that in full-ahead planning, because enemy positions are random. And the developers give you no means to intelligently react to enemy encounters, neither in planning mode nor when executing the action (see the point below). Editing the plan in the middle is impossible. You have just spent 10 minutes carefully planning everything, and then you figure out that in the very second room you forgot to check the closet. You want to tweak the plan a bit. But guess what - you have to delete the whole plan after the second room, do the adjustments, and then re-create it again from scratch from that point forward. There's no way to edit the prepared plan in the middle. This is so glaring overlook then I can't explain it - for me, this was a showstopper for planning the action ahead. It also applies to real-time modifications to the plan (when you already started executing the actions) - no way to do that, it will destroy the rest of your plan. Say goodbye to intelligently reacting to unexpected events. Synchronizing actions from multiple soldiers is a major PITA. Something as basic as waiting for a flash bang to explode is not implemented. The soldier who threw the flash bang waits a bit (it seems), but the others do not. If you do not throw it through a door but around a corner, no one waits. So you need to do manual synchronization using ABCD codes. A lot of manual chore. If you have two soldiers, one with a shield, you get the obvious idea - one can go in front, shielding them, and the second behind him, shooting from the cover when he sees enemies. But no, there's no way to instruct them to go as a group.Realtime mode In realtime mode (well, almost real time, you usually plan just a few steps ahead and then unpause it), you need to micromanage everything, but at least everything works exactly as you intended - soldiers are properly synchronized, they don't rush into rooms before flashbangs explode, etc. However, if anything goes wrong and you need to restart the mission, it's an immense chore instructing them through all the rooms again, and again, and again. You can't save and reuse parts of previous plans. You can't toggle them to semi-AI mode and make them a bit smarter. So instead of spending a lot of time planning, you spend a lot of time redoing all your previous realtime instructions many times over. The realtime mode pains could be save by allowing the player to do ""snapshots"" - quicksaves and quickloads, but that's not there. Or perhaps offering to save and recall short-time plans for individual rooms, but that's not there either.So, in summary, I felt that I'm either frustrated by inadequate controls in full-ahead planning mode, or that I'm repeating the same short-time realtime plans over and over again, until I finally finished the level. I couldn't enjoy it.There are some technical issues as well, which annoyed me: Multimedia keys don't work, unless you switch to Steam overlay. Alt+tab doesn't work, unless you switch to Steam overlay. But then it glitches, and even though you are switched to other applications, Door Kickers are still displayed on top of them (so you can't see what you're doing). On top of that, you can't switch back to DK. That basically means you must try to kill the game blindly, or restart the computer, just because of using Alt+Tab (and of course you'll lose all unsaved progress). I'm using GNOME as a desktop environment, might be an issue specific to that.Aside from the technical issues, I like sound effects of this game, music is OK, but I don't like the graphics. First, the absolutely top down perspective doesn't look good, just a bit of isometric view would work much better. Second, the graphics are ugly and blurry, and the texture quality (or artwork quality, however you want to call that) is low. I have correct resolution set, but the whole game looks upscaled and far from crystal clear as I expected.			"

Posted: November 21, 2015
												Now before I go into my review I want to make one thing clear. I love this game. It is a very cool experience for those looking for a tactical strategy challenge of commanding a swat team breaching a building. However, there are just a few things that ruin the experience for me in some cases.First: The AIThe biggest problem that I have with the enemy AI is that they constantly open doors and just run out of them without and moments thought instead of posting up and keeping there guns trained on a door as they should be doing. Watching my guys mow down half of the enemy on one level just because they kept moving down a narrow hallway instead of fortifying themselves really broke my immersion.Second: Lack of Surrender OptionIf I was playing a military game, I wouldn't have a problem with my troops just gunning down unsuspecting enemies, and inspite of what people might think, SWAT team members are NOT allowed to open fire first unless they give proper warning and demand surrender from the enemy. The fact that this doesn't happen, and for a game that I assume is supposed to be simulating SWAT team breaches, really is disappointing when you compare it to something like SWAT 4 which this game seems to emulate from a strategic standpoint.Third: IrratationNow while some people may get the joy of going through a level for an hour trying to create the perfect plan, that isn't me. I'm the kind of guy who likes to do a level only a few times and not have to rely on trial and error mechanics to complete a level. And when I do complete one I don't feel sastisfaction at all.Fourth: ProgressionTo be fair, I'm not sure what progression system I would have chosen for this game, but I don't know if a star system like on mobiles games would have been the route I went. Really makes grinding extremely annoying. Plus I end up just not using most of the weapons and only go for the ones that are the best in the game.Fifth: Hostage Death = RestartThis is probably this most frustrating aspect of this game. I'm not sure what real life SWAT would consider a hostage being killed a failure, but being forced to restart the entire level just because one hostage out of like 12 gets killed is overly punishing. Especially if you consider that the SAS (I know its not SWAT but still) raid on the Iranian Embassy was considered a success even though a hostage was killed in the siege.Sixth: PriceFor a game that is $20, it just doesn't feel like it is worth $20 in the end. (I would recommend this game for $5 when it goes on sale but no more) DISAVOWED. $5 definitely pick this up, $10 sure, $15 eh pushing it but would still recommend, $20 no (at least for me). Some people might think this game is worth $20, which is perfectly fine if they believe so, but for me personally $15 would probably be a better base price tag.Overall, its a great concept and a good game, but it needs to lower its price and work on some of its flaws before I can change my review to positive.

Door Kickers - 8.5/10 Door Kickers is an addicting and challenging game, that hooked me from the first level. Much like Hotline Miami, the theme of a SWAT team making dangerous and daring rescue attempts is merely a cover up for Door Kickers' core puzzle like mechanics. The awesome feeling of pulling off a succsessful three star rescue attempt, after carefully planning down to the micro level each individual action of our members is second to none.The game presents you with several ways to access missions and earn currency (currency allows you to purchase different weapons and gear). Playing missions in each of the campaigns (there are currently 6 campaigns) Playing each of the over 100 standalone missions Downloading maps from the workshop (These do not get you currency) Making your own maps (These do not get you currency)The unlockable gear allows you to customise each opertive and in the later game it often makes sense to give each of your opperative a weapoin tailored to what they will have to do. Alongside this, there are also 5 classes, Pointman, Assaulter, Breacher, Stealth and Shield. They each have unique weapons and some shared weapons, as well as unique equipment.There is lots of good things to say about Door Kickers, but there are also a few issue at the moment. You are not able to reshape the path of an opperative without getting rid of all the rest of the path. The unlock system can be tedious at times and it can sometimes feel like a grind. Sometimes when you spend a long time creating a plan in order to get three stars, and then you have to quit the game or you feel like changing levels. There is no way to save your plan so you have to remake it when you come back.Overall door kickers is a great game that will easily last you 20 hours, and most likely even more. It is a particullarly good game to just pick up and play for short ammount of time, once you have unlocked a few of the weapons. BUY IT!			"

												It's nice, reminds me of  SWAT 4.It seems like a lot to take in, and certainly it takes a few mission runs before you become used to all the options available to you. But once you've gotten a few missions under your belt, ordering your squad elements and moving along with them becomes second nature. The structure of the campaign seems to mimic this standard learning curve, as the first few missions are rather simple and easy, but the difficulty ramps up considerably in the later missions, where you'll find complicated building architecture and numerous heavily armed suspects.

Summary: The game is awesome & full of tactical challenges.I've got this game in a bundle sale few months back, that's why it was untouched before. Recently I saw the announcement of the sequel so I though let's complete the first game. The game is really well made. Although it is top-down perspective but still graphical details are quite good. The game is challenging and it takes quite a precision planning to get 3 stars.Game play is very simple to learn but hard to master. You'll be presented with a map with few goons (default game comes with 6 campaigns and 75+ standalone maps), some time bomb or hostage or evidences (campaign only). You have to choose 2 or 4 or 8 soldiers and deploy in different location throughout the maps. Locations are pre-defined. Then you have to invade the map and kill the goons or capture the evidences or stop the bomb timer or rescue hostages. However, it requires precision timing and path / action assignment to coordinated attacks so that your soldiers don’t get injured (or killed). In hostage rescue situation, you’ll have to do it multiple times because you’ll die a lot or a goon has killed a hostage (strictly not allowed). This part is really challenging for softcore gamer like me.If I want to give point to this game, I’d give 8 out of 10. One of the best indie game in recent time. A must-have title.PS: This game has mod support; Steam workshop has lots of community created maps for more enjoyment. "

								A lot more fun than it should be. Part Rainbow 6 (the original) planning, part SWAT 2 RTS. It deserves a better description but that's pretty close as far as fun goes in my mind. Workshop support only increases the game's stock. Maps, sounds, skins and weapons are already abundant on the shop. Challenging in all the right ways. Plenty of stat tracking and rankings for those with a competitive edge. Can't remember the last down a top-down or a RTS game warranted the same attention from me, perfect game to pick up and put down at will.Don't let the hours fool you, I've been playing this in alpha form long before it was Greenlit and added to Steam. If you like throwing bangs, slicing pies, T-zoning, stacking and generally going HAM; do yourself a favor and pick it up.			"

												Fantastic game. Highly recommended. Harkens back to Rainbow Six (as you'll constantly read). Focusing on this game, however, it has solid gameplay mechanics. And is fair in it's execution. I did run in to one level that I couldn’t figure out but that was one level out of hundreds. And yes, this game has 100s of prebuilt scenarios. Also, it has a random mission generator. You get your money's worth and it's fun. There is not too much story -- actually, no story is fair to note but there is are 3 different ""campaigns"" that you can go through. Also the aforementioned 100s of missions and then the mission generator. So, again, a ton of content to be had. I don't have many complaints with the game. I suppose I wish it explained some the gear a bit better but for the most part you figure it out. To the best of my knowledge, a good portion of items are interchangeable. I could be wrong, who knows... Strongly recommended. Just buy it. Don't wait for a sale or anything silly. If you enjoy rainbow six (the planning phase, I should mention) and you like strat games, just buy it. It's an indie; support these guys and they can then bring out more awesome games.  The game is well optimized. It runs on my older laptops with ease as far as I can tell. No performance concerns to note.  "

												UPDATE TO THE UPDATE: I've just passed 100 hours in the game. Still pretty much a lot of fun. The developers have announced they are working on new updates expected before the end of the year to include an enhanced editor and more gameplay modes. So even if you aren't interested right now, put it on your wishlist and it might be on an upcoming Steam Sale.UPDATE: I'm posting a short update to this review. I've just passed eighty(80) hours in the game. The developers have released two updates, adding some new features and fixing some small bugs. The Steam Workshop community is very actively supporting the game (I have several mods there myself). Still highly recommended.ORIGINAL REVIEW:If you are at all interested in the subject you should definitely give it a look. The game is already well supported by the community and the Steam Workshop has some excellent mods, weapons and levels already. It's the old SWAT or Rainbow Six from a top down, 2D perspective that puts more emphasis on planning than quick reactions. Check out some of the Let's Play videos out there, or some mission video captures posted on my YouTube channel for more information.Now that it is in release, there are even more interesting features, the major ones being multistory buildings and drug busts where you have to race to seize the evidence before the bad guys dispose of it. Three campaigns have been added, which are a series of linked missions (also with some branched, optional missions) where you are limited to your existing roster. Without giving away any spoilers, there are a couple of really large maps set on a waterfront and a train station that combine long sight distances, dangerous approaches and unusual rooms and buildings. The game is pretty much bug free due to the long alpha period, with only a couple of minor items that have to be addressed. There is an excellent level editor that works pretty well, the only really awkward part being the current need to edit the background image (which is the floor or ground of the map) outside of the editor, should you want one that isn't the default grey warehouse floor. The developers have stated that they intend to add that background editing ability into the in-game editor. Also of note is the excellent Mission Generator. You select the size of the level and the amount of opposition and the game generates a random seed. Then you select either ""KillHouse"" (for a training map) or ""House"" (for a real world map) and the game generates a mission using one of the maps in the game. The mission could be just to eliminate hostiles, or escort a VIP, or run a drug bust, or rescue hostages. It's a real challenge because it's newly generated. Overall this is an excellent value for the price; three campaigns, 80 official missions (once you enable the two new missions via the Mods interface), a Mission Generator and tons of mods already in the Workshop. Highly Recommended.			"

https://libertariangaming.org/?p=1465 <better version of my review in the link behind!Doorkickers is an indie RTS/Puzzle game which involves you leading a SWAT team through missions. I've been following this game since late Alpha and have enjoyed it since it's early form. The gameplay is quite simple, but is hard to master. Basically you give your team check points to go to through the mission area. You tell them where to go, where to face, what to use and so on. It's somewhat similar to the mission planning of the old Rainbow Six games but now in live action, with a live pause available. The game features five classes that your officers can pick from. Pointman, Assaulter, Breacher, Stealth and Shield. The Pointman is the fastest through the door, but only wields a handgun. The Assaulter packs either an SMG or an assault rifle and is best at ranged gun fights. Breachers wield shotguns and can blow doorlocks off. Stealth wield silenced weapons and move quieter. Shield men wield large shields that stop bullets. In my opinion, most of the classes are useful, but I don't really use the shields as they are slow, and are doomed if they are flanked.There is about 80 single missions, 3 campaigns, a random mission generator and an simple editor so there is a lot of content on offer. The campaigns aren't very story driven, at all. There isn't a paragraph describing any story. I'm not saying it ruins the experience but it would have been nice to have that. Officers do take injuries during missions and can die, but this only really affects the campaign. The campaigns are quite short, but entertaining, and are worth replaying for experience points and stars (explained later). Although this game is mainly about planning, there is a bit of luck involved. I'd say it's 9/10 planning and 1/10 luck. Just know that♥♥♥♥♥♥poor planning leads to♥♥♥♥♥♥poor performance. One great thing about this game, is you can wing it, or plan the whole mission out (which gives a bonus in EXP).You unfortunately do have to unlock equipment during the game. Troopers level up during missions, and your entire squad levels up as well. Leveling troopers grants them better speed with shooting and using tools and accuracy. Leveling the squad grants doctrine points which grant all members improved abilities such as accuracy boosts, and one shot door breaching. It also gives access to more classes, as you only start with pointmen.Another thing worth noting is that you have to unlock weapons, by acquiring stars during missions. You get one for completing, one for having all troopers alive and one for beating it under time. It can be challenging getting all 3 stars on some missions but the rewards are worth it.One complaint I will make is that you have to erase all of your checkpoints ahead of a checkpoint if you want to make changes. This can make it more time consuming to change plans. I also find that sometimes I accidentally erase points which can be very frustrating.Another issue is the new story mechanic. Some missions have multiple levels but to be honest changing between them is quite awkward in my opinion and I feel the game would be better without them. My other complaint is that this game doesn't have a solid tutorial. Fortunately you can practice all you like on the single missions without an issue. The graphics of this game are quite simple, but I honestly think it's unfair to expect better from a 3 man indie team considering the scale of this game, and it's certainly better looking than a Unity engine game and to be honest the menu background looks great.Doorkickers has been my first adventure into PC indie gaming, and easily the best. A small, and passionate team who actually listen to the players, and use the advice to develop a competent and entertaining game that was realistically achievable. I'd give Doorkickers a 9/10.			"

												Door kickers is Awesome!Your OfficersYou can have a total of 10 officers. You will give each officer a class which you can change at any time before a mission starts. There are 5 classes total, 4 to unlock. You start with Pointman and unlock Assaulter, Shield, Breacher and finally Stealth. You then customize each officers class specific gear.Officer Ranking and Squad RankingEach officer has his or her own rank which increases as they complete missions successfully. Their skill level increases with rank. As your officers rank up so does your overall squad rank. DoctrineEach time your squad rank increases you gain a doctrine point. These points are spent on pistol skills, long gun skills and shotgun skills. These skills are passive and improve every officer regardless of their rank.DeathYour officers can die permanently and will be replaced with rookie officers if you choose to continue after a  successful mission. If you restart the mission you will still have that said officer for consecutive attempts.Missions and GearEach mission has a 3 star rating system. Each star awarded is currency to unlock gear. Gear is unlocked for the entire squad once you spend the stars. There are single missions, campaign missions and a mission generator for random missions. There is also the mission editor and steam workshop. You can plan a mission from beginning to end before you start. You can also pause the game anytime to plan as you go. If you are really brave you don't have to pause at all. It is very rewarding to watch your officers execute a perfect plan. You can even save replays and export videos in game. ConclusionIt takes 10 minutes to plan a mission and anywhere from 5 seconds to 2 minutes to execute the takedowns. This game could probably be used as a training tool if given to the right people. Door kickers is all about tacticle planning and strategy. Very fun game to play! Easily worth the full price but if you see it on sale don't hesitate to pick this one up. "

												Door Kickers was a huge surprise for me. A friend gifted me a copy and I have to say Door Kickers is like drugs, once it gets a hold of you you just don't want to stop playing. Door Kickers has you managing a SWAT team with upgradeable skills and equipment. During the missions there are a variety of objectives such as collecting evidence, defusing bombs, saving hostages, or just eliminating hostiles. You set up your team at the beginning of the mission and then plan out what they are going to do, once you press play the SWAT team runs into action performing all teh actions you set before hand. Now in Door Kickers you can watch your plan play out on screen, hoping for the best and restart if something goes awry, however if you are not worried about getting a ""perfect plan"" you can pause and modify your actions for your team at any time! There are a few different options when it comes to mission modes. You have the single missions, for quick play, you have the mission generator that lets you generate missions based on a few different parameters, and then you have the campaigns. There are a good handful of playable campaigns each with a variety of challenges and difficulties. If you couple that with the tons of different equipment and classes each SWAT member can have you are talking tons of gameplay and variation! If it did not sound like it could be any better Door Kickers also has mod and Steam workshop support! If any of the above sounds interesting I urge you to check out Door Kickers, or even the upcoming Door Kickers 2!			"

												I had seen videos of Doorkickers before receiving it in a bundle.  I have played games such as Frozen Synapse and Jagged Alliance 2, and found the tactical genre to be a bit of a mixed bag.  So when I saw videos of Doorkickers, I didn't think much of it.  SInce it came with a bundle of other games I liked, I gave Doorkickers a shot.And it was far more enjoyable than trailers and gameplay videos could get across.The joy of Doorckickers is primarily the tactical system.  From movement to breaching to cover and co-ordination, you have to think about them all, and the game lets you control it in a simple and easy to use interface.  The method of control is also flexible: you can plan every move in advance and let the scenario play out, or you can pause at any time to alter the gameplan when things go sideways.  Changes can be made in real-time as well.  The end result of all of this control and flexibility is a deep tactical planning stage followed by a typically short but explosive rush of action.Each mission stage is a layout of a building, structure, or outdoor location.  Warehouses, beach villas, parking garages, multi-story luxury apartments, and more... with Steam Workshop and a built-in editor, the variety in size, complexity, and tactical options are impressive.  You can play one off missions or dive into multi-mission campaigns where injury and death are long-term inhibiting factors.  A hardcore ironman mode is available to prevent repeated attempts at a mission to save key teammates from injury or death.Most missions have multiple tactical approaches based on which officers and gear you use.  Some missions are somewhat linear and can be approached methodically, while others usually turn into controlled chaos that you pray doesn't get you killed.  There is an element of RNG to shot accuracy, stopping power, and enemy numbers, but solid tactical choices can be made to deal with it.The squad you control is manned by officers you can customize in name, callsign, appearance, and gear.  Skill perks are squad training that all officers get the benefit of.  Roles include pointman, assaulter, breacher, stealth, and shield.  Each fills a vital part of the tactics, and they feel useful in their dominant environments.  When the mission changes, you can change up all gear and role assignments.Weapons range from the ubiquitous handgun, SMGs and carbines, shotguns, and non-lethals.  The variety of weaponry is sufficient, and a slew can be added with the Workshop.  Gear includes various armors, tactical grenades, cameras, and breaching devices.  It's fun to switch up loadouts, but there isn't too much here to overload the player with inventory management.There are bonuses in each mission to encourage different playstyles.  Lone wolf tasks you with clearing a mission with one officer, which casn be incredibly difficult.  One award is given for playing entirel in realtime with no pauses.  Lastly, an award can be earned for planning an entire breach and clear in advance, hitting play, and succeeding with no pauses or changes to the gameplan.  This last award is the most satisfying of all, and when 5-10 minutes of planning leads to a flawless execution of a 3-4 minute mission... the exhileration is real.  You can also save replays within the game, or export the replay to a video file to share and cherish always.Bottom line is that this game is a tactical dream that can be played for short bursts or full-auto for hours.  The variety and depth provide a solid amount of content.  Mods extend the life of the game and add all sorts of new weapons, gear, and interface alternatives.If your satisfaction is partly predicated on price, I would wager $10 to be wholly worthwhile.  That's 50% off the standard price, which might be steep for most.  Luckily, the game has been around a while and sales on this title are frequent.So gear up and get tactical!  It's time to sweep this hot spot like an efficient wave of justice.			"

												This is a great game, and it doesn't have a difficult learning curve to the play style.  First, you take over a SWAT team that consists of ten members with varying attributes in marksmanship, assault shooting(close quarters), and field skills(a skill that speeds up the ability to disarm bombs for instance).Since the game is in the top down mode, you are able to script out the directions you want your team members to move, provide covering fire, which doors to breach etc...  This is done before the match, and if you realize you made a mistake during the fight, you're able to pause, and re-adjust your routes, and covering fire; or you can make adjustments in real time.  As I said earlier, it's not a difficult learning curve, once you realize it's about applying covering fire for teams moving in open areas, or stacking alongside a room you're about to throw a flash bang in.  There is limitless possibilities you can create within the scenarios.The game offers 80 missions(and often, when updates happen, more missions appear).  You can also create your own quick missions with varying styles.  Which means you can go in just to kill the enemies, capture and arrest individuals without lethal harm, disarm bombs and rescue hostages.  The game offers 5 campaigns at the time of this review, and they each have an additional 5-6 missions of varying difficulty.  This is not to forget that Steam Workshop is enabled for this game, and you're honestly left with so many choices that just about everyone can find something they're comfortable with(ie: you can apply mods for military type actions, with military weapons , or extra police type actions for instance).The game progresses your characters by the number of missions that they accomplish, and the skills being applied are done for you.  It's up to you, and the mission to decide which of your team members gets placed in the action(for instance if you're disarming a bomb, you'll want someone with high field skills).  You'll also get experience to level up, which then you can unlock perks from a tree of skills to enhance skills with firearms(pistols, shotguns and rifles/carbines).  The game unlocks after certain levels as you can get different character sets, like breachers(shotguns), stealth(silenced weapons and movement), and using police shields to add extra defense to your team members.  Yet there is even more, you gain stars by completing missions(1 to 3 stars depending on what conditions are met), which the stars can be turned into buying upgraded weapons, body armor, accessories(tazer, breaching kit for example.  You basically have full control on what your team needs to complete the mission.This game doesn't have too many flaws(at least when I've played), and the developers are still really active in producing content for the game.  What I do find enjoyable about this game is that it feels satisfying every time I play.  I don't feel like I have to commit 2 to 3 hours a day to enjoy the game.  I can honestly play a single mission, or 30 minutes and I won't feel disappointed in what I've accomplished; and certainly there is enough it do in this game to have you lose track of time and play hours at a time if you wish.  I highly recommend this game if you enjoy a tactical game where you're able to do all the planning and adjusting real time.  You won't be disappointed.10/10			"

												Door Kickers is a top-down SWAT 3/4, so far it is very polished and very fun, open ended with the ability to do the mission as you please, either gung-ho and loud, or stealthy with suppresors. With more to come, including modding abilities and steam workshop uploading, this bad boy has not only awesome replayability at it's current Alpha state (Alpha 9), it is destined to have more bang for your buck at its basement bargain price. Pick it up today!OK, so let's update this review. This is one of those games that had early access, and I was very impressed with what they were working towards. Lose internet for six months, the Alpha kept me satisfied. Get back online, get the updates, and ERROR HOUSTON WE HAS PROBS. Damn game wouldn't start. So go to the forums, and shoot some basics to the devs, they have me drop them a real email with my problems.Within an hour, the co-founder of the dev comany was doing some troubleshooting (DAN, YOU ROCK!), got my pertinent info, and all problems solved. Needless to say, this game surpassed my initial expectations in Alpha. This game is the♥♥♥♥♥♥ yo. Get it, especially if you're a strategy fan, this is just the bees knees.			"

												In a world where there probably will not be a Swat 5, this is your substitute. Do not look at any others, as this currently IS it. And even for a top down shooter experience, this thing ain't a bad substitute either. You get that same sort of pull your hair out ""BUT THE ♥♥♥♥ER WAS RIGHT THERE"" experience that you do in Swat 4, and of course the much more fun sigh of relief when you actually DO experience everything perfectly.Plus, the shorter levels and plethora of mods make this an excellent reimagning on the genre, and alleviate some of the more rage quittingly high levels of difficulty that Swat 4 became equally famous for...

												After proudly playing this game for several hours I can say: This game is amazing. It has an immense amount of missions with several different scenario's where the same tactics don't work every single time, so don't worry about things getting repetative, the only way you can upgrade your squad is via completing missions and using the stars you gain to purchase weaponry, armor, tactical items, excetera, so that means you have a reason to do your best. Is this game frustrating? Absolutely, but what game isn't at times? Getting bored of what you see? Want something else? Want to burst into a crowded mall dressed like stormtroopers with miniguns? Want to kill your enemy's with the power of Dubstep? Or do you just think the games music is shoddy? Look no further! Mods take care of your extra wants and needs, all it takes is to click ""Subscribe"" to an item on the steam workshop item. This game can also run on a potato of a computer, so no need for a super setup.Overall, do I recommend this game? Absolutely.			"

Early Access Review
								Let me start by saying that I'm just a casual gamer that's into a variety of games, and had never heard of these developers (or really any indie devs!) before this game. I don't benefit at all by giving this a positive review, except perhaps by helping to share this great game and thus contribute indirectly to the sales and community - possibly allowing the devs to make it even better!Door Kickers is a Fantastic Game!! -- One of the best I've ever played, and there's still lots more to come! Door Kickers offers an enjoyable, realistic and informative peek into the world of tactical response police and special forces that is very secretive and usually hard to find (portrayed even semi-accurately at least) in the entertainment world. In a simple, fun, and effective way it showcases realistic tactics, weaponry, gadgets, radio chatter and movements in a variety of hostage, bomb defusal, room clearing and even tubular assault scenarios. Door Kickers is particularly enjoyable if you're into Police or Military Tactical Response/SWAT or Special Forces, but even if you're not, it's still an amazing and rewarding tactical game that enables you to think, plan and execute different strategies in a variety of different scenarios. It's NOT an exceedingly difficult game by any means, but there is plenty of room for perfectionist work if you so desire. Although the trailers play at full speed, there is a tactical pause feature that lets you think, plan and execute your strategies as fast or slow as you want. Would recommend Door Kickers to everyone! Lots of very cool new stuff is promised in the near future, such as Snipers, Ballistic Shields, Tazers, and a Campaign (in addition to the dozens of single missions currently available). The updates have been released very regularly so far - the devs obviously care about the game and have already implemented alot of suggestions from the community!   In short, you should get it!  You won't regret buying this game!    11/10!			"

								When I first played Door Kickers it was a few missions in a shoothouse with a few guys available. Since then the team has added loads to a very easy to learn but tricky and satisfying to perfect game model. It brings back memories of the early Swat games and the tenseness of entering a room is great. The balance between direct controlling units and ordering team mates via go commands allows for some immensely satisfying moments when it all goes slickly. Some times it doesn't and everyone dies, tough luck it was your fault not the game, you learn and then do it all over again slightly better. All in all it is just nice to see a greenlit game that is well put together and well supported.			"

												Fans of Frozen Synapse, Breach and Clear, and other similar tactical games will love Doorkickers, and with good reason - it has a lot to offer, whether you're a meticulous perfectionist or you prefer to run your plans fast and loose. Since you can pause the game to revise your plan (or even alter it in real-time) at any point, it's entirely up to you how active you want to be in guiding your soldiers through each level. You can even try to run a mission with a single trooper. Outside of missions, you can spend the stars you've earned to unlock new equipment for your troopers, and experience will unlock small skill improvements. All the elements of the game come together fairly well - the differences in classes and weapons are small enough that players who aren't concerned with meticulously min-maxing their loadouts can ignore them, but still significant enough to allow for lots of tactical options. The simple controls mean you can create plans and revise plans very quickly and easily.Doorkickers does have a few issues, particularly with the control scheme. It's sometimes difficult to predict what a particular trooper will do in a particular situation, particularly if you're the kind of player who likes to plan the whole mission out ahead of time. For example, if you order a trooper to breach a room with a flashbang, and that door is already open when he arrives at it, he will head in without throwing one, sometimes leading to his death. Multi-story buildings don't allow you to create plans past the first story. Missions with lots of troopers will clutter up the screen with countless paths and orders.Perhaps most frustrating to me, as someone who is used to Frozen Synapse's determinism, is the element of randomness in every engagement. Sometimes the difference between a good plan resulting in success or total failure is up to random enemy unit placements and split-second chances, meaning that to get that perfect 3 star score, you sometimes just have to keep running the mission until the stars align and everything goes right.But I think it says something about how much fun Doorkickers is that despite these annoyances, I'm still heavily recommending it. I've had a lot of fun with it so far and it's great for a quick fix of tactical gameplay. As I'm writing this, it's on sale for 2.99 which is a fantastic deal.Oh the soundtrack is nice too.			"

Early Access Review
								Let me start by saying that I'm just a casual gamer that's into a variety of games, and had never heard of these developers (or really any indie devs!) before this game. I don't benefit at all by giving this a positive review, except perhaps by helping to share this great game and thus contribute indirectly to the sales and community - possibly allowing the devs to make it even better!Door Kickers is a Fantastic Game!! -- One of the best I've ever played, and there's still lots more to come! Door Kickers offers an enjoyable, realistic and informative peek into the world of tactical response police and special forces that is very secretive and usually hard to find (portrayed even semi-accurately at least) in the entertainment world. In a simple, fun, and effective way it showcases realistic tactics, weaponry, gadgets, radio chatter and movements in a variety of hostage, bomb defusal, room clearing and even tubular assault scenarios. Door Kickers is particularly enjoyable if you're into Police or Military Tactical Response/SWAT or Special Forces, but even if you're not, it's still an amazing and rewarding tactical game that enables you to think, plan and execute different strategies in a variety of different scenarios. It's NOT an exceedingly difficult game by any means, but there is plenty of room for perfectionist work if you so desire. Although the trailers play at full speed, there is a tactical pause feature that lets you think, plan and execute your strategies as fast or slow as you want. Would recommend Door Kickers to everyone! Lots of very cool new stuff is promised in the near future, such as Snipers, Ballistic Shields, Tazers, and a Campaign (in addition to the dozens of single missions currently available). The updates have been released very regularly so far - the devs obviously care about the game and have already implemented alot of suggestions from the community!   In short, you should get it!  You won't regret buying this game!    11/10!			"

												Door Kickers is a pause and plan RTS with a focus on high energy, high impact tactical gunfights.  You normally control a team of 2-8 SWAT personnel and are charged with eliminating tangoes, defusing bombs, rescuing hostages and all sorts of other goodness.  The planning is intuitive & easy to implement.  It can be done entirely through mouse commands or by using the keyboard to trigger go codes.  Gameplay is fast and lethal - your SWAT wear body armor, but that doesn't mean they won't go down if someone empties a MAC-10 at them or if they step out in front of a shotgun.  As a result, you're constantly planning how best to win the fight before your man is ever in view - distracting the enemies by popping a trooper into view and then flanking them, stunning them with flashbang grenades or whatever other fiendish tricks you manage to pull off.  Enemy A.I. varies from cautious (hunker down and wait) to aggressive (investigate gunfire/other loud sounds) and changes between playings.  Most of the more complex scenarios offer several possible enemy set ups, deemphasizing puzzle-based planning and providing a more organic experience (is that room to the left clear or can it be safely ignored?).  The enemies carry a full range of weapons and can even load up on heavy body armor - there are an unrealistically large number of tangos, but this yields a more satisfying experience and you'll find yourself going along with it.Moreover, I have been playing Door Kickers since the alpha and, with each new iteration, the game has continued to grow and evole.  The dedication of Killhouse Games to delivering the best product possible has been something to behold and I can say that from personal experience they are very receptive to feedback from the community.   They have worked hard to pack a lot of value into the package - at present there are over seventy single player maps, plus three campaigns, a random scenario generator and an editor to enable users to design their own maps.  The game itself offers a wide variety of experiences, from simple missions that can be knocked out in a few minutes (when you're just looking for a quick release during downtime) to large, complex hostage rescues which require both planning and precision to pull off.In short, this is one of the best computer game purchases I have made over the last couple years - if any of the above sounds appealing then I highly recommend picking the game up.

												Fantastic game. Worth every penny.If you have played any of the previous SWAT or Rainbow Six games, you can expect a similar strategic style, albeit in a top down isometric view. It's one of those easy to learn, hard to master type games, where you will constantly perfect strategies and re-run missions to achieve 3-star ratings. The game rewards your hard work with unlockables, specifically new guns and gadgets. There is also a level up system, similar to that of the XCOM series, where specific officers will improve their abilities as they are involved in missions. There is a mixture of both campaigns and time-trial based single missions and already an abundance of content.The game already has a vibrant modding scene, which is great because this game lends itself to the creation of new maps and guns. It already feels like there is far too much to do in it.The game is also extremely polished. There are a couple of small bugs here and there, but it's highly unlikely you will encounter anything game-breaking.Highly recommended!			"

												Door Kickers is an awesome real-time action strategy game where you take control of a swat team during numerous raids.There is a level generator which will (to your choice) give you either a map created by the game developers with a random mission and random placement of the bad guys, or a killhouse which is a completely random place, never before created for another user.Amazing game 10/10.

												When I play the first mission, it's very fresh, but after several mission, it's a bit tedious, for you need playing a lot to unlock the careers and skills, weapons, equipments.And I only have 2 troopers and handgun at first...Luckily enough flash grenade and they will never die...It's easy at first, so I just kill them. I realize the hostile will notice that the troopers here once you make some sound and they will make some actions, but the their position is terrible at first, so it doesn't bring any trouble to me. Until the 10th mission, I got trouble, big trouble...They attack me at my rear! I only got 2 troopers to against more than 5 guys and I got nothing to stop the sound with kicking, flashing or gun! So you really need some tactic, also skills and good weapon may needed.I also tried the Campaign, different from the Mission, you will lose your troopers if they dead. But don't worry, only works in the Campaign and you can reset it anytime you want( such as you got no chance to win).Still playing, so I'll keep updating this review.			"

								This is a great game for those of you that enjoyed games like the Swat series, Jagged Alliance, and ""Breach & Clear (On Android/iOS systems and or Tactical and strategy enthusist.  This game combines tactical with strategy allowing you to setup your SWAT team by choosing the weaponery, stacking your units on a door to either breach/bang/c2/kick/shoot the door, and sweep the room guns blazing or going stealth. Amazingly the game allows you to pause and coordinate your manuvers. For example if I want my men to look a certain direction when sweeping a room, it allows me to do it with ease. The gameplay is pretty straight foward and easy, it can be tough though, espicially if you don't coordinate wisely. In other words it's very easy to have a man down so be careful. Lastly, the A.I. is pretty good, sometimes they all end up coming to you which can be unrealistic but other times they can be super realistic. Espcially when you have a hostage sceneario. The hostage A.I. are pretty complex too, If you kill the other suspects for every shot the hostage taker hears, he takes a gamble on whether he will kill the hostage, wait, or investiage.

												WARNING:Most of my complains here are after the 12 hour mark, but in future content may be added which fixes the issues I have.Doorkickers is a top down SWAT simulater where you control a small team and plan different raids. You have a planning stage for each map where you could take 30 minutes making sure you cover everthingthing, or you can go by the seat of your pants, since you can pause time and give orders in the raid itself. Doorkickers is mostly about planning each mission to perfection, and at the beginning it's great- the maps are small, you can generally plan the whole thing out and make no alterations to that plan and it's wonderfully tense as everyone dies in a few hits. However, after around 12 hours it all falls apart- maps are larger and there are more enemies, so you have to be flexible and this means no more planning for the entire mission, it's more room by room. Gang members get bullet proof vests, high powered weapons and explosives (WHAT?!) so they tend to be massively over powered, and this ruins the balancing that was perfect before.Really, aside from some control issues and not being able to plan for team members dying the beginning of the game was a good 9/10 but after it was watching it slowly die off. I will recommend it for the fun that could be had but it really was disappointing "

								This is one of the most refeshing takes on tactical shooters I've played in the past few years. Everything in this game is simple to allow just about anyone to pick it up and play, yet still allows an immense sense of depth and tactics. I'm a huge miltary nerd when it comes to CQC tactics, needless to say I couldnt checkout fast enough when I figured out what this game actually was. It cures that tactical itch that hasen't been touched since the early Rainbow Six / Ghost recon days. Yeah it's THAT good. This game is an unforgiving monster, but at the same time is as sweet as candy when you know what your doing. Setting up your entire plan in one step, then watching all your men carry them out with precision... that's something that never fails to bring a smile to my face. I jumped on the bandwagon pretty early, and every alpha that gets released I find myself saying ""How did I live without this?"" This game started out solid, and improves by leaps and bounds with every alpha released. The Devs. are also a great group of guys, always listining to the fans for feedback and future ideas. Two thumbs up to all of you at Killhouse, you guys are freaking awesome!			"

								Door Kickers adds a great level of polish and accessibility to a hardcore tactical game. It plays quite similarly to Frozen Synapse, or the planning phase from old-school Rainbow 6, but your troopers are extremely easy to control and manage. You can either try to develop the perfect plan from the get-go, or pause the action and modify your plan on-the-fly as you react to enemy movement. Speaking of the enemy, the AI in this game is fantastic. The enemy AI will move around the map, patrol, react to sound and fighting, and surprise the hell out of you by flanking your men that you thought were perfectly surrounded in cover. Add to this a potent blend of customization, and wide range of tactical options at your disposal (you can play as a silent death squad, with all recon troops, or with a band of door-breaching shotgun-wielding fighters, or anything in between).

												Doorkickers is TOTALLY COMPELLING. You maneuver your team (often just two operatives in the early missions) through a space, using a waypoint order system - and you can pause at any time to issue new orders or completely change your plan. And every map has slightly randomized enemy placement, so you can't just learn the board and precisely plan for it; one run thru will go wonderfully, but on a second try for more points, both operatives will be killed when the enemy placement changes just a bit. So it becomes not about learning the maps, but learning good tactical discipline, regardless of the map. And enemies are smart; I've been snuck up on and ambushed. By going back through the early missions several times with untested, rookie operatives I was able to unlock the Assaulter class quite quickly - what has been described as a 'grind' looks a lot more like skill refinement, to me. When I got to a campaign mission and was completely owned - repeatedly - on the second map, I realized my command of my abilities was quite lacking, and went back to polish up. I've also been watching some enjoyably brief Let's Plays (by RedatMath) and seeing I haven't even used certain tools in my early arsenal, like the camera wand or breaching charges. So complaints of having to grind for simple tools don't resonate with me - the game feels like it's asking me to gain mastery with my starting toolset before widening it. Overall, I'm finding it a very enjoyable tactical hole to climb inside; there's always another way to handle a room, another challenge from a room with too many entrances, and another door that needs to be viciously kicked and stormed through. 10/10 would run in and get shot again.

												Honestly I love this game, I've own this game for about a couple days now, and I've already wasted 11 hours into it.I'm going to base this game on 3 categories: Price, A.I., Replayability1st the price 10/10. Well to be honest when I had first seen this game I thought it was a fairly simple game that would be worth, at max $5, but then I looked further into it, and for the amount of content this game offers $20 is more than a fair price. This game offers not only 6 seperate campaigns (With their own lengths and difficulties) 70+ missions (seperate from the campaigns) steam workshop availibility, but also your own map creator. Now honestly how many other games give you this much content for just $202nd the A.I 8/10. The A.I. could use some improvement I will admit, but people saying that the A.I. doesn't fortify in a room are wrong, the A.I. do fortify in rooms, for example on the single player mission Cartel Beach Party (Unfortunately the chief wasn't invited and was very displeased about it, so he had told a small handful of the best troopers to go in there and end the party.) the A.I. do fortify, how they fortify I will not tell, you'll have to find that out on your own. There a multitidue of other misisons the A.I. fortify on, but this mission is the best example (at least to my knowledge)3rd replayability 10/10. This game is all about replayability, there is tons of ways you could go about beating every mission, want to go full stealth ops on every mission? Go ahead! Want to just shotgun the sh!t out of everyone? Be my guest! Want to try and beat every mission with your most well seasoned trooper? Do as you please, no one is stopping you! Other than the multitude of ways you could go about beating every mission you can also challenge yourself by trying to beat your old highscores on every mission. (Or at least getting 3 stars on every mission)			"

												Door Kickers is a really good game, its like the planning mode in the old Rainbow Six games. There are lots of missions and four different types of missions: hostage rescue missions, bomb defusing missions, VIP rescue missions and standard ""kill a terrorists"". You can specialize your squad in five different types of policemen, so lots of variation in the strategy.I recommend it to everybody who likes solving puzzles and/or liked the old Rainbow Six planning mode.

												Good game. Tactical RTS RPGish hybrid plenty of fun. The campaign however seems to suffer from bug in the second mission of the first campaign which lock you out of retrying if you hit continue instead of retry. Hope they will fix it soon. It's a very annoying bug and as far as i can tell the only fix right now is resetting your progress...			"

												This is an amazing real-time strategy game. Not only does it have tons of content (5 classes, 70+ missions plus 5 campaigns with another 38 missions), it requires well-thought out plans to progress. This game makes you feel like a real SWAT commander, just like the old Rainbow Six and SWAT games. I also love how detailed the levels are. But the number 1 reason I love this game is the AI. Most enemies run to cover or hide, like real terrorists would, and as soon as they hear cops, they execute hostages (Which is why you need to be stealthy, just like the SWAT when they rescue people). Then there are operators who stealthily throw grenades through windows before you even see them (smart, huh?). The game may sound really difficult, and it is ( I had a to try a mission full of operators 600+ times! ). Luckily the game has a restart button you can press when somebody dies (unless you are playing iroman, like the hardcore.) My only complaints are some missions favour the AI, and there is one mission I cant get more than 1 star on because sometimes an enemy is outside the map. Overall, this was a great game that i enjoyed, and I look forward to any new games that Kill House may release. Graphics 7/10Gameplay 9.5/10Music 10/10Overall: 9/10 "

												One of the greatest, if not the best, tactical enforcement simulators I've used (that is available to the public).While not everything is 100% realistic, it is still real enough that it holds up well to real tactical situtations.Being that this is sold as a game, I wouldn't expect 100% realism anyway, as pure realism does not always equal any fun.WIth a large Steam Workshop community and some really high quality mods available, this game has everything you need to enjoy some serious tactical strategy.Also includes a well made level editor so you can create just about any scenerio you can think of.

			Views: 690		

			Door Kickers is a top down tactical strategy game on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/248610/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing: https://twitter.com/TheSocioPsycho...		

Door Kickers is a top down tactical, turn based SWAT-style game.  The game alsoallows for mods, and they provide the tools for player to generate new levels,adding to the already large amount of content the game contains and encouragingreplay-ability.  Each level includes stars to encourage proficient play, as wellas challenges for the missions, which also encourages players to replay levelsto try for better scores.The UI is basic click and drag, as you position your SWAT team members in eachmission to try to immobilize the enemy.  You cannot plan too far ahead, however,as the enemies randomize their patrol routes and pathing.  The gamealso utilizesthe restart function well, so that you can learn from mistakes and correct them.Weapons have a skill set, and individual players have skill sets as well, whichgives the players a chance to customize the game to their preference.  Thedifferent player abilities as well as the variety of weapons and their customi-zation are very well balanced.The abundance of variety in this game take away from any linear feel, as well asthe randomization of the enemies.  The game is very just, and at no time did Ifeel like my time was wasted.  This game does everything that it set out to verywell.  I enjoyed my time playing this game, and can easily recommend it.This is a summary of what I talk about in the video, I am a YT'er not a BloggerThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												9/10 As a cop myself this game is pretty damn kewl. It's a good way to excersice your mind after a long day. You really can control every thing the officers do. From where they look at exactly the right moment to when to reload and perfectly timing a breach into a building. High replayablility value as well. I've enjoyed going back to missions and trying different ways of completing them. Workshop content improves the game even more so adding even more customization. I like the fact that you have to upgrade the officers as well. The fact that they progress makes you start to choose favorites and invest yourself into the game further. 9/10			"

												I cannot recomment this game in good conscience.  It is a great concept, but its excecution is so flawed that it is often more frustrating than enjoyable!There are a number of bugs/flaws which makes for a frustrating experience.  For one, you cannot delete all the checkpionts, so you find yourself making mistakes and then having to undo your entire plan because a point that you definitely do not want, decides it wants to stay.On top of this, the men do not always listen to your commands.  I have a mission where I have to breach a number of doors and my men surprise me by deciding if and when to throw their flash bangs!  So I went to 80-90% success, only to have this kind of ridiculous mistake happen and have to start all over!Your men are in fact untrained dumbskies!  If, for example, they are told to breach a door, but that door gets opened by the enemy, your men get to that point and sit there like sitting ducks.  So you can have a perfect plan that goes down in flames because a door, which they think they need to breach is already open and they don't know what to do from there.The randomness is a bit too random, sometimes, baddies are just piled into a room, so a perfect plan goes bad because you simply cannot cover everyone.  In real life, thee men do not hang out in three corners of a room waiting for something to happen!There are a lot of missions and content, but they all seem to be the same.  It would have been much better if the missions were progressive, you learning new skills and dealing with intentional situations.  This feels like empty game play that is very redundant.These combined makes the game too frustrating to truly enjoy!			"

This game has an amazing replay value and since it is in alpha there is much to be added to make it even more replayable, but thanks to steam workshop, you could play this game for a whole day! 10/10 P.S.

												A very nice and strategic, top-down game where you control a squad of SWAT members. You can either plan your attack before hand and execute the perfect police-raid, or improvise and command your squad while in action. You can level your squad and unlock new weapons and equipment, like stun-grenades and tazers for non-lethal raids, or advanced combat rifles if you need to get a more hands on approach. Once you level up your squad you can attempt the Campaigns, where, if your members die, they actually die and you have to fare without them. Definetly worth the cheap price for a nice solo game experience.			"

								Door kickers is great. Its easy to understand but hard to master and the single screen levels are great for killing five mins here and there. The game is about guiding a Armed team of presumably cops through a level capping bad guys, saving hostages and defusing bombs. It’s like a top down version of rainbow six. The levels are varied as are the unit types and the game play is fast yet addictive. You’ll want to get you times as fast as possible while incurring no team deaths again very similar to rainbow six. I also respect the developers of this indie title, they’ve been working hard to continually update the game and the updates are always big deals that add a lot of new content or features. They are also very good at interacting with their consumers and those that bought the game early. It’s jus t anice touch of class that is sometimes lacking. The integration of Steam Workshop is also awesome. In all Doorkickers is awesome and I’ve spent a lot of time with it. I genuinely look forward to the next update as they always do something pretty cool. "

Once your plan is drafted execute and witness your officers engage; top down action rarely seems so tense.I have had some disappointments commiting to early access games in the past but DK is throughly enjoyable, addictive and intelligent.

												They understood everything which makes this kind of game entertaining.You can always finish a mission after tries and retries, but mastering the winning keys is another story. Pick your equipment, position your men, and take decisions always trying to minimize the risks for your men. The ""Tacos"" AI is pretty good. Some will hide and wait for you, other Tacos will be more agressive, they will lookout from where the sounds are (use this against them).There missions are varied, from the classic ""kill everybody"", protect a VIP, to recover the drug before it gets destroyed, or disarm a bomb before it explodes. The number of levels is astounding, all with their particularities.If you are good and patient enough, you may prepare your whole plan carefully and just watch your men move on. Or you can play in realtime, or a mix of both. Two very nice approaches.			"

												This is probably one of the best tactical games I've ever played.Every mission requires precise planning, a good loadout for the situation, and teamwork. You can't just run in and shoot up the place and win. You must use your squad to execute precise maneuvers in order to complete the objective with minimal SWAT casualties. For example, using a spy camera will give you the upper hand when breaching a door, so you know the enemy positions before entering the room, and your squad will know where to aim beforehand. In other situations, using the spy camera is not the best option, because there might only be a small hallway on the other side of the door, and checking first might slow you down, as you are racing the clock. Most missions will have an objective time goal, which you must beat to get the maximum amount of points, so completing the mission in a quick, clean manner is the optimal goal.Now, twenty dollars might seem like a hefty price for a game like this, but there are three main campaigns, each with at least an hour or more in them, and a ton of single missions, mostly involving just clearing a compound of bad guys. The Steam Workshop offers many player-made campaigns, many of which are very well-made and add many hours of playtime to this game. In my opinion, $20 is a worthy price for this game, but if this isn't at the top of your wishlist, I would reccomend buying it when it goes on sale.			"

Breaching through by kicking doors and shooting bad folks in the face by sequentially executing commands is just so satisfying.With the simple top-down view and intuitive controls, it's easy to get into but also presents a very steep learning curve for those who want to execute the operations in one swift swoop.The soundtrack for the game is also amazing, adding another dimension to this fast-paced real-time strategy game.Doorkickers is a terrific game, way more than the sums of its parts - and brilliantly so.

												They understood everything which makes this kind of game entertaining.You can always finish a mission after tries and retries, but mastering the winning keys is another story. Pick your equipment, position your men, and take decisions always trying to minimize the risks for your men. The ""Tacos"" AI is pretty good. Some will hide and wait for you, other Tacos will be more agressive, they will lookout from where the sounds are (use this against them).There missions are varied, from the classic ""kill everybody"", protect a VIP, to recover the drug before it gets destroyed, or disarm a bomb before it explodes. The number of levels is astounding, all with their particularities.If you are good and patient enough, you may prepare your whole plan carefully and just watch your men move on. Or you can play in realtime, or a mix of both. Two very nice approaches.			"

												This game is awesome! I love the details taken into perks, weapons, and armor selection. The tactical applcation of room clearing per individual members of the team is perfect. Being able to see the current angle on one unit compared to the others is a HUGE tactical advantage of understanding angles and perspective shooting. I will play this game for hours on end.			"

												This is probably one of the best tactical games I've ever played.Every mission requires precise planning, a good loadout for the situation, and teamwork. You can't just run in and shoot up the place and win. You must use your squad to execute precise maneuvers in order to complete the objective with minimal SWAT casualties. For example, using a spy camera will give you the upper hand when breaching a door, so you know the enemy positions before entering the room, and your squad will know where to aim beforehand. In other situations, using the spy camera is not the best option, because there might only be a small hallway on the other side of the door, and checking first might slow you down, as you are racing the clock. Most missions will have an objective time goal, which you must beat to get the maximum amount of points, so completing the mission in a quick, clean manner is the optimal goal.Now, twenty dollars might seem like a hefty price for a game like this, but there are three main campaigns, each with at least an hour or more in them, and a ton of single missions, mostly involving just clearing a compound of bad guys. The Steam Workshop offers many player-made campaigns, many of which are very well-made and add many hours of playtime to this game. In my opinion, $20 is a worthy price for this game, but if this isn't at the top of your wishlist, I would reccomend buying it when it goes on sale.			"

												It's pure strategy, and it's brilliantly presented strategy. Breaching through by kicking doors and shooting bad folks in the face by sequentially executing commands is just so satisfying.With the simple top-down view and intuitive controls, it's easy to get into but also presents a very steep learning curve for those who want to execute the operations in one swift swoop.The soundtrack for the game is also amazing, adding another dimension to this fast-paced real-time strategy game.Doorkickers is a terrific game, way more than the sums of its parts - and brilliantly so.

												Reminds me of Frozen Synapse, which is an excellent game, with the exception that you can pause at any time, or you can choose not to pause ever and just guide your troops in real time. The more difficult missions are like puzzles where you have to manage your limited number of team members but still cover all the possible angles where an enemy might try to take you by surprise. You may also have an additional requirement besides just neutralizing all the enemies (""tangos""), such as saving all the hostages. The situation might be that the enemies will start shooting the hostages in one minute, and you must make your way to them quickly enough, or there might be a time bomb to defuse. On some levels you get sniper support, with the sniper somewhere off the screen, able to shoot any enemy that happens to, say, stand in front of a right (or wrong, for him) window. The game also gives you star ratings for each level, and there are additional achievements, such as completing a level with a single trooper, so I find the replay value is very good. Recommended!

												Really nice squad level pause-enabled RTS with a SWAT theme. I've played both this and Breach and Clear and like both but Door Kickers gives you a little more control over precision operations. Think of a top-down Rainbow Six, with role-playing game elements too. Very addicting for those interested in this type of game, and with lots to do: plenty of single missions with achievements, several campaigns, a random scenario generator, and a map maker. There are already many user-made contributions to the community. The developer really seems to enjoy working on this game and there is what seems to be pretty good involvement on their site's bulletin board. This game is a steal on sale and bargain even at regular price.			"

Before the mission you picking troopers and gear like it was in SWAT4, and mission gameplay is very similar to Frozen Synapse, but here you can set pause whenever you want.The game has a lot of content: 5 classes of troopers, lots of unlockable guns, 3 branches in perks tree, 5 campains, more then 80 single missions, level editor and level generator(!). If it's not enough for you, visit Steam Workshop, there are a lot of extra content created by community. As I can see the game is fully moddable - guns mods, realism mods and visual mods are available.Game control is very tabletishh, but as i can see there is no tablet version of this game. Another bad thing is that Door Kickers is single player game only, but as written in description of the game - ""(but MP might come later)"".4/5			"

												A fantastic squad-based shooter. I played both this and Breach and Clear in close proximity to one another and love the flexibility Door Kickers in how you play it - you can play it as nearly a RTS and give commands on the fly (though you can't give commands to bulk groups of folks) or you can draft a single plan for the entire mission for all of your troopers - complete with commands to synchronize actions - or anywhere in between (I tend to plot out the first room or two and then react dynamically to whatever is happening by pausing and drawing up new plans for the next few seconds).Cons - you do tend to see the same layouts over and over again - even with random missions, troopers aren't radically different from one another in their personalities.I also wish that there was some form of negotiation option to try to talk to folks while also inserting your SWAT team and performing recon or stealth takedowns - something approaching aspects of SWAT 2 with occasional non-violent resolutions. I do wish that more missions featured 4 man teams.Great tactical game and an absolute blast. Very much recommend this title.			"

												    Door Kickers. Tactical, top down simulation game in which you are in full control of a highly trained SWAT team. Oh yeah, it's brilliant.    The objectives are usually very straight-forward: eliminate all hostiles (or tangos, as they call them), save the captives and/or apprehend the suspects(s). However, every level offers a new location, with unpredictable enemy spawns and new tactics to be developed. Over time and the completion of missions four new classes will be unlocked: Pointman (the starter  class), Assualter (essentially a Pointman with an assualt rifle), Shield (carries a tactical shield which takes most damage), Breacher (shotgun wielding units for close quarters combat and making dramatic entrances) and Stealth (probably the most dynamic, effective classes, although more difficult to design practical tactics for). Stars earned in finishing levels quickly and with minimal casualties can be spent on new weapons and tools.     The main thing to know is the freedom that this game offers. There are so many ways to fulfil objectives that it is unlikely that in a group of 100 people (maybe even more), one person will use the same tactics and methods of completing the mission. You can choose what units you use, where to put them, where to move them from there, how to enter a building, when to enter a building, and many more.     There are, however, a few cons to this game. For instance, it is very common for the game to quit responding while launching for the first time in a while. After quiting and relaunching all is normally resolved, though it is worth mentioning. Also, unit control occasionally will act up, allowing me to only control one officer at once. A simple quit of the level will normally fix the issue though. I am fully aware of how unimportant these are, and in turn will note these are not significant enough to be a reason to not purchase the game.    All in all, Door Kickers is a marvelous example of how games of the genre should be, and deserves more attention. I would give it 9/10. Well done, Killhouse.			"

												This is a game that could have made soo much more fun for me but sadly they made 1 stupid story mission impossible for me to successfully make it thru without getting one of my soldiers killed. It is not only the point that I didnt made that particular mission, but this mission made me feel like any weapon you achieve and any soldier you upgrade - well that all this doesnt matter. There are heavy foes that sometimes (if they want to kill) your whole squad OR if you lucky get killed like stupid dolls - there is just such a big random luck factor that I dearly dislike: 1. enemys will behave and spawn differently each time you start a map 2. your guys sometimes kill 10 heavy guys in a row without getting shot and you dont even really aim that prezisely at them, and sometimes they get killed by one guy but having the same equipment worn as with the previous with which you had killed 10 foes in a row and at the same areas and stuff. 3. I played the whole non story mission stuff and unlocked good guns, armor but it rarely made an impact on that one particular mission. Plus, I leveld my soldiers too.I was at a point were I really began to love this game - but now I hate it thoroughly - now it seems to me that I've wasted a lot of time for nothing. I deleted it and I never want to play this game again.  "

Rank: 7.5/10Recommendation(s): Be roughly familiar with firearms terminology.Major Theme: Well constructed, UGC friendly, top down tactics shooter.Bought at Price: $5.50 (Steam Sale)I quite enjoyed this game, but I certainly wouldn’t place it into the “must play” or “should play” for most people.

If you are not familiar with some of the firearms terminology used extensively throughout the game, you will find that things don’t make sense. One such example is level III vs. IIIA armor. There’s a wide selection of gear to pick from (a surprise in such games), and purely picking based on stats and names will lend you a bad time.That being said, 12 hours of gameplay certainly gets across the point of the game, and that’s where you should find yourself with a complete campaign, and all the weapons you want unlocked.

Unlocks in this game are very much like other games in this genre, where points/stars from mission ratings allow you to unlock gear and weapons. If you end up doing poorly, you will obviously receive fewer stars and thus less gear and weapons.Levels and campaigns are unique and interesting – but just as in Breach & Clear – the maps could do with more dynamic elements to them. Perhaps this will be explored in Door Kickers 2?

To tide players over until the release of the next game, Door Kickers extensively supports user generated content (UGC), where you can add more maps, UI changes, and core gameplay changes as well. The level editor could have used more polish, but certainly does get the job done.Just recently I have noticed stuttering in my game for a few seconds here and there. I haven’t been able to track down the source of this, but it’s manageable. Your experience will most likely be different in this regard.If you are in a tussle in choosing between Door Kickers and Breach & Clear, I would recommend Door Kickers. You can see my review on the other game, as well as note the large difference in playtime I have.			"

												This' a great game that reminds me of Swat 4 I have played this game for many hours to only finish the skirmishes I still havent played the campaign, with many more skirmishes coming excluding all the community mods.Pros:-- Lots of replayability - Lots of weapons, equipment, unit potrate art and 5 unique classes- Strategic Cons:-- The SWAT team is slightly trigger happy they'd rather kill you than arrest you. (American Police?)- If I want to arrest someone I have to equip taser, shoot, manually (breaks gameflow and orignal plan execution) order them to arrest criminal then switch back to main weapon. The arresting mechanic would have been better if after a flashbang you can scream ""everyone down"" or shoot the leg or arm but no its only as I stated earlier.- After the sledgehammer and bolt cutters are deployed the swat member freezes for about 3 seconds instead of getting out of the way making them a target to enemy fire immediately dying. The developers could have had them automatically move out the way instead of just standing there getting killed simtanously preventing his teammates shooting back. Non of the cons are game breakers there are ways around them but if it wasnt for the cons this game would have been perfect.			"

A review for ""Door Kickers""What is ""Door Kickers""? As you probably already know - it is tactical real-time strategy that puts you in command of a SWAT squad. Of course, this game has some squad based mechanics that are similar to ones of games like XCOM (managing squad, class system, various equipment, leveling up, researching new skills, etc.). However, unlike XCOM, the gameplay here is real-time based which makes it much more engaging. The way orders to units are given can be a bit complicated, but soon you will realize that it's quite simple. Talking about controlling units, you can prepare a plan for them before starting the mission or you can give orders on the go; it's all up to you. The game has a lot of missions and most of them are quite challenging. There is also a random level generator and, if you are creative person, you can use the tool for creating custom levels. All in all, the game is really nice; the only downside is grafics quality - It's not that bad but it could be more deatailed. I would not recommend buying this game for it's full price, but be sure to grab it when it's on sale.My rating: 8/10P.S. By the way, this game also has a ""replay"" feature, that allows you, upon successful completion of the mission, to watch how your SWAT team swiftly secured the building and saved hostages and even save the replay as a videofile.

												This gamme is a game that I personally have been following since the very earliest of early access for it. This game is a fantastic 2D swat strategy game. You go into a mission, observe your environment, see what soldiers should be sent in and at what locations they should be sent in at. This game requires though to complete the variety of mission types with maximum efficiency. This game has given me hours of fun and frustation in equal amounts. This game constantly provides me with the thrill of split second decisions that could save a man or cause them all to die. Now that this game is officially out it has all the features that I myself have been waiting for, this includes multiple campaigns, troop customisation, leveling your squads, a random mission generator, and hours of enjoyment as you hone yours and your soldiers abilities. Overall I feel this game is worth every penny.			"

												I like what this game going for.  However, I have several problems with this game.Editing paths when making a plan  is a hassle.  I wish it was something I can overlook but since it's the main tool to use in the game,  I can't.  It's not efficient so you have to workaround the problems with UI. I really hope they clean this up with door kickers 2, if not then I'll be pretty disappointed with that game.  I don't think this game would have such positive reviews if everyone had to finish the missions without pausing since the there are several issues with UI.I like how the AI reacts to your actions such as busting down a door.  I'm not too fond of them being able to spawn in random/different locations.  The reason for this is because it can be tedious coming up with a solid plan as editing paths are a pain. If they imrpove the UI in door kickers 2 then I wouldn't mind random spawns for enemies.  You may find several problems with your plan if it involves flashbangs.   Switching between pause and real time sort of eliminates some of the problems that come up when making a plan.   It's cool in a way, I'm glad it's there, but then it's not really challenging.  $15 would be a more appropriate price tag in my opinion.  BUGS:An obnoxious buzzing sound that won't go away happens often when loading a new level.  Usually, it goes away when you restart so it's not a big issue.  But I saw iron man mode? that you can enable and I believe it mentioned something about not being allowed to restart missions.  I don't know if it causes a problem there.			"

								""If you are considering a tactical squad based shooter to go in your steam list, this is the best I've seen in a while.""well, I've been a fan of early access for a while to my detrement. I like the system of replaying a game because it updated i guess, but this game is a hidden gem in a pile of coal. the way they made and make this game allows for easy to play hard to master and really makes you plan before attacking instead of just charging in. While playing i kept finishing a mission then watching the replay of the game just to see how i could've tightened up my movement, get more efficient kills and and avoid making mistakes I made before. For example; I played a garage map, and I breached this one room to stun and rush the enemy down, I ignored the bathroom assuming it was empty and it appears there was one terrorist in the room that walked out and killed one of my guys.However this game does have some downfalls. I feel the developers planned, and probably still plan to, get the player to attach to certain characters and troops. Sadly, I don't get that from this game. The gear also seems quite one sided, having your breachers to equip semi-auto shotguns because its more efficient and equipping the stronger gear so that you have less chance of failure. Perhaps a technology tree so that you can move to those stronger weapons would help, or just balancing the guns all out.Aside the problems I do like this game enough to follow through the development and play i every update so i don't miss anything, I really like what they've done already and the future plans sounds fantastic.

												Door kickers is a game about kicking doors and shoot up the place...no really it's pretty much that. The game has you planning and executing plans from a top down view in which you can setup your teams of Swat officers and plan their route to breach, bang and clear the mission. Want to deal with a room full of enemies watching the doors? Simple you can set your 2 teams of officers to each door and have them kick the door in or blow the door open, then flash and start shooting everyone dead. It feels wonderful.==========The Good==========1. Gameplay - Having this feeling of being a swat team commander or a tactical planner is rather fun but also difficult as you must plan every step to ensure the mission goes to plan. You have to adapt to the situation because if you don't you can get your team killed or a hostage. Lucky the game gives you many options to do your job, you can customize your officers giving them from aggressive equipment such as riot shields, grenades, breaching charges and your weapons of choice from SMG to shotguns. However you also can go in more passive using stun grenades, tasers or even take everyone out quietly with silencers to make it as if you were never there.It goes the same with planning the mission, you can plan every step, every choice such as blowing up a door, using flash or grenade or just kick doors. You can also set it where you can play the mission yourself having full control over each unit in real time or you can set everything up with waypoints and execution orders (they allow you to set up when to breach or move out or hold a location) and simply watch your plan come to life. 2. Levels - I found the level designs rather fun and enjoyable. You have levels with multiple floors, some with windows in which sometimes you have a sniper element that can help take out targets for you. And on top of that you can use their ingame map editor to make your own crazy missions. There are also a lot of missions to play through and 3 stories to go through with the cool element of if you lose an officer...they stay dead...no replacement making it a bit more challenging.=======The 50/50=======1. Difficulty - There are times where missions can feel very difficult and needs the best plan or just luck to win. This can be annoying at times but overall it helps fuels the challenge of being a tactical planner. For example there are missions where you must save a hostage and disarm a bomb however if you plan the mission poorly you can end up having a hostage shot or the bomb going off before you reach it...making timing everything. So expect to re-work your plans over and over.======Overall======It's a fun police type tactical shooter for those wanting to either take control of each unit and do everything real time or be a planner and watch your plan go to work. There is again a lot of customization and maps to play to keep you busy and most of all a lot of enemies to deal with.   "

												85/100Solid SWAT game..(very similar to ""Breach & Clear"", but view from above like ""Frozen Synapse"")easy to spend 30+hours without even touching the Campaign ;)PRO:-Quite realistic Level-Design (decorations, surroundings, sounds, ..)-Different classes for each merc (can be changed fast before missions)-Favorite Template for each class can be saved -> faster adjustment of merc equipment-Completing missions earns you points (1-3 depending on your performance)-Extra Challenges for each mission get you additional EXP-lots of weapons to enable (for earned points)CON:-Skill development is maxed at lvl 21-Some missions are plain unfair-Some weapons+skills are not worth it (too weak)-A few missions+challenges are just possible after hours of reloadingI recommend it for anyone loving Stealth games, especially Breach´n Clear , Frozen Synapse and similar games.Birdview from above might not be as much enjoyable though ,if you´re used to 3D Stealth-action aka Splinter Cell /Metal Gear /..

While playing trough the different campaigns or single missions you earn points to spend on your equipment and your doctrine. It includes a map editor and an active mod community. "

												I have to say, for its worth, it's a pretty solid and sure game. Interesting take on the ""breach and secure"" scenarios presented with Law-enforcement/Police agencies. Complicated at first, however given time and some basic understanding, works out pretty well, and thus allows for more complex operations to be tried out!Really good, I quite like it, nice little tactical-top-down breach and clear game. First of it's kind to address this kind of genre, from what I can see.Thumbs up all round!			"

												I got this game in early September 2013, when it was in early access. I liked it as it was then (and it was well worth the rather cheap price at that point), and it has only improved. I see that it won best tactics game of 2014, and this makes me feel a little pride, knowing that I have supported it from the beginning :) Your team is pretty customizable. You can rename each trooper, select from a number of different portraits, choose each trooper's class, and also customize their equipment and weapon loadout. There are several different campaigns to undertake, each with different focuses, enemies, and situations. There's also a bunch of individual missions you can try. For extras, there is a mission generator, map editor, and you have access to the workshop. You can download maps, etc from the workshop which is always nice. The gameplay is characterized by pausing and unpausing (or, not). You can pause, and while paused click and drag each trooper's path through the level, designating actions to do once they reach a door (like flashbanging it and clearing), which way to scan when they reach a certain point, and so forth. You can map out as much or as little at a time as you want. There is a bonus if you successfully run through the level fully mapping it out in the beginning, and not interfering. There's also a bonus for completing the level with just 1 trooper. Hopefully this makes sense. The selection of equipment and tools, combined with classes, can make for plenty of replay value. You could run 1 level many different ways depending on which troopers you use, what equipment they have, and how they enter a building, room, or area. For instance you might run the level very differently if you have one or two stealth troopers on the mission, than if you have a pointman with a pistol, assaulter with a rifle, or breacher with a shotgun. I certainly recommend this game. "

												Rainbow Six planning phase as a refined standalone game.This is a top-down pausable real-time strategy where you guide a squad of special forces through various missions (hostage rescue, bomb defusal, arrests, evidence grab or plain good old terrorist hunt). Before the start of the mission you are able to set up a plan and then watch it play out - however you can adjust it to your liking at any moment and have a limited direct control of separate fighters. Furthermore every fighter is customizable with the ability to select a loadout suitable for various tasks (akin to SWAT4).The game comes with several campaigns and a huge amount of single missions, as well as a battle generator. Missions have a degree of replayability due to random enemy positions and numbers each time. If that's not enough there is a built-in mission editor - meaning you can also download many great user missions from Steam Workshop.Steam Workshop further offers more variety by having mods that add new squad skins, new weapons and gear.The only downside of note is an interface, which no doubt was affected by the mobile version - there's a lot of scrolling and clicking through to get to the stuff you want, especially after you've installed some mods. The game also gets repetitive after a while - same as its ""bigger"" brethren - classic R6 and SWAT series.			"

												Door Kickers is a top-down real-time tactical shooter (shooter in leiu of a more appropriate term - the shooting is automatic and your buds are very competent at running and gunning) in which the player controls a team of SWAT (?) (Armed police, S.T.A.R.S., whatevs) operators tasked with completing an objective at a given location.The objectives typically take the form of a. Kill all the bad guys, b. Arrest a certain specific badguy, or c. Rescue a bunch of helpless hostages.  In most cases objectives of the B & C variety can be over-ruled by killing all the bad guys anyway.During each mission, your task is to choose and path your operators through the building/mission-zone.  This involves selecting means of entry, equipping your team with the correct weapons and breach equipment and otherwise generally co-ordinating your buds so they can support each other by fire, hold down certain angles, throw flashbangs and grenades and escort hostages.The over-world gameplay takes the form of a squad roster in which you may allocate each operator to a specific skill class alongside individual stats and some (seemingly inexhaustible) operator avatars.  From here the player can choose to play a single mission, to gain star economy for in-game upgrades, or embark on a longer campaign - a series of missions which, perhaps with the exception of the first, are enormously expansive and super intricate.Gameplay is nice, ergonomic and smooth and for the vast majority entirely mouse driven.  Though played in real time, the mechanics hinge a lot on the ability to pause and re-plot paths for your dudes.  Cheevos await anyone who can execute an entire mission from a single plot-line before the mission.I have only two gripes about the game really. First, the throwing of flashbangs or other grenades through closed doors is somewhat sluggish and counter-intuitive.  Often, though you've set him to peek the door after he throw's the grenade, your trooper will sit idly taking bullets to his non-mobile♥♥♥♥♥Secondly, and perhaps minorly, I would love to be able to export my ossom mission completion playthroughs but this function while tantalising me constantly, is not available on Mac.  Devs, plz fix.These tiny gripes aside, Door Kickers is a fantastically gripping game with a well thought out single player campaign.  The weapons and equipment are good in vanilla and, I must say, enhanced tenfold by Gunworld's IoV - Instruments of Violence item pack.Excellent game.  You'll be engaged for hours.			"

You can stun, arrest, sniper, or go in guns blazing from all angles like a proper swat team and make mince meat out of your enemies. The game also has tonnes of mods. One of my favourite mods is the Rainbow Six sound mod. It brings me back to the end of the 90's / start of 00 when the Tom Clancy games were at their best. Such good memories of the Rainbow six days ""Open, Flash and clear on Zulu"" #Runs in backwards and kills the hostagesAlso the game plays like Hotline Miami, so if you liked that game you'll love this.I can't say much more.

												Step 1- The Planning Phase: Take 15 minutes devising a plan so perfect that the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden would be jealous.Step 2- Execute said plan: ""Alpha is a go!"" Your officers have just entered their designated breaching locations, the plan is executed perfectly.Step 3- Fail: ""Trooper Down!"", ""Trooper Down!"" All of your men have been killed, along with the hostage they were sent to save. Mission Failed. Step 4- Cry: Wet your keyboard with tears.Step 5- Retry the mission until rage consumes you.All in all it's a great game. It feels very rewarding when a plan is finally executed perfectly, and even failing makes you want to keep trying until you succeed. 10/10			"

												Good game, many levels, hard challenges.I enjoyed the game a lot.But: Plan ahead, adjust when needed - this sounds nice.The downside to this: once you interact directly, all the detailed and time-consuming plan is voided.So one has to start to micro-manage :-(And especially for the harder/later levels: as time is often being limited, not all angles can be covered all the time.Together with random factors ... your plan might still work out once in a while just by luck.So replay often enough and ""Fortuna"" might roll the dices in your favor once.Call that realistic, but it started to annoy me.That said, good game and also an easy one to get back in.

												First of All, I really love this game. Fantastic. So I cant completely see the negative sides to this game. However I will try my best at looking at the good and bad points of the game.Pro:Very tactical gameplay. The gameplay is very much a learning experience because you learn through doing missions for example that different methods of destructing doors are important if you want to sneak in, or breach in and kill everyone in 2 seconds. Good soundtracks. I personally think that the soundtrack works greatly with the game and makes the game more interesting.Good voices. All your soldiers have voices to which adds a personality to the characters you play with.Con:Some minor bugs such as crashing after clicking to often or the soundtrack hanging up and repating one note for 10 seconds. Well its top down view. I personally like top down view but I would understand if people dont like that. However I dont understand why you would buy the game if you didnt like top down view.			"

												Anyone who wants a well styled and easy to learn but hard to master game , Door Kickers should be next on your buy list. When the game is first played many feel the top down style would only hinder the experience if anything it only enhances it as it makes you feel you have complete control over the situation creating a awesome experience.Easy controls make the first few levels a walk in the park but full on hostage situations where the criminals are armed to teeth your going to need a plan from the start. Nothing is more satisfying than clearing a room full of gang members, defusing a bomb and then getting that 3 star rating.			"

												The full price of $19.99 is a little expensive in my opinion however at 85% off during the summer sale this game is only $2.99 and it is well worth it. Door Kickers is a very nicely made strategy game with multiple classes of units such as assaulters with automatic rifles and breachers who carry a shield and are more resilient to enemy fire. When Starting a level you can attempt to plan the whole mission out from start to finish or micromanage your unitis in real time. You are also able to pause the action to adjust your plan if needed at any point during a level.			"

Early Access Review
								I highly recommend this game, it's awesome! Even being in Early Access. Usually I'm pretty hesitant on buying Early Access titles, but I was pleasantly surprised by this game. I used to play alot of Frozen Synapse - its just my kind of game. The top down perspective allows me to practice the tactics I training I received in the Marines. And you'll hear that alot from some players: that they play the game exactly the way they would react and conduct these situation in reality. It's no surprise to me that they've gotten a contract to create a simulation title specifically for military and law enforcement, the expressed purpose to be for training and small unit tactics.Guys, if you're into individual tactics and clearing a building room by room, as well as the intensity involved in jusst not knowing what may be around the next corner for your men, this is the game for you. I purchased the stuff of legends package from their site, which allowed me to not only have a portrait of me in the game for the troopers, but also gave me feature voting rights in the forums. Trust me, the final game is gonna be awesome! It's worth every penny you'll be paying for it.			"

								This is one of the best games ever. I'm not kidding. I have quite a few games; all Battlefields, CS:GO, Rust, DayZ, numerous race games, all Hitmans, but I prefer this game. Why?Well, I love this game, you can play it anytime, any duration that you like. Spend fifteen minutes on a plan, or just rush in and control all the troopers in real-time. I prefer a combination, planning a bit ahead and then work further in real-time.Cons:- I like the police versus criminals idea- I like the old-fashion top-down view- I like that you (new feature!) can throw grenades and flashbangs around corners- I like the ballistic shields and different weapons- I like the different roles (shotgun, rifle, pistol, etc.)What should improve:Nothing in general, it's a good game.

								Door Kickers is an Action/Strategy game which puts you in command of a S.W.A.T. team. you must use planning and tactics to complete the objective (such as rescuing hostages or defusing a bomb) and keep your squad alive.The game is played from a top-down perspective and nearly all of the missions revolve around storming a building. there is a variety of weapons and gadgets to aid you in completing the objective. ( such as spy camera's to look under doors, or flashbangs to temporarily blind enemies) With the introduction of BETA. you can now customise the appearance of the member of your squad. as well as change their names and callsigns.The game also includes a sort of skill tree which allows you to grant extra skills to your squad using points earned by completing levels. there is a variety of skills and more will be implemented as the game develops. (My favourite skill is the one that allows stealth members to hold fire until ordered to shoot)The game also includes different types of S.W.A.T. members. like shotgunners. assualters. stealth ETC. each mission is different and requires careful planning and certain classes will be more efffective than others.finally the game features steam workshop integration. making it possible to create and download user created maps, weapons, gadgets and more!In conclusion. this is a game that is definately worth buying. if you like strategy games. You will like this. The game is currently in BETA and will be updated to include more gear and a campaign mode. i definately recommend it.			"

 Door Kickers! It's a late night, I ned sleep, but instead I'm writing reviews.  Why? Anyway, I'll make it a moderate sized review I guess, TL;DR at the bottom. Instead of going over every detail like other reviews, I'll go over the little  nooks and crannies only , and not in any order, so let's get to it!  I have a lot more hours on Door Kickers than it seems, I've played the iPad version a lot and lots of offline hours. Progession This game is pretty nice on progression to be honest. You have one class (I'll go over the classes in a second} and as your squad ""levels"" up, you obtain new classes,  until you get all 5 of them. There are also  stars , which you get for completing certain challenges, such as playing the mission using a single plan, or playing without ever pausing in real-life. With stars, you can buy  new weapons, armor and pretty much everything else . Every time your squad levels up, you get  doctorine points . These can be used to teach our squad special tactics, making them more effective.  Replayablity This game has a  nice freaking sheet  ton of replayablity. The AI makes  different decisions  and spawn in different preset spots (so they  can and will  repeat). There are a ridiculous amount of ways to complete each mission, be it with continuous sync throughout, splitting up to speed it up, or just trying out the best weapons for every situation!  Let's not forget that there's a  ♥♥♥♥ing mission generator  that ♥♥♥♥♥ out missions for you to play that feel like a normal one! Also the steam workshop is utilized pretty well so you can find lots of maps made by people using the level editor. Music   Meh.  The music is alright, but then it just starts turning into some dubstep crap, but if you're fine with a 60 seconds of dubstep or just love it in general, then you'll like it. Gamemodes (WIP)These are the gamemodes you'll play  Clear Hostiles Hostage Rescue Stop Execution Bomb DefusalArrest WarrentDope RaidsRobbery In Progress Some of the above, on a ship or plane or something really cool like that. WIP YEs, I'm tired, I'd appreciate a like or two pretty please though! I'll work on it very soon! "

												I'm not one to write many reviews nor do I often play tactics based games like this.  The fact that I am writing a positive review for this game refelects how enjoyable I have found it.  I love the level challenges and find that the difficulty is set just right.  My biggest disappointment is that a very well thought out run can be won or lost by the random location of enemies and/or the enemies' marksmanship.  Sometimes you can blitz through a level with impressive results but re-run a level you only needed a minor tweak to, in order to improve your time, can result in you looping thorugh the exact same plan 30 times before it works again.There are so many areas to work with and a varied set of levels, plus the ability to make your own or import others, that it keeps you playing.  The RPG like development of team members also adds a good dimension to the gameplay, especially if you play through all the levels with a single squad memberOverall I'd give this game 8 out of 10, the effect of randomising the enemies being the main issue.  I don't expect it to be exactly the same every time but it needs to reduce the luck factor.			"

												Awesome game, simple graphics, 2D, and yet very fun. It's a tactical strategy game where you customize your own squad, names, callsigns, loadouts, and roles (like shield, stealth, assaulter, breacher and pointman) and assign them to missions, and there are a ton of missions, premade missions, campaigns, community-made missions, mission generator and mission editor as well. The replayability is enormous and you can just keep playing different missions for hours.Different objectives like hostages, bomb defusals, pure hostile killing, etc, The design of the plan system is very nice and well-made, you can plan out tactics and pause at any time of the game. You can make a whole plan from the start of the mission, or you can play a more real-time playstyle where your plan is improvised as the operation goes, or a combination of both.If you are interested in conducting anti-terrorist/crime operations(e.g. SWAT) and is not too picky with the graphics, you should definitely give this a try.  It's got the Rainbow Six/SWAT atmosphere but the gameplay style of XCOM converted to real-time.8/10			"

												Addictive little tactics game with some smooth action.  This game simulates a bust like on the Wire, or Hill Street Blues. Where the cops beat down the door and then run to catch the perps in the act, and stop them destroying the evidence, or killing hostages. I like how it builds up the anticipation of what lies behind a door, and then the thrill from the controlled burst of violence necessary to subdue whoever is in there. There are single missions and a campaign. The campaigns, so far, are really just loosely tied together single missions.  But, this is fine if you’re looking for action and tactics and not much story.The game has many mods and comes with a cool looking editor, for those who want to get lots of replay. I would love to see a sequel set in Rio de Janeiro or somewhere.  "

												The full price of $19.99 is a little expensive in my opinion however at 85% off during the summer sale this game is only $2.99 and it is well worth it. Door Kickers is a very nicely made strategy game with multiple classes of units such as assaulters with automatic rifles and breachers who carry a shield and are more resilient to enemy fire. When Starting a level you can attempt to plan the whole mission out from start to finish or micromanage your unitis in real time. You are also able to pause the action to adjust your plan if needed at any point during a level.			"

												Very good game. Only flaw is that if you want to do all the challenges (not pausing, everything in one go) the planning gets a little fiddly.Disclaimer: I found a translation mistake and got an additional key as reward. I don't think thats a big deal but better save than sorry.			"

												Lieutenant Wahyu organizes the invasion of an apartment building that is the safe house of the powerful and cruel drug lord Tama and his gang. The SWAT team breaks in the building but one lookout sees and warns the gangsters and the police force is trapped on the seventh floor. They learn that Lt. Wahyu has not informed his superiors about the operation. Now the police officers have to fight with limited ammunition against the armed and dangerous gangsters.IMDB : 7.6 / 10Pros :- Above scenario is doable in this game- No annoying UI panel- Level up. Each squad member has its own stats that increased for each level- MODSCons :- New squad member is Rookie- Tutorial is a bit confusing10/10 my assault plan could become The Raid scenario			"

												My enjoyment of this game followed an inverted bell curve - at first I was elated. The dip came somewhere between my 20th and 30th mission, where the difficulty started ramping up faster than I could cope with. I was quite frustrated for a while but kept trying to wade forward. And sure enough, once my knowledge of the game mechanics accumulated past a certain critical mass it was only upwards on that bell curve, toward permanent satisfaction. To limit the length of this review, I'd like to touch up only on things that I didn't like as I'm sure the positives are thoroughly described by others. there are no collisions between units. While this makes the game easier, I kinda expected having to manage this aspect of CQB - avoiding a jam when moving in cramped spaces. And here instead you can stack your whole squad on one space like some sort of Shiva with 20 arms, wielding 8 guns, 2 tasers and a shield. And it's a very valid tactic. as an aside to the above, there is also no friendly fire though I don't mind. there are multi-layered levels (ex. a house with an additional floor) but time moves forward only on the floor you are observing. This is an engine deficiency acknowledged by the devs and it's here to stay. Sort of embarassing. the interface used for drawing paths is pretty clunky. It's hard to use precisely, and even harder if you're trying to map out a complicated plan in a tight space because of all the markers. It took me like 3 hours and some googling to figure out how to strafe. The option to ""bend"" an existing path is either missing or I haven't found it.  there is a fair amount of bugs, particularly related to handcuffing. in the hardest, endgame levels you are kinda undergunned and seriously struggling to defeat the body armor of enemies. I appreciate that police arsenals are not the same as military, yet it feels wrong. there is a bit too much randomness in the outcome of firefights. Even the best plan will sometimes be defeated by RNG.But yeah, in the end I agree with the Overwhelmingly Positive rating. This game will satisfy almost any fan of tactical combat. It's extremely addictive and feels rewarding to improve in.			"

												I had the pleasure of looking at DoorKickers way back in Alpha and then again at the full release version. I'm glad it made it all the way through. It reminds me a lot of the tactical planner in pre-Raven Shield Rainbow Six games. You can carefully plan out your teams entry into an area swarming of enemies and maybe even hostages or adapt a plan on the fly. It can be pretty challenging too! The game has a fair amount of pre-made content for the price and also offers a stage builder to extend that further. KillHouse Games provided me with a review copy to produce a first impressions video. If you'd like to see the game in motion and hear some more thoughts consider checking out the video below.

								Very good tactical/party based strategy game with RPG elements like skill trees, recruits level up as they get experience, etc. For the low price, game is a great RTS with pause abilities so you can, if you wish, plan out the teams strategy until the guestimated end of a situation, hit the play button and issue ""Go Commands"" with num pad buttons without ever needing to play it like a turn based strategy.This game has a suprising amount of depth, steam workshop support with great themed addons(WW2 weapons, etc.) randomized scenarios which really keeps the game alive for me, and a full fledged campaign which I actually enjoyed playing through for the first time in awhile, even though none of my recruits survived from the first mission, to last mission, I still had veteran officers due to the games class/leveling system. Also re-placement of an officer in barracks  with a new recruit after you loose someone on a mission, can really throw a wrench in your long term plans in the campaign. Which only adds more depth and a desire to complete missions without loosing any of your team, which gives you a reason to go back and get that 5 star mission rating that was too hard earlier in the game, while you use said mission to train new veterans.

								Nice Job!  This is a genuinely fun game that makes me think back to hours of Rainbow 6 with friends trying to get those missions planned out perfectly.Having served in the Army, and been trained in breach and clear operations,  I can say that a lot of the features felt very intuitive and I was pleased to see that the techniques I'd learned were very effective in the game.  The only thing that would make this more satisfying was if there was a bit of a narrative to tie everything together as the missions do feel a bit disjointed from each other and you (so far) dont seem to have any other objectives besides kill everyone.  Would be nice to do some hostage extraction, non-lethal takedowns, or arrest of an indivudual and get out without fighting everyone.  Of course I've only been playing for about an hour or so, so that could be coming or in the works.!   Great job!			"

I very nearly bought the mobile version until i realised it is available on steam. this is the only game that has ever made me feel guilty about a sale its perfect for both keyboard and tablet modes on my surface, So far I can only see one fault with it. in the first campain I failed a specific mission over and over again because my units could not fire fast enough so the hostage kept getting executed. however it has a level builder, mod support, 6 campaigns with more on the way and loads of loadout possibilitiesthis game is well worth the £15 I should have paid for it rather than the £2 from the sale			"

It's pretty awesome and at least a little bit addictive.If there's one criticism I'd have, it's that it could really use more varied voices. I'd actually be happy if they released a payable DLC that added south american drug cartel voices, arab terrorists, yakuza or triad mobsters, tchechen terrorists etc. If they could also add more voices for the swat team it would be fantastic.

												This is probably one of the most satisfying strategy games of all time.I just finished a mission with one single plan, without pausing, and got 3 stars. I felt like a badass, and I am now going to watch the replay and gloat.It took me a bit to get my head around the controls, but now they work great.I've only just started playing, so I'm on easier single missions, but there is just so much gameplay here between the included missions, campaigns, and various mods.In addition, I'm usually only coordinating 2 agents. There are a much more difficult missions with many more agents to plan and coordinate with, so there is some seriously deep tactical gameplay here.This looks very similar to Breach & Clear, so if you thought, like me, that it was a copy or something, you were wrong. While it has a free pause, so it can feel turn based, you can also go real time. It allows for a range of playstyles depending on your tastes. In addition, the lack of grid based movement ends up being a huge plus.Buy it.			"

A lot less fiddly/granular than Frozen Synapse but this makes it more fun somehow.

												Really impressed by this game, simple but damn fun with good tactical mechanics. Endless missions thanks to the workshop, a generator and editor. What more could you ask for really, I picked this up during the sale and am not dissappointed in the slightest. If you want something for casual gaming then this could be it, don't be fooled by the tablet look as it was built for PC and then just recently ported to tablet and touchscreen. 10/10 - Unanimously Approved!

												This game is great!I did get it on sale for 85% off, I don't think it would be worth the full price, but then again I must admit I'm cheap.Door Kickers involves strategically moving your SWAT units, taking down terrorists, rescuing hostages and more!I must say that the random map generator can be buggy at times because it may create a room with no doors to access the inside of the room, but from what I have seen, this bug is very rare.So if this is ever on-sale I consider this game a must-buy for strategy fans, and if you still aren't sure if you are going to like it, there are always other reviews, youtube videos, and the steam refund system to help you make your choice. So what do you have to lose? Give it a go! "

So, you'll be repeating the same routine quite often ... then the game throws you a curve ball.

												Ich habe das Spiel einige Zeit beobachtet. Das Grundkonzept hat mich von Anfang an angesprochen jedoch war ich sehr skeptisch was die Umsetzung anbelangt. Nach vielem hin und her habe ich im Sale zugeschlagen und muss sagen: Es lohnt sich. Natürlich nur für diejenigen die auf diese Art von spielen abfahren. Im Grunde ist es eine Huldigung an Spiele wie Rainbow Six oder SWAT. Trotzdem ist es eben was eigenes. Man könnte auch sagen man hat viel aus wenig gemacht und das Spiel ist der beste Beweis das es eben nicht immer tripple A Grafik sein muss um zu überzeugen. Die Spielmechanik ist einfach und intuitiv und schafft es mit wenig viel zu erreichen. Keine Komplexen Fingerverreckungen um einen Zugriff zu planen. Viel mehr ein rundes Interface das man schnell verinnerlicht. Die Soundkulisse ist gut wenn auch nicht perfekt. Wenn während eines Zugriffs ständig der gleiche Hintergrund-Loop abläuft können einem sogar US Sirenen mitunter auf den Keks gehen.Eine große Auswahl an Missionen in Verbindung mit einer ausreichenden Auswahl an Ausrüstung u. Waffen lassen einem genug freiraum und wem das nicht reicht der kann sich ja mit dem Editor befassen. Dazu kann ich allerdings noch gar nichts sagen da ich mich damit noch nicht befasst habe. Fazit: Ein feines Game für Fans des Genre, für alle anderen etwas das man im Sale ruhig mal ergattern kann jedoch beim Vollpreis wohl er nicht überzeugen wird. "

This makes every life important and the strategies ever more important.. As a bad strategy could mean the death of an operator.. Or worse, Many operators..

												Team Alpha, go! Bravo, engage!Pros:- Doorkickers has a very great tactical element to it, allowing you to utilize unit sight lines to spy corners before entering and taking out the baddies before shots are fired. Using multiple units for cover and movement through doorways, flashing, flanking is very fun and very satisfying when it all goes according to the plan in your mind. - The different classes to combine on missions is very interesting and with mobility meters could spell the difference between a good outcome on a mission or a very fatal end.- Utilization of ""Go-Codes"" is always exciting when you are able to time your plan sequences in a smooth, fluid execution.- There is a SKILL tree and Doctrine points to purchase weapons and gear (only once) for all of your units to use- Lots of maps and creatable content to share with Steam friends and community. Cons:- I have to admit, sometimes the units can be a bit finnicky, and it gets a bit frustrating; there are two tangos in a large room on the other side of a locked door you cannot flashbang through - breaching with a hammer, lockpick, or breaching charge takes too much time to set up, you send a man through and direct his sight line to sweep, but instead of firing on the first guy he sees on side A, sweeps and shoots man in corner B instead and leaves the first man he sees in the shadows. Alongside the factor of friendly fire sight lines, its frustrating when you have 2 of your own units stacked on top of each other, but one will not fire in his designated direction due to a teammate being directly on top of him.- I've found that enemy units are able to fire simultaneously and hit my units while they are in a line, while my units cannot fire through each other. Something I think will be patched in the future.- Another issue I'm having is pathing selections: there are times where lines will overlap in a hallway and you wnat to change the sight line of ONE of your units, but you can't select his pathing line because the OTHER guys' line is on top of his. I tried to lock one unit's path with SHIFT, but doesn't seem to work. Something that can be fixed.Conclusion:All in all, I REALLY do enjoy the game. For $20? Sure. I honestly feel the game's INCLUDED content could have been more, the campaigns are a bit short, but the replayability with different tactics is refreshing. The focus on community map content is a bit harrowing, as I'm not one to really have time to download and configure all of it to work. I also feel that each class should have their own type of special ability in relation with the skill trees, instead of just access to a certain type of primary weapon. Different stat fluctuations, maybe? I don't know. It's still a great game to kill time and terrorists with.			"

												WITHIN 2 HOURS: DOORKICKERSALL THE YESIt is a top-town tactical shooter where the goal is to complete CS like objectives against the clock and freindly bodycountThe gameplay when you manage to control the rather hectic command interface is really cool and rewarding as you are able to plan where your own custom SWAT team goes to looks and use items to interact with the maps, Say A guy flashbangs a large room and everyone piles in, You waste a bunch of terrorists but don't check your corners as well as you could have and a hidden good picks a guy off with an innacurate burst of SMG fire but he gets picked off and you complete the missionIt is all about how well you are able to use your team and their equipment at hand to deal with the threat on the map and it is glorousAnd the progression and replay value at a glance looks great too as there is a very wide variety of weapons avalible for each of all the 4 unique classes in the game, individual cops (alongside your own progress bar) are able to gain XP on the field leveling up and getting better as the game goes onOverall: ALL MY YES			"

												This game has a lot of annoying UI problems - most of which are minor, but they add up - but other than that it's pretty good.The game mechanics are solid, if a bit unrealistic in parts. For example, enemies can hit you with grenades when you're inside a house and they're outside, down the street. (The grenade appears to go over the exterior wall of a house and through the roof.) Cover isn't very consistent. Some cars give you cover; others don't. It has an iron-man mode, which I appreciate. The unit classes are a bit unbalanced in that some are much more useful than others, but it doesn't matter too much.The game has you executing civilians without warning and without giving them a chance to surrender, so you basically play a bad cop in a police state, but then we're all used to games being murder simulators anyway. The game calls the criminals ""terrorists"", which is about as accurate as calling them ""communists"". I'm slightly bothered by the promotion of terrorist hysteria and the dilution of the word ""terrorist"" into meaninglessness, but oh well.The map designs are pretty good, but it seems that you either need luck or prescience to beat some of them without casualties, which is a bit unfortunate. The game comes with an editor that lets you make your own scenarios and share them for other people to play.The game doesn't have a manual or a decent tutorial, but you can probably figure it out.The developer is very active in the forums and frequently responds to questions, which I greatly appreciate, but I'm not sure how good he is at fixing bugs. (I know of at least one problem that he said would be fixed ""in the next update"", but that was in August 2014 and it's still not fixed as of June 2015. Maybe he forgot or maybe he changed his mind. I don't know.)The existing campaigns and missions seem like they'll provide at least 20 hours of play, and there are supposed to be more campaigns coming. I don't know whether the developer will make good on that promise, but it's nice that the game is supposed to continue to grow in the future.Overall, the game has lots of little problems that detract from the enjoyment but even so it's still fun.

												Really a tremendously well-made strategy game around being a SWAT commando. There's a huge amount of content and there's already promises from the developer to add even more. I should add that the developer's openness and availability through things like Twitter make it a lot easier to love this game.It's a great game with solid mechanics. It's a terrific value, and the developers are very friendly/reasonable. Doorkickers is defintely worth getting if you have the slightest amount of interest.			"

												Highly tactical game that is essentially about finding the best way to get your officers to kill all the Druggies, Terrorists, Junkies, etcetera. The action can be fast and brutal, or slow and methodical, with the multiple classes, dozens upon dozens of missions, and all manner of weapons and potential ways to win in the fast-paced gameplay of Door Kickers.Open-ended tactical action with loads of potential gameplay, PLUS Steam Workshop and an active modding community. This didn't win 'Best Tactics 2014' for nothing (Rock Paper Shotgun), and I say it shows. Rainbow Six if it was top-down and you were a floating policeman god, some may say (There's also mods to make it Rainbow Six). There's much more, but this is just the tip of the iceberg, I say.If you like what you're reading, I say go take a look at some (more, if you already have) videos before deciding if you want to spend money on this (because it's smart, of course). Highly recommended for fans of tactical shooters and strategy games alike.Apologies for any major issues or minor errors, I should be asleep. But Door Kickers.			"

												The saviour of tactical shooters. An over the top tactical shooter with loads of content. Over 70+ single missions, three campaigns, workshop levels, random level generator and even a map editor. What you are getting is well worth the pricetag. I mean the name of the game isn't even edgy. So the question is what's stopping you?Pros:+Great replayability+ Tons of content+ Permadeath system for your squad+ Unique feeling for a shooter since it's over the top.Cons:-Can get boring sometimes.-Doesn't offer the exact same feeling of a tactical shooter from first person perspective.

												Well, what should I say? I played this game for quite a long time (mostly cracked (yeah-yeah, I know I know...)) now and after I saw that this game is so cheap at the moment, I instantly bought it. This game is unique. It's pretty intense and there isn't any better feeling if your plan works perfect. Really. Also, you need some time to get throught it. Of course you can do it like Rambo and just run throught the whole map, but if you want to play it right, like a real SWAT Team... oh boy that will be hard! Seriously, it's really hard thanks to the random spawns and co. If you want a game where you need to think about your actions, this game will fit you pretty well. If you want a game with some badass shooting, this game will fit you pretty well. If you just want to kick some doors... well, guess what? This game will fit you extremly well! Seriously, buy that game now, it's way too cheap for such an amazing game!			"

												This game is great!I did get it on sale for 85% off, I don't think it would be worth the full price, but then again I must admit I'm cheap.Door Kickers involves strategically moving your SWAT units, taking down terrorists, rescuing hostages and more!I must say that the random map generator can be buggy at times because it may create a room with no doors to access the inside of the room, but from what I have seen, this bug is very rare.So if this is ever on-sale I consider this game a must-buy for strategy fans, and if you still aren't sure if you are going to like it, there are always other reviews, youtube videos, and the steam refund system to help you make your choice. So what do you have to lose? Give it a go! "

												Doorkickers in an awesome semi-realistic top-down pause/play Urban Ops tactical planning game (a lot of words, i know), focusing on police and counter-terrorism scenarios. It has exceptional value for your money, and the devs are decent enough to actually bring a good game out of early acces. That shouldn't have to be a plus, but it is.Your SWAT team is fully levlable with it's own skill tree, seperate from the leveling of each individual team member, and the unlocking of new gear for your team, which adds to the feeling of progression and depth of the game. There are a LOT of ways to complete most levels, and as you unlock new gear you can go back and solve a scenario in a new and better way, improving replayability. Your team members die permanently (and is replaced by a rookie police officer) if you don't restart a mission where someone died, which gives every tactical decission you make a distinct feeling of importance. For someone with basic experience with military urban ops tactics, gameplay feels intuitive and realistic in that real life techniques and equipment are successfull when applied apropriately within the game. It's rewarding that I can jump straight into the game, learn the controlls, and instantly see how a good plan works, and a bad plan don't, and know EXACTLY why.One of the few problems i have with the game (which is completely subjective, and perhaps even a part of the intended difficulty) is that as the maps become bigger and the enemies more numeorus it becomes VERY tedious to make a working plan beforehand, and you basically have to ""test"" your way through the level. Another problem I have is that it gets problematic to controll bigger teams when you want them to walk the same path but perform different actions and cover different sectors, because their waypoints and routes overlap and create an unmanagable cluster. There should be a better way to toggle between the units and finalize/hide certain units' actions (maybe there is, but i missed it?).Another thing I wish was improved is the intelligence and behviour of the AI enemies. Considering they are hardened terrorists and seasoned criminals they're pretty stupid. This is really a realism issue, and not a gameplay issue, as I do mostly enjoy the game and it's dificulty as it is.			"

												So ill start this review of with a small story.So about a year go I was trying to choose between whether to buy Door Kickers or Breach and Clear during a sale, to me they both looked really interesting and fun to play so it wasnt an easy choice, but eventually I decided to buy Breach and Clear. I downloaded it, hit play and started to play, I really enjoyed the gameplay that it gave me but it was to short and didnt have much variety in the equipment I could give my soldiers, so I was still curious about Door Kickers and really wanted to play it, so about a year later I purchased Door Kickers. I started Playing Door Kickers and I immediately new this game was far superior to Breach and Clear, It contained much more content and variety in gameplay, as you have a much wider range in how you will will breach a building and what equipment you will use doing so. If you Have Breach and Clear and you enjoy it, Door kickers is 100% for you, or if you are trying to decide between Breach and Clear and Door Kickers, I would personally choose Door Kickers, I am not saying Breach and Clear is  a bad game i just think Door kickers is much better.One thing before I get into what is good and bad about the game I just want to mention something about the price-PRICE- I got Door Kickers for like 3$ or something and it is DEFINITELY worth that amount but the game is usually 20$, and I think this is pushing it a little to much as there are many other games out there for this amount that contain much more content, but if Top Down, Tactical games are your thing This is worth the 20$ -Now to what is Good and Bad about Door Kickers--PROS-- Lots of Variety (In how you breach Buildings and map types etc)- Provides hours of fun tactical gameplay- Many Primary and Secondary weapons to choose from- Nice graphics for a Top Down game- Easy to Run (You dont need Optimus Prime to be able to run it)- Easy to learn controls (also very smooth)- Can play custom maps from workshop - Can offer a real challenge on some maps - Plenty of missions-CONS- - Doesnt really have a storyline- When multiple troops paths cross or are close together it can be hard to tell a troop which way to look etc- A little expensive, but if you like topdown tactical games or its on sale its worth itOverall I think this game is one of the best games you will find in its genre, best suited for people that enjoy tactical gameplay, and the biggest downfall is its price even though its basically worth the price  "

												This game is a completely hidden gem. The content is massive and it's completely unassuming. I have been fooled by the top down 2D'ness of the game. Yet behind that facade of what might seem like a ""cheap"" game, are 3 campaigns, *80* (yes, EIGHTY) single missions with a variety of modes like 'Terrorist Hunt', 'Hostage Rescue', and a random mission generator to boot. Not only that, player made custom missions can be downloaded through the workshop.A variety of equipment are available, and it's extremely realistic. The added fact that all rifles are fired on single shot merrits mentioning, as firing assault rifles on full auto are only in movies or untrained armies. This game in my opinion, is far better than SWAT 4 or even the original Rainbow Six series were.			"

It's pretty awesome and at least a little bit addictive.If there's one criticism I'd have, it's that it could really use more varied voices. I'd actually be happy if they released a payable DLC that added south american drug cartel voices, arab terrorists, yakuza or triad mobsters, tchechen terrorists etc. If they could also add more voices for the swat team it would be fantastic.

												Really fun game to play!Looks?Reminds me of GTA 2  but with better graphics.Controls?Your mouse is almost exclusively sufficient. Keyboard use only for Go codes (A, B, C, D), sniper fire and some CTRL (locked view) and SHIFT key to highlight only selected paths. There are minor problems with complicated plans when lots of paths overlaps (even using SHIFFT) but TBH you can always be more precisie or just fix it when action goes live. Diversity of missions?More than enough. Bombs disarming, hostage rescue, VIP escorting, arresting bad guys, dope raids and simple enemy elimination.Guns and equipment?Quite a selection, especially gun wise but almost everything must be unlocked. Still when you find the fitting gun for all of your classes the selection will be just between classes (at least that was my case). Good guys?Well there are only three main stats for each officer and they are progressing without your choice but you can feel the difference between good and bad shooter especially with bad aiming gun. Bad guys?Enought to make it interesting but could be quite more. AI is quite good and on default missions there is several spawn points for bad guys, so it makes it more interesting.Maps?Plenty of different and really challenging ones.Is it tactical?Hell yeah it is ... but when you master most of the missions and use of pause you can kill everyone with one guy ... mostly. I had a lot of sneaky situations and they are planned to ambush you if you are not carefull. Some rage but no rage quits and that pleasant feeling when you finally do this.Replayibilty?With random missions and maps generator? Big. With steam workshop and plenty of maps, missions, guns, unit looks etc.? Quite bigger. Is it worth it?Hell yeah! I bought it for half the nominal price and I am more then satisfied of fun per eurocent ratio :-D			"

 Perfect for the Surface Pro 3 I found this through breach and clear on google play. I very nearly bought the mobile version until i realised it is available on steam. this is the only game that has ever made me feel guilty about a sale its perfect for both keyboard and tablet modes on my surface, So far I can only see one fault with it. in the first campain I failed a specific mission over and over again because my units could not fire fast enough so the hostage kept getting executed. however it has a level builder, mod support, 6 campaigns with more on the way and loads of loadout possibilitiesthis game is well worth the £15 I should have paid for it rather than the £2 from the sale			"

Also becomes very intense when playing campaign mode because when a operator dies he dies for good and you lose all of his xp.. He will be replaced on your roster but with a new level 0 operator.. This makes every life important and the strategies ever more important.. As a bad strategy could mean the death of an operator.. Or worse, Many operators..

												Great game.  Very addicting, mostly short levels.  Only complaint is that it can get repetative after you fully understand how to effectively clear rooms and unlock all the gear that you're ever going to use, but it takes quite a while to get to that point.			"

												I'm only a bit in to the game, but already loving this game a lot. The interface is not always great (it's easy to lose track of each person's path when they overlap, for example), but I really like the premise. It takes careful planning and good coordination to succeed, which it should in this type of game. But the game doesn't make you succeed through repetition. It is possible to clear every mission on the first try if you plan well.			"

												This game has a lot of annoying UI problems - most of which are minor, but they add up - but other than that it's pretty good.The game mechanics are solid, if a bit unrealistic in parts. For example, enemies can hit you with grenades when you're inside a house and they're outside, down the street. (The grenade appears to go over the exterior wall of a house and through the roof.) Cover isn't very consistent. Some cars give you cover; others don't. It has an iron-man mode, which I appreciate. The unit classes are a bit unbalanced in that some are much more useful than others, but it doesn't matter too much.The game has you executing civilians without warning and without giving them a chance to surrender, so you basically play a bad cop in a police state, but then we're all used to games being murder simulators anyway. The game calls the criminals ""terrorists"", which is about as accurate as calling them ""communists"". I'm slightly bothered by the promotion of terrorist hysteria and the dilution of the word ""terrorist"" into meaninglessness, but oh well.The map designs are pretty good, but it seems that you either need luck or prescience to beat some of them without casualties, which is a bit unfortunate. The game comes with an editor that lets you make your own scenarios and share them for other people to play.The game doesn't have a manual or a decent tutorial, but you can probably figure it out.The developer is very active in the forums and frequently responds to questions, which I greatly appreciate, but I'm not sure how good he is at fixing bugs. (I know of at least one problem that he said would be fixed ""in the next update"", but that was in August 2014 and it's still not fixed as of June 2015. Maybe he forgot or maybe he changed his mind. I don't know.)The existing campaigns and missions seem like they'll provide at least 20 hours of play, and there are supposed to be more campaigns coming. I don't know whether the developer will make good on that promise, but it's nice that the game is supposed to continue to grow in the future.Overall, the game has lots of little problems that detract from the enjoyment but even so it's still fun.

												Really a tremendously well-made strategy game around being a SWAT commando. There's a huge amount of content and there's already promises from the developer to add even more. I should add that the developer's openness and availability through things like Twitter make it a lot easier to love this game.It's a great game with solid mechanics. It's a terrific value, and the developers are very friendly/reasonable. Doorkickers is defintely worth getting if you have the slightest amount of interest.			"

												Play in short bursts or plan out your entire strategy, hit GO and watch your guys play it through. When you restart the mission after everyone gets killed, it keeps your previous mission plan so you can tweak it until you get the full 3 stars. I just started playing the game but it is exactly what I've been looking for. Plus something like 900 mods in the community AND a mission generator AND mission editor, this could be the last game you'll ever need to play.			"

												It's a great take on top down tactical close quarters combat.  It has the feel of the game ""Hotline Miami.""  The controls overall were why I stopped playing, they felt wonky and couldn't control the angle of your LOS (line of sight) very well, which rendered the tactical element of the game almost useless.  The concept is there, and it could be a lot of fun if you master the control scheme, however, I am just too old to try and get it down.  Fans of the Rainbow Six series (the old ones) will be familiar with this type of game, and likely enjoy it.  Also there is a Rainbow Six mod, which I played with that will add even more familiarity to this game.  I recommend it but with hestitation that he controls are very difficult to get in the groove.  Get this for sure if it is on sale, and you are a fan of tactical gameplay.			"

												WITHIN 2 HOURS: DOORKICKERSALL THE YESIt is a top-town tactical shooter where the goal is to complete CS like objectives against the clock and freindly bodycountThe gameplay when you manage to control the rather hectic command interface is really cool and rewarding as you are able to plan where your own custom SWAT team goes to looks and use items to interact with the maps, Say A guy flashbangs a large room and everyone piles in, You waste a bunch of terrorists but don't check your corners as well as you could have and a hidden good picks a guy off with an innacurate burst of SMG fire but he gets picked off and you complete the missionIt is all about how well you are able to use your team and their equipment at hand to deal with the threat on the map and it is glorousAnd the progression and replay value at a glance looks great too as there is a very wide variety of weapons avalible for each of all the 4 unique classes in the game, individual cops (alongside your own progress bar) are able to gain XP on the field leveling up and getting better as the game goes onOverall: ALL MY YES			"

												Team Alpha, go! Bravo, engage!Pros:- Doorkickers has a very great tactical element to it, allowing you to utilize unit sight lines to spy corners before entering and taking out the baddies before shots are fired. Using multiple units for cover and movement through doorways, flashing, flanking is very fun and very satisfying when it all goes according to the plan in your mind. - The different classes to combine on missions is very interesting and with mobility meters could spell the difference between a good outcome on a mission or a very fatal end.- Utilization of ""Go-Codes"" is always exciting when you are able to time your plan sequences in a smooth, fluid execution.- There is a SKILL tree and Doctrine points to purchase weapons and gear (only once) for all of your units to use- Lots of maps and creatable content to share with Steam friends and community. Cons:- I have to admit, sometimes the units can be a bit finnicky, and it gets a bit frustrating; there are two tangos in a large room on the other side of a locked door you cannot flashbang through - breaching with a hammer, lockpick, or breaching charge takes too much time to set up, you send a man through and direct his sight line to sweep, but instead of firing on the first guy he sees on side A, sweeps and shoots man in corner B instead and leaves the first man he sees in the shadows. Alongside the factor of friendly fire sight lines, its frustrating when you have 2 of your own units stacked on top of each other, but one will not fire in his designated direction due to a teammate being directly on top of him.- I've found that enemy units are able to fire simultaneously and hit my units while they are in a line, while my units cannot fire through each other. Something I think will be patched in the future.- Another issue I'm having is pathing selections: there are times where lines will overlap in a hallway and you wnat to change the sight line of ONE of your units, but you can't select his pathing line because the OTHER guys' line is on top of his. I tried to lock one unit's path with SHIFT, but doesn't seem to work. Something that can be fixed.Conclusion:All in all, I REALLY do enjoy the game. For $20? Sure. I honestly feel the game's INCLUDED content could have been more, the campaigns are a bit short, but the replayability with different tactics is refreshing. The focus on community map content is a bit harrowing, as I'm not one to really have time to download and configure all of it to work. I also feel that each class should have their own type of special ability in relation with the skill trees, instead of just access to a certain type of primary weapon. Different stat fluctuations, maybe? I don't know. It's still a great game to kill time and terrorists with.			"

												This is probably one of the most satisfying strategy games of all time.I just finished a mission with one single plan, without pausing, and got 3 stars. I felt like a badass, and I am now going to watch the replay and gloat.It took me a bit to get my head around the controls, but now they work great.I've only just started playing, so I'm on easier single missions, but there is just so much gameplay here between the included missions, campaigns, and various mods.In addition, I'm usually only coordinating 2 agents. There are a much more difficult missions with many more agents to plan and coordinate with, so there is some seriously deep tactical gameplay here.This looks very similar to Breach & Clear, so if you thought, like me, that it was a copy or something, you were wrong. While it has a free pause, so it can feel turn based, you can also go real time. It allows for a range of playstyles depending on your tastes. In addition, the lack of grid based movement ends up being a huge plus.Buy it.			"

												Ich habe das Spiel einige Zeit beobachtet. Das Grundkonzept hat mich von Anfang an angesprochen jedoch war ich sehr skeptisch was die Umsetzung anbelangt. Nach vielem hin und her habe ich im Sale zugeschlagen und muss sagen: Es lohnt sich. Natürlich nur für diejenigen die auf diese Art von spielen abfahren. Im Grunde ist es eine Huldigung an Spiele wie Rainbow Six oder SWAT. Trotzdem ist es eben was eigenes. Man könnte auch sagen man hat viel aus wenig gemacht und das Spiel ist der beste Beweis das es eben nicht immer tripple A Grafik sein muss um zu überzeugen. Die Spielmechanik ist einfach und intuitiv und schafft es mit wenig viel zu erreichen. Keine Komplexen Fingerverreckungen um einen Zugriff zu planen. Viel mehr ein rundes Interface das man schnell verinnerlicht. Die Soundkulisse ist gut wenn auch nicht perfekt. Wenn während eines Zugriffs ständig der gleiche Hintergrund-Loop abläuft können einem sogar US Sirenen mitunter auf den Keks gehen.Eine große Auswahl an Missionen in Verbindung mit einer ausreichenden Auswahl an Ausrüstung u. Waffen lassen einem genug freiraum und wem das nicht reicht der kann sich ja mit dem Editor befassen. Dazu kann ich allerdings noch gar nichts sagen da ich mich damit noch nicht befasst habe. Fazit: Ein feines Game für Fans des Genre, für alle anderen etwas das man im Sale ruhig mal ergattern kann jedoch beim Vollpreis wohl er nicht überzeugen wird. "

												Do I recommend this game? Yes. Absolutely. Here's why:-Intuitive leveling system; As you level up, you get points to spend on your trooper's skills, like better ""draw speed"" indoors, or the ability to make anyone using a silenced weapon hold their fire if they aren't in direct danger. Pretty rad.-A kind of currency: You earn stars for completing levels, the better you do, the more stars you earn, and you spend those stars on weapons and equipment for your troopers.-Can be played real-time, or with the ""Pause"" option, for those who want to take a tiny bit more time to think about their plan.-PERMADEATH: This is something that a lot of games don't do anymore. If you are in a Campaign (and only in campaigns), and a trooper dies in a mission, you lose that trooper (and his individual level and skills) forever, and he's replaced with a green trooper.-A pretty fun soundtrack-A small, but adequate variety of missions: Elimination, Hostage Rescue, VIP Escort, Bomb Defusal, House Calls, Drug Busts, and Arrest Warrants. (Some missions may have multiple properties of each kind of mission, like a bomb defusal mission might have hostages and evidence to gather (drugs)).Now here's why I WOULDN'T recommend it to some:-For those with short attention spans (this guy..) this game can get pretty dull at times.-Very frustrating level of difficulty later on. Enemies have strong body armor and spam grenades, which has the capacity to instantly kill your troopers or kill civilians, resulting in a more difficult (or instantly failed) mission.-High learning curve: Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT expect to play as well as the player in the videos, even if you're a strategy game guru. This game punishes hasty mistakes to the max, and early newcomers will have a hard time adapting to the controls and gameplay.There are plenty of other reasons for me to recommend this game or not to others, but these are my main ones, and the reason I love/hate this game at any given time.

Did you beat it within mission par time? Did you lose any men?Tons of scenarios to keep you busy (100+), and even a couple campaign modes of increasing difficulty.

												I absolutely f**king LOVE this game. If this game appeals to you in the slightest, then bloody buy it! One of my favourite PC exclusive games ever, I just cannot pull myself away. Although I want to as it is so f**king enjoyable but the campaign is ridiculously short so far. However, there is over 70 single missions which sort of make up for it. I just can't wait for there to be more campaign missions. The game mechanics can sometimes be a bit glitchy and frustrate me, which ends up in my favourite soldier getting slaughtered and thus having to restart the whole mission. But, other than the short campaign and confusing (at times) mechanics, I can't think of a single fault with this game.Just. F**king. Buy it!			"

Review  Door Kickers Detail/Deskripsi Gamepermainan strategi realtime yang begitu inovatif dan menempatkan Anda dimana anda harus bertanggung jawab atas tim SWAT anda dan memungkinkan Anda memberikan perintah mereka selama permainan.Menganalisa situasi, merencanakan rute perjalanan tiap anggota tim, memilih peralatan dan pelanggaran poin dan mengkoordinasikan beberapa polisi untuk mencapai ruang sandera sebelum orang-orang jahat bisa menekan pemicu itu.Ini mungkin terdengar menakutkan, dan seperti nyata CQB tempur dunia, memang. Tapi kebanyakan tingkat dapat diselesaikan dalam hitungan menit dan pada karya-karya fly improvisasi. Mencapai perencanaan yang sempurna, mendapatkan misi dilakukan dengan tidak ada langkah yang salah, itu keterampilan lebih sulit untuk menguasai.Kelebihan+ Mode Seperti Rainbow Six Vegas, tetapi tampilan 2D+ Setiap anggota tim, memiliki exp masing-masing+ punya job yang berbeda (assault, shotgun, silent dan shield)+ sound effect sangat baik+ graphic simple dan memuaskan+ benda sekitar bisa dijadikan tempat seperti meja dkk+ realtime shoot, yang dimana teman tim anda tidak bisa menembak musuh ketika berada di belakang tepat dibelakan tim yang lain+ Single Player dengan banyak map+ bisa custom map+ upgrade baik anggota tim maupun senjata+ steam workshop tentunya.Kekurangan- jika banyak anggota tim yang jalan di jalur yang sama, susah untuk memisahkannya apalagi memberikan tugas masing-masing ketika ada lebih dari 2 anggota tim yang berjalan di jalur yang sama- ganti mods = reset all game, exp hilang, semua anggota expnya hilang, seperti kembali ke awal game- custom mapnya shorcutnya kurang sehingga agak ribet mengedit.- pertama kali main, agak susah kendalikannya. karena video trailer seperti mudah, ternyata agak ribet.Apakah Game ini direkomendasikanyoi, game ini sangat rekomended deh, apalagi sekarang lagi diskon, gak beli rugi loh.. beli gih.. concept dari game ini sangat sederhana, simple. apalagi dengan sound effect membuatnya semakin real. gak hanya itu lagi, bisa steam workshop loh, itung-itung buat map sendiri khan bagus.

												First they were just a pair of door kicking beat cops with just handguns, rushing into buildings to take down a couple gangsta ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. A few missions with me and they became a heavily armed, door-exploding death squad taking on militias much larger than their own squad (Heinrich Himmler would have been proud). Just, uh, don't call them for a petty crime, I'm not sure they remember what it was like to be a cop.			"

												A lot of people compare Door Kickers to Breach & Clear, and even The Masterplan. Where this is probably a good comparison in terms of genre and what to expect, Door Kickers is far more fluid and boasts a rather active community giving the game experience a slight edge over Breach & Clear and perhaps a lasting experience.The concept is pretty simple. You run a SWAT-like squad which you are able to level up through single missions (""training"") and get to equip them with weapon and armour upgrades as you complete missions, level up your squad and gain ""roster stars"". These you spend on upgrades. You can also gain a type of skill point that you can use to improve the 3 basic weapon trees: hand-guns, assault, shot-guns. These all become bigger, brighter and better as you progress and start to unlock other roles for your squad: breacher, assaulter, stealth and a shielder. The workshop community have already created a large array of mission rooms and campaigns, but there is also an editor in-game and random room creator that help to gain those level ups before tackling the storyline campaigns. This isn't your Real World SWAT team. Don't expect negotiation abilities, or actual SWAT tactics to retrieve hostages. The game borrows from SWAT. Once you can accept that, then the game is pretty fun. You can stop/pause to plot within the mission or campaign, or run it fluidly which I think really adds to the atmosphere of the game. Fog of War obscures rooms and areas, so trying to clear out a biker gang hideout, or safely escort a VIP from a train station can be daunting, exciting and full of action if you don't pick the right squad members or plot your actions carefully. Leave no door unopened. Even if it is a toilet. Tangos hide in toilets.Overall, if you want something harking back to the old SWAT games, you may not like Door Kickers not keeping to SWAT regulations and realism. Otherwise, if you like using spy cameras to check out rooms for the bad guys, breaching with a shot gun, or using a shield guy as a decoy whilst you flank from behind some cars in a parking garage, you will probably really enjoy Door Kickers.

												Door Kickers is one of my favorite games. It requires you to think about every little move, and placement constantly. There is limitless content, the missions, the workshop missions, the generator, the editor, you just can't run out of levels.On top of just being a good top down strat game, it does really well at progression. There is many types of assault rifles, pistols, grenades, and equipment at your fingertips to complete a mission. You must use your Officers to get their skills up, and condition them to get better at aiming, and reaction time.Overall, I rate this game 9/10.I highly reccomended it.			"

												It's good. I mean, I spent 15 hours playing it. But...After losing my top officers again and again because I hit ""back"" instead of pressing ""restart"" after a failed mission, I just can't be bothered anymore. Not to mention that the semi-randomized location of your enemies makes it a lot less useful to plan your missions out ahead of time- a particular plan might work on one run but fail in the exact same spot the next, and you just have to keep restarting in the hopes that your enemies will be in the right rooms. It's frustrating because it's such a challenging and rewarding game otherwise, but there's a few little things that make you feel like you're being punished for nothing, and in such a high-stakes, difficult game, those things can really break the experience			"

								Easily one of the most intense top down games I've ever played. The ability to have multiple entry strategies whether that be placing a charge on the door, shooting the lock, or tossing in a flashbang makes the outcomes of just a single room almost immeasurable. The AI is great as well. If you take a more stealthy approach, the enemies may not be watching the door waiting for you. But if you charge through the house blasting everyone with shotguns, expect them to be in cover waiting for your squad to barge in. Also, even though on the menu it says its in the ""Alpha"" phase you could mistake this for a finished game. I've spent almost 4 hours in it I think and haven't seen a single bug or experienced an issue. The best 15 dollars I've ever spent. I hope its finished soon. If you can drop 15 dollars, put it into this game. You won't be dissappointed.			"

												Doorkickers feels a little bit like Rainbow Six 3, without the FPS part.You manage a squad of 2+ (depending on the mission) officers who have to clear a building, secure evidence or rescue hostages.Before starting the actual mission, you are to forge a plan of how to tackle the situation.You can give orders to each officer individually so that in the end they work together to clear the building as quickly and safely as possible.You may also give each officer different weapons, or a completely different class.Need a shielder? No problem.Or rather a breacher? You got it.A stealther? Sure.If you are not satisfied with certain aspects of the game, the modding community is doing their job for sure.From different/new weapons or armours, to completely new classes and obviously loads of user made maps.The cartoonish graphics are definitely no throw off. You will be way too focused on your tactics trying to keep your officers alive than to check out the beautiful flower pots in the bathroom.Just don't go thinking ""Easy peasy"". You will have your squad killed easier than one would think. A proper planning phase is half a victory.Now grab your gear and get on the truck. We are Oscar Mike in 5. Barricaded suspects holding a hostage which you need to rescue!			"

												Door Kickers is a top-down strategy game that puts you in a command of SWAT team. You have your SWAT team on disposal and you need to kick many doors (hence the name) and kill many bad guys.You can plan your assault and/or move your SWAT members in real time, also you can pause the time to make precise instructions for troops.The biggest plus of this game is modding. This game is not out too long but there are many mods: total conversion, skin mods, weapon mods, levels which can be published to workshop from in-game so this adds to great, infinite replayability.So yeah, I recommend this gameTIP: don't give names to your squad members of your family and friends because they will get brutally murdered by a terrorist that you missed in that one corner where you didn't expect him "

								Super little game. Fun enough at the moment that even if development stopped for some reason I'd not feel I'd wasted any money and they're adding plenty of other features/content as development goes on anyway.If you played the old Rainbow 6 then it has similarities to the planning phase of that but can play/pause as you go (and control the officers while they're running your plan for desperate tweaks etc); I'd be tempted to compare the positioning etc to Frozen Synapse too.  The idea is to achieve the goal of the level; at the moment one of, kill everyone, rescue the hostage/s, make the arrest or disarm the bomb.  There are other goals to get better ratings on each level which are to beat a certain time and to keep as many of your chaps up as possible.Advancement is both by individual cops gaining in ability and rank, and ""Squad Doctrine"" group training options.Gear is selectable both by a class (which can be changed per mission) and choices within that class- which specific guns, armour and gadgets your chap will carry into the mission.  Some of the choices at the moment are fairly irrelevant and down to small preferences, others will have a big effect on how you go through the mission.POST RELEASE additional comments:There are a selection of single missions; randomly generated single missions; mods from the workshop and campaigns.  The single missions are sort of training for the campaigns really, both yourself, and leveling your troops/unlocking gear.  The campaigns themselves are perma-death but with restarts though there is iron-man mode which doesn't allow restarting. All in all a pretty vast amount of prepared content and then there are all the mods and randomly generated content making for a pretty near infinite game...and you'll almost certainly want to do individual bits multiple times too.I've gone through the single missions multiple times now and there's still tactical improvements, nuances etc to learn.  They've updated adding more content and more is still to come.  If you like tactical stuff just do yourself a favour and buy this game.			"

												This is a great game that I would really suggest buying if you are into these types of games. Takes a little to get the hang of it but I love all the different classes and customization in the game. You really can get into the game and can be very challenging in the later levels. CONS: The only thing that I'm not a big fan of is that it does get repetitive a little and there is no story line to the campaign.			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. The 4 hours I've spent on this game have been some of the best hours I've ever spent on a game. As most people said (in which I agree) this game is a Top-Down SWAT 4, and I have absolutely no problem with that, since I play SWAT 4 often because it's on my computer, and it's awesome, and I have just as much (maybe even more) fun on this. My 2 only problems with this game are: The ""random"" map generator, isn't really random, but that doesn't bother me as much as this, THERE IS NO SHIELD OR STEALTH DOCTRINE. Now I realize there is a mod for a stealth doctrine, but I'm not too fond of it, so hopefully the developers can add these 2, my ideas for a stealth doctrine is hopefully it makes the stealth guys completely silent at footsteps, lockpicking, basically everything, and I hope in the shield doctine they add a shield bash ability, that'd be totally awesome. This is a great game overall and I absolutely love it and will play it all the time probably, good job developers, hopefully you'll see this and take my ideas into consideration, love this game though, keep up the good work!

												I had this on my Wishlist for a long time but couldn't really see that it justified the 19€ Price Tag. It came up in the steam sale for 8€ and I was bored.OMFGGGGGG I wish I had just said meh and bought it full price back then, because the last few weeks could have already been spent running through the same map for the umpteenth time to PERFECT my run. And I really do not mean this negatively, this game MAKES me want to do that map just a tick better. If I threw the Flashbang at this point instead of this one, If I took assault rifles instead of pistols. If i didn't accidently shoot the hostage 4 times in the head :DIt is a game of the old school. Simple graphics, good learning curve, extremely easy to start playing extremely hard to master: impossible to put down.. Can't wait to see where this goes.			"

												I got Door Kickers as part of a Humble Bundle so I was pleasantly surprised when I got an awesome game that I didn't really intend to buy!This game is awesome. Great mix of paused and real-time gameplay. Can't really say anything good about this other than what you've already seen in other reviews.The downsides I've come across may be unique to my experience though, and are worth pointing out:1) The controls took quite awhile to get the hang of. I didn't feel like I had a clue for the first 3 hours or so of gameplay. This was off-putting at first. I almost stopped playing but was glad I decided to take a break and come back the next day and try again. It also helped a lot to turn on colored paths in the options menu. Not sure why that's not a default.2) Somehow I totally missed the ""Doctrines"". I'm not sure if this was ever explained early on in the game, but I was about 30 missions in before I realized that existed. I got to a certain mission that I had a really hard time beating, then was about to take a break. I went back to the main menu to quit and finally saw ""Doctrines: 9"". I spent those and then immediately destroyed the mission. They make a big difference! Missing it may have been totally my fault, but if it's not made obvious that they exist, it would be an improvement if they highlighted those at some point.			"

												Almost immediately after I’m spotted, the bad guys kill the hostage. I take a brief moment to unleash a string of curses and rack my brain. There must be another route I can take, another plan that would give this scenario a happy ending. I tinker with the map and reset, and soon I hear a meaty splat as the hostage gets killed again.Door Kickers is a game about cops kicking down doors, and these doors are a lot of fun to kick down. It is also very hard, and I love it for that. Played from a top-down, pausable view, this is the game that happens when Rainbow Six’s planning stage grows up and finds a home on a modern engine. It is also one of the most finely detailed, cleverly executed puzzle games I’ve played in years.Fog of warEach mission in Door Kickers starts with a deployment phase. Within this phase, I see the target house as a set of blueprints, atop which I can change shooters’ equipment and starting positions. As missions become more complex, the deployment phase becomes where I make some of my most important decisions. Door Kickers is a great tactical game because it is a great question generator:Are there narrow hallways? Will all firefights be up close? Are there hostages? Do I have sharpshooter support? Is there furniture? Is there evidence to save? Do the bad guys have bigger guns than me? Every piece of information changes the ideal approach and forces adaptation.After the deployment screen, the mission begins with time paused. From the paused overview, I drag paths for officers to follow, change the direction they’re covering, and order them to breach a door. This simple array of options becomes a complicated choreography of death pretty fast. In later missions, my eight officers follow a dance routine with hundreds of steps, pauses, shooting angles, and go-codes. Giving these orders is straightforward and malleable, but the interface is missing some important functions. If I give two units overlapping paths (walking single-file next to a wall, for example), I don’t have any way of selecting one trail over another when I want to edit it. To work around this, I have my units walk behind and to the side of each other, but that’s frequently a poor decision, tactics-wise. With eight officers in a narrow hallways, it also gets downright silly.Some of the other limitations of this system are simply built into the game engine: there’s no crouching or leaning, so the game’s combat takes place entirely on a two-dimensional plane with straight lines. It rarely feels as flat as it is, but there are occasions where I would love to stack a crouched unit under a standing unit, and these are the times when the game’s simulation feels most like a puzzle game and least like a camera looking down on a real-life SWAT situation.

								The mechanics in this game are just top notch, they are easy to grasp, can be combined easily, offer a very deep tactical experience, but above all else, they are fun. I had to play the same mission about 20 times before I made it through without losing a man, and I had fun the whole time. Any game where you can fail over and over again and still be having fun is a damn good game in my book.			"

								Super little game. Fun enough at the moment that even if development stopped for some reason I'd not feel I'd wasted any money and they're adding plenty of other features/content as development goes on anyway.If you played the old Rainbow 6 then it has similarities to the planning phase of that but can play/pause as you go (and control the officers while they're running your plan for desperate tweaks etc); I'd be tempted to compare the positioning etc to Frozen Synapse too.  The idea is to achieve the goal of the level; at the moment one of, kill everyone, rescue the hostage/s, make the arrest or disarm the bomb.  There are other goals to get better ratings on each level which are to beat a certain time and to keep as many of your chaps up as possible.Advancement is both by individual cops gaining in ability and rank, and ""Squad Doctrine"" group training options.Gear is selectable both by a class (which can be changed per mission) and choices within that class- which specific guns, armour and gadgets your chap will carry into the mission.  Some of the choices at the moment are fairly irrelevant and down to small preferences, others will have a big effect on how you go through the mission.POST RELEASE additional comments:There are a selection of single missions; randomly generated single missions; mods from the workshop and campaigns.  The single missions are sort of training for the campaigns really, both yourself, and leveling your troops/unlocking gear.  The campaigns themselves are perma-death but with restarts though there is iron-man mode which doesn't allow restarting. All in all a pretty vast amount of prepared content and then there are all the mods and randomly generated content making for a pretty near infinite game...and you'll almost certainly want to do individual bits multiple times too.I've gone through the single missions multiple times now and there's still tactical improvements, nuances etc to learn.  They've updated adding more content and more is still to come.  If you like tactical stuff just do yourself a favour and buy this game.			"

								This game is brilliant. For a game still in development, it is surprisingly good. One of my favourite top-down games ever. Easy enough to understand, but with a great deal of versatility in regards to how you wish to play out each mission. Do you go slowly from room to room, checking past each door with a spy camera, or just charge in with shotguns, grenades and breaching charges? This game can also be quite challenging, which means completion of a difficult mission actually feels like an achievment. I'm hoping as development goes forward the variety of weapons, tools, tactics and missions  will all increase, so you can play the game entirely your way.			"

												Doorkickers is a awesome game!  You have to plan and execute Missions for a Police Squad. You can plan the whole execution before you start the mission or change the plan while the Mission is running. You have many options how you get the job done. You get single Mission: They are like squad training missions. You can use them to learn and improve your Squad. Unlock new weapons and skills. You have multiple Campaigns: Here you have to be careful it is possible that your squad members die during the campaign.There is also new contet, which is added to the game constantly from the developers. In Addtion, you have content from players on the Steam workshop. Overall, you can have a lot of fun with that game. I bought it on the Steam Christmas sale but form me is worth it´s 19, - € "

												This game is a completely hidden gem. The content is massive and it's completely unassuming. I have been fooled by the top down 2D'ness of the game. Yet behind that facade of what might seem like a ""cheap"" game, are 3 campaigns, *80* (yes, EIGHTY) single missions with a variety of modes like 'Terrorist Hunt', 'Hostage Rescue', and a random mission generator to boot. Not only that, player made custom missions can be downloaded through the workshop.A variety of equipment are available, and it's extremely realistic. The added fact that all rifles are fired on single shot merrits mentioning, as firing assault rifles on full auto are only in movies or untrained armies. This game in my opinion, is far better than SWAT 4 or even the original Rainbow Six series were.			"

If you're into puzzle games, where you can pause the action to try and compose yourself, and think about your next move, than this is for you. I belive this is my favorite part. I'll use my units to clear each room, one at a time, pausing to figure out the next steps. Does it always go to plan? Hell no, but i have a LOT of fun failing. I've had my eye on this game for a few months, and I really wish I picked it up sooner.			"

								Door Kickers is a top-down stradegy game where you control SWAT members, each with his own stats.BETA VERSION: Some stuff here is subject to change, so when you play it may be different! These are my opinions about it all!Pros:+Members have different stats that increase as they gain experience through missions.+Style and elements are very good and work with the game exceptionally well.+Take down hostiles however you want, stealth or guns blazing (which is difficult)+Weapons and Armor are unlockable as you beat levels!+Badge can be customized off real ones, like NYPD+Random Mission Generator is fun to mess with adn what you will use the most, probably+Very Neat Replay system, enjoyable to watch yourself decimate your enemies in slow motion+STEAM WORKSHOP is amazing with thisNeither:-+The exeperience system takes a long time to get the breacher and Stealth class and requires more play time to unlock.-+Workshop is (Version 0.1.1) currently broken and hardly any good mods work :(-+Bugs, but it is in BETA so can't complainCons:-The pathing system has a hard time getting past obstacles like benchs, etc.-Armor is a pain to unlock, besides the Extended Armor which is 5 stars.-Random Mission Generator stars dont actually give you Roster stars, but still give XP.-Some enemies can see troops while the troops can't see them WHEN they are right in front of him. ie around a corner or in a room he is facing.-No trooper will ever die if you use the restart button. Guy dies, restart mission and you have him back.Overall, Fun for the stradegy people out there and a very fine and playable game right now. 8/10			"

												Doorkickers in an awesome semi-realistic top-down pause/play Urban Ops tactical planning game (a lot of words, i know), focusing on police and counter-terrorism scenarios. It has exceptional value for your money, and the devs are decent enough to actually bring a good game out of early acces. That shouldn't have to be a plus, but it is.Your SWAT team is fully levlable with it's own skill tree, seperate from the leveling of each individual team member, and the unlocking of new gear for your team, which adds to the feeling of progression and depth of the game. There are a LOT of ways to complete most levels, and as you unlock new gear you can go back and solve a scenario in a new and better way, improving replayability. Your team members die permanently (and is replaced by a rookie police officer) if you don't restart a mission where someone died, which gives every tactical decission you make a distinct feeling of importance. For someone with basic experience with military urban ops tactics, gameplay feels intuitive and realistic in that real life techniques and equipment are successfull when applied apropriately within the game. It's rewarding that I can jump straight into the game, learn the controlls, and instantly see how a good plan works, and a bad plan don't, and know EXACTLY why.One of the few problems i have with the game (which is completely subjective, and perhaps even a part of the intended difficulty) is that as the maps become bigger and the enemies more numeorus it becomes VERY tedious to make a working plan beforehand, and you basically have to ""test"" your way through the level. Another problem I have is that it gets problematic to controll bigger teams when you want them to walk the same path but perform different actions and cover different sectors, because their waypoints and routes overlap and create an unmanagable cluster. There should be a better way to toggle between the units and finalize/hide certain units' actions (maybe there is, but i missed it?).Another thing I wish was improved is the intelligence and behviour of the AI enemies. Considering they are hardened terrorists and seasoned criminals they're pretty stupid. This is really a realism issue, and not a gameplay issue, as I do mostly enjoy the game and it's dificulty as it is.			"

												So ill start this review of with a small story.So about a year go I was trying to choose between whether to buy Door Kickers or Breach and Clear during a sale, to me they both looked really interesting and fun to play so it wasnt an easy choice, but eventually I decided to buy Breach and Clear. I downloaded it, hit play and started to play, I really enjoyed the gameplay that it gave me but it was to short and didnt have much variety in the equipment I could give my soldiers, so I was still curious about Door Kickers and really wanted to play it, so about a year later I purchased Door Kickers. I started Playing Door Kickers and I immediately new this game was far superior to Breach and Clear, It contained much more content and variety in gameplay, as you have a much wider range in how you will will breach a building and what equipment you will use doing so. If you Have Breach and Clear and you enjoy it, Door kickers is 100% for you, or if you are trying to decide between Breach and Clear and Door Kickers, I would personally choose Door Kickers, I am not saying Breach and Clear is  a bad game i just think Door kickers is much better.One thing before I get into what is good and bad about the game I just want to mention something about the price-PRICE- I got Door Kickers for like 3$ or something and it is DEFINITELY worth that amount but the game is usually 20$, and I think this is pushing it a little to much as there are many other games out there for this amount that contain much more content, but if Top Down, Tactical games are your thing This is worth the 20$ -Now to what is Good and Bad about Door Kickers--PROS-- Lots of Variety (In how you breach Buildings and map types etc)- Provides hours of fun tactical gameplay- Many Primary and Secondary weapons to choose from- Nice graphics for a Top Down game- Easy to Run (You dont need Optimus Prime to be able to run it)- Easy to learn controls (also very smooth)- Can play custom maps from workshop - Can offer a real challenge on some maps - Plenty of missions-CONS- - Doesnt really have a storyline- When multiple troops paths cross or are close together it can be hard to tell a troop which way to look etc- A little expensive, but if you like topdown tactical games or its on sale its worth itOverall I think this game is one of the best games you will find in its genre, best suited for people that enjoy tactical gameplay, and the biggest downfall is its price even though its basically worth the price  "

												Really fun game to play!Looks?Reminds me of GTA 2  but with better graphics.Controls?Your mouse is almost exclusively sufficient. Keyboard use only for Go codes (A, B, C, D), sniper fire and some CTRL (locked view) and SHIFT key to highlight only selected paths. There are minor problems with complicated plans when lots of paths overlaps (even using SHIFFT) but TBH you can always be more precisie or just fix it when action goes live. Diversity of missions?More than enough. Bombs disarming, hostage rescue, VIP escorting, arresting bad guys, dope raids and simple enemy elimination.Guns and equipment?Quite a selection, especially gun wise but almost everything must be unlocked. Still when you find the fitting gun for all of your classes the selection will be just between classes (at least that was my case). Good guys?Well there are only three main stats for each officer and they are progressing without your choice but you can feel the difference between good and bad shooter especially with bad aiming gun. Bad guys?Enought to make it interesting but could be quite more. AI is quite good and on default missions there is several spawn points for bad guys, so it makes it more interesting.Maps?Plenty of different and really challenging ones.Is it tactical?Hell yeah it is ... but when you master most of the missions and use of pause you can kill everyone with one guy ... mostly. I had a lot of sneaky situations and they are planned to ambush you if you are not carefull. Some rage but no rage quits and that pleasant feeling when you finally do this.Replayibilty?With random missions and maps generator? Big. With steam workshop and plenty of maps, missions, guns, unit looks etc.? Quite bigger. Is it worth it?Hell yeah! I bought it for half the nominal price and I am more then satisfied of fun per eurocent ratio :-D			"

												Probably the closest we'll ever get to another SWAT game. You get a selection of weapons and equipment to complete missions, from stun guns to stinger grenades to M4s. Then you're asked to complete levels in times that would make the SAS sweat. Tasks can range from rescuing hostages to defusing bombs, to simply killng all enemies in the level. Intricate planning is a must - one mistake and that trooper you've been so proud of will be eating dirt in a second. You're not tougher than the enemies, so be smarter. It's a tough, rewarding, fun strategy game with oodles of content (single levels, campaigns, and a mission generator). Well worth full price, and on sale, it's a steal.			"

												It's awesome to see that a game really takes the tactics to a new level. Think of it like a more tactical version of X-com without the strategic elements.I would really recommend this to anyone that likes a challenging, tactical, experience.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is brilliant. For a game still in development, it is surprisingly good. One of my favourite top-down games ever. Easy enough to understand, but with a great deal of versatility in regards to how you wish to play out each mission. Do you go slowly from room to room, checking past each door with a spy camera, or just charge in with shotguns, grenades and breaching charges? This game can also be quite challenging, which means completion of a difficult mission actually feels like an achievment. I'm hoping as development goes forward the variety of weapons, tools, tactics and missions  will all increase, so you can play the game entirely your way.			"

												As a tactical command game, Door kickers is amazingly satisfying.The missions are fair, and are never forced to be unreasonably hard, with a bit of thought all missions can be completed without casualties.What really makes this game shine is the modability.You can spend hours playing around with the features of this, and the Devs have done a good job to make it accesable.Highly recommend this to any breachers in waiting.

												I've got a little more than an hour into this game, and I have to say, it is thrilling. It reminds me a lot of the old SWAT2 title, but far more approchable. If you're into puzzle games, where you can pause the action to try and compose yourself, and think about your next move, than this is for you. I belive this is my favorite part. I'll use my units to clear each room, one at a time, pausing to figure out the next steps. Does it always go to plan? Hell no, but i have a LOT of fun failing. I've had my eye on this game for a few months, and I really wish I picked it up sooner.			"

								Door Kickers is a top-down stradegy game where you control SWAT members, each with his own stats.BETA VERSION: Some stuff here is subject to change, so when you play it may be different! These are my opinions about it all!Pros:+Members have different stats that increase as they gain experience through missions.+Style and elements are very good and work with the game exceptionally well.+Take down hostiles however you want, stealth or guns blazing (which is difficult)+Weapons and Armor are unlockable as you beat levels!+Badge can be customized off real ones, like NYPD+Random Mission Generator is fun to mess with adn what you will use the most, probably+Very Neat Replay system, enjoyable to watch yourself decimate your enemies in slow motion+STEAM WORKSHOP is amazing with thisNeither:-+The exeperience system takes a long time to get the breacher and Stealth class and requires more play time to unlock.-+Workshop is (Version 0.1.1) currently broken and hardly any good mods work :(-+Bugs, but it is in BETA so can't complainCons:-The pathing system has a hard time getting past obstacles like benchs, etc.-Armor is a pain to unlock, besides the Extended Armor which is 5 stars.-Random Mission Generator stars dont actually give you Roster stars, but still give XP.-Some enemies can see troops while the troops can't see them WHEN they are right in front of him. ie around a corner or in a room he is facing.-No trooper will ever die if you use the restart button. Guy dies, restart mission and you have him back.Overall, Fun for the stradegy people out there and a very fine and playable game right now. 8/10			"

												Doorkickers in an awesome semi-realistic top-down pause/play Urban Ops tactical planning game (a lot of words, i know), focusing on police and counter-terrorism scenarios. It has exceptional value for your money, and the devs are decent enough to actually bring a good game out of early acces. That shouldn't have to be a plus, but it is.Your SWAT team is fully levlable with it's own skill tree, seperate from the leveling of each individual team member, and the unlocking of new gear for your team, which adds to the feeling of progression and depth of the game. There are a LOT of ways to complete most levels, and as you unlock new gear you can go back and solve a scenario in a new and better way, improving replayability. Your team members die permanently (and is replaced by a rookie police officer) if you don't restart a mission where someone died, which gives every tactical decission you make a distinct feeling of importance. For someone with basic experience with military urban ops tactics, gameplay feels intuitive and realistic in that real life techniques and equipment are successfull when applied apropriately within the game. It's rewarding that I can jump straight into the game, learn the controlls, and instantly see how a good plan works, and a bad plan don't, and know EXACTLY why.One of the few problems i have with the game (which is completely subjective, and perhaps even a part of the intended difficulty) is that as the maps become bigger and the enemies more numeorus it becomes VERY tedious to make a working plan beforehand, and you basically have to ""test"" your way through the level. Another problem I have is that it gets problematic to controll bigger teams when you want them to walk the same path but perform different actions and cover different sectors, because their waypoints and routes overlap and create an unmanagable cluster. There should be a better way to toggle between the units and finalize/hide certain units' actions (maybe there is, but i missed it?).Another thing I wish was improved is the intelligence and behviour of the AI enemies. Considering they are hardened terrorists and seasoned criminals they're pretty stupid. This is really a realism issue, and not a gameplay issue, as I do mostly enjoy the game and it's dificulty as it is.			"

												Doorkickers is a awesome game!  You have to plan and execute Missions for a Police Squad. You can plan the whole execution before you start the mission or change the plan while the Mission is running. You have many options how you get the job done. You get single Mission: They are like squad training missions. You can use them to learn and improve your Squad. Unlock new weapons and skills. You have multiple Campaigns: Here you have to be careful it is possible that your squad members die during the campaign.There is also new contet, which is added to the game constantly from the developers. In Addtion, you have content from players on the Steam workshop. Overall, you can have a lot of fun with that game. I bought it on the Steam Christmas sale but form me is worth it´s 19, - € "

												This game is a completely hidden gem. The content is massive and it's completely unassuming. I have been fooled by the top down 2D'ness of the game. Yet behind that facade of what might seem like a ""cheap"" game, are 3 campaigns, *80* (yes, EIGHTY) single missions with a variety of modes like 'Terrorist Hunt', 'Hostage Rescue', and a random mission generator to boot. Not only that, player made custom missions can be downloaded through the workshop.A variety of equipment are available, and it's extremely realistic. The added fact that all rifles are fired on single shot merrits mentioning, as firing assault rifles on full auto are only in movies or untrained armies. This game in my opinion, is far better than SWAT 4 or even the original Rainbow Six series were.			"

												So ill start this review of with a small story.So about a year go I was trying to choose between whether to buy Door Kickers or Breach and Clear during a sale, to me they both looked really interesting and fun to play so it wasnt an easy choice, but eventually I decided to buy Breach and Clear. I downloaded it, hit play and started to play, I really enjoyed the gameplay that it gave me but it was to short and didnt have much variety in the equipment I could give my soldiers, so I was still curious about Door Kickers and really wanted to play it, so about a year later I purchased Door Kickers. I started Playing Door Kickers and I immediately new this game was far superior to Breach and Clear, It contained much more content and variety in gameplay, as you have a much wider range in how you will will breach a building and what equipment you will use doing so. If you Have Breach and Clear and you enjoy it, Door kickers is 100% for you, or if you are trying to decide between Breach and Clear and Door Kickers, I would personally choose Door Kickers, I am not saying Breach and Clear is  a bad game i just think Door kickers is much better.One thing before I get into what is good and bad about the game I just want to mention something about the price-PRICE- I got Door Kickers for like 3$ or something and it is DEFINITELY worth that amount but the game is usually 20$, and I think this is pushing it a little to much as there are many other games out there for this amount that contain much more content, but if Top Down, Tactical games are your thing This is worth the 20$ -Now to what is Good and Bad about Door Kickers--PROS-- Lots of Variety (In how you breach Buildings and map types etc)- Provides hours of fun tactical gameplay- Many Primary and Secondary weapons to choose from- Nice graphics for a Top Down game- Easy to Run (You dont need Optimus Prime to be able to run it)- Easy to learn controls (also very smooth)- Can play custom maps from workshop - Can offer a real challenge on some maps - Plenty of missions-CONS- - Doesnt really have a storyline- When multiple troops paths cross or are close together it can be hard to tell a troop which way to look etc- A little expensive, but if you like topdown tactical games or its on sale its worth itOverall I think this game is one of the best games you will find in its genre, best suited for people that enjoy tactical gameplay, and the biggest downfall is its price even though its basically worth the price  "

												Really fun game to play!Looks?Reminds me of GTA 2  but with better graphics.Controls?Your mouse is almost exclusively sufficient. Keyboard use only for Go codes (A, B, C, D), sniper fire and some CTRL (locked view) and SHIFT key to highlight only selected paths. There are minor problems with complicated plans when lots of paths overlaps (even using SHIFFT) but TBH you can always be more precisie or just fix it when action goes live. Diversity of missions?More than enough. Bombs disarming, hostage rescue, VIP escorting, arresting bad guys, dope raids and simple enemy elimination.Guns and equipment?Quite a selection, especially gun wise but almost everything must be unlocked. Still when you find the fitting gun for all of your classes the selection will be just between classes (at least that was my case). Good guys?Well there are only three main stats for each officer and they are progressing without your choice but you can feel the difference between good and bad shooter especially with bad aiming gun. Bad guys?Enought to make it interesting but could be quite more. AI is quite good and on default missions there is several spawn points for bad guys, so it makes it more interesting.Maps?Plenty of different and really challenging ones.Is it tactical?Hell yeah it is ... but when you master most of the missions and use of pause you can kill everyone with one guy ... mostly. I had a lot of sneaky situations and they are planned to ambush you if you are not carefull. Some rage but no rage quits and that pleasant feeling when you finally do this.Replayibilty?With random missions and maps generator? Big. With steam workshop and plenty of maps, missions, guns, unit looks etc.? Quite bigger. Is it worth it?Hell yeah! I bought it for half the nominal price and I am more then satisfied of fun per eurocent ratio :-D			"

												Edit: Apparantly there is an android version - it just isn't available for MY android units, unfortunately. Rating: 8/10Replayability: HighBudget: Too expensive - Once it drops to about 5 Eur, I recommend getting it. Lenght: Endless. This entertaining little title isn't a full game with a story and such. It's an entertaining small game with good functions and a cheap setup, that works really well as a minor entertainment module on a tablet - It's a wonder it's not out for android yet! This could even feasibly be played on a phone. It's a really fun game, especially for people who enjoy games like Rainbow Six, SWAT, Xcom or the old Commandos series. I'd say the game has less depth than the goldie-oldies like Commandos, and it appears to have no multiplayer function, which could have been interesting - You know, sort of co-op, each player controls half the available team and can see each other's plans. Watch a let's play of this title before you get it! I wouldn't say this is a game you're going to binge-play, nor is it a game you will play occupationally, but it's good to have on a windows tablet or light-end laptop for train rides, plane rides, killing time in lunchbreaks or what not. If you have an Ipad (I don't), the game will serve you much better - I hope it comes out for android too, as it would become much more usable for people in general. It's sort of the same ""type"" (not to confuse with genre) as FTL, the sort of game that has a lot of entertainment value without really having any real depht. I find that I enjoy these minimalistic games a lot.			"

												The store page description said it clear: Real Time with Free Pause No turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfaces Realistic but action packed Those points made me buy the game, and I was never disappointed. Door Kickers is best SWAT type tactical strategy you will ever play. The game offers many customization for your squad, many type of weapons and tools to choose from. There are tons of missions and campaigns, with ability to build your own mission and share it on steamwrokshop. The main things that made me really enjoy this game is the planning, the more you plan and make sure you use the right tools in right position the more of chance you will pass the mission, the beautiful thing that once you hit the unpause button you will see how your orchestrated plan going, and if it works as you plan and succeed, you will feel the satisfaction in such way that you will never feel it in any other similar game. The game use simple 2D graphics, but with many details to reload and recoil of each weapon.I totally recommend this game for any tactical games fans, it is great value of money. "

												very easy to learn as the controls are quite simple, but quite an in depth game thats highly addictive.one thing i really love about this game is that it takes about 3 seconds to load to the main menu, after which everything instantly loads the second you click it. that means i can load up and be straight into it within a very quick amount of time.drawing a path for your team to follow is quite fluid, if your wobbly on the mouse your teams path will be too.insert commands easily onto that path, so they will CLEAR !  a room before moving on, strafe a certain direction, or wait for a go code.use the single missions to level up your team, unlock better weapons, shields, armor, tools etc by earning stars. once something is unlocked its free to assign to any other team member.once your team is good enough you can start doing campaigns.theres virtually hundreds of maps to choose from, and a steam workshop to add even more gear and maps.unlock new squad types like assaulter, breacher, shield and improve them by earning doctrine points to spend on perks for each class.weapon type and loadout will have a big effect on how your team maneuvers, its fire rate, accuracy, stopping power or clip size.assaulting an airplane to save some hostages? maybe the pistols will allow you to maneuver around easier and change targets quicker to fire off a few well placed rounds rather than trying to use a clumsy shotgun or spray machine gun fire about.use a camera under the door to spot targets, blow open the door, flashbang, give the go signal with a ""go code"" to assault rooms full of terrorists from different doorways, save the hostages, disarm bombs, and taze the guy you have a warrant for.i give it 80/100 dead terrorists			"

												It's awesome. ""Overwhelmingly positive"" not only says it all but is dead-on.It feels not new but completely novel at the same time. I thought it'd finally be a game where you can just click play and enjoy it in between busy times (which you can) but so far it's only addictive and I can't stop playing.Planing out your raids, trying to get every little detail right, every little corner of the room covered is just heaps of fun. And I'm not even at the level yet where I would try to get the challenges done or challenge myself. It feels like one of those games where you keep thinking ""yes, finally someone realized that graphics isn't all and gameplay is the important part of a game"". If there are any glitches or graphics aren't good (it feels like they are just amazing enough for this game) than I haven't realized any of that because I'm completely sucked into the window in the middle of the screen where all the action is happening.

												In my years of gaming, I have seen many great products come and go. Great products like Rainbow Six and SWAT as they made their mark in the gaming world. You tend to look back on those games and ask yourself this question. Does anyone still remember those days? How they helped pave the way for tactical strategy in games?When Door Kickers came along, the answer couldn't have been more clear. ""♥♥♥♥ yeah we remember!"" What's good about the game:-The deep tactical planning, choose from a wide variety of weapons and equipment to plan your approach. (You can even change their names if you're into that sort of thing.) Use your troopers to their maxium potiental to get the job done and bring everyone home safe. Espically in Iron Man mode you will have to take your planning very seriously as every  trooper death only makes your job harder.  -Open-ended planning, missions can be completed in several different ways. It will be up to you to determine what is the best course of action. -Random enemy placement. In most if not all cases, the odds will be stacked against you. You will face off against several tangos (bad guys) armed to the teeth and not knowing for sure of how many  are there or their location adds tenson to the action. Just because you have a plan figured out, doesn't mean things can't go wrong. -The ability to do two different playstyles. The first being a pause, plan, action playstyle. Before your troopers get into the thick of it, you can pause the game and develop a course of action for them. Tell who to go where, where to look, where to strafe, etc. Then watch it unfold when you switch it to real time. The second being what I call wing-it mode. You can play the entire mission in real time and make things up as you go. So players that aren't into the whole stop and think style aren't forced to play that way. -Numerous amount of missions and counting. There are several missions to be completed in this game, all of which have a lot of replayablity to them. Single missions, campagns, custom player-made missions, randomly generated missions. It feels practically endless to what can be done to have missions.  Furthermore, as of the time of this review, the developers are still adding missions, content, and improvements to the game.-Mod support. Something about the game you want to change up? Things like new weapons, gear,etc? Odds are there is a mod that fits the bill and there are quite a few to choose from. -The bits of comedic relief. Though this game has an overall serious tone, there are bits of humor thrown in that is quite amusing to lighten the mood a little when needed. It's not obnoxious or intrusive ethier, it's well timed and unexpected.  I'm not to going to spoil them as I'll leave them to be discovered yourself. ;)I honestly can't think of anything serious to complain about with Door Kickers. It's an overall well made and addicting tactical strategy game that is worthy of your money and time.  Even at full price, you get a lot for twenty dollars.  "

*** I bought this game during the 2014 year-end Steam sale, and played when I got back to my uni before the finals week, most of the time off-line (>80% of my playtime) due to a massive flood disaster. So at the time this is written, I have played almost 100 hours offline, and only 13 hours with Steam online, which is why Steam only clocks me as have played only 13 hours.Oh and one more thing: I like writing, so my review is going to be REALLY long.Now with that out of the way, I'm going to get to reviewing Door Kickers (DK).What is Door Kickers?You know what Rainbow Six (R6) is? If you don't, scroll down to the bottom of my review where I tell you a bit about R6. If you do, well, that's what DK is, except for three differences: DK is a top-down tactical shooter / R6 is an FPS tactical shooter DK is very easy and light to just pick up and play, whenever, wherever. Coffee break, lunch hour, taking a sh*t (if there will ever be a tablet version, which is very much possible if the dev bothers), doing your whatever thing with your laptop at Starbucks, etc. DK has you control a SWAT team with a considerably wide range of Law Enforcement Organization (LEO)-level gear / R6 has you control a bunch of hardened and specialized team of tacticool genius-level operator dudes and chicks bearing a very-wide range of military-grade toysThat's it. The rest, everything you remember from your fondest R6 days - choosing, equipping and leveling up your squads (with different classes), breach gadgets, planning your maneuvers, your button-hooks, wedges/pies, rescuing hostages, defusing bombs, capturing HVTs, retrieving intel/evidence, or straight-up delivering 'Merica to the bad guys - it's all there, AND THEN SOME: ""Doctrine"" system - a set of RPG-like skill trees, each specializing in different weapons and engagement discipline. DK is constantly updated with new contents such as campaigns and maps by both the devs and the awesomely capable community. DK has loads of awesome mods in the workshop. ATM there are: an R6-themed sound overhaul, loads of new military-grade weapons and operator skins for those who want a change in atmosphere, and tons of custom maps designed by the community. DK lets you watch a replay of your mission, record it with a built-in recorder, and even choose a point from your replay, and re-do the mission from said point. LEVEL EDITOR - need I say more?So, with the basic features explained, what are the pros and cons?PROS: A mix of casual and hardcore: play how you want - easy-breezy, smash and shoot your way into the sh*t (which will most likely get your team or the hostage killed), OR take your time with recon (slow is smooth, smooth is fast), OR a mix of both (scout a bit, get in and improvise as necessary). Like R6, watching the result of your hardly-worked planning go down (especially when it goes right), like when your team is smoothly moving in, covering every angle, or when they smash in hard and fast and smack the bad guys who's having their thumbs up their behind, is simply indescribable. Config files are easy to manipulate, which lets you alter the in-game assets (weapons stats and attributes etc.) to your preference, also makes modding easier Replay feature Considerable replayability Awesome community-made contents Devs that DELIVARRRRSCONS: MIGHT get boring once you've aced all the maps and campaigns, and have run out of custom contents to play around with, but that's a given with any single-player games. Last I checked, the replay feature is still a little imperfect, where it sometimes ""desyncs"" and fail to play to the end. IMHO the breaching features can still be polished, in terms of set-pieces, such as a more snappy flash-entry or frag-entry. Not enough non-lethal options: so far there's only the taser-gun, but the workshop is quick to remedy this by offering a wide array of community-made non-lethal options (the super-painful-non-lethal-but-I-might-as-well-be-dead-if-I-get-shot-with-this bean bag rounds, rubber/silicone bullets, etc.)So, do you recommend it?Does the leader of a popular religion defecate in remote areas of the forest?11/10 as far am I'm concerned, and I'm not even kidding.What in the hell is R6?You see, most of you who are below 20 most probably haven't heard of the R6 series, apart from the Vegas installments which are NOT what R6 really is. R6 is a hardcore tactical shooter where you control a team of counter-terrorist squad during various tactically-demanding operations, be it recon, seek & destroy, search & rescue, and bomb defusal. The R6 initiative, a fictional covert counter-terrorist organization born from the mind of the great Tom Clancy (a great, great author, despite the heavy political bias in his novels), specializes in going where the regular LEO can't go or has been terribly outmatched, where a swift and precise tactical intervention is severely needed, and where the faintest of the slightest hint of NATO involvement will stir up some real sh*t, so even the most specialest and tacticoolest of operators can't go. Oh, wait, that last bit is Splinter Cell. Sorry.You see, at least as far as I understand from my various encounter with Hollywood pop-culture, there are a few levels of domestic LEO, which deals in different levels of criminal situations: Some drunk guy smacked his loud-mouthed wife about? You send out a dispatch so the local PD on his beat will go in and check it out. Convenience store in a stick-up? Local PD. A junkie with an illegal 9mm he got from Motherf*cker Jones is holding his neighbor for ransom because he can't afford his fix? You might wanna call the SWAT to back the local PD up, just in case it really gets out of hand. Local gang drinking party turned into a violent shootout because of a domestic disturbance warrant serve turned a little too serious? A homosexual man and his totally straight crew decides to rob a sleepy bank, but it turned into a messy hostage situation? Definitely call in the SWAT, AND the FBI HRT. A maniacal cartel kingpin from across the border decides that the Narc, ATF and/or Feds have been too nosy and destroyed too much of their business decides to send a hit squad and shoot up a local PD HQ? An extremist militant cell rounded up and locked in a huge bunch of civs in a big library and set-off a timed dirty bomb in it? The UN conference was smashed in and every world leader is held hostage with demands of the US to hand over all their nukes? THESE, you call in the R6. Except for the last part with the UN? Yeah that's definitely Ghost Recon turf. "

												S.W.A.T. meets the original Rainbow Six planning interface with a plethora of missions, agents, weapons and achievements to keep the hungriest tactical fanatic engaged.  This game surprised me in how well it captures tactical close quarters combat in urban environments with such a simple yet effective presentation / UI.  The graphics are detailed and communicate a sense of realism without trying to be photorealistic.But where the game really shines is in the depth of strategy that is involved in developing a plan and executing it with flawless precision.  The only thing that gives that a run for its money is when things go horribly wrong and you still manage to salvage the mission through quick thinking, dumb blind luck and grit.  Rarely do you feel like you ""got away"" with something due to A.I. glitches which further elevates the feeling of success when you pull of a great plan.If you like strategy games do yourself a favour and give this one a go.

												The store page description said it clear: Real Time with Free Pause No turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfaces Realistic but action packed Those points made me buy the game, and I was never disappointed. Door Kickers is best SWAT type tactical strategy you will ever play. The game offers many customization for your squad, many type of weapons and tools to choose from. There are tons of missions and campaigns, with ability to build your own mission and share it on steamwrokshop. The main things that made me really enjoy this game is the planning, the more you plan and make sure you use the right tools in right position the more of chance you will pass the mission, the beautiful thing that once you hit the unpause button you will see how your orchestrated plan going, and if it works as you plan and succeed, you will feel the satisfaction in such way that you will never feel it in any other similar game. The game use simple 2D graphics, but with many details to reload and recoil of each weapon.I totally recommend this game for any tactical games fans, it is great value of money. "

												(To preface, this was originally written as a not-recommended and has changed back and forth many times. My thoughts are still exactly the same, but my tolerance of the problems has increased a little bit as time goes on. Take from that what you will.)If I could give this game a ""Neutral"" rather than a ""Recommended"", I would do that instead.This game has a lot of strong pros and a lot of strong cons. I'd recommend reading the details to determine if the game is for you rather than taking the recommend at face value!So the best way I can describe this game is if you take Frozen Synapse and SWAT (4, not 3) and combine them into a game with quick objectives and short but satisfying levels. You'll be tasked to take your organized team, breach and enter various locations, and complete various objectives such as neutralizing terrorists, rescuing hostages, retreiving evidence, and such.You can either choose to plan out your assault completely from the start and play it out, or you can organize it in chunks with a handy pause function. Pausing makes the game a bit easier but making a single plan can be very rewarding.The game has a mission generator (which is less of a generator since it basically grabs a random mission layout and randomizes the enemy and objective layout). There's a lot of content here for you to keep playing, granted you don't mind having a limited amount of variety in the way of objectives and how you handle them (which is not a bad thing since that's a lot how real scenarios play out - like the book).Real life tactics can come into handy play here minus a few key ideas such as leaning- though I'm not sure how it would work given its control scheme......Which is where the problems start to become evident.You see, the way you set a path for your SWAT members to follow is you click and drag them one. In order to place actions along the path, you create nodes on it by right clicking. This makes sense in theory but it has several hangups which severly ruin the flow. Rather than having to delete parts of your path manually to change them, you just pick a part earlier and draw from there which will erase everything that comes after that spot. Unfortunately, it's very easy to do this by accident and the game lacks any sort of undo functionality. This can result in you spending upwards to 5 - 10 minutes making an intricate path only to accidentally change the wrong team member's path or mis click, wasting your time having to redo it.The game also has a large auto-snap when highlighting notes, making precision very difficilt. If you have multiple teammates on a similar path with each of their nodes next to each other, the game turns into a frustrating pixel hunt trying to get the correct officer in the correct part of the path.The game also has some problematic design choices that clash with the subject matter. Namely that the game wants to you play very fast score wise (and some missions require you to be fast with as quick as a 10 second or less time limit for hostages) yet actively discourages fast playing with realistic health and mobility stats that change with weaponry and body armor. In order to get 3 stars for the mission, one of the requirements is to beat a certain time. This wouldn't be a problem but these times are very unforgiving, often forcing you to ignore your officer's safety in favor of working very quickly. Often you'll find that you won't have time use a spy camera or silently pick a lock as you'll compromise your score.Now, if score was only for personal gratification and leaderboards, I wouldn't have a problem with this design. However, you use the stars that you unlock in order to purchase other weapons, body armor, and tools. If you're earning less stars per mission, you're going to progress a bit slower.The progression itself isn't terribly slow, but it also feels like a system that's designed to limit the players' toolsets rather than give them options. It's restrictive and ultimately pointless as a lot of unlockables aren't worth it compared to the superior options. What you'll most likely do (and a lot of players also recommend this) is to find an easy generated mission and grind it until you have all the stars you need to unlock what you want. You won't be doing it for long, as unlocked items are unlocked for everybody (as opposed to per officer), I feel like this artificially extends playtime rather than actively engaging the player. This could have been done better. It's not a dealbreaker but it's also needlessly frustrating for the first one or two hours of play.This isn't to suggest that the game is bad, however. Like I already said, if I could give this game a Neutral rating, I would.While I didn't experiment much with it, the game has a really neat campaign mode where officers that are killed during missions are permenently dead. Since you also train your officers as part of the progression system, this can make for a really interesting dynamic where you need to take the risk of sending in your best trained officers to deal with a mission but have the possibility of losing them, or sending in worse officers at the risk of performing the mission not as well. It's not terribly fleshed out, but it's still interesting.The game can also be really satisfying when you're not fighting the mechanics or design choices. It's a really strong idea and it works well enough, but some of the execution falls a bit flat.If it sounds like these things wouldn't bother you much or you're willing to look past them, then by all means pick this game up- as there is a lot of fun to be had here. However, if you think these will bother you, then either wait until this game is on sale or wait for Door Kickers 2. Apparently some issues may be fixed there and I think it's worth keeping note of.Hopefully this helped! And yes, I know this review will have a very low number of votes because people downvote most negative reviews for whatever reason. So thanks for reading if you got this far!			"

												Hostage Situations, Drug Busts, High-Profile Criminal Arrests - all in a day's work for Nowhere City Police Department's Special Weapons And Tactics unit.A decent and addictive tactical game with complex but at the same time pretty simple mechanics. If you ever played older Rainbow Six and SWAT games - you'll feel right at home. 100+ missions to complete in vanilla game, tons of equipment and operational possibilities, not to mention map editor, workshop content and developers support. Must own for every tactical gaming fan, with -50% off it's a steal.			"

												I consider this game a spiritual successor to the original Rainbow Six titles. You select your roster, change their loadouts for the mission, plan their points of entry and the paths they'll take during the mission, then you watch it all come to life. If you're quick enough, you can change your squad members' tactics on the fly in real-time, or you can just pause the action and make your adjustments from there. All in all, this game feels very good and it's easy to lose hours retrying one mission just to make it come out perfectly.Unlike Rainbow Six, you actually have to unlock all of the different weapons and specializations which gives the game a bit of an RPG feel, if not a bit frustrating for people who immediately want to use an assault rifle. There's multiple stock campaigns, and a good amount of user-created content as well. If you're looking for a true spiritual successor to OG R6, and are willing to settle for top-down graphics, this game is for you.			"

												PROS: Huge amount of doors you can kick. Also, you can kill many door owners who doesn't want their doors being kicked.CONS: There are doors that can't be kicked. Developers should focus in that issue as soon as possible.  Why every door owner is a NRA member? That's confusing for non american players and it's not explained by the game plot.SUMMARY:If you like kicking furniture to splinters and get into hard troubles with violent landlords, this game is highly recommended.Don't buy It if you have too much carpentry sensibility. Furniture explicitly suffers in this game.			"

												During a 50% off sale, the dev Vulpe told me this game was worth more than £7, and that it was the cheapest it was going to be. I quote him directly: ""The game will not be discounted lower than 50%"". I like to think of myself as a generous man, but his comment on the price not going any lower only brought out my love and desire to take on a challenge. The waiting game began. Months and months passed, and the summer sale had begun. I see Door Kickers with a 60% off tag, but my excitement is contained. Not even a grin or smirk is shown. I wasn't going to give in this easily. It's 3 minutes until the new daily and flash sales begin. I refresh the Steam store at 6PM on the dot. I browse the deals, and to my disappointment, Door Kickers has not been discounted further. A week passes and the 60% is still there.  Not a single daily or flash has contained this game. My mind is filled with Vulpe's manic laughter, I hallucinate him & Gabe knocking at my door. I have nightmares where they tear my wallet from my pants and spend all my money gifting Door Kickers to people I'm not even friends with. I want to take the plunge, but my instinct tells me it isn't over yet. I've been sitting at my computer for 4 days straight now. Just waiting for new sales, refreshing over and over. I haven't slept. I haven't eaten. It's 6AM. I refresh the store for the morning flash sale. There it is. Door Kickers, 75% off. I sit in silence at first. I feel relief, and I feel pain. A tear falls down my cheek, and I click add to cart. I pay £3.75 and the game is mine. I sit back in my chair as the game installs, and laugh like I've lost my mind. I did it, I thought to myself. I persevered and reaped the rewards.I'm 3 hours into the game, and I start crying. Vulpe, you were right; I can confirm this game is worth more than £7. Thank you for this emotional journey. Well played, Vulpe. Well played.			"

												Great ""simple"" tacticool title, albeit with some minor scuffs.The game mechanics are VERY easy to learn, yet surprisingly complex, so you can easily get into the game quickly, but will be working for a LONG time to master the game. And yes, this is one of those games where you will WANT to 3 star a level. So, while the levels themselves aren't super diverse(some are, but most aren't), you will want to keep re-attempting them for that perfect run(ala R6).The game definitely has some small issues still though, but ALL of these could be patched easily:* still hard to properly orient your guys throughout the process. Yes, there are ""two"" modes of look direction(strafe + body facing), but the game doesn't seem to always follow what you have selected(sometimes you'll find your guys walking backwards into a room...)* still issues with ""overlapping"" unit movement and proper selection. ie: if unit A and unit B are traveling close together...it's VERY hard to select A and orient him; oftentimes the game will make it hard to select A or B, so I would recommend a way to ""dim"" or outright remove other unit pathing temporarily during the setup process to avoid this* randomness(a good thing and a bad thing): there are times when you'll just do the SIMPLEST layout(with no facing setup) and it will be flawless...other times you'll put lots of effort into a perfect run...only to see your ""elite"" soldier stand in a doorway and eat a magazine dump...* some of the weapon options/classes are kind of pointless. Outside of a maybe 1-2 missions...there just isn't any use for the shield class. Same thing for weapons: there are a couple that are CLEAR standouts in their grouping...and you'll be using them 99% of the time...so yea...sucks for the rest of them* ""silent"" mode is still buggy. Too many times you'll have your guys barge into a room and not fire, even when hostages/team members are in immediate danger, all the while...you have to press the ""fire"" button to give them permission(or at least override their behavior). Sometimes they work right, sometimes they don't. Kinda weird. Some kind of ROE options would be nice here or another planning option to let them override silent mode for a specific walk* $20 price point is IMO a little steep for what it offers. The devs are awesome and they have been consistent with updates so far, so it's worth rewarding them for the time I've put into it. For a new player, I'd think $15 would be more the sweetspot(check out Steam sales later in the year).tl;dr: The game boils down to attempting to perfect missions, ala R6. The base mechanics are easy enough to learn, but you will spend a fair amount of time retrying missions until things click together.See these webm videos for further evidence of how great this game is:http://a.pomf.se/jwkctw.webmhttp://a.pomf.se/wmpprv.webm "

								Door Kickers. I couldnt say enough good things about this game. For just being in alpha with ""limited features"" this is probably been the best few hours of my whole gaming collection of stratagy. The depth of the stratagy available and the cool sound of ""tango down"" every few seconds. If you like rts/action games this is well worth its price. Infinate replayability with generated missions plus many hand crafted scenarios make me really anticipate the campaign they have to offer.

												Excellent tactics game where you can pause to issue orders and watch them unfold on real-time. Good variety of weapons, map generator and level editor extends replayability. The engine suffers from some limitatios but this is the first game by Killhose Games. Looking forward to a sequel or implentation of the design on another setting. Others developers should look closely at this game, would give anything to see this combat implemented to let´s say Jagged Alliance.Overall outstanding indie game, lacks a litte flavor but the combat design more than make up for it.

												Doorkickers is a fun, challenging shooting puzzle game with a tactical paintjob and some forgetable RPG elements. Let me start by saying that Door Kickers is not what I really hoped it to be: a spiritual successor to the Swat line of games. Remember those? They were the counter to most shooting games because you could get the best victory with the fewest shots fired. A careful and well-planned approach was more useful than  running and gunning. Being cautious was almost always better than being fast. Door kickers has none of that. The goal is generally to kill everyone besides your team that has a gun on the map. DK isn't a police simulator or even that much of a tactical simulator (for reasons I'll go into below)- it's a puzzle game. But it's fun and I found it delivered plenty. In general DK wants you to complete the mission without losing any of your guys and in the shortest time possible. This usually means killing all suspects but you're also tasked with preventing the execution of hostages and demolition of bombs. Keep in mind not only are the suspects absurdly numerous but they throw grenades at your guys. Yeah. There are also some extra goals for each mission, like using a single trooper, not pausing, or using only one plan. These are sometimes neat little challenges but other times are frustrating or, sometimes, impossible due to the design of the mission (some impossible challenges have been removed in patches, I suspect more will be later). As I said there's not much cautiousness allowed if you want the full score for a mission. Instead you go in fast and if it doesn't work, just restart and try again. Repeat until you succeed below the time limit. It seems the newly added campaign missions are a little less strict for time. You can build your squad but there's not much individualism there. You can put backer's names and faces in to personalize a trooper but that's it: no backstories, special skilles, interactions, etc. Fans of Jagged Allience (or to some degree Swat 2) shouldn't expect much here. Troopers advance in 3 skills as they go along but I honestly can't tell much of a difference between an expert and novice trooper. You can gain your whole squad certain skills\upgrades which are sometimes useful but many are bizarre in that they replicate what should be normal behavior. For example: being able to hold fire when not under threat. Given the micromanagement elsewhere I don't see why it's even an upgrade instead of an inate ability. It's really tiring to be trying to do a stealthy approach and the guy you've armed with a carbine decides to blow away an enemy across the map who has no idea what's going on, thereby alerting everyone. The ""skill"" in question would also be much more useful if it were a toggle rather than the way it is implemented as a button that must be pressed every time one wants to fire. I'm also not sure how a squad needs to ""learn"" how to open doors instead of noisily kicking them. I've tried both, and opening a door is easier and more tactically sound!There are lots of guns and devices. Most are redundent and add little but it's nice to have some variety. Some of the weapon stats are very unrealistic. It seems that a .45 caliber pistol is easily more powerful ('stopping power') than a UMP45, which is basically the very same cartridge in a longer barrel and therefore more velocity. Looking at the stats it might even be more powerful than a assault rifle! It doesn't make any sense and I'm not sure if it's as a 'balance' issue or rule of cool. There really is no arresting necessary, except for those missions that present unarmed subjects specifically targeted for arrest. Nor is it easy to arrest suspects, as they never voluntarily drop their weapons and the troopers don't give them a chance to do so anyway. The only real way I've found to arrest armed suspects is to tase them and then cuff them while they are disabled. This is a tricky and very risky move when there's more than one suspect around and there's really no reason to do it since putting a bullet through someone leads to the same result.   The enemy AI is pretty dumb. There's a mod to leave dead bodies on the ground instead of having them vanish and I think I know why it is not the default... it looks absurd how many bodies will be lying in the same spot. You'd think once you kill the first 3 guys who walk out a door there would be a change in tactics. That would be a mistake. By all means, keep shooting them as they march out as if they're cattle. The only thing stopping you is the need to occasionally change magazines (from your unlimited supply) and the time ticking away. But on later missions the poor AI is hidden with absolutely STUPID levels of armor for the enemies who, while still dumb, will manage to murder your troopers immediately upon seeing them from 150 yards away.♥♥♥♥♥♥ why don't we hire these criminals? They're vastly better than anything the good guys can do. Plus they never have to reload (had a guy firing a shotgun at me for 2 minutes without pause). Friendly AI is also robotic (the only thing giving the bad guys a fighting chance in addition to their absurd numbers and lots of access points). You need to micromanage everything if you want to get a good result, to the extent where you need to manually direct the troopers in a 'slicing pie' movement to clear a doorway (otherwise they'll tend to sorta just charge in and promptly get shot). Troopers will respond to being shot... eventually... but that seems to be the only stimulus that will get their attention. They seem to be of two minds as to whether they'll address a threat in an area not specifically designated as 'their' cover zone. Usually this means they'll ignore it if it's important and engage it like flies on♥♥♥♥♥♥if it's NOT important. So if there's two bad guys and one is disco dancing while the other is moving to shoot the hostage, it seems like the troopers go for the dancer. Well, okay, can't blame them for that, but I wish there was a way to designate a target out of several visible. So if it sounds like I'm negative about this game, it's just because I wanted something a little more like Swat 2. But the game is addictive and if you buy it knowing you're getting a tacticalish puzzle shooter you can have a lot of fun. It's nice to play things out in slow motion and the RT\Pause action works quite well (on single story buildings). Watching the replay afterwards can be fun as it brings everything together. The dev-team seems responsive to the community and there is modding (as well as a mission editor). It strikes me as one of those games that just demands 'one more try' even when you should probably be out mowing the lawn. I believe I paid $15 for the early access and that seems to me to be a good price-point for the game.			"

												For those who have struggle systems and wish they could cop Rainbow Six: Siege, Door Kickers is more than just an adequate substitute; it is a tactical game worthy of play and praise on its own terms. KillHouse Games has done its homework in terms of researching the qualities of guns such as the P90, the Benelli M4 (Joint Service Combat Shotgun), Tarvor, SAR-21 and more. This research extends to considering factors such as cornering with large weapons and reload speeds. For those looking for a good tactics game, they need not look farther than Door Kickers.Full Review at Geeks Under Grace	[www.geeksundergrace.com] "

												This is a game about door kicking. You get to kick a lot of doors, under many different circumstances. You have a squad of door kickers who somehow get better at other things, but not so much at door kicking.Usually there are people on the other side of the doors you kicked. They don't like you and shoot at you. I can only presume they are upset because they would have liked to kick the doors themselves. You can buy better weapons and armor to deal with these unpleasant interruptions better so you can get back to door kicking.Some doors can't be kicked right away. You have to do things to them first. Basically, they're playing hard to get. But they want to get kicked, and you'll kick them eventually. You know they like it.			"

												I bought doorkickers for 50% off and finished the whole game in 47 hours, tried some mods and had a all-in-all very enjoyable game-expierience. I bought this game, because I wanted to find a game, which was similar to the good old SWAT4 (Control a SWAT team, save hostages, defuse bombs) and even thou there are many differences (well, doorkickers is a top-down-RTS game, while SWAT4 was a egoshooter), I really enjoyed having 4 human-controlled-teammember, who don't waste their entire time shooting themselfes with pepperguns on the spawn. 9/10 this game needs pepperguns.

												Door kicker is just like the more tactical version of the old game named ""SWAT4""(go play it if you like this type of game)Door kicker is the game that allows you to use many different ways to ""kick doors"". Multiple roles and gears vary the style of your door kicking.I will rate this game 9 out of 10.The only 1 point that ""Door kicker"" misses is that campign is too damn hard.

												Playing this game for the first time felt like finding a hidden gem in my library. I got it in a bundle because I love team tactics inside turn-based games (UFO: EU child, here) but took my sweet time to try it. So happy I did.Fast-paced, mission driven game where you are constantly improving and rewards you with a huge sense of accomplishment. You can tinker with almost everything, creating mini-games inside the game, deepening the many challenges/goals that Doorkickers already puts in place for you.If you like managing a squad (roles,inventory) and sending them to fight ""tangos"" using a great mix of RTS with pause/pre-planning Frozen Synapse style combat, give Doorkickers a try.

								Door Kickers. I couldnt say enough good things about this game. For just being in alpha with ""limited features"" this is probably been the best few hours of my whole gaming collection of stratagy. The depth of the stratagy available and the cool sound of ""tango down"" every few seconds. If you like rts/action games this is well worth its price. Infinate replayability with generated missions plus many hand crafted scenarios make me really anticipate the campaign they have to offer. Fun game, like the kind of fun i used to have when i first started playing games. BUY THIS.			"

												Great ""simple"" tacticool title, albeit with some minor scuffs.The game mechanics are VERY easy to learn, yet surprisingly complex, so you can easily get into the game quickly, but will be working for a LONG time to master the game. And yes, this is one of those games where you will WANT to 3 star a level. So, while the levels themselves aren't super diverse(some are, but most aren't), you will want to keep re-attempting them for that perfect run(ala R6).The game definitely has some small issues still though, but ALL of these could be patched easily:* still hard to properly orient your guys throughout the process. Yes, there are ""two"" modes of look direction(strafe + body facing), but the game doesn't seem to always follow what you have selected(sometimes you'll find your guys walking backwards into a room...)* still issues with ""overlapping"" unit movement and proper selection. ie: if unit A and unit B are traveling close together...it's VERY hard to select A and orient him; oftentimes the game will make it hard to select A or B, so I would recommend a way to ""dim"" or outright remove other unit pathing temporarily during the setup process to avoid this* randomness(a good thing and a bad thing): there are times when you'll just do the SIMPLEST layout(with no facing setup) and it will be flawless...other times you'll put lots of effort into a perfect run...only to see your ""elite"" soldier stand in a doorway and eat a magazine dump...* some of the weapon options/classes are kind of pointless. Outside of a maybe 1-2 missions...there just isn't any use for the shield class. Same thing for weapons: there are a couple that are CLEAR standouts in their grouping...and you'll be using them 99% of the time...so yea...sucks for the rest of them* ""silent"" mode is still buggy. Too many times you'll have your guys barge into a room and not fire, even when hostages/team members are in immediate danger, all the while...you have to press the ""fire"" button to give them permission(or at least override their behavior). Sometimes they work right, sometimes they don't. Kinda weird. Some kind of ROE options would be nice here or another planning option to let them override silent mode for a specific walk* $20 price point is IMO a little steep for what it offers. The devs are awesome and they have been consistent with updates so far, so it's worth rewarding them for the time I've put into it. For a new player, I'd think $15 would be more the sweetspot(check out Steam sales later in the year).tl;dr: The game boils down to attempting to perfect missions, ala R6. The base mechanics are easy enough to learn, but you will spend a fair amount of time retrying missions until things click together.See these webm videos for further evidence of how great this game is:http://a.pomf.se/jwkctw.webmhttp://a.pomf.se/wmpprv.webm "

												Let's start saying I like this game. It's fun, there's different ways to get to every objective, lots of tactics involved.You need luck too, but that's just a minor thing, and it makes things even more realistic.Graphics are nicely done, sound could be better (so... my ""Angela"" has a male voice?) but it's good enough, maybe a few more character customization options would be nice.HOWEVER, there are two things that prevent me from recommending the game.BUGSI've just completed the ""Cartel Beach Party"" mission, it took me about an hour to get three stars in it. That's because the plan I was using (which is the one I think is best to accomplish this goal) relied pretty heavily in having two shields and two assaulters, with shields opening the doors to small rooms while assaulters had to flashbang and then kill the guys in the bigger areas, plus the final shootout in the living room. The problems here are four:1. Shields ALWAYS turn their back to a door while opening it, getting hit AT LEAST once each time.2. Shields sometime go through the doors before opening them, exposing themselves to enemy fire.3. Enemies can sometimes shoot through walls if they're close to a unit.4. Units sometimes get stuck in front of doors with their guns lowered, exposing themselves to enemy fire and not reacting.This is far more than what I can stand, considering these bugs compromised my mission to the point I had to restart it 20+ times to get lucky enough not to get hit.STARSThe Stars system is beyond frustrating. You get X stars based on how many stars you get in a mission, and they only count once (unless you get a higher rank, in that case the latest obtained stars are added). With items costing 10+ stars, and with stars being non-farmable, a poor equipment choice will doom your missions to failure.I got 3 stars on almost every mission up to the first rescue missions, and (probably) wasted my stars in not-so-good equipment. Now, I can still progress in the game, but I think my units would last longer with, say, a better armor.They really need to change the Stars to something new, or at least make them farmable.In the very end, it's a shame this game has these two problems. Other than that, it's a great game.			"

												Do you like a tactical shooter? That requires you to think, plan, and rapidly respond to situations? If not, then you might as well leave. If you try to run and gun your entire squad will die in no less than 5-10 seconds (I wish I was joking), This game is brutal, but it is so rewarding when you win without losing  a single squad member, and it's a helluva lotta fun getting there. Bottom line is that this game is incredible, but it depends on what type of game you like. If you're the Call of Duty, run and gun player this game isn't for you. If you're the Arma II, tactical shooter who likes stratgey, this game is a must buy. it's so much fun and best of all, it's constantly being updated! Honestly, get this game!			"

You have to clear rooms and save hostages, take out all the enemies and defuse bombs.The one and ONLY gripe I have is just the way the room clearing works. The game ends when you have killed all terrorists, even if you haven't cleared the other rooms.

												Bought this game quite recently, but already I love it. It's a great overhead 2D game where you control a SWAT team and have to command them tactically through hostile situations. Here's a quick overview:PROS(+++) Mission Variety -- There are many types of missions: there are ""clear all hostiles"" missions, hostage rescues, domb defusal, arrests, friendly escorts, and even a mode where you must collect evidence before criminals destory it. The game has plenty of ""official missions"", which are pre-rendered maps with variations of these missions; you can play these many times to improve your results and earn medals. It also has campaigns, which make the injuries and deaths on your squad have permanence and require you to safely lead your men through each mission. Most importantly, however, is the random mission generator, which picks maps at random and assigns varying scenarios and missions, or genreates maps for you to clear; this is especially fun when you set the genration options to random and aren't sure what you'll get in terms of enemy strength. Finally, there is a map editor and the ability to download other people's maps, and with the devs themselves adding new missions and campaigns as the game goes on, the challenges won't likely run out anytime soon.(++) Squad Scaling -- Throwing a little RPG into the mix, the game provides you with experience -- both for each trooper and the squad as a whole -- after each mission. These can be used to unlock skills for the whole squad, and each trooper will increase their own stats as you use them. You also unlock more weapons and equipment as you earn stars for completing missions quickly and without losing men, and its fun to level and gear up as you beat more and more missions, making armored or armed enemeies easier to handle.(++) Enjoyable gameplay -- The enemy varieties and randomness in each mission gives each scenario a freshness, and requires you to keep thinking through encounters instead of just doing the same thing over and over (although the restart button is there when you need it). It's a great experience if you've ever wanted to command a SWAT team and hear them shout ""Clear! Clear!"" as they systematically put bullets into hostiles.CONS(-) Controls/Interface -- Once you get used to them, the path-drawing/command-giving controls are fairly intuitive and work 90% of the time. However, as I've found with a few top-down tactics games, you don't always get the full level of control you'd want when working with your men. In certain cases, such as when two trooper's paths overlap or giving orders that stack commands on door opening, you'll misclick and put your shotgunner in front of your riot shielder or send a man through a door backwards. There are a few things the interface could do to alleviate this (such as perhaps showing unit paths one at a time, or giving a little more control over what order door opening actions are performed in) but overall it is a minor problem that usually causes little trouble once you know what to watch for.(-) Squad Scaling -- I know this was under PROS as well, but I found that my squad was fully trained and upgraded with the gear I wanted after only a few hours of gameplay. The rest of the upgrades, then, just felt like I was unlocking gear for the sake of using up my XP or stars, and now, though I still enjoy the missions, I've run out of things to unlock. Perhaps adding more unlockables or more squad skill trees would help keep advancement fresh as the game is played longer, though the focus of this game is on individual tactical missions and not squad progression.OVERALLIf you ever dreamed of virtually barking tactical decisions over radio to a SWAT team engaging hostiles, get this game. Hours of fun for sure. "

												Do you like a tactical shooter? That requires you to think, plan, and rapidly respond to situations? If not, then you might as well leave. If you try to run and gun your entire squad will die in no less than 5-10 seconds (I wish I was joking), This game is brutal, but it is so rewarding when you win without losing  a single squad member, and it's a helluva lotta fun getting there. Bottom line is that this game is incredible, but it depends on what type of game you like. If you're the Call of Duty, run and gun player this game isn't for you. If you're the Arma II, tactical shooter who likes stratgey, this game is a must buy. it's so much fun and best of all, it's constantly being updated! Honestly, get this game!			"

I don't really have problems with the game (again, that price tag doesn't leave much room for nitpicks) but I wish there was more realism in weapon stats, more abilities when around doors, cover, enemies, hostages, etc, and prettier/more stylized graphics.

 NOTE: This review was last updated on 19 Dec, 2014 @ 4:49pm. Things I talked about may now be irrelevant. I will update this review in the near future as I have stopped progressively playing Doorkickers.As much as want to enjoy Door Kickers, as I am a big fan of Tactic RTS's , this one has given me the most frustation yet, and not in a good, challenging way either. Although my hours spent on this game at the time of this review is few, the movement mechanics have already hindered a positive impression from me. Often times, the fault in my plans is not in my ability, but in the broken mechanics of the game. When things work out and bugs such as shooting at the wall because the target is to my characters adjacent isn't a problem, the game is fun. Watching my team swiftly move in and clearing the area under a designated time feel rewarding and I can see what the dev's envision. But, having a constant struggle with things like redoing my carefully laid out plan because adding a step would somehow erase the previous ones, or, being unable to peak around the corner of a doorway because the action menu of breaching methods block my cursor from selecting my move node, breaks the experience for me. Among all my concerns however, the two big annoyances are when my team disregards the assigned command call (ex. Alpha, Bravo), and moves in on their own, and, when the units move before clearing a newly breached room. The work around for for the first issue is to redo my whole plan which, as mentioned before, is a chore that takes away from the fun. Although my review has mostly been negative, this is not a bad game at all. In fact, I would recommend you to give it as try as this review is soley based on my own critique. You may overlook these minor flaws and thoroughly enjoy this game. But for me, these minor issues were little details that became a major hassle as I played on.			"

												Good game, but there is one MAJOR flaw that's annoying me to make me give it a negative review: Sometime when you quit a misson during campaign, for example when you double press ESC, then instead of quiting the game, you're actually starting the campaign from the beginning(not in iron man mod). Something is very wrong with the game interference. This issur ruined my hours of gameplay and mood for playing it again.			"

												The game is quite fun, and there are some elements I'm excited about that are hard to find in other games. However, there are some serious flaws that made me not want to recommend this game.The biggest reason is the nonsense ""progression system"", squad leveling and classes. It simply doesn't make that you only start with pistols, but later, once you have ""progressed"", you can replay the missions with more and usually *better* equipment! It just makes the game easier and more boring faster. The classes determine what equipment can be used, and it's pretty arbitrary. For example,the point man class can only use pistols. That is, no SMGs(!) It seems the reason is because the pointman has to be fast. But come on, not even a small SMG? And the speed brings me to another point:Your 'troopers' walk at different speeds depending on their class and loadout. This makes sense, but it causes trouble; if you want to keep some formation while moving you will often find some of your troopers either running ahead of the others or lagging behind. According to the loading screen tips your troopers can shoot over each other's heads when in tight formation, but there's no way to know if you've achieved that. The speed difference / lack of proper formation also messes up timing.Synchronizing actions is a real hassle. You get four (4) 'go codes' which can be used for synchronizing actions. This is not enough! For example, if you want to stack up at a corner, throw a flashbang around it and then have your stack move out you will have to use two go codes: One for stacking up before your pointman throws the flashbang, and another to keep the rest of your stack moving out before the flashbang has been deployed.The planning editor is quite horrible. It's easy to make mistakes, and making changes is difficult or even impossible forcing you to delete potentially large parts of your plan.Lastly, I *really* hate when your troopers say ""no tangos"". It's too easy to misinterpret as ""tangos""!! It's quite minor, but it's been driving me crazy.			"

												I would contrast my experience with Door Kickers with my experience with Starbound. With Starbound I tried and failed so many times that I completly lost my temper and uninstalled it. With Starbound there was no fun in failure. In Door Kickers, it is incredibly fun to fail.  In fact this would be my measure of a good game.			"

												The game is so great. I played an very very early alpha build and totally loved it as it kind of reminded me of original SWAT 1 and SWAT 2 games but with precision as a focus. At that point I was sceptical of it and I wasn't sure if it's really going to make it out of alpha and to the full product. Now it's on steam and it's even better than I expected with the addition of custom loudouts, full mod support, randomly generated missions etc.It's great and well worth the price. Only thing that it lacks is a borderless fullscreen.			"

												I adopted Doorkickers  a few months before they hit early access. One thing I can same about Killhouse is that they work thier butts off to deliver on promises and content and are contstanly engaging the players and impleementing ideas. I know the price tag may seem a little higher than what you would be willing to spend on a title like this. My best advice to you is: Don't worry about the $, This title will give you hours of gameplay and you wont regret your purchase at all.			"

One complaint I have is the campaign's lack of story. It does seem like its just a bunch of random levels, rather than a story weaving them together.

												In most respects this is a fun, thoughtfully executed game but it is rendered almost unplayable because of the lack of an ""undo"" option. This lack, combined with the fact that it is very easy to accidentally delete the convoluted plans required to avoid pausing during levels, makes the planning phase of the game all too often an exercise in frustration. Until some kind of undo functionality is added into the game, I would not recommend it unless you want to play the levels in small chunks, pausing to issue orders every few seconds (thus removing most of the interest and challenge).

								If you're a fan of any of the SWAT games or just like the tactical/spec-ops genre, buy this game. It's simple, yet unforgiving.

								Door Kickers is a really good game which I recommend to all of my friends, but also to all the internert strangers. At first it is daunting to get all the basics down, but once you have those and know how to work your team, it is an absolute beaut of a game. It always feels great when I manage to clear out a level full of hostiles quickly and quietly, managing to save all the hostages from execution. It is a simple game to use, but it is also challenging at the same time, as it is no easy achievement to gain all three stars on all the levels. If you don't get it until now - BUY THIS GAME! :)			"

												Excellent game plagued by a single awful problem: in the campaigns (not the single missions), if you lose a trooper and don't restart the mission, he's permanently dead. This is exacerbated by the game sometimes not recognizing your request to restart a mission... so you decided to try out a bold strategy on a campaign mission? Too bad, your best troopers are now gone forever. I've actually uninstalled until they fix this as it's just wantonly stupid. Still recommended, but don't touch the campaigns unless you're okay with a whole new roster of rookies.			"

												A lot of fun in Door Kickers comes from the failures.And unless you're endowed with the tactical genius of an Alexander the Great or Napoleon Bonaparte, you're going to fail a lot.Door Kickers is a top-down tactics game with an emphasis on positioning, planning, and reaction. The game tests your ability to adapt to unfavorable circumstances, and it often pits you against seemingly insurmountable odds in the form of armed thugs.All in all it's great fun. Feels very rewarding when you craft a plan for a particular mission and you pull it off successfully. Would urge you to wait for a sale though, as the base $20 price dropped down to just $4 in this past Autumn Sale.			"

												Simply the best swat tactical game u can ever have played!This game has a iron man mode and for those who dont know what that is it basically means if a person dies in ur team he stays dead forever.U can customize ur swat members which adds a bit more depth to ur squad as u try to keep urself or even ur friends alive XD ur swat members after every campaign and ur swat members WILL DIE sometimes due to bad luck, bad planning etc..BUT ur swat members who died will be replenish with fresh recruits after every campaign. Gameplay....Simply amazing...U will start of as a rookie squad of swat members and u will gradually build them up to higher lvls and u will definitelty want them to come back alive trust me XD and increase ur squads level to unlock 4 classes currently.Which all play out very differently.The assaulter who wields the mg, The shield guy who is basically a meat shield for ur men and the pointmen who are very mobile so that they can get to the hostages fast before they are killed.....After every mission u get rosters which are basically points for u to buy new weapons, armour, gadgets ..etc for ur swat team.Now mods also extend this game's life as modders mod this game with new campaigns and levels which increases the replaypility which is awesome!A must have for hardcore players who love strategy :)			"

								If you're a fan of any of the SWAT games or just like the tactical/spec-ops genre, buy this game. It's simple, yet unforgiving. The Devs constantly add what you would want in a game like this, and with a mission generator, you won't go bored. Defintely worth the money if you can spare it.			"

								A very promising early access game. You control a swat team from a top down perspective, and command them. It plays like an rts but with a pause mechanic, so you can pause the game whenever you want, and take a look at your situation and issue commands. The game really feels complete already, it feels polished and is full of content. If you run out of vanilla content, it has steam workshop as well. Definitely worth the small asking price of $15. If you like forming a complex plan, and then watching it all play out, this is the game for you.			"

												This is honestly one of the most satisfying games I've played, and I honestly feel bad for not having more hours on it in comparison to my thousands on other games. (My problem is that I don't play single player games too extensively at all really...) THIS GAME, is amazing if you like tactical and rewarding engagements that YOU decide who wins not by reflexes, not by superior weaponry most of the time either but by playing, rather out-playing your contestants and manuevering to victory. Yes, this is a ""Police"" game but that's really only in the sense that you save hostages and stuff so most of it is really comparable to military operations in urban terrain which is some of the MOST demanding, tactically speaking, kind of operations. ANGLES are either your friend or your enemy depending on how you work them, teamwork among your units is imperative, and rewarding is it ever when you do a whole mission without losing a teammember or not getting shot due to methodical and tactical commanding on your part it's amazing!! This game is almost comparable to Counter Strike in the tactical sense of needing to use your equipment to gain an advantage over the naturally-advantageous defenders and then capitalize on gains you make into their whatever it may be at the given mission. In other words, this is the only game I've BOTHERED writing a review for so far so you KNOW it's seriously amazing given that right??!!			"

												I bought this thinking it would be similar to Frozen Synapse, but more recent version and a different flavour - police instead of highly abstract. It is similar but not as fun and much more frustrating.The main limitations I found which ruined the game for me were:1) It's very easy to accidentally mis-click and delete your entire plan - with no undo button... To Bad(TM)2) No way to add waypoints in the middle of paths - other than to redo everything3) No way to undo 'look this way' command other than lots of nodes (which isn't really a problem, except...)4) Nodes cannot be moved.I didn't play much because I kept accidentally deleting my plans. But, I did like the door breach methods and the RPG elements (buying weapons, levelling up guys). Never got round to the Campaign, because it's locked behind a level wall - can't play until level 6.I really wanted to like the game, but the utter frustration!!!			"

												The game gets repetitive really quickly. It felt like I was just shoving my team members straight into a meat grinder the entire time and I found it nearly impossible to complete any of the campaigns. There are some serious balancing issues, the game seems to feel and react as if the player is supposed to be a master tactician; every mission feels like you need to play through it until you're sick of it, and then some. I memorized several of the single mission maps just in order to beat them and properly plan everything out. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone that's not a fan of extreme foreplanning and painstaking grinds.			"

												It could be a great wtih a real planning system and AI.The planning is too arcade and confusionary for a real complex strategy; if it were like the first ""Rainbow Six"" series, it would be a 10/10. It's so lame that even the old ""Commandos"" is ten time better than this crappy thing.Also, more important, AI is very dumb. For example, entry men shoots straight to the tangos even with a hostage in between, killing him and making the mission fail stupidly. Or the same mission will end in a success or a fail depending on the mood of your troops: sometimes they see the enemy and shoot at it, other times they are blind and wait silently to be killed.Different weapons have controversial effects: the entry men kills better with a mp5 than a M4, even at long range. The stopping power and the balistics is not even taken in consideration.Enemies are in number of 20, you're in mission in 4, while in real entries attacking troops would be at least the same.I can never imagine how the community can write mostly positive reviews, seriously, you have real issues with tactical games: you accept all the crap that comes to the market only because is happy coloured and runs on iPad.Paid € 2,58 with a coupon, don't spend more on this♥♥♥♥♥♥Uninstalled after 5 hours of game.

												Decent game, but definitely not very tactically deep, and certainly not very fun gameplay-wise. The gameplay itself boils down to mastering a room clearing technique, and once you figure this out, the game becomes very simple. Not much variety in the inventory, and frankly, once you unlock the Assault class, you have everything you need to beat the game outright. The RPG elements that are introduced are very shallow and don't really differentiate your squad members. The various roles in the squad are pretty superfluous, and at later stages, Assault is the only really valuable role you can take. Cover system is very mediocre, with your troops more or less being a gun that you point with your mouse. No dynamic AI, no functional cover shooting. What you have is a game that consists of everything that made the old Rainbow Six games good, but without the same polish that made them fun. Fun diversion for a few hours, but not an 8/10 game.			"

												Despite being a pretty simple game, Door Kickers is extremely well implemented. The gameplay is smooth, challenging and quite exciting once you get going.The system it uses for upgrades is initially a bit frustrating, requiring a bit of grinding to get enough stars to buy decent equipment but once you get past the first hour of gameplay you'll have most of the end-game items you'd want.For once, the single-mission content is larger than the structured story-line missions to the point where I still haven't managed to finish them all yet. The challenges are a bit on the simplistic side though, I'd like to see a wider variety of bonus challenges (like finishing a map using a specific type of trooper, or without firing a shot) but it's hard to complain with something like 100 levels to master.Definitely worth a purchase, and certainly not unfinished content.

												I really wanted to like this game but is horrible, there is no good tutorial to learn the basic mechanics, there are no commands for your troops to advance without shooting, and waipoint to move your troops get stuck all the time with walls or objects. Don't buy it, it's really not worth it, you are going to play four missions and get frustrated by the control system. Besides, the ""campaign"" has no story, its just some missions pulled together.

												Notice how most of the top reviews have under ten hours play time? Yeah. The game wears thin very quickly. Also, the enemies have random spawning on every map. This may sound fine at first, but it's annoying because someimes you do have the perfect plan but RNG desides to screw you. And many times your squad doesn't fire back at enemies and they just stand there to get shot at. It's a very shallow game despite what the tag lines say.			"

												This game is amazing. It's simple, fun, and easy to understand. Sometimes it gets hard but you can always start over. It's easy as in it throws you in there with no tutorial. LOL GOOD LUCK. It's fun to figure it out. The music is nice, the graphics are amazingly well done, and the animation is on point. Lots of tools for people who are really into strategy and also for people like me, lots of tools you can ignore and get the job done, just a bit less efficiently. (Try losing half your team, oops.) There is a lot of content, many missions and maps to play. Overall this game is well worth the 20 bucks. 8/10 P.S. Avast doesn't want anyone to have fun. There is an issue with this game and compatibility with Avast. I contacted their support and got a brief response. ""Hi, It seems AVAST recently started deleting .dll files from our game (even though they're from the known open-source ffmpeg project).You need to pause AVAST, check the game's Steam cache (which will re-download those .dlls) and start the game.If you try running the game with AVAST turned on, it will delete them again, so you need to keep it paused. Unfortunately we don't have a proper solution yet, since it's out of our control, but we're working on it."" Damn you Avast and your anti-Doorkickers campaign. I'll get ALL the viruses just to play this game.			"

												For those of you who enjoyed the planning phase in the original Rainbow 6 games. This is a full game made out of that with a few extra features.For those of you who didn't, its a realtime tactial strategy game, played from a top down perspective where you deal with different situations by commanding your team to breach and clear rooms. kill tangos, and attempt to complete a variety of diffenet objectives and challenges.As you level up you unlock more abilities that improve your team as well as new weapons and equipment. Its very good and I highly recommend it. You can even install a mod that tha changes the sounds effects and music to that of the orginal Rainbow 6 Rogue spear. Sold! "

												I wish there was a way to give a game something in between a thumbs up and a thumbs down. Unfortunately, if I have to choose one, I have to give this game a thumbs down.It's not a bad game. It's just that I've played it before. But the last time I played it it was called Frozen Synapse. And that's the main issue. This game brings nothing at all new or improved to the table. If you've played X-Com or Frozen Synapse or any number of similar games, then you've already played this game.The concept itself is unfortuantely pretty thin. I mean, there's only so many ways you can blow away bad guys in different apartments. It gets repetetive fast, especially if you've already played similar games.			"

												Great real-time-with-pause tactical game. You have a squad of swat operatives and take missions with them to kill baddies, rescue hostages, defuse the bomb. Each mission starts with planning mode, where you can choose weapons and gear for your guys and plan movement and actions for completing objectives. Then you hit big red button and watch. You can pause and change plan any time, and even can play in real time, but this is latter is less effective. After mission you earn stars based on performance which you can use to buy upgrades like new weapons and gear.Highly recommended if you like squad-based tactical games.			"

												This game screams out to fans of Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, and Metal Gear Solid. The planning options in this game are expansive, and offer players an outstanding amount of ways to complete a mission. There is no ""best way"" to finish a mission on this game. Assault classes have the armor to withstand bullets head-on, while stealth units are quick enough to clear rooms of enemies without alerting the rest of the area. This game offers so much in the area of replayability, by allowing users to pick different ways to breach, kill, or arrest.I couldn't recommend this game more if I wanted to, it's just an awesome game that definitely needs a buy if you're a fan of any kind of tactical, stealth simulator.

												You have to pick locked doors before kicking them open, i.e. breaking them to pieces. Oh, and get lost with that crappy dubstep soundtrack.Moreover, have fun elaborating plans for a perfect rating - with RNG.I like the logic of the rating system.""Oh, the mission took you 30 seconds instead of 20? Bad luck, two stars for you.""Next try:""Sir, expendable trooper #2 got badly injured! I don't know if he can ever wield a gun again!""""That doesn't matter, you did it in 19 seconds this time! Perfect, three stars for you!""As much as I like challenges, they somehow have to fit into a game. These ones just break the immersion.Furthermore, the game doesn't really explain anything. The tutorial consists of eight video clips and it only covers the gameplay basics which are basically ""Spacebar to pause, left click to walk and right click for actions.""What about important stuff such as troop management, the ranking system, classes and doctrines? Nah, the complicated stuff you have to figure out yourself.The controls are extremely weird. Without strafing you don't have any chance at all, but sometimes your troopers suddenly stop strafing or they keep strafing when you don't want them to.I guess with a bit of training you get used to them and the game becomes more fun.However, this game threw so much♥♥♥♥♥♥at me in the first hour that I'm not motivated to play any further. I'm just gonna stick to the old Rainbow Six games.			"

												It's a really good tactics game. Pros - Tons of levels.- Tons of armour.- Tons of weapons.- Tons of utilities and support gear.- Voiced characters.- Alternate appearances for characters.- Workshop support.- Level creator.- XP which leads to upgrades.- Allows mission replays so you can see where you went wrong if you died. Cons- Female officers will speak like men. - Can be very difficult during some missions.- Caps aren't available when customizing callsigns OR names.- Steep price tag if it isn't on offer.- REALLY, REALLY fiddly to give your officers directions. 4/5 times you try to flash bang a door, then go through, the UI will just reset and make you redo your plan again. - Some missions are damn near impossible to complete. Fire gun. Oops they heard, hostage is dead. :^) Fire taser. Oops they heard, hostage is dead. :^) Try and stealth it, shoot the bloke who's closest to the ONLY hostage. Oops you failed it.			"

												I bought this minigame on -85% sale for £2.24 and if it was a base price, I would actually recommend this game. very little content highly repeatable missions very little extra equipment: flashbangs grenades door breach charge tazer (useless, you can just catch VIPs as they don't shoot) different items for opening doorsDespite the above, the game is enjoyable. There are some upgrades, skills and unlockable equipment. There are single missions, campaigns, random mission generators.			"

												The general gameplay is nice. If you liked the old Rainbow Six games, where you could plan the mission and then lean back and watch the computer execute it, you're gonna like this game too. Its an easy time killer.However I expierience a lot of bugs, eg: sometimes the plan does not get saved when you fail a mission so hours of planning are gone. Sometimes go codes dont apply anymore. Worst case you have to plan a players path from scratch. Sometimes it is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to select the right player to give him commands. Those kinda things really do mess with the gaming expierence. Also when you want player a and b to push at the same time, but you want just player a to throw a flashbang, player b wont wait for the flashbang, but runs in immediately once the go code was given. thats plenty stupid...Although the game per se is nice for the money, I dont recommend it, until those problems get fixed. Or maybe wait for Door Kickers No. 2			"

												I bought the game on summer sale for a very low price.  Despite this, I'm just under 2 hours and am submitting for refund.At first I thought was a decent pass of time.  But when I got down to actually doing the gold star objectives, I found it incredibly frustrating for a few reasons:-Very often i'll move from point to point with enemies in plain sight and not fire at them-Very often I'll be firing at an enemy but for some reason will disengage and move on to next point regardless of the fact that the not killed enemy is still firing at me-Cannot set rotation points at key spots (like, doors/breaching), which makes the ""Live Play"" or ""Finish in a single set of waypoints"" objectives near impossible without just random dumb luck of the positioning of the enemies upon entering a roomThe randomness of behavior of the enemies is actually a fun point and makes the replays decent, but when your own character seems to be doing things completely counter-intuitive to your purpose (kill enemies in plain sight), it's frustrating and even for the price ($3) I find I've gotten bored of the game quickly in 2 attemps to sit and play it now and I'd rather this money go toward another game.

												This game should be awessome. It's both about action and tactics. Unfortunately it's totally overrun with gamebreaking bugs that makes it almost impossible to play. The biggest irony is that it's called ""doorkickers"" since the doorkicking mechanism contains one of the most severe issues in the entire game: You cannot place yourself in the doorway. By dooing that the dooropening UI hides the UI that allows you to turn in a direction, throw grenades or shoot until there is no threat. Also, backing to the menu does not pause the game, so if there is a tiny flaw in your plan, you want to restart the mission, your entire plan might get eraised. Another thing that drives me crazy is that it impossible to do small changes to your plan. Adjusting it early removes everything after that. So all in all. This game have potential to be extremely good, unfortunately the developers decided to not employ a single tester. It really shows.  "

												Although I was really looking forward to playing this title, I was very disappointed about the gameplay. The tactical side is unplayable in my opinion. XCOM and Breach & Clear are far better titles in that respect. The turn-based tactival gameplay in those games is just superior. In this game it feels clunky, un-fair and completely random. You cannot choose which way your soldiers look, you cannot get them to look around corners and stay in cover that way, the planning is awfull and that just turned me off.I do like the soldier-interface and the levelling aspect of your team's capabilities and weapons, but that just doesn't make up for the clunkiness of the rest of the game.I might just be spoiled by the above mentioned games, which might make this review a bit biased, but as there are alot of positive reviews for this title, I am not very concerned about the impact this review will make.

												Has a lot of potential, but doesn't really deliver. It's a good game, but the leveling system restricting so much strangles the game and holds it short of being a great. Deployments limited to 2 people in the beginning and continue to impliment deployment restrictions in a force:resistance ratio is very restricting and is a real drag as it doesn't focus on strategy as much as bunch up and walk through together as opposed to getting stratigic assault from multiple angles requiring more consideration of strategic locationing. I'm not saying it's a bad game, I am merely stating that I wouldn't recommend it - though it is funny watching people get mad about my review.On the upside, this would be a great game for a modder.I had hoped that people would be smart enough to work it out, but clearly not, so I have edited my review.

												This game looks good, and for the first couple of hours of gameplay I enjoyed it quite a lot.Utlimately it turns out to be a poorly designed and frustrating game. First issue for me, no difficulty levels. We don't all have the same abilities playing this type of game, difficulty levels are a must for me.I just got stuck on the first evidence mission, where, as far as I can determine, it is impossible to get in the front door without alerting the goon sitting next to it. So I played a couple of individual missions to get enough stars to buy a lock pick device. Zero improvement, doesn't work at all.			"

												Amazing game, well worthy of all the praise it gets.The developers are constantly updating, tweaking and adding to the game, and I hear that there is even a multiplayer/co-op mode coming, either for free in a patch, or maybe as paid DLC. Either way, I will take it. These guys deserve every penny.One of the only truly great games to go through early access AND it actually made it to a full release AND it is still supported by the devs now.Very easy to just start playing, it's one of those games that is pretty easy to learn, but difficult to master, especially as the maps go on and get bigger and the enemy get smarter and much much tougher.Workshop support is nice, and there are some truly stunning mods out there, such as the highly rated sound mod that adds almost 100% realistic weapon sounds to every gun in the game, or the many many weapon packs out there that add great weapons from P-90 SMG's to the aliens pulse rifle (ridiculously overpowered, but still good fun).The progression system works nicely, the skill tree is good (although a little small), adding some nice ""abilities"" to your troopers, such as knowing how to use cover better, better aim with pistols or whatever, using double-tap to make sure enemy are put down quickly. All work nicely to bring your officers in line with the rising difficulty as you get to the tougher maps later on.I seriously can't recommend this game enough. Whether you want to plan as you go, pausing every few seconds, or you want to just go it in real time, dragging the path for your troopers and watching them follow as you go, or you (like me) want to plan everything from the beginning, hit the go button and watch your troopers die quickly :) The game allows any one of these methods, or a mix of all at once, planning a mission from start, then pausing and starting a new plan in the middle (because things start to go sideways), and then just keeping it going in real time, moving your troopers around the map to pick off any stragglers and/or moving any hostages to safety that you couldn't see whilst you were originally planning the assault.The game is great, does exactly what it says on the tin, and does it pretty much perfectly in every way.Worth every penny, and the devs definitely deserve their cash, 100%			"

I get that it is a strategy game, but your AI end up doing boneheaded things or reacting in dumb ways to new threats.

Good luck.Your UI is broken, selecting movement types, moving at all, moving waypoints around, removing or placing additional waypoints etc. are all impossible or break the gameplay flow, causing your character to spazz out, having to remake an entire plan from scratch because I misclicked somewhere.This is unjustifyable, for a game that looks like it was made for some game jam, released half a year ago, went through a lengthy early access period, etc. My apologies, but if you can't find the issues yourself with one simple playthrough, don't expect me to report it for you.

Had this been advertised as a military responce game rather than ""in charge of a SWAT team"" it could be evaluated on a different level.

They, even though they shot the guy, have turned just out of sight won't finish them off and get killed. The most frustrating thing is the 90 degree veiw range. Like that's all we have in the world even with a helmet. I don't recommend this game unless they expand the view angle to 120 or 140 degrees.			"

												Not worth the extremely high price.I know this is an early access game, however, so I'll probably change this review later. Right now Doorkickers simply looks promising, and is a few steps away from being amazing.1. No enemy AI. I know the enemies will spawn in different places, helping levels' replayability, but enemy AI would help this out even more.2. Simpler controls. They are already pretty simple for such a deep game, but it would help if there were a better tutorial, to help us know what the ""go codes"" mean, and how to use them etc...3. More content. I feel like there isn't enough content. I don't know what content to add though, so disregard this.

												A solid, fun little game, that suffers from a lack of polish and explanation. Gameplay mechanics are good, and the controls are very simple. They can be picked up very quickly without any kind of tutorial. This is fortunate, since the game does little to explain itself other than a few hints on the controls in the opening missions, and a ""How To"" that says the same information. Unfortunately, any further explanations of game mechanics, controls, or progression are completely missing. For what is a relatively simple game, this shouldn't have been an issue. However, after having to constantly minimize the game to try and search for answers to simple gameplay mechanics, it become frustrating for something that should otherwise be a quick game to play.Although this game doesn't do anything revolutionary, it is solid. If it had more polish, I would most likely recommend it, but there are too many small problems to justify what should be an easy-to-play game.Thanks for reading.			"

There is no satisfaction in completing the levels and leveling up to a level where you actually have decent weapons takes forever. Once again I've played for an hour and a half and I'm barley a high enough to unlock the first real class, the assulter and it frankley sucks. So please don't make the same mistake I made in buying this atrocious game.			"

								Graphics is good, no bugs that I can see. The only gripe I have is that there is no tutorials beyond the basic 3 slides in the game. I know the devt mentioned that there is no point doing a tutorial at this stage, but it does make the game rather steep to learn.But there is nothing more satisfying than to see your planned mission go off smoothly once you figured out the basics.I do wish that the characters would not moving into the room before the flashbang go off though...And the stopping the hostage execution scenarios are hair-pulling exercises.Better than Frozen Synapse in that the graphics are more engaging, and keeps me interested during the mission, and the pause-anytime-to-plan feature is fantastic.Looking forward to more improvements by the devts!

								Based on the 21 June 14 Beta:I watched a Nerdcubed Alpha Detective on Youtube for this and it looked fun. Only had a small discount in the Summer Sale, but got it anyway. So glad I did.Massively addictive game and has that ""one more go"" feel. Just playing through the single missions trying to 3 star them all. Has that X-com trait of being protective of your leveled up guys. Only criticism so far is that the guns seem too similar. There are 7 or 8 hand guns and the best one is easy to unlock so its pointless to even bother with the ones in between. The better Assault rifles have a better leveling up/unlocking range.  Don't normally bother with game editors, but going to try on this - seems easy to use from the little play I had.  "

												So, you're probably sitting here thinking, ""Why don't I just get Breach and Clear?"". Here are a few reasons why this game is AWESOME! I got Door Kickers in the autumn sales for £2 (I'm a sucker for a bargain) already I have put 4.1 hours into the game just by playing before and after school before dinner. This game is amazing!The sheer brilliance of the customisation means you can have all kinds of you own ""classes"" on top of the pre-made ones! For example, I created a line up of solely pointmen with silenced pistols and took out the targets with stealth and cunning rather than brute force. It was cool to think I could do all of these new cool tactics!Now, I'm not one to go through a game and get three stars on every level. I just get bored. But for Door Kickers? The fact that you need stars to customise your squad means I want to 100% the game!Also, another great thing is that the most expensive gun/armour/shield isn't nessecarily the best gun/armour/shield! It's all about how you play the game! You can also upgrade the weapon skills of your squad with pistols, long guns and shotguns! This adds a whole other dynamic to the game as you can upgrade your perks or equipment strategically depending on one other!And of course you can name each member squad! You can be as creative as you like! You could call your ""crack-shot-with-a-pistol-guy"" anything from ""Dead-eye"" to ""Sh**head"" This enables you to be slightly attached to your men and be upset if they are killed in the line of fire. And yes, if your men are killed during a campaign, they will not be replaced by new men until you have won/lost the whole campaign! This makes you think about your choices more carefully during an assault on a building.I would highly recommend this game to ANYONE no matter what games they like/play! I recommend picking it up, especially in a sale! Worth the £14.99 its sold for! "

												I got this because I love turn-based combat and games like Frozen Synapse bring me great enjoyment. I was not disappointed. The customisation for your squad is pretty good (though I'm unclear what some stats even do), the strategy is fairly deep without being overwhelming, and unlike other games of the genre, it can actually be advantageous to play in ""real time"" sometimes.There were a couple of minor annoyances for me, like some doorways creating dead angles where the AI can shoot at me but I can't shoot back, even though the two guys are actually touching guns (giggity), using stairways is ""fiddly"" at best, and some mechanics are frustrating because they're never really explained anywhere (like gun handling when passing corners, body-blocking, etc). I also kinda miss being able to crouch, but that's a minor nitpick.All in all: super fun, very addictive gameplay, would recommend any day of the week.			"

Doorkickers lets me feel that satisfaction again with some very addicting gameplay, customiable usits, ramdomized enemies and  more replayability than you can imagine.			"

								One of the best things I've played recently. Squad tactics feels quite realistic, really nice graphics - and tons of fun. I really recommend if anyone likes this genre. On a bonus note - my computer science master's thesis was about CQB AI and squad tactics - but it was waaaay less complicated and thorough. If Door Kickers were around at that time I would probably be failed for a lame project ;) Keep up the good work guys!			"

								If you like strategy you should play this. Some of it relies on how the bad guys act, but if you're careful enough you shouldn't lose too many men. Arts fine, sounds good. The workshop is active for it and make good content. I happen to like the Assualt class and the Pointman class. And it's only in Early Access right now but it's great! Buy this, you'll probably enjoy it.			"

								Door Kickers is only in an Alpha state right now (version 7 to be exact as I write this), but the game is wonderful. It is one part top-down shooter and 9 parts Rainbow Six with regards to tactics. While the premise is simple, the various maps and the potential for community interaction and future custom maps is astounding. The game is ridiculously addicting and can only get better from here. Do not hesitate to hit the ""buy"" button on this one. Do it, you know you want to.			"

								This is buy far the BEST tactical simulators I have played since 1998 with the release of the first rainbow six. Every aspect of the game is, fluid and smoth. Delivering a marvelous feeling of being right there on the ground when the first door charge goes off, all this despite it being a 2D top down view.When I play it in genarall goes like this.1. Get the lay of the land, (Evaluate points of entry, danger zones, decide distrubation of the squad)2. How to go about it, (Plan paths of moment, cover zones, assert pace requierd to meet the time limits)3. Taking a closer look, (Get eyes inside of target building or area, reasses previous planing on the new info)4. Kicking down the door, (Executing previous planing)Step 1-3 takes between 1-5 minutes unless im picky and decides to plan it all down to the tinyest detail,Step 4 goes in about 10 seconds up to a minute. 5. Improvising in 9/10 times the planing can't cover every base so I generaly have to cut in half way or in the first 3 seconds of the execution and re plan from there whit what I have to work with.It is wonderfull to get a perfect run whitout hicups in the plan but its just as thrilling to be able to salvage a ""crashed and burned"" plan to still be able to execute the rest.There is a lot of games out there that is worth playing only once, Door kickers is NOT among those titles.You can play it over and over and OVER again, succeding and learning failing and learning. Every time it is a brand new game. If you are a fan of tacsim like me you will get hooked.Score 10/10			"

												Sure, a good defense is a good offense, but Coach, are we the Xs or are we the Os?This is the finest pause-and-plan-as-you-go real-time strategy playpen since Fallout Tactics--equal parts Rainbow Six, Hotline Miami, and Faster Than Light. You can obsessively map out elaborate crackdowns in drug dens and beachside cartel parties at mission start and watch them crackle, bang, and fail hilariously like some kind of funky Sea Monkey tank full of hypermurder in the name of justice or plain old police-state brutality. Its meticulous design and indelible difficulty make for a satisfying and addictive top-down puzzle-shooter, even if a few suriving strategy-imploding bugs add an element of chaos that render it better resembling that pachinko ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

												This is one of the best turn based strategy planning games I have played in a long while. While Frozen Synapse is excellent, and Breach and Clear is brilliant, they're not as much fun (FS), or quite as polished (B&C) as this.This is so much fun. I haven't been able to put it down for a while, and that's saying something, as I just bought The Witcher 3.There is no story, but for what this game is, the strategy element is so clever, and fun. It just keeps getting better and better, with more and more options; and a fantastic skill tree that makes a real difference to the gameplay.For me, this is a 9/10.			"

This game forces you to try new strategys in order to become better and faster to complete even tougher street battles and CQB kill houses. P.S: I even made the legendary two soldiers.

												Well, I took a chance on a cheap game that had some postitive reviews.  I am glad I did, this game is great, I cant stop playing.  Even when I die over and over, I dont get upset.  I just change my tactics.  I would call this a cross between X-Com, Frozen Synapse and Swat.  You can play in real time, but it is better to stop the action and make your moves first.One thing I really like are the go codes, you can make a swat member approch each door on each side of room the exact same time.  And then you blow it open or kick it in, the terrorist are confused and it is easy to take them out.  I really reccomend this game, I understand you can also play on IOS as well.  But I think that would not be as good as using a mouse and PC.  Get it for PC.   Check out all the positive reviews, there is a reason.			"

												More ""Rainbow Six"" than Vegas and Vegas 2...and I'm pretty sure Siege as well. Doorkickers is a real-time/turn-based tactical strategy game where you can do all of the planning you loved in R6 1-3. Great mechanics, good interface, good graphics, plenty of loadout options..everything is pretty much top-notch perfection. The game DOES have its own identity, but for now, it's as close to a good R6 installment as you're going to get. The only improvements I can think of are adding a great multiplayer mode, and being able to control operatives directly, but, this isn't Rainbow Six, this is Doorkickers. Buy it, play it, love it. 10/10			"

												TL;DR6.5/10Don’t go out of your way to recommend it, but if you find the chance, then go for itI first saw this game while searching through the deep dark slums of the farthest-back pages of Steam, and was not immediately encouraged to get Door Kickers. It just looked like a bare-bones, top-down shooter with some mediocre ‘tactical’ elements tossed in. I let it be for a while and then came back to it a couple of months later, then decided “what the heck, I’ll buy it”. I had a total blast for the first week, just playing my way through various missions and unlocking various weapons and armor, but after that, I found myself getting really bored. That is, until I discovered the workshop, and let me tell you; that is what makes this game so great.Gameplay wise, Door Kickers really stands out. None of your soldiers are too overpowered (unless you download god armor from the workshop), so you need to use every last drop of tactical knowledge to keep them alive. Nothing is more frustrating then spending twenty minutes working out a plan and then having all of your troops mowed down by some guy with a machine gun hiding behind a bulletproof couch the instance they kick down the first door. To actually complete a mission you need to buckle down and focus, or you are going to end up with only one guy, cowering in the corner, waiting for someone to come and yell a stereotypical phrase at them then blow your final guy’s head off.All in all, Door Kickers won’t blow you away, but if you like tactical games, then you’ll have some fun with it. If you don’t like those games, then this is probably not the game for you. The graphics aren’t great, but the workshop makes up for that by having new stuff constantly made every day for you to try out. So give it a try if you feel like it, but if you don’t like this type of game, then don’t waste your money on it.6.5/10Don’t go out of your way to recommend it to a friend, but if you find the chance, then go for itBuy it full price if you have the money on hand, but otherwise buy it on sale.~Mfilms2000You can find more of our reviews on our curator page here:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/technosharkreviews "

												A game for tacticians who like their challenges realistic and their options almost infinite.  Every door is a problem to be solved - kick it in? place guys on both sides and open it? breach it? toss flashbangs through? try to go in quiet with silencers? jump in with quick reacting pistol wielders? cautiously have the guy with the shield lead the way? jump in with assault rifles and try to overwhelm with sheer force? Switch out the guns to maximize fire rate or accuracy or stopping power? How many people to assign to the door? Do you leave yourself open to being flanked if you stack people on a door? This game is exactly what I want out of tactical strategy.			"

												You wanna be a hero? Be a hero for a couple seconds and die! You wanna be tactical? Flashbang and then die. You wanna teamwork? Flashbang, have the shields go first, then send in the assault team, unless is CQC, then send in the breachers, maybe a few more flashbangs, bum rush to the hostages if they're about to be killed with the shields in front of you, as the assault/breachers cover your back, and this time have the breachers shoot down the door, as the assault team (or person if you have a 4 guy squad with 2 shields, a assaulter and a breacher) to take down the enemy. Next (again with the shields in front) find a hallway, and put the shields in front of you, having them slowly advance as you check from door to door. Then, if you don't wanna play the full mission, find a hostage and run for your life! (with the shields behind you). You wanna be a traitor? Well...This is how I would best describe this game. As IGN would put it: ""Tactical games at its best.""As I would put it, ""WHO CARES! FLASHBANG THE CRAP OUTTA THE GUYS AND BUMRUSH THEM! Wait... those are the guys reading my review...?""			"

												Easily one of the best games on the market of its kind.  Unilke almost every other ""tactical strategy"" is turn-based.  Ace Patrol did manage to pull that off, but RTS is always more fun in my opinion.  The brutal realism, and not to mention the various blood settings are very well done.  So far it has been bug-free in my experience, and its setting is very unique.			"

												Surprising amount of depth for a 2D top-down title. Didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did but they pretty much did everything right and exceeded all expectations looking at this from previews and gameplay. Entering  each zone is tense and requires a lot of planning and decisions to be made in squad placement, individual loadouts, and directions of approach. Unlocking weapons, skills, and soldier perma-death make for a great progression system. Tacking on the community made maps and mods increases the replayability value on top of the game. Incredibly well-balanced in weapons, armor, and classes with the enemies. It's like Hotline Miami with more tacticality and depth. Would recommend to anyone with a slight passing interest in the game.			"

												What can I say? I was in love with the first Rainbow Six games, where we had tactics mixed with FPS. And I was disappointed when the brand followed the FPS-only road. Luckily, today, we have Door Kickers.Even tough it hasn't got the FPS part, DoorKickers allow you to plan a police operation and play along. But beware! The price of this game is worthy only if you are not a whiner. It is extremely hard to get all stars in many missions. There are only few that can be considered easy. It is a great challenge.In game bugs? At first I was annoyed that sometime, one of my police officers threw a grenade or flashbang at their feet (hitting the wall instead of throwing it past the wall) but later I started considering that everyone is human. Everyone makes mistakes, police officers too. And this makes everything more challenging.			"

Recommended but needs work.Door Kickers is a fun, simple game of strategy and planning. You get the layout of the house you're assaulting, plan each troopers' route, including throwing flashbangs, securing evidence and breaching doors, then hit Action, and watch as your plan unfolds. It is extremely satisfying to watch your plan be executed perfectly.There are a few things that need to be worked out, however. Planning a trooper's movement requires the use of waypoints, where you order the trooper to look a certain direction, open a door, or use one of their gadgets. Once you've placed a waypoint and moved on to the next one, you are limited in your editing abilities. You can either delete the waypoint or change the action, but you cannot move the waypoint. Also, if you delete one waypoint, it will delete all proceeding waypoints as well. So if you make a mistake early on, your whole route has to be redone. This makes editing the route very difficult and time consuming. Currently, you cannot export a replay on Mac.			"

												Door kicker is an awesome and addict game. I higly recommend it to everyone. The game is well balanced, easy to play, and very nicely done.There are things however that could be improved. The characters may ""improve"" in the game but it actually has not much impact. The same applies to weapons, there are lots of weapons which have almost the same statistics, so they don't make much difference. It would be nice to be able to add more customization to weapons, like lamp, laser dot, etc.  So, overall, a great-great game, and i hope there will be a Door Kickers 2 with more improvements.			"

												Excellent, excellent game- the kind of game where you have been playing it and look at the clock and see ""Oh, it's bedtime... I will just play one more scenario""- and then three hours later you are like ""OMG I gotta work tomorrow!""The music fits perfectly and is awesome (I could just let it play in the background all day), scenarios are quick and replayable.  I have only just begun the content and I feel like I can't get enough of it!  The graphics style and point of view is refreshing.If you don't like a lot of blood I guess that might be a negative point, but I highly recommend this game if you like planning and strategy type games with customization options for your squad members, skill trees, equipment changes... none of these look too overblown but there is just a light enough touch of them to keep it interesting.Waited for this to be on sale but in retrospect, would have paid full price.

												Good old Rainbow Six is back. Only this time without the FPS part.The game is very simple to get into and controls are easy. Music and sounds get you pumped up as you spend your time planning your mission. Positives: Action packed tactic and puzzle missions, unlocks to be had, team progression, kit selections, moddable on top of all the content and missions which the game already has. Negatives: Needs more background sounds, I'm tired of hearing Bush speak. Missions and campaigns have a too big difference in awards. Would be nice with hotkeys for ALL commands (switching to secondary, planting breach, flashbang). Thanks to Lirik from Twitch for showing this game.			"

												Mixed feelings about it so far. I put 3 of my men to face one door. The criminal comes out of the door and guns down two of my men with a machine gun before he gets taken down. I almost uninstalled the game then and there. AI seem to have problems, like instead of throwing a flash grenade into the doorway they will throw it at the wall in front of them bouncing back in their face.The replayability is good with random mission generation and a map maker..I like how when you are in a campaign, if your men get injured they stay injured for a while but if you get out of the campaign and go a random mission, it passes the time so that when you go back into campaign, your men are healed up. The action is fluid and the gaining of experience is not restricted to one specific game type. Also it is still the only thing today that reminds me of the good old Rainbow Six and GRAW. In fact there is a mod that just makes it straight Rainbow Six.			"

												Door kickers is a fantastic top down shooter, but not quite like every other one.What sets door kickers apart is its almost 'blueprint' type of plan and play. The base of the game is you have a squad of customizable soldiers that you must guide through a small area in a strategic way while taking as few casualties as possible and comleting the objective. The objectives range from anything from saving hostages, to disarming bombs, to simply killing every enemy and more.How to command each soldier is relatively simple, click and drag a path for them to follow. If you want to get fancy you can even right click and drag an arrow to where you want them to look at different points on the path making for effective straffing manuvers. You must plan your path carefully because you are not given the location of your enemies and therefore it pays to be strategic. If you do futz it up, there is a pause button that you can activate anytime durring the mission and replan your squads next move.Obtaining new equipment for your soldiers is like other games with a progression system. as you progress you get points to spend on new equipment such as heavier bullet-proof vests, new weapons, riot shields, etc. Although the customization may make the game seem unfair and favor you, it counters that by giving you a ton of enemies or the satisfaction of knowing that you planned just right. For example, if there's a room of 10 enemy soldiers right in front of you and you only have 4 guys, you're not going to send them all in with ligh armour and tiny pistols. What you can do is customize your squad to have heavy armour, have 2 swap out their primary weapons for riot shields, and the others to carry assault riffles and stack up on each other providing heavy fire and protection in the trade off for mobility and a quick trigger finger. It's these trade offs that make the difference in how you plan and make the strategic aspect of the game very inportant.There is also a skill tree menu for your soldiers. Along with unlocking new equipment you can 'train' your team to give them boosts such as aiming faster, more accurately, following up with a second shot to make sure the enemy is dead, hold their fire for those who like to be stealthy, and so on and so forth.The game also has a number of little things it will throw in from time to time to help it feel a little more 'real'. This includes an uncertain amount of baddies on many levels, 'cause who knows if they called for back up of not? You occasionally get a sniper friend to help you because back up never hurt you either (in fact, it seems a little overpowered, but I'm not complaining). Your soldiers CAN die! After all those missions you go through together, all the promotions they've earned, all the gear you've given them, and they just one day *pew pew* and you just have to sit there for a minute wondering why you were so foolish and sent your commerade out into a blaze of fire and know you lost the best soldier on your team *sniffle sniffle*. (Quietly whispers) ""He was so young..."" Ok, now back to what I was saying. You must also tell your crew to reload because contrary to many games, you don't just majically know when to reload, you first have to walk into enemy fire, pull the trigger, realize you're out of ammo, and get shot in the midst of reloading because you forgot to tell your poor soldier to reload. This isn't to forget that there is a cover system in the game. If you can pull out and behind a barrel to give yourself adequate cover for a moment, it could really save you in a pinch, and if you're like me, give an oppertunity to reload. Before I get too far off topic I should mention that you do gain new soldiers back ofter a few missions, they may grow on trees in this game, but that doesn't mean it's an instant replacement.Door Kickers also assists you by adding stealth mechanics also (but let's be honest, guns aren't the quietest things).The line of sight really is your best friend in this game because as long as you can intrude it by hiding behind a door or something (Are you happy now? I mentioned doors just like you were waiting for), you can use this to help get into a good spot to take down the enemy from all sides, or over all to your advantage depending on the plan. In adition to the line of sight, you should also try to be relatively quiet unless you bring out the big guns. This is thanks to a small sound system they threw in so you can't simply blow up doors and have ever enemy go ""Hey, you hear something?"" and the other guy say ""Nah, it's probably just the wind"" *cough* skyrim *cough*.Now although It's easy to slip up (like me) and forget to reload (like me) and get your people killed (like me), your not completely hopeless. The fix to being an idiot (guess like who? yup, like me) is to add a somewhat self sufficent AI, so if your soldier runs into a tough spot or gets shot by someone out of their line of sight, they can do things like turn to them and shoot them, or if they're heavily armoured and can take a few hits to buy some time before dying and their clip ran out, they will try to reload it. Although it may not seem like it, this small bit of AI that can help take care of little things can really help win a mission.Now, finally you say, ""Okay, I beat the game, what now?"" Well, the good people that made this game thought of that and have little side objectives such as complete a level without causualties ot in a certain time frame or something to help add some play time. When you finish with that there's even more. They even threw in a random map generator to add even more hours of play. You just have to put in what you want, things such as: nuber of enemies, map size, if you want fog of war, etc. and out pops a map for you. Pretty nice, huh?Given that the game is called Door Kickers, you may be reading this and say ""Hey, what's with the lack of busting down doors?"" and so this goes out to you. You can:-pick the lock-use a crowbar-C4-Blast if open with a shot gun-open it and chuck a grenade through-make a sound to lure the baddies and have them open it for you-whatever else you can think of doing, you got options, be creative and knock yourself out.Rating: 9/10Very solid experience in my time, try not to run directly into a house full of enemies and you should be pretty set. The progression system isn't a favorite of mine and the line of sight can be weird sometimes, but hey, it's not half bad.			"

												I have been a fan of this game ever since I tried the first Alphas that came online on steam. Coming from a tactical shooting background, I really find this game to be not only fun and challenging, but also instructive. Having the generator for creation of random maps, and the editor, makes it a great game and a great instructive tool. I am a devoted fan.			"

As I was typing this I thought ""I wonder how much I have actually played this?"" and the answer is 25 hours. I think this game can go on forever. Strongly recommended and if it isn't on sale you will not regret paying full price because of the amount of gameplay here and the fact that most of the game can be open to you isntantly.			"

												Door Kickers is an amazing game which is definetely worth the price, but does have a few bugs, which is expected.First of all, the gameplay in general, and the way you control the S.W.A.T. team is very well done in my opinion. It's fairly simple to map out plans and create strategies for completing missions, while also allowing a variety of different actions. The weapon variety is plentiful, but there should be more interesting gadgets to use. There are lots of levels, and different campaigns to go through which should keep you busy for a while. New ones are being made all the time too. Also, the animations look fluid.DESPITE THIS there are some ♥♥♥♥ing annoying things that NEED to be fixed.One thing I hate is that your men can be real dumbasses sometimes. Often, if there is an enemy behind two guys, and he kills one of them, the other guy, whose buddy JUST DIED right next to him, won't even turn around to engage the enemy, even if that enemy doesn't move or even just stays and reloads! You have to manually turn him around, which can get very annoying and often results in another dead trooper. This doesn't always happen, but it needs to be fixed. Another small thing is that the female SWAT members have male voices.Overall, I recommend the game. Soon this will be fixed and the game will be perfect			"

												A tactical game where you take control of a swat team that you can customize with dozens of guns and items. As far as guns go, there are pretty much 4 types, and there's no real incentive to use anything other than the best gun of each type: either the best SMG for close quarters, the best shotgun, the best rifle, or the best silenced weapon. Pistols behave similarly. However, the core strategy experience is deep and addicting. The tutorial is really insufficient to acquaint you with new features of the game, as I was still discovering ""advanced"" controls after 10+ hours.That said, holy fudge, this game is tons of fun. As you start to master the controls, the rush and satisfaction of breaching a door, placing a few well placed bullets into the generic ""terrorists"", and saving the hostages, you'll forget all about any problems. Plus, the game itself comes with a robust level editor, and custom content is worth the price of admission on its own. The game comes (right now) with 120+ individual missions and 6 campaigns. It's a lot of content, and with about 20 hours logged I'm done with the 4 shortest campaigns, and a mere <30 missions. I've unlocked everything except the clearly worse guns, but I'm still playing like there's more to unlock- the game is just that fun.If you like strategy games or are looking for a unique SWAT type sim, listen to the hype- this game is GREAT.

												I have to admit, I didn't expect much from the top down shooter but man was I wrong.  Once you learn the basics of technique it really is addicting to master the seemingly unlimited map scenarios.  For anyone who enjoys the rainbow six series (especially the older and more detailed planning versions) you will enjoy this game.  The controls are straight forward, plan a route and find the best way to clear the various rooms.  I found myself restarting the challenges over until I attained 3 stars a piece.  I am 5 hours into the single mission maps and have noet yet began any of the campaigns.  only downside to the game from what I have read, is that when a character dies, the player is gone forever.  That is unless you do some scum saving.			"

												Well, I took a chance on a cheap game that had some postitive reviews.  I am glad I did, this game is great, I cant stop playing.  Even when I die over and over, I dont get upset.  I just change my tactics.  I would call this a cross between X-Com, Frozen Synapse and Swat.  You can play in real time, but it is better to stop the action and make your moves first.One thing I really like are the go codes, you can make a swat member approch each door on each side of room the exact same time.  And then you blow it open or kick it in, the terrorist are confused and it is easy to take them out.  I really reccomend this game, I understand you can also play on IOS as well.  But I think that would not be as good as using a mouse and PC.  Get it for PC.   Check out all the positive reviews, there is a reason.			"

												Doorkickers. The name says it all. If you like strategy (or just going on to workshop and finding the most ridiculous thing for your SWAT team to use) then this is the game for you. You kick down the door, shoot people, and that's pretty much it. You can either play it as you go or plan it out right from the start. The game is really optomized to let you time things perfectly, and things that are a little iffy you can easily fix with a couple of workshop mods. It's 50% off when I'm writing this and I think even at its full $20 price its worth a look at.			"

												I played this game and enjoyed it.If you liked the old SWAT tactical shooter, here's something you will enjoy. The good thing about this is that there's actual planning invovled - ypou don't just send your men in guns blazing, cause that way most or all of them will go back in bodybags. Here you have to plan ahead and every room you clear matters. One unexpected event will often demand of you to re-think your strategy. This is NOT a game wher eyou plan, then hit ""execute"" and forget about the whole thing. Far from what it may seem from screenshots or short videos, this is a thinking man's game.Another good part of it is that there's more replayability than meets the eye. The same scenario will vary from one playthrough to the next. You may encounter different number of foes, in diffrent places, with different behaviour, armament and patrol patterns than you seen in your last playthrough of a given scenario. There are a lot of scenarios on tp of it all.There is also an RPG-style mechanic - your SWAT agents will rise in skill after participating in missions, you will also get access to more armor types, weapon and doctrines as you complete more missions. Doctrines act much as passive bonuses in mmorpgs. This works pretty well, although it is primarily a tactical game and the rpg elements are not as deep as in complex mmos.Only two downsides I can think of are two elements from the SWAT games taht I miss here - there's no tear gas and there's little in the way of opponent morale - 99% of foes will fight to the death and not surrender.

												What can I say? I was in love with the first Rainbow Six games, where we had tactics mixed with FPS. And I was disappointed when the brand followed the FPS-only road. Luckily, today, we have Door Kickers.Even tough it hasn't got the FPS part, DoorKickers allow you to plan a police operation and play along. But beware! The price of this game is worthy only if you are not a whiner. It is extremely hard to get all stars in many missions. There are only few that can be considered easy. It is a great challenge.In game bugs? At first I was annoyed that sometime, one of my police officers threw a grenade or flashbang at their feet (hitting the wall instead of throwing it past the wall) but later I started considering that everyone is human. Everyone makes mistakes, police officers too. And this makes everything more challenging.			"

												Very nice and rich tactical squad game ! You will take control of a SWAT team and have save hostages, difuse bombs or kill ennemies in close quarter environment. The gameplay is very rich and efficient. You will have a lot of fun at playing it. This is more than a die and rety simply,This game will ask you to recognize tactics and planning of the assault. You can assign different teamroles to the unit like assault, breacher, shield... and choose your gear (rifles, guns, equipments) The longevity is big with plenty of different missions with ennemies locations changing each time. This is a very good bought I've done and for the prce you can not regret it. In this style I do not know better game ! Ce jeu est une super pioche. Le contrôle d'une escouade SWAT dans les environnements urbains vous demandera, voire exigera, de la planification et du bon sens dans l'assaut. Les scénarii et missions sont très nombreux et le gameplay très intéressant bien que simple. Vraiment je ne regrette pas cet achat. Super dans le genre tactique/stratégie !			"

												Every now and then, a game comes along and fills a gap in the market that I didn't really know needed to be filled - Door Kickers is one such game. Inspired in no small part by the planning phases of late 1990s Tom Clancy games, Door Kickers is a thought provoking adrenaline rush of anti-terrorism action-puzzles. There's two ways you can play Door Kickers. You can either take advantage of the ability to pause & issue commands in real time, edging your way through a level one command at a time, carefully assessing your options before pushing onwards... Then there's the right way - You plan everything from the get go. One continuous stream of commands that'll see your trooper(s) go from room to room, checking their corners and, hopefully, never leaving themselves open to an ambush. The sense of accomplishment from laying down a perfect plan that requires no tweaking after the mission starts is pretty special, and adds so much challenge to the game that you'll be entertained for hours and hours.Levels vary wildly from simple elimination jobs, to bomb defusal, hostage rescue, and evidence gathering. No two levels are the same, and thanks to the numerous ways to approach each, there's potentially no limit to replayability. Replayability is also helped by a multi-tier challenge system & a pretty strong community modding scene. The in-game custom level generator makes designing & sharing levels with others really simple, and it's fun to see how challenging a level can actually be when designed by someone other than a sensible developer.Character variety is a-plenty as the game has a generous amount of specialized classes & customization, along with veterancy rewards and dedicated fighting styles. Completing campaign levels in the best possible way will require a well rounded squad of multiple talents, but be warned - Death is permanent in campaign modes, and it's possible to lose a talented officer in just one poor move.It's not all great, though. Music & voice acting is less than mediocre, while the graphics are pretty much just fit for purpose. There could also be very slight improvements to mission planning, but the developers have proven their intent to better the game, and it's by no means bad right now - It just could be a little better, that's all.Overall, Door Kickers is a resounding recommendation. A collection of standalone tactical puzzles, campaigns & UGC, all wrapped in an attractive enough package with amazing character customization & challenges galore. If you're in any way  intrigued, then jump in without hesitation.			"

												A real-time with pause game that requires you to plan carefully before engaging the bad guys. The squad as a whole could level up, earning you 'doctrines' to spend on the provided tech tree. Each squad member could also level up to improve their stats. You gain 'stars' after each successful mission, which you can spend on unlocking new weapons/armors/items that you can assign to any squad member. You could play the built-in missions, generate random ones, or create your own with the editor.So, yes, the game is worth every penny.			"

												One of the best Tactical games I have ever played hands down.  Similar to Frozen Synapse that came out a few years ago but in all ways superior to it.  The ease of giving units direction and the ability to pause or command your units in real time make this game so fun.  It's also challenging, there are times to beat for each mission and you have to pass levels with one gameplan you create to have your units move in fluidly and dispatch all targets.  It is really fun to set up part of the plan, hit play, see how it pans out and then edit it accordingly and add on the next steps.I can'trecommend this game enough to people who like tactical games.

Early Access Review
								Amazing game, although rough around the edges. Features an in game editor allowing for some interesting things. The Devs have been great since beginning and even take criticsm very openly. 10/10 for a pre-release, Beta. Can't wait for GOLD.Alright Time for an update. Door Kickers has only gotten better over the past few months since its final release. The dev tem has been AMAZING!!!! Everytime I would tell them something via email, the issue would seem to be fixed very soon after. The workshop integration has proved to provided limitless opportunities for new weapons, maps and more. Not only is the community very active with mods, the devs are constantly adding things into the game.  10/10 best game 2014. The price is a steal. Enjoy.			"

												This game has some of the highest replayability ive ever seen. It has several campaigns, tons of challenge levels, level editor, steam workshop support where you can get even more levels, and a random level generator. You can literally play an infinite amount of different levels of differing complexity. It ticks all the right boxes. The only game I can think of that you can loosely compare it to would be hotline miami in that its a top down room clearing shooter but thats where the similarity ends. Door kickers lets you pause and start the gameplay at will to change your plan for your team on the fly to account for dynamically changing enemy positions. This is a god send for those who dont want to meticulously plan out an entire mission from the very beginning and will keep you on your toes. There are so may more things i could write but im too lazy and i dont want to. Just get this game! Its rated 97% positive for a reason.			"

												Door Kickers is an absolutley fantastic top-down tactical shooter, the game is designed to really make you think about the classes you choose and the way you go about things, for example, it's entirely possible for me to have four guys bust through the front door and have them be killed to the last man in 2 seconds flat, on the other hand I can send one guy with some good armor and well placed flashbangs quietly through the back or a window and get a fair way through the stage without even getting hit. There's also a great deal of customization for each character's weapons, armor, and utilities. This allows for a level of mission specific customization that further enhances the experience. The only thing I'd say I didn't like is that at times if caught reloading or lockpicking the interrupt is too long, the character doesn't move at all which usually results in an insta-kill.			"

												Mixed feelings about it so far. I put 3 of my men to face one door. The criminal comes out of the door and guns down two of my men with a machine gun before he gets taken down. I almost uninstalled the game then and there. AI seem to have problems, like instead of throwing a flash grenade into the doorway they will throw it at the wall in front of them bouncing back in their face.The replayability is good with random mission generation and a map maker..I like how when you are in a campaign, if your men get injured they stay injured for a while but if you get out of the campaign and go a random mission, it passes the time so that when you go back into campaign, your men are healed up. The action is fluid and the gaining of experience is not restricted to one specific game type. Also it is still the only thing today that reminds me of the good old Rainbow Six and GRAW. In fact there is a mod that just makes it straight Rainbow Six.			"

This game is really cool and for 14 dollars there really isnt much to complain about.

												I love this game. It had me at ""Tango Down!"".It has yet to crash on me. Entertains for hours. I have completed the first two campaigns, and working on the third, along with going for all the stars and achievements on the first several screens of maps. I dislike how spy cameras work in planning a breech as you can't have them do it, then switch to another method of breech, or sweep the room then kick the door, which results in pausing, dinking with the plan. I also can't seam to figure out how to add movement waypoints in the middle of an existing way point.  Stealth guys are a little quirky, they need to have the ability to shoot regardless or stay silent, not just a button mash while executing a plan. I like how the dev's kept it real, no crazy sci fi or uber expensive tech gear. That might be a cool expansion a future cop or such. I could also see this being a fun military sim, clearing a city block or such. Overall this game provides plenty of fun for the cost.			"

												Surprising amount of depth for a 2D top-down title. Didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did but they pretty much did everything right and exceeded all expectations looking at this from previews and gameplay. Entering  each zone is tense and requires a lot of planning and decisions to be made in squad placement, individual loadouts, and directions of approach. Unlocking weapons, skills, and soldier perma-death make for a great progression system. Tacking on the community made maps and mods increases the replayability value on top of the game. Incredibly well-balanced in weapons, armor, and classes with the enemies. It's like Hotline Miami with more tacticality and depth. Would recommend to anyone with a slight passing interest in the game.			"

Switch out the guns to maximize fire rate or accuracy or stopping power? How many people to assign to the door? Do you leave yourself open to being flanked if you stack people on a door?

Theres so many possible strategys to go through, a ton of missions, mission genorator for endless random maps to play on. Tons of wepons to use tacticly, go light, go heavy, go in silent, bring a shield whatver you feel like is the best strategy. The endless hours of entertainment and joy of controling all ur little minions on the screen fullfill your genous plan.			"

												TL;DR6.5/10Don’t go out of your way to recommend it, but if you find the chance, then go for itI first saw this game while searching through the deep dark slums of the farthest-back pages of Steam, and was not immediately encouraged to get Door Kickers. It just looked like a bare-bones, top-down shooter with some mediocre ‘tactical’ elements tossed in. I let it be for a while and then came back to it a couple of months later, then decided “what the heck, I’ll buy it”. I had a total blast for the first week, just playing my way through various missions and unlocking various weapons and armor, but after that, I found myself getting really bored. That is, until I discovered the workshop, and let me tell you; that is what makes this game so great.Gameplay wise, Door Kickers really stands out. None of your soldiers are too overpowered (unless you download god armor from the workshop), so you need to use every last drop of tactical knowledge to keep them alive. Nothing is more frustrating then spending twenty minutes working out a plan and then having all of your troops mowed down by some guy with a machine gun hiding behind a bulletproof couch the instance they kick down the first door. To actually complete a mission you need to buckle down and focus, or you are going to end up with only one guy, cowering in the corner, waiting for someone to come and yell a stereotypical phrase at them then blow your final guy’s head off.All in all, Door Kickers won’t blow you away, but if you like tactical games, then you’ll have some fun with it. If you don’t like those games, then this is probably not the game for you. The graphics aren’t great, but the workshop makes up for that by having new stuff constantly made every day for you to try out. So give it a try if you feel like it, but if you don’t like this type of game, then don’t waste your money on it.6.5/10Don’t go out of your way to recommend it to a friend, but if you find the chance, then go for itBuy it full price if you have the money on hand, but otherwise buy it on sale.~Mfilms2000You can find more of our reviews on our curator page here:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/technosharkreviews "

												This is a very fun strategy game and I would definently recommend. There are quite a few campaigns and plenty of missions to keep you busy. I've already had about 7 hours at the time of this post and I'm not nearly close to doing every mission.You can download custom maps from the steam workshop which adds plenty of more hours of fun!

												I have to say, after 20 hours of playing this game, im still loving it.its a addicting game that punishes you for bad choices and a bad plan.you got to really try with this game, like what had to be done in rainbow six games or SWAT.Game: In this game you take controll of a sqaud of your choice and you can choose exactly everything they use,how they use it, and much more. from a different perspective, its almost like a board game, and you have to look 50 moves ahead. to get new classes, simply play the game! to get new weapons, do the best you can, and earn stars (currency) to get weapons. there are quite a few gamemodes, and each one is thrilling!Extras: there are mods and a level editor.Pros: strategy based game.          fairly balanced.          great gameplay.           alot of different options.           mission generator for random missions.Cons:taser is almost worthless. End: there are some things i missed, but dont worry, this game is great!I would love this game more, if they added more stuning weapons, and made handcuffing everyoneinstead of killing them a challenge it would be much more fun then the game already is. but i feelas though this needs to be added!

												This game really makes you think before you send your teams in. Best blend of tactics and strategy I've ever played in a game. Every mission is different and really makes you put thought into it. So many weapons, armors, and secondaries. You can breach a door with a shotgun and send a squad in with assault rifles with a sniper set outside a window to cover them going in. My favorite part of the game is how you can divvy up your movements into sequences. For instance, once you plan your teams' routes, you can divide their movements to into sections. So. you can have one team sneak in and clear an area silently and cut off an escape route and begin phase ""A"" where another team will blow their door open for a loud entrance and move in. You can then set phases B thru D for movement after things are clear, certain enemies have been eliminated, etc. It's probably the most satisfying when you're preplanned movements finish a mission without pausing it to readjust.I would suggest maybe a headswivel option for when one of your routes end. This would enable one or more units to watch all around them so they don't get snuck up on.I would also suggest a little more user-friendly map creation.Other than that, this is a must-buy game for those interested in a truly amazing tactical/strategic SWAT game.

												A true tactical game, where tactical means planning and not camping. Making sure that each member of the team knows what they are doing before hand, and executing the plan pefectly is a great feeling.With a good multiplayer, it would redefine the entire tactical genre (hopefully planning returns to other tactical-genred games).

												Unique and interesting take on the tactical shooting genre. When starting out it can be a bit frustrating learning all the controls and best ways to utilise each squad member, but after a few levels you'll start to get the hang of it. The turning point for me was taking my time, playing slower and testing out different tactics using flashbangs and the other door breaching methods.Once you get the hang of things and play a bit you'll end up unlocking more guns and classes, making you an even more lethal tactical force to be reckoned with.

												Doorkickers. The name says it all. If you like strategy (or just going on to workshop and finding the most ridiculous thing for your SWAT team to use) then this is the game for you. You kick down the door, shoot people, and that's pretty much it. You can either play it as you go or plan it out right from the start. The game is really optomized to let you time things perfectly, and things that are a little iffy you can easily fix with a couple of workshop mods. It's 50% off when I'm writing this and I think even at its full $20 price its worth a look at.			"

They have guns, save the things, the things die, or the thing does not explode. This is how you win. You can create maps FULL of things and have lots of fun. This game is really cool and for 14 dollars there really isnt much to complain about. There is a basic talent tree that somes up to which weapon you want which little guy to use and how you utilize it. You can customize your team in a boatload of ways. I like this game.

												I'm having a lot of fun with Doorkickers; it is a good strategy game with moderate potential to strategize. My only real complaint is that the game lacks variety in how you can choose to clear a level. This is mainly because the classes and skills you unlock don't offer enough substance, or open up many new methods of playing. For these reasons, the game can start to feel repetitive. I think a lot more imagination could have been applied to the game's design in that department, even while staying in the realm of realism. Still, it is a very good game and a great way to stimulate the old noggin.8/10			"

Combined with levelling up, customising andcontrolling your troopers, the pause/unpause, GO codes and dynamic breaching methods and manouvers this is definently a game worth investing in. Recent updates include lots more challenging maps and campaigns that will keep you hooked for ages. There isn't the same way to complete a mission twice, every time you start a mission, the enemy, hostages and possibly even the bomb change positions, allowing for hours of ever changing fun. Definently a game worth buying, worth every cent. 10/10. Hats off to Killhouse Games.			"

You command a team of SWAT team members as they raid locations in order to rescue hostages, go in for a drug bust, or otherwise eliminate the bad guys.

												A really decent, deep-strategy game that reminds me of the old Rainbow Six games, before they were changed for the commercial market.I highly recommend you to subscribe to Sunshine's epic R6 mod in addition. A must for everyone who enjoys strategy, planning without it being unrewarding.			"

								The game mechanics remind me of the R6 games and SWAT series without the 1st person view.User friendly interface, easy planning and execution but with great depth and smooth gameplay are the game's main characteristics.Reccomended without any reservations. Grub yourself a copy you wont regret it.			"

												I bought this game in early access. Now that it's out I've got to say, it was a worthwhile and positive experience going through the alpha builds of this game.I'd recommend it to anyone that enjoys tactical planning/action. One of the best parts of Door Kickers to me is that every level is fresh; even if you restart the same level 'cause your squad got pwn3d, might happen again and again due to different enemy layouts/routes/actions.Only 'con' I could possibly say about the game is a reeaal lack of narrative per se', but♥♥♥♥♥♥ do you wanna sit there n read about how some fake criminals are oh so bad, or do you wanna kick some doors? ;DPersonal rate: 4 outta 5			"

												A fantastic game. Signed up in early alpha, played the game for a little bit and then decided to sit back and just see what would happen as it developed. Returned yesterday and man have i been pleasantly surprised. It far surpassed all my expectations from all that time ago, and has quickly become a very very enjoyable game.Be warned, very addictive :P as you try over and over to get each level right. And i haven't even scratched the surface of the campaign nor the level up system.10/10 Worth playing if you are at all interested in strategy/tactical games... or even if you just enjoy watching those cool swat entry scenes in movies or on youtube/police shows (ie cops etc etc).Now to learn the game....

												I'm sure that this is a good game, but for a casual scumbag like me (I'll insult myself to save you guys the trouble. You're welcome.), it's not ideal. If you're into strategy games, look no further. If not, don't bother. On to the review.From what I've seen so far (And that says a lot, with less than 30 minutes of gameplay), is that the strategic element is definitely there, and it's well executed. As long as you're not too impatient, you won't have any problems with it. I like that this is the kind of strategy game where you REALLY have to calculate your moves in order to win, as opposed to some where it's favorable but not quite necessary. The art style is pretty appealing to the eye, as it's simple, yet not cartoon-like. I haven't encountered any bugs yet (Perhaps because of the low play time.), so it gets a plus for that. The customization goes around choosing your characters' equipment based on a class system and changing their names, perhaps more, which is quite perfect. The maps are also quite nice, from what I've seen.Did I enjoy the game? No, but that does not mean I think it's bad. Just not my type of game.Do I recomend it? Yes and no, depending on if you like strategy games or not. Though, I know that Door Kickers is a good game for what it is, so I'm giving it a positive review.			"

												An absolutely outstanding experience, I've really never played a game like it before.Door Kickers is a top down, Real time strategy game unlike any other i have played before. you control a swat team of various size depending on the mission you pick, you can either chose single missions or play a campaign mode which is a set of specific missions with varying objectives that span all game types. Drug Busts, Hostage Rescue, Elimination, arrest warrant. and so on.You have two ways you can do this, create a plan in the planning phase or just go all out and control the team members in real time (I do not recomend this) The planning is the star of this game, set each individual team members path of movement and direction they are facing, set certain way points such as getting them to hold a certain position until all hostiles in his field of view are dead or getting them to hold a certain position until you give them the go ahead to continue n their pre-planned path.How well this plan is executed however is dependant on the equipment and upgrades you have unlocked. After each mission you are awarded EXP, how much EXP you are awarded is dependant on how many stars you were rated and how many challenges you completed within the mission.EXP goes toward levels which span your entire team, each time you level up you ear stars and points, the stars can be spent on new and better gear where as the points are spent in the skill tree to improve your team members proficiency with certain weapons.the game has classes, at first you just have the ""point Man"" class but you soon start to unlock the others. Assaulter, Shield, Breacher and Stealth. each one unlocking at a specific milestone. when you first start out you'll most likely spend a lot of time replaying old missions to get used to the mechanics but it's when you've unlocked every class that the game really picks up.Customizing your team per mission with the classes certain missions may need.The game comes with a mission creator though the UI in that map creator isn't very helpful, in fact it feels like more of a hinderence, text of items over lap each other to the point where you can't read them and the creator also offers you no help, no explanation on how to use the funtion.it is a very in depth mission creator when you look at everything you are able to place and control but as i said, it offers you no explanation on how to use these things.For example i clicked on the ""Walls"" tool, expecting myself to be able to place walls only for the walls not showing up at all in the test run of the map and since the creator offers you no help, i had no idea why this wasn't happening.All in all i'd give this ame a 7/10 and that 7 comes from the main game alone, the map creator gets a 0 from me purely because it offers you no help what so ever, like it expects you to know how to use everything without ever having used it before.

												1  Reason i like doorkickers is how its so simple but it makes the game very effective and fun. Its very fun and enjoyble, with lots of fun packed and hard levels but it dont just t end there as there is its own in game generator and even map editor. The only problem i find that will effective a few people is that some of the mission's need allot of planning but if you don't like planning well then this game is gonna be bad for you. but going back into the good side again is that i like how its very strategic because you dotn just send your men into  room with hostiles in there but you have to like throw a grenade or flashbang which i think makes it good cuz then its a challenge. anyway overall i rate this game a 8.5/10 very enjoyable but you need to like planning and stuff			"

								Based on the 21 June 14 Beta:I watched a Nerdcubed Alpha Detective on Youtube for this and it looked fun. Only had a small discount in the Summer Sale, but got it anyway. So glad I did.Massively addictive game and has that ""one more go"" feel. Just playing through the single missions trying to 3 star them all. Has that X-com trait of being protective of your leveled up guys. Only criticism so far is that the guns seem too similar. There are 7 or 8 hand guns and the best one is easy to unlock so its pointless to even bother with the ones in between. The better Assault rifles have a better leveling up/unlocking range.  Don't normally bother with game editors, but going to try on this - seems easy to use from the little play I had.  "

												Rewardingly and frustratingly difficult. I found myself striving to get five stars on absolutely every mission, going every angle, weapon, and piece of gear to get the perfect combination. Careful planning is generously encouraged since every time I didn't carefully plan ( and a lot of times when I did ) the game would brutally punish and have my whole squad wiped out by one guy in one corner I didn't think I'd need to sweep on entry. With 33 hrs in as of writing this, I still haven't gotten through all the campaign levels, which are unique in approach and scale compared to the shorter missions menu. I tried fiddling with the level builder, and its kind of a pain. Could be more intuitive.If you're a perfectionist, be wary. Also, a less tactics dependant game called breach and clear is pretty good if you end up liking this game.			"

												To start this off i dont write many reviews so I hope its ok and ill keep it short and sweet.OMFG Door Kickers is so amazing I just had to review it. So I like strategy games and have only played a few really decent ones (my opinion) Xcom, JA2 and this weird old school flash game called Field Commando or something, Field commando was a 'crappy lil game' that looked like it took 2 seconds to make but the idea of controlling (Very restricted) a military squad was awesome. Door Kickers is what i dreamt Field  Commando would have been if they worked harder. IT IS AMAZING.Pros - Great soundtrack, Keeps up the tension/atmosphere.        - Massive range of difficulty.        - Different types of missions (not just take out the enemy but arresting people and rescuing hostages)        - Graphics are better then Field Commando (you're not a circle haha)        - (To me) Highly replayable, yes I might not sit here for hours playing it but I will deffinatley play it  again and again  when im bored or have time to kill.        - Reasonably priced (although i got 75% off in steam sales paid like 5 bucks US)         - Unlock weapons and armour.        - You can have a squad of like 8 men all taking out different targets at the same time. Feels good to wipe out like 20  enemies in like 2 seconds.Cons - Not many         - Graphics could still be better.         - It will frustrate the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you.         - Times dissappears when you have 'just one more crack at the mission'         - Few glitches and my guys died a few times getting shot from someone who they couldnt shoot(i was hiding and they could see and arm, enemies could shoot me but my guy just took it and died.BoldyB - Give it a go. Better value for money then WarZ.....oh wait Infestation surviv......oh you lost interest :(			"

												Highly recommended for all fans of tactical games. It's already a very addictive and fun game and it's just alpha! It's quite similar to Frozen Synapse in some ways, but it's pausable real time(you will pause quite a bit) instead of being turn based. This kind of a plan & pause system is perfect for the game. You have a wide selection of weapons to choose from and there will be squad progression with promotions, etc. It's great now and it will be even better when all the features are implemented.----------------------------Post release UPDATE: The game is now better than ever. Many things are improved and implemented, including individual trooper level progression, campaign and iron man mode(missions can't be restarted, but you get double EXP), etc. The game is even better with the Rainbow Six character and sound mods (available on Steam Workshop!)

												A brilliant and frustratingly hard tactical squad-based game. For the most part the physics, AI and mechanics are fluid and well done, with a few annoying moments from your squad who react unpredictably. I guess, to a degre, this adds realism perhaps. I love tactical and strategy games and I find this hugely fun, with loads of missions, custom maps, squad upgrades and challenges. It has a lot of replay value for me, though I can see some people feeling otherwise. It is definitely still worth the money however. My only gripe is that some of the classes have to be unlocked by levelling your squad and this feels a bit like a mechanic from a cheap or free mobile phone game, and feels really irritating at times when you are faced with a scenario and you long for one of the locked classes. Minor issue, however. If you play it lots and do well you quickly unlock all the classes.			"

												This is a really cool little game. I bought it on a whim, and I have put a fair amount of time into it since then, and I'm glad I bought it.It can be difficult, but it never feels impossible. I do get frustrated from time to time, usually I'm only good for about an hour of play at a time. However, any time I walk away my brain keeps processing whatever level I was stuck on, and then I make whole new plans that I have to come back and try out. Keeping me hooked so far.			"

The only problem i find that will effective a few people is that some of the mission's need allot of planning but if you don't like planning well then this game is gonna be bad for you. but going back into the good side again is that i like how its very strategic because you dotn just send your men into  room with hostiles in there but you have to like throw a grenade or flashbang which i think makes it good cuz then its a challenge. anyway overall i rate this game a 8.5/10 very enjoyable but you need to like planning and stuff			"

												One of the best tactical games I have ever played. For an overhead 'god' sort of game, this is the best one out there. Combined with levelling up, customising andcontrolling your troopers, the pause/unpause, GO codes and dynamic breaching methods and manouvers this is definently a game worth investing in. Recent updates include lots more challenging maps and campaigns that will keep you hooked for ages. There isn't the same way to complete a mission twice, every time you start a mission, the enemy, hostages and possibly even the bomb change positions, allowing for hours of ever changing fun. Definently a game worth buying, worth every cent. 10/10. Hats off to Killhouse Games.			"

												This is awesome. There's almost like three games in one here, the first type where you just control the game as normal and try to win the mission, the second type where you do it with one guy, and the third type where you do it as a ""one plan only"" style. Each type is interesting enough to stand out from the other, and it also has an interesting campaign mode series. There are a few minor control quirks but once you get used to the system you can do pretty powerful plans. There's pretty much no storyline to speak of though, which is something that could be worked on.			"

												Great game recommend you try it out if you are a fan of any of the tags.Pros:Great game (vague i know...) somewhat simple controls (this is where it transitions from all commands to some commands with you taking control  of watching your 6 in a reverse facing advance).Match time can varry...expect missions to take anywhere from  5 seconds to 1 min. (depends) with 5 mins. to 20 mins being spent in the planing (as they say..♥♥♥♥♥♥poor planing makes for♥♥♥♥♥♥poor performance).I like the A.I. it uses, dont know much in this depatment but gotta say its on par for making each of the 100's of matches that much more difficult than the last...Cons:At this point for me in the game there are few complaints... uhhh shotgun is OP, the m4 needs rework, add options for ammunition type the interface initally gets takes some getting used to add M4 SBR variant (short barreled rifle)add depth maybe by adding manufacter category, score sponsorships with the companies...I do not mind meters, but do it justice visually, everything seems so cramped, and make furniture a little less bothersome.WIll Update more later if I can			"

												It was a bit of a guess when i bought it, but was i glad i did.i can spend hours just playing this game. It is something new i havent played before. It reminds me a bit of the good old swat 2 but then on steroids. i can spend a good half hour planning in advance and then just watch the actual 10 seconds of gameplay that is required of the mission. Also the fact that everything keeps changing up is also an added bonus for me. no way to tell if the plan that worked last time will work again. Since the AI actually moves around in a different way everytime and the oponents seem to move as well. I can highly recomend this game. I have enjoyed every second of it so far :)			"

								As a huge fan of the SWAT games I've had my eye on this for some time. After checking out some of the early access reviews I decided to dip my toes in and see what this game had to offer so far - so far, I'm not disappointed. There's a great amount of satisification to watching your carefully planned moves play out and learning from the ones that end in disaster. At this stage, the different classes of character don't seem to come into play but I look forward to sending a stealth team in and perhaps even non-lethal options at a later stage.			"

Out of the box, the game provides more content than you would expect. Totally worth buying.One last thing, the Linux version works great and is very smooth.			"

The game has a lot of awesome content. The interface is user friendly and doesn't take long to learn. While the game is paused you can give orders to your officers and design a route for them to follow.  You can play the game in real time too if you like to live dangerous. The squad members are kept on a roster and they sort of grow on you. I love this game.			"

												Door Kickers: 6/10Door Kickers is an interesting concept -- one that's been done before, but not as often as people hope. The cult classic Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield being the quintessential example of this type of game, Door Kickers takes a similar approach in trying to create an atmosphere of tactical tension, albeit with a bit of levity involved in the presentation. In recent years, we've also seen the well-made Breach & Clear released, which was an underappreciated game that took the Rainbow Six formula, made it purely top-down, and focused the action in on three-second pseudo-realtime moments.So, there is quite an audience for this type of game built in already -- many people love this type of tactical action for two reasons; as games, they provide a thrill unlike any other. This isn't Call of Duty, where rasberry jam will be smeared all over your character's face if you improperly clear a room: if you fail to properly check your corners, your character will die, and this creates a sheer tension towards entering and moving through buildings in any properly executed Tactical game. A second reason is more of a gritty tactical feel -- it's not really the thrill of playing a game, but the thrill of using real tactics, real equipment, and truly mastering these raids until you can defeat most levels on the first try. Rainbow Six leaned towards the latter. Breach & Clear aimed towards the former. Door Kickers gets stuck somewhere in the middle.As a game, Door Kickers has a very 'hotshot' atmosphere. The achievements, menu tips, and even the interface all make it out as a Call of Duty-esque experience that challenges you to play. The gameplay can either be taken very tactically and slowly,  or in a more brash realtime mode where squaddies will just follow your mouse as long as you hold and drag them around. Neither of these modes works perfectly. For example; as a game, the gameplay quickly falls apart when you realize just how rote and routine winning each level becomes. Going back to Breach & Clear, each level was interesting enough, but sweeping rooms was really only half the battle. Using your items and abilities intelligently was really what carried you forwards. In Door Kickers, using items effectively is useful, but nonessential. Setting up intelligent fire zones and sweeping a room carefully will let you beat every single level in the game with the basic Assault class.And speaking more towards classes, the RPG elements of Door Kickers are not as deep as those presented in other games. If you're going to put a character progression system into a game, it has to feel like your characters are progressing. Let me explain: XCom: Enemy Unknown is a perfect example. In the earliest parts of the game, your recruits are pathetic. They can't shoot, they can't hit anything, and they have no useful abilities. They'll get slaughtered. However, as you play more and more, you really begin to bond with them; you create little vignettes in your head of everything they've done as soldiers, and you see them come to life with powerful abilities and interesting weapons. You thrill at their victories, and gasp at their failures. In Breach & Clear, this also happens; you create a squad of soldiers and deploy them for the entire game, slowly levelling them to the point of creating a cohesive crack team of unique and varied soldiers. Door Kickers really just expediates this process to the point where it's completely pointless. I had a maximum-level squad within the first five hours of gameplay, and none of my squad members really stood out. The small stat increases they receive are fairly pointless, and it's really their loadout that affects things more than their actual skill. Furthermore, you can just swap all of them between classes at will, so there's no real reason to specialize anyone. You gain a lot of tactical freedom, but lose all of the characters and personality that could've been developed here.So, Door Kickers isn't really a perfect game -- it's not too challenging, nor is it really relatable. So, is it, at least, tactical? To a degree, I would say it is, but in a very frustrating way. As aforementioned, it works as a room clearing simulator. Entering a room is interesting and fun, and you begin to pick up some actual tactical acumen as you play through the game. But then, you begin to suddenly realize what a dearth of options there really are in the game. You, of course, have five classes. Pointman - which becomes entirely useless about twenty minutes into the game, Assault - Which is the only class you really need to win every map, Breacher - Which is a nice class to have, but becomes a short-ranged assault about three hours into the game, Shield - Which is slow moving, doesn't do much damage, and is incredibly situational, and finally Stealth - Which is very similar to Assault, but completely superfluous and is preferable in only a few tiny instances.Now, the thing you may have noticed is that all of these classes seem to just bleed into the Assault class towards the end; the shield is, perhaps, the only one that remains entirely unique, and it's so rarely useable that it becomes like a health potion in a roleplaying game. You look at it, sigh, and say to yourself, ""Maybe next time. I should save it."" Furthermore, the inventories on all of the classes are almost entirely identical. Taking a game like Rainbow Six into account, you could arm any individual soldier with eight categories of weapons, each of which had twenty weapons, and several ammunition subtypes -- and that's not even getting into the modification system. In this game, each class has about 16 weapons available, and no modification system to speak of. As far as items go, the game is at a loss as well; this is a game about breaching and clearing rooms, so where the hell are the doorjams? Where are the fragmentation grenades? Where are the smoke grenades? Heartbeat sensors? Instead, you have some very basic options in the form of:Flashbangs - The most useful item in the game.Stingers - Very situational, not recommended.Breaching Charges - Situational, but you need something to pad your inventory.Lockpicks - Situational.Hammer - SituationalSnakecam - Mandatory.And a few others. Out of all of these, the three most useful ones are automatically equipped on the characters at the start of the game, making it pretty basic to load your troops out.So, then you get into the tactical meat of the game, and you become inundanted in a complete nightmare of artificial stupidity. The game makes a point to challenge you to use one plan to clear the entire building from the start of the match -- this is standard. Rainbow Six 1-3 were based on this concept of planning, and the planning room in this game is a pretty close recreation of what those games had. The only issue comes with the AI; both friendly and hostile. Your own troops are, for the most part, somewhat intelligent, but have moments of immense stupidity that make you want to throw your keyboard across the room. Your men start approaching a door, 2x2 cover formation. The door opens -- they quickly blow away the mook with an AK on the other side, and..They completely freeze in place. Why? Because I had them set to lockpick that door that he just blew open. The soldiers can't understand that the door isn't there, so they just stand and patiently wait. This is all well and fine when you have four guys stacked up, but when one soldier tries to pick the lock and a guy with a pistol opens the door, that soldier will just freeze, completely nonresponsive for minutes on end as the enemy tries to blow through his heavy body armor with the equivalent of an airsoft gun. I'd type more, but I have to cut this short; the game is buggy, unfair, and pretty shallow, but it's the closest a game has gotten to the old Rainbow Six feel. If you like those games, get it. You won't regret it.			"

												I got this because I love turn-based combat and games like Frozen Synapse bring me great enjoyment. I was not disappointed. The customisation for your squad is pretty good (though I'm unclear what some stats even do), the strategy is fairly deep without being overwhelming, and unlike other games of the genre, it can actually be advantageous to play in ""real time"" sometimes.There were a couple of minor annoyances for me, like some doorways creating dead angles where the AI can shoot at me but I can't shoot back, even though the two guys are actually touching guns (giggity), using stairways is ""fiddly"" at best, and some mechanics are frustrating because they're never really explained anywhere (like gun handling when passing corners, body-blocking, etc). I also kinda miss being able to crouch, but that's a minor nitpick.All in all: super fun, very addictive gameplay, would recommend any day of the week.			"

												This game is awesome. It has it's flaws though, mostly when you lose a fully armored trooper to a mac-10 for sure. The response time on some of the troops could be better for sure though. Otherwise i enjoy this game its fun to see, once you've completed a level, where the enemies were and try to do it with less troopers or with different kinds of troopers. It keeps it original. Also a lot of the levels the game provides are not ""set"" per say, they have random spawn locations and spawn amounts on some of them where the enemy may be around the corner on one run and another there's two or they're not there at all. Also the gun mods on the community make playing extra random generated levels that much better, as it challenges you to unlock those guns first, then try them out in a new map and see their performance.10/10 great buy			"

												Lots of fun and pretty great set up. Mods really allow for an increase in content like weapons and gear that one might find missing. I will say that mapping can be rather time consuming and that there are some missed opportunities for refinement between the PC and tablet versions where you really feel like you're playing a tablet game on a PC. Its exciting and tons of fun and the developers and community are really supportive and you will soon find yourself spending hours trying to get things just right! 9/10			"

												I have to admit, I didn't expect much from the top down shooter but man was I wrong.  Once you learn the basics of technique it really is addicting to master the seemingly unlimited map scenarios.  For anyone who enjoys the rainbow six series (especially the older and more detailed planning versions) you will enjoy this game.  The controls are straight forward, plan a route and find the best way to clear the various rooms.  I found myself restarting the challenges over until I attained 3 stars a piece.  I am 5 hours into the single mission maps and have noet yet began any of the campaigns.  only downside to the game from what I have read, is that when a character dies, the player is gone forever.  That is unless you do some scum saving.			"

												So, you're probably sitting here thinking, ""Why don't I just get Breach and Clear?"". Here are a few reasons why this game is AWESOME! I got Door Kickers in the autumn sales for £2 (I'm a sucker for a bargain) already I have put 4.1 hours into the game just by playing before and after school before dinner. This game is amazing!The sheer brilliance of the customisation means you can have all kinds of you own ""classes"" on top of the pre-made ones! For example, I created a line up of solely pointmen with silenced pistols and took out the targets with stealth and cunning rather than brute force. It was cool to think I could do all of these new cool tactics!Now, I'm not one to go through a game and get three stars on every level. I just get bored. But for Door Kickers? The fact that you need stars to customise your squad means I want to 100% the game!Also, another great thing is that the most expensive gun/armour/shield isn't nessecarily the best gun/armour/shield! It's all about how you play the game! You can also upgrade the weapon skills of your squad with pistols, long guns and shotguns! This adds a whole other dynamic to the game as you can upgrade your perks or equipment strategically depending on one other!And of course you can name each member squad! You can be as creative as you like! You could call your ""crack-shot-with-a-pistol-guy"" anything from ""Dead-eye"" to ""Sh**head"" This enables you to be slightly attached to your men and be upset if they are killed in the line of fire. And yes, if your men are killed during a campaign, they will not be replaced by new men until you have won/lost the whole campaign! This makes you think about your choices more carefully during an assault on a building.I would highly recommend this game to ANYONE no matter what games they like/play! I recommend picking it up, especially in a sale! Worth the £14.99 its sold for! "

												This game is fresh to me. I haven't played anything quite like it. You can't do campaign mode right away, you have to play a few single missions and level up first. This is basically to get you warmed up for the campaign missions because campaign there is perma death. Your task force officers rank up too, and your level points get you better gear. Basically a mission operates in 3 phases1. Deploy mode. Select your officers and deploy them onto the mission site in a selected area. 2. Planning mode. This is where you trace out the movement and actions of each officer. There are a variaty of options on how to do this depending on rank and equipment. 3. Execution mode. This is when the mission starts and your men begin to perform your plan, you can go back to planning mode at anytime and redo the planor if you're feeling brave you can do the planning and execution simultaniously. At the end of your mission you are graded by speed, deaths, and overall performance. 3 star ranking gets you more XP which can be used for more lethal officers and tactics. Planning mode gets complcated quick, you can customize it to do so many things like switch weapons, look in certain directions, don't move again until enemies cleared, and there are even wait for order Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, or Delta so a certain officer will wait until you click the order and then continue as plan. This game is quick paced, and a great time killer. I think I will enjoy it for a long time, classic replay value. Overall I give it 8 out of 10 ♥♥♥♥ Pandas			"

Steam Workshop support.For trhe money I paid in the sale, its a must buy for anyone who enjoyed early Rainbow 6 games (the ones where you planned the routes for different squads) or the SWAT games. It plays very similar to Frozen Synapse and Survivor Squad, but feels much deeper and more tactical.Exellent game!			"

												It was a bit of a guess when i bought it, but was i glad i did.i can spend hours just playing this game. It is something new i havent played before. It reminds me a bit of the good old swat 2 but then on steroids. i can spend a good half hour planning in advance and then just watch the actual 10 seconds of gameplay that is required of the mission. Also the fact that everything keeps changing up is also an added bonus for me. no way to tell if the plan that worked last time will work again. Since the AI actually moves around in a different way everytime and the oponents seem to move as well. I can highly recomend this game. I have enjoyed every second of it so far :)			"

												Wow, been looking for a game like this for a long time. Door Kickers harks back to the classic days of late 90s PC gaming, specifically games like Rainbow 6 & SWAT - ""tooling-up"" a hit team with your own unique load out of weaponry, formulating a plan to take down the bad guys, and executing that plan in syncronicty with your various teams. I love devising new strategies for maps, and the ability to change you orders rapidly and easily on the fly is what makes the game special. There's challenges and a tech tree to climb to keep things interesting and satisfy different playing styles.Relatively simple, but utterly addictive and thoroughly satisfying. If you like a mix of planning, strategy and action - this game is for you!			"

												Door Kickers is the best top down tactical simulator in the world in my opinion, and I have played a lot of top down simulators. Door Kickers has very rich components, from its music to its tactics. The music is extremely atmospheric, making it feel like Payday 2, except you're the tactical advisor. The tactics are extremely rich, giving you so much space to establish the best path and tactic to get the mission done. And you have a lot of customization for the SWAT Officers on your team, whether he/she would be a pointman or breacher, wielding a shotgun or rifle.The client is also very smooth and slick, allowing for uninterrupted and smooth gameplay. And with randomly generated doors to kickdown, the game is endless and can be educational. Making sure your officers never forget to check their corners and always stop before entering a room when your fellow officer hasn't caught up with you. This is a very realistic tactical simulator and is an essential game to stratagy lovers.			"

												One of my favorite strategy games out there. I can't believe I haven't given it a review yet. The controls are easy enough to use, but to master utilizing them to your advantage is a challenge. The guns and classes are varied and the gameplay is addicting. PLAY THE GAME!protip: If you can, look up real life CQB SWAT tactics and Doorkickers gameplay for guidance. The only gripe I have with this game is that they never give you any real tutorial.			"

												Great game to get (especially on a summer sale) with great mechanics, customization options, and strategies to keep you on edge.You can also make your own maps or just randomly generate one with a seed or options given to you (Size:Medium, enemy power:high, ect.)There is a LOT of content. Maps, Guns, Armor, Classes, and more than one Campaign.And this game works well with the Workshop. You can get mods and custom maps other people made (Ex. Stormtrooper Mod, Metal Gear Soundtrack, and cs_office map).**The ONLY problem with the game is that if you play it for a couple of hours it feels repetative, but that doesnt mean you dont come back to play it again and again*** "

												I feel that this is a very good game. I like the game concept and pacing of the missions. The missions are interesting but short enough. The game mechanics are not difficult to learn, but level design and the equipment customization ability allows one to try multiple approaches to complete a mission. With good planning of equipment and paths, the team can complete the actual mission in very short time. There are some things that can be improved. For example, the UI makes it difficult to pick individual team members when they stand very closely together. Path creation UI can also be improved, e.g. to allow easy modification of an early segment without having to redo the rest of the path. The variety of weapons also don't seem to matter so much -- for example, many of rifle choices for assaulter class don't seem to offer distinct advantage compared to e.g. P90 or SAR-18 option. Lastly, it's better if some action options are added, e.g. ability for a team member to look around and clear the room before moving. At the moment, there's only option to look at one direction, confirm that it's clear, move slightly, look at another direction, confirm that it's clear, and so on. Another ability that will come in handy is the ability to synchronize team member to only move after a flashbang (without using go codes), the ability to specify alternate action (e.g. when the door that is supposed to be breached is already opened by someone else), and ability to combine actions on one item during planning (e.g. unlock the door, then throw a flashbang through it).Having said that, those issues are minor, and I still highly recommend this game.

After we move together in the living room. Look again in my pad. Ok Bronson, but I don't think it's so easy like this game show.Charles, we did this many times, don't be a ♥♥♥♥♥.Aye Bronson, but I'm tired to repeat again just to take the 3 starts, I would like to move to the next step with the other guys and the smg.I've understood, let try it once again, ok?OK OK, after all we are getting better, I remember my first time where I need to understand to trow the flash-bang before to break into the room, and we had both only a light jacket and stupid guns. I hope to be ready soon to join the guys in the big campaign.Aye, but you know how that our commander is a dammed control freak, he whats that we reach all the goal to get better resources to equip us. Do you think that I was happy to deal with the 6 terrorist alone last time? I don't give a s**t to ""improve the performance"" or ""get under the national average time, boy"". If he keep doing that I am going to report to the HR office.Definitely he's mad, easy to stay in the office and plan everything on the board, telling do that, after that, wait for A, wait for B... sometimes I haven't enough time to reload, and he wants that I break in a kitchen after a fight against 5 Santos.Pete, liking the right part now he's working as a sniper, easy job, no danger and he doesn't have to help to clean or take the evidences.Silence, he's just finished to plan again, be ready.A, engage! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Charles and Bronson like:- put in pause to update the strategy- select many roles, weapons and equip (well, it depends to the commander strategy)- hold the position and let the other guys go ahead- a good plan- the possibility to coordinate complex actions.Charles and Bronson doesn't like:- censured by the captainThe captain like:- challenges- random situation- a huge quantity of scenarios, to make stronger his position when he will run for the Major seat- be stealth to collect much drugs is possible- be ramboid to collect much macho statusJohn ""Hannibal"" Smith opinion:""I love it when a plan comes together.

												Whilst it's good fun to plan your attack the point of doing so is ruined somewhat by the randomness of the game.An entrance that can work twice in a row can fail on the third because the enemies suddenly kill you whereas previuosly they didn't. I'm assuming that this is because they have an element of randoness when they are generated or open fire.In other games this would be fair enough as it keeps the level from becoming too linear however in a game that tries to sell itself on the planning aspect it becomes pretty annoying quite quickly.You can edit the maps to remove the random enemy start points and play each one as a custom map but this means you don't get the progression of characters and equipment etc. that you would playing them normally.Maybe it's just me as I think the game would work much better if it were more like a puzzle game where your planning actually counted for more. I am still recommending it if picked up in a sale.			"

												This game knows what it is and what it aims to be and accomplishes that very well.  I got this in a bundle that was very cheap, and it blew me away.  At it's full retail price, you'd probably want to look into some gameplay videos first to make sure it's something that you'd enjoy.  The big factor being that it focuses much more on strategy and team prep than rich 3d graphics and hero-esque characters.It can be brutal, but encourages creative thinking and being smart about your choices.  Losing a squad mate has weight here, and helps to push you to be careful with your actions, which adds a big immersive element.  Squad progression is done nicely, which makes the game's overall progression feel more balanced, and adds depth to an already fun set of mechanics.If this is on sale or in a bundle, it's an absolute no brainer, if only to test your strategic mettle.  If you enjoy strategy above all else in your games, even if you aren't a fan of military themes/shooters, this is still a great value.			"

												For the complete review: https://retrospectgamer.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/door-kickers-review/You’re given an entire SWAT team to manage, their basic equipment to upgrade, and bunch of missions to complete. The missions themselves are quite interesting, with difficult situations like hostage rescue arising from time to time.The artwork is good, and the special effects are alright. And so is the soundtrack. Nothing spectacular.The controls are not the best, as drawing lines around and on top of existing ones can get quite glitchy.Everything said, this game is definitely different from anything I've played so far.I recommend this game for anyone looking for a new experience in the ‘tactical’ department.

												Decent game but has many shortcommings. Wait for sale and get it dirt cheap.Level design spans from good to clowncars of baddies - even in home invasion mission there are 1-3 people in every single room of 3 story apartment and you get 4 troppers to clear that! upgrade progression makes no sense in this type of game and is very limiting - it is a big hump at the start of the game, ranking missions based on complete time makes no sense in this type of game (and you need lotsa stars to unlock Stealth class, takes forever!), givig you worthless recruits makes no sense. Too many weapons which do not differ much if at all cluttering the list.The troops will show too much initiative and shoot the first guy they see even if you order them to hook around the doorway and check the far corner, but at the same time they need to be instructed to sidestep around every corner.RNG aspects: your troops will occasionally fail to fire first when a tango shows up even if they are aimed exactly at the corner and static. No ammount of foresight can prevent this on occasions.Did I mention star system? Cannot 3 star all missions as you go along, most of them need equipment and classes you will unlock later, so you might need 1 star many to them go back and try to redo them.I spent hours few years bacl playing Rouge Spear in spectator mode and I expected this to be better.

												Did you play the original Rainbow Six?  Do you remember the part of the game where you got to make the plan for your whole team, and then watch them execute it?  Did you love that part? Buy this game.Do you wish that X-COM and Hotline Miami had a baby and it was about cops?Buy this game.Do you play games on the highest difficulty because you want a fair challenge?Buy this game.I wholeheartedly recommend this game.

												Just a nice throw back to the Rainbow 6: Raven Shield game. But done without the FPS element. All about tactics, and the methodical approach which are rewarded. This game rewards the micromanagers out there, a.k.a. trust issue operators.Protip: Practice strafing. Use the Go commands as often.  "

There are very few negative reviews for this game, and that is for good reason.  If you want a tactical swat game this is pretty good.I was excited to play it after a foray into Breach and Clear, which I thought was very good. This game is better in that the pacing is a little faster.  But everything else, IMO, is worse than what you will get with Breach and Clear.  The graphics here aren't great, which is a given since it's a tablet game.  The sound isn't great either; and the animations are clumsy at best.  The controls also feel a little imprescise, having my officer face the wrong way is common.Still, it's not a bad game, and I think most people will have fun.			"

												I feel that this is a very good game. I like the game concept and pacing of the missions. The missions are interesting but short enough. The game mechanics are not difficult to learn, but level design and the equipment customization ability allows one to try multiple approaches to complete a mission. With good planning of equipment and paths, the team can complete the actual mission in very short time. There are some things that can be improved. For example, the UI makes it difficult to pick individual team members when they stand very closely together. Path creation UI can also be improved, e.g. to allow easy modification of an early segment without having to redo the rest of the path. The variety of weapons also don't seem to matter so much -- for example, many of rifle choices for assaulter class don't seem to offer distinct advantage compared to e.g. P90 or SAR-18 option. Lastly, it's better if some action options are added, e.g. ability for a team member to look around and clear the room before moving. At the moment, there's only option to look at one direction, confirm that it's clear, move slightly, look at another direction, confirm that it's clear, and so on. Another ability that will come in handy is the ability to synchronize team member to only move after a flashbang (without using go codes), the ability to specify alternate action (e.g. when the door that is supposed to be breached is already opened by someone else), and ability to combine actions on one item during planning (e.g. unlock the door, then throw a flashbang through it).Having said that, those issues are minor, and I still highly recommend this game.

												Once I thought a turn-based strategy game with guns was silly, you can't fire while moving, you can't plan precisely to kill multiple targets at the same time, shooting each other behind cover is just boring, mostly it's only about random numbers and luck, and it takes long to retry a mission if you get messed up.Then I found Door Kickers, and it's just all I wanted.Realtime strategy with free pauseSo many maps and missions, even random generated mapsLots of guns and equipsMap editor and MODsIf you want more challenge, try realtime with no pause or one single planJust can't ask for more			"

It has that ""i can do that better"" feeling, getting you to replay levels to keep all your guys alive, to get that perfect rating.And, as of this writing, its part of a Humble Bundle deal.

												Overall: DecentLikes:- A lot of content- Has procedurally-generated levels- Supports player-created contentDislikes:- Planning out your strategy takes quite a bit of time, even for relatively simple levels.  It's fun but it is also tiresome.- Controlling your characters in real time feels laggy because they move slower than your mouse, and inputs get queued.- I wish you could undo changes to your plan, and save your plans for later use.  I also wish you could edit a section of your route without erasing the subsequent path.- In campaign mode, once you leave a mission, your current state (health, deaths) is saved and you can't retry it from the original state you were in when you first played that mission.  Not a huge deal though.			"

Product received for free
												Broke my game with mods, sent a very detailed email to Support, they resent me the files to fix the game while also helping me pinpoint the possible mod(s) that broke my game, fixed (and learnt how to fix the problem after an accidental peek of the .xml files). Back to kicking doors and dropping baddies. I do want to point out that some of the bad guys in body armor can take a lot more bullets than you would expect even with high powered rifle rounds that you'd normally expect to go through whatever the bad guys can afford (apparently they can afford AR500 Level 4 armor) so if you're playing without mods, do expect some heavy resistence and lots of baddies with level 4 AR500 if you're using the mission generator and you have enemy resistence setting set to heavy (w/e that one setting is called). Lots of fun, loving the game, great Support, can't wait for DK2 to come out in the near future.Edit: Tasers are fun to use.Edit #2: I can't stop tasering people. I need help.			"

												Show those doors who's the boss!Non maymay review: A perfect blend of real time and turn based strategy brought to you by the tactical pause button. It could be compared to Breach and Clear, although there are many differences. B&C is closer to turn based strategy, although the turns happen in real time, and has arguably better graphics. Doorkickers instead, has a an, also arguably, better general gameplay, despite lacking some of the RPG elements that help Breach & Clear add some depth. Like B&C, has tons of levels and lots of replayability if you like unlocking weapons and gear. Its already long shelf life is lengthened even more with the addition of mods (deploying snipers is nice!). My dream game undoubtedly has a combat system like Doorkickers. You can plan, hit play, pause, correct your plan on the go... I wish Jagged Alliance: Back In Action was this fluid. I wholeheartedly recommend this game.			"

												For the complete review: https://retrospectgamer.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/door-kickers-review/You’re given an entire SWAT team to manage, their basic equipment to upgrade, and bunch of missions to complete. The missions themselves are quite interesting, with difficult situations like hostage rescue arising from time to time.The artwork is good, and the special effects are alright. And so is the soundtrack. Nothing spectacular.The controls are not the best, as drawing lines around and on top of existing ones can get quite glitchy.Everything said, this game is definitely different from anything I've played so far.I recommend this game for anyone looking for a new experience in the ‘tactical’ department.

The pricetag is a bit much for something that does grow tiresome fairly quickly. Games like this might be better suited to a mobile platform like a tablet, albeit at a lower price (say $3-5). That doesn't, however, make this a bad game, just a little lacking. I'll recommend this game for people that like games like FTL and maybe X-Com. Buy this on sale.			"

												An awesome game. A 2D Rainbow Six is a nice way of describing it, but it's less FPS and a bit more tactical.It can be somewhat challenging to get used to the controls, since its gameplay is very unique.There's also lots of content available, not to mention the mission generator or editor. Out of the box, the game provides more content than you would expect. Totally worth buying.One last thing, the Linux version works great and is very smooth.			"

												This game is pretty great.  It may be a remake of another game, as it seems like a very natural concept for people to want to play, but KillHouse Games definitely nailed it!It's a top-down, RTS style SWAT simulator.  With enough weapons and achievements to make this game worth playing for hours on end, and the random killhouse generator, it's hard to put down.  Consider me addicted!			"

												Ignore the time Steam says I have played. I have played about 14 hours of the game overall, most of it done offline while I was traveling.Similar to: Hotline Miami, Rainbow Six 3, SWAT 4Pros-Simple controls that anyone can pick up.-Can be played with one hand.-Game mechanics may be simple, but allow for extremely complex strategies to be played out.-Versetile level editor.-Lots of content in the game, hundreds of standalone missions ranging in difficulty, as well as a handful of campaigns lasting 1 to 2 hours each.-Randomized mission generator.-Scenario Variety-Perfect game to play on a laptop if you have a mouse.-Officer and Squad progression. (new skills, weapons, and classes to unlock)-Pause and play allows you to assess the situation on an action by action basis, giving the player time to think and plan.-Good soundtrack.-Playing with your own music/podcast in the background takes nothing away from the game. Cons-Enviroments can get repetitive. (The level design is varried, I'm talking about the way they look)-Controls don't work well when trying to play in real time.-Some of the bigger levels can get tedious, especially if you are stuck looking for the last enemy, hostage, bomb, etc.-How fast your guys react to getting shot at is random at times.-Steath is underdeveloped.ConclusionThis is the most fun I have had in an RTS ever. This is coming from someone who doesn't really like RTS games. I decided to give this game a shot, mainly because I am a fan of squad based Tactical FPS's (Swat 4 and Arma 3 being my favorites) and this game shared the same concepts. Overall, the game is accessible, but still has the complexity to please seasoned RTS verterans.Recommended to: Players who are looking for an accessible game that has a challenging tactical experience that does not rely on clunky UI or twitch shooting.9 out of 10			"

												A real-time with pause game that requires you to plan carefully before engaging the bad guys. The squad as a whole could level up, earning you 'doctrines' to spend on the provided tech tree. Each squad member could also level up to improve their stats. You gain 'stars' after each successful mission, which you can spend on unlocking new weapons/armors/items that you can assign to any squad member. You could play the built-in missions, generate random ones, or create your own with the editor.So, yes, the game is worth every penny.			"

												Door Kickers is a game about commanding 2 to 8 armed officers, and fighting randomly generated terrorists through premade maps.This game's controls are simple and easy to understand, but can also provide the ability to execute advanced commands and the ability to co-ordinate your team.There are 5 classes to choose from, I have unlocked only 4 at the time of writing this review, and I can say that the shield has served me practically no use, although the other 3 classes (Pointman, Assaulter, Breacher) have proved most useful and indespensible aspects of a successful team.The way of customizing loadouts is using a currency called stars. You unlock these stars by completing missions and completing certain criteria, the criteria to earn a full three stars are to not lose a single unit and to score a time below the limit given. This must not be confused with a speedrun, as the game can be paused and tactics and actions can be prepared in the paused state, ready to be performed when the game is running again. 15 seconds ingame can become a whole minute if you pause a lot.However, if you spend your stars on bad weapons, or on one class alone, you may find yourself in a whole that you dug yourself into, and I thoroughly dislike the randomly generated terrorists, and I found my troops sometimes turning their back to danger despite my orders.(Edit 1) In the campaigns, which are a series of missions in which soldiers are perminently KIA for the duration of it if lost, I have found that soldiers that are killed are lost, and their stat gains from promotions are also lost. This adds a benefit to not just going ham and sending all of your men in to be slaughtered, which is always a plus for an RTS.But overall, I would recommend this game, I felt like quite a badass.And if you need an arbitrary rating, it gets my 8/10.

												Door Kickers is reminiscent of the tactical SWAT games appropriately named ... SWAT.  Its great to provide that quick tactical fix without drowning the gamer in too much detail.Door kickers bring a considerable graphics update, a story mode, and enough variety in the individual scenarios to keep you from getting bored.  The upgrade system is intuitive and easy to work with.The game experiences some difficulty due in part due to some silly AI from both friendly and enemy NPCs but nothing that can't be overcome with micromanagement (shudder...) but that aside the level of control provided is thorough.  It may appear daunting at first but the tutorial provided at the beginning does a great job of explaining the game mechanics. I don't play this game often but thoroughly enjoy the short bursts when I do.  I got this game during the a steam sale for less than $5 at which price the game is a steal.			"

												Well done game. It feels more like a puzzle, yet retains the real time over head combat feel. Officers level up, get injured or KIA, and have fully customizable equipment packages. If you lose an officer in campaign mode the officer is lost for the rest of the campaign, so you really have to plan both short tearm and long term. This game has the ultimate element a true strategy/puzzle gamer craves...ENDLESS PLAYABILITY!!! You can go back to play any of the 100 or so preloaded levels and have a different outcome. With the Steam community and create your own puzzle features the game is never ending. 10/10 for its categories.			"

												Whilst it's good fun to plan your attack the point of doing so is ruined somewhat by the randomness of the game.An entrance that can work twice in a row can fail on the third because the enemies suddenly kill you whereas previuosly they didn't. I'm assuming that this is because they have an element of randoness when they are generated or open fire.In other games this would be fair enough as it keeps the level from becoming too linear however in a game that tries to sell itself on the planning aspect it becomes pretty annoying quite quickly.You can edit the maps to remove the random enemy start points and play each one as a custom map but this means you don't get the progression of characters and equipment etc. that you would playing them normally.Maybe it's just me as I think the game would work much better if it were more like a puzzle game where your planning actually counted for more. I am still recommending it if picked up in a sale.			"

												A tactical game where you take control of a swat team that you can customize with dozens of guns and items. As far as guns go, there are pretty much 4 types, and there's no real incentive to use anything other than the best gun of each type: either the best SMG for close quarters, the best shotgun, the best rifle, or the best silenced weapon. Pistols behave similarly. However, the core strategy experience is deep and addicting. The tutorial is really insufficient to acquaint you with new features of the game, as I was still discovering ""advanced"" controls after 10+ hours.That said, holy fudge, this game is tons of fun. As you start to master the controls, the rush and satisfaction of breaching a door, placing a few well placed bullets into the generic ""terrorists"", and saving the hostages, you'll forget all about any problems. Plus, the game itself comes with a robust level editor, and custom content is worth the price of admission on its own. The game comes (right now) with 120+ individual missions and 6 campaigns. It's a lot of content, and with about 20 hours logged I'm done with the 4 shortest campaigns, and a mere <30 missions. I've unlocked everything except the clearly worse guns, but I'm still playing like there's more to unlock- the game is just that fun.If you like strategy games or are looking for a unique SWAT type sim, listen to the hype- this game is GREAT.

After we move together in the living room. Look again in my pad. Ok Bronson, but I don't think it's so easy like this game show.Charles, we did this many times, don't be a ♥♥♥♥♥.Aye Bronson, but I'm tired to repeat again just to take the 3 starts, I would like to move to the next step with the other guys and the smg.I've understood, let try it once again, ok?OK OK, after all we are getting better, I remember my first time where I need to understand to trow the flash-bang before to break into the room, and we had both only a light jacket and stupid guns. I hope to be ready soon to join the guys in the big campaign.Aye, but you know how that our commander is a dammed control freak, he whats that we reach all the goal to get better resources to equip us. Do you think that I was happy to deal with the 6 terrorist alone last time? I don't give a s**t to ""improve the performance"" or ""get under the national average time, boy"". If he keep doing that I am going to report to the HR office.Definitely he's mad, easy to stay in the office and plan everything on the board, telling do that, after that, wait for A, wait for B... sometimes I haven't enough time to reload, and he wants that I break in a kitchen after a fight against 5 Santos.Pete, liking the right part now he's working as a sniper, easy job, no danger and he doesn't have to help to clean or take the evidences.Silence, he's just finished to plan again, be ready.A, engage! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Charles and Bronson like:- put in pause to update the strategy- select many roles, weapons and equip (well, it depends to the commander strategy)- hold the position and let the other guys go ahead- a good plan- the possibility to coordinate complex actions.Charles and Bronson doesn't like:- censured by the captainThe captain like:- challenges- random situation- a huge quantity of scenarios, to make stronger his position when he will run for the Major seat- be stealth to collect much drugs is possible- be ramboid to collect much macho statusJohn ""Hannibal"" Smith opinion:""I love it when a plan comes together.

												I feel that this is a very good game. I like the game concept and pacing of the missions. The missions are interesting but short enough. The game mechanics are not difficult to learn, but level design and the equipment customization ability allows one to try multiple approaches to complete a mission. With good planning of equipment and paths, the team can complete the actual mission in very short time. There are some things that can be improved. For example, the UI makes it difficult to pick individual team members when they stand very closely together. Path creation UI can also be improved, e.g. to allow easy modification of an early segment without having to redo the rest of the path. The variety of weapons also don't seem to matter so much -- for example, many of rifle choices for assaulter class don't seem to offer distinct advantage compared to e.g. P90 or SAR-18 option. Lastly, it's better if some action options are added, e.g. ability for a team member to look around and clear the room before moving. At the moment, there's only option to look at one direction, confirm that it's clear, move slightly, look at another direction, confirm that it's clear, and so on. Another ability that will come in handy is the ability to synchronize team member to only move after a flashbang (without using go codes), the ability to specify alternate action (e.g. when the door that is supposed to be breached is already opened by someone else), and ability to combine actions on one item during planning (e.g. unlock the door, then throw a flashbang through it).Having said that, those issues are minor, and I still highly recommend this game.

												While the game starts you with very simple missions, the scenarios quickly become more complex and interesting. I found the large variety of weapons and different strengths of the classes really engaging as the game became harder. It's equally fun to try to plan out the entire mission or just individually guide each soldier in real time. My only negatives are some interface issues and slightly too high spread on enemies. Interactions with doors can be clunky and thrown grenades/flashbangs don't always go where you want. Enemies can hit hostages at pretty wide angles at times forcing you to restart. All in all, a really fun little game that quickly starts eating up huge chunks of your time.			"

Mods and player workshop are awesome for this too...adds to the replay value quite a bit.  Definately not worth the asking price, but something to catch on sale.

												I have to say, after 20 hours of playing this game, im still loving it.its a addicting game that punishes you for bad choices and a bad plan.you got to really try with this game, like what had to be done in rainbow six games or SWAT.Game: In this game you take controll of a sqaud of your choice and you can choose exactly everything they use,how they use it, and much more. from a different perspective, its almost like a board game, and you have to look 50 moves ahead. to get new classes, simply play the game! to get new weapons, do the best you can, and earn stars (currency) to get weapons. there are quite a few gamemodes, and each one is thrilling!Extras: there are mods and a level editor.Pros: strategy based game.          fairly balanced.          great gameplay.           alot of different options.           mission generator for random missions.Cons:taser is almost worthless. End: there are some things i missed, but dont worry, this game is great!I would love this game more, if they added more stuning weapons, and made handcuffing everyoneinstead of killing them a challenge it would be much more fun then the game already is. but i feelas though this needs to be added!

 Door Kickers - Good, in a punch your screen kind of way. I quite like Door Kickers, it's a pretty fun tactical game with some basic in reality. I found using realistic tactics really does help complete the missions however that doesn't mean it'll work every time. The game isn't without it's downsides, I often found myself wondering why I was only allowed two SWAT officers to raid a massive building full of hostages but I guess it's supposed to add to the challenge? I first brought this game before the existance of doctrines and when all weapons where free, I found the update to be pleasant to begin with as it gave you something to work towards however again, I soon found myself questioning the logic to it all. Why aren't my officers allowed the tools they need for the job? Why am I taking a sqaud of undertrain and inexperienced officers in to this highly dangerous situation? So yes, the game is damn frustrating at times but that's all part of the experience I suppose. There is nothing quite like trying over and over again to get that perfect run, quick, clean and without injury's. I often found that even if the game made me rage quit I'd be back on it minutes after trying to best myself. If you like tactical games then this is definatly one for you - if you can look past all it's minor annoyances.			"

												Well, I took a chance on a cheap game that had some postitive reviews.  I am glad I did, this game is great, I cant stop playing.  Even when I die over and over, I dont get upset.  I just change my tactics.  I would call this a cross between X-Com, Frozen Synapse and Swat.  You can play in real time, but it is better to stop the action and make your moves first.One thing I really like are the go codes, you can make a swat member approch each door on each side of room the exact same time.  And then you blow it open or kick it in, the terrorist are confused and it is easy to take them out.  I really reccomend this game, I understand you can also play on IOS as well.  But I think that would not be as good as using a mouse and PC.  Get it for PC.   Check out all the positive reviews, there is a reason.			"

												This game is a lot of fun, really easy to play. I enjoy the changes between levels and objectives. The ability to manage and equip your squad with a variety weapons, body armor, and special gear ( flashbang, breaching tools, ect) as well as pick the look of your squad members really helps to make them feel like your very own squad.  I would recommend this game.			"

												Rewardingly and frustratingly difficult. I found myself striving to get five stars on absolutely every mission, going every angle, weapon, and piece of gear to get the perfect combination. Careful planning is generously encouraged since every time I didn't carefully plan ( and a lot of times when I did ) the game would brutally punish and have my whole squad wiped out by one guy in one corner I didn't think I'd need to sweep on entry. With 33 hrs in as of writing this, I still haven't gotten through all the campaign levels, which are unique in approach and scale compared to the shorter missions menu. I tried fiddling with the level builder, and its kind of a pain. Could be more intuitive.If you're a perfectionist, be wary. Also, a less tactics dependant game called breach and clear is pretty good if you end up liking this game.			"

												While the game starts you with very simple missions, the scenarios quickly become more complex and interesting. I found the large variety of weapons and different strengths of the classes really engaging as the game became harder. It's equally fun to try to plan out the entire mission or just individually guide each soldier in real time. My only negatives are some interface issues and slightly too high spread on enemies. Interactions with doors can be clunky and thrown grenades/flashbangs don't always go where you want. Enemies can hit hostages at pretty wide angles at times forcing you to restart. All in all, a really fun little game that quickly starts eating up huge chunks of your time.			"

												If you liked the planning phase of Rainbow Six or SWAT, you owe it to yourself to play this game. You have the opportunity to plot the path of each squad member right down to their actions, aiming direction, pauses, and aggressiveness. You can play any strategy you want and succeed if you're a good enough planner.There are very few negatives about Door Kickers. It is a little shallow in the customization of your squad. Even though there are a lot of kit choices, there are few items that make any sort of difference. Occassionally, the difficulty of a level seems too high, but you always know that it's your fault if you're not succeeding.			"

												I bought this game, because I hate doors.I kept it, because it is a great police tactical game reminding me of the days when I played SWAT.You can do missions in real-time, or pause any time while the action is going, or even turn it into something like a turn based game (where your foe does not respect the rules) and command your team from point to point in your own tempo.You make plans before the action, but you are free to modify it according to the events. Or don't plan, just go in & spray and pray (and fail). Enemies are generated procedurally.Guns, shields, armour, tools, classes, names, portraits, callsigns, all can be customised.+ Drugs, bank robbery, hostage situations are included.			"

												I feel that this is a very good game. I like the game concept and pacing of the missions. The missions are interesting but short enough. The game mechanics are not difficult to learn, but level design and the equipment customization ability allows one to try multiple approaches to complete a mission. With good planning of equipment and paths, the team can complete the actual mission in very short time. There are some things that can be improved. For example, the UI makes it difficult to pick individual team members when they stand very closely together. Path creation UI can also be improved, e.g. to allow easy modification of an early segment without having to redo the rest of the path. The variety of weapons also don't seem to matter so much -- for example, many of rifle choices for assaulter class don't seem to offer distinct advantage compared to e.g. P90 or SAR-18 option. Lastly, it's better if some action options are added, e.g. ability for a team member to look around and clear the room before moving. At the moment, there's only option to look at one direction, confirm that it's clear, move slightly, look at another direction, confirm that it's clear, and so on. Another ability that will come in handy is the ability to synchronize team member to only move after a flashbang (without using go codes), the ability to specify alternate action (e.g. when the door that is supposed to be breached is already opened by someone else), and ability to combine actions on one item during planning (e.g. unlock the door, then throw a flashbang through it).Having said that, those issues are minor, and I still highly recommend this game.

												This is the closest game I could find to be considered a hidden gem. And I think is deserves that title.Take control of a SWAT squad during many different terrorist encounters, thoroughly cleaning out the building by the time your done. Use the many squad members you make in your down time to change your strategy for each level.Most of the time you'll have to save hostages, but you will encounter the occasional bomb, arrest warrent, drug situation, or have to just clean house. As you complete missions, you level your used squad members, not only improving their combat skills, but also giving you doctorine points. Doctorine points being used to upgrade the different classes' effectiveness.You'll meet alot of doors blocking your way along you career. But kicking them down isn't the only option. You can silently open them, loudly flash them, or (still loudly) plant C4 to burst them open. And that's just normal doors. You'll also face locked doors that can't silently be opened, but have to be picked, which will alert enemies close enough to hear it. As you can see, this is were the strategy kicks in. To this day I can hear ""loud?"" ringing in my ears while playing PAYDAY 2. As much as it hurts me to say this so blandly, ""you can go in loud, or sneak in silent."" But I have to cut this guide short before it gets to long.IN SUMMARY: GOOD GAME, BAD PRICE: ""CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN GEM""			"

												Very enjoyable, softcore-tactical, quick to play timesink. I got it on sale but it is easily worth 10 quid.I liked Frozen Synapse, making detailed plans for goons to follow and succeeding in beating enemies down via superior tactics. Unfortunately, Frozen Synapse is pretty hardcore and I enjoy being able to kick back and watch my men act. Feels like Door Kickers jumps right in, neither being too complicated, nor being too simplistic.There are issues with the game that feel a bit annoying, such as flashbangs not going where they're supposed to go (which I know very well from SWAT4), path editing not being meant for complex planning and some minor UI stuff. However, the game feels polished, solid and well-designed.Gameplay is generally bang boom bang, so don't expect too much in terms of policework. You're gunning down dozens of armed guys and usually within a narrow timeframe.If the trailer had you excited, buy this thing. It's well worth it.			"

												Challenging and frustrating tactical and action game with aspects of RPG and equiping your squad with various weapons. The classes are to make line between the styles and the approach how you are going to deal with enemies. Or you want to be quick or armed to teeth, but last unlocked class Stealth says the game is easiest with these guys who are quiet and fast. Being shield is good with support fire, being assaulter is good for quick killing, breacher is important for opening locked doors and there is nothing good with first class unless you want to play light with pistol.I unlocked all skills before approaching campaign which was supposed to be easy so I just ordered my men to go through the map and in second level they started to die. My levelling up was wasted by deaths, and only one of the experienced crew survived the easy and short campaign so yeah, this game is not easy.			"

												Door Kickers is a top down strategy game where you plan out routes for you swat units to take and clear out the baddies.  There's customization, classess, the every slight presence of RPG elements, and robust and rewarding gameplay.But this is a game I am torn on.  On one hand, it is very well made strategic and tactical experience with LOADS of content to keep you busy if you love it. However, even with its varying levels of difficulty and what should be endless costomization options to suit each level, the gameplay gets stale very fast.  Often times, I found myself asking why there were so many levels because they all blend together into this ubiqitous expereince so quickly.  To be clear, I absolutely love the gameplay and all of the ideas that are brought to the table, but it is needlessly big.  It's like going to see a movie that has a lot of good stuff but it goes on an hour too long.  Now in videogames, that shouldn't be a problem, you just don't play the extra stuff, but here's the rub:  you are paying for it.The $20 price tag is my only issue with the game.  Other than that, it's perfect for a quick play every now and then and delivers all that it should.  If you like strategy games and it's on sale for say, $10 I highly recommend it, but there isn't enough here to justify the 20 dollar tag.			"

Excellent if you've got friends into 9D chess/loadout geeking.On iPad, I've found this to be an amazing party game when buzzed. Cheering on virtual SWAT dudes was never so much fun before.Easily one of my top games played of all time. 420/42 would *accidentally* flashbang hostages again.			"

												This is an entertaining little casual strategy game. It's a bit like Frozen Synapse, but without turns. Instead, you have the ability to control one of your team at a time in real time (not generally recommended but sometimes it's just more convenient) or pausing and drawing up a detailed plan.For planning you drag a footpath, and set waypoints. Waypoints occur any time you want to do something other than keep walking. For example, you can change or lock facing, hold position and fire until your cone of sight is clear, toss a flashbang, perform some form of breaching maneuver, or collect evidence. You can also set up to four 'hold' points--very useful for keeping all your team working in unison.In the beginning, you'll probably use none of that and just drag your squad members around, but if you want the best results, you'll learn to use and execute plans. It's much easier to clear a house with a team working simultaneously like a tidal way flowing through it, each member clearing their sector and relying on their teammates to do the same, than it is to try and move them one at time, no matter how good your leapfrogging skills are.In a sense, the midgame moves from a strategy game to more of a puzzle feel. This is becuase once a map is generated, it remains the same, so you can grind on it until you get a plan that works as well as you want it to. It's a very satisfying feeling when you get a multistage plan to clear a building and can do it all in one go, triggering phases as you go. A skilled player will spend the bulk of their time in planning mode. A masterful player will not only spend most of their time in planning mode, they'll only use it once at the beggining of the mission.It feels like it was ported from a tablet game. The biggest reason it feels like that is that all levels are on a single screen--though some missions have multiple levels (floors). This means that no matter how big a level is, there's no scrolling around the map, and no need for a mini-map. It's all handled by scaling the sprites instead, so that on a simple small map, everthing is bigger, and on the largest maps, everything gets a bit small, and there is no option to zoom in. That can make certain forms of breaching a door more difficult to plot because sometimes waypoints will end up so close together it's hard to get the right one. This mainly happens to me when using a shieldbearer to kick down a door, take a step into a small room that's probably empty anyway, and back out. It can be done, but sometimes it's a bit fussy to get it done.The structure of the game is a bit odd. You are forced to grind a bit at the beginning on single missions before campaign mode unlocks. This works in your favour though, as the prescripted single missions gradually increase in difficulty, but don't penalize you if someone get injured or killed during the mission. In a campaign mission, the injured require time to heal, and dead remain dead--though it's completely up to you whether or not you want to accept those results or not. You can always choose to restart the level and try again.Your plan will remain intact by default, and you can tweak it so it works better.Tweaking a plan is where the game falls on it's face the most. Some adjustments can be made cleanly, but others will wipe out every step past the adjustment. Further, some waypoints are harder to revise than others for no discernable reason. Chiefly, if you have a waypoint to wait for a signal to continue, you can't delete that waypoint until you toggle the signal at that waypoint off.To clarify, lets say you have a plan laid out and at a certain point you want a member of your team to wait for an ""alpha"" command. This would mean that they would execute every command up until that waypoint, and then hold position until you hit the ""A"" or ""1"" key. This would be done by right-clicking the waypoint, and clicking the ""A"" button on the submenu. Every other command on the submenu can be wiped out by deleting a waypoint, but a waypoint to wait for a trigger like that cannot be deleted (in spite of being able to right click it and select ""Delete Waypoint"") unless you first right click it and click the ""A"" on the submenu again.It can be frustrating if you haven't figured that out--and it's something the game does not tell you.The upgrading system is a bit of a joke. As you do missions, your team will rank up, and once your team has ranked up enough, new jobs and campaigns become available. Further, as you complete missions you earn stars to use to unlock new guns and equipment. But XP and stars are easy to grind for thanks to a very simple random mission generator that gives out more or less the same rewards, regardless of the actual difficulty of the mission--at least as far as stars are concerned. No mission yields more than three stars, no matter how difficult or complex the map. This means you can grind through maps containing one or two small rooms, stuffed with easy targets and three star them every time with very little effort. In an hour or so, you should be able to unlock all the jobs, and all the equipment you find interesting.There is also a sort of ""talent tree"" called doctrines. As your team levels, you gain points to spend, but there really aren't that many things to spend them on, and they're all or nothing, so in the same time you unlock all the jobs and all the equipment you want, you can complete the entire doctrine tree. It's busywork more than an accomplishment.There are also some menu... quirks. If you watch a replay, the only way to get back to selecting missions is to back out to the main menu again. This isn't that big of a problem though, because after a couple replays, you won't use that function very often.The replay function has two significant flaws beyond the menu issue. The first is that to watch a replay is to save it--there is no choice in the matter. The second is that there is no apparent way to watch the replay without the plan marks. I don't want to see my waypoints in the replay, I just want to watch my team flow through an enemy stronghold like a force of nature. That isn't an option, which cuts into the uh... replay value of the replay feature.It's not a AAA game, and it isn't trying to be. But for what it is, it's satisfying (provided you aren't paying full price). I didn't (and wouldn't) pay $20 for it. I wouldn't be happy if I'd paid more than about $10.  It's not a bad game, just overpriced IMSO.			"

												Absolutely one of the most precious gem on independent development that went on steam.Very engaging from various different levels of approach the user can have. From being very casual to very demanding into preparing the mission and execution of each one of your squad members and gear.It has a very interesting mission generator with randomization and vast range of mission sizes.Although not incredibly complex, mission planning can get a little problematic if you make messy paths on planning, especialy if you want to change anything in the middle of a furball that player can make with paths and orders.Despite some problems this is the most tactical a simple game have been from a long time without getting into mil sims.To anyone that have played the first Rainbow Six series and Swat series of games I totally recommend this.

												What an amazing Tactical Shooter.Basically, you plan the route of your team like a professional SWAT team and then hope that your plan won't get your officers killed. You can also do it on the run instead of planning but you would be missing the point of the game.My only complain about the game is when you have bigger maps / bigger teams it gets chaotic to re-arrange a plan after you found an issue with it because of the overlapping paths which are hard to select the one you want to re-adjust.Still, one of my favourite games.11/10 - Enemy Down!
