												[7.7/10]The weirdest simulation games ever !Step into the rubber soled shoes of the hapless janitor tasked with cleaning up Santa's mess after a devastating battle in the santa's workshop. you have your bucket to wipe off the blood, gloves and incinerators to deal with the chunkier bits.It’s not as dumb as you’d imagine. It has that odd satisfaction of a job well done.ohh...you can even enlist some friends to come and help you clean up... or make even more mess !			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Simulation; Casual; Comedy; First-Person; Gore   My Overall Grade: B Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 3-9 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Novelty seekers; Casual gamersREVIEWViscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage is a funny, simple game that shouldn’t be taken seriously.  It is a “simulator” style game with purposefully “silly” controls and movement.  It is the kind of game where there isn’t much to it, but it is fun while it lasts.  Expect a handful of hours of playtime.There is only one map and it is pretty small, but is actually perfectly sized.  It is designed well; big enough that you can enjoy looking around without it being too big that things get boring trying to clean.  The amount of time it takes to actually beat the campaign (read: finish cleaning everything) is just enough to be substantial without getting too tedious— 1 to 2 hours.  The game still might get a little tedious if you are going for all the achievements.For the most part, though, it is pretty damn entertaining.  As you look around at the mess that you are cleaning, you’ll notice that it tells the story of what happened.  It is very amusing. There are several little Easter eggs and such as well.It has multiplayer where you can connect directly to a friend.  The game would definitely be more fun to play with someone than alone.  I feel this is a kind of game that would have greatly benefitted from old school local multiplayer.  I feel like it would be fun to sit on a couch with your significant-lover or a buddy and play a stupid game like this.  Perhaps it will be added at a future date from when I wrote this.Ultimately, though, don’t expect too much.  You’ll get an amusing couple of hours, maybe a bit more if you bring a friend and/or unlock the achievements.  After that, you will never play it again.  Of course, Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage is also probably best enjoyed around the holidays, as it is extra comical when juxtaposed with all the real holiday spirit you will be exposed to in real life.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												""What is Santa´s Rampage?""""Well, let me tell you children... It is a game about cleaning..... Sounds boring? Nooo... this is a game about cleaning up blood, viscera, bodyparts and other nasty stuff.... Did i get ure attention?! GOOD, now listen!""The StorySantas had enough after year after year handing out presents to little ungrateful children (Yeah im talking about YOU!), and blows a serious gasket and goes on a rampage and kills everybody in santas workshop, and vanishes without a trace.The MissionYou are a janitor hired to clean up this mess. So what are u waiting for?! Get going! Pros- You never have this much fun cleaning.- Fun to clean with ure mates (If u get it working, havent tried mp on this game)- Nice ""christmasy"" graphicsCons- Some glitches can accur with objects spazzing out.- Some achivements can be a pain to get. (There are guides though.)Personal ThoughtsId say this is the best christmas game out there that i have played. Its relaxing in a weird way to mop up blood, throw dead elf bodies in the open fire, or just havning a blast with the dynamite blowing ♥♥♥♥ up ;)Get this game for christmas now!			"

												Just like the Shadow Warrior version this Viscera game also contains only one level but it is quite unique and overall a bit funnier than the factory or space station levels in the vanilla game.Santa has gone crazy and got rid of his elves and now it is up to you to clean up the mess! Funny how you can create an even bigger mess by not being careful and throwing dynamite into the fireplace. The flying debris results in ash everywhere and this time you also need to clean up some liquor Santa left after some heavy drinking.It is a short game but the achievements can make it last a little bit longer. It is a must for all the Viscera fans out there!			"

												First of all, this is not a long game.  It is, however, entertaining for the content it does have.  If you've ever heard the Weird Al song ""The Night Santa Went Crazy,"" this videogame explores the aftermath.  Based on the Viscera Cleanup Detail series of games, instead of being set in a typical video game world (""Space Janitors!""), this one takes place in Santa's Workshop, where you play the one elf who appears to have stayed home the night before.  The rest your fellow toymakers can be found strewn about the workshop in various pieces.  Santa's Rampage has left no survivors, (no, not even the reindeer), and it's up to you to clean up the mess.Your job here is to mop up the spills and smears of blood, pick up and dispose of any inappropriate objects and generally return the workshop to it's original state, as much as possible, given that at least one door was blown off its hinges.  Gameplay is fairly simple, though sometimes a bit wonky in the controls.  You get a mop, a ""mess detector"" and a pair of gloves.  You can also pick up buckets of water or biohazard bins to help in the cleanup.  You use the mop to wipe up the mess, then dunk the dirty mop into a clean bucket of water, cleaning the mop, but eventually dirtying the water.  Disposal of waste is handled in the most efficient manner possible: the fireplace, of course,   Care must be taken because some objects are more volatile than others, and disposing of them in the fireplace can be hazardous to your health.   But a steady hand, and lots of patience will see you through the game.It's not high entertainment by any stretch of the imagination, but for an hour or so of laughing every time you pick up a mangled elf corpse (""Fritz!  He killed Fritz!  That lousy, stinking, pot-bellied slave-driver! That despicable animal toy-monger!""), nothing beats Santa's Rampage.			"

												It's cheap, yet gives quite a refreshing experience.Basically, Santa got mad and terrorized everyone in the workshop, and you are here to clean up. The game isn't violent, it's just that it's very bloody.The whole process takes about 1.5 - 2 hrs (at least on your first try).You will have to get rid of the bodies (by burning), then wipe away the blood and get rid of all the broken stuff, then a bit of layout adjustment.You might be thinking that it is too repetitive and will become boring, but in fact it isn't like that at all.One really impressive thing is the sense of completion this game gives you. If you step on the blood you will leave footprints, that's why you are most likely to clean areas bit by bit. You really feel how the place changes around you. There is also coop in this game.I am dead serious. No joke. Give this game a try. This game itself is a short demo to their upcoming game that is set in a space station (with numerous levels to choose from). The is also another demo which features the first level of the newly released Shadow Warrior remake, but personally, i think this is a better version.Also, it costs about 2$.			"

Ho ho ho I chopped some elvesRating: OkSanta's had bad a bad day and unloaded his guns on his elves. You have to clean up the mess after he left to deliver some packages. Pretty funny game in the Viscera's series. Fun for a while but it soon gets a bit boring. As you are a lot of time in the same space and virtually nothing happens other than you wiping the floor. The handling of all the stuff is a bit cluncky so you now and then kick your own bucket and you can start over again. Like the real life of a janitor I suppose. One annoying thing to mention is that you cannot save the game so if you want to clean the whole place you better reserve some time. You also don't have an indication about your progress other than the stuff you don't see anymore. The 'real' game is still in alpha so i guess this 'by-product' shows the state of the game at the moment. Fun for a little while.			"

												I spent two hours cleaning up, only to spend another hour looking for the last christmas decoration that fell behind the bookshelf......and in the game.Viscera Cleanup Detail see's you play the role of Janitor to the gruesome aftermath of Santa's breakdown at his Workshop. You'll rush around, cleaning up what is left of his little elf helpers with the help of very wriggly mop and some high tech cleaning gizmo's.While it's not something I'll likely return to as the layout of the gruesome aftermath of Santa's rampage doesn't seem to change, the game kept me hooked cleaning up (and burning everything) I could find.I can't actually believe how well it kept my attention, because of that, I think it gets a recommendation for those type of gamers who enjoy hunting down secrets, stealing everything in sight or obsessively cleaning!

Make the Ravioli dough.- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

═══════════════════════════════════OVERVIEWViscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage is a first-person janitor simulator... yes, you heard me, janitor simulator. Viscera Cleanup Detail games are pretty fun, each has their own unique story like this one; drunk Santa went on a rampage, killing elves and trashing his workshop with dynamites because he got tired of everything, this is clearly a GOTY material. Jokes aside, I had fun with this game, graphics are nice, there are a lot of easter eggs, hard and funny achievements and other cool stuff you can experiment with.═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONSPros:Makes cleaning funAwesome graphicsCleaning mechanicsDon't want to spoil it, but there's dynamite tooCons:Too shortOnly 1 areaSome achievements are annoying to doNot suitable for children═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATINGThis game is for everyone that wants to clean take a break from shooters while still playing something violent. I rate the game 8/10, would get stuck on the tiny elf body holding a NERF gun again!═══════════════════════════════════For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!

												As someone that hates cleaning in real life, this game is very Zen to play for some reason, possibly because I'm OCD... Unless you play with friends then it can be a damn nightmare depending if you want screw around. This fun little standalone game only contains the one map, but for the low price you can't complain. You must clean the mess after a rampaging Santa and save/ruin Christmas for everyone. There is lots of little things in this game that make it funny and allow you to piece together the tragic story together on what you think happened. Lots of little notes you can pick up and read, reading the books on the shelf, as well as just looking at how the elf corpses are scattered around the map... Or blowing up yourself and your friend with the TNT found in the map.Not really a whole lot to explain, other than look up some videos and screenshots. If it looks interesting to you then give it a try, otherwise you may not enjoy it.Pros:- Short little game.- Funny humor.- Coop- Cheap price point.- Easy achievements. (Only took me 5 hours to 100%)Cons:- Game can be a little glitchy sometimes with the physics, even more so if you play online and experience any high ping with people.- Will always be the same map, nothing changes game to game.- No Steam Cards.Good buy for the price, and enjoyable to play with friends, would recommend it!

												First time in, I threw some dynamite into the fireplace and ended up mesmerised by the fuse burning down, then I ended up all over the walls...Second time in, I ""accidentally"" threw a molotov cocktail into a room where I had been storing all the dynamite...you know, just to see what would happen...I ended up on the walls again...Third time in I think I broke the water-bucket dispenser so I ended up washing the floors and walls with elf blood which was surprisingly NOT green...Fourth time in I kinda lost track of time reading all Santa's letters...he's been a VERY bad boy!Maybe one day I'll get the whole place clean, until then I think I'll just keep trying to blow everything up...Santa/10 would have a psychotic break again			"

												After playing this game I went over to my brothers room, grabbed him by the chest, dragged him downstairs into the living room furnace. I held him as he burned and as the flesh of his guts flew over my hands, his intestine on the ground, and his lower left leg was completely scorched. I continued this event to each and everyone of my family members. They are all dead now and I am currently trying to clean up my house. This is by far one of the best games I have ever played in my life. Thank you.			"

Endless requests from greedy children wanting more and more every year, tax increases, pressure from elf unions, bills, reindeer! I was surprised i could run this in the first place because this game needed AMD Radeon HD 3870 and i had ATI Radeon HD 2400 PRO but it was a christmas miracle and i could run it smoothly, this game is fantastic, the graphics and everything.

												I got this game for 2 dollars 50 new zealand.The small pricetag normally keeps me away from games. But this one caught my eye. The title ""santas rampage"" sold it for me. And the title doesn't lie. I found myself cleaning up.... what can I say, Santa's rampage. It's a fun game that doesn't take too long. It's a good laugh for people who want it and it has it's consistancy for people who want to actually clean up everything. I'd have to give this game a 7/10.

												..I played this while watching twitch to scratch my Christmas itch (ahem)..If you like to play games as a bit of a completionist and taking your time - and seeing your progress gives you a little buzz, then this is a strangely addictive way to spend a few hours. It IS based on a game in alpha/beta status, and the devs have said basically that ""things go wrong"" in that items (mostly swords & stuff) can glitch into the floor. I had one item I couldn't reach and two more that were reached with the console command to remove 'dirty' items (supported by the devs for this exact reason). Otherwise you would have to be VERY careful during your play-through and restart if any items fell into the world, as you enter and leave your 'job' – no saving.A couple of the achievements are going to be utterly infuriating if you want to 100% it so perhaps pass it over if that's your thing until it's fixed. Yes, it's super simple. Yes it's not for everyone.. But I seriously.. really loved playing it & for less than £2 it was a good way to spend an evening, even if slightly masochistic.			"

												Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage is a cleaning simulator that has you going around and cleaning the aftermath of Santa's descent into elf murdering madness. How much destruction can a jolly old man cause you may be wondering? Well to put it lightly Santa put quite a bit of his free time into knife throwing lessons and has adorned the walls with bloody elf corpses. Limbs are everywhere, the rooms are smeared with blood and Santa even had to nerve to hide a few bodies as to avoid being charged with 100 murders because anything more than 99 is just barbaric. A nice little detail is that searching Santa's office will fill you in as to why he went postal and feel a bit sympathetic for the fat man until you realize that you stepped on some blood and created footprints all the way from the hall. It was around this point that I remembered I was a janitor, not a detective so I went on my merry way to get a bucket of water from this rather odd machine built solely to dispense buckets of water. Back into the room I go, I set down the bucket and turn back only to see a new set of footprints have been made on my way over here.I clean and I clean until my mop starts making more of a bloody mess instead of cleaning any of it and I try to clean my mop in the bucket. As it turns out you have to be at just the right place to dunk it in water but foolish old me just started trying different buttons and ended up smacking the bucket right into Santa's desk and knocking over his whiskey bottles straight to the floor. So out I go to get another bucket of water and the machine plops out a raw hunk of bloody meat dirtying up the area even more. It is at this point that I slowly nod to myself, go back into Santa's office and threw a stack of TNT into the fireplace out of spite. I then left the job site and into the night as I started to realize this wasn't too bright. As you can imagine my boss was more than displeased and this good ole janitor was fired on Christmas Eve. Er, poor Christmas rhymes aside this is one title where you will want to pay attention as the slightest slip up can make the room messy again. As this game also features online coop this will be the perfect title to either work as a team or get them to hate you and your clumsiness.Cleaning is a very time consuming process in this game. Your mop gets dirty and so does the bucket eventually, making you walk all the way back to get another one. Corpses are your biggest concerns as whenever you pick them up and accidentally bump them into something, blood splatters onto the surface of the area. The elves never run out of blood oddly enough so there is no limit to the amount of mess a single corpse can create. At first I simply stuck them into containers but they quickly all filled to the brim. I eyed the fireplace and as it turns out you are actually supposed to cremate them in there. It's not just the corpses and blood you must clean. You are supposed to burn everything from corpses, antlers, whiskey bottles and Santa's guns. If the cheery Christmas melodies start getting on your nerves you can simply toss the jukebox into the fire as well. Even the buckets with the bloody water must be burned. Everything must be burned and the fireplace can be quite some ways from where the mess is so you can stuff them into your giant storage box and carry them back. It would be far easier to simply burn the house down but oh well, that's the life of an underpaid janitor I suppose.As you can no doubt tell by now this game is rather morbid and filled with dark humor. You don't even have to work if you don't want to, you can just toss elf corpse onto the table like if this was a wrestling game. Toss bottles, paint the room red with your bloody mop and stacking all the bodies near the entrance so however enters has one heck of a surprise are some of the things you can have fun with if you are not a cleaning kind of person. There is no price or anything other than achievements for cleaning so there is no real point for doing so unless you are really dedicated to your role of janitor. Only one map to explore and nothing to unlock so what you see is what you get. If you are taking the game seriously and are actually cleaning it should take you a bit over 2 hours to fully clean it if you are by yourself. It is quite a graphic intensive game due to all the objects that you can manipulate and looks pretty good as well however it is a fairly small map. All in all it is a rather enjoyable cleaning game with enough freedom to be able to easily get some decent entertainment for the price. It's not a game I find all to enjoyable personally but if you are in the market for a cleaning game based on the great elf massacre that drove Santa into being a dangerous fugitive then this is the game for you!

												I played this off the back of watching a film by the name of ""Sunshine Cleaning"", it's a charming yarn about a pair of sisters played by Amy Adams and Emily Blunt. One sister (Adams) is a smart determined single mother gritting it out as a cleaner to support a slightly problematic child whilst at the same time fitting in an affair with a married man who has absolutely no respect for himself, Adams or his pregnant wife!!....the other (Blunt) is caught half way between being a dreamer and a screw up. To cut a long story short out of necessity they form a crime scene cleaning company by the name of Sunshine Cleaning, burn down a house and decimate family relationships only to build them back up again.Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Revenge doesn't feature Amy Adams or Emily Blunt, it doesn't even feature Alan Arkin as a slightly potty father selling popcorn out of the back of a sedan one week then struggling to shift seafood lovingly preserved in his bathtub the next....it did however teach me one thing, which is that this crime scene cleaning lark isn't for me.Upon entering the grotto the game advise's me that Santa has had a break down and went ballistic with a shotgun. Elves are scattered everywhere, limbs are scattered everywhere, the walls and carpets are painted red. I spent 20 minutes walking around in circles following bloody footprints only to realise that they were my own as I'd stepped on an Elve's head when entering the grotto....this is a far cry from getting the hoover out on a Sunday afternoon and following it up with some light dusting and a few sprays of anti-bac surface cleaner. Every few mop strokes im having to ring it out in the water bucket, every few minutes im forced to freshen up the water in the bucket, it's feels like a job and for that the developers deserve massive praise.""Sunshine Cleaning"" 8/10 - Amy Adams shines in a touching drama about love, life & family.

												Top fun game. What makes this game even better is that it has coop so you can do it with friends. There are many nice little features within the game, like TNT, molotovs and yes these do blow up. Knives you throw at friends etc. There's are many little things in the game that makes it amazing. The audio is pretty simple with squash squash, bam bam sounds when using wet mops, buckets etc.The controls are really simple, literally really simple and you cannot complain.The mechanics of the game are even simpler... Tidy and use your head about it.  You do not use a bloody bucket to clean a floor do you.... It makes more mess.The coop really sets the game apart... Cleaning together and accidently knocking your friends bucket which is full of blood and whatever making it all messy and more mess, shooting at each other etc, top funIt is stupid cheap which is a perfect buy. I brought this and then brought the official game in space station for $7 and got a free key of this game so I would say go to the website and preorder the official space station version and you get a steam key for both this game and the one coming out. The graphics are actually pretty decent which surprised me. Worth a buy and play.			"

												This game is so amazing that I couldn't think of what I would be doing around Christmas every year, it's been there for me when I have been extremely bored, and this game is not the usual type I'd play. It's a physics interactivity type game, you're cleaning up after Santa's rampage, where all of the elves are dead. It's a huge mess, so it's going to require a lot of time to clean. Not only that, but they still release really awesome updates, 3 years later after its release, and I'm loving all the new features they've been working on.What makes this game all the more amazing, is that the creator(s) haven't left this game yet, they still put love and time into it, and that's pretty much why I enjoy playing it every year, like I don't remember how all the last times went.If you like a game where your job is to clean an entire building, then this game is for you!

												This game is an odd concept that is delivered remarkably well; sick and funny in equal parts, both disturbing and satisfying. I cannot deny that it is calming to clean up after Santa lost his rag, but I feel that this won’t apply to everyone. This makes it a hard game to grade, for those who enjoy salivating the cleaning urge it will like scratching an internal itch; if the concept doesn’t grab you, it will feel like a waste of time. As long as you know what you are going into, I think you can have a lot of fun with this game; it would be nice to have a progress bar though.			"

												Now this is bizarre. Instead of being the hellraiser, you're the cleaner. In this game, you clean up messes. Yeah.This is the third Viscera Cleanup Detail. There's the Shadow Warrior one, which came with the base game. You clean up the bodies Lo Wang left behind. Then there's the original Viscera Cleanup Detail, where you clean up the mess a generic space marine left behind when he was having all the fun. Now, you're cleaning up a mess Santa made. The mess where he murdered all of his elves.The gameplay is simple enough. You get a mop, and a blood detector. Your goal is to clean up the blood, and get rid of all harmful items. A water bucket and a disposal bin are also included in your arsenal of cleanliness. You need to dispose of the dead bodies, shattered whiskey bottles, and so on. The only real hazards in this game are the TNT around that can blow up, and the fact that you can make more blood with footsteps and your dirty mop, which needs frequent cleaning. It's simple, but hey, the game's cheap, and is always being updated. It's a clever idea, executed very well. It definitely won't cater to everyone's tastes, but it is a fun time waster. If you like to clean, you're gonna have a field day with this one.			"

												Worth the $2, but you need to know what you are going to get.  This is more like a small level of a larger game.  Don't go in expecting something complex, but rather light and goofy yet still challenging.I suspect the co-op play is far more fun than single player, making the job more challenging and funny as you stumble into each other.  The co-op play works similar to Terraria where you have to forward port 7777 on your router.Keeo in mind that this *is* a level of a larger game that is in Alpha.  This makes it buggy, especially for the person logging onto the host.  Over time, she couldnt see me, her hands, mop and other items.  Eventually she couldnt interact with anything at all. And since there is no save option, this made completing the game difficult.  The dev has said that the co-op mode is still indevelopment and to expect things like this.And lastly, there are some game breaking bugs: some items fall through the floor preventing you from completing the game and getting certain achievements.  the good news is there are cheats to get by this:Go into the console (tilde key)type ""Ghost"" this will allow you to fly through objects, like the floorIf you can not grab the object, type ""killnearestmess""This should help you get by some of the bugs.To see what co-op gameplay is like, check it out here:

												This is one of those odd games you just wouldn't expect to be any good (a game about cleaning, seriouslely?), yet somehow it turns out to be strangely relaxing. Little Inferno was the same. If you're keen, I'd suggest pre-ordering the main game which will give you this one as well.If you aren't sure if it's your kind of game, go buy the Shadow Warrior reboot - not only is that one of the best games of the year and one of the best shooters/swordplay games of all time, you also get a free copy of the Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior spin-off which will give you an idea of what this game is all about.

The Main PlotVarious notes and letters can be found in the workshop and office, implying that prior to the player's role in Santa's Rampage, Santa Claus had been under large amounts of stress from unpaid bills, outrageous requests from children, elf union strikes, and even threats. Santa subsequently snapped under the pressure, purchasing several crates of 12-gauge shotgun rounds, steak knives, and dynamite sticks, and fashioning several makeshift molotov cocktails (likely under the influence of alcohol). Santa then went on a murder spree, mutilating several elves and reindeer, and destroyed parts of his workshop in the process. He left the scene through unknown means.After these events, the company ""Polar Sanitation Co."" employed the player and sent them to clean the workshop, where the player's role in Santa's Rampage begins.For the ending of my review i can say that the developers did not do the normal online game, where each can play with friends or just a stranger who finds your game.

The amount of laugh's and shocks I had for 2 bucks makes this game well worth the almost absurdly small pricetag. I highly reccommend this little gem.Heres my gameplay if you want a laugh

 Summarized Review Viscera Cleanup Detail is a great game.I Recommend this game.9/10 Full Review Just by watching the trailer, you know what you're getting yourself into.You're cleaning up dead elven entrails, nuf said.As a game made on the Unreal engine, the game itself is amazing.The graphics are better than those in skyrim, and the same thing goes for the ingame physics.On your own, this should take you about three hours to completely clean (give or take ten minutes cleaning up every time a dismembered body part flops out of your bucket dispenser).About half of the three hours you spend cleaning will be spent on stacking buckets to create a horribly engineered ladderto the clean the blood and smashed christmas ornaments off the roof.You will spend one hour cleaning blood and burning bodies, then the last half-hour trying to find a small chunk of elf flesh that has fallen behind santa's desk.If you play with friends however, this job should take just a fraction of the time you did it on your own. right?Wrong.While you try to clean, one or more of your friends will make a bigger mess by using Santa's TNT to blow you and himself up. I'm looking at you bob..That ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gery aside. I rate this game 9/10 "

												I love the concept of the game and I love the graphics. This game had it all to be pure gold, but unfortunately I cannot recommend this at the present time. The amount and severity of bugs make the game not enjoyable at all. Invisible dirt spots, objects getting stuck in corners or under the floor, movement glitches, janitor's box glitching in several and disastrous ways, fireplace not destroying some items no matter how long they're kept in (had to re-insert them to make it work), items going trough the buckets and disposable bins, itens flying violently all over the place when a laid down bin is put in the right position... I could also list some refinements that make gameplay better, but these glitches and bugs are way more important, and they're not being addressed so a list of improvements is unnecessary. Conclusion: Do not buy it no matter how cheap you find it.			"

												A new take on FPS games where you're cleaning up the mess the hero has left after a big battle. In this case, it's Santa going on a rampage in his workshop. There are elf heads rolling around, shotgun cartridges lying about, and a certain red-nosed reindeer is in several pieces. Not one for the kids, but something fun to play at Christmas time.			"

												This game is both soothing and amazingly enraging at the same time. There is something calming about cleaning up the destruction of others, but as soon as you accidentally bump an elf head into the freshly cleaned wall which results in even more splattered blood, then you start seeing red (no pun intended). I wanted to go on a murderous rampage myself after finding out, no, leaving the game through the pause menu instead of the check out computer doesn't actually save the game. If you need to go out and get something while playing this, just leave the game running and hope it doesn't crash (it did, the second time I tried cleaning - so much rage). Hours. Hours of careful, meticulous cleaning and hoarding of elf heads wasted without even praise. It was ♥♥♥♥ing bull ♥♥♥♥.But still. This game is awesome and exactly what I needed after the festive season. Play this if you want to know what it feels like to have your meds fail on you.			"

												This was a very intresting game for me. Most of the games realeased now-adays are you enter a room, kill everyone, and leave. But this game brings a new perspective to that. Instead it places you in the position of someone who has to CLEAN up that bloody room. When you first start playing it seems like it has little promise for fun. But then it kinda grows on you that its actuallly a very ""Intressting"" and fun game. There's no thrill of combat, but there is enjoyment. And for $2.00 you can't really go wrong. If you think it looks compelling to you, then GO FOR IT, it is a very, again ""Intressting"" experience.			"

												After 9 hours of playing and getting 100% of the achivements, I feel It's fair I put in my two cents about the game. Pros: (In no order)Never encounted one bugFun graphics Witty textPoses a fair amount of challenge Flawless gameplay Speed Run gamemode Cons:  (In no order)Somtimes must use console to get items that fall behind desks/containers Very short To dark/bright in some areas Tower of Bable achievement can be frustratingTL:DR VersionI bought the game during the Steam 2015 Holiday Sale for $1.24. The game is just a silly little standalone in the North Pole where you clean up Ol' St. Nicks slaughter of his dear workers. A great game to just pass the time with I can recommend this to anyone that wants some cheap fun. Game is completly flawless.Now for something a little more in depth.Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's RampageSanta's Rampage is a standalone of the full Viscera Cleanup Deatail. In this version you head up to the North Pole and visit Santa's Workshop. Santa has put up with his Elves long enough and has gone postal with his knives and boomstick. You gain entrance to Santa's Workshop just to be greeted with the festering corpses of Elves as well as his Reindeer. It is your job as the janitor to clean up this mess and decided the fate of Christmas. With mop in hand you go on a gut wrenching cleaning frenzy, mopping up Elf guts to properly disposing of expolsives (or not). I really had a blast collecting various toys and stacking stools (Harder than you may think) to get the 13 achivements this game has to offer. Viscera Cleanup also offers a local or online co-op mode so you can even mop with your friends. If you have an extra few dollars in your Steam Wallet I say go ahead and pick this up and give it a go, it's a good time passer.10/10 Would collect decapited Elf heads and take them back to the office again.Feel free to message me if you have questions about the review/gameThanks for reading,MonkeyWrench			"

And for the cost of only £1.798/10- Fun to play multiplayer.- Entertaining to blow stuff up.If you have any spare money, you should totally check this out.			"

												From watching the video on the page of this game, you think ""Wow what a stupid game who could stick to this?"" and oddly enough after buying this game you become strangely addicted to it. I've spent a few hours just playing it different ways to find better, more efficient ways to clean everything up. Quite frankly, I love it.			"

												This was a very intresting game for me. Most of the games realeased now-adays are you enter a room, kill everyone, and leave. But this game brings a new perspective to that. Instead it places you in the position of someone who has to CLEAN up that bloody room. When you first start playing it seems like it has little promise for fun. But then it kinda grows on you that its actuallly a very ""Intressting"" and fun game. There's no thrill of combat, but there is enjoyment. And for $2.00 you can't really go wrong. If you think it looks compelling to you, then GO FOR IT, it is a very, again ""Intressting"" experience.			"

												So I heard about this game from a Youtuber. I looked fun and entertaining. Clean up the mess of what Santa has done to his workers. Sound cool, right...? YES! This is a super fun game that would not sound so cool on paper, cleaning up santa's workshop, not that fun sounding. But as a game this is something worth cheaking out. at 2.50 you can't go wrong with this. But if you want to see I you might like this game or not you can go to the website and download the alpha version of the full game. for me I kinda like this one better maybe cause it's not as big as the full one so less time to spend cleaning.  I realy like this game I recomend you check it out. You might not put to much time into it playing it solo but you can alway try multiplayer.			"

Not the most interesting game seeing how you only clean/ make a mess, and there is only one map in this game, but it is not bad. I enjoyed this game and it is worth your money and since it is only two dollars, it is a very good buy.			"

												It is pretty fun, pretty cheap, and very replayable. Maybe just a teensy bit disturbing at first. The cons- It has some glitches that you can work around with commands. Also, it doesn't have a save feature as of yet so you need to have a block of time free to play or leave it running if you have interuptions.  The inability to save would be my biggest complaint.The pros- burning everything. Smashing ornaments. Blowing yourself up. Shaking dead elves after a rough day. Seeing how dirty you can make it or how clean.  While I haven't tried playing with others yet I think that it would be pretty fun.  Playing by yourself takes a pretty long time for a complete clean up.			"

												It's what you think it is.  You pick up body parts and throw them in a fire, then you mop up the blood from the area, then you go rinse out your mop because now it's all bloody.  Over and over, this is what you do.It's not a good game, but it's not bad either.  The core mechanics aren't hard--you pick up body parts, and clean up blood.  Sometimes you dispose of weapons or broken furniture.But there's a challenge to doing things optimally.  Do you bring a bucket to a spill or just clean up the spill and then come back to your bucket?  You can drop body parts or walk through pools of blood creating more mess that you're just going to have to clean up.  So it pays to be vigilant.There's some humor, especially in the areas that you're set to clean.  It's a lot about exploration (finding corpses in weird places under floorboards, on tops of bookshelves, with knives through their chest and pinned to a wall).  The areas would be less fun to clean a second time, but then there's achievements such as collecting all the money in a level or leaving it spotless (a hard task to accomplish).At the end of the day you'll really just doing something mindless and repetitious, and if it were hard it wouldn't be fun at all.

The cool thing is, is the multiplayer feature, so you can clean with your friends!!! Great game, never stops being fun.			"

If you have full blown OCD, this game will cure you BECAUSE THERE'S NO ♥♥♥♥ING WAY TO GET IT PERFECT!!!I've been cleaning up santas workshop for what seemed to be hours. Finally i got the place all clean with the exception of biohazard bins everywhere. I felt like my job had been complete, so i go to clock out and wouldn't you know it, one of the biohazard bins flips out and decides to fly around the whole work shop getting everything all bloody again. In short I clocked out and quit, never to play this game again. P.S: I now have full blown OCD. 11/10 Would play again to cure my OCD			"

Fun, Festive & FrustratingViscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage is not a DLC it’s a standalone festive version of the main game Viscera Cleanup Detail. It costs $2.49 and consists of 1 level (The Santa level). I played it with 1 other and the level is unique and a lot of the details allow you to build your own story as to what happened here. It's a 2 hour map for new players, took me 1.5 to clean it perfectly and 2.5 to clear EVERYTHING. There are 13 achievements that require you to beat the level at least 2-3 times in different ways which can take between 1 - 2.5 hours. I got 100% on the 10 hour mark so there is a fair bit of gameplay and challenge to be had but it becomes quite a grind and I was glad when it was all over. 6/10- Festive theme, Achievements are a grind but worth a play for any Viscera Cleanup Detail fan "

												Great co-op game with play with friends.My friends and I once ENTIRELY cleaned the Workshop...but when we were going to clock off it said that it wasn't finished so we searched it up and apparently some of the items and blood stains are OUTSIDE the map! So I used ghost (aka no-clip) and went outside. I found 2 blood stains and 1 elf. 1min later we tried to clock off, guess what happened? Cmon, you'll never guess it...no achievement and a waste of 4 hours...but it was pretty fun though 10/10 would clean up a bloody (literally) workshop again			"

												This game is the best - I've played more of the Christmas Edition than the normal edition - but seriously, the best if you're looking for non-intensive immersion gameplay. It does get frustrating after a while when you keep having to redo parts, but that's also part of the fun so suck it up princess. The best part is the gore - seriously, the cartoony gore. This game knows it's meant for fun and just runs with it.			"

												I have OCD.  Not really, REALLY bad OCD, but enough that I have little mini-rituals of shaking door handles and checking every window, etc etc, before I go out or go to bed.  And even I can't imagine what kind of OCD-riddled LUNATIC would actually be able to get the achievement in this game which involves cleaning each and every inch of Santa's heavily-soiled workshop.  That's not to say it's that big a gaming area...an ""open-world"" game this sure as ♥♥♥♥ ain't, even if it is a tad sandbox-y (read: no story) for my usual tastes.  Santa's workshop is literally a handful of rooms, but man...the effort it takes to clean up even a couple of bodies and a few pools of blood...you gotta be a freakin' SAINT to have that kinda patience, let me tell ya.  Hell, it took me a few unsuccessful attempts before I was even able to plunge my blood-soaked mop into a bucket of water without spilling said bucket and having to go get a new one.  A SAINT, I tell you.  Me, I quickly gave up on such a monumental, pedantic task and set to making more of a mess and blowing ♥♥♥♥ up.  At least that was vaguely ""fun"".   Look, it's a cute little (emphasis on ""little"", as in short, and relatively marginal) gimmick game, with an amusing and original premise (based, of all things, on a Weird Al Yankovic song - ""The Night Santa Went Crazy"" - or am I just making presumptions here?) which could surely never have been stretched beyond a few hours' worth of gameplay.  A quick glimpse at the screenshots and brief read of the marketing description, and if it sounds like ""you"", then what's a couple of bucks?  Me, I'll probably just play long enough to get a couple more achievements - the easy ones, not the one I mentioned above - then I guess maybe I'll dig it out for a half-hour every second or third December as a brief antidote to all that unbearably fake ""Christmas cheer"", before I inevitably tire of its limitations and muster up the will to play something more rewarding.     Consider this a RESERVED recommendation at best.  It's no masterpiece, not even for a ""gimmick"" game - see Little Inferno if you want an example of a game which is so very much more than it has any right to be - but it's distracting enough, for however brief a spell.  In better hands it could have admittedly been better, but really, with a title like that...what are you expecting?  Keep your expectations low, and you'll be fine.  The worse that can happen is you'll feel cheated and decide you wasted a couple of bucks and hate Christmas EVEN ♥♥♥♥ING MORE.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  If there's one thing this world needs, it's more Scrooges.  ♥♥♥♥ XMAS.Verdict: 6/10.			"

												It’s very hard to recommend this game, while it starts out as being fun it quickly turns into a chore to play. You may make it to the end and give yourself a well-earned pat on the back however when the time comes to clock out you might find that all the hours you just spent cleaning has been a big waste of time.Items such as buckets fall under the map making it impossible to finish the game, I found sometimes when tnt came out of the wash-o-matic I was unable to pick it up straight away leading to more frustration.Even though I was averaging 90fps I found the game extremely nauseous inducing even with the settings turned right down, this was only made worse with more blood, buckets and waste bins that were introduced into the game.Now that I have finished the game I don’t think I will ever play it again, kind of a one time play type of game only made worse by not being able to save progress.5/10			"

												I love how these games are so strangely addicting I love the series.What you are doing:Mopping up bloodBurning or shredding bodies/body parts, trash, bins. buckets and pretty much anything you can touchDestroying evidence You are basically responsible for covering up for murders.It seems like a boring concept in some areas because you are just a janitor, but although it is time consuming when I play and look back at the clock I realize I ended up playing for hours it's very strange and a great pass time game. The Auto saves don't always work right but you can manually save using the esc key to get to the menu.			"

												(The game was provided by Zaraki Snakenoman.  Thanks, man.)A decent experience on Steam, a janitorial simulator.  Choose to make it cleaner, dirtier, or....emptier than when you started.   Great for those who have an obsessive urge to clean up messes...or just to burn stuff.  Although the experience is decent, the replayability for it is limited unless cleaning/burning/messes are habits you'd like to satisfy.  Though, some of it can be more rewarding in real life than in the game.My complaint, however, is that there are some areas that your sniffer (a radar that picks up grime and clutter, only it works on a hot/cold system rather than a radar) reacts to, yet when you try everything, the invisible mess is still there.Definitely not worth full price.  Get it while it's on sale if you're interested in it.6/10			"

Choose to make it cleaner, dirtier, or....emptier than when you started.   Great for those who have an obsessive urge to clean up messes...or just to burn stuff.  Although the experience is decent, the replayability for it is limited unless cleaning/burning/messes are habits you'd like to satisfy.  Though, some of it can be more rewarding in real life than in the game.My complaint, however, is that there are some areas that your sniffer (a radar that picks up grime and clutter, only it works on a hot/cold system rather than a radar) reacts to, yet when you try everything, the invisible mess is still there.Definitely not worth full price.  Get it while it's on sale if you're interested in it.6/10			"

												Let me put it this way, you get what you pay for, 2.49 yep thats worth the price. Its a dumb little bit of fun, it has a nice dark bit of humor that I myself enjoy, seeing everything destroyed and wondering how in the hell this happened, and just messing with items gave me about 30 minutes of fun. I can say if you enjoy dark humor and have a little change in your pocket, check it out.			"

												I was thinking of buying the full Viscera Cleanup Detail game but after playing this I'm glad I didn't. There are no tutorials so if you don't understand anything, tough. It seems they went down the road of making a har har physics game rather than something with actual gameplay. Often, you end up making more of a mess than you're cleaning due to unavoidable clumsiness that the game seems to think is part of the fun.			"

												This review is basically in the middle of yes and no. The game is pretty fun but there is not much to do and it becomes boring super fast. The graphics are good the controls are also good but unless your the type of person that goes achievement hunting in a game there is no way you will play more then a hour of this game. The problem I have with this game is that there are 3 different Viscera cleanup games. This one, a space station one, and some sort of dlc i believe. If all 3 of the games I just listed were different levels in one the game would be more enjoyable. If your going to get this game make sure it's on sale			"

												If you enjoy staying late to clean something up by yourself in silence, this is a fine distraction for a few hours.  It's very entertaining busy work at first, and you can get a bit carried away trying to dispose of all the gore.  But a few hours in and every new spill or hastily roasted grenade makes you groan, and you realize being trapped in a 3 room house, being told you haven't burned every last bullet or shard of glass, is less a game and more a slavery simulator.I had to exit and uninstall just to feel like I could breathe again.

												How did this all happen?Song of a santa-elveIt was late at night on christmas eve I was dreaming of the soft white snow I was awoken by a noise near the christmas tree What it was I did not know It was santa claus, he was bringing me some gifts Unfortunately I did not know that  So I quietly snuck up behind him and I shot him five times in the back It went ""bow, bow, bow, bow, bow"" He said ""what the ♥♥♥♥ - ow, ow, ow"" Then I shot him three more times in the head Pieces of his brain flew out and he was dead That's when I noticed his blood-soaked beard And his red suit filled with bullet holes  I said ""Oh my god, I killed santa claus -I'm not going to jail for this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥""  So I went do my shed and I got my saw And I started to chopedy, chop, chop  I started with his arms, then his legs, then his head and then the torso was a really long job And the blood went spurt, spurt, spurt It was really hard work, work, work It was hard cutting through his spine I must have vomited 16 times I burned all the pieces in my fireplace The smell of burning human flesh filled my nose 11 hours later there was nothing left then thats when I heared my telephone It was aunty Gene looking for uncle Bob She said he left the house dressed as santa claus But he didn't come home last night ""Have you seen him, god I hope he's allright""  "

I would be walking like normal and then suddenly I would be blasted across the map and my hard work would be ruined.I had a molotav randomly explode when I picked it up- and half the stuff was glitched.Everything is just too hyper sensitive- I tried putting things in the waste basket to make things easier and I knocked it over and it flew across the room by putting a knife in it.It's not bad game! It's just got wayy too many bugs right now for me. I'll change my review if it gets an update.			"

												I could not get multiplayer to work, which is a shame since this game is the equivalent of pulling teeth to play by yourself. Maybe it's Windows 8, maybe it's because the multiplayer is in beta. People on YouTube don't seem to be having any issues, I guess they're just lucky. Overall, it's a fun game.. It would be even more fun to play with a friend. If only ;( .			"

												Like all the Viscera Cleanup Detail games, I heartily recommend this! These guys just keep pumping out original content while polishing the main game for release. I thought this was a gag when my friends first told me about it and I'm glad I was wrong. This edition was a treat. Viscera Cleanup Detail is all about you trying to clean up someone else's mess after everything gets bloody and blown up. This time, you're going to the North Pole. Santa's workshop is a colorful wonderland and your in game radio's Christmas tunes do a good job of keeping your spirits up as you dispose of dynamite, knives, and tons of elf bodies. Oh, and lots of empty whiskey bottles.I have to touch on the cons though, before I can say what else I love about this game. Dynamite is ihe bane of this particular iteration. When Santa went crazy, he went dynamite happy. Careless handling of dynamite can toss messes way out of the reach of your mop, leading to lots of profanity and frustrations and rendering a full cleanup almost impossible. Given that the bucket machine now tosses live dynamite at you on occasion, it just feels like the devs are being unfair to the players. Of all the messes the space janitor has had to clean up, this may be the hardest. And while the warm mood lighting makes this game's setting pop with color, it also has the unfortunate side effect of making some of the lightest blood stains super hard to see, especially against the wood grains. Hopefully this might be corrected in a future version of the game, but at least your trusty sniffer still works well for finding the lost messes. Back to the pros!The gameplay VCD is known for is still here, and, like they did in the Shadow Warrior level, there are side objectives you can do as well for Steam achievements, namely tracking down all of the toy guns and officially licensed Rooks Keep action figures for your trunk. When you clock out, the punchout machine lists what souvenirs you dropped into your trunk. There are also numerous achievements for how well you cleaned. Did you manage to not break any of the delicate Christmas ornaments around the shop? Did you scorch the place clean of all holiday items? Did you throw your bucket dispenser's hat into the fire? The number of Steam achievements here gives the game some replayability beyond trying to see how fast or how messy you can clean things up.  The black humor found in the game's macabre setting is hit and miss, however; some of the fun in a new level of VCD is seeing how awful the messes are and figuring out a way to efficiently get things done. Some of the outlandish deaths and scenes you uncover work great, but I think the humor found in Santa's letters that outline his descent into booze and bullets felt like the writers were trying too hard. There are nuggets of humor but we get it when all the kids just want the latest expensive gadgets even though they behave like brats. A few letters are fine but after a while they all sound the same.The physics can get wonky still in a few places but this level still shows the level of polish that Runestorm is trying to create with their small team. Who knew that Santa going on an alcohol-fueled rampage could lead to one of the best Christmas releases ever? So what are you waiting for? Strap on your candy striped rubber gloves, grab your mop and get ready to save Christmas!			"
