												One of the best Star Wars games still today. Both X-Wing and TIE-Fighter games represent how good games are made. Solid stories, solid flight engine and a very rewarding ""career mode"". I will love these games forever!			"

												Ok, So I have a ""vintage"" PC just to play this game in its original splendor. Its a dual processor Pentium II system at 400mhz and I have DOS 6.2 on & Windows 95. Its kinda been collecting dust in the closet for a while but I kept it just to play these old X-wing games.Now, I don't have to pull the old P2 rig out of the closet anymore. I can plug in my Logitech Extreme 3d Pro Joystick and/or Xbox controller and BAM! Back into 1993 I go! I think this is honestly one of the best flight combat sims of the 90's and am surprised it has taken so long to be re-released for newer platforms. If you like Star Wars, and want to fly around blowing up all kinds of TIE fighters & even the bigger stuff like Star Destroyers, get this game. It will satisfy your rebel needs and the force may end up with you.Star Wars spaceship combat.... gotta say 10/10 for its day & a true classic!			"

												I have purchased every version of this game since it's original release in the 90's.  This is one of my all time favorite games.  This version includes the classic Floppy disk version and the remastered windows 95 edition.  The Collectors edition CD-Rom is missing from this version.  also missing is the Strategy guide, but half the fun of this game is how brutally hard it can be.  I reccomend this game, but not the Steam implementation of it because of the bugs.The remasterd version included has better graphics than the ""classic"" version, but is limited to only working with a joystick or gamepad (I'm using a logitech F310 USB).  this version has problems making it mostly unplayable because of the ghost cursor.  Forum posts about this issue don't help to resolve it, version purchased elsewhere doesn't have these problems.The classic version works just fine including workign with my gamepad. There is not a way to customize the joystick layout in this version.  you can get some pretty good scaling if you aren't afraid of editing the dosbox configuration file in the classic folder.  just remember this version was designed for 300x200 resolution and won't look great stretched to 16:9 at 1920x1080.  This version can be played using the keyboard and mouse and even with the gamepad you have to use the keyboard for so many of the functions anyway that it might play better with a keyboard and mouse.

												Cons:1)  Two mouse cursors when navigating the spaceport menus2)  Absolutely zero effort on refreshing/updating the game3)  No (as far as I can find) sensitivity control which means I'm constantly course correcting4)  That ♥♥♥♥ing pilot proving ground that was boring in the 90's and is even more so now! Did ANYONE ever finish it? It's like driving from Land's End to John O'Groats in a milkfloat5)  Still can't figure out how to let us play with a mouse in windows? After 20 odd years? Really? 6)  Exceedingly weird way of defining your joypad - see how long it takes you to figure out what's going onPros:1)  I forgive all of the above - because it's the ultimate classic starfighterConclusion:It's like running into your old girlfriend after you've been married to someone else for 20 years. She looks older, a bit wrinkly and you've both moved in your lives without any regrets. New jobs, kids, living somewhere else. And, after spending a little time with the old flame, you remember why you broke up and what irritated you about her. But at the same time, you recognise what you find attractive in her because even though she's aged and you've aged, there's still a little something there. A little beauty and a comfortable feeling you can't ignore. And there's no doubt at all that you are DESPERATE to have an affair because she is irresistable...			"

												What can I say? Thank you that these games are finally on STEAM. When I saw these games are available on Steam it was an instant buy for me. I am a STAR WARS fan since I first saw the movies on video tape back in the day when I was a child and life was sooo cool. Well not so cool if one of your floppy disks have reading errors and you cannot install your version of X-Wing anymore. OK enough talking about the past but this game is still a blast!! What I like is that they not even give you the original classic DOS version, the remastered version with higher resolution and new textures is also included in this package. The sounds are great like in the movie. The screaming of the TIE Fighters give me goosebumps and the digitized speech is just sooo oldschool you´re gonna love this game. The classic version which runs in DOSBOX has been configured very good so you don´t need to edit the config files or DOSBOX settings for this one. If you never heard of these games before it could be a bit difficult to get on with these games because they´re  not just action games they are simulators. So it needs a bit of training to win your first battles but if you win it is just a great feeling. Oh yeah before I forget the upgrade kit and the mission disk B-Wing both are included in this package too. So go ahead and click it! If you like my reviews please visit my profile leave a comment or just simply add me as a friend. Have a good time :shelterfox:			"

												This game works fine for me in windows 10 64 bit but it will involve following some steps mentioned on the game forum here. I regularly play the other games in the series but I've not played this since the 90's. I still have the original boxed with 5 floppy disks, the first pc game I ever played and the special edition is good but no midi music like the original. This game is still a challenge even using a mouse (to use mouse through a joystick driver I use GlovePIE and ppjoy virtual joystick).I've forgotten how brutal starfighter collisions are in this game. It is for this reason I can see myself finishing the game while remaining only on flight officer rank because of all the dead starfighter debris flying into me because I'm too close even when I have double shields charged. If it wasn't for this you'll be able to get to General but good luck not dying or getting captured atleast once!Very easy to kill star destroyers though, take out shield generators and hide close to the engines. I can see why they put engine wash in XVT and XWA because of that.Worth getting in the star wars bundle for sure!			"

												Runing Win 7 x64.  No problems loading or playing this game after the install.  The debreifing does have speach.  I have all versions of this game on CD, but those require some setup.  This Steam version opens and plays without issue.  Playing it again after all these years brings back the memories.  Setting up the joystick takes a bit to figure out.  Press a button to map the button you want, then use the bottom arrows in the menu to scroll through the choices, select your option and then move to the next button by pressing it.  2 mouse cursors on the providing grounds, but just ignore the windows one and concentrate on the game mouse to navigate to your next mission.  no issues during game play.  Not sure why all the negative feedback.  I have no issues with my Nvidia 780, quad core i7, 16G RAM and 3D pro joystick.  So glad Steam took all the setup headache out of the install, so I can just play the game Ive been missing.			"

												Such a great classic. I have fond memories as a child playing, both this game and Tie Fighter, dogfighting, chasing ships, scanning freighters, and carrying out secret missions for the Republic/Empire. At first I was disdained that Steam did not include the vastly superior Collector's CD versions like GOG did. But as of May 3, 2016 they are now included! So I can't recommend them enough to you and anybody that likes space simulators as this is one of the best there is! Every version is compatible with gamepads (though with the DOS versions it doesn't seem like you can really remap controls so you need to play in conjunction with a keyboard, but the controller is intuitive enough).Please play both this and Tie Fighter. These are two of the best LucasArts games (and 90s games in general) that you will find. You'll have a blast! Thank you, Disney, for finally including the Collector's CD editions! (even though it took about a year!)			"

												Ignore my current Hours I have put in literally hundreds of hours on this game.YAY Steam has released the X-Wing collection. I still have my cd's but prefer playing through Steam.Hopefully Lucas arts/Disney will release a new version of these games someday. Could you imagine XWA in modern graphics? I cannot relate to the people who are whining about not being able to add the XWAU or comparing it to the GOG release My entire time on this game has been unmodified on the standard vanilla game. I think the game was fantastic as a release and it does not need playing with.Thank you Steam!X-Wing the one that started this fantastic series. This is by far the hardest and most unforgiving installment in the series. I always found the aiming to be a bit weird compared to TF and XWA but its still great even today.Lucas arts / Disney really need to make a new version of this series!			"

												Problems with the 1998 versions of X-Wing include the game crashing on using hardware mode, mouse emulation problems, stuttering cutscenes and slowmo in the UI. Other than that, the game is great and would recommend for anyone looking for a good star wars space dogfight sim. The dosbox version included runs flawlessly and you can actually assign other pilots as wingmen in that version which helps in some missions. They did away with this feature in the 98 version.Edit: This also lacks the 1994 (DOS) Collector's edition which had some minor updates to the ""classic"" version. Would still recommend this one regardless of that though. Unlike Tie Fighter, there were not a whole lot of differences between the 1993 and 1994 versions that I can remember.			"

I still own the original disk but wanted a ""working"" digital copy as it's only a matter of time before the disk is no longer functional. The gog version which I purchased works fine for my PC ... go figure. This ported version is unplayable on both classic or special edition for steam. Going through the troubleshooting was not fun and every option did not work. I expected better from steam and really feel let down. I wasted my money but learned a good lesson.

Had to play being that it's so bad with the graphics, but those scenes and the ability to assign (and name) your own wingmen wasn't transfered in the newer versions.  I WISH this game would be remade for 4K TV/PCs and that they'd keep the original flight engine.  The X-Wing vs Tie Figher changed this and it was horrific!			"

												Running this on a single-core Pentium with Windows XP. The classic version runs flawlessly (I have the original disked version running under DOS Box on the same computer, and it lags with unresponsive controls), The Special Edition version brings up at Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Error ( R6030 -CRT not initialized ), so no comment on the Special Edition until I find out how to resolve that issue.The game holds up very well in regards to game play and user interface. New to the game players should have little problem involving themselves in the game. The inability to use a throttle slider is a bit annoying--but simply demands a bit more ability to multi-task. My old pilot files fit right in.Graphics obviously stand as dated, using fairly blocky shapes: but for a game that is 20+ years old one shouldn't expect smooth CG that demands 2GB GPUs. The older graphics do not rob the game of its playability, and for the old-school gamer (or those lucky enough to cut their teeth on gaming in the early 1990s), it will remind them of the days when it was about the mission, and the need to think of how to play the game, instead of the flashy visuals that dominate today's games.Enjoy it for what it is.And for those who have played it through, and want something a bit different, get X-ED, Dos Box, and modify and create your own missions (because having three or four Star Destorys battle it out with the same number of Mon Cal cruisers is a beautiful thing to weave your X-Wing through).

												I'm sure that everyone looking at buying this game has already played it in the past. So we'll skip the rave review about how amazing it is. It holds up well, and with mods like Darksaber's craft pack that bring it graphically a little more up to date, it's even better. I wish with all my heart we'd get a new X-Wing/TIE Fighter game with the level of fidelity these always had. Sadly, in the day of cookie cutter arcade style shooters and ""sims"" we'll never see it. If we do, it'll be some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized half port of Battelfront or something. The 90's were truly the golden era of games, in no small part thanks to what the original X-Wing and TIE Fighter sims launched. If EA/Disney ever get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and make a new one with a story this good, content this deep and the selection of ships this large, I'll be over the moon. Since that will literally never happen though, thank you Steam/Lucasarts for making this available to us. Great memories. Anyone on the fence, buy the whole X-Wing/TIE fighter series. You won't be disappointed even today. If you need a graphical boost, check out Darksaber's craft pack for XWA.			"

												Second game I've tried from the Humble Bundle that just flat out doesn't work. Can't get either version (classic or special edition) to run. Tried every tip and trick in the forums but this seems like I just flushed my money down the drain.Don't bother. I've been told GOG verson works.			"

												I'd probably wait or buy the GOG version to see if they iron out issues or include the ""best"" version of this game (1994 Collector's CD-ROM)1. The game is thirsting for lag, cutscenes, menus, et cetera, et cetera!2. IDK if this only happens to me, but even if I try the DosBox version, it requires some sort of key to enter. "

												I played a little of the supposedly superior collector's edition, which is not included with this, and I actually found I preferred the special edition that comes in this steam version with its 3d graphics, joystick mapping support, and music (vs the midi music).Now, as far as gameplay, my main complaint with this game is the difficulty spikes and ensuing frustration. I was going to give this a negative review after getting stuck on one of the stages, but I eventually figured out a trick to overcome it. The difficulty spikes wouldn't be a problem if there was some way to lower the difficulty while still enjoying the story, but there isn't. You can turn on cheats, but it won't let you progress in the game. In addition, some of the levels have moments where you're sitting around doing nothing. There's a lot less of these moments in the later X Wing series games. That can be particularly frustrating when the hard part of the stage is towards the end, meaning you have to sit there playing the same easy part over and over and spend a bunch of time waiting. Anyway, if you aren't willing to put up with some occasionally stupid levels, I would not recommend this.It's not just that, though. Even if you have a joystick, you'll be lucky if you can get rolling to work. This is actually really important to be able to use in some of the later stages and I couldn't get it to work. I'm not sure how it's supposed to be mapped because there isn't an option for roll in the joystick settings. Overall, the joystick support is a real hassle but the game doesn't really work as well on a mouse or controller.On the positive side, for being such an old game, it's highly immersive. I actually think this is the advantage of the 3d and the actual music as opposed to the midi soundtrack (and, overall, the updated engine). It reminds me of the level of immersion and attention to detail you can find in the other awesome star wars game, Republic Commando. It's satisfying to master using your laser to hit moving targets, and the visuals and sound help make it that much more gratifying when you successfully take out a ship.So, if you're looking to only play one really fun game in the series, I would look at the other X wing games. However, if you are willing to put up with some frustration in the pursuit of experiencing the whole series, definitely don't be afraid of playing this one. I haven't played it with keyboard or 360 controller, I only played this with my joystick. I would probably not recommend this game if you don't have a decent joystick.But, overall, I wouldn't recommend this due to the frustration, lack of options for easing up the difficulty, poor joystick configuration capability, and the fact that you can get the same game with the extra collector's edition on GOG for the same price.

												This game has still much work to do. I installed on two machines, but gets the same issues with the newer version: cutscene and independence menu lags like you would play it on a Pentium 1. Takes about 1-2 minutes to navigate around the Independence to a newer mission. I also have the double cursor. Once you are in-game it goes better, but it can still crash if I hit the ESC button. Vintage version plays very good, thanks to DosBox :).I recommend to test it before you buy...I guess it was just thrown before us, motto: ""there I fixed it"".			"

												Even though the Windows Version Requires the use a Joystick to play. The MS-DOS Version of X-Wing Special Edition is very fun to play. Enlist in the Rebel Alliance as a Rookie Starpilot & rise through the Ranks as you win battles for the Rebel Alliance against the Galactic Empire set before the Battle of Yavin 4 by playing 5 Tours of Duty Campaigns or you can practice in the Historical Missions & Pilot Proving Grounds, all those contain a grand total of 148 Missions to play through. If you don't have a Joystick, then play the MS-DOS Versions of X-Wing.In Tour of Duty 1, you'll be enlisting new allies for the Rebel Alliance as you Destroy Imperial Supplies.In Tour of Duty 2, you'll be finding the Death Star Plans & Delivering them to Princess Leia.In Tour of Duty 3, you get to take on the Death Star & if you're REALLY GOOD, you get to do the Trench Run.In Tour of Duty 4, you'll need to help the Rebels evacuate Yavin 4, resist growing Imperial pressure and the new Interdictor Cruiser.In Tour of Duty 5, your Mission focuses on the production of a new craft, the B-wing and its delivery to the Rebellion. This Tour of Duty sets the stage for The Empire Strikes Back.Opening Crawls:= X-Wing Special EditionA long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

												There's something Star Wars and Command & Conquer: Red Alert have in common: I was never able to play as the good guys at first. My computer couldn't run X-Wing, and our Allied disc of C&C: Red Alert broke, so I was stuck playing as the bad guys (the Soviets, and TIE Fighter). Then, a wonderful thing happened, the Special Edition of X-Wing and TIE Fighter came out in a single box, and I had to get it, and I found X-Wing to be rather disappointing. Don't get me wrong, I'm proud to fly for the Rebel Alliance, but X-Wing lacks features that TIE Fighter and later games included:-The in-flight map is only two-dimensional.-The targeting display is just a diagram instead of a 3D model.-There are no in-flight messages, save mission-critical stuff.-The Q-Spacebar method of ending missions isn't here.But the biggest surprise is that this game is HARD. In order to get a training patch, you must complete 8 levels to earn a Flight Badge, which is no small feat. In the Tours of Duty, dying will get you demoted to the bottom rank, and you can expect to die a lot. Even when it came time for the Death Star Trench Run, there's so much junk and turets in the trench that I was torn to shreds like wet tissue paper. The only strategy I found to work was to flight some 20 km away from the nav buoy (and hope it's the right direction) and fly straight down, hoping I hit the exhaust port.However, the game doesn't end there, taking you through 2 more tours, ending with the founding of the Hoth base, which gives you the impression that it's a long time between A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. In the end, if you're up for a challenge, or really want to be a Rebel like I did, go for it. If not, play the better games in this series.			"

												Great in its day, not so much now. Funny how the re-release coincides with the hype of the new film.... Why they pumped these out instead of a new game is beyond me, unless the cash is going towards paying Lucas off for the rights ;). Classic mode works for me (painful playing a version released on floppy disk though) but special edition doesn't for some reason. Only for real nostalgia lovers or when it goes on sale for £1.50. Some may love it but, for me anyway, feels like a waste of money and didn't bring back the heady heights of when it was first out. I'll rest in the knowledge that although getting a shoddy outdated re-release I can't play at least I've paid for some coffee and sandwiches on the next Disney film's catering budget to keep an overpaid actor well fed, you're welcome.... :)			"

												The single best tactical space shooter of all time.  IMHO.Just been replaying it for the first time in over 22 years and seems just as fun as it was when first release.  A bit rough round the edges - other posts will testify to the advancements made in the genre since - but the playability and challenge is still there.Lack of clarity around mission goal completion is probably the biggest single drawback but other than that its lots of fun.

												My original review is on the bottom with a thumbs up.  After putting in 30+ hours, its a thumbs down.  This game in its current condition is not to be played on modern machines.  It works on win10 with no problems.  There is an excellent group out there who is working tirelessly on 3D acceleration and the game looks marvelous.  But I fear all of their work will be ultimately to no good.Two reasons.  1) This game is meant to be played with a stick.  I hate mousers who play flight/space sims with a first person point-of-view.  You're missing the part of the realness.  But it can be played with a mouse.  But, if you're a mouser, stop reading now.  Vintage X-wing players and those who use a stick will find a massive deadzone on both stick axes.  The deadzone is so bad, I and barely maintain a torpedo lock.  The is stick is going everywhere.  To me, a game is not fun if it cant be easily navigated.  And its not fun.  2) With modern machines, I suspect that this old code is processed much faster than the 386 PC I used to run the game on.  The ships don't move faster, but they move more efficiently.  The TIEs, even on early missions juke around like experts as soon as they are lined up in the crosshairs.  Of course, coupled with a bad deadzone issue, TIEs are almost impossible to hit in time sensitive, ship guarding missions like Tour of Duty 1 mission 7.  I did find that the deadzone on the Collector's CD version is better but its at 320 x 200 resolution.  My eyes were crying adjusting to that rez.I hate that I cant finish this one but maybe TIE fighter's engine is a little better with the deadzone issue.  It'd be nice if Disney do a real update on this game or at least support the community in really fixing it.  At this point, I feel Disney when for a money grab on the elderly (us who are older now and wanted a piece of nostalgia).  But I did get it in a bundle.  Ha!Ha! Disney.=================================================================This is not the X-Wing Trilogy edition with all the updated graphics.  This more like the first compilation, the Collector's  CD edition.  This uses the updated TIE Fighter engine.  However, most importantly,  it has all the expansions.I bought this game on day one, along with TIE fighter and all expansions back in the day.  I still have it on 3 1/2 inch floppies and was elated when steam brought it over.  In my opinion, it was better than Wing Commander at the time.I briefly jumped in to see if all components were working.  And they do.  It loads and plays well on Win 7.  DONOT select 640x480 hardware option.  Again, all of the expansions are present.  Play it long enough and you'll get used to the 640x480 graphics.  I promise you it will be worth it.  It will be a good time passer until star citizen gets up and running.  The only complaint is....where is the manual?!?  This game has A LOT of keystrokes.  At least post a reference card, sheesh!!Well I'm off to shoot down some TIEs.  May the force be with you.Edit 1: Found the manual in the install folder :)			"

												X-Wing is not a perfect game. It is the first in a series of four games and therefore had basically all of the growing pains; the worst game engine, a story much worse than its follow up (TIE Fighter), a less than intuitive menu UI (I personally don't think this was fixed until the third game; X-Wing vs TIE Fighter), but... it's still a very fun game. The story goes from just after the first death star was nocked out on until Hoth and it's an enjoyable ride. My recommendation is to use the Collector's CD-ROM version which uses the game engine from TIE Fighter instead of the less than great original one; same as with TIE Fighter there is a MIDI based soundtrack that adjusts to recent events. Enemy reinforcements arrived? Scary music. Dogfight? Exciting music. Just took out a TIE Interceptor? Uplifting music that fades back to the exciting music because you're still in a damned dogfight. It's great, though it is graphically inferior to the Remastered edition that uses a version of the X-Wing vs Tie Fighter Engine and the accompanying increased graphical improvements. The Collector's CD-ROM version also has great voice overs though it suffers from the low bit rate it was obviously recorded at. Long story short: Collector's CD-ROM is the best. Remastered is prettier but misses out on some neat features. Classic is bleh (it's basically a prototype to build up to making the TIE Fighter engine and game).Technical Side notes: There is an XWA wrapper required to get the Remastered version working 100% correctly and a launch option of -softwarecursor must be set as well. https://github.com/rdoeffinger/xwa_ddraw_d3d11/releases/latest just paste it in your remastered folder for X-Wing.You may have to fiddle with some DOSbox settings for some of the versions to get the correct sized window or what have you but it isn't anything particularly complicated. A good 4:3 window size I like to use is 960x720.If you have issues with the initial screen doing the joystick calibration on launch; alt+c during a mission or training will launch the in engine calibration and you can do it then.

												I remember this game when my dad made a copy of a DOS version at a company he used to work for some 20-25 years ago. I think it required something like 7 to 10 floppy disks to work. Unfortunately, I think a file became corrupt. After installing the game, the graphics would get distored to the point where the game was glitching all the time. It wasn't until the collectors edition that came in the X-Wing Trilogy that was released back in 2000 that I got a chance to get it back. It's nice to have these games working in Windows 10.There is one urk I found. These are the joysticks/gamepads I own:Logitech Attack 3XBOX 360 WirelessLogitech Gamepad F310I tried all of these controllers as my X-Wing was running into the proving ground platforms. It's not until I went into the Game Controller settings (in Windows) where I could configure my controller that I figured out what I could do. I selected ""Advanced"" and got the option of selecting a particular game controller to work with older games. I tried it with both the Attack and the F310. The option allowed both game controllers to work in X-Wing. So, if you have problems getting it to work, try this (at least for WIndows 10).Edit: The XBOX controller might work with the game after all. I turned it on and it became a third option under ""Advanced"". As such, seeing as how it disappears from the settings whenever it goes to sleep, I would not advise using that particular controller (or any controller that can sleep) with X-Wing.			"

												there are only 2/3 of the x-wing games released here. The classic 93 floppy version, which has poor graphics, no speech, and poor sound and the 98 CD version that has better graphics but is otherwise gutted and not playable. If you want the best version of this game, I recommend buying a CD of the 94 version on amazon or ebay and run it on dosbox. UPDATE: They have now added the '94 version and its even optimized better that I could do it on DOS Box with the physical CD. It is wonderful game and a great buy if you truly love the real Star Wars movies.			"

												EDIT: This now includes the 1994 edition, I have changed my review to recommended.This does NOT include the 1994 (DOS CD) edition (better graphics). GoG has this correct version, I don't know why GoG just got it and Steam can't?? Same goes for the 1995 (DOS Collector's CD-ROM) of the Tie Fighter Special Edition on Steam and GoG... Great game and I've been waiting a long time for Steam to add this, but I don't recommend it until Valve adds the better version of the game. Thumbs down will remain until Steam includes the 1994 version, otherwise this is great.			"

												The Definitive Star Wars Flight Sim.  I legitimately lost years of my childhood to playing this game on weekends and summers non stop.  While not as devoloped as its sequel TIE Fighter it still holds the best place in my collection.  Still fun after all these years.			"

												This is the game that started my PC gaming addiction!!!.....The gameplay is still excellent.  Even this many years on and I remember how I beat most of the missions.....(hint) you need to learn to adjust your power so you can get to places faster.  Yes the graphics are dated.....think of it as a trip down memory lane.  Besides our new computers can play this game nice and smooth now.   When that ""starwars"" music track starts when your in the missions.............you become part of Red Squadron.  I did have some issues with graphics.. You need to turn on software...or hardware in the steam settings somewhere ...I forgetnow....you can google it..it was quite easy to find and fix.  Join the alliance ...they need good pilots...have you got what it takes???			"
