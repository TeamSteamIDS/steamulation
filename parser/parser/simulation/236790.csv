												Agricultural Simulator 2013 Steam Edition is a very good Farming game with a lot of realism built into it. BUT.......... No support from the developers and the fact that you cannot even start a new game makes this product unuseable. It's too bad that this has happened to this game because I enjoyed it very much up until I was unable to play due to the developer abandoning us here on Steam. I cannot give this game a good reveiw at all. Purchase Farming Simulator 2013 instead.			"

												Hands down one of the top 3 worst games I've ever had the misfortune of buying, playing, and even help debug.  The developer Actalogic is just not up to par to develop quality games, since they use an outdated and broken game engine that has so many holes you'd think it was Fallout New Vegas' Hoover Dam being fought over by the NCR and Ceasar's Legion.For 1 whole month a number of players and the CEO of Actalogic tried to work together to debug the game by testing over and over to make a list of reproducable errors (not all that easy to do for some).  Each little 'patch' would end up plugging one hole to only create 3 new holes in the 'Hoover Dam' that is AG2013.  In the end Mr. CeO just left for vacation and never returned leaving us with a long list of promises and upcoming updates.IF you're lucky to get it to work on your PC and think all is smooth sailing, just wait...you just wait.   Play the game using the same save file for 20+hrs using the equipment to build your own farm up.  Then, you'll know what we already know.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. As someone who has played and enjoyed many hours of Farming Simulator 2013 but found certain aspects lacking I saw Agricltural Simulator 2013 to be the answer my wants. With the ability to reshape fields, hire workers and manage them in all aspects it seemed to have all the features I was looking for. Unfortunately, while those features are present, the game itself is a horrible pile of bugs which make it unplayable even at lowest settings. I cannot recommend that anyone spend actual money on this game.			"

												It is a nice looking farming game with many new creative ideas that no other farming game has. Too bad that the developers didn't have time/money to finish making the game. The game is so buggy you cant even play it. I have a brand new gaming computer wich can run BF4 on Ultra settings with no lag (and many other demanding games) but this game is so badly optimized it's not even playable. I bought it on the release day for over a year ago and the devs has not made anything to make it more playable since then. So DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!			"

												bought it cheap on bundlestars and got bored today, so i gave it a try.good things first: the tutorial is easy to understand, the controls and menu are simple as well.the game has a few different scenarios to play, with a few nice design ideas.you can use different vehicles and interact like on a real farm, yes, so far to the point of a simulator...the bad things: the graphic engine has an incredibly poor performance, everything lags, textures take ages to load, the vehicles and buldings look ""ok"", everything else is just outstanding ugly, especially the water. (dont get fooled by the screenshots on the store page!)the physics in the game are completly broken, driving with 5 km/h can flip your machine over, if you dont pay attention, your trailer can get stuck in the front of your tractor,...or else.the sounds of the environment and animals, the animations... just terrible.after i remembered the fact that i basically paid nothing for it, i just took it with humour and tried to break it even more.it can be quite hilarious when you see how many things can go wrong in a single game. sadly its supposed to be a simulator which turned out to be an insult against humanity.a reason to buy this game could be showing your younger kids the basics about how farming machines work, for that its fair enough, ... or when youre bored with friends and just need a good laugh.but if youre a mature person, looking for a good farming simulator: SKIP THIS ONE!

												I picked this game up for my little son who loves tractors, potato harvesters and so on and so on. He also owns a lot of toy versions of them and plays a lot of them.However - I thought it could be fun to show him a few things in this game. I really tried to get into the routines and the GUI and controls....but nothing is made well.The worst point of all is that it's not running smooth at all. It's lagging all the time and it's looking terrible if I turn everything down. It's not a problem of my rig. I know that a lot of people are able to play this game without any problems but I can't. I tried different video drivers and a few other tweaks.Check the forums - there is no support for this game anymore. No patches. The game feels like a beta build.Even if you are able to play the game smooth, a lot of gear and naturals are randomly disappearing, the GUI is not intuitive, you are ""waking up"" at a huge famn and have no idea what animals you have, what fields you have, where they are, what vehicles you have,... nothing. You have to figure out everything on your own.For a short period I thought it's maybe my fault,...that my rig is guilty that this game is not running well, that I'm too stupid to manage my farm and so on. I downloaded the free Farming Simulator 2013 demo and it's great.TL;TRThis game is NOT Farming Simulator (Landwirtschafts-Simutator). It's a cheap and broken copy!			"

												Insects probably have the largest biomass of the terrestrial animals. At any time, it is estimated that there are some 10 quintillion (10,000,000,000,000,000,000) individual insects aliveThis game probably has the same number of bugs on earth.This game has potential I give it that, but the developers are so lazy perhaps, that they never made an effort to fix it and probably never will.  I think you need an Entomologist to study the number of bugs in this game.  Well I had fun while it lasted.  Please, don't buy this game guys it is still unplayable.			"

												This game isn't even close to finished. At best I'd say that this is the late alpha/early beta stage of what would have been a great farming simulator game, if developers Actalogic had bothered to finish it. Instead, they choose to sell it at full price even though they abandoned all work on it in the summer of 2013. AS2013 could have been the game to beat, with its awesome terrain deformation and beautiful lighting effect. Instead it's just a sad reminder of what could have been if it had been given to a responsible developer.This game is utterly, utterly broken and should not be bought by anyone.			"

												I've read all of the reviews and have no doubt these guys are having the issues they are talking about however I bought the game knowing that there are issues and to be honest, it seems to work pretty good for me.  I have no severe lag or studdering as I've seen mentioned, nothing really out of the ordinary given that I know the game has a few problems.  I also haven't gone looking for problems either.I did follow the advice of a couple of posts about adjusting the some settings using the command window, don't know if that helped or not but the game runs fine.  As long as you're not expecting to aquire a polished and completely stable game and you don't mind the occasional/frequent glitches you should be able to enjoy the game.  Be advised, it is a true farming sim unlike Farming Simulator (which I own) or the new Pro Farmer (I've tried the demo).  You have to do everything manually and it takes time.I hate to be the oddball posting a positive review amongst the overwhelming negative but given I know it has problems, it's not that bad.  Maybe I'm just one of the lucky ones but then again if you think about it most product reviews are reviews written by people that had problems with the item.  Many people who like the item never post anything.  Just my opinion.			"

												If you have ever played Farming Simulator, this at first seems like a big step up when you enter the game. Both ""physically"" and graphically. ""This is pretty rad..."". But it's all downhill from there. Its funny at a start, learning all the tricks and all the features (too bad most of them don't work all the time) and see the tesselation (i guess) but gradually gets more and more frustrating with glitches, crashes and glitches again. The game is far from finished.And from what I have read, about a year ago, the ""promised"" multiplayer never arrived and the updates stopped 2 months after release. How is this game even on steam? Figured they'd have som sort of standard. Guess not.DON'T BUY!Unless you Want to feel like you wasted your money 60% of the time you're playing.			"

												This is a great looking game and plays very nice. However The acheivments are broken, No current support for the game is being offered, Actalogic and UIG developers no longer work with this product. Expect consistant game crashes due to high quantity of bugs even in tire treads which will often flip tractors even on paved roads and flat surfaces. I feel as though this game was given a great chance at success but abandoned to early in the initial phases for the game to really show off its style to sim players. As steam will often show or display this game on weekly deals or top sellers even knowing the game is very broken and has there name on it.

												Worse than 2011.  Graphics are worse, gameplay is worse, UI is worse.  Everything about this game is worse than the one they released in 2011.I've only played it a short little bit due to how bad everything is.  The textures are constantly tearing.  There are gaps in the world, and the mipmipping of textures works terribly.  Roads disappear and reappear as sections of a different road.  Trees will change types due to mipmipping as well (moving away from object.)  The tractor parts disappear if you get to far (short) away.The town is smaller, however you get 4 different smaller ones to look at now.  Fields are much different, you no longer have preset fields but instead make your own.  However it doesn't work nor tell you where to make one.  Everything about this game is ""bad,"" as an understatement.  I greatly enjoyed 2011, however 2013 is one of the worst games I've ever played.  I do however recommend Agricultural Simulator 2011...

A clumsy and cryptic interface, no instructions outside of the tuturial for plowing a field. To cap it off, unfortunate spelling errors such as 'bredding' the chickens in the coop. Ooops!The nice thing I will say is that it's always fun to drive tractors and I like the range you can buy, I enjoyed the mechanics of using the 'extensions' i.e. using the plow etc. But it feels like this was what they spent all their time on and nothing else. Graphics are also sub par.Shame when a game is released that isn't finished and the makers don't appear to have wanted to come back and finish the job either.

												This game is as good ideawise just as bad it is from the technical point of view. In other words, it definitely has wonderful realistic features that other farming simulators do not offer, but it is a horrible buggy software that basically does not run.Pro:- It has tasks like attaching detaching implements to the tractor and filling up seeds in the sower manually which is realistic. Like you have to manually drage sacks of grain in first person instead of just pressing keys from inside the tractor.- Animal husbandry is elaborate and complicated. Again manual feeding tasks and also gathering of milk and eggs in a realistic way.- Good landscapes- Lots of different crop optionsCons:- Glitchy, slow, low fps- Will crash several times- Impossible to continue having patience with it- Bad graphics optimizationSo in spite of having great interest in it, I had to basically abandon trying to play this. Point to note is that its predecessor Agrar Sim 2011 is a much stable product softwarewise, Although its gameplay and feature set is very different.			"

My rig can play games like BF3/Skyrim at Ultra High and at least get 30 - not bragging, just to give you an idea of what kind of system this thing lags on.- You can easily get stuck in a tree using the tractor. Thank god for the reset key (I think it's Q)- The back end of the tractor glitched out and had a VERY LONG POLE coming out of the side.- - Props to the physics engine though - it recognized this and made the tractor tilt realistically. I guess that's a plus?- I pick up where I left off and my character won't stop moving left. I tried everything short of restarting the game, no dice.- At one tutorial, the tractor just took off by itself.Seriously, if I knew what caused these glitches, I'd avoid them, but I'm finding more and more as I start to play. On a side note, the game looks great, and it seems like this would be a great simulator if, you know, it worked. I'd demand a refund, but I picked it up in a humble bundle. At least my suffering is for a good cause.			"

The learning curve is to high with no real info what to do. You start on a farm guessing what to do next???The tutorial shows only how to drive each veichle. I really miss guides how to manage the farm. ex: some pointers what to do next. Steap by step. Not all are real farmers ;)btw. Not even the achivements work...GET FARMING SIMULATOR 2015 instead you will be amazed how good a farming simulator can be...			"

												Just absolutely terrible... There's potential in the dynamic terrain and general depth of the game, but it's unfortunately so poorly exectuted that even if the game doesn't crash (unlikely), it's still just too glitchy, clippy and generally butt ugly to enjoy. There is also the fact that their main competitor, Farming Simulator 2013, has a huge amount of mods available for it, whereas this game doesn't support mods at all and has very little amounts of real recognisable brand names in-game, besides Fendt.The dream was there, that's without doubt, but the technology required to make that dream come true is just completely non-existant in the game.I'm dissapointed to give this game a mere 2/10, the 2 is for the dream and for getting Fendt onboard the idea, one i'm sure they regret.My advice, play Farming Simulator 2013 instead, this just isn't worth the money (any amount of it).

												I won this in a giveaway, and I try to play and finish every game I win. Unfortunately, the game is bug-ridden as heck. It seems to be purely dependent on luck if the achievements do or don't unlock for you. After completing the first tutorial, the internal achievement unlocked for me, but the Steam achievement did not. A quick look at the logfile showed a possible cause: ""TSteamManager::InitializeManager(): error: could not get key from steam. disconnecting""Going back into the game, the internal achievement has vanished, and does not show again upon finishing the tutorial again. As I understand it, the problems started back in 2014 when UIG changed something about their DRM. For some it works, for others it doesn't. And for those for whom the achievements do work, they unlock seemingly randomly. UIG is infamous for their lack of support. Do not expect this to be fixed in the future. Stay clear if you like 100% achievements on your games.			"

												In this glorious game originally produced in 2003, you play as a magician who has decided to wind down and become a farmer. He uses his magic powers to teleport himself into various vehicles (even ones with doors blocked or are completely flipped over!) and connect parts of machines together from 3 feet away. He can also control objects from a medium range. Sadly, due to corporate greed, only the back half of all of the things available in the game are solid. However, one may easily drive over cattle and make pigs spin to make up for this fact. Vehicles are equipped with amazing features such as having no pedals, having your feet go through the floor, and the brilliant safety feature of being made of rubber. This makes it so when you flip over repeatadly, you simply bounce back up again. Other vehicles can simply ride along the ground sideways with ease. I am excited for the sequel to this glorious game where our wizard has mastered the art of time travel. Perhaps it was hidden in the playgrounds next to the gas station libraries.			"

												At first I was fairly excited to play this game, thinking it would be a change to Farming Simulator 2013, and all the negative reviews for this game put me off playing it for a while, but I decided to give it a go anyway.I can now see why it got so many negative reviews. This game is insanely buggy, pretty sure Goat Simulator has less bugs than this game. I managed to get my tractor stuck on a sheep, and was unable to move.For a 2013 release, this game has incredibly poor graphics, and the screen resolution cannot be changed to 1920x1080, unlike Farming Simulator 2013 which is far superior in all aspects. I wouldn't reccommend this game, or wasting money on, so buy from the Farming Simulator franchise instead.			"

												If you're looking for a good simulator for farming/agriculture, this game is not your game. Perhaps, it may be much better if I WAS ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME RIGHT. The engine is actually really beautiful for a simulator and such, but that comes with a downside. It is terribly optimized. I have a really fair computer that actually meets the recommended requirements, yet I can barely top off 30 fps (frames per second) on medium. In retrospect, I was not able to play this game. I can say that I really don't mind if the graphics are good or not, but when I can't get a respectable fps, it's too hard for me to play.The driving is abyssal with very simple physic calculations, like flipping over a tractor going five MPH and taking a small turn. Sadly, because of my previous woe with the performance, I was not able to try much of the game out, so for those with really powerful computers and want to try this, go ahead, but don't expect much.The game would've been amazing if it wasn't for the ♥♥♥♥-poor performance with the engine.

Again... patched, I might have an entirely different review.			"

												This game has the makings to be really good. The shop has loads of tractors and combines and even has a ford pickup truck. Keeping animals in this game is also a lot more sophisticated than in farming simulator 2013. With 4 maps to choose from Tuscany, Alpine and east and west USA you won't be disappointed, You may ask why am I thumbs downing this game, and that’s because it is unplayable. To start with the game was near impossible to launch. I had to reinstall my PhysX drivers (This seems to be a common issue). Finally after getting the game to work I opened the game to be very disappointed. Just moving the mouse around on the menu is painfully laggy so doing precise things like ploughing is near impossible. I have a high spec Gaming PC with the Latest Nvidia Graphics card, so my hardware is not the issue. It just feels a shame that the game developer has gone to all the effort of making the game what has really good potential yet distributes a unplayable game. "

												I want to like this game but there are two major flaws: It is extremely buggy, especially for a simulator. And two, It lacks direction, you have to frustrate yourself by trying to figure out how to do everything. I'm not saying it needs a four hour tutorial before you spawn in but it would be nice to have some sort of system in place to not only get the player obvious information, but to make sure that the information is suficient and not just one or two sentences unless necessary. I played it some on my older computer but when I downloaded and installed the game on my new very capable computer the game couldn't even complete the initial boot of the game. I can't even get to the main screen of the game. For that, I am not going to recommend this game to others.			"

												Agricultural Simulator 2013 is a cheap rip-off of Farming Simulator 2013 only it crashes more, is more ugly, and labor intenseive. Unless you are willing to spend hours of work at your PC this game is a waste of time. Now im not saying Farming Simulator 2013 is any better with its terrible physics, zombie-like people, and dull gameplay but at least in that game you dont crash every 5 minutes. Honestly if you want a farming simulator look elsewhere it is a niche audience but if you dont mind the things about farming simulator listed above play that insead.			"

												Besides the LACK of updates and or support... Period.The game as was had many issues... but MASSIVE potential to be a big fun.  Now, the game may have been before it's time and a seriously powerful system and video card may have been needed.  You know, the one that is selling for $ 3,000.00 right now might work.... maybe two.  Either way, there were many issues with the game that made it unplayable at times and updates that would break the game from even starting up.It's been quite some time since I even started this but didn't bother after seeing when any updates were performed.  I am guessing this project has been abandoned.  Do not recommend.			"

												Table of Contents:- Foreword- Graphics- Gameplay- Sounds- Controls- Quality- Overall Experience-ForewordI looked at some reviews, most of them saying the game's ♥♥♥♥, some saying its the most amazing Farming Simulator - which is definetly not my opinion. The game feels unpolished, i really expected more after seeing those reviews.-GraphicsThe textures themself were not too bad but required you to be in a range of 30m to even really see them. For example grass, road, tree's.You can look at the screenshot i took when i was ingame. Its basically total sh!t.Btw. the field of view is like 50-60, which is insanely close and feels like sh!t too.-GameplayThe gameplay is pretty bad. I've not played much because my tractor instantly fell over.There was no way to flip it up again, so i was basically ♥♥♥♥ed. To get into the tractor you press leftclick on that little thing that pops up, to get out you press y, whyever...There are like no GUI's, no HUD, if you aim on something like wood there are some little icons popping up which you can click on. I'm personally not a fan of that, but it obviously increases gameplay.-SoundsWell, the music was pretty decent. Not Simulator-like music. Well, its not really the type of music i enjoy though. Kinda reminded me of the game ""Barney"" (where you play that cow, i loved it x3).I didnt really listen to the other sounds, if they were bad  i'd have noticed though. -ControlsThe controls are pretty weird. There are like no GUI's, no HUD, if you aim on something like wood there are some little icons popping up which you can click on. I'm personally not a fan of that, but it obviously increases gameplay. (Sry for copy pasta)-QualityThe overall quality is pretty bad. The game feels insanely unpolished.Like in every UIG Game, it changes the OS-Resolution, even though it's autodetecting stuff to set your video options before starting. Well...The FOV is 50-60 as i said, im not a fan of it.Road only laods when you're in the range of ~30m, otherwise its insanely bugged. Grass does only load in a range of like 10m.There is no HUD or anything, you just get extra menu's by holding TAB, C or other stuff which were pretty confusing.There is no way to flip your tractor, mine's fallen over like 5 minutes after i got into the game. RIP me.-Overall ExperienceDefiently one of the worst faming simulator games out there.There are so many games which are much better and more enjoyable.I would definetly not recommend the game to anyone.

												So, I bought this game once it was available (in beta) on steam. The game was not that bad, but it had some major issues with gameplay. So I was waiting and during that I was able to play it.. more or less.... and after some patch or what.... it was even more broken than before. I couldnt play it anymore. I decided to wait for some patches ? Fixes ? Now after a very loooong time I upgraded my PC. This is compare for games recommended HW configuration and my HW configuration:  Recommended HW My HW   Windows 7 Windows 7 64bit   2.6 GHz Quad Core (Intel Core i5, AMD Phenom X4) 4.00GHz Intel Core i7 4790k   4GB RAM 16GB RAM  Geforce GTX 560 or Radeon HD 7790 GTX 980 4GB  Dx 9.0 Dx 11.1 And the result ? So I'm forced to lower my Graphic setting to medium (to make game run at + - 60FPS 1080p) and my game runs at 1080p with very unstable FPS (18FPS is the lowest I had). I drive around map and my FPS jumping like some bunny.... 18, 40, 30, 50, 60, 40, 30.... LOLz. Very badly optimized game and what is even more sad..... the game developers obviously decided to leave this game as it is and dont bother to come up with some patch to fix this.... nice. Other than that... I think this game have some good potential.... it could be one of the best farming sim games there ever was.... agrar sim 2011 is just one empty boring game.... this game could have been so much better.... there are so many things you can do.... seed, harvest, have animals like sheeps, cows, bulls, horses, feed them, sell them, sell their products, manage your greenhouses, water crops there and much more. I think that those greenhouses in this game are so much more fun to play with than in any other farming sim game.... I was really enjoying it until that patch they once released completely made my game to not run slightly playable anymore. So my rating for this game is like 4/10 - I DO NOT recommend. If you cant play it properly, you cant enjoy it and if you cant enjoy it, there is no reason to buy this game. Right now with my PC I'm slightly able to play it again and it makes it even more sad that developers decided to dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about this game. At the start they seem that they really care about this game... they were actively responding to players in discussion section, were giving some tips on how to make the game run. If you are some game developer and want to release game in beta with bugs and other problems... trust me... it can NEVER end well. Your game will be always the game that was buggy and horrible even when you release patches and fixes to repair it... or if you not... then it will end up like this game. Total disaster. So sad...

If you are some game developer and want to release game in beta with bugs and other problems... trust me... it can NEVER end well. Your game will be always the game that was buggy and horrible even when you release patches and fixes to repair it... or if you not... then it will end up like this game. Total disaster. So sad...

												Well what can I say about Agricultural sim 2013.... I had fun. It was.... How would you say.. Difficult, even on the easy starts. But, just starting with a crap ton of money, buying stuff and goofing off, it's a load of fun. A bit buggy. You really feel like your the only human being alive, or, at least living there. No cars drive, no people walk the sidewalks, just you and your farm. I never figured out how to properly farm, even while trying very hard. Overall, I found it amusing at least. Buy it if you want a cheap screw around game.			"

												The achievments don't work (And once you exit/reload the game, the in-game achevments reset to not acheved), and it's a little laggy, and the turning radius is very... Finiky. I've even got stuck on the edge of a field while working on it a couple times, but other then those minor details, it's pretty fun. Not up to Steam standards, but perfectly good if you're okay with pre-steam pre-acheivment gameplay. I'll be playing more of this soon.			"

Ad not the arcade-look that fs 11/13/15 have. Buuuttt, still enjoy fs 11/13/15. So dont get me wrong. I´ll recomend this game couse it gives endless hours of meditativ-game-state. and it´s a +1 just becouse you can leave the game and do other IRL stuff. Or play a diffrent game on the 2nd screen.  "

												I want to like this game. I want to like it so much, but I can't. For every right thing this game does there are three things done wrong.Most glaringly, the game performs terribly on its higher settings. I have a GTX 770 with a 570 for PhysX, 16 GB RAM, and an i5 overclocked to 4 Ghz. It can't handle AgrarSim 2013 on anything higher than Medium. Know this before playing it.Now on to the gameplay. Common to all the other farming simulations out there, the game's tutorial only cares about teaching you how to operate the machinery. The tutorial doesn't tell you anything about:1. Making fields (you can just plow anywhere, it turns out, and marking them out on the map is only for the benefit of AI workers).2. How and where to sell your harvest (the mill, the town, the agrarian centre).3. How and where to buy the things you need, like animals, seeds, and fertilisers (seed bags from town, seed loads from the agrarian centre, animals from the stables).4. How to buy new equipment (the O key).5. The differences between scenarios (the two hardest scenarios for each map have the same descriptions, but the second one is easier because it gives you an extra $10,000 and some basic machinery).6. Where things are on the map and how to use the map view.7. How to advance to the next day (hold down Ctrl and click on the sun icon near the clock).The game requires a LOT of micro-management. You need to drive your harvest to the sale point. You need to buy individual bags of seed to load the bottom-of-the-line ('historical') seeder, and you need to load those bags into the seeder yourself. There is a grain shower that you can use to load trailers with grain from your silo, but you can't use it to load the historical seeder. You need a gravity hopper to bag your grain so that you can load the seeder. You need to drive your machinery all the way to the agrarian centre to sell it, and in the early game your tractor does an average of 15 mph, so it takes about 10 minutes to travel anywhere.AgrarSim 2013 is also legendary for its crazy physics and unintuitive behaviour. Attachments fall at awkward angles that prevent attachment, and there's no way to rescue or reset them. A several-ton combine harvester can do a backflip when driven over a furrow at 5 mph. The historical seeder can often go nuts and flip your tractor over. There's no way to nudge around an unhitched trailer on foot, so you need to keep adjusting your tractor. If you try to sprint while carrying a seed bag, its collider bumps up against you and slows you down. The on-foot FOV is the narrowest I've ever seen in a video game (45° horizontal), and you will be disoriented for a second or two every time you step off the tractor. The mill won't buy trailers full of grain from you, it only wants bags. A MILL, FOR GOD'S SAKE. And one time I loaded some bags of grain onto a trailer and brought it halfway home, then saved the game and played something else. When I reloaded, the grain bags were gone! Just disappeared into the aether, never to be seen again!And yet for all its massive, unforgiveable problems and its numerous hair-tearing moments of frustration and confusion, AgrarSim offers something you can't get out of any other game right now. Because you see, when you drop a plow into the ground in AgrarSim, it actually digs out a furrow. It's a hole, an excavation, you can stand inside it. And when you drag a cultivator over that land, it smooths the furrows out. The simple act of working the soil is immediate and rewarding, and when you seed it and see your crops springing up there's a great sense of satisfaction and wonder.I think as a gaming experience, this game is worth about $5. As a simulator it's worth about $0.50. The gameplay is just too unpredictable. But it sure is fun to work the land!			"

												Wow, I have to compliment the developers. I'm surprised with these guys on Steam, why Valve isn't out of buisness yet. This is the best game that I have played easily within the last 10 years. Although a very graphically demanding game, it also has revolutionary gameplay that will change the face of gaming. Years from now, people will be wondering if gaming will ever reach the high standards of Agricultural Simulator 2013. Believe the hype, this game constantly pushes the boundaries of quality story, graphics, and gameplay. Every now and then I have to remind myself that this is a game, and I'm not actually farming. Although this is the best game in years, it's not perfect. A beastiality option would be nice... "

												Agricultural Simulator 2013 - Steam Edition, is a simulator that allows you to learn all of the aspects of running a modern farm, from the comfort of your chair. As far as simulators go, it is one of the easiest I've seen in a long time. The tutorial walks you through each step and let's you play through the process of how to hook up and unhook equipment, manage fields and livestock, maintaining your equipment, as well as much more. You are given a choice of 4 different regions to choose from, as well as three different maps. The farm equipment used in-game, is based on actual equipment farmers use,  bringing another immersive level to the game. Campaign mode is available, aside from tutorial missions, and you can also start a new game and build your own fully functioning Agricultural Farm from the ground up with only the bare minimum. Campaign mode has several missions for you to complete, for those want a little more direction, and there are a bunch of different types of crops you can grow. They seem to have a pretty healthy selection, each with their own challenges and rewards. All in all this is a pretty fun simulator, which kind of surprised me. I didn't think farming would actually be fun, but if you like simulator games, this is a good one to try out.			"

												Argricultural Simulator 2013 captures the great life struggle of an ordanary farmer.  You may start out in the game a bit dissapointed by not having much of a variety of vehicles and livestock but you will eventually get out of that rut and enjoy the wide variety of content this game leaves you to unfold.  The game has phenomenal  graphics that are just a pure treatment to the eyes, sometimes i forget im playing a videogame and actually feel as if im outside working on the farm.  The game does a great job at simulating the real world country including several gas stations, stores and etc.  The story of this game is that your father was also a farmer not making much profit throughout your childhood and was eventually stricken with a disease, his final words to you were to tend to the farm and take care of the family.  I'm not going to go into anymore detail on the story because i might spoil the experience for any lucky soul who might purchase this work of art.  All in all Agricultural Simulator 2013 is my favorite game in the Sonic series.			"

Just one more challenging hardcore agricultural simulator. The first thing I found was the AMAZING graphix I couldn't run it at max setting with dual GTX680's! Sometimes you can't even tell if you're playing the game or you are actually farming and lets not forget the amazing physics in this game i mean what trailer doesn't fly away in to space when you bump it!

												Best In Farming! An idyllic farming environment surrounded by inviting & untilled mountain panoramas set in the beautiful landscapes of Tuscany, The Alps and USA await all fans of the Agricultural Simulator series. At their own farm hobby-farmers undertake the daily tasks and challenges of a professional: The production of food, sustainable resources and delivery of eco products all have to be managed. Fields have to be worked and farm animals cared for. The dynamic ground makes the whole game more realistic! Future farmers have to invest tactically and with foresight – the rapid spend of budgets by running costs and seed bills must not be underestimated. To realize a profit takes financial and tactical skill.			"

I decided to give steam the benifit of the dought and wait for them to update the game and work out all of the holes in it. I now realize that that was a mistake because i went to play this game tonight and now it does not even launch at all. I read the comments in the discussion section and find out that this game has been offline since Nov of 2013! Well steam it has been 2 years and 4 months since this game has not been working. Why have i not been refunded for this game that is completely useless? Not only that but you are still selling this game to people on your website. Last time i checked that is fraud. This situation is completely unacceptable. SHAME ON YOU for not refunding the customeres that have this game that won't even do anything and for continuing to sell it.

												There is a reason the promotional video only shows vehicles moving about 10ft forward as a maximum, because if you drive further than this, the chances of you passing through the hard programmed space-time distorter and finding the laws of physics as you'd come to understand them turned upside down, grows exponentially with every passing second. You will eventually find yourself bouncing across your neatly ploughed field on the roof of your tractor, wondering who pulled the plug on reality.As a simulation of agriculture 2/10 (there are farmyard animals, which I suppose must count for something, they have something to do with farms, right?). As a simulator of altered reality and of how agriculture might look in a universe of metaphysical vehicles that only exist conceptually, a physics dominated by a fluctuating gravitational force and where Albert Einstein toured his one-man balloon sculpting show from coast to coast 11.3333333333/10.

												I just wanted to write this down in case I die in my sleep tonite. Heed my warning: Agricultural Simulation 2013 is beyond my mortal comprehension. I have now seen the true face of evil.The best part of this game was the menu screen, and just because it was in HD. And it had a tractor in it. I was sceptic at best, but proceeded to selection screen. ""Hmm, Tuscany, that seems nice enough"", I thought to myself. Without any ceremonies, the game dumps me onto a courtyard filled with chickens, multiple buildings, a dog and a tractor. In glorious 3D, except ran through multiple gaussian blur filters.Chickens flee at my wake as I run around the yard for a while. I take my hands off the keyboard, and my farmer alter ego keeps running. I disconnect gamepad and joystick, to no avail. Dog on the yard barks as I strafe around the yard, unable to stop. I try to steer myself towards the tractor standing in the corner of the yard, but I just climb over the damn thing and keep on running. Finally, after fiddling around with sound (wtf?!) options, I manage to disable the mystical autopilot feature.I fiddle around with tractor for a while, managing to fire it up. The farmer is walking faster than the damn machine, so I just ditch it. I start rummaging through the multitude of various buildings around. I find some supplies from the cellar of my house. Items vanish into thin air as the farmer uses his nifty jedi powers to move sacks, milk containers and crates of fruit around.I spot some livestock on the other side of the yard. Apparently I have some cows, a horse and a sheep or two. They make funny sounds when you click them. After few clicks I realize I have now managed to lock my horse into infite rotating loop. Few short moments later all my livestock are rotating around like some ♥♥♥♥ed up experimental farm yard merry-go-round. The display is too grotesque to behold, so I close the pen behind me, jump onto my trusty Massey-Ferguson and ride out of the farm.Massey charges forward like a crippled manatee. I manage to enable autopilot again, and the top speed settles around 10. Mph or Kph, I have no clue. Running would be faster, but I dare not to challenge the wilds by foot. I take a smoke break. Get some late night snack. Take a leak. I come back to find massey around 100m away from the farm. In my frustration, I steer right, and all the rules of physics and universe fly out of the window. Massey's nose goes up, right around it's axle, and I land the vehicle upside down. My farmer doesn't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ as the camera clips inside his skull, apparently the weight of the tractor doesn't really bother him.At this point, I pressed escape, exited the game, uninstalled it and removed it from my Steam game list.
