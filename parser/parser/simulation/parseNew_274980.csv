												Before you buy this game, make sure you are buying it for the RIGHT reasons. This game is amazing, exactly the kind of learning style I love and was looking for. BUTIf you are buying this game to learn how to speak fluently (For me, fluent Japanese) by solely relying on this game and nothing else, you will be very disappointed.If you are buying this game as just one of the many tools to help you learn a language, and you consider yourself a visual learner, then this is perfect in my opinion. Being able to click any object in the house and instantly be told what it is called, is the next best thing to having a native speaker with you while you point at things asking what they are called. As a huge plus with using the game, you see how it is written; in Romaji, Hiragana, or Kanji depending on what you pick if learning Japanese, which helps a lot more for me personally than just hearing audio alone. Oh and I highly recommend only using Kana instead of Romaji, you will be glad you did in the long run.The time challenge mode turns the game into a scavenger hunt, making your brain work to remember what each thing is called. I feel that having to recall something, especially with a clock counting down, helps you memorize the words.Alongside basic nouns from clicking on things in the environment, you can also unlock adjectives and verbs associated with each noun. I really like that because it adds context in a way; like clicking on the word ""bed"" has the verb ""to sleep"" available to learn. So in the end, please use this game as a wonderful tool to master your language alongside your many other tried-and-true methods. I am certainly enjoying it and I feel I am memorizing the words much quicker than looking at definitions in a book. The audio is also very clear and easy to understand.As for any negatives, I just have a few suggestions rather than anything actually negative. It would be nice if you could do the time challenge mode where objects light up and you have to type in what the object is called, or maybe choose from a multiple choice list. Right now it is just one direction, you hear the word and click the right object, never the other way around. Also if there was an option to have the speaker say the word again but slowly, to catch those quick syllables.Weather you decide this game is for you or not, please go out there and learn a new language! Trust me, it feels amazing! :)ATTENTION, NEED TO KNOW TIPS: When doing the time challenge, you have to DOUBLE click an object to select it as your answer. I don't think it tells you that, or I didn't notice. :) Double clicking outside of the game mode, will bring up a window with more details on that object/word you are clicking. Also, when you click on your vocab list, click a word, and there is a little ""eye"" icon you can click to see what the word is in your native language. I also HIGHLY recommend reading all the hints at the top left of the screen to get the most out of this game, it doesn't take long to read them all. Have fun all!			"

												Ok, so this game seemed great at first glance. The whole concept of studying language while playing a videogame probably seems fantastic for every gamer like me, who also likes to broaden his knowledge everyday. However, Influent isn't what I expected it to be. I didn't do much research before buying, just a short review by someone who generally praised the game but mentioned lack of insight on japanese ""kanji"", which immediately put japanese pack off my to-buy list. Therefore for starters, I picked up french pack. After a bit more than 1 hour of playtime, I can pretty much say that for me the game is a large disappointment. The whole game is situated in a small condo which contains about 400 different objects that you can interract with, and consequently learn more about them in order to improve your vocabulary. Those consist mostly out of basic household items.In French, gender is of crucial importance, and although the game tells you which gender a certain object is, when you actually learn them, gender pronouns or indefinite articles are excluded from the actual word. For example instead of ""une lampe"" or ""la lampe"" you'll study ""lampe"", which means you'll still need to study gender separatly. Furthermore, the game doesn't cover one bit of grammar. The game itself isn't particularly fun either, since one is as already mentioned, trapped inside a small condo. If the game would include also some other everyday areas like playground, trainstation, gym, school etc. it would vastly improve the vocabulary covered, but I'm afraid this will either never be available or will be purchasable as a ""dlc"", for which I honestly wouldn't waste a cent anymore since I don't consider the 400 foreign words to be worth of 10€, while you can learn them for free in (in a sense of content) much better covered ""game"" called Duolingo, or Anki.Summary: I love the basic idea, but it lacks a lot of content. Although it is obviously considered as a supplement to your language studies, I still believe that it could've included a lot more than just bare 400 words.			"

												So far, 30% of the words have been loan-words (katakana). The rest are alternatives to the same word; verbs, which losely apply to the nouns they're tied to; and maybe 10% are adjectives which are the only thing I can imagine being useful in everyday speech.You're confined to a tiny apartment and although you can open cupboards and drawers you find mostly duplicate items of what's laying around. There are no ways to look out into the world beyond the apartment and nothing to offer beyond basic vocabulary that you can get for free at a site like Memrise.com "

												GREAT CONCEPT BUT LACKING CONTENTFirst off you must understand this is a vocabulary learning game and nothing more. If you dont have another form of learning the language this game is pretty much useless. I got this to brush up on french I had learned in high school. I paid $5 for it on sale and even at that price felt slightly disappointed. I had no idea you would be restricted to a one bedroom apartment with access to only learning 400 mundane names of household items. If this game was expanded to a small town type environment where you could go to say the store, a trainstation, etc. This game would be 5 stars, If a DLC was released with at least an equal number of new words in a new environment i would consider paying another $5 for it.

												Influent is not useful for learning a new language. Walk through a landscape and learn a smattering of nouns for household objects and nothing else. No grammer rules, no other words, no cultural context. Can you guys even understand how useless that is? Learning how to say random words for objects you will probably not need to talk about without ever communicating anything about them whatsoever?Hell, you wll never need most of these nouns as a beginning student  of a foreign language anyways. It would be far more useful to simply learn how to say ""How do you say this?"" in whatever language you are learning so you can learn words that are actually useful to you.I learned way more useful information on youtube videos in an hour than I ever did with this.The only good thing about this is the soundtrack by Lifeformed. It is the soundtrack from the game Dustforce and it is truly excellent. I have no idea why it is in this product.You will not learn how to communicate a single complete thought or simple sentence with this software .			"

												(This review is about the German version of the game)Numerous items in this game can be highlighted separately despite not having own words associated to them (for example parts of a light switch), numerous words are pronounced weirdly, there are multiple speakers pronouncing them and at least one of them is really bad at the language, some German nouns chosen only fit poorly, and some are flat out wrong (flowers in their pots are surrounded by ""garbage""...; ""bottles"" become ""cans""), while the 'synonyms' listed leave much to be desired.A good few of the objects in the game are also extremely American, like extensive baseball equipment, or skateboards, and won't be seen in many of the countries whose languages the different DLCs aim to help with.Considering how long this has been on Steam without such things being rectified, I can't assume that any of the above will be fixed in further patches.Before the ""screen"" becomes a ""computer"", I can't quite view this as jolly.It gets downright infuriating in the time attack tests when it asks you for a ""pen"", and it actually wants the ""pencil"", while the ""pen"" is viewed as wrong (bonus: only the pencil can ""write"", the pen can't...), or when it wants a ""lamp"", and the ""light"" is seen as a fundamentally different creature.Edit:By now, I've found dozens of wrongly pronounced words, as well as a bunch with wrongly assigned genders.

												Influent is a great idea. Though it does need some refining, it's a very helpful and affordable option for begginer to intermediate language learners.If your only goal is to verbally pick up new key nouns and verbs for a trip abroad, Influent will suffice. However for more in-depth learners who wish to read it's best paired with good old fashioned studying. A primary example of this is that it won't help you understand how to actually read any languages that use non-roman-based characters (e.g. Russian, Chinese, Japanese). Note that you can enable english readings of any language if literacy isn't your primary goal.I'm very excited to see a real game for language learning, instead of tedious and very over-priced software (Yeah, I'm looking at YOU, Rosetta Stone). I sincerely hope to eventually see DLCs or updates that will allow users to explore the world outside of the small apartment, add more unique yet commonplace items for each culture, or perhaps interact with NPCs to practice dialouge...crossing my fingers and keeping and eye on this game ;)Pros: Playble area is filled to the brim with hundreds of everyday objects to study, DOES include verbs that will unlock as you learn nouns that they're relevant to, affordable, a highly customizeable and unique learning experience.Cons: Small environment, UI is almost too minimalistic (can't cycle though word details; have to return to vocab list), and you can only learn commonplace North American items (useful but limited).

												This game offers a lot of opportunities to expand your vocabulary through fun challenges. If you purchased a few languages, you must select which one you want to start with first; I started with Korean and will later pick up more. Once you select the language (Korean) for example, you have the choice to also select Hangul. Once the game starts you are in an apartment, with lots of household items and the learning begins. As you move around (Limited interaction with the items) you can select items and learn the name in the language you purchased. There you can see the English translation, pronunciation, image, spelling, noun and verb versions of the word. Once you have found a few words you are comfortable with you can start adding them to your list, you can then play these challenges like ""time attack"" which test you in your ability to locate the items; either they are said to you, you read them without assistance of pronunciation of the software meanwhile you are being ""tested"" in speed/accuracy. There is a lot more this game has to offer through these challenges and I recommend getting comfortable with a few set of words before adding more to your list. There is no rush and after each challenge you get a percentage but no penalization for failing. There is also a ""To do list"" which makes it easier for you to know what challenges you need to complete and they are not meant to be done in any particular order. Overall I have played this game for only a few hours and am enjoying it. It is a relaxed, straightforward, fun way to learn a set of words in a new language. The price is good and the only thing I would want added is the chance to explore more areas (more locations) this would allow me to expand on my vocabulary besides household items. Next Phase of Influent?An added software in conjunction with this one; Once we have the words learned take us to the next ""Learning phase"" Learning how to use them in a sentence, this would help us with the ability to actually use the words and have a conversation. The price is good for what this game offers. An added sweet bonus would be steam trading cards even though it is educational software. Final thoughtsIt is not meant to teach you a whole new language but help you expand on your vocabulary. It does make the learning process of learning new vocabulary fun and I would recommend this game. Will be adding screenshots soon!			"

												Depending on the language you're learning, learning and retaining vocabulary may be the biggest part of learning a language. Especially if the language contains grammar you're already familiar with. This is essentially who Influent is for. Those wishing to learn vocabulary in a totally new and unique way. You play as just a teenager living in an apartment. You go through your apartment filled with HUNDREDS of items (seriously he may have a hoarding problem). You click on the object to view the word and you double click it to learn more about it (the pronunciation / noun / verb / gender of word, etc.). From a game standpoint, it's nothing special. The greatness of this game comes from the language learning aspect. I chose Latin as I have been learning Latin for the past few years so I can't really comment on native pronunciation (as it is a dead language). However, the pronunciation for the Latin course is definitely on par with every other course I have been through and a lot of work has evidently been put into making pronunciation amazing. You're paying $9.99 essentially for a virtual world that makes learning vocabularly in another language EASY and FUN. These two things are the most important factors that lead me to believe anyone who buys and plays this will come out that much more knowledgable in their target language. I would recommend 'Influent' for mainly two types of people:1. Those who have a good beginners / intermediate grasp in their target language and now wish to learn a lot more vocabulary2. Those who just wish to dabble or have fun in a different language while still learning and retaining good information.I would not recommend this game to people who:1. Wish to achieve fluency from this2. Want anything more than a giant virtual dictionaryI would also be wary buying this game if your target language uses a non-Latin alphabet and you have no knowledge in the language (Korean, Japanese, Mandarin). Reason being is that you are not taught how to read the alphabet of your chosen language. The first thing I would advise Japanese and Korean learners to do is to learn the alphabet first and it will be much easier later on. As for Chinese (Mandarin) learners, learn up on how Chinese characters are written (particularly radicals) before purchasing or delving in to this game.From a gaming standpoint $9.99 is a ripoff for this game; however, it is intended as a LANGUAGE LEARNING program merely using a game as its platform. And $9.99 for this game from a language standpoint is a REMARKABLE price. This is essentially the same principal as Rosetta Stone (learning vocabulary / phrases with no grammar or alphabet learning). I HIGHLY recommend this game.			"

												Influent is the best 'gamification' of vocabulary learning I have come across. I have spent over 10 hours with the Russian edition, I hesitate to call it a game so I'll say ""application"". Reading the negative reviews I am dissapointed with the community. You are simply a fool if you think you can just 'play' this and somehow become fluent or even remotely competent in your chosen language. Even a basic level of comprehension takes at least a year to develop with a lot of hard work involved in that year.Influent will not teach grammar, it is simply and audio/visual application that softens the monumentual blow of learning hundreds of foreign words. Personally I have found it incredibly useful. It works by giving you control of an avatar in a typical apartment, you can swap between third and first person to explore and click on items to have a native speaker exclaim what the items is and you're also given a textual display of the item. You can then choose to add the item to a vocab list and once you add 10 items it completes the list and allows you to come back at any point to attempt a 'Time Attack' where the items in the list are randomised, the native speaker announces what item they want you to find.I highly recommend Influent as an AID to your language learning, not the only source.

												This is a 'made for kickstarter', junk game. The game raised enough money to be profitable before it was available, so it was released without content and doesn't do anything but look good on an advertisement. There is no talk about increasing the functionality or vocabulary of the game on the product website, and it's not even worth the small price on steam.The entire game can be boiled down to this: Hear and/or read a word, and then click on the thing that the word is associated with.I have nearly completed my first entire language pack in about two days (there's like 5 words I can't seem to locate). I don't feel like I've actually learned anything though. The 420 words available are not enough to order dinner, let alone take a vacation in a foreign land. This game does not teach a person how to begin to communicate in a new language, which is the only thing the game had to deliver after getting over twice the requested amount on kickstarter. They got their funding though, so the only news is that they intend to release more language packs.Other problems:-This game takes way too much video card effort for the type of game it is, and it will begin lagging to death after playing for an hour or so.-Does not understand multiple monitors, so it tries to plaster the game centered on total composite screen (hit F11 to get windowed FS on main monitor)-The spaceship mode is completely stupid, and is there simply for marketing purposes. It's the same as FPS mode, except you have to hold the mouse button for a while instead of doubleclicking, and you can't stop to aim (since you're flying). Some of the targets are tiny though.-The game was designed so that new language packs could be made in a day, with fill-in-the-blanks labels and audio snippets, but little effort was made to do a good job. There is often two words for an item without an explanation for which word to use when. The spoken words are often poorly pronounced and with anomalous noise artifacts. I suspect they found their voice actors on craigslist.-Sloppy positional audio often makes words hard to hear when it should really just be monaural (since you're effectively listening to a voice in your head).-Stripped down settings and options. Doesn't even have volume control, and doesn't remember major settings (like window placement and windows audio mixer settings)			"

An okay tool with several drawbacksHaving years of university training and real-life experience in teaching not only foreign language but also second language acquisition classes, I can say that Influent can work well as an additional teaching tool to the ones learners already have, provided the players know what they’re doing and are aware that Influent is not actually teaching them how to speak the target language; It merely trains them in recognizing words from that language. Given that, Influent is fairly okay at achieving what it’s supposed to do and I can see it helping certain learner types, although at the same time, it is likely to be just a waste of money to a lot of people, especially as there are products out there that are much better at helping people learn foreign languages. The major drawback being that Influent does not teach grammitcal articles (grammatical gender) for European languages. More about that further down.Primary Issues of the softwareInfluent (2016) was developed by the US American game designer Rob Howland and published with the help of his alma mater, the University of Tsukuba (筑波大学), and Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (文部科学省【MEXT / 文科省】). Sadly, despite the academic support behind this project, its issues are clearly visible right away and it is very obvious that Howland does not have a linguistic background. The protagonist in the game simply translates nouns or adjective-adverbs from English into the target language and it is limited to objects inside the virtual apartment.To highlight what I mean, we can briefly look at the impressively handy, elaborate, yet slim Langenscheidt’s picture dictionaries, which contain words, transliterations, pictures (and if you own the TING pen even audio clips of proper pronunciation) of local foods, instruments, sports, holidays, animals, tools, jobs, lab & hospital equipment, body parts, family members, ethnic groups in the target culture, climate zones, and so on and so on and it even includes the necessary vocabulary for any occasion reaching from birthdays to funerals or visits to the barber shop or the postal office. And it is merely twice the price of Influent's base game despite offering that much more. Not only that, the roughly 300 page book can even be brought with you, so if you don’t know a word, you can show it to people.Influent on the other hand is limited to objects inside the virtual apartment (as can be seen on the store page’s screenshots) and the vocabulary is very narrow, albeit very useful. It can even be argued that one could simply use a normal dictionary and a language tandem to probably achieve equivalent if not superior results.


The interface is okay, although I very quickly forgot what to click to have the game do what I want. 
A Screenshot of Influent
By: Gao Li




Gameplay mechanicsThe player can move the protagonist around a virtual apartment, click on objects, listen to how they’re pronounced and look at how they’re spelled in the target script or how they’re transliterated into Romaji, Romaja, or Hànyǔ Pīnyīn (depending on the language pack). Additionally, the player can create vocabulary lists and make his / her own quizzes. The game will then show and say a term and the player will have to click on the correct item in the room. You can pretty much achieve the same effect by pasting post-its around your actual apartment and by having a smartphone dictionary app pronounce certain terms for you, in case you forget how to say them.You could say that doing that in the game would be less work for you, but writing down new vocabulary, having to use / activate different areas of your brain (to write it down and to read the word) leaves a much bigger, better imprint of the target word in your memory than merely reading it and having the computer program pronounce it for you.Critique and conclusionThere are multiple issues when it comes to Influent, first of all, there are products out on the market that are much better than Influent and cost about the same, so I suggest going out to bookstores and checking them out before buying this. Of course it's definitely possible that they don't have any better alternatives in your area, in which case Influent might be good. Secondly, when learning a language, you usually learn four basic fields: Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking. Influent can only provide the two “passive” skills, reading and listening, you still need a training partner or a formal education to learn (or at the very least have someone correct) the writing and speaking parts. If you cannot find a partner in your area, there are multiple online forums and websites that focus on connecting people for specifically that purpose alone. Influent will also not teach you anything about sentence structures, tenses, clauses or (in-)formal language, in fact, it will not teach you anything beyond the available vocabulary.When it comes to European languages with grammatical gender, Influent will also not provide you with the necessary grammatical articles (Der, Die, Das in German, for example). Let's say you click on the bed, Influent will merely play an audio clip saying ""Bett"" while showing the correct spelling, but it won't say ""Das Bett"", which would definitely have been the better choice. Grammatical gender is essential for many European languages, ommiting that means that learners will lack crucial communication skills.I can see Influent work as something you use besides the learning tools you already have (like school- and exercise books as well as audio tapes or movies), especially when trying to learn gender neutral languages, but it definitely isn’t enough to learn a language with. I like the digital / game approach to learning languages, however the execution isn’t perfected yet and still needs some work.			"

												You are locked in your apartment until you can recite every object in another language.What's the [insert language] word for HELP!------------------------------------------Essentially you walk around an apartment suite adding common household objects to your vocabulary inventory which serves as a sort of self-pacing mechanism. Find them all and you will learn how to say 420 words in another language, (284 nouns, 68 adjectives and 68 verbs,) all you have to do is retain them all.If anthing this will most certainly serve to give you a basic understanding of pronounciation in a more interactive and engaging way than listening to someone repeating the same words on an audio cassette.Do audio cassettes give you achievements for learning words in another language? No.Does this game teach you necessary fundamentals in another language? Not really.Will you learn how to say words like ""lotion,"" ""nuts"" and ""ceiling fan""? Absolutely!			"

												INFLUENT on PC 8/10 Tested with the Spanish DLCThe bottom line: Learning vocabulary was a lot of fun and every student of a new language will find pleasure in this title. For intermediate students the magic in a language is learning verb conjugation and you will need to find this elsewhere.Mechanics:Walk around a 3D apartment and poke household objects to reveal their name. Every 10 object names form a List; repeat the List 3 times correctly and you have mastered those 10 words. Repeat until you find and master all 420 object names.This 'game' works because You get to choose which ten words to learn next; you made the choice and this engages the mind....  It’s a bargain price for learning 420 words so quickly, don’t miss out.  100% Steam Achievements in Spanish took 14 hours; my mother tongue is English and I am fluent in French. Next week I will try Japanese and I suspect it will take much longer....My wishlist to the devs: Find a way to create a verb conjugation module, and an advanced vocabulary module…. I would definitely buy. I think you are on to something good.Oct 2015			"

												At the time of writing this review, I've mastered all 420 words the game has to offer, and completed all the tasks on the 'To Do' list. I played the English version of the game, so that's the one I'll be reviewing. I also own the Japanese pack, but I haven't completed that one yet.One thing I'd like to start with is that 'Influent' never advertises, nor does it claim to make one fluent in any of the languages available here (and I double checked this). The description of the game here on the store page clearly states that it is a game focused on VOCABULARY ACQUISITION and PRONUNCIATION. It never claims to teach one grammar, syntax, conversation, or any other facet of language. I feel like a lot of people thought 'Influent' was a full-blown language learning tool, which it is not. The negative reviews here are unnecessary and uncalled for. Having addressed that, let's move on to the actual thing.  The setting of the game is limited to the main character's apartment. You can explore his room, the bathroom, living room, and the kitchen. The point of the game is simple: as you explore, you're expected to click on various items that you encounter and collect vocabulary. Upon clicking on an item, you hear the word as it's spoken by a native speaker, and you can find more information about it such as its word class, phonetic transcription, synonyms, or you can just add it into your vocab list. In total, there are 420 words to collect — but in reality — there's ""only"" 284 items that you physically come across in the game. These items mostly consist of normal household articles, but there are some small surprises here and there like a cat nestled on the chair of the protagonist. As of now, there are no other locations available, and the words are very basic in nature — so don't expect to turn into a walking dictionary just by playing this. The game WILL equip you with a very nice elementary vocab though.One thing that I particularly liked was the fact that certain words feature synonyms, and the player has the ability to switch between them (e.g. you can decide whether you want to call soft drink a ""soda"" or a ""pop"" as both are commonly used in the U.S., although ""soda"" is preferred in the West Coast). I thought this was a nice touch. Another thing that I really liked was the whole unlocking system which allows the player to acquire new words in the form of adjectives and verbs that are usually applicable to the nouns connected with them — ""usually"" being the key word here as some choices seemed extremely random (e.g. ""beer"" is apparently ""disgusting""). Another thing of note is that 'Influent' teaches American English, and there's no option to switch to British English. The vocabulary and the pronunciation reflect that. So, this may put off students of British English, even though it shouldn't bother them that much. Speaking of pronunciation, the game uses the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) to transcribe English words in order to show how they're really pronounced. That's all neat and great, but there are some truly odd transcriptions for many of the words featured  in the game. Not wrong, just a tad nonstandard. In some cases, I thought the transcriptions in the game actually reflect how the words sound in real life much better than what you usually find in dictionaries. For instance: calendar, magazine, and milk were transcribed as [ˈkæl-ɛn-dəɹ], [mei-ɡə-ˈzin], and [mɪəlk] instead of the more traditional [ˈkæl-ən-dəɹ], [mæ-ɡə-ˈzin], [mɪlk]. However, the /ɔ/ vowel is frequently confused with the /oʊ/ diphthong, and so you get funny transcriptions like ['fɔ-tʌ-gɹæf] for ""photograph,"" [pɪlɔ] for ""pillow,"" and even ['skeit-bɔʊɹd] for ""skateboard."" Some transcriptions left me puzzled - for example:  [ˈkæɹ-pɪt] for ""carpet,"" [ˈwɑʊ-lɪt] for ""wallet,"" and [ˈbʌl-ə-'tɛn-bɔɹd] for ""bulletin board."" There are also words in which the stress mark is often placed on the wrong syllable, e.g. [pɪk'tʃʊɹ] or [flʌ-'fi]. I'm honestly quite surprised nobody's pointed this out yet. So, this might get a bit annoying — especially if you're already accustomed to different transcriptions.All in all, I thought 'Influent' was an extremely auspicious effort — one that could potentially become one of the best language learning tools out there. It'd be great to see new content and locations added into the game, and something tells me that we will. There's certainly a lot of room for improvement, but the groundwork had been laid and it is very solid. While it won't make one fluent, it is a brilliant supplement to, say, an elementary level textbook.			"

												Influent is a language learning game in which you wander around a 3D, cartoony rendering of a small flat, identifying everything you see in a foreign language.  The spatial aspect of the game is interesting and does help you remember nouns, and the timed trials to find a list of objects is pretty good as a challenge.  However, the way adjectives and verbs are handled is... interesting.  They're assigned to related nouns, in a way that spans from obviously good to downright confusing.  I think maybe with a lot of practice this system might make a bit more sense but I never got there.The real killer for this as an educational application is that there is not nearly enough content.  300 words is not even remotely near enough - XKCD's famous Up Goer Five uses the top 1000 words, and you need about 3000 words to be able to put vaguely sane sounding sentences together.  I can get that this isn't a full language learning application (there's no grammar at all) and that's fine.  But considering all this does is teach you vocabulary, despite its other strengths, this game just doesn't teach you enough vocabulary to be useful.  So despite the endearing art style, the slick Dustforce-esque soundtrack and the cool concept, this game needs an order of magnitude more content to be anywhere near worth its asking price (£7 last I checked).  And remember, that's *just* for vocabulary.  To pick an example to contrast, Duolingo does grammar, idiomatic usage, full text translation, pronunciation guidance *and* a much wider range of vocab, on a portable platform, for free.  If you're intereseted in educational games, maybe have a look at this for an example of a slick product that partially succeeds, with ideas worth considering.  But if you're actually trying to learn a language, this does far too little of just a narrow slice of what you need to be of significant use.			"

												This game is somewhat interesting for learning simple vocabulary, but it doesn't have any other elements to it. I wish there were minigames for grammar or ways to learn vocabulary from different locations (work, school, etc). As it is, it's not really helpful for learning language. I have to go back through every word I clicked on the previous time I played or I don't remember anything.			"

												Okay, time to make history.Note: This review is for Japaneese version of the gameMy first contact with Influend was weird. I was like ""oh, another learning game, probably not interesting"". though I tried it anyway and it turned out to be something better than ""just a learning game"". First of all - it is not boring. It even has a plot, you know. You are an independent inventor whose prototype machine named Senjun...dammit, the name of that prototype is too hard to write. So yeah, in order to prove it he wants to learn 300 words in one of the languages. You can buy the game with one language and then buy the rest of languages as cheaper DLCs - I like the idea.Let's get to the real action. You are in your flat, filled with 420 (blaze it) things. Basically the goal is to walk around and interact with things to see their name. It's a good system in my opinion, since when you look at the thing you know what it is and you get the name in the other language. But not only that, you can also get synonyms and adjectives for some of those too (and in case of Japaneese - how the things I written. I felt good with romaji)! You can see that hard work was put into that, because there's also a native speaker saying the word out loud too! Anyway, after getting to know names of stuff int he room you can try Time Attack mode - it's all about ""mastering the words"" and choosing the right things. After you master 50 words - SURPRISE, YOU CAN FLY AROUND THE ROOM AND SHOOT STUFF WITH LAZERS! So it's not only learning after all.Now, a few words about graphics - game doesn't look bad, I like its art style. It is kinda like in comics, so that's a plus. Some of the texutes are less detailed, but that's only things that you can do much with. And they're usually placed in some corners and places normal human doesn't usually visit (unless he's a nerdy RPG player that has to visit every corner).Other stuff - you will probably spend more time looking at numerous references that are hidden withing the game. I really liked book on the table. Get the game (it's not that expensive, especially when you see the amount of content and educational value of it. Really, educational games can be damn good and this one is the example of it) and see it.BUT - every rose has its thorns. It took me some time to get used to controls. You can switch in this game between TPP and FPP modes, but when in FPP zooming in has to be with mouse wheel instead of good ol' FPS right-click (it is assigned for different function). Apart from getting to know controls, rest is good. Even tutorial (you can skip it and get to know controls by yourself - not suggested).To sum up, I loved that game since 10 minutes after launching it. And I actually learned that pillow in japaneese is ""makura"".And yeah, this thing is definitely worth getting.Rating: 9+/10 - grab it, grab it while it's hot! "

												using the french versionthe gameplay mechanics are really good and I've even learned a few words. however, the trailer and some of the advertising for language packs clearly indicates outdoor environments. but your trapped in your apartment the whole time because the front door wont open. this is a major glitch that needs to be resolved.would recommend if there were more environments.UPDATE: In response to the developer's comment;there is a sequence in the trailer where the character is animated walking past flowers and a mailbox while using the device. i think i can safely say you will not even learn the word for mailbox in this game so potential buyers should know that this is not representative of the actual scope of the game. But thats beside the point. while the game does have tremendous potential, i cant recommend it with such a limited environment. it gets old really fast and will only help you learn a ton of vocab for describing a bunch of random things in a (very) tiny apartment. most of the vocab just isnt very useful. i recommend less emphasis on developing further language packs and more focus into developing more environments.tl;drThe concept is Good. However, while 400 words might sound like a lot, i quickly found myself bored and frustrated with the limited scope of the apartment. most definitely would recommend iff there were more environments.

												Helluva lot cheaper than Rosetta stone =)More fun too.It definitely works, I learned my first 10 words pretty quickly and had fun while doing it.I do wish the area to explore was bigger - I was feeling pretty claustrophobic and I don't even have that fear.the rooms are small and packed with stuff so it's easy to pick what to learn quickly. Great for learning but after 10 minutes or so I wanted to break down the door and scream ""I'm free!!!!!""The only thing they really should add is the ability to remove words from your vocab or to at least pick and choose which words from your vocab to focus on. From what I can tell if you add a word by hitting space or double clicking the item there doesn't seem to be a way to remove it.			"

												The idea to learn language while doing something fun is great, but... It can't be like in this game. There is no actual goal (except for time attack mode). If it had some kind of quests, where you have to learn a word or a sentence to get further it would have been more useful. Like this - it's pointless. You just walk around and click on things. I believe it would be cheaper to get a simple old-school vocabulary. Or like Lingvo...I reemmber, when I was learning English there was a game for native English speaker to learn ther language. I mean for kids. It even had a story, a whole map and a bunch of playable characters. Gameplay was made of moving through map and solving different puzzles and or playing mini-games, where you had to find a correct word suiting the situation, make a sentence. Some games were simply for learning new words or even some grammar rules. Too bad I do not remember the name of the game =(Oh, and yes, I just played a fewminutes to realise, that this is NOT an educational material. So do not be alarmed by the 0hr stamp.			"

												Only useful for learning vocab. I know that this game makes it very clear that it will only teach you vocab words, but a lot of people bought it hoping for a good way to start learning a language. No software that exists, even comprehensive ones like rosetta stone, can't teach you a language quickly or thoroughly (no matter what the commercials say). This game utilizes visual and audio cues to increase your vocabulary pretty effectively, but don't bother with it unless you already have an understanding of the language or are currently taking a class.

												Influent is a great pastime for all language learners out there. Be warned, though: Influent is only about words. Forget the detailed explanation and examples given by Duolingo. Influent only tells us the gender of the words, their writing and their pronunciation.This is not necessarily a bad thing as the interaction with objects (image association) greatly helps learn all the words. The very early on unlocked ""Time Attack"" mode tests our knowledge by randomly picking objects we've already found. Well, random is not a must but it is best not to test our short-term memory so let Influent pick from the entire list as it sees fit! Naturally, the more words we add to our vocabulary the greater challenge it will be to remember them.To make it harder we can hide the text and force ourselves to listen closely to the recorded audio. Adjectives and verbs are not available at the beginning; by successfully completing the challenges we earn stars - these can then be spent to unlock the related words. Note that some of the objects are tricky to find: by pressing ctrl we can look at objects in a more detailed way. For instance, looking at the bed only yields us the word bed itself but by pressing ctrl the words mattress, bed frame, pillow and cover sheet can, too, be learned. This child-parent relationship adds extra fun to the exploration. The computer on the guy's desk is another example: pressing ctrl makes the keyboard, mouse, speaker and display available.Pros:--- A great way to help us learn a new language or improve upon our existing knowledge.--- Objects are many and varied: thanks to Influent I'll surely remember the word stapler in French. :)Cons:--- Only 420 words... the apartment is nice but we could go elsewhere. For instance, we could visit the parents at their house which would allow us to see the garden. A house also has a cellar and a loft thereby allowing us to learn more. Not to mention the added pets or other animals as in the flat we only have a cat. --- Expensive. I find 10 euros a bit much for one language pack. Duolingo is free which lacks this image association technique with the interactive gameplay but greatly makes up for it with more topics and - most of all - grammar.Still, Influent is a great concept and hopefully it'll be expanded upon with new words & places to visit!

												Influent is an edutainment title that tries to ""gamify"" the language learning process by placing you in a virtual room filled with stuff that you click and learn their names and associated adjectives and verbs. The world space is very limited and only presents the inside of an apartment, and sadly there is no word association or sentence building exercises. Additionally, there are still some serious glitches and bugs littered across the game, including some serious memory leaks, slowdowns and poor design decisions.Influent has a LOT of potential if the developer manages to include additional spaces (maybe girlfriend's apartment, a convenience store or work place?) with more involving word association games. As it stands now, there is very little meat on these bones, and I hesitate to recommend it if you are seriously pursuing a new language. 3/5 until further notice.			"

												I'd definitely recommend this game for people who want to expand their vocabulary, but there are a few things I'd like to point out.-While this is almost never required for romance languages, in Japanese, Chinese and Korean, words, Especially adjectives and verbs, can be synonymous but imply different things. This is almost always the case in Japanese, where verbs have transitive and intransitive forms, but this is not listed in the definition, only one form is presented. This means doing research on the word you'll find yourself using more will help you be more fluent in the long run.-So much katakana... I'd like to see really rare kanji forms of words, as they can appear in stories and some videogames (You know, like English games using the words, 'Thee', 'Thou', etc. They're rare because of their age, but they can still find a use in medieval style games!). In fact, I might prefer it that way as I want to learn as much words as possible and converting English to katakana is easy when you learn about how Japanese pronunciation works. Just add a note to say it's rare to avoid confusion.-Some objects are... Odd. I saw this red box and the definition said it was a piggy bank or something, I was confused until I saw a dial, which meant it was a safe. Maybe you should make objects cliched/stereotyped and exaggerated to help people understand with a quick glance.-It doesn't follow spaced repitition, so you can mash the replay button endlessly until you get yourself a star. If you're a serious learner, never press the replay button, as you just bring it back to your short term memory and fail to remember it the next few days, at least space the replays by an hour the *first* time you try it.-Lists make it too easy sometimes, avoid using them and just use the random button, as I found myself just clicking whatever's next to the last object I clicked on, as I was able to remember the next thing I added right after. This is a mnemonic that relies on the location of the object INGAME, so it doesn't really help you learn. If you really want to do lists, run around the whole house clicking random items and adding them to the list, avoiding any sort of order or pattern.And here's some tips for Japanese:-Avoid Romaji, in fact, do kanji, when you don't know a word, you don't know it, there's no improving your ability to decipher meaning from kanji, so just dive right into it. Do kana if you're really keen on learning pronunciation before reading, and want to do it really, really quickly. Same thing probably applies with Pinyin and Hanzi, but I haven't played  the Chinese version so I don't know if Pinyin is provided.-The dots that appear between kana when you look at how to read the kanji is important, memorise the kana in sections divided by the dots, and their associated kanji (e.g. (毎日 [まい＊にち] まい is 毎 and にち is 日)) This is important, words might have multiple readings, and you might get them wrong, but if you memorise at least ONE reading for the kanji, you can type it on a computer, and even get the correct reading by typing the kanji on a dictionary.-While katakana is easy when you know it well enough, sometimes it isn't, as you might say different versions of a word (E.g. Fairy Floss vs. Cotton Candy, (Well, it's neither when translated to Japanese, but you get my point!)) or it's just katakana but isn't based on English, (e.g. パン for bread). Either way, it's nice to learn a ton of katakana in this game as you get badges for it.Other than that, it's good as you'll find objects in an every day home, and the exploration stops you from being bored quickly, and most importantly:It makes you think of (and therefore associate the word you're learning with) objects and pictures, rather than the English translation, which means that you can achieve fluency which allows you to form sentences in the language you want in your head directly, rather than creating an English sentence, translating it to your wanted language, THEN saying, writing or expressing it.

Posted: November 4, 2016
												Purchased Japanese version on sale, played for about 5 minutes and then realized 90% of the words are simply loan words written in Katakana. It's as if the creator of this version used Google translate for every object that appears in the game. Actually, I'm almost convinced this is what was done, because the first result of any English -> Japanese translation on Google is almost always a Katakana rewrite of the English word. (Eg: ""Door"" is written as ""ドア"" which is literally pronounced ""DO-A"")Instead of using actual Japanese vocabulary, the word for ""door"" ( ""戸"" usually pronounced ""TO"") in this game is simply the example I used above. Another example is ""lamp"": usually a form of ""電灯"" (pronounced ""DEN-TO""), but in this game it is simply ""ランプ"" (RAN-PU). I could go on, but I would be listing almost all of the vocabulary included.Put simply, this particular language version reeks of laziness. There is no Kana or Kanji instruction included within the game, so if you cannot read Katakana or Hirigana, you are forced to read Romaji and tediously assign syllables to the characters (a ♥♥♥♥ing awful and inefficient way of learning new alphabet(s)). Fortunately I can read both, so I decided to work on my Kanji, but as previously mentioned, 90% of the words are English words written in Katakana. Thus there is not much Kanji, let alone Japanese in the game.This game expects you to understand 2 entire alphabets before playing, yet makes no effort to teach actual vocabulary from the corresponding language. I don't know what anyone is supposed to learn from this.Tl;DR The game itself is a great idea, but if you're advertising a language-learning tool that provides next to no *actual* vocabulary from the language itself, you made a huge mistake. Maybe other versions are better, I don't know.Edit: People keep mentioning that ""door"" is ""doa"". Yeah, *western style* doors, not every door in the world, let alone Japan. It was one example out of many. I'm aware the Japanese use many loan words, but most words in this game are loan words. I was just looking for a little more vocabulary, as most loan words still have a Japanese equivalent (or did before 1853 at least)Yes I'm also a huge weaboo ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for learning another language.			"

*This is a new review for Influent. I deleted a previous one.Originally posted by shun:Though I'm going to ""rate it up"" for the game, there won't be much more pros for you to buy it.Truth be told, Influent is quite creative to learn vocabulary for any starter in any language. While it does limit. You're enclosed to a room with many stuffs to interact with but strangely just to memorize up to 420 words including adjectives. What's worse is there's no chance to learn something grammatical. Hence, it's for fun, for joy and relatively less educative. I have about 1,100 Spanish words born in mind in one week with Duolingo. that's what you might go to, if you're hitting the road in learning a language. "

												It's OK to get a little bit into a language but it is not very clever in the way it teaches you words. - It will only teach you either the singular or the plural form, which means you have to look up the words anyway.- The nice lady will only tell you the word to click on, but not its gender, which is kind of a shame in a language that has grammatical emphasis on gender.- Verbs also just come in the infinitive form which again, depending on the language you want to learn, isn't exactly useful.- A lot of the words are either so basic that you don't actually need specific software to pick them up.- The interface is a bit clunky and it can be kind of frustrating to rearrange the lists. Also, if you misclick you have to do a time attack with the whole list that you put the word in again and again to “master” it, which can cause mild annoyance.AFAIK there are only new language packs planned but not actual expansions that add some more words/areas			"

												Very Fun and Interactive Game. Time Attack is a nice way to challenge yourself and remember the words. That being said, there is still much room for improvement. For example, a much more simple and clear vocabulary list with a category system. Also this game is lacking the important fundamentals needed in order to understand or construct sentences. At its current state it's a simple game where you learn object names in different languages. I think any translation sites will suffice. However, If you can put all that aside because this game teaches you in a more entertaining way, Go ahead and get the game. Also note that there are only 420 words so far. At the current state of the game and the price. I do not recommend it.			"

												So I was robbing this dude's apartment and ended up learning a new language.  Seriously, though, this is a fun way to learn all those boring but essential words like bed, shelf, couch, etc. The game keeps you motivated with the To-Do List and the unlockables, as well as the Steam achievements.   Does it go beyond basic words? Yes! For pretty much every noun, you eventually unlock an adjective, adverb, verb, etc. that goes along with it, giving you context to use your new words in! Now you know how to call your television stupid or a book interesting. (Sentences are not given, though, just to clarify that.) More than one adjective is given to plenty of nouns, so there are more words to learn that you think at first. There's also fun with the treasure hunt element to it as far as some of the words/items go, like finding slippers under the bed.   While I would happily recommend this to a complete beginner, I've been learning Russian for about eight months and I still found this game to be incredibly useful. Each way of testing yourself comes with simple and useful options. Don't know the Cyrillic alphabet yet? You can choose for the Russian words to be in Latin characters/Romanized. (I am guessing this would ring true for other language options.) You can choose to be tested on the words with or without audio, with or without sound, and with or without your native language translation. (Having all enabled is the default, of course.)   Also, the voice is a pleasant female one, if that matters to you.   The option to test your vocabulary words being given only the audio and not the text has helped me a lot, so I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their listening/recognition skills.   It also helps that for each test, there are repeat items in each room, so when you're doing kitchen vocabulary, you can click on the book in the kitchen without having to go into another room, and you don't need to walk over to the bathroom just so you can click on soap, since both also exist in the kitchen. So there is a lot of unnecessary moving around avoided.   I had to reconfigure the trackpad on my MacBook to be able to enable the right-click options (which are important, since they open doors, shelves and whatnot) but it was quite simple. The game also is very clever and you can click on things very easily, even if you're at a weird angle. You don't need to be close to click on things, which is nice when you want to click on the magnet in the other room.   Like other people said it's not something you'd use to learn the entire language. It doesn't go into grammar. But if there was a language-learning food pyramid, this could definitely be your хлеб.

												Influent is an educational game meant to help memorize a basic vocabulary in an entertaining fashion. You go through 3 rooms in a hip modern apartment, click on objects to learn their names (with a vocalization / spelling / a synonym or two and a translation to your language of choice. For some reason the translation is actually turned off by default) and pass short semi-optional ""locate this object"" tests for every 10 words you memorize (memorization is not automatic). You get to learn slightly over 400 words, and that's the first issue - that's not nearly enough for the most basic vocabulary (and the words included in the game aren't necessarily sorted by ""most useful / common"", either). You basic phrasebook will contain thousands of words, as that's the bare necessity to start communicating in an effective manner.Furthermore;  the lexicon itself is highly suspect. As my mother is a Russian speaker (trying to expand her English vocabulary), I'm using the Russian UI. Of course the game resets to English every time it restarts, and not only are the instructions full of literal and cumbersome translations from English (as well as quite a few technical terms that actually have Russian equivalents but are merely transliterated instead of being translated) - but the quality of translation is quite shoddy. For instance, the ""pot"" part of a ""potted plant"" is translated as a ""cooking pot"". That sort of carelessness is presumably just as present when the game teaches you actual words in languages other than English.The controls are immensely frustrating. My mom, not used to WASD, basically gave up on the game due to being unable to navigate effectively. Then, I, experienced gamer that I am, found myself baffled as well. You have to hold the left or right mouse key to rotate the camera view, then navigate with WASD to move your character around, and once you've stopped, your view is basically fixed and you have to click on objects in order to name / memorize them. It's really frustratingly sluggish and unresponsive. Trying to click on items that are on shelves / next to another item is just a huge chore.So far, we're probably mostly dealing with budget constraints. This last part however, is an intentional design feature I genuinely would not believe if I hadn't experienced it for myself: you have to grind. You have to grind words in this educational game in order to unlock all the available words. You see, as the game starts, you can only memorize proper nouns - adverbs and adjectives are ""locked away"" until you progress further. So... do you have to memorize a certain number of words to unlock them? Do you have to pass a certain number of item locating tests? No and not quite. You have to ""perfectly memorize"" a word by locating it several times during several tests. Once you do so, you get a star or two, which you can use to unlock adverbs and adjectives. There are hundreds of them, so if you want to get the full (pitiful) 450 word vocabulary, you're going to be grinding out item locations in the same little virtual corner for quite a while. Possibly the most daft implementation of an idea that was unnecessary to begin with I've ever encountered.			"

												Influent is a great idea. It's nice to be able to point at anything and find out the word. As others have mentioned, this game is not going to teach you to speak a foreign language, it's just a way to learn some vocabulary. It's unlikely in my opinion that anyone would be content with learning a few nouns and have no understanding of how the language works so you definitely won't learn to speak a new language from scratch with this software.I had this in mind when I chose the language to install. Since I speak Spanish pretty fluently I knew there wouldn't be much point there. Instead I chose to install the French version as I have a basic understanding of French. Now, I loved the point at anything and learn how to say it concept, the problem for me is that the things you can point at are household objects that, if you are learning a language, you are likely to have learnt elsewhere. I found the environment to be really claustrophobic, it's a small flat with only a lounge, a kitchen, a bathroom (which I initially missed as the door's shut) and a bedroom.I was disappointed that you can't go outside. You can't even see out of the windows. There could have been all kinds of interesting vocabulary to learn if you could. Different environments would really help here. The key would be to expose the player to environments with vocabulary unlikely to be covered in textbooks or other forms of study. It would also make it more exciting. What if the game took place on an aircraft, or in a castle? That may sound strange but how many people learn to say lifejacket or moat when studying a language? I'm not saying it isn't practical to start in a house as that is more useful, I'm just saying if someone is really trying, chances are they will have learnt those words elsewhere. This could be a great way to learn less familiar vocab with new environments as DLC. They wouldn't even need to be big, think of the possibilities involved in naming all of the parts of a car, for example. There also need to be more minigames to memorize new words, in my opinion. The my Spanish coach DS game had good ideas here that the developer could ape perhaps. Bottom line, great idea with good potential but not quite there yet.			"

												Influent is sold as a “Language Learning Game” focusing on vocabulary and and pronunciation. I was the lucky winner of the Japanese pack and I’ve played around with it for quite a while, so let’s explore it a little, shall we?I already had (a very low) background in learning Japanese when I got this game, so my experiences may vary from someone who has never touched the language before. Believe it or not, Influent has a sort of ‘story’ behind it. It’s not overly… special, but a story is something you don’t necessarily expect in something like a Language Learning software - game or not. In Influent you take the role of Andrew Cross. He’s spent three years developing a device that would allow people to interact with their surroundings by providing them the item’s names in different languages. However, this device is stolen and sold under the thieves’ branding, and so Andrew’s response to this was to improve on the device and launch a campaign, swearing to learn 300 words in a foreign language to prove how evil those thieves are.Just how precisely that works, I have no idea. The story makes no sense, hence it gets a low rating, however, the fact that they even thought as far as to give it a bit of a backstory besides “randomly get words in another language” deserves cookie points in my book.The graphics aren’t out of this world, but I think they’re sufficiently good in their cartoonish way, and fit the quirky story of the game. I actually really like the art and the style of it. It’s simple, it does the job, and, more importantly, it makes it more approachable as you don’t need a super computer to run it. That said, I don’t feel this is neither a language learning software, nor all it could be. Don’t get me wrong, I do love this game, but it lacks something. Before I get into that, though, let’s get on with the more technical aspects:You can play this in first or third person. All of the game (so far) happens inside Andrew’s apartment, so it’s a tad limited in that sense, however, there is good depth of detail on the words you can learn; for instance, you can point at the door to get that word in Japanese, but if you point at the door frame, you will actually get “door frame” and not just “door”. You can open things (drawers, closets and cabinets, fridge, etc) and look at the things inside. Basically, you move around the house and press a button to have the name of the item you’re looking (pointing with the mouse) at appear in the target language. The user interface is already available in various languages, and there are several target language DLCs you can choose from, in my case, since it was Japanese, you got all the necessary information: romaji, kana and kanji (along with pronunciation). You can select which of all this to see, you can see alternate words for the item, you can choose to add it to lists, and as you progress through your lists achievements you will be able to unlock more things: you start with simple words for objects, then you move on to adjectives and the like.You have various lists, all of 10 items, which you can then test yourself on. When you play this mini-game, you will be given or told a word, and you will have to find the item and press a button again to mark it. Depending on how fast you are, you might even earn stars. Complete enough lists or achieve a certain speed and you will start ticking off achievements in the game. It also has small goals with their corresponding achievements.Now, here we reach part 1 of what bothers me: This isn’t really so much a Language Learning game as just a tool to aid in Language Learning. There is a difference, as with a language learning programs you can expect to get some basic structure so that you can start speaking with, at the very least, short, broken sentences; Influent, however, only gives you words. There are no connectors, no real actions (even in you have some verbs), and no further information on how to put a sentence together. That’s fine, but it’s what makes it only an aid tool. It’s basically just an interactive flashcard system and a great help to expand on your basic and not so basic everyday vocabulary, but it’s not the only tool you’ll need if you actually want to learn the language.It can, however, also be used as a starting point to gain some vocabulary before you go into basic sentences.The second thing that… not so much bothers me, but just disappoints me, is how limited it is. Since everything happens within his house, then that is all you get to learn about. I would really, truly adore to see the game be expanded on (as default, and not as DLCs!) by include the outside world. The idea of being able to take my character out into the world and see the items at a park, or buildings, or houses, enter a shop and see what they sell… it could be so much more, and it feels like the game doesn’t reach its full potential. I feel like they could even include very basic dialogue with NPCs (for instance, talking to a neighbor and saying “Nice weather” or entering a shop, picking an item, and being able to choose between “how much is this” and “I’ll take 5 of this”). So at the end of the day, it feels rather bland. The game controls aren’t too difficult, but they aren’t overly comfortable either. The replayability is both high and non-existent depending on your level with the target language. it’s high while you’re learning and reinforcing the basics, but once you’re past the basic household items level, you really have nothing else to do with the game other than an occasional revision. All in all, Influent is a very nice tool to help with your language learning, and I would highly recommend it as that, but I don’t think I would recommend it if you’ve never touched the language before OR are way past beginner level.

												This game has a good concept, but it falls short because it's shallow. There's no storyline or reason for doing anything. It's basically an immersive 3D flashcard game. This game DOES NOT focus on grammar or sentence construction. Only vocabulary, and almost all singular nouns. However, I'm okay with vocabulary being the focus of the game. The issue is the lack of depth in other aspects. If the creator of the game could expand this game to include a storyline, interactive characters, some puzzles, etc., it could be great. It would also be nice to get out of the guy's apartment. It's basically his bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and living room with a small closet. It would be nice to get outdoors in the game, go to the restaurant, the doctor, the grocery store, work, a school, etc.I got the Spanish version. I wish there was an option to get Latin American Spanish though. If they can get it made, I'll buy it, even though I already own the European Spanish.As of right now, it's shallow, but I do think this game does have potential.			"

												Not a bad little program for adding some basic vocabulary. I have the Spanish version, which unfortunately only caters to European Spanish, complete with the infamous lisp. Though the little quiz feature encourages you remember the vocabulary, this game could do with some more interesting, practical excercises, what we language teachers call ""Drilling"". Overal not bad and not expensive, but don't expect this game to make you fluent; you will only learn and handful basic nouns and I'm assuming that all of the language packs are the same.			"

												This 'game' is just one of many other tools to help someone learn a language.  You will not be able to have a converstation after playing this - but it can help you build vocabulary of items you see every day.  I presume that is its simple intent.  Regarding Italian, it does include articales for the items - thats good news.I had emailed the developers before purchase - prompt, complete, and helpful reply.Glad I bought it - works fine in Linux.

												I absolutely love this game.Let me start by saying that I picked this up for the German version.  I've been learning German with Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, and German television shows for a few months, but wanted something that I could sit down and play when I want to change up my learning style.This game should not be purchased if you want to learn grammar or phrases.  In the German version you learn mostly vocabulary words (I say mostly because I still haven't found every word, and who knows... maybe there's something else out there).Now, one of the most important things for learning words in a foreign language is having a memory to place with the word.  A game like this provides this SIGNIFICANTLY better than a memory based card game.  Why?  Because you're remembering a word based on not only its graphic visualisation, but you're remembering it within the context of the home.  In this game, if you have to find the ""pfeffer"", you not only have to remember the word for pepper, but WHERE the pepper is.  It's helped me remember words extremely easily.Don't buy this as your primary way to learn a language.  Buy it as a way to help you build vocabulary alongside a few other language learning classes or programs.  That's what I bought it for, and that's what it does best.If duolingo ever releases bulgarian, I'll definitely be picking up another version of this game.  I highly recommend it.			"

												This game is pretty fun, it's really good if you're needing to develop a vocabulary, as you get to choose what words you want to add to a list and then you can do a time time attack where you need to find all the words as quickly as possible. The fact that they have so many languages to get from the beginning is also a nice feature. The controls are a bit clunky like needing to click multiple times to have the game recognize it. Other than that, it works pretty good overall and I definitely recommend to someone who needs to build a vocabulary like me.			"

												I wish I could post a review with ""maybe"". But since I have to choose, I'll choose ""no'. I got so excited to see a sleek-looking language game on sale that I proceeded to purchase it without looking more closely at the reviews. Being somewhat of a language nerd, I must say I was disappointed.First of all, the title, with its cute and clever pun, is pretty much misleading. This is just a (limited) vocabulary game. Nothing ""fluent"" about learning a language here. This game's approach to learning a foreign language comes down to pointing at objects and listening to how they are called. Then you can play some games, such as looking for specific objects around the apartment as fast as you can. It seems like most of the effort was put into the graphics and other aspects of the gameplay. There is no method or theory behind the language learning. Did they do the game in collaboration with a specialist? I highly doubt so. I know this game was Kickstarted, but it's wrong to make a language game if you're only a game developer and then hint at ""fluency"" when you try to come up with the title. Learning a language is a process which requires the application of various methods, some of which the developers should have explored, in my opinion. For all I care, the game could be 2D and less shiny and pretty, but with more meaningful and diverse activities.Yes, this game has its good sides, it looks pretty and it teaches you words in a logical context. It can help you expand your vocabulary a little. But that's it. The language lover in me will want to finish it and master all the vocabulary, but I expected more.  "

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Influent. An Interesting Edutainment Idea, But Not Fleshed Out Enough.Genre: 1st/3rd Person Language Teaching Edutainment Game. Developed and Published by: Rob Howland & Three Flip StudiosPlatform: Windows, MacOSX and LinuxBusiness Model: Multiple DLCs that unlock their respective language. Player only needs to buy the languages they want. The rest can be ignored. A Press Key Was Provided Free of Charge Overall Gameplay ThoughtsInfluent is an edutainment title where it’s trying to expand your vocabulary of a particular language. It attempts to accomplish this by giving you 420 words to learn through visual learning, memorization and matching words with the right objects in time attack quizzes. In my case, I mostly focused on the Spanish & English Languages while poking in the other languages to hear what they sounded like. The only story in this game is the opening cutscene with some guy rambling on about his not-Kickstarter project for an object called the SanjigenJiten. A device that can apparently translate the name of any every-day object into the desired language. It’s a cute cutscene but it’s completely unnecessary due to the complete lack of story after it. The general mechanic of the game is that you click on objects to hear the name spoken out loud and displayed on the screen. You then save ten objects to a list which is then used for a time-attack quiz. The time attack quiz has you matching the spoken/displayed word to the correct object as quickly as you can. Do it correctly three times and you’ll have “mastered” the word according to Influent. There’s also a “fly-by” mode where you do the same name-to-object matching except you fly around in a small toy plane that can shoot lasers. This is my big problem point with Influent. For a visual learner like myself, a game like Influent would be a godsend if I were to learn a new language. Having the ability to see an item, put a word to it in a foreign language and practice that multiple times sounds like a good idea. But even as I sit here, I’m having trouble remembering any of the words I so-called “mastered” in Influent. There’s a lot of visual showing but there’s not a lot of educational mechanics to make it stick. I think even going so far as to add descriptions to items or using them in a sentence would have be a good idea. But the game just doesn’t really explore educating through experience or through interaction with the objects. There isn’t even other types of quizzes or mini-games to break up the experience either. It’s monotonous and I really don’t think it should be. The fly-by mode only exacerbates the other problem this game has: it’s too crowded in this small apartment. Flying around should be fun but it’s far too easy to run into the wall while you’re trying to shoot at the “target”. It also points out just how small this world is that you can look around. You can’t go or even see outside. I think that’s where they should have focused on, if they didn’t want to come up with new teaching mechanics, is expanding the world so you can walk around more. Instead, you’re restricted to a small apartment with a bedroom, living room, bathroom and kitchen. It’s a bit disappointing. Looking at the Business Model and Voice QualityInfluent’s business model is a bit weird but it breaks down to you buying the language version that you primarily want for $10 and $5 for every subsequent language. I don’t disagree with it because I don’t see a lot of people learning more than a few languages. If you can/are willing to, I think you’ll be able to pay for it. That being said, I’m not convinced that the value is there. A lot of the different voice actors sound like they’re speaking through very cheap mics, rushing their lines and/or don’t sound very uninterested in what they’re doing. I get it. Saying ~400 words just by themselves without any sentences to go along with them isn’t the most exciting prospect for a voice actor/actress. But hearing them drone on in the same monotone voice gets old after 20-30mins. It doesn’t help that the voice volume isn’t always consistent and sometimes that volume will peak. PC SettingsThis game is lacking a lot of settings for a PC-based title. Your only options are resolution choices, windowed/fullscreen, anti-aliasing up to 8X and V-sync on/off. For some strange reason, Influent allows the framerate to go up to 300FPS and “maximum”. Not entirely sure what the benefit of that setting is (because the most that monitors can show is 144FPS) but it's there. The game’s engine also seems to detect your aspect ratio and display only the resolution options relevant to that ratio. In my case, I couldn’t see any 16:9 resolutions (I run 1680x1050p) but I checked with someone else and they were able to run the game in 16:9 options as well as 4:3. It’s odd. What you’ll notice missing as far as visuals go are shadows, texture quality and other detail sliders. You probably won’t miss them as this game isn’t that great of a looker (and I don’t think the game uses shadows much) but it’s absence is significant. One thing I have to point out: music sliders and a mute button for the music/sound effects are missing from the options menu. Look, the music is good. I enjoy Lifeformed’s work and it fits pretty well in Influent. But considering you’re only using a few of his tracks and they repeat quite a bit, I’d like to have the ability to play something else in the background. Additionally, the UI is a mess, often being unintuitive. With elements hidden off the screen and being uncertain about what we’re supposed to be doing. The tip guide helps to a degree but it feels like some more attention should have been put here. . Final ThoughtsInfluent was designed to give the player an expanded vocabulary in the particular language they’re learning. It does accomplish that….to a small degree. Regardless of what language you pick, you’ll be able to pick up words for objects from this game. However, there isn’t much to this game outside of pointing at objects, having their name read to you and then having to try to memorize that name. It’s a lot of information dumping without context or reason to learn these words. Well, outside of the fact that you’re stuck in this place and you’ve got nothing better to do. For a visual learner like myself, it’s a neat idea. Really, it’s too bad that you’re stuck in such a small place. A much more open game would have been far more interesting to explore and learn the language. Admittedly, that would have also been more expensive to make. Without a larger world, well, then I have to look at what we have and what we have here isn’t enough for me to recommend Influent. All it is, is looking around a very tiny apartment at static objects. Where all I can do is open doors and participate in two slight variations of a time-attack quiz. That isn’t enough. I definitely feel there should have been more ideas implemented. Different ways to quiz players on what they learned to make sure that the words stick in their head. Expecting a word to be “mastered” simply because I pointed my mouse cursor at it three times isn’t enough. Influent is a neat idea, but there needs to be something more underneath it than pretty graphics and a fairly one-dimensional test.

												I am a language teacher and was given a free copy by the developers to review.It is great as a platform for vocabulary acquisition but you are not going to learn a new language just by exploring somebody's apartment! I would prefer it if the developers focused on expanding the game world rather than adding more and more languages...I will give this a thumbs up as it helped me learn quite a few French words in a short space of time. I learnt no grammar and very little I could use when speaking to people. As I said great as a 'vocabulary learning game' but not really the 'language learning game' the developers promote it as.			"

												This is a vocabulary learning tool only, so just from this game alone you definitely won't master a language. All it does is give you 420 basic words of things found in an apartment. If you learn best through visualization, this game is for you. You will still need to use other tools alongside it, for example Duolingo or Quizlet, and you'll need to learn grammar rules from somewhere else. But to start with, it's a really useful tool.Also for the people who leave negative reviews bc they expected more than just vocab - don't blame the game for you not reading the description. Nowhere does it say anything about grammar, it clearly states it's about vocab and pronunciation.If you want to learn a language but need to build up some basic vocabulary first, I recommend you get this.

												Pay no heed to most negative reviews. The software gives exactly what it proposed:BASIC VOCABULARY and PRONUNCIATION.As such, it doesn't teach verbs and grammar, so it is a HELPER program for someone already studying a language and for children.I am a teacher, and I can already say this program would be pretty nice for children's earlier years... Definitely better than children books of basic vocabulary due to its interactivity, and also cheaper than most similar books.

												Last ReviewI finally got the game to work. Not even sure how. I installed and unistalled drivers, updated BIOS, ran as Admin, compatibility mode, with overlay, without overlay, downloaded dlls, deleted local files, installed again, checked cache integrity etc. Nothing worked. Then, it just did. But that is the Computer world sometimes.Anyway, after being put to too much stress for a pretty simplistic (yet awesome concept) I can only NOT recommend this game. Reasons:1) I cannot recommend this to an average PC user if its going to have the time I had with it. Really bad time. For all of you that had no issues, well, that is why you should write your review and I do mine. You cannot justify my horrible experience with yours. It is just stupid. 2) It is not a finished game if it has that many bugs (in my opinion). Not very good quality control3) Based on other reviews, the language I chose to learn (german) have many vocabulary problems. I wouldn't know that, I don't speak german. I did try the English version on my girlfriend PC and it was very good. If average people are finding problems with the pronuntiation and vocabulary, then maybe they should give their quality control team a bigger push.4) Really good concept but is too limited. Maybe it has the potencial, but as right now... No.It is not a waste of money at all. It is a good Tool for learning, but for my experience, I can't recommend. 1st ReviewStuck on:0 save files foundLoading DeutschBlack screen for about 1 hour and a half...2nd ReviewNO, I did not let the black screen run for 1 hr. I tried making it work for that long. I am♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Never had a problem with a game like this. It should be pretty straight forward, but it is not. NOT WORKING, as of right now. When it does, I will try it again and give a better review of the actual game, but right now: its a NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NOOOOOO			"

												I like the concept, the idea, the point of it. It is just done in a way that makes me want to sit in school to learn rather than play this.If there would be puzzles or reasons for me to look at items, that would turn the game into a game, i would not be borred after the 10 first words.Also the controlls are unatural to me.Hope some update will come around to improve it from ""looking at yellow stickers to an object"", to an intresting way learning a language.

												It IS handy for learning common vocabulary but you won't be learning a language by only using this. I would personally suggest using this for gaining a broader supply of words but using the free website Duolingo at https://www.duolingo.com/ for actually learning the technical parts, like forming sentences and such stuff. Using both of these is a good way to start learning languages.			"

												Great game!It doesnt really help you to learn a language, but to build a vocabulary. If you're studying grammar, then Influent is great for you to learn new words. Nouns, verbs and adjectives.Most of negative recommendations here is probably due people who wants to play an ordinary game and have some fun. Influent is not about that. It's about learning words in a new language, and if you study that language, then it's gonna be lots of fun for you.I just hope they add more scenarios to explore, not only that appartment.			"

												Well-made, but not quite to the point where I don't regret spending 10 dollars. As said in other reviews, this is basically an interactive flashcard program. Everything is very high-quality, but it needs more substance. Had I checked the reviews, I would gladly have paid $5 for this someday. It's very well-made, and a lot of work must have gone towards acquiring the very good audio samples (I tried it in Russian). The developer has replied to some of the more popular (and angsty) reviews, but I hope he/she can respond to the more constructive ones as well. One assumes when looking at a ""language game"" that it will help build their language skills, rather than just vocabulary. I don't think there's very much demand for that, however.I sincerely hope they can rework this game to be more about building functionality for players, allowing them gain at least a basic sense of sentence structure and grammar so that they can put these words to use. I had hoped to find something more along the lines of a gameified Rosetta Stone. As a former ESL teacher, I had hoped that someone did what I would like to do some day--find a way to teach foreign languages in a gaming setting. These guys have taken a great first step, but all I can do is find myself hoping for something more.I realize that restructuring this game to be a more comprehensive language tool would mean a *LOT* of work. For a game that did what most negative reviewers (and I) hoped, I would happily pay more like $20-$30. Currently toying with the idea of asking for a refund, but I may let them keep my $10 unhindered in the hope that the game will see radical updates someday.			"

												Influent is quite basic in nature with the simple objective of walking around a small 4 room apartment clicking on objects to learn their pronounciation in any given target language. Although it hosts this extremely simplistic goal it really does a sucessful job at drawing the players attention in and making them want to learn. It is notable that Influent isn't going to form you into some language speaking master capable of conversing in any language but it does provide a solid baseline in which you can form your grammatical understanding on top of. If anything, just for the purpose of learning 400+ words this game is a invaluable source for language learners in a somewhat beggining state.			"

												Influent is a fantastic language learning aid. Will you be fluent after playing it alone? No, but a language isn't learned in its entirety from one source. While you may want more in grammar or conjugation, it will allow you to widen the range of your vocabulary greatly. It's an aid, and in the form of a video game. Learning a language doesn't get much more entertaining than flying a Star Fox homage around an apartment, firing lasers at objects to identify them.To my fellow French learners, bonne chance.To the gamers, pew pew pew.

Influent will not teach you grammar or conversation but if you are learning those elsewhere then this game greatly improves those skills as you go.

""Learn unknown languages with ordinary items in your flat""You are in your virtual 3D flat (the graphics are minimal ok) and keep on clicking on objects to learn their name in your favourited new language. Each word will be added to your vocabulatory list and after 10 new words you can run some different tests on your knowledge (just voiced, hinted, non hinted).The challenge is to find evertime new items in your small flat. Some items are parent items which have children items. Like bed to pillow, matrasse, blanket and bedframe. If you can master some nouns (do 3 tests in a row without mistakes) you can also open linked adjectives and verbs. 420 words can be found at least.Nervewracking is just that the soundtrack restarts in every exploring phase and fanblades are rapidly moving to catch them as a word.

												(For the Russian version) For learning the names of the items around you daily, this program is great. As for actually learning conversational Russian... not so much. Also it doesn't break down letters or syllabuls to ensure proper reading (I can only imagine how difficult this would be if you were trying to learn a far eastern language).Another thing I noticed is they use selective words over general words in some cases. For example: Шляпа (Shlyapa) does mean 'hat' but it refers to a certain kind of hat like a fedora - the general term for 'hat' is actually Шапка (Shapka). I saw this again with the shirts. Each shirt in this game was Рубашка (Roobashka) which is more of a dress shirt or collared shirt - you would use Футболка (Footbolka) for T-shirt.I could see this game having a LOT of potential if it were to go in the right direction.

That's all you can do, then review it or play a time attack where you have to click objects. And t's not like you're going to click 100 objects and learn that in a day, not even 50. The game gets boring after playing for about 5-10 minutes because of this, and because you are in a very small place.I thought it had some other sort of gameplay that included language learning, not just clicking on some objects. There are many other apps or tools you can buy for this money or that are free which are better for learning.			"

												Early review, will complete once I finish the learning.Using Japanese to English.On the positive side:-Interactive-Complete audio-Word swap for items with more than one usual word-Diverse (roughly 70% nouns,15 and 15 adjectives/verbs.On the negative side:-Word lock on certain items, for example the adjective ""interesting"" is locked to books, there should be a option when you recognize the word to type in the translation.-Time attack is limited to 10 words list (so far), and very often the same words that are already mastered reoccurs, you have to force the lists yourself to master your latest words, you should be able to either select the length of the time attack word list or force selection of unmastered/leech list.-420 words, which is not much, and half of those surely aren't in the JLPT5 list (what you're looking at when beginning japanese), and one can admit that the game is expensive when flashcards are available for free on android or other OS.All in all, it's a good tool to memorize words, which you will always need in a language, but considering that, it should be more extensive, more words and an option for longer runs/typing in.

												I'll preface with: I think the idea of this game is golden. I would love to play a game and learn a new language while having some level of fun and immersion.This isn't that, but it's a good start.The game has a good bit of vocabulary for around the house, so it's fine if you already understand how to structure a sentence in your chosen language. But it certainly doesn't get you to conversational level and for someone brand-new to their language, it's just... not good. But if you know how to conjugate a verb and what articles to use for which nouns, then it's a pretty o.k. tool for an incredibly limited amount of words. It isn't really worth the price right now- You can pick up a children's book from the native country for cheaper and probably get about the same experience.tl;dr: love the medium. hopeful of more places to go in the future, until then, overpriced and underwhelming.

												--THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE GERMAN VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE-- RECOMMENDED...but with some notable caveats.VOCAB GENDER: I was hesitant to purchase this program at first because I wasn't sure if it would identify the gender of the vocabulary words. Gender is VERY important to speak proper German as it modifies many other words in a sentence (mein, meine, meinen...etc.) While the game DOES give the gender via text when selecting the word, it does not speak the gender in the audio or when doing the games. I would much prefer if it included that, since the games are meant to bolster your vocabulary it should include gender in spoken audio. ONLY TEACHES VOCAB: If you want a program focused on creating sentences and communicating with others, try Rosetta Stone. This is first and foremost vocab software. Go elsewhere to learn how to employ verbs correctly.GOOD VOCAB, BUT MISSING ELEMENTS: The list of vocabulary words consists of ""around the house"" items. While useful, it does not cover things like ordering in a restaurant, traveling, etc.A GOOD COMPONENT TO LANGUAGE LEARNING, BUT NOT A COMPLETE PROGRAM: This software is excellent and fun for learning basic vocabulary, but limited in many ways. My dream language program is similar to this in 3D/FPS style, but including many places like restaurants, train stations, work, and with NPCs whom you can interact with and ""discuss"" topics, such as your boss, a waitperson, a buddy at the bar (""Kneiper""), a date, a hotel staffer...sort of a Rosetta Stone meets Second Life. Literally a 3D immersion in the other culture. This is not it.The final word,KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO: This is a vocab program. Basic, but good, and fun to boot. But at the moment it can only be a component to a more comprehensive language program, not the foundation. (For those that know/care, I would gauge this as a level A1 program under the Common European Framework.)			"

												I am currently taking classes to learn Russian (in my second semester), and this game is VERY helpful with vocabulary. What people need to understand is that there is no magic, effortless, lazy-oriented utility to help you learn all of a language. Language is very complicated and if you want to thoroughly learn one you need to put in a lot of effort to memorize and pound grammar (that is sometimes completely illogical at that) into your head. I really don't understand the notion from people that this game isn't worth it just because it only teaches vocabulary. Do they know that is the hardest part of a language? Vocabulary is endless hours of memorization and usage. With that being said, I will say that if you are actually trying to learn the language and not just doing this for fun or because you like memorization games (kinda like me, mainly why I'm learning a new language) this game is best used in conjunction with some self study of the grammar or a class to learn the grammar and boulster your confidence in the language. This game will SIGNIFICANTLY improve your usage of the language because vocabulary is key to being able to express yourself. Grammar is important, but if you use the wrong conjugation or maybe even tense because you are not quite fine tuned with the grammar most native speakers will still be able to understand you.All in all, I think this game is one of my favorite. There is so many languages you can learn. If you like memorization as much as I do (ALOT), like learning languages, and enjoy simple games, this is the game for you. I think this game is one of the best I have ever played. I just bought it last night and already finished Russian, gonna practice some more and then move to German or Chinese.			"

In any case, this is a great supplement to a language course; if you are learning the grammar somewhere else, this game can help you revise and learn the vocab. It's a great tool.			"

												I find that fact that I'm playing at 310fps on 4k with 8xAA quite amusing.Mandarin Chinese, Korean, and German reviews;Mandarin - good tool.  It gives you pinyin, 簡體 (简体 - simplified)，and 繁體 (traditional) readings.  The speaker is NOT from Beijing (for once, a learning tool for Westerners without the Beijing dialect!).  He has some sort of dialect but I can't pinpoint where.  It pretty much does as advertised -- gives you words in 3 different writing systems and has a (male) native speaker say the words.  It doesn't give measure words, which I think is sorely, sorely, sorely needed, even if they aren't voiced (like German).  Definitely worth the $5 (DLC Price).Korean -Again a good tool.  You have a choice between Romaja and Hangeul.  But WAY too many loan words.  Overall, though, a great tool.  Especially with a language like Korean, where pronunciation is very difficult for an English speaker.  As a non-tonal language, it truly is just difficult pronunciation, and not tones (like Chinese) that gets us.  Plus, it's great practice with the alphabet seeing the writing and being able to look at the Romaja and listen to a speaker.  Female-voiced. Worth the $5 (DLC Price).German -Okay tool.  Very few loan words.  Some are blatantly just.... wrong... It does give item genders, but does not voice them.  They seriously need to be voiced.  It's actually rather annoying.  With German being so close to English,   Only worth it on sale for $2.49 or so (DLC Price).I bought all of these on sale, to include the base game.  $5 base, $2.49 Korean and $2.49 German.

												Influent is essentially a 3D vocabulary list, and that's the biggest problem with it. Learning a list of words doesn't come naturally and doesn't help establish any connections to other words in the target language. I recurrently ""learn"" a word in Influent only to be unable to recall it seconds later. I've had much more success with Duolingo or the Pimsleur CDs for acquiring new words. The game is a clever idea and I really like the concept, but it needs lessons or missions that use complete sentences and context to help with vocabulary acquisition. As-is it could be useful refresher when you are already nearly fluent. "

												I can't recommend this game enough for people who have a genuine interest in learning a foreign language.  It is a very helpful vocabulary builder.  Do not expect this game, or ANY game, to make you fluent in a foreign language.  However, it is a great resource when combinded with other learning tools.  If you expect anything more than that from a game, frankly, you are delusional.Learning a new language takes a tremendous amount of work.  There is an EXTREMELY unfortunate phenomenon in the review sections of language learning games where ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who have suddenly realized that they are not going to able to watch Naruto in Japanese after playing a game for 5 minutes decide to leave a ragepost about how terrible it is.  If you are interested in learning a new language and willing to put in the effort, definetly get this game.  If you expect to magically become fluent in any language after playing a game for a few minutes, please come back when you aren't ♥♥♥♥ing 11 anymore and reconsider.TL;DR: If you aren't a lazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ Influent is a great little vocabulartly builder.

												I have the French version: A fun way to learn and remember words for some simple, everyday objects. I’m more of a visual learner, so I’ve really enjoyed this. My only complaint is that I wish that they’d given words like colours multiple correct answers, for example, for “yellow” to not only have ""banana"" as an answer, but all other objects that are yellow. It's silly that you need to remember the exact object whenever you want to quiz yourself. I understand that for some other adjectives, like “interesting”, it’s a bit more difficult to relate an object to. This is mainly a great game to learn nouns with, and not so much for adjectives and verbs.			"

												Some people help themselves learn a language by labeling everything in their house in the target language. This is exactly the virtual version of that, no more, no less. I certainly enjoy getting the benefits of that without the real-world eyesore or effort, but it is a very limited tool in learning a language. I would only recommend it as a fun practice tool for those already learning a language in other ways.What it does, it does well. But it doesn't try to do much.Tip: The Spanish language version teaches in a Spanish accent, as opposed to central/southern American which may be more desirable to learn for those in the US.Annoyances: I find the controls a little awkward and I'd like to customize them (say, remap keys), but this isn't an option. No controller support. The UI leaves a bit to be desired. You can only get to some things from the third-person view, for example, and it is really unintuitive to set up language lists. Two days playing it and I can't figure out if there's a way to get a hint when looking for an object. Words are coded with icons and labels whose meaning is not immediately evident. And I wish it would remember my VSync  settings. I'm sure a little more polish can solve these problems, and I hope the developer keeps at it!			"

												This game is basically a point-and-click dictionary. You see an object, you click on it, and the game tells you the translation and pronunciation. It does as described, in that it works on vocabulary acquisition and pronunciation. I'm a bit disappointed, because I was hoping for something immersive that would push you to think instead of memorize. If you're only looking to build your vocab/work on pronunciation, you're golden. Beyond that, I can't say much about this.			"

												Use this alongside a proper language learning course. It is best suited for languages that don't have gendered nouns (e.g. English) and simple pluralization rules (or a lack of plural forms altogether). It's definitely worth its cheap price, even more so if you grab it in a sale. This is also not a game for which you need to own all the DLC to get the full gameplay experience.I think this is a great way to learn words, as you hear the pronunciation, read the spelling, and see the object in question at the same time. This game will only help you learn vocabulary, and this is mostly limited to nouns for objects found in the house. This is not a language course you can use stand-alone, but a learning tool to be used alongside others. I only own the German language pack, and I really wish the voice pronouncing all the words would also include the definite article (words like der/die/das). Plural forms would also be nice, as German has relatively complex rules for pluralizing nouns, which also change depending on the noun's gender.			"

												I usually don't write reviews but this time it's different: this game is awesome!It's is exctly what I needed! Finally someone made it fun to learn foreign languages.If like me you don't have a whole lot of time and a whole lot of patience for learning languages, and if like me learning conjugation and rules before even knowing how to say ""bread"" bores you to death, this ""game"" is for you!It's mainly focusing on vocabulary, but hey, knowing words and nouns is what helps you out in any country even if you can make full sentences. Of course I don't expect this game to actually teach me a whole language but I was looking for an easy introduction and this game does it very well. I purchased Spanish because I live in SoCal and I always wanted to learn it (I took German in school: big mistake), and Japanese because I have family in Japan. Spanish shouldn't be too hard for me because I'm fluent in French, but learning Japanse has always been daunting to me. I tried learning Japanese in the past but frankly, after a day of hard work I'm not so in the mood for more hard work at home.Well, things are different now. I only have to spend 20 minutes a day without getting tired or making my brain hurt. I'm able to remember 20 Japanese words already! Woohoo! (I'm focusing on the kitchen for now)(I recommend when starting an new game in Japanese to choose the Romanji option: it'll display the words in phonetical western alphabet, which helps a lot. Also, during your first sessions start off with a very small set of words, like 10, as it's essential you don't discourage yourself by aiming too high too soon.)Now I'm thinking of purchasing the French DLC for my son who only speaks Japanese and English.OK, I guess you get the picture, I love this ""game"" and I highly recommend it!!

												If you were in elementary school during the 1980's, you might just be old enough to remember floppy disks, Apple DOS, and the frightening noises that those old disk drives used to make when reading. You may also remember the scores of educational video games designed to teach spelling, math, history, and/or hygene; most not particularly fun or memorable.Influent is the bad♥♥♥♥♥nephew of the old educational games that used to put us to sleep in 4th grade. The gameplay is super-straightforward, click your way around a five room apartment and click on objects to hear the names pronounced in a different language than you are used to. After a while of doing this, you'll assemble a vocabulary list, and you can set yourself up to go back through the apartment and match the words with the objects.Something important to understand going in; Influent is not actually a *language* tutor, tt's a vocabulary tutor. It does teach parts of speech, offer synonyms, pronounce words, and if the language in question has multiple alphabets, it can be toggled between them. You'll be able to associate the words with a picture, and since the apartment is pretty well organized (No spare set of sneakers in the fridge,) you'll be able to form easier or harder vocab lists by choosing from different kinds of items. (A very easy one might include only items in the bathroom, while a hard one will have you running all over the apartment.)Influent won't actually teach sentence structure, detail word usage, or explain phrasing. As such, this is probably best used with a language that you speak a little of, but need to improve fluency with. (As opposed one you don't know anything about at all.)It's sort of like video flash cards on horse steroids, and as far as that goes, it accomplishes it pretty damn well.			"

												For a begginer in a second language I have found this game to be helpful in that it is a small stepping stone on my way to learning words.To clarify this, I am learning High German primarily from one fluent speaking friend, a couple of phone apps (which I find underwhelming), and this ... The only thing I could do to improve my rate of learning is take a German course and then immerse myself in the country.But as I say, it is a small stepping stone, I do appreciate that it is devoloped by a single person (last time I checked), and that this person (or persons) has many other languages to update.Where this falls down;*No option to choose gender.*Gendered items of level solely male. (knowing what to call a wallet does not help me when I carry a purse)*Items, such as milk in the refrigerator, whilst when clicked are pronounced ""milch"", still read ""milk"" on the carton, this breaks much of the immersion. -- I feel that when learning a language it is best not to translate object names, simply to hold it up and give it the correct name in that language, otherwise the association between terms will be forever referenced back to the first language and create a mental lag.*Despite a female character being shown on the cover, she never makes an appearance, the player never gets to choose to play as her in her appartment.*No character interaction so as to learn grammar and how to use the words we learn in a sentence.German has around four words for ""the"", they are each gendered, and may be used in a non gendered way to indicate plural items or people, In-Fluent will not teach you this. -- Rather than striving to, it could simply mention what it does not teach so as to make the user aware they will need to pick that up elsewhere.*Character movement is clunky, to move around either mouse button must be clicked and dragged around.*It is not readily apparent to a player (well, at least me), that items once clicked then need to have their corresponding word below clicked so as to catalog them.*Some items are far too small and may wreck the experience of challenge mode, i.e trying to click on keys and clicking the bench they sit on is a constant problem.*This is a game that could benefit from the use of phonetics.This game will teach you many household items, there are at least 200 words to catalog before learning other names for the same item depending on how it may be used in a sentence.For the dedicated player I would say suppliment this with a lot of postit notes around the house of what objects are called in the language you are attempting to learn. -- If you pronounce these as the game has been pronouncing these, you will likely be ever so slightly off with the accent, however walking about the house and saying the name of an item every time you interact with it will help your pronunciation alongside learning.Although a lot of work has been put into this game I would suggest best to pick it up on Steam sale due to its current limitations.

I bought it to help me with Spanish; unfortunately, I don't think the environment presented in the game can help me expand my vocabulary as much or as well as hanging out with native speakers, something easily possible in the United States.It seems mostly oriented (by features and environment,) towards Asian languages.

At 400 words, it's a start, but definitely needs to progress beyond that.My only hope is they soon expand the game to the outside world, such as the supermarket, train station, and other basic locations that would help language learners and travelers alike.

2.0/10.0I was expecting more of this game. I expected something like a challenge, where you get to know what some word means, and then have to translate the words or a sentence into the other language. Or something like that.But the game is quite trivial and useless. The only thing you can do, is walk around in a little apartment, click at some objects, the game will tell you what the thing is called in the chosen language. When you had choose ten words, you can go in to a time race mode, and now you have to find the objects again, which you choose in the first round. Quite boring and trivial IMO.The game is furthermore quite unintuitive, and the controls sucks! When you walk around in third person view, you have to use the mouse to look around.The concept of the game is great. But I was expecting something more innovative, challenging and ""fun"" than this.

 Criticisms	  The game overall is great if you're willing to sit down for a few hours and learn words.  This is an excellent gateway towards beginning to learn a language, but don't delude yourself into thinking that this is enough for you to become fluent in the language you are trying to learn since this ONLY teaches WORDS. You will not learn how to speak the language, or form a sentence in either speech or written form. If you are actually interested in learning the actual language and speak it fluently I recommend you attend a class, or look towards podcasts because all Influent does is teach you words which leads me to my great criticism of this game. You have words, so now what?  The second step in learning languages is sentence formation and the proper pronunciation of the sentence that you create.My last minor criticism is the Alphabet of the language isn't shown anywhere. I have the Japanese Language DLC and an example of the above is that an English sentence is not written the same way in Japanese.This may be an outdated review where these criticisms have been updated into the game. I probably won't start up this game again unless i'm bored with my usual start-up choices. I suggest looking at forums for update notes, or other reviews. Suggestions towards Sentence Structuring	 I believe the way to improve this is to include a simple sentence structure in which users can drag/click words to input in the basic structure of a sentence going on to improve it as they go on in learning the language advancing to more complex sentence structures. A great platform is already provided in game for us to use(press e/use the computer in order to enable this mini-game)A secondary/optional addition to the sentence structure program is the speech program in which the user talks through a microphone testing their pronunciation versus the correct pronunciation of the sentence at hand. Suggestions towards Alphabet	A fix for the alphabet could be an interactive poster where we could browse the alphabet and try to make words by connecting alphabet letters. Of course in order to learn the alphabet effectively we would also have to learn how to write these characters, so maybe a notebook on the study desk could help us by first showing us how to write the alphabet one stroke at a time then moving on to sentence creation after they unlock it from the computer. Suggestions towards Conversation	Have a set of practice conversations where the user can test the correct response and speak it with their microphone. Example Progression	Interactive Poster Alphabet> connect words> find the item they connect to>learn to write alphabet> learn basic sentence structures> learn how to write basic sentence structures> learn complex sentence structuring> learn how to write complex sentence structures			"

												Delivers exactly what it promises. It's a fun and interactive way to learn a ton of nouns, a few adjectives and verbs of a language of your choice! Does not teach sentences or structure, but it's very useful for learning basic object names as well as pronunciation. It provides both masculine, and feminine versions if there are any, (and neutral of course) as well as alternative nouns that may be used.For the price point I'd say you're getting some pretty good value, especially considering the DLC is 50% off at the moment.

I think I have really increased a lot with my Japanese learning since I took classes! I would reccomend this game to anyone for $10 instead of a $300 class or monthly subscription to a website!			"

												I think the system used is great for learning vocabulary. Unfortunately the the description (""Learn Spanish"" in my case) is misleading. You're not going to learn a language, you'll learn 400 words, which isn't enough for even the simplest of conversations. I gifted the Japanese version to a friend: it took her one afternoon to finish the game.Furthermore, you''l only learn a few verbs and adjectives, and no grammar			"

												I found this game obtuse and dificult to follow. I am a 'visual learner' so expected the contrary. I have only just started and found that the 'game' format of this learning tool does not ease the learning process at all. Another review recomended people interested try memrise.com instead and after following that advise I agree. I am making better progress there and it's free.This game is a cool idea but it has been floundered. It could have been more useful if there was an outdoor area and NPCs to make conversation with.

												Influent is a ok game but has the potential to be so much more.  The game is restricted to a single 3 room apartment so the words that you are able to learn are pretty limited. If you already are learning a language this is a good way to brush up on your vocabulary but not much more.There are few suggestions that I have which I think would improve the game a lot:- Include an entire town, not just a small apartment.- Have a mode where you have to type the name of objects, rather than just recognise the word as it's spoken.- Have built in conversations. For example while exploring the town (if you made it an entire town) have the abbility to approach people and ask them questions. These questions could be predefined and the player just clicks on the one they want to ask. "

												(JP version) I found this very useful. If you are a frequent traveler or plan on relocating, this is definitely for you! You can switch from Romaji to Hiragana works wonders helping familiarize yourself with the characters. Don't get me wrong. This isn't a language course, if you want that, go to your local community college and sign up for classes, lol, you aren't going to be fluent just sitting on your a#$ playing a game. I've read a couple of reviews blasting this game for that very reason. A lot of work goes into learning the nuances of a foreign tongue. This is designed to help you with speed and visual recognition of objects/verbs/adjectives.   "

												I use this to supplement my study of Korean grammar, I just play/use Influent for 30 mins each day, and I'm finding it really useful for learning everyday objects. The verbs and adjectives are a little difficult to play the games with (time attack + fly by) as they are more abstract concepts, but either way, this is a useful tool that stimulates visual, reading, aural, and kinesthetic learning styles through the artificial environment. - If additional material was available for other locations (aside from the apartment providing household object vocab), I'd definitely buy it. Please note, this will not help you SPEAK the language, but will DEFINITELY put you on the right path to learning the vocab you need.			"

												Coming from an educational background, I can see the value in a product like this one.  This is not a game that you want to rent for the weekend.  Influent is a great way to immerse yourself in a target language.  This is a great supplement to explore in your free time.  If you're motivated, and interested in a foreign language please give it a try.  The price point might drive some away.  However, when compared with Rosetta Stone, which can run upwards of $100, it's a steal.  Also, please check out my Youtube check out/review of this game:

Fantastic ToolThis is a fantastic VOCAB tool, note: this is not a language class replacement, it only takes the place of pesky vocab cards and memorization. BE WARNED you will NOT learn how to speak fluently from this game! That said, I absolutely love every aspect of this. This is as close to immersion as you can get, in terms of objects, without having to travel. The music is nice, the enviorment is nice, the game runs smoothly, there isn't much to critize this about. Even then, most of the shortcomings are pretty small and menial. As in, the controls (keyboard and mouse) are a bit clunky and floaty; I found myself misclicking a lot when I first started. There are really only two or so songs in the entire game, while they are pretty catchy it does get a bit annoying. Lastly, there isn't that much in the game; while it seems large to begin with only having 420 words is sorta small and with no expansions (yet?) I will probably find myself without any new conent in the future. Now for my absolute FAVORITE part, THE. GODDAM. FLYBY MODE. It is absolute GENIUS, it is very fun and  controls exceptionally well. I LOVE flying through the apartement shooting the objects, so good!Final word: Is it worth the 10 dollars? ABSOLUTELY, even more so if you can get it on sale! While you won't be breaking out your language skills after using this, it is a very exceptional supplement to your learning. Score I give it: 85/100.			"

												If you do buy this, make sure you understand what you're getting into before purchase. Even though it says 'Learn [Language]', it really means learn vocabulary. There is no context or detailled examples, conjugation, phrasing, or anything else you need to use the vocabulary you get. The adjectives and verbs are sometimes related to the object, but other times the relationship is just bad: computer is linked to intelligent and television is linked to stupid. If you change a noun to a synonym, the linked adjective/verb still use the old noun as the hint.But what it does do is make learning vocabulary by repetition less tedious because of the 'game' presentation. There are some times when items are small and easy to misclick (like the pen and pencil) unless you spend time zooming in or stabilizing your mouse. The airplane reward is novel at first but it wore off quickly and I returned to human mode.I'd recommend something like DuoLingo for a more comprehensive (and free) alternative, but even that isn't a replacement for real world learning or classes. However, one thing you get here that you can't get elsewhere is the ability to go into first person, stare into the mirror and gaze into your character's soulless, unblinking eyes.			"

												I just ""finished"" this game and by that I mean I have mastered all 420 words. Played this game for almost 30 hours and I will keep playing it, as time passes we are bound to forget some words. In a sense you never really finish a game like this. There are two questions you need to ask yourself upon  purchasing  this game. 1- Do you want to just play a different game and have some fun?Answer:  Skip this game if you're looking for something different expecting to have fun, this game is not for you unless you are capable to endure the lack(zero) of story,gameplay and graphics. Trust me you wont have any fun, even I, bought it just to help improve my Mandarin because I though "" Nice, a game and I can learn Mandarin? Must buy it!"" I hoped I would have some fun while studying, inevitably I  would still get bored sometimes.2-  Are studying a language, in college,school or just by yourself, and you plan to use this as an auxiliary device to help you learn faster?Answer: Then this is the perfect game for you.This is my case, I bought it solely to improve my vocabulary and this game is good at doing that, it is a good change from just writing words in a notebook to walk in a room and click on things, see the animations, discover new words then do the time attack. Final  thoughts:I recommend this to anyone( I even recommended this to my girlfriend because she wants to learn Portuguese) that is learning a language or wants to get familiar with one, its a ""fun"" way to do it. Keep this in mind before pressing the purchase button.			"

 A specialized tool that doesnt teach a languageI guess everyone who buys Influent knows, that it is just a vocabulary trainer and does not teach the grammar of any language. That is why I only recommend the game to people, who already have some basic knowledge of the language (like a beginners course or a at least a textbook).I mainly learned Chinese vocabulary, but also looked into Japanese and Italian. Here is some criticism:  It does not tell you some very basic words (like personal pronouns or important phrases)  Chinese uses different words in different regions (e.g. in Taiwan). The game lets you choose between simplified and traditional writing. It also gives you alternative vocabulary, that is used in Taiwan, but just in a very few cases.  Not a problem for Chinese and Japanese, but if you were learning a language like German, not getting the conjugations is bad.  The game only supports ""foreign language => your language"" exercise. When I was finished with the game, I realized that I could not recall a lot of words, when seeing them before me. In the end, I wrote down everything on little cards, so I could practice ""my language => foreign language"". It would be nice, if the game had a test like this.The points I mentioned are serious. However I would still recommend the game, because I learned a lot of words by now and at least it was more fun, than other methods of learning.			"

												This is a legitimately great tool for learning a new language! I feel like it's a little too small, and there are definitely some refinements that could be made (For example, perhaps adding a togglable character list on the side of the screen) but overall it's fun, interesting, and I can see myself using this for quite a while.

http://www.cublikefoot.com/influent-first-impressions/A unique language-learning experience. Although it can’t teach an entire language, it does allow the opportunity to pick up a few words from any of the available languages.I selected Japanese upon opening the game, as I’m interested in learning the language, and I can say, I had a great time with the game. Don’t expect to learn the language from the game, but instead, a couple hundred words and their pronunciations (given time). And yes, I’m still terrible at pronouncing Japanese words, even with this game as a guide.Basically, you’re placed into an apartment with various objects scattered around. You can click on anything, anything, and the word for said object will be displayed and pronounced for you. It’s a pretty cool experience, being able to click on the obscurest of objects (try “ketchup”).There’s also a few minigames to aid in the memorization of sets of words. After hearing a word, you have the opportunity to add it to a personal dictionary of sorts, which can then be used to initiate minigames. One of these games being a “time attack”-ish mode, in which you’re tasked with finding and clicking on objects in sets of ten from your personal dictionary.Overall, Influent is a solid, educational game. It does a great job of teaching some basic words from whatever language is selected and has some pretty nifty minigames.			"

												This is a really awesome language learning too that I hope people take a chance on. I'm learning it to use Korean and it's amazingly practical. I tell people it's the 'virtual equivalent of putting a sticky note with the vocab word on EVERYTHING you own' and they are usually pretty interested. 400 words is a good start, but I want more!			"

												I liked the idea behind this game, but can't recommend it in it's current form.  The house is tiny (really really tiny) and claustrophobic, and the controls are annoying.  I would pay a lot of money for a high quality open world game with language teaching built in.  Make me a compelling game like Skyrim or Vice City with language teaching integrated and I'll happily open my wallet to Ro$etta $tone levels.			"

												Man, I had such high hopes for this game... finally, a language game that's more than just flash-cards (like ""Rosetta Stone"") that can teach language in a new and interesting way!  Like Number ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s did for school-children learning math.Unfortunately, there is no real gameplay or storyline.  You wander around a house looking at objects, and the game tells you how to pronounce them in your language of choice.  Then later you're asked to find the object of the given name.  It's just flash-cards disguised as a 3D application, which makes it much more tedious since you have to rummage through a messy house trying to figure out where you saw that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wristwatch.So though I really *really* wanted to like this game, I have to give it a thumbs-down.  For now I will go back to my Anki deck, which is the same thing but stripped down to just actual flash-cards.And I still have hopes that someday, someone will make a good language game that's an actual *game*.

												WARNING: One shouldn't expect to learn any grammar from this game or be able to master a language simply by playing this.Having said that, Influent is pretty handy for learning BASIC vocabulary, consisting of 420 words. It's a cute little game that allows the player to walk around a small apartment and click on various objects. Upon clicking on these objects, you can hear and/or see the word for it in whatever language you have chosen. With these in tow, you may play a mini game that speaks and/or shows vocabulary words and then you have to go wherever that item is located and click on it.I don't think it was quite worth the $9.99 I spent in order to buy it, but never the less, it's very handy for keeping up with vocabulary. So maybe try catching it on sale for about half the price, if this seems like your kind of thing.For me personally, it's handy and helpful, so that's good enough.			"

												If you want a chance to learn in a fun environment, you are better off checking out duolingo (a completely free online language tool) which is just as enjoyable and includes more language development skills than just vocab without any grammatical context. I was hoping there would be more of a game like atmosphere to this but it was just point and click at objects. You could do the same thing walking around your own house with google.			"

												On its own, this won't make you fluent as it only teaches words, however in conjunction with a free language learning program such as Duolingo, this is perfect! It makes learning feel more like a game rather than a chore and allows you to pick up words pretty fast. I'm personally using it for French and like it so far, I only wish the apartment were a tad bit bigger. for only $10 though, its great. It's a great idea worth supporting and trying.			"

												Language purchased: Mandarin Chinese.Before I say anything else about this game, I am playing it having already studied Mandarin Chinese for two years. That said, the game has been a really fun and effective way for me to brush up on my vocabulary, and learn plenty of new words. When studying another language, you don't always learn the words for all these little things, and there is a ton of stuff in this game. Usually you'll learn some essentials like clothes and some furniture, but the game has all sorts of other things too, from household appliances like a blender, to food, paintings, comics, a skateboard, and basically anything else you might find in a small apartment. The diversity of the vocabulary is really nice, and on a lot of words there are bonus words to unlock which are usually verbs or adjectives associated with those words. While the game certainly doesn't teach you anything about things like sentence structure, grammar, or other things you need to acutally be able to speak the language, it's a great way to get started. Plus, $9.99 is a great deal on any language learning tool.			"

												I'm going through this for Japanese.Ok, I'll recommend this for the people who are:1. Already taking a Japaese program using a proper textbook like Genki (I have already gone through I & II with around 12 months of weekly classes)2. Already know how to read kana and just need to brush up a bit3. Has a firm grasp of Japanese grammar (learned your particles sentence structure elsewhere)You will learn VOCAB from this program. You'll get a lot of everyday nouns, adjectives and verbs to go with them.YOU WILL NOT LEARN ANYTHING ELSE!This is a great supplemental flash-card like program for remembering your kanji for some words (play without voice) and brushing up on your kana if you're a bit rusty, but that's all it is. It's basically a stack of flashcards, in game-format. And it is a GREAT set of interactive flash cards.If you're going into it expecting more, you will be disappointed.			"

Posted: February 21, 2016
												I bought this game with the understanding that it was meant to help with vocabularly acquisition, so I'm going to base my review on two things: How effective it is as a vocabularly acquisition tool and if the price of the game is reasonable. I should also note that I purchased the German version of Influent, so my review is based entirely on that. EffectivenessPros  Handles nouns well Interactivity Cons  Handles neither adjectives nor verbs well Controls can be clunky and fustrating  Managing vocab lists can be time consuming Handles articles and gender very poorly. Does not provide plural version of nounsThe thing that separates Influent from other language learning tools is its interactivity. Being able to walk around a virtual room and interact with the environment is a major perk, especially for more ""hands on"" learners. Unfortunately, the controls can be very clunky at times; this, however, is not game breaking and its something that the player can get used to after awhile. The fly-by mode that gets activated later in the game is funny at first, but it gets old fast and thankfully is something that isn't a necessary part of gameplay. Besides the interactivity, the other major gameplay feature in Influent is the vocabularly lists. As words are acquired through interacting with the environment, they are added to a word bank and vocabularly lists are automatically formed based on the order in which the words were originally acquired. The words can be rearranged in the word bank to create custom lists, but this is an arduous process: You have to manually click and drag each word, which can be fustrating when sorting through a large word bank. After compiling vocabularly lists, the player can test themselves with a time attack mode. The problem is that the player can only do ten words at a time. A random mode can also be selected, where a random vocabularly list is selected for time attack mode. This gameplay feature is sorely limited by the fact that the random mode randomizes vocabularly lists, rather than creating new lists by randomizing words. This means that the arduous process of creating vocabularly lists is largely unavoidable, because the player will get very little out of Influent unless they take the time to organize the word bank. Influent handles nouns well, and it also includes the article for each noun (der, die, das); Influent, however, only plays an audio recording for the noun and not for the article. When learning German, it's vital to learn the article with the word, because the article is crucial for sentence structure, grammar, and meaning. Learning the word without the article places the learner at a significant disadvantage. This is why the importance of placing emphasis on the article cannot be understated. Influent does a disservice to those learning German by not playing a recording of the article along with the word. Influent handles adjectives and verbs so poorly that it'd be better off not including them at all. The first problem is that these words are acquired by clicking on nouns in the word bank, which can be a huge pain; furthermore, acquiring them through the word bank robs the player of the ability to acquire them through interaction with the environment, which is the selling point for Influent. A translation for adjectives and verbs is not provided to the player until they pop up during time attack mode, which is extremely fustrating. More importantly, in German the adjectives and verbs change based on the article and on the context, but there is no indication of this in the game. I'll use an example here to illustrate the problem. One verb that pops up in the word bank is ignorieren,"" which is the verb ""to ignore."" During time attack mode, the player will need to click on a newspaper when this verb pops up. When clicking on the newspaper, it'll say that it's correct and then it will provide the following translation: Ignore(The Newspaper). Likewise, it will do the same with verbs. For example: Neu, which is ""new"" will pop up in the translator as ""new(Newspaper)."" The problem is that these word change based on the article! This game would give one the impression that it's correct to say, ""Ich ignorieren die neu Zeitung,"" when it's actually, ""Ich ignoriere die neue Zeitung."" Influent is ineffective as a vocabularly acquistion tool, because it can potentially mislead learners. The interactivity piece is all Influent has going for it, but this piece has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the before mentioned problems reduce Influent to the status of being a language learning supplement to other language learning tools that do a better job at teaching vocabularly. Influent simply fails at what it sets out to do. The PriceThe question is whether or not Influent is worth $10. I'd say that $5 would be more reasonable, because of all the before mentioned problems. The current price tag isn't too bad though, especially when one considers the cost of other language learning materials. When buying Influent you're really just paying for the interactivity, because there are other language programs out there that blow Influent out of the water as vocabularly acquistion tools. VerdictI do not recommend Influent at the current price. I think that Influent would benefit more if the creator focused on increasing the quality of each language, rather than on providing more languages. If Influent is on sale, however, it may be worth buying (especially if it's in the $3-5 range).			"

												Disclaimer: I have only played the German DLC of this game, and have not played any of the other DLCs, so I can only judge on the German DLC.This is a pretty good 'language learning' game, it does have some flaws, such as it not really helping with grammar or phrases, but it also is pretty useful as a vocabulary game. It's gameplay is a bit.... lacking, but it has some really good achievements. It has very humourous parts to it, as well as it's storyline.There are few language learning games on Steam, and to be fair, this isn't really much of a 'language learning' game, sure it's a good aid for learning language, but it doesn't ahve anything to do with grammar or phrases, more of a vocabulary game. Don't get this game if you expect it to teach you an entire language, to learn a language, it's best to have many different sources, and this is a very useful source, although it is nothing on it's own. If you have started learning a language and need help with vocabulary, it's good for you, or even if you have not learnt a spot of the language, it's an okay starting point, to help you get used to the language. The gameplay in this is limited, as you are locked in a house, and cannot escape. This is kind of a 'bottle episode' in that respect. You can go into first person and third person, you cannot jump, and you can open doors with the right mouse button (although the only door you can't open is the front door, believe me, I have tried), as well as being able to interact with other things. Being locked inside your house, with no indication of the passing of time, and with the only dislogue being you saying the names of objects to yourself, it makes it a pretty surreal game to play. You have to walk around and collect nouns, adjectives and verbs of your choosen language. There are quite a few words to collect, and it's half impossible to get them all, as there will always be something you miss. There are some pretty good achievements for this game as well, which is great incentive to learn more words. When you collect ten words you can do a quick quiz, where you can walk around while a word is on screen, and you need to find it in the room.The story of this excuses it to not teaching you about grammar or phrases. It is about a guy who made a device that tells you what an object's name is in another language, but the idea is pirated and patented by someone else, and you need to prove that you made the device, and only you know how the device works, so if you can collect 400 words and master them, then you can prove that you made the device. I don't know if anything happens after you collect all the words, as I have one word left, and I cannot find it, but I expect that it has a funny ending, either that or nothing happens, wither way, it's worth it. If you are learning a language or not I'd recommend this game, as it is a useful resource for learning a language, but it's also good if you're not learning one, as it never hurts to know more about other languages, it doesn't hurt to know other words for things in other languages. If you are learning a language I'd suggest you use other sites as well, such as  Duolingo [www.duolingo.com] ,  Memrise [www.memrise.com] or  Babbel	[www.babbel.com] , but that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy this game. This games helps very much to give you a visual, an audio and a written of the words.			"

In a 3D environment, a house, you freely interact with items to know their word, pronounciation and others. You can add them to your learning word-list whenever you want and in the order you want. When you are ready you can choose a page of 10 words to begin learning them. You can set up everything including pronounciation and word display. Then you need to find and click on the related item randomly chosen in the 10 word-list, the timer is also here to show you if you're good enough or not. The aim of the game is to master every word, 420 in total, including nouns, adjectives and verbs from items to child's items. The game also immerse you in the real enrvironment as your native's translation of each items is hidden but you can always see it in your word list by clicking on the red eye.When you start a game you choose the language you want to learn, so there is an independent save for each language and you can create several save for a same language I guess. Also for the asian languages you can choose to learn with PINYIN or ideogram, after the choice made you can't switch it in game so you need to make two game sessions.			"

												Its a nice vocabulary leaning game and if u are creative enough, u can expand the game yourself. For example, first u have to explore your appartment, there are a lot of things to get to know, in boxes, shelfs, everywhere and everything, and when u have explored enough u can do a vocabulary run game. There a narrator tells u to find the words shown up, and when the word show up u can imagine the story to it, u have to know verbs (so additional if u are already learning a language or u learn 4 yourself, verb trainer would be cool as [free] dlc!!!!and present, past and future table would be awesome), If the Narrator tells u to find a book, u can say ""i read a book"", and so on. ( u can make it more complex and involve the next item showing up, its funny too to make a story out of it) :DSo i hope the developers will do some more places to be (DLC). A park or so. And u can imagine and simulate alot of situations and learn a language more complex.			"

												Influent is a relatively interesting style of ""game"" to aid in the building of vocabulary.  By associating what is familair with the foreign language, it speeds up the memorization of the new words.  By looking around and highlighting a given item, you can get the name for it in the requested language.  The learning is context based, so it helps bridge the gap that having the translation often leads in learning. Like most vocabulary programs/books/tapes, it is no substitute for a qualified teacher, but if you have one, then this makes an excellent supplement. Overall, I would reccomend this game to aid students of a foreign language, but I cannot reccomend any game that does not allow key remapping.			"

												Excellent addition for someone who is already committed to learning a language. The words are all commonly used and important for converastion, and learning in the context of a 3d space simulates the immersion you have walking around in another country where written words are reinforced with quality audio spoken words. Its also done something that most of the language apps make only a half hearted attempt to do, is it makes it fun to learn and rewards you for your memorization and recognition speed. Well done!			"

												I highly recommend this to anyone learning languages. I'm currently learning French and this has by far been the best method to have the vocab sink in. However, be aware that this is only vocab, don't expect to go in and finish up speaking the language.The vocab to learn is spot on though, a great list of every day objects, adjectives and even verbs. For the price you honestly could not ask for better. If I had this in back in Secondary School my marks would have been the tops. I hope to see further updates and more content, I'd be happy to pay more for an expansion.Le jeu c'est bonne!			"

												I think the game is great. I've been using it for a while now and it's perfect for us visual learners. Obviously you would have to use it in combination with other language books, software, etc. since it only teaches you vocabulary, but for $10 it's an innovative and effective way to learn. After a few hours of using Influent I can look around my house just like in the game and say what the objects are in Swedish. I've tried other language software (and are still using them), but this one certainly taught me vocabulary the fastest. I also found the game extremely engaging so you don't get bored or frustrated while learning. The game is everything it said it would be so I'm not dissapointed at all. In fact, I find it fun and worth the $10.			"

												This is such an amazing game for learning japanese.I struggle with learning vocab because I don't usually like the repetative nature.However, Influent makes the task surprisingly enjoyable.You have the option of using romanji, katakana and hirigana or kanji.I've been playing the game with hirigana but once I know the words better I want to use the kanji option to learn the kanji.You can also test yourself using only the written word or the spoken word.I plan on using only the written word once I'm comfortable with the kanji to focus on the characters.The adjectives and verbs are also surprisingly relevant. There is a good choice of words that I would have otherwise not learnt.I hope theres a sequel... maybe one down a road so that you can learn all the buildings etc...			"

												The game is simple but fun. You walk around a room and double click objects to see what they are called in the language you are learning. Add these words to a list and when you have 10, you can test yourself on them. From there you build more lists and earn stars for mastering words that are used to unlock more complicated words such as adjectives and verbs.The Chinese that is being taught is the mainland Beijing accent with simplified characters. Both Chinese and Japanese have the ability to switch to their English phonetic variants respectively (pinyin/romaji). However, if you already know some Chinese characters, kanji, hiragana and katakana the game is helpful in reinforcing those areas as well as teaching new characters. As far as I can tell there is nothing in the game that reinforces your ability to write the characters, but the game will definitely help you learn how to read and recognize hanzi (汉字) and kanji (漢字).

												It may take some time to get used to it but the game certainly is useful c: I got the Japanese as my base and was greeted with walls of text toutorials from a little robot. After going through that you get to wander around the house (and veeeery small apartment with only 4 rooms and no hallways). Its very straight farward and easy to understand, but it will still take quite a bit of time and practice to learn any new languages. Though these means offer a more fun solution to that problem c: I definately recommend.			"

												Within the first hour or so of gameplay, you will likely have found out everything there is to do in the game (with the exception of perhaps finding all 420 words). The question I guess is ""Is it worth it?""I bought the Japanese DLC as I wanted another resource/option when it came to learning the language and had NO EXPECTATIONS apart from obviously being able to learn something.SUMMARIZING THE EXPERIENCE : It is an interactive way of learning basic words ( Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives ) and perhaps that is what it is meant for - Learning SOME basic words. Spoiler below contains elaborationAs many others have and will point out - The game (as both a game and/or interactive learning/educational software) is very stale in its options. The entire game revolves around memorizing 10 words (either random or your selection) at a time and contains 2 modes of doing so - Either walk around and click on objects to learn how to say them in the language you wish to study or do so while piloting a toy plane (as shown in the trailer). The game is also extremely simple to the point where certain parts are confusing and others quite redundant :For example, having two ways of saying 'Book' - ほん (hon) and しょせき (shoseki) where after googling, according to wiki ""The former term only indicates bound books, and does not include scrolls. The latter is used for printed matter only. The most general term is 書物 (shomotsu), which means all written or printed matter that has been collected into a single unit, regardless of construction."" Whereas the game only says [This] & [That] = Book.Another example is when clicking on a 'Door' and going to 'Verb', it tells me しめる (shimeru) and ひらく (hiraku) means 'Open' (as in to open the door) when the first actually means 'to close/shut'.At the end of the day however, do I recommend this game for $10 USD (or the price according to region) for what it offers?...If you asked me that in a nutshell, I would say No because to any beginner trying to learn a language, chances are it might do more harm than good. ( Yes, you learn words but having googled to confirm the definitions I am skeptical as to what I learn is indeed what is translated in-game. )However if given the chance to elaborate and tell people ""Look, this is what you're going to get and a lot of things require confirmation on the internet."" then yes. Mainly because, this is another resource that can interest and provocate people to stop procrastinating and start learning a language (although it definitely can be improved in many ways). For me, that is good enough because I know motivation and determination are one of the hardest things to muster.Maybe people were looking for something better but thinking about it, how one would go about explaining all the parts of the language from sentence structure to specifics on the language (in a game) might make it too complex for a beginner and confuse them even further.

												The game is less of a game and more of an exploration of the interior of your house.  I would have been just as happy with horrible graphics and more content, even more so a story mode of sorts that requires you to learn the language as you progress.  For example, The character could be a foreign exchange student that learns the basics of the language by living with a friend that slowly teaches you words of utility.  Then the game could expand to situations like love, getting a job, and becoming closer with the people that the character lives with.  As it stands, its just a fancy♥♥♥♥♥dictionary that doesn't create a desire to learn anything.			"

												Very simple words. I'm at only 50 words in Spanish. I've been playing with both text & audio, for the most part. I find myself going over the same list several times before very often doing (many) random time trials, to test my memory. This is fun & I feel like I'm really making some progress. I'm eager to learn more. Most of the words learned are for simple everyday household items, and the game could probably do with an update at some point to expand a new location with new words, but ""everyday words"" are basically the best words (in my opinion) for a beginner to be starting at.Anyways, yeah, I reccommend this.

Mess around and find out how to say words you never knew. Great for language starters and folks who dont want to start a language class just yet. You can learn up to about 400 words per language so basically its like taking the first class of the language minus the grammar. Good review as well			"

												This is a great game and a great concept, but with limited applications.  I'm a few hours into two languages with which I'm pretty familiar, for context.  It's essentially a creative and fun way to practice vocabulary.  If you're a beginner, or want to brush up on your household vocab this is great, but don't expect more than that.  The aesthetic is great, the music is nice, the controls are mostly good.  The ""fly-by"" mode could be a bit easier to control.  I find myself spending more energy trying to control the plane than remembering the words, but then if you don't want that the regular time-attack mode suffices.  I have found a number of places where the controls give me trouble clicking on smaller objects (ie: answer is ""wrench"" but I fail time after time because the mouse selects the toolbox instead) On the language side of things, this game is wonderful.  The fact that it keeps the lists, keeps track of your answers, and has a randomize function is amazing.  Additionally, it does non-roman scripts very well.  Japanese is presented in 3 options (Kanji, Kana, or Romaji) and there are multiple options for Chinese and Russian as well for those starting off on vocabulary, but who haven't mastered the related scripts quite yet.  I'm 50/50 on the issue of articles.  The game DOES have them.  When you select a word and bring up its details the gender is listed underneath the word.  But those pronouns (el/la, der/die/das, etc...) are not in the spoken notes, so you have to remind yourself of them on your own.  (ie: the audio is ""Computer"", but the text is ""Computer - [Masc]"").  Those spoken demonstrations of vocabulary have been in my experience mostly good, but ocassionally not of the best quality.All in all, well done.  I hope this game develops further in the future.  That front door is just begging for me to master x number of words and be allowed through it and out into the big wide world full of fun vocab to practice.			"

												(This is based on the Spanish version.) This game is a bit of a misnomer; it is not a language-learning game but a vocabulary-learning game. In that respect it's a great tool to supplement actual language learning. In fact it goes really well with Duolingo, which is much stronger on grammar but weak on a lot of very basic, everyday vocabulary that is present here. It's also a little bit less of a game than a gamified study tool, because how well you do really depends on how much you put into it. If you just fly through the time attacks and gather up words, your retention won't be that good. If you have the patience to limit yourself to, say, 20 words per session, 10 nouns and 10 verbs/adjectives, and replay the Time Attacks with various options on and off, it's a great way to learn the vocabulary in a visual context.

It's a great idea, but I feel that they spent too much time developing limited gameplay/learning in too many languages. You walk around a house and learn some vocabulary for words, but absolutely nothing more. No grammar, no sentence structure, no cultural context. You don't learn a language that way. I'm disappointed because I wanted so much more out of the game; playing a game that helps you learn a language is a GREAT idea. However, this is just not exceuted well. Save the $9.99 and buy a beginner phrase book to get started instead.			"

												Influent (Espanol) teaches you just enough spanish to trick people into thinking you know spanish. This will always end badly since this program teaches vocab only (as described) and not how to put the words together. It's alright though, because once you have mastered this program you will be the fully functional equivalent of a Mexican toddler, able to excitedly point at items around the house and poorly imitate a native speaker's practiced voice. Everybody has to start somewhere though, and this is a fantastic way to dip your toe in the waters  without becoming overwhelmed.			"

												The game has a great potential and I like the idea of a real immersive learning method. Its a good resource and wonderful tool that can be perfectly combined with a common way of studying languages.  I just feel that it is in a early stage yet and I hope after some years, with more investments and a big company supporting the project you can make it more useful and funny to play.Sorry about my English. XD頑張ってね　			"

												This is a great game and a great concept, but with limited applications.  I'm a few hours into two languages with which I'm pretty familiar, for context.  It's essentially a creative and fun way to practice vocabulary.  If you're a beginner, or want to brush up on your household vocab this is great, but don't expect more than that.  The aesthetic is great, the music is nice, the controls are mostly good.  The ""fly-by"" mode could be a bit easier to control.  I find myself spending more energy trying to control the plane than remembering the words, but then if you don't want that the regular time-attack mode suffices.  I have found a number of places where the controls give me trouble clicking on smaller objects (ie: answer is ""wrench"" but I fail time after time because the mouse selects the toolbox instead) On the language side of things, this game is wonderful.  The fact that it keeps the lists, keeps track of your answers, and has a randomize function is amazing.  Additionally, it does non-roman scripts very well.  Japanese is presented in 3 options (Kanji, Kana, or Romaji) and there are multiple options for Chinese and Russian as well for those starting off on vocabulary, but who haven't mastered the related scripts quite yet.  I'm 50/50 on the issue of articles.  The game DOES have them.  When you select a word and bring up its details the gender is listed underneath the word.  But those pronouns (el/la, der/die/das, etc...) are not in the spoken notes, so you have to remind yourself of them on your own.  (ie: the audio is ""Computer"", but the text is ""Computer - [Masc]"").  Those spoken demonstrations of vocabulary have been in my experience mostly good, but ocassionally not of the best quality.All in all, well done.  I hope this game develops further in the future.  That front door is just begging for me to master x number of words and be allowed through it and out into the big wide world full of fun vocab to practice.			"

Wish I could get a refund instead of having supported some so-called ""internationalizing"" effort that actually just treats non-English languages as inferior and not worth learning.			"

												im not visual learner, so it's kind of hard to get used with the language (mine is japanese one). but i think this game is  good for children, as the mechanics seems only just have you to click and memorize the word(s) for the object that you've clicked. And I don't think my opinion matters anyway, but i can not recommend  this game to buy for fun. it's not fun, but it's good to teach your child foreign langueage. that's it.			"

												Influent (Espanol) teaches you just enough spanish to trick people into thinking you know spanish. This will always end badly since this program teaches vocab only (as described) and not how to put the words together. It's alright though, because once you have mastered this program you will be the fully functional equivalent of a Mexican toddler, able to excitedly point at items around the house and poorly imitate a native speaker's practiced voice. Everybody has to start somewhere though, and this is a fantastic way to dip your toe in the waters  without becoming overwhelmed.			"

												If you are looking for a fun way to gain ""word recognition"" (mostly of nouns) then this is a fun way to learn household objects in whatever language you choose.You will not learn ""travel"" related words, and even the model airplane in the game is label and translated as ""toy"" rather than ""toy airplane."" For the great, low price of about $10 you can start a really fun way of learning a language. If you decide you want to try to learn these same words in other languages, then the DLC option is an inexpensive and incredibly affordable way of learning. The retail price point on this software (currently $10 for a base language and $5 or less for another language) is very fair for what it is and does. I hope the developer expands the four room ""house"" to include some outdoor items one day, but that is a large venture when they plan to support so many languages.CONS: The words have only one speed of pronunciation, and sometimes the recorded audio has some volume problems that is not baseline with the rest of the audio files. Also, there are a lot of other ""common life"" items that could/should have been included; for example, instead of a just a ""photo"", the creator could have had a photo, and next to that a ""family photo"" with a ""man""/""father"", ""woman""/""mother""...etc. Overall, I'd really recommend the software if you are looking to dive in and gain some rot memorization skills in a language. Don't expect to read, write, or speak a sentence with this, and you will be happy with the gameplay and results of you learning some new words in another language.			"

												I plan on doing a video review on this game on my YouTube channel, StephanieTsunami. Check it out if you’d rather hear this review than read it!Formal Review:Influent is an original, language-learning, interactive game. With the ability to learn words at your own leisure, mix and match words to create your OWN vocab quiz, and a large selection of words to get to know as if they were your native language makes this game outstanding. ""Influent was originally developed as part of a research project at the Entertainment Computing Laboratory at the University of Tsukuba in Japan ... Influent successfully passed Steam Greenlight in January 2014, following the full release on March 20, 2014 on the Steam Store and Humble Store."" The fact that this game has not been released a full year is surprising, yet evident. With a full release, many updates would have been made if there weren’t financial issues. With $28,086 out of the pledged $12,000 goal set on Kickstarter, $2000 was appointed to a Unity Pro license, and $500 for the shipping, shirts, and other fun items for the backers; although, some of the prices were updated. These would be the $1500 plan to go mobile, the $8000 dedicated to publishing the game, and $1500 was put toward a better computer to create a game masterpiece. Two people paired together in Japan to create a Kickstarter that placed a game on the market. The game has only been updated on Steam three times since the official release. These updates included (but are not limited to) fixing minor errors such as audio pronunciations, German and French words, volume levels, Vocab list major malfunctions, and improved texture in 1.3, German Language Pack mistakes, lag, windowed mode, and text errors in 1.4, and finally text and GUI element errors in 1.5. These updates do not include the rush to add more languages - currently there are 12 Language Packs for sale.Personal Review:The love I feel for this game in the past week is exceptionally strong. Personally, I have trouble remembering things such as object names, and to be able to run through a list as many times as I need is blissful. The idea of circling around your character’s apartment-like home and collecting the names of items that may include synonyms, verbs, and adjectives is clever and just what I’ve been looking for in my life. Influent plus a little more studying on articles, conjunctions, prepositions, and other grammar mechanics of the desired language for (at least) $10 versus $500 for a normally-priced Rosetta Stone Software for 5 users… I think Influent wins. Regarding the accuracy of the languages, I have yet to test it out against my German or Russian or Korean friends (no offence to any translator but it’s a necessity). Last but not least, graphics. I’m a graphics junkie, but the fact that this game is so simple-themed revert the player’s mind to focus on the learning, not the mechanics, graphics, or errors of the game.Note to the Creator:I understand that it’s been less than a year and there’s still a lot of progress to be made, but I would like to offer some ideas. There could be a separate “scene” or “level” the character could play on. Once the player succeeds in mastering the 420 words of the apartment home, there could be another level, as in a park setting, a city setting, or an office/school setting. These levels could even be more of mini-maps if necessary! At the end of each level, the player must pass “The Official Vocab Test” in order to proceed. Once all stages are complete, there could be a lesson on grammar mechanics, sentence parts, conjunctions, and spelling. Have you thought of introducing this to schools? Middle school/junior high foreign language classes would be absolutely thrilled to find a class assistant like this. That brings me back to “Leveling Up”. In a regular foreign language class, a student must first learn the basics – objects, which is majority of what Influent provides. The next step in class is verbs and adjectives – many of which are provided by Influent. The typical class ends with articles and phrases – this is where Influent is lacking. That’s why I think it would be best for middle school/junior high students. If there was a difficulty setting in the game, I would recommend it to high school students, but the game in its current state is too young, too simple, and lacking content. I think the age suggestion would be 10-15 years old. There is a lot of potential in this game and I don’t want to see it fail. I can’t really back this game financially, but I can certainly back it by suggesting it to many teachers and friends.Thank you so much for reading this – if you did – and let's watch this game grow into something bigger!

												Highly recommended for those wanting to learn a new language, especially those who have recently moved to a new country or travel a lot!I bought the game a few months ago, I came across it by accident when I was searching for language games. I've tried various programs and sites in the past, but they either didn't have the option for Finnish or they just didn't help me progress at my speed. I'm really happy that I found this game, even things like reading signs or labels in shops when I visit Finland has been so much easier. (So far I've 310 words in!)To give you a general idea of the game: you play as a guy who walks around his apartment and he introduces you to items in the language you're learning. You hit the spacebar to remember the word, and every ten words you get a little quiz where the word appears on screen and you find it. It's very much a game which goes at your pace: you select the words and you decide when to test yourself. There's no grammar, just nouns, adjectives and verbs to help you first get to grips with the language.The quiz can also be tailored to fit you. Something which I found out about myself when I was playing this was how often I relied on seeing the word for the item that I needed to find. So, I decided to change that and see if I can do it without any visual help, and just by hearing the words. That much harder to do and the options for the quizzes really help you become familiar with the language. Once you're familiar with a word, you receive a gold star next to it. If you're struggling with a specific item, the game will make a mark next to it, informing you that it's one that you may need to revise. I've also bought this game, as well as the English and German language packs, for my friend's kid as she's learning those in school. I would love to see the developers expand further with the game, perhaps having the character walk around an office, or a shop. That would be really useful!			"

												The thought that this game would teach Spanish was astounding to me before I had spent my $10 on it. Although learning 420 common words used within a home (more specifically an apartment in which you are locked inside), this game fails to teach how to connect the words into sentences, how to conjugate and literally locks you inside  one room to have you learn only nouns, Verbs and Adjectives. This game is great for High School students for about a quarter of a Semester: when they are just learning the words.  Adding an Air plane to help you explode into the objects in the room sure does bring a twist to the game though, as it is the only feature that brings action in the game. If Developers were to open this game up to the Steam Community for Map ideas, I am positive that the community would help in making sure the learning experience is not in the small space that it currently is in. Researching and adding new languages is great, only that with each new language the players has to go through the same monotonous room to find 420 words. As unique as it is, the game needs more originality, some action to keep the players interested in the game while teaching languages /fluently/. The idea of such a game is amazing, but it just needs more work before it could reach the full potential.			"

												Now don't misunderstand, it's not that I dislike this game, but after several hours of playing it, I felt it was misleading. This is not something that helps to learn a language as such, but more just vocabulary, and only what can be found in a home. I was hoping for something closer to an actual (if simple) language teacher with a little fun thrown in. My standards weren't very high, but I had expected at least basic sentence structure and grammar to be covered. It does not 'primarily' focus on vocabulary, it ONLY focuses on vocabulary. I suppose it is more fun than flash cards, but it is the exact same thing. It is better to buy a tourist guide to basic language for your $10, unless you have the extra money to burn on 3D flashcards.The airplane minigame is fun and the graphics are cute in a shabby/kickstarted kind of way, but the controls are difficult. I spent my money before reading the reviews, so I'll get all I can out of the game, but I don't think you should buy this.			"

												Influent puts you in a sort of small apartment space and you are able to move around using the standard gaming movement keys which are W, A, S, D and you can rotate your view by holding the right mouse button. I love that this game offers you the chance to learn SWEDISH (My mother-language) want proof? try pronouncing the swedish word ""Kanelbulle"" as an non-swedish native-born. Got it right? in case you didn't its : Kan-el-bu-lle , sorry about that xD if you're wondering what ""Kanel"" means in english it's actually : Cinnamon and ""Bulle"" means ""bun"". So ""Kanelbulle"" actually means ""Cinnamon Bun"" in english. Anyways...moving on...i bought the Chinese version of Influent and also later bought the Norwegian language DLC because who doesn't love (some) Norwegian words that just sounds so funny like ""Gulrot"" which pretty similiarly in swedish translates to Morot or in english : Carrot. I bought this game because i wanted to learn chinese as my 2nd language of choice but in this game you can just learn (some) words in the available languages and not entire sentences. This game is 10/10 if you want to learn quick and sometimes difficult (words) but then again no sentences. My rating for this game you wonder? that would a 9/10 because it offers no sentences - 詹姆斯			"

Obviously if you're serious about learning your chosen language, take it at school, university or a language class but this game is the perfect tool for helping you to learn vocabulary in a fun way. Hope they bring out some DLCs for learning vocabulary in other areas such as the backyard, school or work etc.			"

												Overall I enjoy this ""game"", I feel as though it is a fun interactive way to learn around 400 words in another language. Don't get it if you are expecting to learn how to speak a language, this is mainly a tool to help build your vocabulary. In no way does this teach you any grammar rules or how to put together sentences.One thing that I did appreciate was that, (for at least the Spanish version), it gave you the option to choose a synonym for the translation of the chosen term rather than the one the game uses by default, this was helpful because certain terms I had already known by other translations. I bought the game on sale for $2, and I feel like I've got enough out of it for that price. I don't think I would have purchased it for its original price-point of $10 though. There are alternative free options out there for learning languages, such as Duolingo. But I enjoyed the fact that this provided a 3D rendering of an apartment and had you move around finding the objects in a quiz-like manner. Actually seeing and searching for the items on a 3-dimensional plane helped me remember certain terms better than just using notecards or an alternate method.			"

												I wouldn't necessarily call it a ""language learning game"" but rather a ""vocabulary learning game"".The game is actually good at what it does! It's a fun and easy way to learn vocab which is a nice addition if you are learning a language. The more words you know the more ways you have making up sentences with the knowledge aquired beforehand. It is pretty much as effective as using spaced repetition programs such as Anki, except that it costs something. Yet, I do recommend the game because you don't get to study like this everday. Do wait for a sale though, 10€ is quite a bit.			"

												Only teaches you random words here and there, does absolutely nothing to teach you the grammatics, usage, pronounciation or alphabeth, which i was interested in learning.While word knowledge does help, the words picked for the japanese language one in particular are pretty poor choices.I really don't need this game to understand, for example, the words included in it(pronounce them): doa, doafreimu, supeakaa, keeboordo, monitaa, bokksu, eacon, telebi, matto, banana, video geimu, braindo, et.c. The teaching is also a very simple and awfully basic ""point at object"" which will do little to nothing to teach you the language. Where are the common useful phrases, like say, places of anatomy, ""can you guide me to X"", ""how much is the fish"" and ""is that a banana in your pocket or is your hovercraft just full of eels?""?Given that it's a simple memorization of random words, i really can't recommend it. You're better off learning japanese watching english subbed japanese television, and you'll probably pick up more words that way if you actively try. I can't imagine how on earth this could in any fashion teach you finnish either, considering the grammatics involved within.			"

												Please do not think of this as a game, as much as a tool for understanding the language of your choice. Understanding I bought this only yesterday, I do think I have made some progress in Japanese. There is a great deal to get used to by way of controls. The mouse often will select an item I did not intend, and I find I must left-click harder than normal sometimes to get any response. When I do that, the game usually perceives this as if I had selected this item twice, a complication during tests. The biggest issue with me is that whatever vocabulary mastery I gain, and in the case of Japanese, also mastery of the Japanese character, this does not appear to be something to test by putting into sentences and conversation. Then again, it's only $9.99, so I'd say not all bad. With this in mind, I offer a mixed recommendation, for those who would like to use this as a fairly serious stepping stone toward understanding a new language.			"

												I've always found grammar interesting, but for some odd reason I could never be bothered to learn new words. Of course, without vocabulary one can't practice grammar. If you think that you are incapable of learning a language, I can assure you that if you can memorize at-least a set or two, you'll be well on your way. This won't teach you the whole language as it mainly focuses on vocabulary, but you can find plenty of grammar books online.			"

												Quite an okay game which will teach you basics of the chosen language in environment of house. However, it is not that fun if you don't know basics of the language or you don't actually plan to learn that language. If you are starting a new language and want to improve your vocabulary with few words, go ahead and buy it. If you are not interested in languages, don't consider buying it.Pros:Items that have multiple names are often listed after doubleclicking the item.Some of the items also provide verbs or adjectives related to them, not only the noun.Can enhance your vocabulary a little.Cons:Mastering the words is too repetetive, if you missclick an object, especially in a fridge, repeating all the words is then infinite.DLCs are too expensive considering it is just a simple translation of the game.Start is fun, but after few hours it feels like you are not really thinking about what was the item, but where is that item hidden.6/10			"

												Since the other reviews already encompassed the really important points I'll settle for the most important points:-This game ONLY teaches vocabulary, nouns, adjectives and verbs to be precise-It is REALLY good at teaching that vocabulary-It ONLY teaches you 420 words (as of now)That being said, as a tool to help with learning a language Influent is great. Having that basic vocabulary really helps with being able to learn the grammar of a given language.This is the kind of games were I'd love to see masses of DLCs, like being able to go out into the city, to the forest, to the beach... you know, all the places and all the words. I hope they throw out a Kickstarter for these DLCs or Influent 2 or something sometime.			"

												Been wanting to learn Spanish for a long time now, but the usual methods of using text books or the ""repeat this phrase after me"" audio tutors just never clicked with me.  Now this ""game"" has arrived with its unique visual way of learning a new language.  Perfect!  I've just learned 10 new Spanish words, both written and aurally, in only about 30 minutes - and it hasn't felt like a chore at all.  I think the game has about 400 words, so that will take me at least 20 hours.  From there I can go on to learn grammar and how to put the words into sentence and by that time hopefully Influent 2 will be out! :)			"

												After an hour of playing, the game is basically trying to ram into your brain the vocabulary of the language versus the form in which it is spoken. It one case, that makes sense as increasing your vocabulary can help you with the language. However, language is all about the structure versus vocabulary. When you are given the verbs and adjectives, one can get confused on their usage in the language.Overall, a decent attempt to learn a language. If you are new to learning a language, it can be a decent start, but still recommend you take a class or find a book. Personally, I think the game helps more favoarbly with the Eastern langauges as you can match the writing with the words.			"

												This game accomplishes what it sets out to do, for the most part. I, however, purchased the Japanese version. Don't buy the Japanese version.Here's a simplified version of how the game works: Walk around a house and look at things. Learn how to read and speak these things. Increase your vocabulary for your language of choice. You'd be surprised just how many words you can learn by walking around an ordinary house pointing at things and saying ""What's that?""Here's the problem though; the house is the same in each language. So when you go into the Japanese version, for instance, and see...let's say a bed, you learn that a bed is called...a bed (technically bedo) in Japanese. So essentially you're just walking around a house learning how to pronounce things you already know with kana.Maybe further down the line they will release some DLC that provides a more personalized environment for each language; but as it stands, this is a big problem.Do I recommend it? Yes....if you are studying a language without many borrowed words/cognates. Don't get the Japanese version.			"

												While I really do like the concept, I really dislike the controls in this game. It mostly makes it such a pain to play it. And there's not much more that the character itself can DO, than walking. So I would have worked more on that part. [ Example: when I open a lower drawer by rightclicking on it, then walk towards it, the camera automatically swings back up. Even if I hold it down with the mousecursor, that has no effect at all. It gets so annoying, like when you are looking for clues in the tiny bathroom, you want to keep your ""head"" faced down to look, but as soon as you move, the camera swings back up! Why?? ].What else is really sad, is that there's just this one playmode you can use to learn the vocabulary. You could have done so much more with this concept. Sad, because it makes the game become boring very, very quickly. Which it shouldn't.[ Add more minigames, more playmodes to practice whole sentences for example. ]Also I agree with other reviewers, that adding an open world would greatly benefit the game. But that could come out as an addon anytime, so I'm fine with it for now.In general, the game has so much unused potential. If they worked on those things mentioned, it could become mega super awesome in the future. For now, I'll give it a 6/10 for the concept itself, the execution could have been better.			"

If you could leave your apartment and say, go to a market (numbers, money, simple conversations), that would be fantastic.This game really is a model for showing the potential of language-learning through first-person games, however, as a consumer be aware that this is not a complete product in that regard.  If the game were cheaper I would be more forgiving.  I do still recommend this game for people who have already begun learning this languages and want to test your knowledge of extremely practical vocabulary.  TL;DRMassive potential, needs more maps to really be worth the price.  Even without NPCs, there is great potential for other levels.  Having NPCs would make this game shine.			"

What you DO learn is an amount of 420 words (blaze it), an amount that surely will give you a little advantage but it won't give you much.

I also seem to be locked in the apartment and the door doesnt interact beyond telling me its a door so any vocabulary from the outside world is missing.

												I definitely recommend this for beginners. It's not full of grammar lessons or anything, but vocab. It's cool because you can discover words and memorize them by having to find them instead of typing everything out, filling in blanks, clicking a mouse. It's still clicking a mouse, but it tests your memory skill. I usually use the random vocab list option so I really have to run around. I don't really get the controls for the toy jet, but besides that, it's a cool concept. You can challenge yourself by changing the lesson settings (voice, vocab words, hints). Before this program, I used (and still use) Memrise, Duolingo, and Livemocha, but this is pretty cool compared to those less-interactive sources. One thing though. I practiced kana way before I even knew this game existed, so it'd be a little challenging for complete beginners. I suggest using Kana Invaders (a web app similar to Galaga, but with spelling kana). Also, if you want to practice typing kana, add hiragana and katakana to your platform/device's keyboard. It sounds like a roundabout way, but I'd be lying if I encouraged others to play the Japanese version and say it's pretty easy. It wouldn't be so easy for me if I didn't know how to read it before buying it. I don't know kanji that well, which is okay because you can switch the way you can read the vocab. The controls are a little complicated with navigation and clicking on stuff in FP, but it's fine as long as you take your time. I always play in third person to avoid giving myself a seizure from the camera sensitivity in FP. That's pretty much it.			"

												First off, when I found this game I was traveling soon so finding it was great timing and I put it to immediate (but limited) use and that gave it an immediate place on my shelf so I'm bias.  Second of all I am a firm believer in everything can be better, so in that light... Number 1 complaint ... no conversational (or useful in a trip or daily routine with people) language taught here.  It would be as easy as using the phone to call someone and having a conversation. A person to talk to would be fine, it would be fairly simple to be able to teach simple (and useful) phrases such as where is the restroom or where can we catch a cab, or what time do you want to meet or counting or anything you talk to someone about and not just a vocab list of items around ones home.   In a language game not learning the word for ""Hello"" I find it's uses very limited I find this to be a huge flaw and it almost keeps me from giving this game a thumbs up. Number 2 complaint ... there is a cat ... but as of yet no dog to be found. (there are a couple other instances of this that kind of bug me; water - no fire. lighter, ash tray, matches, - no cigarettes, tobacco pipe, weed, crack, or anything smokable)Number 3 ... things can be hard to select, I will have a pen for instance firmly in my sight and when in FPS mode the cross hairs are directly on it and when I zoom in it zooms in directly on the pen ... I click and I am wrong I can only suppose I clicked the desk its on.  that’s really my only major beef.  The other complaints I've read I can completely agree with is that it is VERY small 3 rooms and a bathroom. The main thing is that there is little to no conversational language to learn here which kind of saddens me, area's and idea's need to be able to be taught such as restroom.  I liked the idea I read in one review about adding people to talk to for conversatinoal learning and I think that would be perfect! But I really do love this game, I found myself fist pumping completed vocab lists, talking along as I walked around looking for what it was I needed to select, and countless other symptoms that would suggest I was getting into the game.  IDK if its better than Rosetta Stone, I've never tried it but I would still like too.  However at this price point and enjoyablility this is definitely a tool and a fun game.  I wouldn't recommend it as just a game or just using it to learn a language, but as a supplement to make learning fun I would give it 5/5.			"

												First off, when I found this game I was traveling soon so finding it was great timing and I put it to immediate (but limited) use and that gave it an immediate place on my shelf so I'm bias.  Second of all I am a firm believer in everything can be better, so in that light... Number 1 complaint ... no conversational (or useful in a trip or daily routine with people) language taught here.  It would be as easy as using the phone to call someone and having a conversation.

No, this goes a step further and only teaches you basic words, such as ""cup"", ""computer"" and ""table"".

												Really well done.  My only two issues:1) I must have missed the tutorial moment where they tell you to double click on objects when you're trying to complete a list.  Was really stuck for a while trying to figure out how time attacks worked when I couldn't get it to register what I was clicking.2) Still can't figure out how to add another language option.  I want to try French now, in addition to spanish.  The interface in Steam tells me I've already ""bought this"" generally, and I can't find a way inside the game to try and add a second language.  Haha, I'm just trying to give you guys more money :)Overall though, great ""game"", really polished and I definitely recommend it to people.			"

												If you want a kind of visual dictionary, I cannot recommend this version -which I play now, 2014-03-22- due to limit of word it has. Number of word were not that much and limit to objects which find in small apartsments. It's too samll.Without think about limit of number object, Idea is just awesome so if they update much more contents It could be much better and fun way to learn other language's word, especially childrens.So... Problem is this 'update', could they give us enought contents updates? or not? if they did, it could be a amazing game i've ever seen. but they didn't, this game is just enought for little childrens, not old one.Because of It's idea, I'll recommend this. not because it's number of contents is huge.

												Even on sale it was a complete waste of money. Like other reveiwers have said, it's basically a simple flashcard game by clicking on objects. No really difficult or obscure words, either-- not in the languages I already have some knowledge of, anyway.I got this despite the bad reviews because I saw a discussion on the forums about what they were going to add next-- because the tiny apartment is VERY limiting. If I was able to explore a bigger and more diverse world, I would actually probably give this game a solid rating and wouldn't have asked for a refund. -- Anyway, when I was really underwhelmed by the content currently available, I went back to that forum post to see if they were going to add anything new any time soon --- and realised the discussion had happened several years ago. They probably aren't going to add anything else. If you want to practice a language (after getting basic skills from pretty much ANYTHING ELSE), a good way to practice languages is use those language options in your game. A lot of games on Steam have quite a few language compatabilities-- will full audio and subtitles oftentimes. It'll tell you generally what it supports on a game's store page.But no, for real, to keep up with my Italian, I just play games in Italian. All the Bioshock games have a REALLY solid Italian language version-- with proper colloquialisms and everything! The Metro games have a really solid Russian language option. Anyway, just keep an eye out. Most BIG titles will have some language options-- and ones developed not in a primarily English speaking place usually have the options of those areas. The Talos Principle for example has a LOT of slavic language options, most notably to me, Croatian. <3 But yeah, basic knowledge (be at least conversational, I guess?) is required to be able to practice well with it. But there are a lot of ways to do that. -- And those ways would NOT be by playing this game. It does not prepare you for anything except knowing what a few houshold objects are called. I would recommend podcasts, youtube, finding friends who want to learn english and you want to learn their language and just talking back and forth, etc.			"

												You take the role of an unfortunate young man unable to leave his apartment, seemingly stuck in time. The only other living things with him being his cat who never wakes from her slumber, and a few plants, one of which is neglected through lack of watering. A quick look at the clock in the kitchen reveals that time stands still. It becomes apparent that you're stuck in some sort of time loop, or that time has somehow frozen. The outside tempts you through pictures of the protagonist and a young woman whom I assume is his girlfriend. Various posters and books strewn around tease the existence of a world outside. Forms of communication like your computer and television do nothing. The television looping the same video over and over, the ""portatil"" and ""ordenador"" stuck on the same webpage, a phamplet pushed through a mail slot...it's all a reminder to his predicament.    Stuck, the young man does what any sane person would do. Learn a new language. There are 420 words to be learned, and you must help him learn them. Lindo, Techo, Muro, he learns these new words. Portatil, pelota; the man keeps going. You know its all futile in the end, but you must keep going. I'm about 100 words away from 420 (great reference there BTW), but I fear I might think ""now what..."" when I get there.     There's a silver lining to all this for you the player. In alternate versions, you learn new words like: ""cama"", ""寝床"", and ""lit."" Words you can use with the beautiful women of this world (warning: you might get slapped). That said, this is a WONDERFUL language reference in my opinion. Team it up with a good education, the ""Duolingo"" app, or a nice girlfriend (or bf, or both) if you're into multicultrual dating. It's a great supplement to your language learning arsenal. I try to keep my PC library efficent by getting rid of games I've finished, and files I don't need any longer. But this ""game"" Influent...It's going to stay on my hardrive for a loong time.      My version is Spanish, and any additional version is USD 4,99. Unless you're Jason Bourne, a linguistic professor, or a robot, I would not recommend buying more than a few in a short time span. The price tag of USD 9.99 is very well worth it IMHO. A good tip to help out: change UI language settings to whichever one you're trying to learn.			"

												The first few words of the product description are ""Influent is a Language Learning Game.."" which apparently, it is not.Case in point: I wanted to try learn Japanese, and there was a special offer a long time ago so I didn't have to pay much to get the game, so I figured I would give it a shot and try learn some Japanese.  You are placed into a room, walking around and clicking on things, 'collecting words'.  Apparently at some point they test you on these words, but they don't show you HOW to learn a word!  This game is basically a test to see if you are good enough to continue learning new words, but if you don't know how to speak the language at all, this is useless.If I got the German or French version I would probably have a different opinion (and I might get those versions at some point because they seem more useful to me) since they use 'english/latin' characters I am familiar with.  I can see the text ""der film"" and figure out that it is a movie, and I can say that word and learn by saying it and memorizing it.  The Japanese version though is not for me.  I click on something and a bunch of Japanese letters pop up on the screen.  How do I read this language without any training?  I literally need to go elsewhere, learn the entire language, and then start to play Influent to learn a few extra words.  Also, they have a voice actor speak the words as I click on things.  While that may seem helpful, it isn't.  It just sounds like randomness.  However, instead of showing me that 'movie' is '映画', it should also say the english phonetically compatible version of 'Eiga', which would be infinitely more useful but still doesn't help in showing me why 'Eiga' is '映画', but it would be a good start.  So basically this software is only an accessory to someone who knows mostly everything and wants to sharpen their skills a little bit, but don't expect to learn a lot by using it.			"

												Having lived in China for 8 years, as of writing this, and having never actually formally studied Chinese, this ""game"" helps in two ways.First, it helps fill in some really rudimentary gaps in my vocabulary.Second, it helps to reinforce some of the vocabulary I've heard but not cemented in my mind.When it comes to learning a language, however, it is the person's attitude that makes the real difference. This means any tool is only as effective as the driver behind it.All the same, I'd recommend this application to anyone who would like to fill their head with some words in another language. As a game, it's not altogether fun, but it's certainly better than the alternative of trying to learn from a dictionary of random words.			"

It's hard to make out what he says from time to time.It's a nice app to go along an actual language cursus but the quality of the language displayed is not always very good.P.S.:How often exactly do we need to use the word ""skateboard"" in any given language?

We bought it to practice Japanese, but the only thing it even offers is a very limited vocabulary learning game that centers entirely around objects in a home.You will not learn to speak a single sentence in Japanese.  Not even to say 'yes' or 'no'.  You will not, at all, learn Japanese.  In fact, many of the words you do learn will mean something else entirely when not in the proper context, so even the vocabulary you pick up is of limited use.I still do like it.  As a vocab trainer, it's pretty cool.  It needs a lot more depth and it needs to be honest about what it is, but on sale it's worth a buy.13 out of 19 muffins.			"

												im learning spanish so far, i'm entertained for an hour or two almost every 2 days or so, and really the results are great. I just started working at a pawn shop and i dont know spanish that well and now im learning all these objects and bam the sentences come later like when you gotta use ""de"" or ""los"" ""el"", or anything else that has to do with connecting sentences, but the whole point is, is that if you don't know jack of spanish and you need a quick way out to learn what some objects are called. This my friends is the beginning to spanish. This is going back to the basics if you were a child and you didn't know anything of spanish this is the way to go. i highly recommend it.			"

												A very simple but effective system. Enjoyable, too. The game is perfect for a quick little practice in a five minute break or an extended session. Sometimes the controls can be a bit fiddly, causing you to select the wrong item in time attacks. The only real downsides are the slightly unclear nature of some adjectives and verbs and the small size of the world. I hope that an expansion or sequel will include objects found outside the home.A definite recommendation, though don't expect perfection.			"

												Very good software if you want to learn new words (Mainly everyday objects + some adjectives & verbs)I'd say it's worth its price because playing and replaying the time trial mode really helped me to learn the words faster than with a book or a regular learning software, it's entertaining and effective.Beware: It doesn't touch the grammar, you may want to learn the basics somewhere else first (online or irl courses, ""real"" language learning software), then purchase this as a ""supplement"".PS: New languages coming soon, check out the forum!

												This game definitely has a lot of potential. If you're looking for a basic vocabulary game, it's pretty good. I'm hoping the developer continues adding content [as there's a pretty limited list of vocab]. Take note, as of right now, if the language you're planning on buying had feminine/masculine properties to the words, those arent included. There's a few verbs and adjectives as well. Considering the developer has done tons of the work load by himself, it's a pretty impressive game. Give it time.			"

												It's a good vocabulary learning tool, but it won't teach you a new language. Vocabulary is clay, but possessing clay does not make you a sculptor. If you want to learn a language, this is a great first step. I bought the French pack, and I've ""mastered"" in game terms 50% of the content in two sessions of playing. But the game only aims to teach you 420 words, which is a very basic vocabulary. The average adult has a vocabulary of 12,000-17,000 words. Furthermore, the game teaches you no grammar. You might know what Yogurt or door mat is after beating a language set, but you won't be able to build a coherent sentence. That's okay. Influent offers a very limited scope, but what it does offer it does rather well. If you are interested in taking the first few steps to learning a language, buy this game. It's worth the $10.			"

As a matter of fact, you don't even feel like learning, more like quizzing, but still. You're learning.If you like foreign languages and if you would like to do more than just play games on Steam; try this.Influent puts the fun back in to language learning, just as with ""Genki Japan"".I don't think that Influent is the only thing you need to learn a new language, and I speak 4 languages,  but it does help alot to get started.

												An interesting and unique approach to learning another language.While a bit cluttered and confusing the moment you jump in, Influent has alot to offer in terms of Edutainment and helps pave the way for other educational titles. What stood out the most to me was the ability within the game to actually choose from a bank of words lying around the typical home, rather than have the game set those words for you. By enabling the user to decides their own words (and which adjectives and verbs to tack on) Influent allows them to study at whatever pace they'd like, and focus on whichever areas they desire. Whether it be trying to figure out the masculine/feminine states of certain pieces of furniture, or memorizing the different parts of a bed, Influent has got you covered.For 10 bucks, it's a definate buy.

												Bought the French pack. Seems pretty cool so far, though I've only spent about a half hour in this. You interact with things in your environment and learn their names in your chosen language, and when you've picked up enough words, you can review them in minigames.I'm not sure I'd recommend this to a total beginner to French. This might be something that comes up later in the game, but I was confused to see that the game omits the proper gender articles for a given word. For instance, the word for ""book"" is ""livre"", which the game tells you is ""masculine"". That's correct, but then the game doesn't tell you what that means.The minigames could use a little bit of work. Time Attack was my favorite one, where you're given a word and you have to run around and find the object the word corresponds to. So if you're given ""mur"", you have to go and double click on a ""wall"". It's easy enough, but things get stressful when you have to click very precisely on a really small or skinny object and you're trying to do it as fast as possible to get a good score. I wish the hitboxes had been bigger on these objects, because even if I turn up mouse sensitivity, a stylo is SO MUCH SMALLER than the bureau, and it can be a pain getting my cursors to line up with a tiny object. The sluggish walk controls don't help much either.The other minigame I tried out let you take control of a model plane and zoom around the room shooting objects that match up to a given word. Thing is, you have to shoot several times at an object (presumably to tell the game you REALLY, REALLY, REALLY do know the meaning of that word, even though the repetition isn't a feature of the other minigame) and your plane is constantly moving towards whatever point in space you're focusing on. This means that you have to sometimes turn around to get more breathing room to fire on the object until the game finally tells you you're correct, and THIS is an issue because the plane controls rather sluggishly, and also explodes upon touching just about anything.Still, it was a good refresher for some vocabulary I'd forgotten. I could see this being useful as a side tool for a more in-depth language course.			"

												I've noticed many negative reviews about the game with the expectation it will teach you the language you're learning, but this is more like an interactive tool to increase vocabulary and association. You explore the house and find many things, which you then get tested on. You can do casual or timed exams depending on how adventurous you're feeling. I dislike that you have to unlock the words before being able to study them, but other than that it's a great addition for anyone looking for an additional means for their studies. If the regular price is too much, then definitely pick this up when it's on sale. You won't regret it!			"

												From the hour that I've played, i'm able to recommend this game as a suppliment to your learning.This game primarily teaches nouns, with some verbs and adjectives on the side. This means that it does NOT teach grammar. I see this game as a suppliment to your normal learning. The primary game is to pick out some words you want to learn by clicking the object and pressing space. Afterwards you get to play a 'time attack' game where you're told the word and must go around the house trying to find it, or an example of it.Some problems I find are that some objects in some places are hard to click while in first person mode, e.g. eggs or butter. The game also has only one looping song, and although it's rather nice I can see it getting boring after a while. The game space may also seem very small and crowded, especially in 3rd person. You are also only able to time attack 10 words at a time.You'll want to note that when you buy the game, you'll essentially be given one of the DLC for free to start out with.			"

												The game has it's ups and downs. It is quite fun when you get into it, but it's set up is somewhat confusing. It also has this annoying thing that when you're in TIME ATTACK, one of the gams levels for vocab you can do, the cursor will automaticly zoom in when you are looking at something, and will often make you click on the wrong thing. Even though this does happen, it still has helped me out ALOT with my german. I would recommend this game to people who are really struggling with their german, like I was, but now, I'm much better an putting in words for sentices, learning how to say/pernounce certain sentinces, and much more!

												Fun little immersive 'quiz' that can help you memorise vocabulary.I see lots of people criticising saying it won't actually teach you the language - well, no, I don't think it was designed for that. Check out the price tag on Rosetta Stone if you want to see what that would cost you. What it is made to do, it does well. By avoiding any grammar at all, and focusing entirely on vocabulary, it is probably in the end better at its goals.Sure, being a beginner and learning the Korean for houseplant might not seem useful, but when you've actually picked some up and want to start 'decorating' your sentences with nouns, that is where this shines. I think too many people were somehow expecting to learn a full language from a cheap-as-chips game.What this does is give me a great alternative to sitting down with mind-numbing flashcards and let me learn in a much more engaging way, and that is all I wanted from this.If I had a couple of criticisms it would be the amount of content and a technical issue. For the content, perhaps the environment could be expanded somewhat (can I at least look down the corridor and find the word for 'elevator'? And the technical issue I've had is that, somewhat bizarrely, the game saves your progress in the Windows registry. This means if you move computer or reinstall windows or something, there are no save game files to copy to the new computer, even if you've made a backup.			"

												The first thing you need to know about this is that, despite being called ""the language learning game"", this cannot be used to learn a language to any degree. Don't expect something like Duolingo or Rosetta Stone, which if you don't know are interactive applications which, if used regularly, will essentially provide a sufficiently structured learning plan to allow you to become functionally proficient (IE, able to carry on a simple conversation) in another language.All this game allows you to do is learn basic vocabulary. That's it. You walk around inside a little apartment and click on objects, and the game tells you the name of the object in the language you've chosen, frequently alongside relevant adjectives and verbs (EG, clicking on a candle will tell you the word for ""candle"" as well as the word for the verb ""light""). Then you can create vocabulary lists that will allow you to test your knowledge of these words. It's very good for that, for learning some basic vocabulary in a new language. But it will not do anything else. It won't teach you any sort of grammar; you won't so much as learn how to put together a sentence properly in the subject language. But if you're just learning the basics of a new language, or would like to, then this is good for that. It will help you quickly master a basic vocabulary list which will help you start listening to dialogue or reading or taking a class or doing any of the other things that will help you actually learn a new language.

												I barely had to play this game before I realized I may have made a mistake in buying it. ""Influent"" is not a language learning tool that would work for most people. It's good for refreshing your memory on a language you have already learned, just to practice, but I can't see how this game would actually TEACH you to speak anotherlanguage. I would reccomend playing ""Influent"" alongside either a language course or another more in-depth game for language speaking.			"

												I wanted a language I already knew (Russian) but wanted to brush up on it. I wanted to learn to play the game, but not fight with the language to learn what to do with the game. So I have played this game with Russian many times, and have slowly gotten better with the words I either forgot or didn't know. I really recommend this game, BUT it's a bit tricky. Is it tellling you the color of the item, the size, what it is, what it's for. Because of knowing the language, it has confused me several times. The word does not tell you the context of the word, even with the translation option. In other languages, there can be other meanings to a word that are not what you expected from that item. But one thing is for sure, some of it is funny. I see a word translated, and it's correct and proper, BUT to hear a Russian say the same word for the same item is sometimes weird and funny.  Remember, immersion is the key to learning a language, not translating. I RECOMMEND THIS.			"

												I've been using Influent to learn Mandarin, and it has been one of the most helpful vocabulary tools I have found. It provides a very clear UI for gamification (although the controls are wonky) and reads words out loud, which is super important trying to learn a tonal language, coming from English. It is a little disappointing with the limited environment, although that environment does contain a massive amount of objects, so it's less of a problem then it could be, and I respect the developer increasing the breadth of languages rather than the depth of each.  I would reccomend looking at this game after looking at other free or cheap language learning tools. It may be you will find one that works very well for you and you won't need to spend money on this game. However, very few free Mandarin sites provided me with the pronunciations I wanted, and the gamification here makes me feel very intensely about wanting to get a random list of 10 words correct.			"

												Influent is a great way to get a very basic vocabulary (though sadly no grammar). At around 400 words it is nearly comparable to an entry level language course. Or perhaps better put a great complement to en entry level course.The only mayor con as of yet is the rather limited world of Andrews apartment. Making DLC with other scenery and/or listening comprehension segments would greatly improve the experience.			"

												This is fun and cute. I got the Japanese one. I would not suggest it if you haven't taken at least an introductory course. I like this because it makes it easier for me to remember a lot of common words. There are a few too many loan words for my taste but not enough for me to not suggest it. It's not really language learning software. It's basically glorified flash cards. It also splits up the pronunciation so you can see which kanji is read in what way in compound spellings. Basically if you want a cute way to remember a lot of every day objects this is great. If you want to get better at recognizing the kanji for every day objects it's great. If you don't already know how to read kana or are not currently learning them separately don't buy this game for Japanese.			"

I don't recommend this game to everyone. You should be motivated to learn the given language.This game is good at what the developers focussed on. You get dropped into a room and can see what the object is called in the chosen language. However there is no real structure in your approach. You roam the room and add arbitrary words to your list. There is an airplane minigame which to my opinion is totally out of context. And although it is mentioned, the game doesn't focus on sentences. Just vocabulary. However I would have prefered some better testing modes instead of the airplane mode (which is essentially ""time attack"" from an airplane).Pros:- Clear UI- Easy controls- intuitive word listing- good time attack- rich amount of objects- time attack and random words are good testing methodsCons:- Missing variety in testing methodes- out-of-context airplane game mode- no sentence support- no structured approach of learning			"

												Having studied Japanese during my Uni years and now living in Korea, this take on ""fun"" learning is enjoyable for refreshing and reinforcing previous knowledge. Yes it is limited to only 420 nouns, adj, and verbs, and limited to only 4 rooms in the house, I think it has a lot of potential if the developer expands upon it.Although Japanese and Korean have a lot of borrowed words from English in the game (as previous reviews have complained about), they are used in the language as well, so knowing what is a borrowed word is useful.I wasn't a fan of the flying plane mode as it was a pain to try to focus on smaller objects throughout the house like pens/pencils etc. but a cool concept.The music was relaxing and enjoyable while searching for objects.I look forward to the future prospects of this product, because... genuinely, whatever motivates you to learn a language will get you one step closer to using it and fluency.**On a side note, Achievements took roughly 7 hours for me to complete with a little knowledge in the language I was playing in.**			"

												TL:DR summary:This game is not fun and won't help you learn a language.I'm interested in language learning and so I was really excited to try this ""game"" and see what it brings to the table. I knew about that game for a long time, but with the recent humble bundle, I spent a buck to find out. This is what I think:- I can hardly call this a game. While I really like the ""intro-story"", the game doesn't build up on the story at all. The whole ""game"" consists of you running around in your flat and clicking things. Your character isn't talking at all and the only objectives are getting the achievements and/or completing an ingame todo list, which groups certain words thematically. While the latter kept me motivated for a while, but also got me frustrated, since the list contains the ""to be learned""-words in target language. So you have no real clue what to look for- You only learn vocabulary. While I'm not a big fan of grammar rules in the form of equations or conjugation tables, this game doesn't contain a single sentence! Only words! Mainly nouns, but later on adjectives and verbs as well. But no sentences!- You don't really learn any vocabulary. I have to major issues. First, the game tells you that you ""mastered"" a word after several successful training units. However the game doesn't contain any concept about long-term memory. After you learn words in a language, you have to repeat them in growing intervals. Repeat after 1 minute, 15 minutes, an hour, 5 hours, a day, 5 days, a month and so on... this game thinks you ""mastered"" a word in 3 min. That is not how memory works :( Second: The way the game teaches you is: it shows or tells you a word and you have to find the corresponding object in your flat and click it. However this only builds your passive vocabulary. If you were given a word in your mother tongue and you should translate it to the language you are learning, this game won't really help youSo all in all the ""TL:DR summary"" is very black and white (in this case black). This software gives you some motivation to learn/repeat words and you might indeed learn a thing or two. If you are just planning to fool around with some vocabulary of a language and spend 2 or 3 hours, this game is fine. For anything else it is really ill fitted. You definetely won't learn a language and I can hardly believe that anyone will build a real vocabulary with this. Rather pick up memrise.com courses or get anki for vocab training,			"

												This game is a really clever and charming tool for basic vocabulary. There's  not conversation or grammar included, and the words are all pretty 'Unit 1,' but at $10 for the base game plus one language pack, and $5 each per language pack, the price is right. Are you going to achieve fluency in any given language with this game? No. Will you achieve fluency in any language for ten dollars? Probably not, but if you find a way please let me know.TL;DR: Good vocab tool to supplement other, more intense, language learning programs. Inexpensive and charming.			"

												Excellent for learning hotel languages. While it won't help you with grammar and formulating sentences (head to duolingo for that, which is free), helping you memorize 420 vocabulary words with a video game is pretty great. It'll get you started and keep you interested as opposed to trying to learn from scratch with websites. With those, the second you get burnt out, you're more likely to quit and put it off for some unknown future date. But if you're playing a game that consists of learning what's in your house, it's hard not to continue reminding yourself of the words. Hell, I've caught myself going to il frigorifero at night for uno spuntino. If it's on sale, get it.			"

Whilst I wouldn't recommend relying solely on this program to learn a specific language, it's a great way to broaden one's vocabulary of everyday words.

It allows you to learn in your own time, which is great for both those who want to go on an intensive learning spree or those who don't have the time to do too much.			"

I'm playing the Russian language version and have not even found explanations of the Cryllic alphabet. A bit disappointed but the pronounciation of each word found helps a lot!

I already know some, and this is helping me fill all kinds of absurd holes in my knowledge (I didn't even know that I didn't know how to say ""mayo"" or ""clingwrap"" or ""blender"" etc.)It's not comprehensive, and it won't teach you sentence structure.  For the folks using it to learn Japanese, of course it's going to teach you lots of cognates; that's kind of how Japanese works.  For helping cement and strengthen someone who is already at the strong beginner level in a language, though, it's a very useful and engaging toy....and at this price, it's cheaper and more fun than any language learning toy I've seen.

												For learning vocabulary this game is very good but you need to be aware of its limitations:- You are searching for words in a flat. Everything that can reasonably be in a flat is in it. Most of those are really everyday-vocabulary that is useful to know but you also get things like 'coat rack' which might not be something you need in your early everyday-conversations. On the other hand e.g. stuff like 'car' or most animal are missing. Still I'd say that overall the large majority is really useful vocabulary- if you're practising nouns it's obvious how it works: it asks for table and you click on the table but adjectives and verbs it's different: you get them via nouns that have a connection with them. A plant grows, you wash laundry etc. That can get difficult when there is more than one association you can make. A poster might be beautiful but in this game it's only associated with a painting...- you can either practise a list of 10 words that you made or a random list of 10 words. There is no possibility to limit this random list to just those you don't know well, yet. I know that Russian 'banan' means 'banana' by now. I don't need to go over at again and again. A possibility to stop asking for vocabulary you have already mastered would have been nice.For me those are only minor issues and I still think it's a great vocabulary-game.			"

												It's a nice little vocab builder. All 420 words in the game are moderately useful for day-to-day life. If you were expecting a robust language software, or even something that would let you string a sentence together, this isn't it. But it gamifies learning some useful vocab and it good for getting a feel of the language's phonetics. The only thing I think is lacking )(that I would expect for software this price) is a simple game/tool for other alphabets and the sign/sound correspondences of them. If you're looking at getting a language pack with non-Latin alphabet (e.g. Japanese, Russian), I would suggest learning the alphabet seperately before playing. There are much better free websites (e.g. Memrise) that teach orthography and letter sounds much better than this software.If you want to be fluent, move to another country. If you want to learn a lot about a language, get an expensive software like Rosetta stone. If you want to impress your friends with a few vocab items and learn something while playing seek and find, get Influent.			"

												The game initially was a fun to start learning a language. It's very similar to learning from flash cards but it includes verbal cues. My main problem with the game is with its terrible word list system. You select objects and add them to your vocabulary list. The list is broken up into groups of 10 words. To learn the words you must pick a list of 10 and test yourself on it. Organizing words in these lists is a nightmare since you can only swap 2 words at a time. With 400+ words in the game this becomes nearly impossible to organize. Also, you can't remove words you've added to your list or even move them to a ""learn later"" section.			"

It does not offer an entire language course,but rather the basics anyone should know in the target language ur learning. So if u got the buck,this is a great buy.			"

One thing though - when doing a time attack often times you will click on the right answer (In my case inteligen on the computer) and get the same object wrong the next time you click it (ordinatrum means computer) in the same time attack.  I recommend not having same objects in a word list.			"

												This is fun and cute. I got the Japanese one. I would not suggest it if you haven't taken at least an introductory course. I like this because it makes it easier for me to remember a lot of common words. There are a few too many loan words for my taste but not enough for me to not suggest it. It's not really language learning software. It's basically glorified flash cards. It also splits up the pronunciation so you can see which kanji is read in what way in compound spellings. Basically if you want a cute way to remember a lot of every day objects this is great. If you want to get better at recognizing the kanji for every day objects it's great. If you don't already know how to read kana or are not currently learning them separately don't buy this game for Japanese.			"

I don't recommend this game to everyone. You should be motivated to learn the given language.This game is good at what the developers focussed on. You get dropped into a room and can see what the object is called in the chosen language. However there is no real structure in your approach. You roam the room and add arbitrary words to your list. There is an airplane minigame which to my opinion is totally out of context. And although it is mentioned, the game doesn't focus on sentences. Just vocabulary. However I would have prefered some better testing modes instead of the airplane mode (which is essentially ""time attack"" from an airplane).Pros:- Clear UI- Easy controls- intuitive word listing- good time attack- rich amount of objects- time attack and random words are good testing methodsCons:- Missing variety in testing methodes- out-of-context airplane game mode- no sentence support- no structured approach of learning			"

												This is a really great concept. The gameplay is really simple and easy to get an understanding of. The camera can be a little clunky at times, however. Now, as a language learning device, it needs some work. Learning what words are in other languages is a big part of it, but you need to also be using sentences, not just words.I would give this a 8/10. It's definately worth picking up if you are looking into learning a language that this game is in.			"

												Functionally equivalent to flash cards. Lacking some basic usability features, interface can be a little cumbersome and doesn't control well in first person. Word mastery feels arbitrary. Vocab limited to your 4-room apartment as well so some of the words are a little specialist. Reverse translation would be very helpful but is conspicuously absent. Plenty of room for this game to improve but will probably never be more than a fun supplement to learning a new language. You will get out of it as much as you put in, just as with any language tool.			"

												I received this game through a recent Humble Bundle and it's been a pleasant surprise.  I'm not certain if I made a mistake when it was purchased...but when it first started up, English was the only selection.  I did not have an option of choosing which languange I'd like to learn.  I went ahead and purchsed two language packs and have been progressing quickly.The game will get you to understand many items you'd find around the house, but I'd like to see the development of an outside/office/public area.  Also, other mini-games involving potential sentance structure would be great. One last nit-pick:  The random word list is fantastic...but as I'm adding more words to the list, I'd really like to focus more on the newer words rather than a truely random selection.  I've been getting the first 20 words that I've mastered repeatedly, even as I move onward to 150-200 words listed.It's worth picking up, rather fun, but has significant room for growth!			"

												This is not a learning tool. It's a fetch quest generator in disguise.You point to objects in the room and add them to the list, then you need to find these objects from the list of 10. Imagine running through the room from fridge to sofa to the baseball under the bed. In case this might be boring, there's another mode this game provides: you're a miniature plane, you fly (pretty fast) and shoot same objects from the same list.Thus, by tens you 'learn' the words. But you're no caveman - you find an object three times in a row, you learn it. That's it, it will never fade from your memory. Well done. 420 words is all you need anyway.There are better (and free) ways to expand your vocabulary and learn the language in general. Look up Duolingo or Memrise, to name a couple.			"

												So I have the Chinese and Spanish.For The game in general, The way it work is that you are in an apartment you get to explore. You  the ability to switch between third person and first person, and the bases of the game is that you click on objects, the game pronounces the word, the transation and shows the word. you then have the choice to add the word to your vocab list. This applies for nouns and verbs with the verbs being attached to an object that is related to the verb ( for example, the verb ""To watch"" is attached to the Television). for every ten words you select to add, a new list consisting of just those words in made, and then you are able to test yourself on the list. the test works  be you get the option to isolate how much of the word you get in order find the object (For example, you can choice to have just the word appear with no voice or clues to the direction of the object, or you can just pick to hear the voice and no text to aid you).You progress in the game by testing youself on these words you obtain, and then successfully picking any word three times in a row. once you do that, you receive a gold star ( which is used to buy verbs and adjectives off of objects) and the word is considered mastered. you beat the game by mastering all the words of all the objects in the apartment.For any langauge, this game is a perfect way to improve your ear for the langauge and to better introduce yourself with more vocabulary.now to the langaugesThe Chinese is nice, it has a selection to do pinyin and later characters. The tones for each word is clear, the speaker is very good at what it's doing. The problem is that you often will recieve a word with synonyms, which happens in each language, but with Mandarin chinese being so regional, the game doesn't explain which words are used where (Such as tailand or main land china.)Spanish is great, the pronounciations are clear, with the speaker leaning towards a latin american accent. the langauge is standard, with the words you receive being the most understood word, with synonyms being out shined by this standard words. again, a problem is that the game doesnt explain which words are used where, but I guess you can google it or something. not much more to say,Not a good game to learn a langauge's grammer,a great game for people with an understanding of a language's grammer that want to expand thier vocab.

												You can tell by my hours played that I didn't play this game that long. This isn't just because I didn't want to play anymore, but because I was skeptical that I'd further my education by doing so.To begin with, the game environment is uncomfortable. You're confined to an extremely small apartment, with 400 objects you can learn to say in one of twelve languages. The amount of stuff cramped into such a tiny area makes it feel even more claustrophobic than it would as just an unfurnished area, which makes me feel like shutting off the game right from the beginning. This is especially true if you're playing in third person, which means your character model is added to it all. I don't know much about what can and can't be patched, but I'd like to suggest to the dev if it's possible to edit the map so that the 3 rooms are at least a few feet wider, and have some of the furniture spaced out a bit as well.The actual objects themselves aren't very fun to look at either (except for the Cowboy Bebop reference in one of the posters!). Everything is completely static, and the only interaction available with them is to find out the word for them in your chosen language. This might seem like all that you'd need, but with the actual quizzing being so basic, it makes things really boring when you literally can do nothing else. It'd be cool if some objects had animations (especially the doors, which I desperately wanted to open for some more space), or even physics that let you drag them around.One small complaint to add before moving on to my biggest one: while the one track available is actually very enjoyable, there needs to be more songs added. I think I'd go crazy if I had to listen to that same song over and over for more than an hour.Now my biggest problem of all isn't really relevant for people who aren't learning Japanese: There's no focus on the Kanji. In the Japanese language, Kanji is /VERY/ crucial to being able to read or write anything. Yes, it is included in the game, but there's nothing to help you remember the details of it, let alone the stroke order for writing it. Without that, it's fairly pointless to play the game at all for anything besides listening practice, but even for that you'd be better off watching anime and/or Japanese films, and listening to Japanese music and podcasts.For vocabularly, I personally would suggest downloading a free language learning program called ""Anki"", and then dowloading (also free) both the Heisig Kanji card pack, and the Japanese Core 2k pack. Some untranslated mangas are decent practice as well.The developer for this game obviously had great intentions, and on paper his concept is great. But in execution, not so much.			"

												It should be noted firstly that Influent is a vocabulary expansion tool, not a language learning tool. It boasts the ability to teach up to 420 words in whichever language you choose. Yes, you could find all of the words online, but Influent has the element of interactivity. It is unbelievably convenient and useful to be able to actually see the things related to what you are learning. There is a very noticeable and evident difference between learning a word and (perhaps) seeing a picture, and learning a word in an interactive space. Seeing a word in an interactive space makes, truly, all the difference.     The downsides to the game include a limited gameplay space, and thus limited word choice. A certain 'word bias', I suppose (there is a cat, but no dog, and a cactus but no flower, for example). It would be greatly appreciated if, later on, there was some world expansion DLC that included a new place to explore --- if the developers are reading this, I'm recommending a small store or shop, that would be nice.    Overall, it is certainly a good game, and it is worth CAD 10.99. I would recommend this game to people who have learned or are learning the grammar to their chosen language and who are looking to expand their vocabulary.			"

												I got the spanish pack with the Humble Bundle.I've gotten to about 170 words so far. Pretty enjoyable pace. You have the option of hearing a word as well as reading, or you can disanle one and use the other. The real game side of things is the ten question quiz, which has you going around via walking or flying a space ship toy and finding the objects it names (or another word attached to said object). Having never taken a Spanish class the thing I found so surprising is that plenty of words are so similar!The word for newspaper sounds like periodical. The word for spatula is espatula. The word for skateboard is skateboard, the word for CD is CD. The word for poster is poster.  THE WORD FOR SANDWICH IS SANDWICH! It really blew my mind.A window sounds like a vent (ventana). So many words that are easy to pick up because they sound similar. It's great! If I had to make a complaint, it's that not all the audio recordings are very clear (MOST OF THEM ARE) so there's a few words where is feels like they started recording a quarter second too late: a V will sound like a B,  an R will sound like a D. Some suffer noise pollution: ruedecilla (stove knob) for example has an odd beep in front of it. But on the whole, the game is worth getting. It's a pretty entertaining approach and I think I'll spend some more time on it.			"

												This game is centered around learning vocabulary and that is it.  Gameplay centers around exploration of your limited environment in order to pick out objects that you come across.  It then gives fun little quizzes that ask you to find the objects in your environment.  For its intended task, it is great and works well.  Influent's only downfall is that everything you learn will be individualized nouns.  From my experience, it does not introduce verbs, sentence structure, etc.  If someone goes into the game thinking it will be a full language course, then they will be dissappointed.  If they go in looking at Influent from the perspective of a fun tool to help master some common objects, they will be very happy with their purchase.I can't wait to see how the game evolves.  I can see the game expanding into explorations outside of the small aparment and into the world with further exploration of items.  Then expanding further to have the user build sentences to interact with the environment or even order food at restaurants.  If the developer takes it that far, they will be in a full league/class of their own for interactive linguistic education.  Great start to a product with loads of oppurtunity to expand.			"

												I've been using Influent to learn Mandarin, and it has been one of the most helpful vocabulary tools I have found. It provides a very clear UI for gamification (although the controls are wonky) and reads words out loud, which is super important trying to learn a tonal language, coming from English. It is a little disappointing with the limited environment, although that environment does contain a massive amount of objects, so it's less of a problem then it could be, and I respect the developer increasing the breadth of languages rather than the depth of each.  I would reccomend looking at this game after looking at other free or cheap language learning tools. It may be you will find one that works very well for you and you won't need to spend money on this game. However, very few free Mandarin sites provided me with the pronunciations I wanted, and the gamification here makes me feel very intensely about wanting to get a random list of 10 words correct.			"

												To clear up any confusion, Influent is not ""a Language Learning Game focusing primarily on vocabulary"". It is purely a vocabulary builder and nothing else.Having said that, it is the best example of turning the boring task of vocabulary memorisation into a game that I have seen. I have ""mastered"" over 400 words and it was actually *fun* to do so, which is something I can't say for books or flashcards. Assigning the words to virtual objects has really helped me remember them. The testing method involves hunting down items that belong to lists of 10 words at a time. It's quite limited in this regard but it's not bad.I'm using the Norwegian DLC so can't comment on the accuracy of other languages, but I have found one incorrect word so be sure to check against a dictionary when learning / playing.

												This is a fantastic game for anyone who is LEARNING a language and wants to build upon it. Do not buy this if you're looking to become magically fluent in a language. This works well in congunction with Duolingo (google it.) Also the first person mode kind of made me dizzy. But overall it's great.			"

												As far as I can tell the game, while not being the most comprehensive language learning program I've ever used it does do a great job at expanding your vocabulary in a chosen language. But keep it to that, when it comes to learning proper syntac, or even sentence structure then use something else. Overall, great game, and fairly enjoyable if frustrating speed.			"

												This game is perfect for taking your very first steps in the vocabulary of your target language. There are only about 500 words though, so if you're looking to master a language you should look elsewhere.The game is fun though. With colors that are vibrant and pleasing to the eye and honestly quite addictive. ""Just 10 more words"" is something that I frequently think after finishing a set.I hope they add more learning environments in the future to expand the vocabulary. Would definitely buy the DLC if they did.			"

												Excellent for learning hotel languages. While it won't help you with grammar and formulating sentences (head to duolingo for that, which is free), helping you memorize 420 vocabulary words with a video game is pretty great. It'll get you started and keep you interested as opposed to trying to learn from scratch with websites. With those, the second you get burnt out, you're more likely to quit and put it off for some unknown future date. But if you're playing a game that consists of learning what's in your house, it's hard not to continue reminding yourself of the words. Hell, I've caught myself going to il frigorifero at night for uno spuntino. If it's on sale, get it.			"

												Influent is an interesting little game that could use a little work. I'm impressed that there's a Latin version, which is what I bought. I've studied Latin for years yet never learned any neo-latin words (as many modern household items don't have names in classical latin). Gameplay is simple: click on an object and see/hear the translation. However I wish the game also displayed the name of the item alongside the translated name, as many of the Latin names for items end up being noun - adjective combinations. Doube clicking on an object provides a little extra info, but for Latin it's really only the gender of the noun. Including the principal parts or declension could really improve the usefulness of this tool.  "

												I chosen japanese (probably, like most of you). This is an advise to those who are thinking about buying the game:1)Would you like learning a language? (This is not a real game, it can be fun but this is a way to study)2) Can you learn how to write (for example) in pages like this? http://www.tanoshiijapanese.com/practice/  (replaying the same once and once until you get it) Then, if you said yes to both, congratulations, this is your perfect game. But remember, this won't teach you all about a language but vocabulary (in my opinion, that's the most boring thing in a new language  but since this game show it as a challenge it can be pretty fun).

												The game initially was a fun to start learning a language. It's very similar to learning from flash cards but it includes verbal cues. My main problem with the game is with its terrible word list system. You select objects and add them to your vocabulary list. The list is broken up into groups of 10 words. To learn the words you must pick a list of 10 and test yourself on it. Organizing words in these lists is a nightmare since you can only swap 2 words at a time. With 400+ words in the game this becomes nearly impossible to organize. Also, you can't remove words you've added to your list or even move them to a ""learn later"" section.			"

												This is not a learning tool. It's a fetch quest generator in disguise.You point to objects in the room and add them to the list, then you need to find these objects from the list of 10. Imagine running through the room from fridge to sofa to the baseball under the bed. In case this might be boring, there's another mode this game provides: you're a miniature plane, you fly (pretty fast) and shoot same objects from the same list.Thus, by tens you 'learn' the words. But you're no caveman - you find an object three times in a row, you learn it. That's it, it will never fade from your memory. Well done. 420 words is all you need anyway.There are better (and free) ways to expand your vocabulary and learn the language in general. Look up Duolingo or Memrise, to name a couple.			"

												Holy crap!  This is the second greatest language learning program ever created!!!As a disclosure--I do not know the developers.  I have never met them.  I was not part of the kickstarter.  Literally the first I ever heard of this program was when it was in a Humble Bundle this week.  I had all the other software, but this program/game interested me.  When I found it on sale in Steam, I pounced.I purchased the base ""game"" for Spanish, and the add-ons for Mandarin, Japanese, Russian, Korean and Latin.  I would have purchased at least 2 more (Dutch and Gaelic) had they been available.  At $2.50/per language, why would you not?I have now played a touch with each language, and I have to say that it is amazing.  It is a brilliant idea, and it is wonderfully executed.  Click an object, hear it's name.  Double click and see how it's written.  This software will NOT teach you a language.  You wil HAVE to augment it with some other form of learning.  What it will do (at least according to a few minutes of testing) is give you a larger vocabulary of nouns.  While not all that you need, nouns are a big part of what you will use.  BUY IT!!!!			"

Like others have said its a supplement to a whole. grammar and and general speach as far as i can tell aren;t gereally taught, but language mechcanics can be learned much easier in my opinion if you already understand a vast ammount of vocab.

												This game is great, learning this way is better than going to classes. I would greatly recomment this game to learn some basic vocabulary, verbs and adjectives. For me I'm doing Korean right now. However this is not going to get you speak the language fluently, it does however help you learn new words. The words will be pronounced by a native speaker which is great and it also includes writing. There is a lack of content in this game that would greatly improve the overall learning progress. Hence this is a great tool to add to your many methods of language learning adventure.			"

												For learning vocabulary this game is very good but you need to be aware of its limitations:- You are searching for words in a flat. Everything that can reasonably be in a flat is in it. Most of those are really everyday-vocabulary that is useful to know but you also get things like 'coat rack' which might not be something you need in your early everyday-conversations. On the other hand e.g. stuff like 'car' or most animal are missing. Still I'd say that overall the large majority is really useful vocabulary- if you're practising nouns it's obvious how it works: it asks for table and you click on the table but adjectives and verbs it's different: you get them via nouns that have a connection with them. A plant grows, you wash laundry etc. That can get difficult when there is more than one association you can make. A poster might be beautiful but in this game it's only associated with a painting...- you can either practise a list of 10 words that you made or a random list of 10 words. There is no possibility to limit this random list to just those you don't know well, yet. I know that Russian 'banan' means 'banana' by now. I don't need to go over at again and again. A possibility to stop asking for vocabulary you have already mastered would have been nice.For me those are only minor issues and I still think it's a great vocabulary-game.			"

												It's a nice little vocab builder. All 420 words in the game are moderately useful for day-to-day life. If you were expecting a robust language software, or even something that would let you string a sentence together, this isn't it. But it gamifies learning some useful vocab and it good for getting a feel of the language's phonetics. The only thing I think is lacking )(that I would expect for software this price) is a simple game/tool for other alphabets and the sign/sound correspondences of them. If you're looking at getting a language pack with non-Latin alphabet (e.g. Japanese, Russian), I would suggest learning the alphabet seperately before playing. There are much better free websites (e.g. Memrise) that teach orthography and letter sounds much better than this software.If you want to be fluent, move to another country. If you want to learn a lot about a language, get an expensive software like Rosetta stone. If you want to impress your friends with a few vocab items and learn something while playing seek and find, get Influent.			"

												Wonderful, just wonderful.From music 'so chill', to effective learning techniques that address kinesthetic; auditory; and visual learning styles, to just being pleasant as a whole to experience and easy to operate with a shallow learning curve that anyone with patience can learn (even if they don't 'game'), this game excels. And, contrary to popular belief found in the reviews I've read, this game also teaches you verbs and adjectives, along with actual objects.This game will indeed not teach you an entire language (like I thought it would from first impression before reading further), but it teaches you more-than-basic (as in diverse) basic vocabulary, actions and description-words. 400 new words (not individual words I think, so more like 400 things) per language? Bring it on.I picked up the Japanese version and am having fun coming back to it here and there to expand my knowledge and learn.TL;DRThis is a good, fun and painless supplemental and standalone tool that can be used to expand your knowledge in one or more of the several languages offered, though it isn't a comprehensive course.

												No, con Influent no vas a aprender una lengua pero sí, vas a adquirir o consolidar vocabulario. Recomendable como complemento de estudio, junto a una buena gramática y lecturas/visionados adicionales.Un par de pegas: es una pena que, al menos de momento, no haya conjugación verbal y sólo recorras el interior de la casa. Estaría bien poder salir a la calle, aunque fuese para léxico general (tienda, acera, carretera, autobús, coche, árbol... ). Por todo ello, considero que el precio debería ser inferior.			"

												This is not a game.This is software that can help you learn some words in a fun way. Nothing more, nothing less.If you are currently learning a language, or are planning to, or maybe going a place they speak the language (and feel like knowing, lets say, the word sneeze).. Then this software might be something for you. It's a different way to learn words. But if you think this is a game where you learn a new language while killing a boss, then you are wrong.			"

												Considering that i would argue that Vocab is the key part to learning a language this proves to be a very helpful tool. Like others have said its a supplement to a whole. grammar and and general speach as far as i can tell aren;t gereally taught, but language mechcanics can be learned much easier in my opinion if you already understand a vast ammount of vocab. TL;DR Get it while its on sale to add to your vocabulary and go buy a book on grammar. Then For the hardcore gamer switch your game menus to other language.			"

												This is not a learning tool. It's a fetch quest generator in disguise.You point to objects in the room and add them to the list, then you need to find these objects from the list of 10. Imagine running through the room from fridge to sofa to the baseball under the bed. In case this might be boring, there's another mode this game provides: you're a miniature plane, you fly (pretty fast) and shoot same objects from the same list.Thus, by tens you 'learn' the words. But you're no caveman - you find an object three times in a row, you learn it. That's it, it will never fade from your memory. Well done. 420 words is all you need anyway.There are better (and free) ways to expand your vocabulary and learn the language in general. Look up Duolingo or Memrise, to name a couple.			"

												Awesome idea but a claustrophobic experienceThe idea is quite good, there a lot of objects to learn, quite common and useful. It starts great, discovering new words and practicing. It has good graphics, it's really cheap, and the sound quality it's very good.The problem is after the first hour or two, it's not a game to finish in one setting, but the more you play the more boring it gets. There is some of the points I'd like to mention. -The music is great, but there are only 2 tracks, and this is a spaced repetition method, so, after a while of repetitions, it becames dull. -There is a story in the trailer, and you expect to visit all those cool locations to help Andrew Cross with his invention, but in the end nothing happen, maybe he is a NEET and that's why he is intented to solve his case sorely in his house.-There are not recorded articles (like ""la"" or ""el"" in spanish) with the words, which it's very important to remember when learning gender nouns in languages like Spanish, French or German. -The plane mode is useless, maybe in an open space would rock. -There are some western words that maybe you wont need in your target language, and there are a lot of words that are common in one country but there's no sign here. -Dlc is more like a traduction than a localization. Same content for all languages. If you plan to learn a new language, try it with another method, it's good for some vocabulary.  ---A note for developers: Why not put more areas instead of more languages. A lot of people think the product is ""incomplete"", because the trailer makes you think there's more to discover. It feels like you are milking the same assets. If you decide to improved the content I'd gladly change my review. ---Also I made a workshop for the program Controller Companion for this game, so you can use your gamepad, Check it out.			"

												This is my first review so I will just say the most important things. To give you a better inside of my experience, my native language is german and I bought the japanese pack.To all of the people who blamed this game for not teaching them the complete language with all its grammer rules. That is not what this game is supposed to do. This game will not teach you a language from scratch and it doesn`t have to. If you only want to learn a language by using only one source than this would definately not be your kind of game. But let´s be serious guys. I think we all should know that learning a language requires far more different materials and takes a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of time. This game is just for Vocabs and therefore should be used as additional tool beside your other study methods. Of course you will have to learn grammer and sentence structure seperately by using books or taking courses but that is to be expected. Long story short. This game mainly serves as a Vocabulary trainer. You have to think for yourself if it´s worth buying ""just"" for that. But I for myself consider it way more fun to actively learn the vocabs than to read them of some flash cards. (which for japanese easily cost double the price/ Kanji readings ect.)Lastly a little review specially for the japanese pack:Pro- The voice is good- it has many words for everday use- switchable between Hiragana, Kanji and romaji- you feel succesfull- more translations for the same wordCon- Just household items - just a flat to move in- many english words in a japanese manner (can be avoided by taking another word with same meaning)5/7  would recommend.

Kinda like an RPG game, and you talk to people around a city or something, and they walk you through simple sentences/objects and what not. Of course I wasn't expecting a story or anything, but a bit more interaction to help you learn sentence structures instead of just raw vocabulary that you can't really form anything out of.			"

It also has this annoying thing that when you're in TIME ATTACK, one of the gams levels for vocab you can do, the cursor will automaticly zoom in when you are looking at something, and will often make you click on the wrong thing. Even though this does happen, it still has helped me out ALOT with my german.

												In Influent you move around an appartment clicking on items to recieve a translation of noun and sometimes a adjectives or verbs associated with the item. After adding ten item words to your list you can then play a memory game to recall the item words are associated with. For more of a challenge you can turn off the sound or text for the words being requested. There is also a shooting mode where you fly a model plane to shoot the item associated with the requested word.That is essentially all there is to this game. It is a memory game where instead of choosing multiple choice answers for a word you can click on anything in the appartment to match the word. The Adjectives and Verbs are also made easier to associate because the associated Noun is written in brackets after the word (ie. ""Interesting [book]"" ). This game is a useful tool to help you build associations between household items and associated nouns, adjectives and verbs. - just a pitty some more interesting locations and items aren't included. It would had been nice for a museum so I could see words used for parts of machines and tools, or somewhere more public (like a train or bus stop) so words associated with people and purchasing or travelling could be included.

												I've noticed many negative reviews about the game with the expectation it will teach you the language you're learning, but this is more like an interactive tool to increase vocabulary and association. You explore the house and find many things, which you then get tested on. You can do casual or timed exams depending on how adventurous you're feeling. I dislike that you have to unlock the words before being able to study them, but other than that it's a great addition for anyone looking for an additional means for their studies. If the regular price is too much, then definitely pick this up when it's on sale. You won't regret it!			"

												A great game for learning a new language. Although the content is limited to mostly nouns and a few verbs, it still learn you those really well, and the words are more likely to stick.Studying a new language take time, so be patient. With that said, the game are leaving out a lot of context, grammar and so forth, which doesn't really fit this style of gameplay. So it's great for learning the nouns and verbs, but to learn a language as a whole, this game falls short and should only be seen as a supplementary solution to regular studies.			"

If this was a whole city then it would REALLY be an incredible tool for language learning, but in it's current state it's just too limited to be actually useful. Hopefully they expand on the concept, though, because if it was a whole city to visit, each with names, and perhaps the possibility of conversing with people (effectively treating the conversation as a test of the knowledge the user has) it could become a really incredible tool for learning languages.

												First of all I would only reccommend it, if you get it on sale. Since 10$ are just too much for a tiny 3D environment and some voice effects. Also there seem to be no updates (its almost 2 years since release and no additional rooms/words have been added).Of course the game cannot teach you any grammar, and its just a small tool that can help you if you use it properly. If you already have a basic understanding of the language and writing system you want to learn, then it can really be a fun additional exercise to extend your vocabulary. The vocabulary in this game is not top priority stuff for beginners, but if your goal is to become fluent in the language you will have to learn all these everyday objects sooner or later.You can build a vocabulary list by clicking on various items, then do a ""race"" challenge where the names pop up and you have to find the corresponding items. The vocabulary tool keeps track of how well you remember the words, although this is very rudimentary (a red/yellow/green symbol). By doing well in these races you unlock points with which you can unlock adjectives or verbs related to the nouns in the game. This extends the vocabulary of the whole apartment to several hundred words, enough to keep you busy.Overall, I think the game is useful if you are self-studying a language and sometimes need a little motivational boost. It helps pick up some new words with correct pronunciation, but afterwards to keep them in long term memory, I would move them into a spaced repetition tool like Anki.			"

 Fantastic educational tool for those with realistic expectationsThis game is a fun and useful addition to a growing pool of inexpensive or free language learning software. While not a comprehensive course, Influent presents a truly impressive model for the gamification of acquiring basic vocabulary. Players find themselves navigating a 3D home with hundreds of objects to interact with. As you explore, vocab sheets are created which you can later test your knowledge of by associating objects with presented words (unfortunately the opposite has not be implemented). With over 400 nouns, adjectives, and verbs, players can use the game as a jumping off point for learning a new language. When you combine with something like Duolingo, it becomes apparent how wonderful the digital age is for those of us who love to learn! "

												This is a great supplement to drilling vocabulary for a language. However, it is greatly limited by the objects within the game.What is wonderful about it is that it tries to mimic your household items. So even when you're not playing, you can look around your room and try to recall or speak out the words you've been practicing.This is slightly more advantageous then drilling a set list of vocab words in a 101 book, or from a class. As those list are fixed to a lesson plan, and it's a bit harder to grasp as you are relying more on flash cards rather than visual associations to the object or action.I recommend this to anyone who wants to increase their elementary vocabulary of a language while learning a new language. This however, does not help you construct any grammatically correct sentences for said language, nor would it help you with verb tenses nor particles.			"

												To clear up any confusion, Influent is not ""a Language Learning Game focusing primarily on vocabulary"". It is purely a vocabulary builder and nothing else.Having said that, it is the best example of turning the boring task of vocabulary memorisation into a game that I have seen. I have ""mastered"" over 400 words and it was actually *fun* to do so, which is something I can't say for books or flashcards. Assigning the words to virtual objects has really helped me remember them. The testing method involves hunting down items that belong to lists of 10 words at a time. It's quite limited in this regard but it's not bad.I'm using the Norwegian DLC so can't comment on the accuracy of other languages, but I have found one incorrect word so be sure to check against a dictionary when learning / playing.

So I have played this game with Russian many times, and have slowly gotten better with the words I either forgot or didn't know. I really recommend this game, BUT it's a bit tricky. Is it tellling you the color of the item, the size, what it is, what it's for. Because of knowing the language, it has confused me several times. The word does not tell you the context of the word, even with the translation option. In other languages, there can be other meanings to a word that are not what you expected from that item. But one thing is for sure, some of it is funny. I see a word translated, and it's correct and proper, BUT to hear a Russian say the same word for the same item is sometimes weird and funny.  Remember, immersion is the key to learning a language, not translating. I RECOMMEND THIS.			"

EDIT: Got a few more language packs and they do are in essence the same as the Japanese languange packEverything in this game can be clicked and for everything clicked you will hear the word and then be able to see it written, rehear it and see what it looks like at the same time in your vocabulary list. You choose if you want to see the word written out in english aswell. You then master each word (getting it right several times in a row while using time attack) and thus complete your tasks.Its not easy, because you have to remember a lot of words, but thats what makes it so great. You actually have to remember the words (10 words to be mastered for each time attack). You'll then notice how you remember what these things are called in real life aswell.EDIT: Mastering and finding all the word is hard. You might want to check a guide, in order to find all the words.The developers are very into the game and they keep adding new language packs and are working to expand the game, so you'll have more areas to explore and new words to learn. They're a 2 man team and they're doing a great job keeping up and giving us updates on their progress.Buy this game if you want to expand the vocabulary of a language that you're learning. I would even recommend buying at the full price, since it's cheap for such a great game. 10/10			"

												I really think this is a great game and it was just what I was looking for to help my Mandarin studies.  Since it's the only thing like it for Mandarin it is a gotta have!  I like the words by page idea when I started playing, but would also like to see a ""sort"" funtion that could be used to put all the words I am having trouble with at the top of the list.  I don't like going through all the words that I think I have already learned.  I have already done 14 pages!  Will an expanded version be coming out?			"

												I picked this up to supplement Duolingo. I like that several languages are supported, so you can live those polyglot dreams.There are frustrating points though, mainly the controls. You are tested by finding objects in your apartment, sometimes it's hard to get over to the thing you want in time. Clicking the fridge when you meant to click the butter *barely* taller than its shelf or trying to click something really small while feeling rushed by the timer. There are no other people to interact with and you are stuck in your house.It also doesn't teach you to use the language so much as builds your vocabulary of household objects. Despite these shortcomings, it's a great way to break up the routine of learning. Don't expect it to be all you need, but a nice diversion in the right direction.			"

												While this game is not a way to learn a language, it is a good way to learn some basic vocabulary.  It is suprisingly useful in that regard because it contains so many every day household items, something that seems to be overlooked by actual language courses.In short, don't rely on a game like this to teach you a language, but buy this game to augment your vocabulary with many words that you'll actually be able to use.  Those other courses can teach you those great party phrases like ""Please get your mottled chinchilla out of the bidet,"" which, really, you'll only be able to use once or twice a year.  Now I can ask where my keys are, something I can use four or five times a week.  I already know that chinchilla is living it up on the town with my wallet, so no need to ask about that...			"

												I really don't understand any bad review on this game unless it's about technical issues.It's amazing the ton of words you can learn in such a fun way.The best part of this game are the challenges. You can disable the voice, the display name of the object ( so only voice ) or change to romanization to learn how to pronounce the word. You can change this settings if you want to challenge your self.100% RECOMMEND			"

												I played it for a bit and I can say I really like it. Unfortunally it does lack some diversity. Adding some different game modes or even more space to walk, because it´s not a lot, would be wonderful. Just a small thing. Also some minor flaws with articles and their gender, but nothing shocking really.Since it had a 50% discount for my learning language (Italian), it´s worth it to me. Boosting my  day to day vocab in a playful manner is really joyful compaired to boring abstract book reading.I therefore recommend this game for those who need to quickly boost some general vocab. But naturally this game won't make you fluent. If you want to make the most of it, try to think of ways to enhance the learning experiance by speaking about the objects to yourself out loud. Like: That book seems bigger than the toaster over there! or: Darn, I forgot my keys, where were they? Were they next to my wallet on the cabinet?Just great fun, but 10 euro is a bit too much for what you get when thinking about it. But if you have the luxury of a generous steam wallet, then I suppose you should just do it fam.			"

												A great game with the understanding that it is strictly vocabulary based. 400 words is enough to get you started learning a language. With that said, if you are learning a non-latin based character system (as in, your language does not using letters ""abc"" but instead uses Chinese or Russian ""letters""), you will need to learn that on your own, as this game does not teach this to you. I purchased the Russian starter pack, and luckily for me, I already learned the Russian ""alphabet"" before purchasing.I like how relaxed the environment is in the game, and that you can interact with virtually anything within the environment. It's fun to learn, and effective. I'm planning on picking up a French and Danish language pack soon. For $10.00, it's definitly worth the purchase. It really does help you learn solid vocab. I hope the developer continues working on this game, because this could really help a lot of people truly learn a language. I would definitely support this project. Now for some recommendations: I wish the game could have extended its boundaries to an outside world, such as a playground, a school, etc. It would have been nice to get more than roughly 400 words, and to be able to learn grammar. Maybe an interactive story where you practice grammar? The possibilities are endless.			"

												I played it a long time ago. It's a very basic vocabulary program. I would like to see Multiple choice gameplay options like they say a word and then ask the user to choose the correct object. This can be extended to doing what is told to see if the user understood.			"

												I'd be lying if I said that there was nothing to take away from this game. I initially put off buying this game for a loooong time - as the price for what seemed at the time a terribly experimental game was a bit steep. However, speaking after playing it for a while - it is more than worth it's full price in content.Wanna build your vocabulary in another language? This is a good place to start.			"

												Influent is a language learning game that was originally was a kickstarter. What this game lacks for depth is makes up for the sheer number of languages available. This game excels at teaching your vocabulary for items your would find around the house, but doesn't teach your any grammar for stanx for sentences. Still for $10 for the fist language and $5 for each language after you can't be to picky. Also this game is often on sale either on Steam or in a Humble Bundle, so if the price is still a little steep for you you can wait for a sale. I would recommend this game to anyone just starting to learn a language or to someone who is struggling with vocabulary for a language given language

												This learning game has a great concept and I feel that it is at the right price-point for what you get. This is great for absolute beginners to a new language, as it teaches you some basic nouns, verbs, and adjectives in a hands-on kind of way. The only downside is that it feels like the first level of what should be a much longer game. I'd be happy to pay for DLC packs in other game environments, like an office, a general store, a grocery store, classroom, etc. It would be great to get some basic phrases or questions worked in as well. I hope the developer adds these features in the future.			"

												Great tool for vocabulary building. Having a second installment that deals with basic grammar would be a great addition to the Influent family. It was enjoyable wandering around the house and trying to find as many things to name as possible. That said, my greatest enjoyment still came from the store comments from players describing their hellish experiences in a house that they can never leave, surrounded forever by objects that they speak the names of over and over again, slowly losing their minds. It's not a ""game"", so bear that in mind when playing. It's an interactive learning tool, and I will rate it according to that.7/10, nice concept and pretty useful learning supplement.			"

												I bought this game for my toddler who has been in Russian language classes for a few months now. She's been picking it up slowly over time and recently began to ask newer words on her own so figured it was time to try this game out. She immediately loved it. I let her pick which objects she learnt the words for and made it easier for her to learn, since she was directing her own learning and was more meaningful for her. That said, like all the negative reviews I'd LOVE to see a bigger environment: an office, classroom, street view, etc. More common things that would be useful to know if you're were just starting a language. That said this program is not good for learning how to speak a language. I having studied Russian in the past while living there and my daughter being in a class has filled that void, this program simply teaches more words for her arsenal. It MUST be supplemented with an actual language program that teaches sentence structure and grammar but is a good way to learn words in a fun way on your own. All in all this game serves its purpose, it teaches you words that you'd likely need to know in a foreign language especially if you were to travel there and know nothing of the language at least you'd be able to say: toilet, sandwich, soap, etc if you needed to buy something on the economy. Obviously, you'd look crazy if you were just saying random words but it would let you survive for a bit. Still I'd love to see more environments but for the price you get what you pay for which isn't bad. Suggestion: newer environments as DLC, therefore it’s not free to the developer and still keeps the game fresh and the knowledge flowing like a river.			"
