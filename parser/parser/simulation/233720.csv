												Fun game, but ♥♥♥♥ that ambulance driver. I mean. COME THE ♥♥♥♥ ON. He cant drive that thing steady for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes? I have 2 major issues with that driver. One, I decided to wait until we got to the Hospital. The patient wasnt fatal and was stable. I WAITED 5 ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS, AND WE NEVER GOT THERE. Clearly he has no idea where he was going. He didnt even pull over to let me safely preform the operation. AND 2... While we were driving, the door randomly opened up. Me, wanting the upmost safty durring this operation, decieded that I should close it. It was at that moment that I realized that HE IS SWEARVING TO AVOID NOTHING. This means that my driver was ♥♥♥♥ING WASTED ON THE JOB. So other than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ partner, good game.			"

												I've always wanted to become a doctor, and this game fully prepared me. Not even kidding. I performed my first real life surgery yesterday. Kidney transplant. With a motherstuffing pencil. Ended up switching the man's kidneys with a fire extinguisher and a watch. We laughed it off at the end though, so everything is cool. He likes his new kidneys.			"

												In Surgeon Simulator 2013 you control Nigel Burke, a guy who can't even tie his shoe laces without making ""finger spaghetti"" out of himself. Anyway, you control his fingers and thumb using the keyboard, which works well at simulating a hand. The controls can get a little frustrating, however I think that was a little on purpose. Now, most of you are all wondering the same question: Does it have a good story? Yes. It shows a man who poses a lack of hand motor skills and has a dream of becoming a surgeon, the best surgeon, but you are the only one who can fulfil his dream. The story and game play intertwine nicely and always makes you ask the same question: Was it worth it? As you stare down at the life insurance fee, was it worth it...? That aside, the game has three different types of surgery: Heart Transplant, Kidney Transplant and the Brain Transplant. They all are extremely fun and varied and include funny references, while you Tomahawk Chop someone in the skull. There is also a few secret levels, which I won't tell you about since they are...secret. Just go easy on the heavy (I've given my condolences to enough Team Fortress characters). In a nutshell, Surgeon Simulator controls well,  Has frustratingly-fun levels and even the starting menu provided for several minutes of fun. NOTE:  This is my first review, so I know it isn't that good, however I hope to get better as I write more.			"

												Most of us are well short of the level of education and subsequent anatomical knowledge required to successfully perform a heart transplant. Still, who wouldn't mind experiencing the awesome wave of heroic accomplishment that washes over a surgeon each time he or she saves a person's life? Surgeon Simulator 2013, a game from Bossa Studios, won't help you be a surgeon. It won't help you save lives, either. Hell, I'd even go as far as to say it has a negative influence on your personal knowledge of what invasive surgery actually entails. What it does do, almost in spite of itself, is haphazardly simulate the thrill of ripping a man's heart out of his chest and replacing it with another one.Surgeon Simulator 2013 replicates surgery the same way Enviro-Bear 2010 simulates a bear driving a car; with one hand and deliberately obtuse control. You play as Nigel Burke, or, more specifically, you play as Nigel Burke's left hand. Each of Nigel's fingers are controlled with your fingers on the A, W, E, and R keys, respectively, while Nigel's and your thumb is left to the space bar. Yes, that's completely insane, and yet also sort of logical position for your hand on a keyboard.Surgeon Simulator 2013's clumsy control is more of an endearing hook than a frustrating point of contention. It seems impossible, but, like rubbing your stomach and patting your head, an operational degree of control is gained with a bit of practice. Plopping Nigel’s hand down on a scalpel and watching him haphazardly pick it up like a cave man holding a pencil is both effectively hilarious and functionally acceptable. Hovering the hand over an artery and dropping it to replicate some sort of crude sawing motion looks absurd, but typically manages to get the job done. Playing Surgeon Simulator 2013 for a couple hours grants an almost expert level of control, but being a novice is almost more enjoyable simply because of how ridiculous everything appears when swinging Nigel’s dumb hand around the operating table.It helps that Surgeon Simulator 2013’s proposed method of surgery is almost completely unrealistic. Despite being mostly about goofs up to this point, there's a neat little game packed in Surgeon Simulator 2013. If you wreck Bob's guts too much he'll start bleeding, and if he bleeds out completely you'll murder the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and fail the surgery.Spontaneity is perhaps Surgeon Simulator 2013's finest asset. Being physics-based game loaded with a ton of props, it's prone to numerous instances of accidental mishaps. Since Nigel's arms controls like your arm if it had been numb for three years, knocking all of the extraneous crap over on the operating table is a common occurrence. Likewise, accidentally dropping your scalpel, bone saw, or plastic spoon inside Bob's chest cavity is frequently unavoidable. From getting a scalpel lodged in your palm to accidentally administering hallucinogenic drugs on yourself, Surgeon Simulator 2013 is loaded with random and surprising tomfoolery.Obscene humor is the reason to play Surgeon Simulator 2013, and it delivers that asset in spades, but down the line it actually morphs into a legitimate challenge. After failing twenty or whatever times, I was sweating bullets the first time I managed to complete the kidney transplant. The sheer amount of things that could go wrong, not the mention the sloppy control, made for a true feeling of accomplishment upon completion. It's nothing like real surgery, obviously, but I did feel the overwhelming need to high five every one around and celebrate once I finally got it right.Half the fun is mentioning the premise of Surgeon Simulator 2013 to a buddy and then watching him or her come to grips with the outrageous task before them.And there you have it. Surgery Simulator 2013 is a joke, and its creators are well aware of that fact, but it’s effectively the best game about completing surgical procedures with a phantom limb ever made.			"

												The Three things I have learned from Surgeon Simulator:1) You are most likely not to get sued if you leave a scalpel in somebodies stomach at the end of a surgery.2) Ripping someone's heart out during surgery and slapping the patient's face with it is totally legal.3) Intestines make a great scarf.Conclusion: Why the hell not buy this game?

												Surgeon Simulator is ridiculously stupid yet somehow manages to be frustratingly fun. Your role is simple. Play doctor and transplant specific organs without letting your patient die. Sounds complicated right? Well the game severely dumbs down the process effectively letting you rip out anything you don't need to focus on the task at hand.Learning the controls is actually half of the fun. You only get one hand in the game, but you have to control that one hand with two hands of your own using both the keyboard and mouse. The mouse moves your wrist and arm and the keyboard grasps your fingers to grab tools and organs. It's quite tricky to get the hang of because it just feels so unnatural and it can be quite a challenge to hold tools at just the right angle to make that precision cut.Although the title may give a false sense that it showcases some realism, there is no doubt that Surgeon Simulator is designed for purely amusement purposes only. And it certainly excels in the amusement category. An extremely original concept plus very innovative gameplay make this a game worth trying at least once.			"

												A hyper-realistic surgical procedure simulation program, likely used the world over to train medical professionals.Playing this intense game, you get put second-by-second in total control of a mans life.The real world physics and photo-realistic graphics, combined with the Oculus Rift support makes this an unforgettable experience, almost identical to performing real open heart surgery yourself.As such, it is a very gory game and should not be attempted or even purchased by the weak of stomach or those with a tremorous disposition.It is also impossibly difficult, requiring a stready hand, a sweaty brow and utmost focus. Do NOT play if alone, under the age of 18 or have not had 3 years in medical school beforehand. Highly difficult, very realistic, outstandingly educational.I look forward to future productions from this outstanding simulation company.			"

												Surgeon Simulator is a first person QWOP game. You take the role of a surgeon named Nigel Burke. Mouse movements control your doctor’s hand, up, down, left, right, and rotating. A, W, E, R and space bar are all used to control individual fingers on the hand, this is used to grasp the utensils, The game play consists of the player trying to complete a number of different operations on your patient, the first being something as simple as a heart transplant. Once completing the first operations, you then unlock different scenarios, such as ambulance operations, ad space operations, which incorporate bumping round tools and zero gravity, The graphics are nicely presented and everything looks clean and polished, I don't think photo realism graphics would be something I would be looking for in this type of game anyway. The soundtrack is mainly the general hospital/emergency theme tune the whole time, I had to turn it off after the first hour or two as it just grew very repetitive very fast, all of the sound effects in game of the grinding, sawing and squelching are all very nicely produced. This game is hard, like, hard as nails hard, I am nowhere near completing it, and I have played for almost eleven hours, your hands start to ache if you play any more than an hour due to the intense holding down of the buttons and thought that goes into picking up a single item, it is unbelievable, I did try out using a controller using Pinnacle Gaming Profile (quick shout out to them while I am at it), and this did make the controls a little easier to use, but it was still stupidly difficult.I haven't found any technical issues, I would think a potato could run Surgeon Simulator; it's a well optimized game.A lot of the time I spent on this was playing with friends, just playing around seeing how messed up we could get, and that's what this game is all about, just having a laugh and giggle, it's hard to sit down on your own for hours at a time on this game just because of how strenuous it is on your hand and thought process just to pick something up. But I do recommend that people pick it up, just for the novelty value and for some couch gaming with friends.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Long spoken of as myth, fairy-tale or merely the raving delusions of a mad man, an ancient and mysterious evil has awoken and proven itself a very real and dangerous threat to all in the once pleasant land of Infirmary. But there is yet hope as a band of unlikely heroes unite to vanquish this foe and send it back to the vile domain from whence it came. Play the roles of plucky Pinkie, the young but eager son of a blacksmith, Ring, the exiled princess trying to win back her rightful place as heir to the throne, the short-tempered Middle with a past shrouded in secrecy and an apparent score to settle, Thumb, the stoic and noble paladin sworn to defend the realm, and their brave leader Index, who together form the brotherhood of The Hand of Nigel, as they set forth on adventure in a world filled with peril at every turn. Face hideous, demented foes throughout the course of your journey such as the snake-like Intesties, the oozing Liveros, and the worst villains of them all, The Board of Medical Examiners. Lay siege to their fortress of bones, but choose your weapons careful, as only the right tools will grant you access to their grotesque dungeons. Mere tiny blades and cutting devices will ne'er be enough to pass, but with steadfast determination and a mighty hammer you will see your way through to the inner sanctum. Once inside be prepared to face the horrible wretches that lie in wait for you, the bosses within the bowels of each twisted lair, including Master Pump, The ♥♥♥♥-taker, and the most sickening of them all... Big Brain. Only when these are vanquished will you truly be able to call yourself the Hero of Infirmary and claim the hand of the fair maiden Trisha. It is not a quest for those faint of heart or lacking in skill or valour, but great rewards await any warrior brave enough to take on this challenge as you traverse the wastelands, do battle astride the back of high speed carriages, and even magically voyage through the cold, dark void of outer space on your intrepid excursions. Find glory and pass into legend, or succumb to the forces of evil and meet your doom, but whatever you do, tread carefully lest you summon the wrath of the greatest danger of all, the all-knowing, omnipresent... Bob.			"

												Control mechanics might be tricky at first (Think Edward Scissorhands trying to stroke a Kitten), but with practice comes much blood loss and many near death experiences perfection.If you miss the manical laughter and sadistic 'oopsies' had in games like GTA when trying to be a do-good er but those crazy pedestrians just keep finding a way underneath your wheels, or walking into your fists whilst you're trying to make an honest living? Then this is probably up your street.Try your patience with juggling to keep your patient alive in between surgical shenanigans: don't fancy stabbing that eye to remove it for transplant? Perhaps spoon it out, or see if that ballpoint pen will suffice as a lever.Be the first of your friends to have successfully performed heart surgery in the back of a moving van and in zero-gravity on Extraterrestrial life. Don't worry about what your pals think, just imagine that priceless look from a potential new employer when you tell them of your field hours and lack of exponential experience!10/10 would skip med school to play this.

												I have no idea if you are going to like this game. It's a weird, hard to control, bizarre game. People compare it to QWOP and to the extent that it relies on playing twister with your fingers that's true, but it's much more than that. Each surgery is like a puzzle, trying to figure out which tools work and don't, finding the most efficient route through it. Achievements incentivize creative play. I mean, the most amazing thing about the game is that it exists at all, it's so absurd. But I think if you get past the initial curve you'll find a compelling score/time attack game.I'll also add that if you have people over to your house, non-gamers LOVE watching this. A casual hammer to the skull here, a drill dropped in a chest cavity there, accidentally throwing the replacement heart away. It's all good.You're looking at 8-10 hours for completion of every surgery with good scores, maybe 12-15 if you want to go to A++ on everything. The developers have also repeatedly updated the game with new free content, so I think it's fair to say that if you're the type that buys games to support a developer, this is a good choice.			"

												Maybe? I would ultimately say no. It is about manipulating a hand in minute detail using overly-specific controls. To wit: you can rotate your wrist, raise and lower the arm, and contract each finger separately. This hand of yours, you use it to manipulate objects in your environment to remove internal organs and replace them with new ones. In the process, hilarity ensues.There is nothing wrong with this, and I actually do think the emergent comedy of my in-game physical ineptitude is amusing, it's just not that fun to play. A lot of trial and error as I try to figure out which awkwardly held item is the best one to use to remove X-bit of anatomy, then awkwardly moving the arm around to get the correct grip on the tool, then awkwardly hacking out the bit. A lot of awkward manipulations going on, and at some point I'll mess up, or hack at the wrong thing while trying to hack at the right one, and the patient will bleed out, and I'll have to do it all over again. I can see someone having fun with all this. Unfortunately, I'm just not that person.			"

												The name should be «Mentally Handicapped Arm Simulator 2013». You control it via keyboard and mouse, rotating a hand, bending fingers and a wrist. In real life it takes a second to grab something, here it may take 30-60 seconds, in addition you may make a mess around. I laughed already at the main menu, which is part of the game, and I laughed out loud for the first 10 minutes of the surgery. Laughed like a kid. But then all the sandbox fun stops and you try to move on with the tasks. That's where it gets really annoying. It's both challenging and stupid, and I'm not eager for that kind of challenge. But I bet there's people out there who are. And you may be one of them.			"

												As an amateur home surgeon, performing surgery on myself and close relatives, I've always felt my field is given short shrift in the gaming diaspora. So naturally I was overjoyed when I discovered Surgeon Simulator 2013. Finally, an accurate portrayal of my day-to-day, and a chance to hone my skills. I used to be apprehensive about taking on those tricky triple heart bypasses in the zero gravity facility I maintain in my basement. But after just minutes with this highly realistic training tool, I feel like a veritable machine on the operating table! What's more, it turns out I didn't need my right arm anyway!It can get awfully dull down here. But now at least I've got the confidence to take my new-found expertise into the wider community, and it's all thanks to Surgeon Simulator 2013. Interested in the field? Don't waste time on worthless medical degrees or expensive bribes. Your one-stop solution is right here.			"

												Surgeon Simulator, if I were to sum it up, is 20 minutes of hilarious insanity, followed by a few hours of frustration, mixed with the occasional, satisfying, successful procedures.     Surgeon Simulator is packed with hilarious moments of utter chaos and insanity, such as performing dental surgery with a hatchet, bonesaw, and pencil, or trying to figure out the hilariously awkward controls to perform simple tasks like picking up your phone, or putting a floppy disk in a computer. You have probably seen all that on You Tube.But after about 20 minutes (varies from person to person), but the chaos gets old really quickly. And then comes the frustration.     You'll be trying to actually finish a surgery, only to be constantly pestered by your character's inability to perform simple tasks, such as picking up items, cramming his hand into tight places, putting more than 20 centimeters between his hand and the patient, inability to peek around his arm, and last but not least his spontanious fits of cerebral palsy.      Which is to say that sometimes your character will fail to pick up items despite his hand being straight on top of them when you flex the fingers, the reach of your arm is so short you cannot reach the farthest edges of the operating table, and in surgeries where the patient is upright, you can barely get your hand over your patient's head, making it nigh impossible to avoid smacking your patient in the face with whatever you're wielding. Besides that, your arm will almost constantly be blocking the view of either your tool or the organ you're trying to sever, and you will constantly drop things despite having a firm grip on them.     These arduous controls are what make the game fun for the first twenty minutes of intentional chaos and carnage, but are also what makes the rest of the game time horrible, and filled with unintentional chaos and carnage.     It does have plenty of good humor, though. I particullalartly liked the TF2 easter egg.I have decided not to recommend it, but this is only because I would not recommend it at its normal price. I bought it during a sale, and that is probably the primary reason I am not overly disappointed with the game.     If you like chaos and mayhem and randomness, then you'll probably have a good time. If you like to get stuff done, then this is really, really not the game for you.			"

												Beyond the absurdity and the humor, Surgeon Simulator can only offer frustration. Poor controls are taken as a core design philosophy and buttressed with any restrictive obstacle that came to mind. This is not the hilarious but humbling exercise of realizing how difficult complicated basic movement really is, this is a constant fight against a game that not only has to struggle to understand what the player wants it to do but also has trouble preventing objects from phasing in and out of each other. The lesson this game has to teach, what it demands of its players, is that they put aside the anger born of uncooperative controls to practice patience and precision in a world that has none. It's quite clever really. Shame all that's left to look back on is annoyance after annoyance, which increases level by level in the name of some sense of progression.			"

												I played this game hoping to learn something about surgery. I started playing, had myself having difficulties with controlling the left hand and found out that I won't really learn much about this field.I went on playing for a few more hours for some days and I enjoyed having control over Nigel's left hand. There are a lot of stupid things that you can do with the patient and I found both playing around with the patient and completing each of the surgical operations really enjoyable.Barnardshire had a couple of surgery options available. Unfortunately Bob had a lot of ailments which left him no choice but to have heart, kidney, and brain transplant. As Nigel, you'll have to do all the operations in different environments. As you go on and become more dexterous you can make Nigel become practically licensed. I had the most difficulty getting A++ doing the brain transplant inside an ambulance, paying attention to what happens in the environment can really help in making Nigel the best surgeon in the world. If you work hard you can even do your surgical maneuvers in outer space, who knows what may happen when things float all over the place?I am almost done with what the base game offers and I am looking forward to getting the Anniversary Edition Content for the eye & teeth operations plus the corridor environment.

												Intro:I feel that the main goal of Bossa Studios for the original game, was to get a quick laugh from the audience and maybe make some money off of it, I feel the same for this version. Ask anybody that owns it about why they bought the game and they will most likley say ""Because it looked funny"". I think the only reason you would buy this game is due to the fact that it looked freaking hillarious to see a scalpel jammed into some poor man's eye. I mean, who really want's to buy this for the pure challenge of preforming sugery on a patient? I would assume you want to buy this as an escape from the daily life, to the inner realms of video games where everything that happens is supposed to be a fun experience, and I think it does this fairly well.Gameplay:I think that the gameplay is pretty hard, and the fact that it is hard is just the point of the game. The devs as gamers thought about the most annoying things you could implement, and afterward implemented them. I think that the devs never expected this to be a really good game that people played and speedran just due to the fact that it was only intended as a quick laugh and nothing more. When it comes to the Pros and the Cons of the game I don't like adressing them just due to the fact that as previously stated, the cons were intended for the end product long before the release of the game. I can't judge the gameplay of this as it really depends on your sense of humor and expectations of what a game should be.Conclusion:Since this game was mainly to make a funny statement about something, I don't feel like you should even consider playing it like a real video game, but to play it as a form of comedy that you may come back to after a hard day of work. To actually play it as a fully fledged video game is just foolhardy, and if you want a FAIR challenging experience, I wouldn't really recommend it in any way shape or form. 100%ing this thing was really pointless in the whole scheme of things, and in all honesty it ruined the experience of ever playing a game like it again. I think if it's on sale (which it usally is) go for it, there is no crime in laughing at a fake man's misery, or doing psychologically questionable things to his organs, however, I urge you to never ever play it like a real game, but to only ever play it as a silly satire on the ""Simulation"" genre of today...Side Note: If I could give this a ""Mixed"" or ""So-So"" review I would use that instead, but alas I am stuck with the current steam system of reviewing something.

It's a MASTERPIECE  --  for an indie or simulation game!Cool GAMEPLAY for an indie game ==> (9/10)You'll simulate a surgery with one hand only, and there's no clue about how to do the surgery effectively before you finish the surgery. It's kind of gore because you can use the tools to kill the patients instead of help them. But, it's fun! *HAHA (laugh as KIRA)*Nice GRAPHICS for a simulation game  ==> (10/10)Some other indie-simulation games had a really, really, bad graphics. Seriously! *cry in bear simulator* But this one had a quite good graphics, and it runs perfectly on my potato PC (a 1.9 GHz processor and NVIDIA GeForce 820m with memory of 2GB RAM).Finally, I highly recommend you to play this game.

												I would recommend this game only if you have the 'PATIENTS' to deal with the lousy control game play.Was included in a  Humble Bundle deal  as bonus game making it a sweet deal .The first day playing I was ready to destroy my mouse and keyboard.Once I got the hang of the contorls I took off on it completing far more achievements then I expected. Will test and challenge you in many ways with various tools and 4 different surgeon modes  .The ambulance and space modes are a must try and a great test of your patients both for you and Bob!			"

												Okay...this game is fun for the first couple surgeries but it soon becomes boring. If you try to actually perform a ""successful"" surgery then be prepared to become VERY annoyed. The small glitches and clunkyness is also frowned upon.I honestly want nothing more to do with this game...RIP $10			"

												""HURP DE DURR IMMA BAD SURGEON!!1"" the crowing of YouTubers continues.  You wanna know why this game is so popular?  It's because of all those Million+ viewed videos of people screaming in frustration as they try to hack past a sternum and kill their patients.  It's another game like 'I Wanna Be The Guy', but the controls are purposefully horrible instead of being purposefully designed to kill you every second.This isn't a game you play for good fun or trying to be a real surgeon.  Surgeon Simulator 2013 is a joke app made by a bunch of chuckle ♥♥♥♥s in a very short time and is kind of a hollow gimmick once you get past the awful controls.The hand has a VERY limited range of motion, it can't turn any objects to any kind of natural position for precision, it's sluggish like you're moving through molasses, the hand lags a half second behind the mouse, and it's incredibly hard to grasp anything in your fingers without stuff flying all over the place and putting them in a worse position or out of reach.  (My arm actually started getting tired from trying to meanuever the mouse so much.)  This thing will be what you will control the entire game with from the Menu screen to the dozen or so surgeries you'll have.You also have to do it under a time limit as the more you cut and crush drains your patient of blood and you'll very soon have a countdown timer (blood loss) till the patient dies.  Get ready to start pulling your hair out as this exercise in frustration will leave you cursing at the screen for a long time like why the god damned hand doesn't grasp anything properly.I recommend looking through the Diskettes on the main menu that you can pop into the Commodore computer.  They show you shortcuts on how to more effectively cut the tiny arteries, scooping intestines, etc.There's not much content outside of the bare stages where instruments are strewn about.  You're a single surgeon inside an operating chamber and you have to perform a transplant of some kind in several different environments.  Heart, kidneys, and brains in a surgeon's ward, ambulance, and space.  There's a Team Fortress 2 level that's ripped from the Meet The Medic trailer and an alien autopsy.  That's it.  There's nothing else to do except try to go for a highscore, but it's worthless.  Once you're done, you'll probably want to quit the game and uninstall it.I get the ""joke"" of what this game is.  It's like a trainwreck made of organs and flying utensils, but the controls aren't worth it.  Avoid this crap.			"

												A fun, interesting and challenging game designed to promote anger management classes. Unique gameplay, with comical surgical procedures designed to test the intentional awkward controls to its max. Challenging achievements keeps you hooked and red in the face. Normally i'm very anger free during gaming, but this one really tested my patience. The anniversary additions adds extra challenges with the frustrating corridor scenario, as well as new eye and tooth transplant surgeries.CAUTION: High risk of inducing bouts of shouting and swearing. May results in damaged table, screen, keyboard and mouse.Pros:+ Unique and awkward controls+ Can either choose to be left or right handed+ Challenging achievements for those dedicated gamers+ Hilarious surgical proceduresCons:- Can be frustrating...to say the least- Awkward controls- Does not help to relieve stress after workMy Score: 8/10			"

												Surgeon Simulator is an unrealistic and silly game. It has intentionally strange and difficult controls, which result in a very challenging and occasionally frustrating game. It's not a game I would recommend for people who will overreact and lose their temper. Some of the levels are just hard to control, or may even feel unfair. I do think that the game is the most fun to play with friends, and has the potential for a few ""funny moments."" I'd compare it to I Am Bread (same developer), or Octo-Dad: Dadliest Catch (I don't know the developer for that one.)Overall, I'd recommend getting the game on sale and then playing it as a party game. Save the challenges and achievements for yourself, if you're feeling determined.			"

												I, at one time, might have discounted or otherwise insulted this game for being gimmicky and ironic, in private, to as many people as I could rant to.  Do not vote for this game, I said, for it is just monkey cheese nonsense being sold to dumb internet people.  But somewhere between not enjoying the demo and receiving the full version, this game grabbed me between it's shaky noodly fingers.  Between the awkward controls and the wonky physics is a game that actually works under it's own weird set of rules.  Sure you might drop a fresh organ or two on the floor, or lose a couple out of the back of a moving ambulance, and oftentimes it won't be your fault, but at the same time you'll likely just nod your head and realize that it's just another facet of the game and reload, ready and eager to take another crack at Bob's insides (was that one entire sentence?)Point being, this game is a celebration of the human condition, and a real testament to courage and the power to overcome obstacles that seem impossible.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll make your janitorial staff quit out of protest, but most importantly you'll learn to love and live.  And harvest organs.			"

												Surgeon Simulator 2013 is a surgical simulation game.The controls are suitable rudimentary. You use three keys to flex your fingers, and spacebar for the thumb. Left click can be used to move the arm up and down, while holding down the right button controls the rotations. There are items which, when you grasp near them, sort of “stick” to your fingers.The amount of content in the game is a little sparse, you can finish everything it has to offer in a couple hours. There are 3 main procedures, 3 variants to these operations, and 2 extra missions. After you have completed all of these there is only the fun of goofing around with the game to add to play time.There are also several bugs, like the hand got stuck in the table and you have to restart the operation. Sometimes the syringe does not work. Also a frustrating thing is that if an item falls a little too far on the table, you have to restart, because you can not reach it anymore.Surgeon Simulator 2013 is not a brilliant game, but a brilliant joke, in the form of a game.Sounds 5/10Graphics 5/10Gameplay 4/10Atmosphere 6/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												You play as a butcher who pretends to be a surgeon, but not an ordinary surgeon, it's a surgeon that has only one hand, wears no gloves and has the manual dexterity of a 3 year old kid!PROS:- You may learn something about the position of your guts;- You'll have an idea about how it feels to control a mechanical hand, like those used by people who had an amputed arm. But worse;- You may fulfill your sadistic instincts by killing your patients with surgical tools;- You may hit yourself with your own anesthesia syringe, which will make your vision psychodelic.CONS:- Controls are awful, VERY awful. Five keys on the keyboard control the closing of your fingers and the mouse will control the movement of your hand, just like a remote-controlled robotic hand would be;- There's no automatic adjustment of the objects to your hand, which means that you'll pick up objects any way you can, they will never be in the right position and will easily fall from your hand, again similar to a mechanical hand;- Your arm is always in the same horizontal position and will get in the way often;- If you drop something on the far corner of the table or let it fall to the ground you can't reach it anymore, it's lost forever;- It's too difficult to succeed, but possible if you try very, very hard and have a lot of patience (I don't);- Your patients are completely sedated and won't react to your sadism in case you like this kind of thing;- Your patients basically die by blood loss (there's a blood counter measuring how near it is to death), so whatever you do will have the same effect. The only difference is the speed of bleeding.CONCLUSION:Initiallly fun because of the absurdities, but infuriating thereafter. I can't recommend.			"

It was frustrating at first when you are not used to the controls, but as you play and experiment you will get used to the controls. At first I did not buy this game because I thought I'd see myself getting salty, but once I saw the Trump DLC I had to buy it.

I've accepted I will never complete a surgery, now I'm just looking to complete any achievements and get those drops!Only play this if you enjoy a true challenge, you will use both hands to hold, grasp and perform difficult maneuvers. You won't breeze through this one. I think the $13 price is much too high. I bought on sale for $1.39, so look for sales.Worth $5!

												Umm, so I have had this game for a few years and haven't played it much. You probably know a bunch of people on youtube who have played it in the past and have gotten mad with the difficult controls, and even if it's the real deal I find that I as well can't even play for 20 seconds without losing my mind. It controls bad (on purpose) and even if you complete the level and for example put the new heart in, it glitches out somethimes for me and the level never ends... you just sit there and do nothing. I have nothing against the people who made the game but I just don't like the game/controls. If you like the game that's fine but I would not have bought it if I would have known any better.			"

												7th of February 2016:To everyone who worked on this game: nice try, but go ♥♥♥♥ yourself with a car, die a horrible and painful death and rot in a sewer. Why?First have a look at this video: 


YouTube™ Video:  

			Views: 0		



Next, let me explain some of the things about this game:1) Glitchy collision models. Your hand and instruments will always keep getting clipped inside something or something gets stuck inside your hand or between your fingers. VERY frustrating when going for the challenges/achievements.2) Operations are 50% luck when it comes to finding the right spot where to cut. You can easily spend several minutes trying to find the spot you need to cut to proceed. Most frustrating being the eye transplants, where you need to stab Bob in both eyes with a scapel for example, but good ♥♥♥♥ing luck trying to get it in the eye, since it's apparently random when it decides to go in. The angle, force, position of the eye, NOTHING like that matters. The scapel goes in when it wants because ♥♥♥♥ the player. And don't even get me started with the Corridor -operations, where the RNG decides what you get next as random trolleys pass by, which BTW do NOT respawn the instruments that have fallen off. Good luck if they spawn clipping inside eachother and thus just exploding everywhere!3) Speaking operations and challenges, how can the Hell can you still have a game with such glitchy achievements? 180 spoon flip? Nah, barely 20 degrees did it for me. And don't even get me started on the achievements that fail to realize that you've completed them. And the biggest insult in challenges: ""I can see miles... per hour."" First the description: ""Complete the eye transplant in an ambulance in 1 minute and 60 seconds."" What the ♥♥♥♥ even is that? Did the devs REALLY fail with even a simple task of writing a DESCRIPTION?! If they can ♥♥♥♥ up even a simple description then how can they program the challenges, let alone an entire game properly?!I could go on with the flaws this game has, but I don't think the devs deserve the feedback.I will complete this game to show that I did manage to beat this piece of ♥♥♥♥, but NEVER expect me to buy a single game from Bossa Studios EVER AGAIN!YOU WILL NOT DEFEAT ME WITH YOUR LACKING PROGRAMMING!EDIT----------9th of February 2016:Came back to tell you that I have now reached 100% completion of this pile of junk. And let me tell you people, the inaccuracies are everywhere, especially in the Alien Operations! I also realized how much this game relied on YouTubers by adding achievements and alien organs after them. Yeah nice marketing trick you got there: make an organ or achievement after a YouTuber to have them play the game and get free advertisement.But let me tell you people, the amount of relief when I saw the last achievemnt pop up and then hitting ""Delete Local Content"" was much better than actually playing this game.Tata and good ♥♥♥♥ing riddanceEDIT----------4th of July 2016:I came back to write some more after you filthy ""FUNNY"" developers decided to add more achievements to this piece of ♥♥♥♥ excuse for a functioning game.You did it again. You ♥♥♥♥S did it AGAIN! You added some ""FUNNY"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t but you couldn't have been bothered to test it to make sure that works properly!You people STILL haven't fixed ANY of the issues, you've only added some! Look at the ""Small Loan From My Father"" -achievement. $1M in a medical bill? Okay, seems easy enough, right? ♥♥♥♥ YOU! What you need to do to get this achievement is to basically use a glitched and inconsistent mechanic because you CANNOT do this legitimately! I even red some forum threads that this is a bug. Okay, so you're working on it? How the ♥♥♥♥ is it taking a MONTH already to fix it?!♥♥♥♥ you then, I will play your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ piece of cancer of a game to get back the 100% completion.You are all a bunch of filthy and pathetic excuses for game developers.EDIT----------14th of August 2016:IN! YOUR! ♥♥♥♥ING! FACE!It took me a month to get the Small Loan achievement but I DID get it and now I'm back to 100% completion!And what REALLY shined through that time was the amount of ♥♥♥♥ Bossa passes through. The idea of the achievement isn't that bad, but when you basically have to glitch your way to the achievement because you CAN'T do it what feels like a sensible way. Because apparently SOMEONE at Bossa thought that it was a good idea to give more money for the hospital bill the harder you hit Trump, while it's already very easy to glitch your tools inside the models. No, not just loodging your tools in the ribcage, I'm talking about an AXE getting stuck INSIDE Trump's face  when you try piling up some more money.But still, once again, I have BEATEN your ""game"" and I am DONE with this ♥♥♥♥.

												Instruction manual to successful surgery:1) Stab the patient in his throat to prevent him from breathing. Breathing can cause issues with surgery.2) Reach your hand inside his chest and yank his heart out.3) Since their is no buget to replace it with a new one, insert a soda can.4) If the surgery still doesn't say ""success,"" it is glitching. Stab the patient in the chest with your drill to get it running smoothly again.After these steps, you should have completed a successful surgery.			"

												I can deal with the controls.My problem with this game comes from the lack of instructive feedback and repetitive music.It would be helpful if this game had some indicators on which part of the organ needs to be cut and why certain organs need to be cut while others can be torn out. Without any feedback, I can just flail with a scalpel until something loosens or the patient dies.			"

												Fun game, but unless you have the correct keyboard, you basically cant play. I even bought a more expensive keyboard to try to get it to work and i had to adjust the key mapping and have to spread my fingers out so far it starts to hurt after a couple of minutes. No controller support, which is odd bc i beleive this game is on playstation as well. So it seems like controller support could be added rather easily. but what do i know haha. Anyway, i have since found a list of keyboards that supposedly work perfectly. Just would have been nice to know the game required a top level keyboard to play before i bought it.			"

												Surgeon Simulator has given me the confidence that if I ever suffer a serious stroke, I can make a full recovery and become a surgeon after all my trauma.They should honestly make people going through physical therapy play this game, I have the full use of my hands and I still butchered patients at first, but after some time and practice, I was getting A++ ratings on every surgery I did, I even got abducted by aliens and fixed ol' ET right up, but I wouldn't mention that on my resume.While real life surgery might be a bit more complex, I truly feel like this game has prepared me for an emergency roadside operation if it ever has to come to that.

												I bought this game on a steam discounts, at autumn. And it was my first simulator I've ever played.For the first time, this game doesn't look like something big. It was older versions of surgeries with a small amount of operations. So I played a bit, and forgot about it. But then DLC comes out, I found, what the game got a big overhaul, and since I want to get 100% achievements in a game, I guess I should give it a try, and wasn't dissapointed.What can I say something else? Well, about some parts, like graphics or stuff. Graphics are good, physical part is fine (but sometimes physics are testing your patience), music is amazing. Something bad about this game? Well, if you are going to achieve 100%, this will gonna test your nerves so badly, because you need to be fast with a bit bad controls. Speaking of controls, you can't play this game for too long, because with default controls, you hand will be tired in 30 mins. I recommend you do some break after some surgeries. Well, I have nothing to say anything more.I definitelty recommend this game, if you want a simulator, what gives you a challenge. And also, to have a full experience of this game, grab a DLC.P.S Sorry, if I messed up, somewhere, with English.			"

												My patient, Bob, said he swallowed some food colouring, I guess that by then he'd DYED a little. I then tried to save him with an I.V but it was all in vein. Then we needed to perform brain surgery - but Bob said he wouldn't give us a piece of his mind. Then we became heart to heart. I then had a flashback - I remembered my Surgery exams - I made the cut. But I killed Bob. And it's all ogre now.			"

												This game is awesome. The charm is in the terrible controls, which are totally masterable. At first you'll be clunking around, ripping out organs and flinging tools across the room to hilarious effect, but as you get used to it you end up becoming, well, surgical with the horrible controls. I spent 14 hours getting all the silly achievements mostly because they were fun to do. If I had a Razer Hydra or an Oculus Rift, I'd probably jump back in the game just to try it since it's always enjoyable*.*Some patience and a sense of humor are not included with the purchase, which are required to enjoy this game.

												Silly, silly, silly. This game is an incredible amount of fun, though if you're squeamish at the prospect of flying digital guts and blood...well why are you looking at this game?But in all seriousness, the style is smooth and visually grabbing, the controls only mildly frustrating when you're on a time crunch (Use two hands, Nigel!), and the enjoyment factor is up to extremely satisfying. My favorite bit is that it even includes a side mission related to my favorite game Team Fortress 2, which if you haven't played, do. The menu is also them most uniquely extensive I've seen, and so much fun to interact with. Warning: You may become so distracted you forget there's an actual game attached.The only time Surgeon Simulator has frustrated me was when I was going for a couple of especially difficult achievements, but even then I still liked it. I mention this because if you have patience issues, you may find less enjoyment in it than I did, but I'd still urge anyone to try this game.			"

Can't really flaw this game it's very well polished and finished. Good value even if it's not on sale.			"

												Now just because i dont recommend it doesnt mean its bad. What im saying is dont recommend the game to people who ragequit or get angry when games glitch up. Sometimes the players hand can get stuck in the heart transplant patient's ribcage and you will have to restart the surgery			"

												This game is very good and very funnyIt's a calm, casual singleplayer game where you (obviously) do transplantsFirst in the Surgery then the Corridor then the Ambulence and then in Spacebut that's in the Anniversairy Edition; in the 2013 version there's only Surgery, Ambulence and space.In the AE you get to do more surgery in more rooms, it's like Surgeon Simulator 2013 and Surgeon Simulator Touch combined into one, but something very unique to the AE is the Donald Trump surgery, it's just like the first surgery but there's different tools, different HUD (which makes you feel like you're in the news) and no Green or Blue needles (you can't stop the blood flow) instead there's a pink needle with a golden tip which increaes  blood flow  and makes your hand like a babies' hand which makes grabbing tools much harder.I recommend you get the AE because it's more worth it			"

No, not the summer sale)Made with: UnityDevelopers: Bossa Studios About	Surgeon Simulator is a Simulation, and physics game where you are needed to use the tools in your surroundings to do Transplants(Ex. Heart, Brain). You must use the certain keys on your keyboard to close a finger. Close 4/5 fingers and see if you get an achievement. :).  Review	I think that this game has a charm and is very diffcult, fun, and amazing. Bossa Studios did a very good job making this game. It surprised me that it was made with unity. I just love this game!! Yes it is worth 10 dollars. Pros/Cons 	Pros:-Fun-Difficult-Keeps you coming back-Humorous-Good musicCons:-Few glithces, but none that are easy to notice-The freaking watch.

												Surgeon Simulator is one of these short joke games where the core of the gameplay is the hilarity that stems from overcoming intentionally awkward controls and buggy physics. You play as a newbie surgeon - or to be more precise, a clearly disembodied hand - who has to successfully complete various surgeries despite being clumsy as all hell.Don't look for any kind of anatomical accuracy or realism in this game - ripping off the patient's organs and throwing them on the ground just to get to the one organ that needs replacement is a regular practice in the game, and the mission is considered completed if you manage to throw the new organ onto the spot where it's supposed to be. Even if said organ falls out immediately afterwards while the game merrily displays the success screen (which clearly suggests that the patient wasn't going to survive one way or another). The only thing you have to worry about regarding the patient is making sure that the blood level doesn't reach zero. And yes, you can still finish the mission even if the patient is left with as little as 1 ml of blood. This game exists to be a source of dark humor, not to be realistic.You are given plenty of tools to accomplish various tasks and it's only up to you to decide what is going to be useful. Obligatory scalpels, various saws for cutting bones, drugs that either slow down or speed up the blood flow, and even axes, hammers and drills. Many of them, more often than not, are going to be only a hindrance in your desperate efforts, blocking your way to the actually important tools, bumping into the patient and making him lose blood, or even getting you high. And that's just the beginning.As I mentioned, the game isn't very long; there is 9 levels total, plus 2 hidden, and the exact time it will take you to complete them for the first time will vary depending on how badly you'll be initially doing. There are 3 kinds of surgeries in 3 kinds of environments, so at some point you'll end up in a situation where, for example, you have to do a brain transplant in an ambulance that rides on a bumpy road, with the objects jumping up at random and the back door opening from time to time. Probably the funniest moment you are going to see in this game is successfully completing said surgery and then watching as the brain you just put in the patient's head falls out right away and ends up on the floor or even on the road. The mission is still accomplished, so who cares!Surgeon Simulator is the kind of game that you either just can't stand, or love coming back to it despite how badly it frustrates you. And yes, after the initial hilarity wears off and you get better at playing it, you'll most likely start seeing the game's frustrating elements more and more. Probably the biggest one of them is how it can be a pain in the butt to actually grab things; there's NO indication whether you actually grabbed the damn object or not, usually resulting in you spending some time on the ritual of pressing the buttons to grab something and then raising the hand to see if you actually grabbed it.Another problem is that the game gives you next to no information on how various things work. There is no tutorial at all; the only thing you get is the info on how to control the hand, which is displayed on the computer in the main menu (and the said menu uses the exact same hand mechanics as well, to make matters even better). The rest you either have to figure out yourself (most likely failing numerous times before you successfully complete a surgery at least once) or just Google things up. The game DOES give tips on certain things, but that's only AFTER you completed a surgery, and only if you figure out that you can put floppy disks into the computer in the main menu. And let me tell you, doing so can be frustratingly hard as well, since the computer will only accept them if they're perfectly aligned.In the end, Surgeon Simulator is a little curiosity that some people will like, and some people will hate. My recommendation is to first play the demo provided by the creators of the game and see how well you'll do in it. If you'll end up loving the absurdity of the game, then I think you'll like the full game as well. But if you'll instead end up getting frustrated and/or freaking out over the patient dying, then I think you're better off giving up on this one.			"

												This is fun, and very challenging game. However, don't be fooled by the word 'Simulator' in the title. This game 'simulates' surgery in much the same way that the old board game 'Operation' does. You play the game by manipulating a single hand, and then using tools laid out around you to do the operations. Controlling the hand is difficult at first, but you get accustomed to it with time.If you ever wanted to attempt a brain transplant in the back of a moving ambulance, play this.			"

												Hopefully you've all played this game already, and you're just reading this review for the heck of it. But if not, I highly recomend it. You should buy it knownig it's a rage game and not be too surprised at that initial feeling of regret. Once you pass that point though, the game is just great. Try and A++ all procedures? Find and complete the secret procedures? Or, if you're like me, go for all the achievements! "

												Surgeon Simulator's controls are strange, but they are the best that a game like it can have using a keyboard and mouse. It takes a while to get used to and is sometimes quite frusterating, but it is very fun. This is not the best game you can get for $10, but it is a good game. It is quite challenging and of a very unique genera.			"

												THIS GAME IS SO DAMN FRUSTRATING!I love this funny, surgeon simulation game. You have a patient to operate on named, 'Bob', with 5600ml of blood, and you have a series of tools. Such as, hammers, saws, knives, etc. You can basically beat the crap into Bob for fun and achievements.The first level area is in a basic surgery room, with the heart transplant, kidney transplant and brain transplant. The second level area is in a moving ambulance (VERY FRUSTRATING) you have the same procedures as level one.The third level area is SO DAMN FRUSTRATING. You are in SPACE in a low earth orbit (LEO) with floating tools.The last level area is operating on an alien in an unknown region of space. It is entertaining. I recommend this game.			"

The ambulance levels become very difficult as if it wasn't hard enough already. Great little game for the sale cost it was. Good laugh for all. Also a great game to make funny clips for a YouTube video, or a good laugh on a live stream. Hopefully with next year's version they have some decent upgrades. Often times I find myself frustrated unable to grab certain things at certain angles. But overall, I definitely recommened the game to others to try out.8/10			"

												Hilarious and Fun!The best way to describe this game.The greatest streght of this game, just like ""Goat Simulator"" is that it goes beyond the initial ""Laugh -Spoof Factor"" and actually offers a challenging and intense game.Surgeon Simulator puts you in the hand (literally) of a surgeon, ready to operate some rather unlucky patients.The operations are rather absurd (like brain transplants and such) and the intentionally ""random"" physics make everything so much fun to play!If you want to you can ignore the mission goals to ""annoy"" (or brutally murder) your patient and the tools you use to ""operate"" surely are inappropriate...Saws, Lasers, Hammers ecc...it's pure madness.Highly recommended game.Pros:- Fun to play- Hilarious- Many collateral activities (starting from the menu itself)- Many easter eggs and secrets- Challenging (in a good way)- Fun to play even when creating a senseless mess.Cons:- Only 3 types of operations (remixed in very different ways, though)To Keep in Mind:- The controls are very hard to get used to and disorienting, for the first hour...but after a while you grow accustomed to them and actually appreciate how they work.

Will It Run?I have only ever written a review for Steam games that are exceptionally easy to run on almost any computer. As for myself I can hardly run Minecraft but I have no problem running Surgeon Simulator. Even on max quality settings Learning CurveGame just comes with practice but then again it isn't skill based at all. I would compare it to a standard phone game it only gets easier by playing over, and over again.About The GameIn case you haven't noticed from the game trailer or a video of this games gameplay. It's not anywhere close to being a Surgeon Simulator. In this game, you have to grab any object around you that looks decently sharp and attempt to tear and rip out your patience organs until you have reached whichever organ you are preforming a transplant on. At that point, if it were a heart transplant for example. You would have to rip out the heart and simply drop a new clean healthy one in its place. Not saying this game is bad but I to clarify for the few people who think its an actual surgeon simulation. "

												If I could have any profession, ignoring all college costs and other ties, I would want to be a trauma surgeon. This is as close as I'm getting. And sure it's not exactly how surgeory is, like you don't use a ball pein hammer to knock teeth out! You use a claw hammer, we all know that. But it still makes you feel the power a surgeon must feel, performing on this obviously sick Bob, who's in for every operation known to man. Seriously, if you need a new heart, kidney, brain, and eyes then you should probably just pull the plug.This game is tough to play if you have a laptop, so make sure you have a mouse too if you plan on buying.

												A very difficult but fun and unique game that requires you to be calm and collected, especially when well.. you get high. You have to learn to be precise in controlling your virtual hand to for instance poke out eyeballs with pencils or place kidneys in their specific gaps (worst thing in the world). Alternatively you can bash your patient's head with fire extinguishers and electrocute yourself. This game is filled with dozens of tiny secrets and unfortunetly if you want a 100% achievement completion, you will have to look things up. This game isn't perfect, there aren't many levels - only 5 basic types of surgeries in a couple of settings. I hope in the future some DLCs will be released.

												Got this in a Humble Indie Pack.One wonders... can anyone be dissapointed by a $1 game?Surgeon Simulator has the dubious honour of answering that with ""yes""... a feat previously unthinkable. Stick to the Youtube vids... they can be somewhat enjoyable, unlike the game itself.			"

												Truly, a real indie game.This game lets you be a doctor, yes, a ♥♥♥♥ing doctor, without needing to study.You can maul your patient or you can heal him, both options are funny and cool as well.The game includes secret areas, secret pacients, different kind of surgeries in more than 4 different places.About the gameplay, basically you're a hand, your job is to move this hand and TRY to manipulate the tools to perform the surgery (or not). When you press the keys you really think that you're, in fact, the hand that performs the surgery. The funniest part of the game is trying to use the tools, maybe if you watch a gameplay You will probably say: ""Seems easy, I don't know how this idiot can't use a drill"", well It is not so easy as it looks.The idea of the game is not ""have a good game story"", It would be most like: ""There you have, a human being, kill or try to heal him, good luck"".It combines a hilarious theme and the seriousness of a surgery, having as a result this masterpiece. That's what makes this game one of the best inde games that I've ever played.9/10			"

												If you happen to have an operation scheduled for the near future, then playing Surgeon Simulator will be like watching Final Destination prior to boarding a plane. If, like me,  your operation was 7 years ago, then you will be left with the unsettling idea that there may be a wristwatch lodged in your ribcage.Infuriating but good fun.			"

												You buy it, play it once, have a lot of fun, and then never play it again. This game just sits in my library, gathering dust, yearning for me to play it, but I never do. And I never want to. This was absolutely a waste of money, and it's money that I can't get back because I spent more than 2 hours playing it the first time. Now it sits there and stares at me, making me regret buying it everytime I pass it when I scroll through my games.			"

												This is game is one of the best dark humor games. It also has plenty of content (which takes forever to finish) and tons easter eggs. You get to do whatever you can't do in an actual surgery, whether its drilling a hole into your patient's skull, blowing up baboon hearts, or slapping him with his own intestines. What else do you want? GET IT! NOW!			"

												Do not buy this game. I'm still stuck on the first task: controlling the damn thing. Before I'm told to get better at it, let me say this. This game is very similar to QWOP, as in the controls are meant to be very difficult and the game is not meant to be taken seriously. However, QWOP is free. This is $9.99. I bought Bastion, one of the best games ever made, in sale for about $2.00 (I can't remember the exact price. Sue me). Speaking of the controls, the difficulty here is more artificial than anything else. Let's compare this difficulty to another difficult game- Super Meat Boy. I think JonTron says it best: ""[It's] ball-renchingly difficult, but you know what? The controls are so tight that if you mess up, it's entirely on you, and that feels good. It's great. Difficulty isn't the problem. Cheapness is."" Say you're doing the heart transplant and the heart gets stuck in the ribcage. Cheapness. That's one word that actually sums this game up pretty well. Except for the price tag compared to the quality of the game.			"

												Is it ""Surgeon Simulator 2013"" or ""Frustration Simulator 2013""? I'm asking, because this game looked cool when I watched people playing it. I was aware that it's hard and annoying, but I decided to buy it and give it a try. If it's about me, it was funny in the beginning, several minutes of the beginning. Later it begun to be frustrating and completely not entertaining. I know it is to be like that, but I wish there were some difficulty levels. Anyway, I was not entertained by this one.			"

I began my day at the hospital by throwing EVERYTHING off my tables. That was my morning until I had lunch. The phone rang so I threw it off the table as well, received an acheivment,I then took control of my ADHD and decided to operate. I then stuck a bunch of needles in my hand and cut my fingers on a huge blade. All of that while the patient is laying with his whole freakin chest wide open and I didn't forget to smack him around as well.WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS? GO BUY IT!

The controls are terrible on purpose, things drop and fall out of your reach on purpose, this game is supposed to be comedic. I've tried playing it on my laptop without a mouse but I couldn't move the hand up/down or rotate the hand without it. So make sure you have a mouse before you buy.The game will be frustrating if you take it too seriously, just remember to laugh it off.			"

I began my day at the hospital by throwing EVERYTHING off my tables. That was my morning until I had lunch. The phone rang so I threw it off the table as well, received an acheivment,I then took control of my ADHD and decided to operate. I then stuck a bunch of needles in my hand and cut my fingers on a huge blade. All of that while the patient is laying with his whole freakin chest wide open and I didn't forget to smack him around as well.WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS? GO BUY IT!

The content here isn't the most accurate when portraying organ transplants, and you won't be using your right hand solely for motion & your left hand solely for gripping in real surgery, let alone perform transplants in both a hospital & ambulance setting.All in all, if you want some silly fun turning an unconscious person into a corpse, go ahead with Surgeon Simulator 2013.

Seeing no other choice, Mr Bean flips the patient off, makes him wear his intestines as a scarf, injects himself with a mystery substance, jams a fork into an electrical socket and passes out in a pool of the patients' blood.

												It seems like one of those games where the controls are so awfully weird, it's there just to screw around and try to do it. But the cool thing is, once you get used to the controls, you can actually try and do procedures as quick as possible.It's nice use of AWER and Space actually feel pretty comfortable and better than something like QWOP. You have a grading system that grades your performance based on how much blood was lost, and how fast you did it. This offers up the way to figure out what tools to use, and when to use 'em. For what music there is, it's nice background noise too. The Team Fortress 2 DLC was a very nice addition, and it makes me think this game also has pretty good DLC potential.			"

												Have you ever fallen asleep on your arm, then woken up to find out that your previously functional arm is now a heavy, barely controllable meat sack, that you have to move around with your other arm?  Have you ever tried to do anything with that arm while it's still dead, like turn off the alarm?  Replace the alarm clock with a patient and lots of sharp implements (and also an alarm clock!), and you have Surgeon Simulator 2013!I bought the game for about the cost of a sandwich, which seemed fair.  I certainly got more fun out of the game than I would get out of a sandwich!edit: Look up the RAGE QUIT youtube video for Surgeon Simulator - it's hilarious, and some of the achievements are based on it.  They seem to be playing an older version (the free version, maybe?), with crazier physics and THE CASUALTY THEME MUSIC!!!

												This is a VERY fun game that is hidden in frustration. At first the game may be very hard and frustrating but once you get the hang of it you can have A LOT of fun with all the different opperations even knowing they're the same three transplants but in different situations such as in the back of an ambulance. There is also about seven total ""special"" operations that require you do do something besides a heart, double kidney, or brain transplant such as the Überheart transplant set in the Team Fortress 2 universe. Have fun oddly transplanting different organs and not putting anything else back inside.			"

												The future of robotic surgery is closer than we think and this game is a tongue-in-cheek take on how tough it actually is to do.  For some people, it will be a fun challenge to grasp the controls and then acclimate them to the environments outside the operating room.  This game is not for everyone, though, so if you feel like you are playing QWOP: You Are Not Alone and The Truth is Out There......in Medical School and Residency, I mean, where actual doctors learn that stuff.

												I was watching some of the major youtubers play this while it was in the beta. I found it quite trivial thinking it'd be like another generic simulator game, being fun at first and getting boring later. That had apparently not become the problem. I had bought this game when it first came out. It was at $15 and I thought to myself, ""Wow, that's bloody expensive! This better be worth it."", and ever since that day it had been the best $15 I've ever spent. This gave me hours of enjoyment and something to relax with even though it may cause a lot of frustration and anger, it's quite relaxing knowing that you go in without any sense of wanting to complete the game for the story (since it has no story). The game is best played in company of others, while others may either see you fail the operation or complete it, it will either make them all laugh or praise you as ""THE GOD OF SURGERY!"". Watching Rooster Teeth's Michael and Gavin play the game together had given me an idea, playing the game with 2 players where 1 controls the fingers and the other controls the arm would make for a great party game or challenge. As it proves the synchroniation between 2 people for the greater humor or the professionality of the pair.With everything said, I would recommend this game to all people who are looking for a game to enjoy with friends and company of other people.

												A touch morbid it may be, but this game does have it's own rather ridiculous charm. It's not something you will grind hours away in but it certainly has potential to keep you entertained. Completing the operations isn't too difficult itself, completing them with half a degree of competency (by game standards at least) is another problem entirely. Half the battle is the controls, with the other half being lack of depth perception. Let's just try and cut tha... oh god please stop bleeding!I don't think it's quite prepared me for a career in surgery, but it has taught me that an axe is perfectly adequate as a medical tool and you don't really need to all your organs to live!

												On first glance appearing as a badly thrown together physics game that simply doesn't work the game will for most people suddenly reveal its genius after significant trial and error.All of a sudden you start noticing the absurd british humour, the subtle (Or not so subtle) political commentary on a view of the British national health service and you start to understand just how the game works and start becoming good at it. To the point where your not just trying to accomplish a heart surgery in the back of a moving ambulance, your seeing how quickly you can do it, if you can do it using only a fire extinguisher and a pair of scissors. Your seeing exactly how much crap you can place in the chest cavity of a patient mid operation and trying desperately to pry a kidney out from some ribs using a plastic spoon.There are plenty of frustrations, due to a niave expectation of how the game 'should' play to the occasional physics bug that can cause your hands or a scapel to get stuck in awkward situations (between ribs, in a fridge [Yes, there is a firdge] etc). Rising above these frustrations and learning from is key to getting the best from this game.This is no game of the year. But it is suprisingly intelligent and funny. Frankly if you don't have it, your missing out on something most people don't encounter very often. A new experience.			"

												It seems like one of those games where the controls are so awfully weird, it's there just to screw around and try to do it. But the cool thing is, once you get used to the controls, you can actually try and do procedures as quick as possible.It's nice use of AWER and Space actually feel pretty comfortable and better than something like QWOP. You have a grading system that grades your performance based on how much blood was lost, and how fast you did it. This offers up the way to figure out what tools to use, and when to use 'em. For what music there is, it's nice background noise too. The Team Fortress 2 DLC was a very nice addition, and it makes me think this game also has pretty good DLC potential.			"

												I would suggest this game to anyone, and I mean ANYONE with half a funny bone in their body (btw, you might have to transplant one in this game XP), this game is just a lot of fun, it is challenging, funny, and each level is unique enough to keep unintersted players going. If you find this game on sale you should buy it, if it is not on sale you should buy it, if the price spikes $50 you should still buy it. It has been a very entertaining game for me (I mostly played it on my friend's computer, I have a total of about 10 play hours with this game) Tip: don't get the regular version, get AE Edition, adds a TON of content: better graphics (way better), new intro, new hallway mode, two new surgeries for each mode, and the soundtrack, in total gameplay it adds a mode and 11 new surgeries for a total of 22 (regular has just 11), Anneversary Edition is way betterI give this game a solid 9.5/10			"

The controls are pretty difficult, but I figured them out pretty well. Surprisingly, I've had most difficulty on the eye surgery. Those eyeballs are hard to pop out of the head. I would reccommend taking a short rage break after losing another patient though. I'm not even halfway done with the game, and I've already gotten the achievment for killing bob within 15 seconds (the drill during the brain surgery is very efficient).

It is difficult to master, but when you finally do, you love it even more. Levels get harder, achievements are rewarding, riddles make you wonder for two days with the whole community... Not to mention the devs are really here for the players, always adding content. A pleasure !EDIT : now can depilate brows & mustache. 11/10			"

You're not going to know what you're going to do, you might be tempted to look up a walkthrough, you might fling all the objects off the table in a fit like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ chimpanzee. But the ♥♥♥♥ing up is most of the fun here, so if you don't like entertaining ♥♥♥♥ups then I guess you need to report to your local Not-Fun office so you can get an Accounting degree or, ideally, get papercutted to death.

												>> Hilarious, yet challenging: BUY IT! <<Ever wanted to be a doctor? But studying 6 years before they let you kill people on the table is too long? Can't wait that long? Well here is your solution: Surgeon Simulator 2013 lets you control  a whole left hand (!) with which to save / end the patients life! If you think you got the hang of it: Forget it, here comes the ambulance operation! If the G-forces of the racing ambulance are a mere joke to you: Forget about gravity, operate in space! And now they have even added Alien operations!This game is really fun to play and really hard to master. The first hour is extremely fun because the game is quite silly. So if it's on sale, go grab it, it's worth a good laugh! Beyond that, you can spend hours trying to improve your performance during operations in terms of blood loss or time elapsed. And there are some other cool achievements to get in this game. For example: Do you think it's hard to flip a spoon 180° and catch it again? Now do it in a clumsy surgeon sim!I honestly can't compare this game to any other game I've played before, but what I can do is recommend you give it a try!Because if you don't like it or your surgery is going ♥♥♥♥ up, you can still let off some steam by taking a hammer and bash your patients skull in! =)			"

												On first glance appearing as a badly thrown together physics game that simply doesn't work the game will for most people suddenly reveal its genius after significant trial and error.All of a sudden you start noticing the absurd british humour, the subtle (Or not so subtle) political commentary on a view of the British national health service and you start to understand just how the game works and start becoming good at it. To the point where your not just trying to accomplish a heart surgery in the back of a moving ambulance, your seeing how quickly you can do it, if you can do it using only a fire extinguisher and a pair of scissors. Your seeing exactly how much crap you can place in the chest cavity of a patient mid operation and trying desperately to pry a kidney out from some ribs using a plastic spoon.There are plenty of frustrations, due to a niave expectation of how the game 'should' play to the occasional physics bug that can cause your hands or a scapel to get stuck in awkward situations (between ribs, in a fridge [Yes, there is a firdge] etc). Rising above these frustrations and learning from is key to getting the best from this game.This is no game of the year. But it is suprisingly intelligent and funny. Frankly if you don't have it, your missing out on something most people don't encounter very often. A new experience.			"

												I was watching some of the major youtubers play this while it was in the beta. I found it quite trivial thinking it'd be like another generic simulator game, being fun at first and getting boring later. That had apparently not become the problem. I had bought this game when it first came out. It was at $15 and I thought to myself, ""Wow, that's bloody expensive! This better be worth it."", and ever since that day it had been the best $15 I've ever spent. This gave me hours of enjoyment and something to relax with even though it may cause a lot of frustration and anger, it's quite relaxing knowing that you go in without any sense of wanting to complete the game for the story (since it has no story). The game is best played in company of others, while others may either see you fail the operation or complete it, it will either make them all laugh or praise you as ""THE GOD OF SURGERY!"". Watching Rooster Teeth's Michael and Gavin play the game together had given me an idea, playing the game with 2 players where 1 controls the fingers and the other controls the arm would make for a great party game or challenge. As it proves the synchroniation between 2 people for the greater humor or the professionality of the pair.With everything said, I would recommend this game to all people who are looking for a game to enjoy with friends and company of other people.

												A touch morbid it may be, but this game does have it's own rather ridiculous charm. It's not something you will grind hours away in but it certainly has potential to keep you entertained. Completing the operations isn't too difficult itself, completing them with half a degree of competency (by game standards at least) is another problem entirely. Half the battle is the controls, with the other half being lack of depth perception. Let's just try and cut tha... oh god please stop bleeding!I don't think it's quite prepared me for a career in surgery, but it has taught me that an axe is perfectly adequate as a medical tool and you don't really need to all your organs to live!

												This is one of those games that you show to your friends, and everyone begs you to let them have a go on it. But the thing is, you don't want to let them have a go because you're too busy hammering away at the patients rib-cage to even notice your friends are in the room. When you've only got a little while to spare, you'll find yourself opening up this game. Whilst the storyline is a little outrageous, the amount of fun that you'll have getting used to the controls and getting stuck right into a heart transplant (warning: contains no medical accuracy, whatsover!) far outweights the outrageousness. The developers have given it a bit of a sense of humor too, even the title menu is a game all in it's self! There's secret missions, and hilarious achievements everywhere, waiting to be found. Just for the love of god, don't drop your wristwatch or a scalpel into the patient, it's a bit of a pain to get back out again.Anyway, usually I'm not a massive indie game fan, but this is utter brilliance. I've seen the price drop super low during the sales for this game, and I bought it myself at the lowest price I've seen yet, but I'd happily pay more than what I already have for this game, and that's saying something!

Did i already mention you smash your patients ribs and skull open with a Hammer?But yeah if you have some time to kill i recommend this game. Keep in mind you need patience it is very hard.

												Ok So all i can say about Surgeon Simulator 2013 is that its a silly little entertaining Simulator where you smash your patients Skull, Ribs, everything open... With a Hammer... But there is more every surgery is diffrent Sometimes u are in Ambulance some times in space.Sometimes the game glitches funny ways examply your drill will get stuck inside your patients ribs and it just makes your patient (named Bob) bleed. Did i already mention you smash your patients ribs and skull open with a Hammer?But yeah if you have some time to kill i recommend this game. Keep in mind you need patience it is very hard. Controls are made to be silly but when you get in the hang of them you are king of the world!I would rate this game...7.50/10			"

												This game may be bloody hilarious, but it is more hilarious than fun! Surgeon Simulator 2013 is realistic, but they worked more on realism than fun. When I first started playing the game, I noticed how clunky the controls were, and how hard it was to even pickup something! It took me an hour to beat the first surgery, and after that, I lost almost all hope in the game when the game crashed at the end of the 2nd surgery! I would not reccomend this game to any type of gamer, unless your a youtuber and your subscribers like laughing well watching your videos! I'd give this game 6/10 score.			"

												I bought this game immediately after i saw the new Trump DLC and Discount, i thought ""Yea, why not, must be hilarious"". For a buck game, really worth your whileIf you're up for cheese and humors, go for itif you have haemophobia,then i'll suggest leave it.The game is pretty simple in idea but very entertaining as a flying hippo(also, guys... don't take this too seriously. It's not what you're looking for if you want to be a doctor, go take a real class)Pros:+Very funny to mess with +Bob has many diseases (which means many variety of surgery)+Tons of levels and difficulty+Feels like a real surgery (it's a simulator, duh)+Feels very british! (better if they had added Tea)+Awesome graphics @ glorious 60FPS [PC Master Race]Cons:-Somewhen the game feels glitchy and minor bugs also present (visit my screenshots for proof)-if you're uneasy with rage quitting, forget the game (some levels like the space and ambulance really takes my time)-If you drop your tools/ organs to right below you hand, that's it. No retrieving it.So, i'll say a yes for a game with many fun features (TF2 surgery is the best part, wait...) go thumbs up for this review so Bob doesn't have any diseases in the future.  "

""The darkest and the most disturbing video game i ever played in my life""You play as Arthur Fischer (aka.

												Not an actual surgeon simulator - just a silly game about trying to perform surgery using only a selection of appropriate and not-so-appropriate tools manipulated by a ridiculously hard-to-control human arm. It's actually quite fun once you get the hang of it, and the surgical procedures are fully do-able. Just don't expect to do a professional job!The game was originally extremely short but has been expanded to include an outer-space mode for its three basic surgeries and an extra set of operations on a space alien in which the organs have ludicrous names and you have to basically guess your way through the alien's unfamiliar anatomy, which is more fun than it sounds.

												Surgeon Simulator 2013 doesn't feel like an actual game nor does it try to recreate surgery within a game. What it does do is add humour in the way that the controls are merely clunky and unforgiving whilst you nervously attempt to carry out surgery. The game itself is funny for about 5 minutes as the character you are controlling is so clumsy that he knocks over everything in his sight but I don't think Surgeon Simulator 2013 is really a game that is intended to be serious. What it does do exceptionally well is try and attempt to put you in a situation where you are mentally instable, drunk and have no idea what you are doing, yet manage to carry out surgery. I wouldn't say that this a game worthy of its £6.99 pricetag seeing as it really is nothing but silliness and a short moment of laughs. I guess it would give good bragging rights if you're able to complete surgery in the fastest time with the least blood lost or whatever but as a standalone game to pay money for? Nope.			"

												Don't go into this game looking for a serious surgery simulator. Go into this game expecting frustration, but lots of laughs to go with it. I actually don't mind failing at this game, it's just so spectacular and rib-tickling(pun intended) when you do. ^_^Oh, and for the best reaction to this game in the history of mankind, go and watch Markiplier's Let's Play of it on YouTube. :)			"

												Surgeon Simulator is what I like to call a novelty game. You know, the sort of game that you buy for a laugh, play it for maybe an hour or two and then forget about it. This is somewhat unfortunate, but inevitable being the sort of game it is since Surgeon Simulator is actually a brilliant idea. It makes fun of itself with the title, it's only barely a ""simulation"" of surgery so if you were actually expecting Trauma Center or something then... no. It's not that. It's more like a skit on Surgery, there's no real tutorial, you're just flung into the surgery room armed with whatever you can pick up, no experience, you just have to perform heart surgery on this poor sap.Of course, once you get into the mindset of ""this is a game about having a laugh"" the game instantly becomes fun, if a little frustrating at time. It all comes down to the control system which is unique to say the least, you use the A, W, E, R, and SPACE keys to control the fingers and thumb of the surgeon's hand, the mouse is used to rotate the hand and move it around the operating area. You have to literally pick up the tools you think you require to operate on your unfortunate victim and use them appropriately, be it a bonesaw, a scalpel, a hammer, whatever.Surgeon Simulator isn't a game that I would pay full price for personally, but it's a great buy in the sales if you want a truly new experience in gaming.

												Surgeon Simulator 2013 is a massively enjoyable indie game and brings a new meaning to the word 'original'. The never seen before gameplay style is a fantastic novelty and matched up against the hilarious content, visuals and audio brings a new experience to gamers which you will no doubt have fun with. The one thing that this game does lack, however, is content. With just a few hours of purely original content available to the player, there isn't a great deal to do. Luckily for the player, the mechanics and style of the game make it such an enjoyment to replay that you can get hours of fun from repeating operations.7/10Pros/Cons+ The uniqueness and outrageousness of the game adds to the enjoyment you'll be having. + The funny, cartoony visuals and audio compliment the tongue-in-cheek style of the game perfectly.+ An incredibly frustrating yet perfectly human control system will both annoy and amuse you.+ Funny achievements (inspired by several online celebrities) will have you in stitches *clap for the pun*. - A few more operations or at least environments would have helped ease the lack of game content.- Having to repeat tough surgeries over and over to progress gets very tedious and stressful.- Don't expect to get too many hours out of this game, just enjoy it for what it is - a unique title.

												You're a disembodied, outstretched forearm with no elbows. Nothing works. You can barely pick up a pencil from a table. What's more, the collision physics either sends things flying or has them slip away, even when you know what to do. That Jurassic Park Trespasser game from years ago already ""blessed"" us with a similar sort of absurd interface as it asked players to kill dinosaurs, so there's only one remaining course of action: perform transplant surgeries with zero in-game tutorials or instruction provided until after you've already succeeded.This is absolutely not something you want to go to Youtube or GameFAQs for instruction on when you're stuck. That'll just ruin the game for you. For SS2013 is a game about screwing things up royally and not really minding too much that you've done so. In fact, most of the ""achievements"" are granted based on ridiculous ways to screw things up, not succeed. For although you're presented with all sorts of tools to go about your task, most of them are either useless or actively detrimental. Normally, this would all make for an atrocious experience. But the ""Simulator"" of the title is a complete and absolute lie. I originally had a paragraph elaborating on this, but the joy is seeing for yourself. Originally made in 48 hours, the ""2013"" version of this game was made in 48 days. The absurd novelty of it all it seems to be part of a slight swell of indie ""perform mundane tasks in goofy fashion"" games. There are 8 operations total, but only 4 unique procedures. Naturally, the toughest one of all--the heart transplant--is what they have you do first!I paid $3.39 for this and got about 9 hours playtime out of it. WORTH EVERY CENT.			"

												For medical students seeking a real-life surgeon simulator look no further.  Clinicals will be a breeze after a few hours fine-tuning your skills.  I would say pre-med students could benefit as well if they poccess enough knowledge about surgery and have a sound medical vocabulary.  This isn't some goofy sim catering to those folks who just want to get a good laugh; it's for those of us who are really striving to make a real difference in the world by being the best damn medical professionals possible.

												A novel kind of fun, this game is an interesting little experience and is fun to watch others try, but doesn't have much in the way of legs (maybe the surgeon cut them off..?). I enjoyed it, but to play it as much more than a novel experience or a game to challenge yourself to obtaining achievements for, you will probably be a bit dissapointed. Regardless, should it find it self on a convincing enough sale, I'd still reccomend it.			"
