												""And down it goes""Bridge building games doesn't look like something that would be that fun at first though. Stick up some pieces without breaking your budget, make sure it doesn't fall apart while a car crosses, and then continue to the next level. Despite this, there are games in the genre that are truly fun, this being one of them. Let me describe why this should be on your wishlist. StorySome crazed maniac has managed to destroy a number of bridges over the region, and now that they need new ones, they grabbed the first person off the street to create them. Despite your lack of experience and skill, you are forced to ensure that companies can still get their goods transported where ever they need to be without letting the drivers lose their lives. Or maybe this has no story at all. Its a bridge building game, we don't need a story. But if you do, just pretend it is the one written above. PresentationThe visuals are pretty basic, but you know exactly what you are looking at, and it has several camera options, including viewing from the vehicles themselves as they plunge over a cliff. Materials will be recognized, and will change colour to show how stressed they are with a toggle option. Sound is also suitable, with metal groaning as it threatens to ruin your hard work, and noises from the vehicles. Not any music in this game though. Not really a problem though. ControlsNice and simple, pretty much everything can be done with just the mouse. Left click will take you through the menu and place pieces of the bridge. Right click is used to remove pieces. Holding the shift key will allow you to select multiple pieces of your bridge so you can copy and paste larger chucks if you want the other side to mirror your current idea. Arrow keys and the mouse wheel can be used to adjust the camera. nothing here to cause any confusion or difficulty. GameplayWorking within the limitations set by your budget and available materials, you will be attempting to build a bridge to cross over various rivers and canyons. These will start simple, with only small areas to build across and only basic materials to make it easy to guess the best choices. As you get further in the game, the bridge will need to be much longer and you will need to mix it up with stronger pieces, cables and even hydraulics so your bridge can lift out of the way of passing boats. Later levels are incredibly difficult as it will seem that you just don't have what you need to prevent the latest travelers from taking a swim, but each of the bridges in the game can be finished. With all the available choices for building your bridge, I much prefer this game over similar titles I've played, none of them matching this for variety. LifespanThe game should last a while. With a tutorial with 3 levels, Easy difficulty with 6 levels, and then Medium, Hard, Complex and Extra each having 8 levels, you have a total of 41 gaps to cross. While there is no sandbox mode as such, there are a couple of cheats available to increase your budget and unlock all materials for that level. As well as all of the included levels, the game includes a menu option to load other levels within the game, though I'm not sure where you may be able to find these additional locations. If you have any interest in trying a bridge construction simulator, this is the game to go for. The most options for building your bridges as well as the ability to load custom levels makes this title the best choice. 8 / 10			"

												What a little gem! This one has been sitting in my unplayed library for months, until a few days ago. Like many, I got it off of one of those cheap sim bundles. There are so many crap simulators flooding the market these days and I figured this one would easily fall into that category. I was wrong. It's actually quite good and alot of fun to play. A short 3 bridge tutorial gets you started on the basics. After that you're on your own.The object is simple. Build various length bridges to support cars, trucks, trains and drawbridges that can allow boats to pass underneath, all within limited budget and material constraints. There are several different bridge types and material types with different costs and construction methods. The game claims advanced physics simulation. I wouldn't know because I'm not a mechanical or civil engineer so alot of trial and error are needed on my part.When you're ready, you press the simulate button and watch how your bridge performs as people drive over it. If you did you're job right, you can move to the next level. Make a mistake and watch the disaster unfold in rather comical fashion. Stress analysis tools and a simulation speed slider help to pinpoint where the failures are occuring so you can beef up construction or use more expensive materials to try and stay together.A neat cinematic camera view and even driver camera makes things interesting, especially if you want to see what it's like tumbling into a ravine because your bridge is poorly built.Definitely recommend for sim fans and engineers.

												Don't let the word ""simulation"" fool you, this is a very clean, pretty, easy to master, yet very challenging puzzle game. I bought it on a whim and regret nothing.While the game may not be visually stunning or incredibly detailed in simulation, this streamlined design ends up working incredibly well for setting the stage for creative problem solving. There is no right or wrong way to complete a level. In fact, every level is open-ended, although it never feels like I'm at a loss for what to do due to a very good difficulty curve, yet at the same time increasingly challenging requirements. Levels are bite-sized, so the game could easily be enjoyed during a short break, and toward higher difficulties requirements and resources tend to vary more and more ensuring that there is no collapse to a single working design.This is not the most graphically gorgeous game, nor does it provide the most extensive simulation, but neither is really needed to properly exercise the brain in the regions other than the overstimulated run/aim/shoot reflexes. And should your destructive needs be overwhelming, there is nothing like collapsing an enormous steel and iron structure, watching the passenger train on top of it plummet to its doom.Well worth the sale price, runs on pretty much any computer, and is a great amount of fun.

												This game is initially quite interesting and fun to play. The easy mode is just that - easy. More like an extended tutorial really. Once you hit medium and hard the challange starts. Build a bridge with a limmited set of parts, on a budget. Have the bridge survive trains, or cars, or earthquakes. Some even have to open hydraulicly for steamboats to pass. Pretty cool to make a bridge on budget, and holds up the train, just to get torn down by the shipping. Where the game starts to fall short is that once played, there is no reset to start over once a bridge is built in a specific challenge, and there are only about 24 challenges in total. I played most in about 3 hours. Further, many of the hardest challenges are indeed not possible to complete as you are tasked to construct a bridge that does not connect to land on one or both sides, and the test vehicle, usually a train, just nose dives off the cliff and the simulation fails. I don't believe these were play tested in advance. Also, you can not build past the budget, and then reduce the design, once you are out of money, no further experiments can be made. Would be a really good $2 or $5 game, but for $19.99 I expected much more.			"

												This game is about building bridges.  You get a set type of materials, from iron bars to steel bars.  Its not to complicated, and is pretty easy to get into bridge building.  The only thing that I had no idea about were suspension cables, but I went through all the maps without ever using it except in a tutorial.  This game would be better if after completing a map it let you go back to it with unlimited funds to build all kinds of crazy bridges.  Due to there being no unlimited mode there isnt much replay value.Things to remmember:*Unticking the autodeck lets you make roads that go up and down, road decks are the toughest material so feel free to use them as supports for the bridge.  *On some maps you can just let the bridge fall in the water if the deck is above water the vehicles wont fall in and you win!   Now your thinking with Bridgets!Rating 9/10  Value:  $9.99			"

												Game has been out for 2 months, and the developer refuses to fix driver related issues. Claims he can't be responsible for driver updates. Chronic Logic [Developer]: ""We can't try and change the game every time a new driver version is released""Do not buy this game if you own a AMD video card as it will fail to launch and probably never will with the developer's mentality.

												Bridge It+ ... a physics based construction game where the object is to span distances using different materials.  You begin the game with only iron then steel.. as you progress through the levels you gain access/unlock more building materials allowing you to span greater distances etc... graphics and lighting are descent in this game, and can be altered without ""waiting for time to change"".  Features such as stress / load / environmental tests are fun to play with.  Triggering a 7.0 earthquake for example is a fun way to usually watch your creation decimated in a split second ιllιlı.  My experience was over-all o.k..  I had some issues with controls/getting click features to respond accurately while building which slowed down the pace of the game.  I don't see much activity regarding updates/patches, and the last ""news"" on the STEAM HUB was posted in NOV2013.  I recommend this game for casual play if you just want to mess around with another ""physics/construction"" game ... BUT at @ half the price it is currently listed for on the Steam store.  "

												It's a fun bridge building game and I find it as the best of Steam in that category.There isn't really a whole lot to say. This game is a pretty traditional and well made bridge builder overall. It has a finished touch with a good user interface and alright graphics. Physics are mostly as they should be, although a few times some trucks fell through the road, but on the other hand those bridges were a bit crazy design anyway. There are some basic levels and then there are challenging ones. Level design can get almost surprisingly clever in some levels.I have a kind of long history with bridge building games and I know when I see a good one. If you have too, Bridge It would be an excellent purchase.			"

												My favorite bridge building game. It is the reason the other bridge building games on steam exist. and they all seem to copy some but not all of the ideas from this game. This game has hydraulics, break points, three different types of steel, 2 different types of suspension cable, it has earthquakes, boats that go under the bridge or through it if you make that kind of bridge, the physics are perfect. basically any feature in this game that you find in another came from this one, but this one still does it the best. Out of the three bridge building games that I have found so far on steam this one is the top. 1. bridge it plus 2. bridge constructor: an effective watered down version of bridge it plus that has lots of levels, plus I think it works on tablets. 3 bridge project: a piece of poop that just cant get anything right, seriously how did this get approved. Just buy bridge it. If you don't know if you like bridge building games get bridge constructor on sale to find out. just don't ever get bridge project.			"

												Before getting into the actual review, I just want to say that this game is amazing! It's 10 years old (I think) but it still holds strong!Now the actual review.Bridge-it is a bridge building game with a really in-depth bridge editor I guess you could call... It has almost every material you normally see in bridges (no wood saddly) and more than enough levels! Pro-Great graphics for the time-Awesome physics-Fun and challenging gameplay-Great replay value-Let you unleash your creativityCons-May get a bit repetitive after awhile. -A bit buggy-A bit overpriced considering it's a pretty old gameOverall, this game is definively a buy! If you like building stuff, it's a must! You might want to wait for a sale though!			"

												Bridge It is about constructing bridges with the use of different materials and a costs cap.  After constructing, a physics simulator shows if the bridge holds up and if cars/trains/boats can make use of it.The game has two major flaws. First, the building interface feels clumsy, deleting items sometimes seem to be bugged and you cannot delete the whole bridge with one button. It requires you to delete all components individually.The second flaw is that there is no feedback about strength, weaknesses and costs of materials. This makes it extreme difficult to understand why bridges fail.All in all, this could have been a nice game, but the lack of proper information and mechanics makes me to not recommend this game.

Strong from attack many Vehicle and Earthquake, wow EPIC!!Graphici can not say for this graphic, very good and real! we can make this game HD, if you see the vehicle, water, and other, is very good, very good, this is perfect simulator game for the graphicSoundfor this game, i think this is make this game is not good, because this game does not sound background, only for sound vehicle, i need sound background for this gameso what i must to say?

												I'm not going to lie, I absolutely love this game. I bought this game a few years ago and it has been one of my best buys. You don't simply build a simple bridge. You can build draw bridges, suspension bridges, heck, you can build bridges that look like women doing yoga. Plus you dont have to just win the approval of measly little cars, you have trains that make your bridge look like it was made of toothpicks. or you can cause an earthquakes to shake it down.

												No level editor, so 'Bridge Construction Set' (BCS), by the same developer, is better. The ""improved"" graphics may be more intensive and pretty, but the GUI is as or more ugly than BCS with less hotkeys (or at least never shown what they are). The levels are generally the same as BCS, without the custom levels that were bundled with it, so DONT buy this for more levelsHydraulics are in it, luckily, but since no level editor, I cant have fun just making ridiculous hydralics contraptions.No reverse hydraulics (pushing out, rather than pulling in), so less functionality, and multi-plane editing seems to not exist, and ive finished up to halfway through 'complex' difficulty levels, so i doubt it will existAs a game, outside of its predecessors, its quite puzzley, and the income is the biggest thing holding you back from completing the levels, limiting who many beams you can build. Theres a limit to selected beam types in some levels, but thats usually rare.Sometimes the physics for cars/trucks is stupid and the vehicle will turn over on a road too steep, when it was fine on the same gradient on a different stage of the level. Its reproducable, so I assume its a slight difference from the hydraulics moving a region back and forth.In BCS, Ive had issues with the split joints (for hydraulic stages) not rejoining when near each other and stalling the level (a failure), but not in this one so far. Not sure if the distance for rejoining has increased or just different bridges, but it has worked well.Options: Very few, only resolution (from a fixed selection), antialiasing, fullscreen, v-sync and low-res textures. No music, and the sound is too loud for my liking, but no volume slider or mute button for that. Had to resort to Windows sound levels. Performance was NEVER an issue, with max options, and normally I run with 0x or 2x AA, but its not an intensive gameConclusion: As a game in the bridge building series by Chronic Logic, its quite disappointing, but as a game in its own right, its a decent puzzle game, with rotary-joint, fixed or suspension beamed, bridge builder simulator game, with few options and no level editor.Go buy 'Bridge Construction Set' from their website. It may be cheaper, maybe not, but it is a better game in every way, with nothing less, except ""fancy"" graphics, which dont help the game			"

												Horrible. I build a bridge then nothing happens and I can't proceed to the next level. Then, when I try to save my bridge the game crashes. How is this even released? This should be a free flash game in beta or something.			"

												Like Bridge Constructor, but not as good. Unlike Bridge Constructor, it also lets you make split bridges with hydraulics which open for boats, however overall doesn't feel as polished or fun. Just get Bridge Constructor.			"

												This game is really well done, and includes many levels to try. It has a nice learning curve so far (I am about half way through medium) and I really appreciate how well overall the game works. Given the time, I will be completing this game a couple of times, in order to work out the best ways for each level.And now you are thinking with Portals!			"

												Bridge It lets you live out your engineering dreams and build super high-tech bridges, you can even use your god powers to simulate earthquakes. It's pretty much my dream game.Watch me play it

												Worst bridge simulator ever. I am a civil engineer for the US government and this game in no way simulates bridge building the way we do it. First of all you need to limit the materilas much more. And then you need to limit everything else. You need to be able to upgrade bridges in a way that saves the government money. You cannot spend money to build bridges. This is just not the way its done in this day and age. Human sacrifices are an acceptable loss that is calculated by a formula and this game does not know it. I cannot share this formula with you or the government will end me, but be sure it exists. Anyway, dont ever expect to get anywhere in life by being good at this game. Save yourself the time and skip it!!!!!!!!!!! Exclamation 1111!			"

												It's one of those bridge building games where you got to build a bridge on a budget. There isn't much to say about this game actually. You build bridges with different materials. Higher the difficulty, harder the task. Eventually you got to make bridges with hydraulics so boats could pass. It's all fun enough to be considered a good bridge building game. There are bad ones out there but this isn't one of 'em.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												As a Bridge master, i feel obligated to tell you this particular bridge game is rather sub-par. It's not bad, it's just old and clunky, so i'd reccomend picking up a different bridge-based title instead			"

												Unplayable, i do not advise playing this the buttons dont wok, the bridge collapses any chance it gets, you play around forever with the girders attempting to place them only to find they don't do what you want!.If they fixed some of these bugs i'd be able to potentially play this but untill then, if a then ever comes its a waste of time and money.

												An excellent bridge building 'simulator' (not sure how realistic it really is) that is well made and perhaps more simulator-like than other bridge-building titles such as Bridge Constructor. It's pretty much the standard affair, with different materials and pieces to use (including hydraulics, suspension, or normal bridge) as well as both rail, motorcar and boat bridges that makes the game varied and interesting. Levels vary in difficulty at a good pace, and you can save bridges or scenarios which is a very useful feature if you've created an especially awesome bridge and want to keep it. Graphics are crisp and enjoyable, and you can rotate around the bridge or view with a cinematic camera bringing a more interesting feel to the game. A feature I also enjoyed using was a first-person view from the car or train or boat crossing the bridge which adds yet another dimension to the game. If Bridge Constructor is a shallow mobile port of a bridge builder, then rest assured this is the real thing. Highly recommended.			"

												Bridge It (plus)เกมสร้างสะพานขนส่ง รถยนตร์ รถบรรทุก รถไฟสร้างสะพานไฮดรอลิค สำหรับให้เรือผ่านสะพานแขวน สะพานสายเคเบิลทนแรงดึงสูงระบบฟิสิกส์ โอเคกว่าเกมอื่นที่มีอยู่ความสวยงามของภาพ อยู่ในระดับดีด้านลบการขับขี่รถของ AI เป็นแบบทื่อๆโง่ๆ ต้องทำสะพานให้มันดีๆ จะขี่ราบลื่นมีบัคในบางด่านต้องทำสะพานแบบลวกๆไป เทสว่ามันครบ เฟสไหม ถ้าครบค่อยทำต่อเพราะถ้าทำไปเยอะๆแล้วรัน บางด่านเรือไม่โผล่ก็มี(เล่นมานานจนเจอครับ) โดยรวมเป็นเกมสร้างสะพานที่ลงตัวที่สุด คุณภาพตามราคาเสียด้านที่จุดยึดมันน้อย ทำให้เป็นข้อจำกัด แต่ข้อดีคือได้ใช้สมองเล่นๆไปก็สนุกดี ครับ เหมาะสำหรับคนแก่ 555 ผมเบื่อเกมที่ต้องคลิกเม้าไวๆแล้วเมื่อยแล้ว			"

												Out of all the sims and how-to games, this one is well put together, ingenuitive, and challanging to play.  I hit a cliff with hard and complex modes, and wish there was a way to skip over parts of the level when I can't figure a certain scenerio out.  But over all Bridge It + takes a setting with very little in the way of tools and comes up with an enjoyable, modest little game of brain-thinky fun.  Recommended for those who like brain games.

												I really enjoyed this game, decent challenge. I picked it up during a x-mas sale, so it was a good value. I don't see any way of getting additional challenges for the game, thus I'd say the normal price is a bit much. Overall very fun game though, and definately worth checking out the demo.			"

												Playing this game for about half an hour and i realize there is much MUCH more to be improved. I like the idea, But, Really, I think it needs to be a little more optimized. This runs worse than modern warfare 2 on a 7900gs. Would still recommend this game			"

												I have fallen in love with this game.  It came as a complete surprise to me.  It came in the simulation bundle from Bundle Stars, and it was a small file size so I installled just for fun and gave it a try.  Skip 4 hours and I'm still playing and becoming obsessed with passing every challenge.  I recommend this game to everyone who likes building/engineering games.  You won't regret it.			"
