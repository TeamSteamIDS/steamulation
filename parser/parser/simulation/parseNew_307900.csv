												Very good game! I really enjoyed it! Anyone who loves animals, the ecosystem and a good, a bit complex and difficult economy/strategy/simulator/magement game to play or have kids and wants to play something on the PC with them should buy this game as soon as possible and buy the whole collection!PS: You need to own Wildlife Park 2 to play but for the Missions/Quests  & Different Starting Screen to appear you need to launch the according game icon, for example for Marine World Missions you need to launch Marine World but for Wildlife Park 2 you need to launch Wildlife Park 2. Whatever the case they will both share the animals so you will still have marine world animals in the Sandbox mode of Wildlife Park 2 but not in all the missions of Wildlife Park 2.			"

												The Wildlife Marine World I think is probably my favorite from the bundle that I bought of all the wildlife games.It has all the normal animals that you find plus more marine creatures and I think a Mermaid that costs 25000000 lol of whatever money it is in these worlds.You also get to set out a scuba diving scooter and a  submarine to keep your visitors happy.It's a lot of fun if you don't want anything too taxing and your in a creative mood.  :) "

												Four people decided to swim in my reserved ocean sanctuary. With sharks. In the middle of the ocean. With all their clothes on. ""Grandma 2"" feels there is not enough scenary 20 miles out in the ocean, and is carrying 1.7k cash on her. Best game of its time. "

												Adds marine related missions aswell as new environments and all sorts of lovely animals. Creating a special marine zoo is rather theraputic. I like to imagine the fishies as businessmen and the sting rays as mobsters. Makes things more exciting that way.			"

												Didn't bother reading any of the tutorial... but I was soon rewarded with numerous dead turtles generally floating around the place.If you pick it up for only 2 dollars like I did then it's not too bad for a dodgy sim/sandbox/etc game.			"
