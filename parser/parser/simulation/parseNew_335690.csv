												Duplicity takes place, as many of these titles do, in a high school in Japan. There you step into the shoes of Yukina Kudou: a seemingly frail girl who in in a relationship with the school’s idol: Youji Kataoka. However she is actually a spy sent by the school’s principal and noted geneticist, Dr. Kouichi Serizawa, to monitor Youji who is actually a clone of the good doctor. As Yukina continues in her job she also begins to unravel the mysteries surrounding her mentor as well as herself.On the offset this looks like just another boy chasing game and to be fair there is a romantic element to Duplicity. However, it’s so dialed in its hard to point to as anything worthwhile. Each romantic subplot is predictable, the guys don’t stand out and by the end of them any relationship you achieve feels more like the runner-up prize to the actual story. This isn’t a knock on Duplicity from where I sit, since what the story pushes in its place is more psychological narrative surrounding the plot hatched by Dr. Serizawa. That isn’t to say that the actual plot is perfect by any stretch of the imagination. Roseverte tries something bold in this realm by focusing instead on a pseudo psychological thriller targeting girls. It has more than a few rough spots that leave you lost in translation, especially when you’re grinding but more on that later. Also it can get downright preposterous when you think about things like a massive genetic lab underneath a high school ran by the super wealthy, world-renowned scientist principal. And just as the romances are predictable, the keen observer will be able to figure out Duplicity’s mysteries in no time flat.These aren’t superheroes and they are far from ideal. As the title suggests they’re all wrapped up not only in their own lies but in the lies told by one another. The road to discovering the truth is what makes each character stands out and I was surprised by just how much I cared for their mental and physical well-being by the end. Not only that, but it raises some interesting questions on familiar romance and sci-fi tropes as you’ll see when the full scale of Dr. Serizawa’s  choices.As for our heroine Yukina really stands out. Every path in one way or another backhands her with the uncomfortable reality that the men she can develop feelings for are nearly damaged beyond repair. And again, being fair to Duplicity, her actions are true to life and make her a much stronger character than what you would expect from other otome heroines. Similar praise goes for the handling of the men around Yukina who are all equal balance of broken and resolute.Presentation is…er…I don’t know how to put it actually. It’s like a watercolor anime style that I haven’t seen before today and most likely will never see again. What would normal be bright and vivid colors for all involved are usually muted and dialed back as far as humanly possible. This also leaves the character sprites in a very odd position: often looking like their expression was melted into their skin and poses poses that are often, to put in nicely, impractical.This is abundantly clear in the special event CGs that are hit and miss for the large part. Outside of that the backgrounds perfectly fit the watercolor feel of the art and the soundtrack actually mixes in nicely with the scenes playing out in front of you. Duplicity doesn’t have an offensive presentation by any means, but it is an acquired taste.Duplicity clocks in at about seven hours total to unlock all fifteen endings. This time can be cut down if you focus on just the good endings of the five different routes. Ultimately what it boils down to for this particular title is if what the VN delivers is worth its 14,99€ price tag and for me at least the answer is…no. Unless you’re a perfectionist and enjoy grinding away to get every little thing a game has to offer, once you knocked out the major endings of Duplicity that’ll be it. It’s definitely good for a full play through at least to experience the overall story, but wait until Roseverte holds a sale to feel you got your money’s worth.Duplicity is an odd game. It doesn’t do any one thing extraordinarily well, yet at the same time it stands pretty well on its own. While its weaknesses are noticeable, there is still a lot of fun and thinking tied into Duplicity that will entertain otome fans while serving as a nice distraction for the atypical EVN player. Overall 6/10. "

												I ended up getting the worst ending on my playthrough and quite frankly, I was glad to be over with the game. This is a game that has a great concept and drags it out in the longest way possible. All you are basically doing is grinding points and hoping that the story will progress, which it rarely does. At least in a meaningful way.What I likedStoryI liked the concept of the story. You're introduced to the plot-twist quite early on and it makes you want to find out how things will end. Because the concept is quite odd.What I dislikedGrindingBetween the scenes where you actually progress on the story, you are forced to grind stat points. I hate this and the status screen isn't shown all the time, so if you have a bad memory like me, then you'll be going back and forth to keep track of the stats. Also the stats are not displayed in numbers, which becomes a problem as the story expects you to progress to a certain amount of point. The grinding aspect have the same dialogue, same pictures and you're basically clicking stuff hoping it'll go according to what the game asks you. Boring!PaddingIt's obvious that the story is intentionally trying to drag out as much as possible. So I am asked to observe a guy and see if there's any changes. Yet all these characters do is having some superficial talk and perhaps walk three steps together. Boring! It takes forever to get any form of plot development that matters.			"

												This first otome visual novel from roseVeRte feature a female protagonist Yukina Kudou, a student attending Serizawa High School with her best friend Nao and a fellow classmate Youji Kataoka. At the school, Yukina became the assistant to the school principal and her foster father Kouichi Serizawa with a strange request to become Youji's girlfriend and report on Youji's actions to Kouichi. Over a period of 3 months, Yukina (and the player) will manage her studies and relationship with Youji and Kouichi by listening to gossip, studying, monitoring Youji, helping Kouichi and resting. Yukina may develop a relationship with Youji or with Kouichi which could lead to a love, good or bad ending and might shed some light on Yukina and each character's past as well as their motivations and true intentions. In subsequent playthroughs after reaching some endings, Yukina may start to gain additional information by listening to gossip and studying, as well as the arrival of a transfer student Rei Anderson where Yukina may also develop a relationship and have a good or bad ending.The game has an in-game link to a guide on roseVeRte's website to help players in reaching all endings and get all achievements, plenty of save slots to allow different gameplay and dialogue choices to be made during the game, Yukina's skill gauge and heart icons appearing in each character's portrait to help players with the stat management part of the game and the option to skip and fast-forward any part of the game. Background music and overall game presentation are great after factoring in chibis for each of the main characters, animated snowflakes and appropriate background music to match most settings and characters. Highly recommended when at discount or in bundle offer as it takes less than 10 hours to reach all endings and unlock all CGs and achievements.			"

Pros:Story & Characters: The story is interesting and different, which I really enjoyed. It didn't automatically take me to where I expected. I also enjoyed the personalities of the characters. They seem flat at first but as you progress through the routes you learn that there's more to all of them than you first realized, which is what it's generally like interacting with people when you first meet them. You see the surface then you keep going and see what's really going on.Neutral:Art: The art is also different. It's not purely on the anime style so many VNs are released in, but it's not completely separated from that either. This is purely a matter of taste. For me it simply didn't bother me. I've played both VNs with better and worse and enjoyed them regardless because what else it brought me. If I disliked it when I played it (which was way before it got released on Steam) then I got used to it through playing the game. I could understand if the art appeals to some but not to others though.Stat Raising: Personally I don't like stat raising, but that's not a deal breaker for me. I'd say as for difficulty goes it's about average compared to most stat raising VNs I've played (Dandelion: Wishes Brought to You, Nicole, Magical Diary, LRR, Flower Shop, Scheherazade, various NaNoRenO games, probably others). Usually the story and dialogue I get is worth getting through the stat raising. Is it in this case? I'd say yes, it's worth it. I read mention in another review that you can't see your stat screen to know where you're at, which isn't true. While you can't pull it up at any point in the game when it comes time to actually deal with stats there's a ""Show Status"" button at the bottom that pulls it up so you can make an educated decision, no memorization required.The problem comes in that the requirements for specific endings are so particular and narrow that without using a walkthrough you're likely to miss. This isn't necessarily a problem with the stat raiser as it is the inner mechanics of the game.Walkthrough: I'd say you should use one for this game, especially if you want to complete everything. I don't care if I use a walkthrough or not, but if you want to be able to do everything yourself it's probably going to frustrate you. That's something to keep in mind when deciding if this game is for you.Cons:15 Endings: Usually I'd be all for all the endings, but in this case I feel like they were dragging it out unnecessarily. There didn't need to be 15 endings and I felt that. I liked the story but it didn't need to be stretched out. Some of them are difficult to find without the use of a very clear walkthrough. I like to complete every inch of the game, so if it tells me I'm missing endings I'm hunting them down, but some of them could have been left off the list even if they're technically an ending because they really don't offer anything to the story.Conclusion:Was this game worth playing for me? Yes. It's interesting. It's unexpected. Are there problems? Yes, and if some of the things that didn't bother me bothers you than it may not be worth it. Ultimately though I'd say I would wait for a sale or a bundle. For the price there are other VNs that I'd buy over this. But if you see it on sale or in a bundle? (Or if you're like me and have already run out of options?) Then I'd say go for it.			"

												It's way too repetitive. Obviously I am not saying that about the gameplay, lol. More so in the actual dialog. The only changes are within the events of the story progression. Otherwise everything else is exactly the same. To me it's a major buzz kill. Which makes going through the game a second time even harder... considering how short the game is in general. The story is a bit different than your average visual novel, but in the end you're still forcing yourself through the same content just to see progression. I say no to this game, but if you still want to try it then I suggest not playing in long sessions, because it becomes tiring really fast.			"

												Indie visual novel.Follow the mostly simple choices to simple ends. The story... Well... Without giving anything away, all I can say is it is typical of the genre. I found it a bit creepy, which it probably is not supposed to be, and incestuous. As you play through the story remains mostly the same with just a slight change of the lead beau.The sound was the highlight at first and it is a shame they did not include more songs. The graphics; backgrounds good, avatars okay for the most part, here and there it does lack and in one scene there is a proper unintended derp face.I am not a massive fan of the genre and this game has done nothing to convince me. I will forget this game quite quickly.  I got in one of the four bundles it has so far appeared in and I feel it really does not fit the £11 price tag or even half that.			"

												I must say, i quite enjoyed this game. Although the plot is pretty much easy to guess after doing only one route, it's still fun to play through them all and see various viewpoints of the same story. Which is, in my opinon, fairly interesting and original. Enough to stay in my memory for some time, i think.Characters were... okay, i guess. I don't think they were very memorable or unique, and i have neither negative nor positive feelings towards them. They fullfilled their role, and that's what matters.As always art leaves mixed feelings because it's not very good, but at least it is consistent and nothing stands out too much. I am also quite a fan of colouring, it looks really good.Music was a big plus, it really is very nice. To sum it up, personally i recommend this game.I had a couple of hours of fun with it.			"

												I don't understand why dUpLicity begins with a simulation game. It's dull, tedious stat grinding, and you're thrown into it before you even get a proper introduction to the story and characters -- i.e., the reason you might put up with such obvious padding. I guess if you've played the original freeware version[roseverte.net] of the game you'd be familiar with the basics, but Beyond the Lies is a separate game and should be able to stand on its own.Once you get past the simulation part, the game turns into a proper visual novel for each character route. You have to replay and see all the routes and endings -- including an unlockable route -- to understand the whole story. Honestly I thought it was pretty mediocre at first, and was mostly playing to get this game off my backlog. But once I got to the true route (about an hour and a half into a game that takes 3-4 hours to fully complete), I started to really enjoy the story.I'd say if you're an otome fan who can forgive a slow start and don't mind using a walkthrough[otome-addiction.tumblr.com] for the simulation game, give this a try. It's not a very romantic game, but it explores some interesting themes.			"

												I found myself really enjoying roseVeRte’s games. This one shares a few things with their other games: the art isn’t so good (which is okay because the story IS GOOD. At least it’s way better than a lot of other VNs around here), and there’s a plot twist. I must say, I found this story rather intriguing; not sure if in a good way tho… But I played all the routes to make sure I wasn’t missing anything. To be really honest, I thought that it was kinda creepy the relationship between Yukina and Kouichi. I’m not a fan of “replacements” (you know, when someone dies and the other person keeps seeing their deceased beloved one on this new person) so that must be why I didn’t enjoyed his route so much. But that’s just me, other people might like it.6/10. It was an interesting experience for me, and I recommend getting this game on sale.			"

												I really don't understand the plethora of negative reviews this title has received. It's a run of the mill stat-raising, time management VN. It is true that it can be a bit arduous when played in long sessions so I'd suggest playing for a bit and then taking a break and coming back. The story is unique and caught me slightly off-guard, something that I welcome with the current types of VNs on the market. It's definitely out of the ordinary and repetitive but I would suggest that if you are a VN fan and don't mind the stat-raising (choosing which actions to take on certain days that affect the outcome of the game) I'd say to pick this one up and see how it fares in your opinion. Don't be dissuaded by the negative reviews...pretty sure that many of those were written by people who are unfamiliar with this genre.			"

If you like otomes should play this game too :)For better recommendation for game read post from CallistaWhite - after reading this recommendation I bought this game and I do not regret.thx CallistaWhite :)			"

""Rest or study?"" Decent VN with 4 different routes and many endings. Quite not that horrible like the East Tower series. You are a female student at university involved into an study experiment. For 3 consectuive months you can decide daily if you want to study/rest/develop relationships. Then comes a short epilog of 3 chapters which clearsup all the endings. Will you reveal the true story or just keep on resting all the time?


What a choice

												This game shows. That many bad reviews say nothing about quality. Yes the quality of the screens is not so good like the best, but i think it could be 5,5-5 of 7 billion never reach this points of artist skills. Its has is own charme and dont feel like a mass product. Next the way is not so funny only few days you can read really of 90 days, sure weekends are done fast choice 2 things and rest you only need to find out what you need to get to the chapters and read the few important story parts but good you can use fast forward most time but then comes a special moment and get to far in it and you wish to go back some sides. Thats the weak point of this game, you cant go back some sides. So then you go further and hope you get the right combination of hearts and maybe wisdom to get in the chapters and make their the right choices. After a few tries you learn to focus what you need and if not you can use one of 4 epic guides each person ending you search.The sound is like always in VN sufficient very few even a bit satisfying - good, but decide yourself watching material, but its not very important.If you like games or VN you want a good story like in books or movie and this one is brilliant. I never saw such an idea in any media, but for the most people it will be boring, but they should buy/ play VN! Not even for achievement, that think romantic games are for woman only or OH NO, NO FEMALE B...s.Spoiler!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: The story is a genius works hard, find a girl he love, she has a weak heart, they oversleep because they are workaholics, they get under a avalanche, she died, he survive but has now a weak heart too, get depressive and little bit insane, use forbidden cloning to get her back, but since he has only a few years he clone himself to protect her, the details and the rest (TRUE ENDINGs) you can find out yourself and their is a 3rd man (very mysterious). So who get the girl and who is her best friend and what is really behind all this story? Buy the game and play it.So this game has many walks to get to different chapters at the end you can get for both mens 4 endings and then 2 true ending that tell some other details and then last extra has 3 endings so you can get i think 13 endings if their is not even 1-2 normal endings too. Not all would be needed, so maybe skip some of it, because they telling nothing or to less new so in the end maybe 7-9 could do it too.If you skip something, some of the CG you can reread in the extras.A good story is all i need if you think other then DONT BUY/ PLAY THIS GAME! If you want something critic then your own wrong decision, not the developers. You can warn other players but dont ruin this little hard work with imprudent ignorance this game -.-The story gets 97% because i have seen much and i personaly get not so suprised since long time with a good movie, book or game like this one.So if you are a VN fan and dont need super graphics or 10 hours game, i give this game 95%, if you are not a fan or hate them, then dont buy  this game please. I play this game now a bit of 6 hours because i stuck at the start a bit to get in the chapters maybe some get trough it in 4-5 hours if they dont skip the cutscenes and read all story full but fast so decide your price. I would say the game is a non aging game and getting it for 50 % or higher (66-75-80)discount is fair to the developer to support hopefully another good tale and the player has something of it (ONLY FOR VN GENRE LOVERS!) A-Hunters should be happy with cheapist price and support the developer with money and positive reviews OR NON! for many more 100 % free games. Thank you for reading and enjoy life with gaming :)			"

												I've meant to write a review for this game for a while now. I really was disappointed in it even after I was able to manage to get some of the endings. I wasn't eager to get all or even most of them but the happy ones at least.When I first played it I was done with it in a matter of minutes. Disappointing given the fact that I'm used to much better games from roseverte but not only that but it's really to expensive for that. I either expect a hella good game or at least more playtime. I got neither. The dialogues are basic and dull. If you played the East tower series you'll might remember that the dialogues there were quite simplistic too but it wasn't bad because all the games had a special kind of cuteness to them. I can't claim the same thing about d'UpLicity. It wasn't emotional or cute, it wasn't intriguing or anything like that. Reading all these dialogues with these impersonal characters was just exhausting and frustrating.The gameplay is boring and stupid and not challenging at all (those dayplanner features tend to be repetitive but other visual novel producers manage to do interesting stuff with it). You didn't have to think ahead you just had to choose the same action over and over again. The hints what thing you had to say were so obvious and aaargh... This is - in my opinion at least - the worst game rosevert ever produced. There actually isn't much left to say now. The art isn't as bad as most of the people in the reviews claim it to be. It's most definitely not breathtakingly good but it's unique and alright to look at. If the story was good it wouldn't be even worth mentioning. Can't recommend it.			"
