Early Access Review
								*UPDATE 12-24-2016* Well looks like Red Level Games is avoiding steam at all costs, with no updates to the game I would call this game development dead.  Apparently the devs are still updating people on Kickstarter (But I haven't heard of any builds being updated) so now my only guess is Red Level Games are trying to save face.  So looks like Dragon the Game is just another failed Early Access story.  Just add it to the pile.TL;DR version:Kickstarter campaign has (expensive) stage walls for some of the features below.  Game hasn't really improved in a year.  To my disapointment, it's to risky to pay 18 dollars.   Long version:I purchased this game the first day of release, I wanted the final product to be a decent indie game.   Sure it would have flaws but it would be enjoyable at least.  When I first booted up the game boy was in for a surprise... not for how far along the team was in developing this game, instead for how little and broken everything was; flying was awful, the camera was confusing to use, there was little to do, and everything about the visuals was just ugly.  At first I figure; this game is in early development and it's just needs more work, no worries I'll just watch it develop over time.  However over a year later and I would be lying if I said things got better.  Sure they did add some new NPCs, some new sturctures.  However flying is still broken, the scale of your dragon to the world seems off, and the game doesn't feel anymore improved.  So normally I would brush this game off as a bad purchase and I would have learned a lesson, or maybe still give the dev team the benefit of the doubt.  I honestly don't know that much about game development, so maybe there is more stuff under the hood they are working on that we just don't see yet.  The main problem for me is.  Even after being on the Steam store for over a year.  Red Level Games has decided to start a campaign on Kickstarter.  (To be honest I think they are the only ones to have started on Steam, then moved to Kickstarter.  I know the reverse happens or maybe even they launch at the same time)  It seems really strange to me.  I know games cost money to make, you need to keep people employeed in order to work on a game, you also need a place for them work.  I get it and I don't care that they have this campaign of the side for people who want to help some more.  My real issue is, some of the features listed below (As of the date of writing this review) are now suddenly blocked off by a stage wall.  Even though their Kickstarter Goal is 30K some of the features such as; adding more Dragon body types/species is a 750K milestone on their Kickstarter. I don't know what Red Level Games was thinking.  This game isn't really popular, it isn't really drawing the attention needed for a Kickstarter to get the majority of it's milestone/stages funded.  It's only popular in a niche market, so the people who would have been willing to donate to the kickstarter probably have already purchased the game and even a smaller percentage of them will  be willing to give even more of their money to this project.After this Kickstarter I'm now worries on the progress that will be made here.  I feel like it would be a huge risk to anyone now to spend 18 dollars on this game.  However all of this could work out, the game gets finished and it's amazing.  I would be so overjoyed and woul gladly admit I'm wrong.  It's just from where I'm sitting right now... I don't have high hopes.			"

Early Access Review
								I understand that this game is in early access, but I don't know if it's worth the money. I'm glad I spent it so they can work on it some more, but I'm having doubts. This game definitely has a cool idea, but it's not quite ready for anyone to play right now. In fact, there's almost nothing to do but fly around. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the dragon concept, but I don't know if they have a good enough foundation to get this off the ground (I made a pun because the dragon can barely get off the ground). Here are some ideas to make this game awesome:1. Better flight controls - It's very clunky and full of bugs. I found this nifty little nook on the top of a mountain and I tried to get to it, but my dragon kept falling backwards for some reason. No idea why. I would like to see something like Zelda: Skyward Sword. The birds in the game had very simple, but easy to use flight controls. Flap the wings, they'd go up. If you were high enough, you could coast on the ""wind"". I'm not looking for realistic, I'm looking for fun.2. Better ground movement - Dragons are mythical creatures, so I can't never know for sure...but I'm fairly certain that they aren't supposed to move like that. Also the body of the dragon doesn't interact well with the ground, and I'd like some motivation not to crash my animal into the ground. So far, the only way that's possible to land your dragon from high up is to do a death spiral to the ground. 3. More interesting landscape - I get that they are trying to be realistic, but I'd almost prefer if they focused more on mechanics and less on landscape. Plus, the mountains are kind of boring at this point. In the future, I'd like to see snow on top of them, and forests so thick with trees that it is almost impossible to land among. Also, rivers and lakes.4. Dragon Territory and Hoard- I think the game makers are going for a territorial/combat/choose your destiny kind of game. I'd like to see some caves where I can store all my treasure and princesses. 5. Better dragon customization - enough said. I'm glad I have an option to explore as a silver dragon, but I'd like a little more detail than that. Once again, I understand that this is a work in progress. But they aren't moving very fast and I don't know if they have the foundation for this to succeed. I will remain hopeful, however. So buy the game if you can afford it, but think of it like a donation right now because it's not much of a game at all currently.			"

Early Access Review
								Lets start with the EULA(link at the bottom of this review) I Highly recommend you read it before buying this game. After the recent kick starter campain, I know see how the Dev's word things is how they mean it:""When connected to the Internet and using Dragon: The Game, RLG may receive information including by not limited to your hardware MAC address, internet protocol address, and your usage of various game features""They go into saying it is ""annonimously"" taken then you read the rest:""The information collected by RLG may be posted by RLG on publicly-accessible web sites, shared with hardware manufacturers, shared with platform hosts, shared with RLG's marketing partners or used by RLG for any other lawful purpose"" so how could this be taken annonimously if they are going to have a record and want to share it? Oh but my favorite line is:  RLG does not guarantee that your information will not be disclosed to third parties.This game was green lit/Early Access November 14th 2014 (which you all may want to look up the guidelines for early access), then January 2016 to Febuary 2016 they had a kick starter, saying they sound their house and vechiles for this game to come into being. Puzzeling how they started to back two other games during their raising of money.I am fully convinced what you pay for here is ~NOT~ the same game that those who paid into the kickk starter are playing (though the dev's are pleading with everyone to come here and leave a positive comment, getting other people to pay for a unplayable version. This is strenghtened by the EULA stating  ""At some point in the future Dragon: The Game may go out of date, and RLG makes no commitment to update Dragon: The Game..My Advice? God be with you if you want to buy this game.http://store.steampowered.com/eula/305960_eula_0 "

Early Access Review
								******DISCLAIMER******** I don't recommend this game for specific groups of gamers. Please read the full review for my thoughts! thank you!This game is difficult for me to review, and I'll explain why. I have dreamt of this game concept for YEARS. I have told all my friends about this ""idea"" I had about a game where you played AS a dragon. Where the game was a mix of RPG/Action/Strategy/Open World/Co-op and PvP. A game where you started off as a baby dragon, heading out into the world. You would set up a lair, and then proceed to level up and grow as you saw fit. Maybe you'd be a typical giant red dragon breathing fire on all the nearby villages. Or you could be a diplomatic dragon who forged alliances with humans instead. Each level would allow you to customize and upgrade various aspects of your dragon. Etc...I could go on all day about my ideas (Been thinking about them for years as I mentioned.) Reading the description from the developers, this game COULD potentially BE my dream game, finally realized.On the one hand, I want to enthusiastically recommend this game so more people will support it and it can grow into the game of my dreams. However, I have to be honest and tell people what they are getting into before they spend their hard-earned money. I have barely started the game up, and quit after a minute or so because the controls were so un-intuitive and I couldn't figure out how to switch them. The graphics were poor, and no amount of messing with the settings would improve them. Obviously this is still in early access, so there is still hope for lots of improvement. With such a limited amount of experience in the game, I can't talk about any of the deeper mechanics, etc...but the small amount I did experience was hard to endure. I am planning to not ask for a refund in the hopes that this game will continue to grow and adapt into a game I can love. I bought it on sale for $15 ish, normally it goes for $17.99 I think. If you love dragons like I do (and like the developers, from the sound of it) this game could very well be worth supporting. If you're kind of ""meh"" on the subject of dragons, maybe wait a few months before purchasing.I will continually check up on this game and revise my review as time goes on. Thank you for reading!END OF OFFICIAL REVIEWTo the developers: (if they read these things...)Thank you for doing this game! As I mentioned, I have pictured this game in my head for 10+ years now! I always toyed with the idea of submitting it to some developer, but figured it'd already been discussed and dropped, of that there wouldn't be much interest. Every few years, I'd do an internet search for ""dragon games"" to see if there was by chance a game that somewhat matched my ideas. None ever have until now! Happened upon your game in a STEAM sale and bought it pretty quickly. I understand that this game is a side endeavor for all of you, outside of your regular jobs, so it can't be your main focus. All I ask is that you do what you (reasonably) can to make this game great! I could die a happy man if this game is able to fulfill even some of my grand dragon aspirations. Again, thank you for undertaking this project.			"

			Early Access ""Dragon: The Game"" with its most recent update, after over a month of silence and making its Kickstarter (and getting funded) The Kickstarter:...		

This video says it all.I started like em all. I saw a game about dragons and instantly bought it, because I felt it needed support.Do not give these devs money. Don't purchase the game in its current state.They had a kickstarter, a successful one that granted them 35k dollars and they presented a new dragon model, along with promising to have weekly updates on their progress. The last time we heard from them was in April and now it's June.I wouldn't be so upset, if they at least did keep us up-to-date on their progress, but they don't. And I am starting to feel like they never will.			"

Early Access Review
								Magnificent idea, without a doubt. A game where you take the role of a dragon for no greater reason other than to do dragon-y things. That's really the kind of game i'm craving these days.That being said, i cannot in any way recommend this game in it's current state. This is VERY early access. Like, SUPER early access. It runs like a snail through molasses(very slowly) on my somewhat competent computer, and there are glitches in the most noticable of places, like that one where your dragon gets stuck tilted at a 45 degree angle from the ground.Of course, the biggest issue here, the one that really bothers me the most, is that none of the dragons movement feels especially dragon-like, with the arguable exeption of the flying. There is no weight to any of your movement, the fire breath carries all of the force of shining a flashlight on things, and all in all, in it's current state, the game ultimately fails to deliver on the one thing it tries to be: a dragon simulator.I hope, i truly hope by the grace of the moon that this game becomes something grand. And when it does, i swear i will shower it with all the praise i can muster. For the time being, though, i'm just waiting for this thing to become decently playable.Oh, the curse of early access games...			"

Early Access Review
								I've owned this game for maybe 2 years, and it's still an utter piece of crap. Slightly different crap than what I originally bought, but still utter turd. I bought this game, as many others did, because this is a concept I've always been looking for in a video game. This game does not deliver on that. Dragon: The Game makes a lot of promises, and fufills none of them. Its unplayable, it's ugly, and little to no progress has been made in its development. Frankly, its gone backwards. When i first played, the UI actually worked, to a degree, and I could atleast run the game. Now many of the buttons do literally nothing when I press them, and I immediately crash a few minutes into 'gameplay'. Don't buy this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Best indie game since Notch's most famous of games, the mighty Cliffhorse, whose release rocked the indie world. It's like Cliffhorse, but WITH DRAGONS!All jokes aside, it's pretty barebones at the moment, and I knew it would be when I bought it. Don't buy it if you're not prepared to play a seriously early alpha build game. I am gonna recommend it, because I have been waiting for this game and would like to believe the developers will continue to the end. But there are some problems.- Dragon creation screen is broken. Can barely see dragon and most of the features appear unimplemented.- Multiplayer stuck me in an endless loop of connecting and freezing then reconnecting.- I deleted the dragon named New Dragon, and now the Dragons button no longer works so the game is unplayable. Exit button also broke.- If you kill a peasant they bleed and bleed until the game freezes.- Launch option doesn't work. You must go through the options pop up first.(I could not care less about that last one, but worth noting.)Again, do NOT buy this game expecting a finished game, but do buy it if you are willing to trust the developers to finish it properly, or if you're just really in need of a dragon simulator.

Early Access Review
								First off, following what everyone else has said, this game is in a very early release stage. There are multiple glitches, including but not limited to controls, clipping, humans dying in an excess amount of blood crashing the game. There is basically nothing to the game at this moment. It is a skeleton, and in my opinion, a little too bare for early access even. That being said, I am loving this game. I am a bit bias in this, but flapping the dragons' wings to barely make it over that mountain peak, and the gliding down the side at increasing speeds was a joy. The controls are intuitive and are leagues above majority of the dragon flight games I have played, some including Lair, and Divinity 2, and multiple others that I do not remember the name of. I recommend this game for dragon lovers alone at this moment, who just want to fly around. I have very high hopes for this game, and I do recommend keeping your eye on this game if you do not buy it now.			"

								Going by my profile picture, this has been on my wishlist for quite some time. And due to the Winter Steam Sale, I decided to get it. Though I do hope my investment helps with their continued development of this game, because wow.. does it need it.I'll be 100% honest with you. If you love dragons as much as I do, and you pray this small development company can deliver, then invest and enjoy the game as-is. But realize, this game is only a whelp right now. It just needs some time to grow.And like the typical age of a dragon, it will take a pretty long time until this game will be what I want for this. This game has been in Alpha for over a year. Thankfully the dev team haven't abandoned it, giving me hope it will be as epic as a dragon should be.			"

								This game is sadly not worth it in it's state right now. The point of Early Access was pretty much missed.If this was a free Demo or something like that I'd be super hyped, but in it's current state I'm kind of depressed. My brother couldn't even properly run the game while it's graphics are really bad at the moment.I will update this review when the state of the game changes and it actually becomes at least worth part of it's price!You should really reconsider putting a game onto Early Access when pretty much every free flash game you find on Armorgames or Kongregate or such sites is more fun to play. And just look at this games price right now, you get the actual game and a promise that it'll be way better. But why not buy 2 excellent games from that money and this one later?My conclusion: Track this game's updates but don't bother buying if you want to properly play as a dragon. You pretty much can't. There's barely any content.Edit: I don't understand the many negative votes on this review. If anythings wrong please add a comment so I know what is wrong.			"

Early Access Review
								**Updated 4-1-16**The last time i played this game was 11-7-14. At that time it was little better than a tech demo.I have redownloaded the game. This is my new impressions.I'm going to compare what was, to what is now:(Note, i played on ""good"" setting for graphics).The UI prior - Seem to be well made for the starting screen where you pick your dragon/map and hit the play button. The background was equally nice. Over all, I liked it. When picking your dragon you could look at stats and what could be skills/powers. Detailed, very easy to read. This alone I'd say was very well put together and awesome at that.The UI now - The starting screen where you pick your dragon. First impression... Green neon grass/ground. Picking your dragon button over lapped the play button so all you can see of play is LAY. Which is fine since you can put together that it is a play button. Picking dragons, the details of the dragons you can pick from are lost on the right side fo the screen into the neon green color. Leaving you guessing as to what it is saying.. I think i saw the word Ox for one of the dragons.. not sure what that would be.. maybe fav food? Really not sure what happened here. Hard to read, buttons over lapping. Step down from last time i played. Real disappointment. Almost feels like they went backwards here.Map prior - poorly put together, could tell it was either rushed, or someone new to map making had put it together. Lots of seems where you could see the parts that were put together. Things would randomly fall through or if they walked into a seam, they'd fall through. Going too far in one direction would unload the map from where you were. Once unloaded, the map wouldn't reload. You were left with ""dead zones"" where you couldn't go back to them. Few trees. Villagers and their homes were bunched together like small villages (this is a plus). Over all, really drove home the feel that the game was a Tech Demo.Map Now - Improved, smooth, no seams, nothing falling through the floor. Map doesn't unload and fail to load again when you come back. Rather odd coloring, kind of a neon green or off green for the ""grass"". More trees. Trees look nicer now. Villagers do not appear to live very close together. Takes away from the feel of villages. Over all, makes the game feel like an Alpha so a step up for sure.Mobs prior - Few villagers, chicks with swords and guys with pitch forks (and of course the villager of doom, but he was a bug/glitch), cyclops, wolves, ents (or where they giants?). AI wasn't that good, simple see and attack. Passive mobs, cows, sheep. Easy to kill.Mobs now - Same types of villagers, plus man at arms (or what i'd call them since they had shields), Didn't play long enough to find many other types of mobs. But i did take note there are now deer, and rabbits. Wolves are still in. AI is still rather basic. Though now they don't all attack on sight (but should in cases like the wolves who sat there and let me fry them for one of the quests)Dragon Prior - Going to be honest here. The dragon we had access to when i first played was awesome looking. Really made me think Dragon. Handled ok, would go lopsided every once in a while. Could even change it's face a little.Dragon now - While it does offer i think premade dragons? Not sure as it wouldn't let me actually pick anything. I was able to change the color of my dragon with sliders. Didn't have that option prior. You could make a pink dragon if you wanted to now. However, the body of the dragon as well as head leave me thinking lizard then dragon. They did it the right way the first time. Though to be fair, i heard we'll be able to have more control over what our dragons look like... hopefully. Otherwise I'd say a step backwards here with the shape.Quests prior - there were zero quests.Quests now - very simple quests at first. I didn't put a lot of time in this time around, but i get the feeling the questions are going to become more and more involved.Combat prior - We had claw/fire to use for weapons. Pretty simple to be honest. shoot some fire, or hit them with your claws. I never found any bugs or problems with it when i played then.Combat now - Able to use fire or a tail whip. Tail whip doesn't always seem to hit. Fire will fly off into the distance and cross the map. I found this out by ranging in the direction i had sent some flames doing the quest to find a chest. Actually seems more buggy then it did prior.Over all prior - I felt the game was a tech demo and nothing more. I wouldn't have recommended the game to anyone, but didn't want to leave a poor review as it's not a finished game. I wanted to wait until the game is finished, then give it a real review that may or may not be positive.Over all now - I don't feel like the game is a tech demo anymore. If i were to gage it's ""age"", i'd say it's early to mid Alpha. It's gettingn a lot of factors together now. The map is for sure cleaned up. Just needs more TLC. Combat and UI needs some heavy work. The game does though seem to flow better. There are some real possibilities for this game if it ever gets finished. Do I recommend the game? My answer is still sadly no. Not because it's an early Alpha after 1.5 yrs. Nor because of the remaining bugs, and unfinshed features. It's not even the snails pace it seems this game is being developed at. The reason why I am not willing to recommend this game is simple. Commuication. The developers made a promise to maintain that with us. They failed to keep their promise. I will not move my recommend to a not. Because the game is not finished. As such, there is still a chance the dev's will turn it around yet again. But we'll see how that goes. I will be uninstalling the game now. I'll load it up again when there appears to be either some heavy updates or the game is finished or in another 1.5 years ;) Which ever comes first.**old review**First, I am not recommending that anyone buy this game.I am putting it as a recommend as there is no middle choice. Right now i'm waiting to see where the game goes.The idea of the game.. oh my god, it's awesome, what it could be is fantastic... but fantasy and reality don't go hand in hand. What will come out of this game is by far not set in stone yet.Currently the game play is little better than a tech demo of a game. Bug filled, not very pretty graphic wise and lacking in content. You can fly around as a dragon, and haphazardly attack things with either fire, or melee. You can fly, and burn stuff. That is what is currently available in the game, plus bugs, lots of bugs, tons of bugs, map disappearing and not reloading, suddenly flying with a tilt, etc.To be perfectly honest here. Only buy this game if you want to support the dev's and take a change on if this game will go anywhere or not. It's been out since Nov 7th of 2014, their last update to the game (not counting the testing updates that you can opt into, was in Jun of 2015. They did have some updates before then. They have been working on the game according to the opt in option. However, being one of the people who didn't opt into it, i wouldn't know what sort of ""testing"" is going on, and based off of the forum posts of actual testers... there doesn't appear to be that much to be impressed with. So, if you like the idea, and want to try to help out the devs... then by all means buy the game. But do so knowing that at this point in the development, you're taking a shot in the dark as to if there will be any sort of pay off (aka finished game) or not.I bought on the first day it was released onto Early Access. While I'm disappointed that i don't have much of a game yet to play, i do have hope and currently do not regert buying the game.I will update this review once the game has something to show for itself other than a tech demo style of game.

Early Access Review
								At this point, I can't recommend this as an early access title. It's probably one of the three crowdfunded titles I actually regret purchasing. In the last two years, very little has changed in the actual product. While there might be ""under the hood"" work being done, there is also very little communication from the developer despite numerous requests for information. The last round of customer complaints on lack of updates elicited a post from the developer where he stated ""I can communicate more regularly and authentically.""This was on July 10th.It's now nearly two months later, and not a single post or bit of information has come from the developers. It could be a deserted project sitting in early access for all I know, but there is no communication present.Even before this, it was spotty - this started on steam EA and had a number of purchasers (I'd guess a few thousand). Then, after that initial open-up for purchase, there were a few updates, almost no communication from the devs, and then silence for several months afterward. Things became active again for a month with a Kickstarter which got another 50K to develop the game, a couple of updates during that time and then complete radio silence for 2-3 months. Until the people that purchased their game practically shook the cages asking what the hell was going on, can we hear anything at all about this project?When tracked down and found in a livestream, the developer stated they were afraid to communicate because of possible ""misunderstandings"". This is a pretty bad excuse. No one misunderstood anything, no one was being negative in their forums, just asking ""can we get an update?"" or ""has this project been abandoned? I haven't seen any sort of communication.""Bottom line, I urge you with all caution NOT to purchase this early-access title. Due to the lack of communication from the developers, the strange excuses, and the lack of overall progress over the period of two years, this is most likely not going to be finished, and any money or hopes put on this are likely to be a wasted effort. I do expect another round of crowd-funding before they finally go totally dark and abandon it, but the pattern has been pretty clear since this project started.If the behavior actually changes, then I'll be happy to update the review. At this point, though, buyer beware. They don't have enough personnel or resources in order to make the project they are selling.			"

								I bought this game with super high expectations, it had a lot of potential (just think, being the DRAGON) so cool. I got involved on the player boards. reported bugs, made suggestions, was incredibly excited for the future of this game.  but then I noticed that after 6 months of playing the game, it was still a game with no direction set in a glitchy world with tiny paramaters, where you could fly off the edge of the map where it wouldn't render in under 15 seconds, and it STAYED THAT WAY. now I'm all about supporting a game that I see has drive and potential, but this one seems to have turned out all potential, no drive. with months of the same glitches and bugs, and no new content ever added, I see now that it's not going to turn in to anything beyond an empty shell of a game idea. wish the devs put more development into their game before putting it up on steam like it had any semblance of a game.

								There seems to be quite a few negatives for this game.First of all, I would like to point out that this very early early access. It has potential; and this is why I supported it. I play on and off when new updates are released. This is a very unique game which I hope does become a reality like the developer envisoned to begin with.Just imagine flying around like a dragon, being the fiercest dragon around. How great is that?There are bugs and problems which you expect at every early access. But would I give it a negative. No. There isn't much to do at this stage but I hope people buy it because they see the potential in the game and want the developer to foinish it so we can all act out being a dragon.If I have to i'll pay the developer to keep going. :) that's how much I like the concept.

								It Saddens me to have to write a review like this, but let it be said that firstly this is all my own opinion based on MY experiences with the game over the last 4 months since I bought it and played it.With that said, this game is disapointing beyond measure. The poor attention to detail, the absolute laziness and lack of effort put into something as simple as a camera control, and I won't even start on how the graphics have gotten WORSE over time! This game has absoutely amazing potential, it is a game that would go absolutely over the moon! However, there needs to be some sort of change in the current direction of the game. There is little to no effort of improvement on the actual core of the game and what you see in the trailers and advertisement is not what you get when you actually get into the game.There are of course many great things about this game.. The play style, the fact that the protagonist is and will be a dragon instead of a human, and the fact that you can choose to be good or evil. However, all other good things about the game that are possible right now are just ideas at the very core thrown into the game without a second thought.I urge you not to buy the game just yet, as I believe it was thrown into crowd funding without any plan as to what to do with the money towards the game thereafter. The result so far is poor and quite appauling, I sincerely hope that this will change in the future as I was not nearly as excited about any other game as I was about this before I bought it.Overall: 3/10Don't buy it just yet, wait it out a bit. That is my opinion.			"

								I do recommend this game, even at this stage, to people willing to put up with bugs and etc.I played it for a couple of minutes and I love the concept. I would really like to post this review to notify fellow players and mostly the developers about the things I have found. Please don't burn me down, I am not a very good gamer, but I believe I should be able to at least have a shot at any game, so here are some things that would make the game idiot-proof:1. Dragon flight speed has been greatly improved since last time I played it. Steering my dragon around now goes easily. However, I am still missing a possibility to kind of hang still in the air and possibly land like a helicopter. I am curious if there are going to be air battles and how those are going to be implemented because we are going to need a better way to brake, make sharp turns, perform acrobatics and etc. Sometimes you will simply need a sharp turn to eat that one goblin's head off!2. Camera: Is fine now, good job!3. Dragon creation screen: Yay for customisation! I realise that once the mechanics of the game are running smoothly, you can start focussing on this point. Being able to zoom in on the face and edit features would be great (look at the Elder Scrolls series, Fallout, etc). Turn your dragon around like you are sculpting it would be awesome. And genders, we need genders.4. I believe that there should eventually be a ""lock on"" option during battles and the HP bars of your target should be visible. The battles right now are just really easy: you land somewhere, goblins come running and you burn them, then eat them. Or turn them into a bloodstain and then eat them. 5. SFX and music: The music is really epic, but in my opinion it would be great if the music would change depending on the situation, calm during flight and just walking around, and epic during battles and engages. The SFX are fine for a game in this stage, however you may want to make the dragon a little more menacing by e.g. adding a kind of snarling sound when he breathes fire, adding sounds of pain and agony when you are hit (same goes for the enemies).6. FPS: I have a very decent PC that can run pretty heavy games, but somehow when I play the game in high graphics, my FPS drop to levels I'd expect on my 5-year-old laptop. Low graphics work fine.7. Graphics: yeah I know these are not important yet when you are building on the mechanics, but of course the graphics need an overhaul. Ground textures are simple, characters look square. Movement of the dragon is lacking especially when running. There is no AI implemented into the enemies (yet) so they come running and start hitting you like they are suicidal. Yada yada, stuff for later. Keep up the great work, I am really looking forward to more!			"

								I'd like a bit of survival, maybe? Add hunger, thirst, territory and the fight to keep it as you guard your eggs and your mate. This would make it a bit less of an RPG, but you can also add a RolePlay mode to it. This would give players a choice to RolePlay, or survive in the process of RolePlay, or  only survive.			"

								(UPDATE) https://www.reddit.com/r/FromEggToWyrm/comments/5y2pan/demo_of_ground_combat_and_stuff/A user named Flappy literally made a LITE version of this game from scratch just to show how easy it is to build the same game. Honestly I'm don't know a thing about game development, but this is quite surprising that a single individual has achieved something similar with no funding.Come back in 2 years and you might see this in Alpha, and no longer in a Pre-Alpha state.Dragon: The Game has been in development for 2 years, with a team of people working on it, and all that is offered is something that cannot even be called a demo. I refunded this game almost a year ago after quickly realizing the path it was taking, and following it to this very day, I can see I made the RIGHT choice on refunding it.A year ago the public build for this game were abysmal. No sounds, crashing everywhere, no multiplayer, NPCs falling from the sky, caves filled with holes, very unresponsive and basic melee attack, etc. Now from what I've seen, (and from the most recent update) sounds have been added, there is much more diversity in the NPCs, crashing seems to still occur for some people, etc. While the game HAS improved somewhat, you have to realize that over the duration of a year, this team has added things I've seen other devs that weren't even properly funded do within 4-6 months. This game has been funded successfully for 35k on Kickstarter.I look toward the devs of Yogadventures and then I look back at this game, and I see a similar fate. Yogadventures is infamously known for being funded, but handled by inexperienced developers who simply gave up in the end, and plopped the filth they had been working on for about a year or two on their kickstarter supporters. And EVEN then they seemed to have made more progress then this game has. I'm not saying this dev team would do such a thing, but for HOW LONG they've been working on this successfully funded project; and what they have to offer within the duration of 2 years, I simply don't think people should purchase this game. Atleast, not until we ACTUALLY see some real progress here.Don't get me wrong here, I WANT this game to be what it promises. We ALL WANT a Dragon Sim. I really hope the devs will be able to somehow pull this off. If you are a DIEHARD fan of dragons, and have always wanted a game like this, get it. If your like me and are a bit skeptical on the duration of this game's development and progress, wait either for a price drop or, again, when we see some real progress. Best of luck guys! :)			"

								Two Year Update:The game has made minimal progress, if not gone backwards. BUYER BEWARE THIS IS NOT A GAME AND IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL IT EVER WILL BE. What is there is terrible, glitchy, non performant, poor play control, and most of all, ""not fun"". They've been ""selling"" this for over two years and the game still doesn't even have an objective or a semblence of a gameplay element beyond some very unnatural flying. Lots of big talk and big claims, but make no mistake:This game is snake oil and represents everything BAD about ""early access"". You've been warned.Original review from two years ago below:---------------------------I bought this game as an investment into what it could possibly become one day, but please let me explain something, buy beware:The content of the current build does NOT include content from these screenshots, while the developers are honest about this being a very early build, this is NOT even alpha status.Typically, alpha status is when the majority of the engine is done, but content is still under works. In this case, almost nothing is done. The demo its self is buggy and unpolished. It looks like something could build in unity in a few hours if you replaced the graphics with squares and rectangles.Sorry devs, but I'm giving this one a big juicy thumbs down. I love the concept, but in all honesty can not promote the buying of this game in its current state.			"

								This game has a lot of work to be done, but besides that, its a wonderful game and the graphics are really well done, even if it is in Alpha stage.Note that this game will not be completely ""bug-free"" for say, and it wont be ""waxed and polished"" when you get it, i have only played 20-something minutes of it and every time i die i will start to lag really bad, but it is what i expect from a Alpha stage game. Yea, i HAVE noticed their are other games out there such as Istralia, and I of the dragon, but i personally think the quest-line in I of the dragon gets boring after a while. And in Istralia, you have to pay to play as a dragon, and (even for me) it takes WEEKS to even become an adult in that game >.<Listen, people who are making this, TAKE YOUR TIME! People (including me) have been trying to find a game like this FOR YEARS, this is an actual game where you can take on the role of a dragon, and i know you WILL meet the people's standards, just keep chugging along~			"

								Writing this review because I requested a refund on a game I played 27 minutes and it was denied. Seeing as I can't get my money back... I spent $15 on this game in 2014 hoping it would become something. Still waiting. The devs don't seem to respond to the community and the videos and images suggest the game is something it's not... or playable in general. Don't buy this game, it's been in a rut for two years and all it looks like is it's managed by devs who are learning how to do basic things as they go. This isn't the same game I was originally supporting. I noticed Achievements shown under the game. Really? The game can't function with a basic purpose, or be even REMOTELY worth $18, but there's achievements?I've been well duped. Congrats. Thanks for taking my time and money.			"

								You are a dragon.  You can barely fly.  If you walk over the ground after breathing fire on it, you take damage.  Your first quest is to kill rabbits.  Believe it or not, the controls are so bad that this is actually a bit of a challenge.I know this game is early access, but even assuming it is ever finished, I can't imagine it being improved enough to become enjoyable.  It is so far from any sort of acceptable benchmark, even for an indie game.  Literally everything about it, from the start up screen on out, says this game is not ready for any kind of public consumption.  Certainly not at the laughable price.  I couldn't even reccomend this game if it was on sale for a dollar.  I got it as a gift from a friend, and I still felt ripped off.			"

The games been out for over a year, and content has dragged out slower than a sheep with no legs and today they decide HEY GUYS LETS DO A KICKSTARTER FOR MORE CASH! :DThe point of a Kickstarter is to help you get a game from planning, and into the development phase. It isn't ""Oh, I fancy a few extra bucks, so lets sell custom skins and scales ingame as reward tiers"". Horrible, horrible, horrible.

								I bought this game around two years ago. It sounded exactly like the kind of game I'd be interested in, being able to be a dragon and forge your own path. I played a flash game with the same idea.The only issue is, that flash game was in a more playable state than this game. I don't know anything about the kickstarter or what, all I know is that I got this game and it has yet to even be PLAYABLE. I didn't pay $15 to get a barely functioning demo with nothing to do. None of the features listed are even implemented yet. Even if a game is early access, at least have it be in a playable state before pawning it off on people. For $18 to boot.			"

								I... I don't even know where to begin. This looks nothing like the videos and screenshots advertised. It looks awful. Even on 'Beautiful' settings, Dragon: The Game looks and feels atrocious. The menus are slow, laggy and ugly. The game takes forever to load and appears to be not responding for ages. The dragon itself looks like the child of an ankylosaur and a pterosaur after a heavy night of drinking and rough sex. Enemies pop back into existence seconds after they've died and go all rubbery when they die. You bounce off things. The HUD doesn't work and I can't upgrade my dragon. Windowed Mode doesn't work either. There's no eating animation, things just disappear. The R key does nothing. Aiming is impossible half the time. And I keep on running into a bug where I can't fly forwards. Random areas are cut off. The terrain is bright and ugly and overfilled with fog. And so on and so forth.Normally I wouldn't be so angry, but I got this game as a gift and requested that the original purchaser get their money back because I felt they'd been ripped off. Dragon: The Game has been in Early Access for a stupidly long time, with an amazingly good concept, but they barely have an Alpha yet, let alone a Beta.Avoid this game at all costs. You want a dragon game? Dragonflight has far better performance and controls, Time of Dragons is free to play and TESV: Skyrim has mods that let you become/ride dragons. Heck, the Pyro in Team Fortress 2 is a better fire-spitting monster than whatever this is.			"

								Dragon wants to be a open world RPG where you play a actual Dragon and can evolve over time.The concept details moral choices for your character ( yes.. the dragon) and loads of customization.There are good signs of things to come but today (09/11/2014) there is no reason i can think of that anybody should pay the obscene asking price of 18 euro. You can not charge such a price for a product in this state, even IF it will evolve over time.Being a very ... VERY early access the game is filled with bugs and glitches, expect everything.What can you do today (09/11/2014) in the game ?-Fly as a dragon (when it dose not buggout)-Use flame breath to burn down buildingsI honestly hope that this tittle will become something great, but that day is not today (09/11/2014)I will check back on this tittle when updates are available and maybe do a follow-up video if i think it's warranted.In the mean time you can check my initial impressions video

Gameplay barely amounts to pre-alpha, and the graphics are, frankly, incredibly poor for a PC title.Unfortunately one of the poor examples of Steam's Early Access system.Unless something drastically changes, and soon, I can't recommend this game.

Early Access Review
Patch 8.3 Review UpdateI reinstalled the game to check out the latest beta patch. I wrote my previous review months ago, but now I figure it's time to come back and readdress some things with a bit more clarity.I purchased this early access game in April 2015. It is now currently January 2016. There have been very little changes since I bought it. Certainly not enough to ""wow"" me yet.The Positives1) Previously, I made mention that the flight controls were sickeningly sensitive to the point of being out-of-control insane. With the 8.3 update, it's not as bad. I was able to move without throwing up in the process. That is one thing I can say has noticeably improved. It was so terrible before that I couldn't play the game at all.2) The terrain seems more lush than before. All I remember was long stretches of blank ground with barely any trees or mountains or much of anything.3) You can grab people and animals and carry them into the air and eat them. If you can manage to get it to work properly, that is. I'll get to that later.4) You can now color the dragon. This wasn't an option before.5) Flying around in circles is fun, even if I'm not really doing anything important. So, ponts for being immersive.The Negatives1) They said the optimization was improved, but it still seemed pretty poor on various settings. The funny thing is, the lag and stuttering happens the most when running on the ground, and it's smooth sailing (no pun intended) when you're flying over miles of forests. This happened to me before the patch, as well, on the fastest graphics setting on a brand new gaming machine with a more-than-capable graphics card. This needs some serious tweaking before it's playable for a wider range of people.2) While the flight controls were easier to deal with, the other controls were a bit of a mess. I tried like hell to pick up people off the ground in mid-flight. I managed to successfully do it once, then proceeded to drop said human because I'm spamming the Q button like crazy trying to snatch him up. It barely works. I was more excited than I needed to be when I finally managed to get it.For some reason, the flight controls were automatically selected as inverted when I reinstalled and restarted the game. I'm used to normal flight controls. This isn't a big complaint, because that's an option you can change.Grabbing things will sometimes just bug out the dragon or the enemy you're picking up to where they're almost melting together like in The Thing.3) The envrionment is hilariously glitchy, as are the enemies and objects. While flying the dragon around, I couldn't count how many rocks, trees, tree stumps, houses and people were either stuck halfway through the ground and peeking up through a mound of snow like they got trapped in a snowbank, or were floating in mid-air like they were caught in a time-warp. I almost don't want to call this a ""negative"" because I laughed whenever I saw it. I actually got stuck underneath a floating rock at some point.Sometimes you'll get stuck on a piece of the terrain-- say, a house or a tree-- and you'll suddenly and mysteriously get launched backward several yards as if you had been rocketed off of a pine tree trebuchet. This also made me laugh. ""Where are you going, Dranonimous?!"" I yelled.The LOD is a mind trip. In the distance, the envrionment is just one giant oil paint color blotch, which really negates the look of the piece of the map you're currently standing in. It makes you think that if you go anywhere near the color blotch, you'll disappear into the gaming void. I didn't want to go past the borders of the snowy forest, which I figured was the least glitchy part of the map. I did fly somewhat away form it to check out a badly-rendered lake. Then I turned back because the rest of the map had also turned into a lake somehow. 4) I never lost any health. Or gained any. I don't think you can really get hurt yet. I understand that eating is meant to replenish you, but that doesn't seem to have a purpose. Not yet, anyway. And your enemies are clones of one pitchfork-wielding dude and cows. Or cottages.5) Maybe I'm not the first to say this. If I am the first to say it, then let it be known: The dragon... is ugly. I'm sorry. But it just is.The dragon's front arms look like they should be socketed on a G.I. Joe. The back legs belong to some kind of alien frog. The head... well, I can barely look at it, because whenever I try to, the dragon shoves his face in the ground like an ostrich. The tail is three times as long as its body.The running and flying animations aren't very fluid. Instead of running on its bulging soldier arms and amphibious hind legs, it does this sort of ""hop"" that really reinforces the whole ""Frog"" concept. Maybe there'd be a different animation for walking, which would follow the stride of most other four-legged creatures. Right now, it just looks awkward and weird and not at all aesthetically pleasing.The flight animations aren't much better. The body is sort of stiff as its airborne, sans the waving, flapping tail, and the wings resemble cardboard.Final ThoughtsOverall, my opinion is mixed. It's starting to show a tiny bit of potential, but the updates have not been very grand since I bought this, and they state it should be ready for release and out of Early Access in two years (and they said this when I bought it). Yeeeah, I don't think so.Dragon The Game is in VERY EARLY ALPHA, and this should be considered when making the Early Access purchase. It is barely even half ready after nine months. With how slow the game is updated, and the lack of massive improvements, I'd say it would take more than two years to make this game bug-free and good enough to buy.Does that mean you shouldn't support it? Eh. If you think it'll go anywhere, be my guest. I still feel like my money hasn't gone to anything worthwhile.			"

								for the love of god DO NOT BUY THIS ""GAME"" ive had it for over 2 years and its only gotten worse, i tried to stick it out in hopes of it getting better but at this point i doubt that will ever happen.at this rate that demo video is at least a few years out. i had really high hopes for this game when i first got it but it turns out its just a bunch of bought assets clumsily thrown together with horrable scaling, broken game play, and serious preformance issues, its almost like watching a stop motion video except its all stop and a few stutters in between.

								Well I have to say that this game is extremely early access. If you want a better play experiance get the EA beta one. although the stable version is easier to control the dragon in ways.It takes a little while to get used to.I haven't found a lair yet or any other dragons. Houses are fun to burn down.The graphics need more work but the soundtrack thats implemented is just amazing, really good job done on it. The game desricption tells you all that you need to know about the game. There is basic flight and combat abilities. I can't seem to press c to see my character. The deer spawn rates are insane lol. However, despite all the bugs and issues and various improvments needed I will continue to help support this game. Why? because I can see a lot potential in this and I would love for there to be an excellant dragon game on steam. As long as the dev keeps updating and improving the game then this review will stay positive.Honestly this game is under development. buy it, support it and maybe it'll become great.			"

Early Access Review
								I will update this review with each successive update to the game.If you find this review unhelpful, tell me why and I will try to fix it.Revised 7-8-2016Overview: It is evident from the blog and other resources that the focus right now is on game function and code stability, mostly under the hood stuff, the kind of stuff that matters much more than how pretty it looks. Nobody gives a damn about your Corvette if there is no working engine, and nobody cares about a game with underdeveloped code. In that regard I think Red Level has its priorities straight, and in the play-through my priority at this phase in development was to look at code stability, controls, and interface. Stability and Control score a solid OK, it took me only about five minutes to figure out the basics of movement and flight and after ten was able to fly around without crashing into anything. Movement & Controll: For those thinking of buying now, the dragon maneuvers like you are flying a helicopter, gravity is irrelevant once you hit the space-bar and continues to be irrelevant after you let go, which causes you to slowly float back down to the surface. A The W key allows forward flight, with a momentum dynamic like you would logically expect. Turning is instant and mouse directed, but you will tend to drift like a Ford on ice while cornering even if your dragon faces the desired direction instantly so plan ahead. Be aware that the game does not bind the mouse to the game screen, so long turns in one direction will cause the mouse to drift off screen and will close the window when you click any mouse button.Combat: Combat is very one sided, both in terms of damage taken, and physical damage dealt since you can only swing your tail to one side or your dragon, so make sure the thing you want to kill is on that side. Fire breath is hard to aim at first so be careful using it on the ground or you will burn yourself before anything around you. Think like an airplane when using this, you want to strafe a target with fire if you can, before landing to collect it.Navigation: As of right now navigation is line of sight only, you get a look at a map sketch when you first drop in to the game but you have no mini-map in your interface so plan on getting lost. Right now having your bearings doesn't really matter since there is not all that much to do. .Quests/Tasks: The quest system did not load during my most recent playthrough and is likely being rewritten.Interface: Currently you get three small circles in the lower right had corner of the screen which tell you what powers or attacks you have. There are ""Roar"" ""Tail Swipe"" ""Bite Attack"" and ""Fire Breath"". Roar did not provide audio feedback when used, and I could not observe any notable effect to things on the surface. Tail Swipe/Fire Breath controls are functional though there are some quarks to be resolved as the game progresses. A Three button mouse is needed to use both bite and tailswing. There is a hunger readout on the bottom right which gives access to the upgrade menu which is currently in development and not working. A new menu tree is in process which looks promising.Graphics: Vast improvements to terrain and graphics quality were included in the most recent update. The framework is there for high poly models but they have not been applied yet.Sound: Mostly placeholder sounds, they have good ambient noises but the looping soundtrack can be a bit annoying. Improvements to come, but likely not until after Alpha.Secondary Effects: In shooters this would be like bullet holes where you shoot walls, or dynamic destructible vehicles. In dragon this is most notable with fire breath, where your fire can spread from one part of a building to the whole. You can burn down trees, or knock them over with your tail.Physics: Physics modeling for a dragon in flight is helicopter based, you will drift in the direction you are leaning when not using the throttle. Glide dynamics have been added, but gravity is weak for your dragon and allows for unrealastic floating, and are now fall/impact deaths for you or NPC's, but collision mapping is buggy and can cause models to drop through. The glide dynamic has improved somewhat with the most recent update, and is being dialed in progressively.AI: Villagers become hostile when you get close enough, and are harder to kill. They will always take the shortest route to you, and will stack up beneath you if you fly just right. Animals are neutral, (except for bears) but will run away if you get too close. The recent update has reduced the amound of ambient wildlife, making eating more difficult.Stability: Beta, not optimized. You will have low frame rates regardless of your system power. I maxed out at 32FPS but dropped as low as 12 at near max graphics, which did not strain my system. Pre 3-29 update I was lucky to get 12FPS max, so there is improvement. There have been a series of small un-announced updates which have improved overall stability.Glitches: A quick twenty minutes of game play did not result in any crashes or game breaking glitches. I did not get stuck in a cave, or get caught under the map. When grabbing objects you are almost guaranteed to experience a glitch known as the ""runaway rag-doll"". This glitch can happen as a result of poor collision mapping, or can occur if the engine thinks the object its grabbing is weightless and therefore has no inertia. You get an explosion of flailing limbs that can be distracting, but that’s about it.Another prominent glitch occurs when two animated objects collide on uneven or akward terrain, resulting in one or both objects being thrown violently out of map or straight into the air. This glitch occurs in nearly every game in development, and was made popular by Skyrim's ""hammer spike"" in which being killed by an overhead swing from a giant launched your character straight up into the air. You will see this in Dragon if you land directly on a live deer or wolf. Sometimes the both of you are thrown, or sometimes only one of you. This is more likely to happen on hillsides or in rocky terrain. It also happens if you tail swing a sheep, deer, or wolf into another object without killing them, resulting in a violent but non lethal vertical launch.Developer: Red Level Games as an upstart has an opportunity to fill the general void left by developers like Bungie, EA, and even Microsoft. All of these companies have had rather lackluster recent releases that have underperformed in some way, they have become victims of their own success and now sell titles based on their franchise hype.Red Level Games has all the attributes of a good developer, they:1. Operate an independent website that isn't an eyesore, and was reasonably easy to navigate.2. Have an easy ""contact us"" section which allows anyone to email them directly.3. Post blog updates to their website and Steam (recently on a monthly basis)4. Allow the community to contribute to game mechanics where applicable.5. Are honest and forward in their efforts.6. Clearly communicate update goals and priorities.Dragon: The Game has great potential, especially if it allows the community to generate content and assist in building the product. They have already partly done so by releasing a model dragon skeleton for hobbyist animators to play with, and to potentially contribute to animation in game. They appear dedicated, and work in a fantasy niche that nobody has attempted to fill until now. For that reason, and the ones listed above, I can recommend this title to anyone who wants to support beta development. This means that you are willing to play a partally functional game and be a good sport about it untill things get fixed.			"

Early Access Review
								I really, really, realllllllllllllyyyy wish there was neutral button. Becuase i'm rather dead locked on this. But since i'm a rather trusting guy (and I dont want the Devs chance of making this great ruined), I alas, must recomend this. BUT ONLY, with a very wary recomdation based on the game that was promised, not as it is. Simply put. the potential for this game is through the roof. And if they ever reach what they showed in the trailer, and screens, i'll be more then happy with the twenty bucks I spent on this. Just the concept is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. An open world, sanbox Dragon simulator game? Sign me the hell up! The game (despite being extremley primitive) right now is...oddly charming. Like when your wrecking villages (which are two hourse, three dudes, and a cow), makes me have a dumb, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ smile. Alas, I must get into the ""very wary"" recomend part. Simply put, the game in its state right now, is...shall we say, lacking?  As a kind word. I know this is early access. But games like the Forest, Subnauctia, The Long Dark, and Ark are early access, and they look, and feel way smoother and more polished. I dont mind jank...but this is going a little too far for my tastes. Also, the screens in the front, are borderline false advertising, so I wish the devs would remove them for somthing thats more accurate tothe build were in.  Hopefully, since the devs have just got there kickstarter money recently, they'll  improve upon the game much more in the upcoming months (hopefully...).So right now, i'll give the game a pass, simply because of it's potential, the fact it's in early access, and I want the devs to succed. Though like I said before, if you DO not want to support the devs this early, and get a...rather basic product (with alot more promised in the future) I would say lay off. Use the twenty bucks to grab Skyrim if you really want a good Dragon themed game. Or Dragons Dogma.			"

The idea's amazing and there are a lot of directions that this game can go, but when they say this game is Early Access, they mean this game is VERY Early Access. I will absolutely be updating this review as more stuff gets released.You create yourself a dragon, you can fly around and you can incinerate stuff - and by that I mean trees - and that's pretty much it. My extremely low hour count isn't because I got bored, it's just because there isn't a whole ton of stuff to do in here . . . yet. The good news is, as of right now they seem to be updating about once a month, ish, and hopefully that'll continue to happen for a good long while.I have high hopes for this game, but I'm honestly not sure if I should really recommend it yet, I'll give it a thumbs up for now but I kind of wish there was a ""neutral"" option. Definitely wait until you can get it on sale.edit: okay, there have been a couple game updates since I wrote this that I haven't played. I will get around to it eventually! "

Early Access Review
								I am happy to say that they at least made progress. They started a Kickstarter for the game a while back and got quite a bit of funding for the game now which I hope they put to good use and fully flesh out the game.The developers are rather nice and I see them speak to the community and are now regularly updating.Graphics are that of the ps2 Era and at this point with the issues of optimization a simplistic look and/or voxel art style might have done the game wellMechanics such as leveling are finally working although all of them are not implemented.The first task of claiming a hunting ground is perplexing. I am unsure how one accomplishes this and so intend I flew around burning homes and creatures.The combat is lackluster. As a dragon I feel powerful, but perhaps too powerful. I can just glide above enemy range and breath fire on them. Also, why do we as a dragon take damage from our own flames? If anything our internals can withstand the heat so why wouldn't our scaly hides do the same if not better? That should be changed in my opinion.For now I believe the developers are finally bringing the features they wanted and I hope to see further development. I recommend following this game but not necessarily buying it. For now I cannot recommend this game.			"

								What can I say about this that hasn't been said already?This game is very clearly in the early, early stages of development, with possible YEARS to go before it sees the quality experience it promises.  The controls are wonky, the music ugly and obtrusive, the animations like something out of a beginner's tutorial, the environments ugly for lack of a better word, and the fonts the sort you'd use as placeholders for a real thing.So far more than a little disappointed with what was presented, but I have hopes that it will improve greatly in the future.  Then--and only then--will I be able to recommend this in good conscience.			"

								This game is very early access. It is difficult to navigate the menus, there is no tutorial, I have no idea how to start editing my dragon, and the controls I did figure out are really strange to me. I can't make a full heads or tails of this right now but I recommend that you wait to buy this until the game is patched up a bit. I understand this is an early access game, but the amount of problems I ran in to for the first five minutes was crazy. I didn't really want to put a like or dislike, but I cannot in my honest opinion recommend this game at this point. It is not worth the money. Maybe my mind will change later.			"

It does have the goal in mind, but at the moment - it is far from ready.It may be something to look forward to, eventually - but for now, keep it off to the side if you want to watch it.Give it, and the developers time to round it up to at least a Beta design first.

								This game has potential, but unless you're willing to wait another maybe 5-10 years before development has really progressed, save your money. I bought this game nearly two years ago knowing the functionality was bad (by bad I mean it was nearly unplayable), but I was fine with it then because I absolutely loved the concept and was really excited to see what was in store. I purchased it in February of 2015.Let me start by saying the game has had some improvements since I first bought it. When I first bought it I could barely fly, the map was insanely small and I kept flying off the map and not being able to get back, the customization for dragons was also really bad, the alignment of buttons and interface elements in the game was all over the place. When I tried multiplayer back then it didn't work.Two years later, the map generates and the dragon customization is a little bit better (but there are still many issues). Flying is still a major issue in this game. When you fly for awhile, god forbid you hit something and you'll be bounced in every direction like a ping pong ball. The alignment of the interface has gotten better in some parts, but even with that I've noticed just from the main menu with the proper resolution buttons are still cut off and not lined up properly. Some buttons still don't work, which after two years of development says a lot towards where this game is heading. Multiplayer now is just a chat room. I tried it just a few minutes ago and you don't actually play with other users it just creates a chat room where you can chat. It's also really glitchy and I ended up getting stuck in the chat room and having to forcefully quit. This game really shouldn't be called multiplayer because it's not.I feel like for the amount of time I've had this game, not much has really been done with it. A lot of major bugs haven't been fixed. The dev team are releasing patches every couple months but it's a very VERY slow progression. If you want to support a game in development but have no intention of playing it for at least 5-10 years.. I'll go as far to say 20-30 years with the rate it's currently going, by all means get it. But you're going to be waiting a lonnnnggggg time before it becomes fully functional and a real game worth playing. Save your money; don't buy this game.			"

Early Access Review
								In the game's present state, I couldn't recommend that people pay any money until more content is added.  There's no tutorial, creating a dragon and navigating the menus to play is a chore (you have to name your dragon AND select it after creating it in order to start the game), deleting a dragon causes a game breaking bug that forces you to delete all the files in your steamapps/dragon the game folder and reinstall the game, there's no in-game options menu or sound, nor are there things to interact with.  I did burn down a few houses, but that was all there was to do.  For those that want to support the devs and trust they'll produce something from the nothing it currently is, I'd say go for it.  For those who like to justify their purchases and have to worry about a budget, I'd say wait a while until more content is added.  As of now, I'd consider this more of a gutted tech demo than an actual game.Seeing as this game is under development, I reserve the right to change this recommendation in the future.

The mechanics are broken, the menus are broken, and even the controls, one of the very first things you perfect as a developer are broken. The game is nowhere near ready for release, much less ready for sale. Stay away until the developers make it into a real game instead of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ flying simulator			"

								I will start off by saying the alpha as of now is pretty rough. It doesn't look like it used to. The thing is, the devs recently rebuilt this game on a new system from the ground up. So it is completley different in terms of looks and gameplay now at the time of writing this review.But I will say that even though the graphics aren't great and the gameplay has quite a few bugs, this game will go far. I already have a good amount of fun flying around eating animals and villagers, picking up pigs and dropping them to the ground, and burning down anything remotley flammable. Tail-whacking wolves off their feet is pretty fun too. It's a fun game to play if you want to run around as a dragon for a bit.I'm giving this a thumbs up because I believe in this game and where it will go. For the usual gamer, I'd recommend purchasing this alpha only if you'd like to support the development of it and stand with the game as it grows over time. It's going to grow into something truly spectacular, I promise you.			"

								'fore you ask, yes, I've only got half an hour in this game.What I can tell you: I like what I see being developped. games where Eating is an experiance mechanic for Dragons is always interesting. the flying controls are interesting and require practice to do well.Most of the issues I have can be attributed to the fact that it's Early access. I'd like to see better camera controls when on the ground, and some tweaking on the camera in the air. I did end up falling out of the world where it hadn't loaded, but that was mostly because Baby dragons are weak fliers.In any case, if you wish to support this game, go ahead and buy it. it has potential and I'd like to see where they go from here.

								-NO FINAL JUDGEMENT (22/11/14)-This review is based on the current early access. And i really recommend NOT to buy it *YET* if you hope to spend at least some minutes having fun.There is nothing to have fun with at the moment.The good: A FOV-Slider, yay! Being a draong flying around and doing...dragon-stuff!The bad: Performance is beyond awful. On my rig i get between 5 and 30 fps on ""Fantastic"" which isn't fantastic at all and on ""Fastest"" too. Controls and movement feel clunky World is quite empty and dead Not much content at allPre-release-judgement:Got potential, if remembering what ""Drakan"" or ""I of the dragon"" made of the Dragon-theme. But the road to whatever it wants to be seems a rather long one. Of course it's early access and this is what you should expect.So only pay for it if you like to support the devs. Besides that there's not much to do yet. The screenshots provided already show you everything. It was hard for me to get to the 5 minutes to be allowed to post this review.If this changes, i will update this review of course.			"

Early Access Review
Note: Please realize I am not recommending this game based on its current state. If you're thinking about buying this because you want a complete title that is playable right now, I suggest you look elsewhere - though the whole reason I recommend purchasing Dragon: The Game in its current state is so it is pushed towards completion.That being said, let's be truthful: In its current state, Dragon: The Game is unplayable. It is literally unplayable. There is nothing to do but fly around, and even that is tough given the clunky controls and the nonsensical camera. And then there are the bugs. Oh god, if you want the grandest example of how laughable Dragon is in its current state, I suggest you try crashing your dragon into the ground a few times and trying to fly afterwards. Seriously. You'll be flying up when your dragon is upside down, and you'll be flying forward when your dragon is trying his damnest to crash into the ground again. Once again, Dragon is not really playable in its current state. It's super early alpha, maybe not even that.However, guys, we have to support this cause. This is a game where you can become what you've always wanted to become. What? No, not a gynecologist. A DRAGON! If this developer keeps his promises and delivers a full and complete Dragon: The Game, we will be able to do just that. That is why I recommend a purchase of Dragon: The Game. If you have money to spare, but nothing else to spend it on... help Dragon: The Game get some wind under its wings. Please?			"

								I really wish steam had a netural button. On one hand I want to recomend this game but on the other hand there are reasons why I couldn't.I'll start with whyI would recomend this game first. Who doesn't dream about an open world RPG where you get to explore, destroy or befriend villages, hunt, build up a lair, raid for loot, take part in ever shifting politics and most importantly you play as a dragon. Now this game really has the potential to be that game someday and that is what the developers have been dreaming of. Since I got this game, I have seen it change quite a bit, but don't take this as it being anywhere near complete.Now on to bad parts. Currrently the game is very far from complete, as I said, the game does have potenntial but it still has a long, long way to go. The flying mechanics are I have to say a lot better than when I first joined (the flight and flight controls are a lot more stable, thank goodness)  and the textures whilst nowhere near good are at least less of an eyesore than the previous ones (think of Rome II's release and the shining dirt that appeared on that, that was what the previous textures were like.) but the presensce of numerous terrain bugs (floating objects E.C.T.) as well as the lack of things to do in the game in it's current state show that it is a long way from being finished.Overall I would have to say that I would recomend this game (not really in its' current state) simply because of the potential that is here and it is the potential of the game that just holds it up at the moment. If you're unsure of buying it then perhaps wait fo while for the game to become better but the trickey thing is that the potential can only  be realised through people buying into this early acess which is both the blessing and the curse of early acess. Now unlike many games that are in 'early acess' I can see that this game isn't just a anouther blatent cashgrab and that the devs really want this game to succeed and I do really see that it is possible for them to be able to pull it off which is anouther reason why I'm recomending it.Just one more thing I have to say before I end this review, a lot of people are complaining about how the game doesn't look like the videos and screenshots on the store page and how it is in such  a low stage of development compared to the time it's been out, that is because those screenshots and videos are from the previous itteration of this game which fthe devs as far as I know scrapped because they encountered a serious problem with the code, as such this is essentially a whole new game that the devs created  which is why it is in the stage of development it's in.Now taking onto consideration what I said, go ahead and make up your own mind about whether or not you want to support this game.

								I was given a key for this game long time ago, and I just tried the game.  There is much that is lacking.  You can fly around, and attack villagers with a breath weapon, but that is pretty much it.  There isn't any sound yet.  That said, it seems to be honest on the home page and it looks like the developers communicate in the message board.  Really early in development, like alpha, but I think it isnt a bad thing to support.			"

Early Access Review
								I do recomend this game to people who like helping out with beta games or early access games.   The games base is awesome and the graphics are pretty good in my opinion. I have a few suggestions.-The age of your dragon should affect its size. for example: a baby dragon should have a smal body, baby like eyes, and small wings that don't allow them to fly that easily or that far.-The dragons should grow over time so that if you make a baby dragon, you won't be stuck a baby forever. (and don't make the ancient dragons die unless the user deletes them.)-You should start out with only 6 skill points instead of 8 so that you don't go overboard with your skills.-To go along with your villlages and castles, you should add towns and cities. (Kind of like skyrim, I know that.)-The giants should not stay in one place, but move to other places in groups.-The dragons should be able to use their right click move to be able to build caves, or dens, to live in. The caves/dens should be as big as your dragon can dig (or as large as the user feels ok) and at the end of their building, they should be able to choose what type of den it is. for example: you could have a den with water surrounding the nest if you feel you want to be a ""water dragon""-You should add different types of dragons: Water dragons, lava dragons, ect.-You should be able to drink water to restore your mana or health.-You should allow dragons to mate with each other and share dens. (i don't think there should be eggs though.)-Instead of there only being mountains, there should also be desserts, forests, oceans, islands, and other land masses like that.    Those are just my opinions, so you may not like them. Now, to the review part if i haven't bored the reader already. :D-The dragons flying movements and speeds are perfect so far.-The realism with the villagers is spot on, and the cows are so cute that I haven't killed a single one so far.-It is fun to burn down villages, although my favorite part is eating the giblets of humans, wolves, giants, and goblins once they are dead.-The mountains are cool, and are really fun to glide off of as you burn down a village.   Thank you for this game and I really hope you don't give up on it. Even at this stage I feel the game will be absolutely perfect (with some minor tweaks).  ~UPDATE~ From watching the video and seeing the upcoming features, I have to admit this game is better than I had imagined it. Claiming territories is what I am most excited about so keep up the good work everyone!  ~UPDATE~ I can see that the developers are focused on fixing bugs and glitches, but I have an idea that I would love to see incorperated in the game as soon as possible. I think the game should be a little more fantasy focused. I believe that maybe you should make the dragons able to improve their atributes as they use it more. For example, if you always attack with fire, maybe the more you use fire, the more your dragon becomes one with it. In fairytail (an anime), Natsu called a dragon made up of flames his grandpa. I believe that if you use fire for at least 3/4 of your attacking, your dragon should be able to be ingulfed in flames, and you should be able to change the color of said flames. I also think that early in the game, prefferably while in dragon customization, you should be able to choose what you want your dragons element to be focused on. Like, in fairytail, there were wind dragons, water dragons, electric dragons, shadow dragon, light dragons, etc. that used their element in their breath attacks. I believe that should be done, and like the fire dragon, if they use their breath attacks 3/4 of the time in combat, then they should be their element (light, shadows, iron) in the shape of a dragon. I also believe that you should add other attacks such as a wing attack, some sort of tail attack, and more like it. Also, just like the breath attack, if say they use their claws 3/4 of the time in combat then they should be surrounded in spikes/quills that will do damage if one chooses to touch them, but the spikes/quills can be retracted with the key they choose in a keybinding menu. I believe that you should allow people to choose whether they want to be a human or a dragon in multiplayer so that they can fight against eachother, and you should add a place where dragons go to mate or lay eggs, somewhere that it would take time for humans to find it if they knew it existed.  I am very sorry about the long update, but I just have so many ideas for this game. I am jelous of the people that are working on it. If you want more ideas, please message me, for I have many ideas for this game, even though it is mainly focused on being a dragon. ^~^~Special shout out to my good friend RageBerry for always being there.~			"

								ESSENTIALS!!!This game is exactly the kind of game ALL dragon lovers will love and buy, and if urr like me, buy again, and again.However, and taking into account that the game is still in early stages of development, there are some essentials that need to be worked on. As a guy who has played almost all flight simulator and jetfighter games over the last decade or so, it is apparent to me that this game needs  a fresh new flight control and camera control system. A crash system for going too fast would also be a lovely touch. Anyway, these essentials will determine ease of player controls, comfort , and adaptation.  Not much else to say about this game other than it is gonna be biblical, and i genuinely think we're witnessing the making of dragon game genre history on this one. Don't let us down :D			"

But what this game does have is promise, I can picture it becoming something very interesting and very fun to play, as long as the devs DO NOT ABANDON IT! (Hint hint) If they stay focused on buffing out the bugs and completing the world, this game will be a success. If it were not for me thinking into the future, I would NOT recommend this game.Buy this game only to support the devsthere isn't much of another reason to buy it in this state.			"

Early Access Review
								I really want to like this game, I really really really want to!The concept is absolutely amazing. Sadly no big devs would ever consider it because it isn't mainstream enough and that is a shame.The last game that used that setting and idea is probably 15 years old by now and I would gladly pay 60€ for this one when it's finished BUT... why is there always a BUT...It was ""released"" in EA in November 2014. Back then it was, well, not even a tech demo, It was some sort of idea-showcase. Here, on the EA page they say this:Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?“Early Access will continue to our retail launch in the winter of 2016. We will follow an aggressive development road map with major release every three to seven weeks.”I do not know when they added that but it is safe to say that not even a gigantic professional AAA studio would be able to bring that game into a state that could be called ""finished"" AND including all promised feratures as well as being playable until Winter 2016.So, my personal opinion:The idea is awesome, the concept amazing, the effort enormous...If they finish it (without cutting content / releasing at 50% and selling the rest afterwards as DLC for full price) then this is probably a game that could go toe to toe with the big ones like Fallout (yes I know, everyone hates it, that's why it set several sales records) or MassEffect.Since it is highly doubtful that this will happen, my review is flagged as negative so it might prevent some people to buy and regret. Early Access is not ment for funding purposes so they can't rely on it to fund their project. Of course the review will change when the game gets finished and lives up to the promises.ADDENDUM 1: 12th of OctoberWell, there have been some patches since the initial review so I thought it might be a good idea to add my new impressions.Features: It seems like they try really hard to put, or rather force, in those things they promised. The quality of the implementation seems to reflect the ""force"" that is used. While there have been several additions to the game, the overall look and feel did not change.Gameplay: If you can get it to run at more than 6 FPS AND longer than 2 minutes, then the gameplay is still the main challenge. The controls are still wiggly-wobbly as a TARDIS with the handbrake on, but they seem to have improved at least a little bit. I can't play fluently or without a lot of effort but that might just be my personal experience.Graphics: I use a 8-core Bulldozer CPU and a 4 GB GTX980 with 16GB RAM but even on lowest settings the system struggles to deliver a decent FPS rate while the graphics remind me of Doom. Not the new one, or any sequel, but the first one. The one that came out 1993. So, no improvement on that part.So they say the final release will be winter 2016? I am praying for this game as I want it to fullfil all the promises it made and become the great game it could actually be, but at the moment, I am still staying true to my original recommendation of ""Not recommended"".

								I'm recommending this game because it seems to have a solid foundation and I'd like to see how the developers continue to make it good. Even though the early access version is a bit clunky control and camera-wise, it was pretty fun to fly around and mess up villagers. The flying wasn't slow (as long as the framerate wasn't screwing up), villagers and enemies were kill-able, and the houses were breaking when I played. The sound effects (roaring, flames, even the background music) were also better than I expected. Like someone else said this is more of a tech demo and I want to see the full game at some point down the line.			"

While the game is far in its infancy, and definitely not worth the money if you're looking for a game to play NOW, it will definitely be worth it to watch this game grow.

								First off, I would just like to address that as the indicator states above, THIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS REVIEW, and will be assessed as such.Dragon: The Game has great potential, great conceptualization and fantastic ambition. The idea behind an open world MMORPG/RPG that puts you in the position of being one of several fully customizable dragonkin is an amazing push towards online gameplay and single player experiences alike. Putting you at the helm of fully designing, developing and modifying your dragon-sona is something that hasn't been seen in the field.However, the development team is relatively slow compared to similar major Early Access games such as StarBound or The Long Dark, and more importantly, THE PRICE FOR THE EARLY ACCESS IS RIDICULOUS. Yes, it's wonderful to contribute to new developers, as the gaming field is a large and quickly growing industry that should be open to anyone who so wishes to explore it, but $17.99 for a game that is currently unplayable is not appropriate.That said, it's hard to see why such a basic game in this current stage is suffering from such a dramatically poor run-state. As you will see in other reviews, along with my own input, you really do need a near top-of-the-line operating system. Don't be fooled by the pretty commonplace system requirements - I apologize for not being able to tell you exactly why it doesn't run, but the performance, even at literally bare minimum skeletal optimizations, runs at about 8 fps at best on your average to decent gaming computer or laptop.However, I still am very excited to see the completion of the game. I am hoping that this problem array be addressed so that the game doesn't get criticized and ridiculed, but rather fixed and allowed to live up to its full potential. I still support this game, but cannot recommend it at this point in time. I do however, recommend that you keep up with this game!			"

Early Access Review
								I love the concept of this game.  It sounds fantastic and is exactly the kind of game I would love to get lost in for hours on end.  However, i get the impression that this game is going nowhere.When I purchased the game and ran it for the first time I was severely disappointed.  Trying to create a dragon resulting in constant crashes that were resolved by me just accepting the default dragon that appears when you first run the game.  I flew this dragon about and was amazed at how sloppy and almost useless the controls were.  Perhaps I chose a drunk dragon, or, worse yet, the one addicted to some really severe illegal drugs.  In any case, I got nowhere fast and, due to even more crashes, ended up not playing.Now, I fully realize that this is an early access game.  That being said, I decided to wait a couple months and try the game again.  During my absence I thought that some progress would be made by the devs and that I'd finally get in some play time.  This was not the case.  After two months of waiting I still could not log into the game, create a dragon, and play for 5 minutes without crashing.  So, I shelved the game again.It has now been several months (at least 6 or more) since I've tried this game.  I am in the process of downloading it again to see if any progress has been made toward my getting a somewhat playable product that I chose to support.  If I find that the game is indeed playable somewhat, I will let you know my findings.  If not, then heed this warning:This game is not playable.  Yes, I only have half an hour play time invested in the game according to steam.  Well, that is a half hour time that I was actually in the game and able to play between crashes.  Honestly, I've given this game at least 2 full days of play time trying to work around bugs, crashes, lock ups, and several other problems that plague the game.My system: intell I5 running at 3.4 ghz, 16 gigs of ram, and a geforce GTX 560 TI with 1 gig of dedicated video ram.My frame rate: less than 10 fps if you can get the game to run stable enough to measure the fps			"

Typical ametuer hour unity game that doesn't disable your mouse, so you're constantly fighting to keep it inside your game screen if you have multiple monitors or play in windowed mode. Lacks basics like mouse sensitivity settings and audio settings. Just garbage. No idea how anyone can give this game a positive review.There's absolutely no redeeming qualities to this game.			"

								At this point the game is mainly an investment as there is not much to do. I believe it has alot of potential and I do not regret my purchase. Development has been very slow, but the game still gets updated. The staff are very active in the community and theres no lack of communication.The game has been getting updated more frequently lately since the devs upgraded the engine, and you no longer need to switch to the beta to see the new features. Once again, the game is still an investment. However its slowly but surely looking more and more promising.			"

								   It's a scam. Are we really suppossed to believe that with all the funding that the early game excuse will pass at this point? The lack of communication is shady, we had to pay 15 dollars right off the bat without knowing what the end result was and you had the audacity after many hopeful people bought the thing to start a kickstarter for 30,000 dollars. You could have easily released a free test drive and worked on the game until it was finished, adding updates and listening to the community as you went along developing it, then when finished and start selling the final product based on how much you managed to get done and how many promised features you added. The thing crashes frequently, the interface is atrocious and a 10 year old could have designed a better interface. The save character feature that you say you implemented doesn't work. The programming is sloppy and the dragon model is ugly even with the 'new dragon models coming soon' thing that has been up in the corner as an advertisement for god knows how many months. It's infuriating how much of a scam this is and I want my damn money back. If this thing shows legitimate progress as a good game in the future I will buy it but my patience is finished and I am tired of the excuses.			"

But why in the god of sakes do i recommend it than? Because all the ideas that are brought up from the developers are just so great that i believe this might be one of the best games out there that is going to give you the possibilities of being a dragon and do what dragons do!I'm gonna give u some Pro's and Cons so that you can get a bit of a idea,Pro's:You can be a freakin DragonThe ideas are really goodThese developers are going to actually listen to you about what is going on and some possible ideasAnd it has Customization!Cons:The camera placement at the moment is really annoying (stuck in one place)The specs as i read are a bit high, what i mean is low spec pc's or laptop's will run the game on 5 Frames Per Second (also at the moment, they are fixing it)The graphics? well, meh. (since this is a Alpha of an Alpha i kind of get it though)Has as all Alpha's have: Much bugsI don't think you should buy this game yet if you expect the game to be in a really good condition. But still, the developers are actually busy doing stuff for us and for the second time: the ideas are just really good!That was it for now, if you plan to buy and actually want to screw around in the world then consider adding me :)			"

								I like the idea, but it is very poorly done.PROS: 1) your playing as a dragonthats about it....CONS:1) game runs VERY poorly even on top of the line machines, nearly impossible to run above 'fast' at even a half decent FPS.2) VERY little game content, basicaly Hunt, Eat, Grow, Repeat. (may be more but after 1.5 hours of trying to do the first two quests I got tired of it)3) had several instances of hard crashes for no apparent reason, usualy while flying.4) Flying is clumsy and awkward. (feels like it was designed for controler then mouse and keyboard)5) the bite attack is not bound to the proper hotkey, should be left mouse but is right mouse instead with no way to fix it without going into the game files.6) good luck finding a town, spent about 45 mins and two crashes trying to find one to finish the first quest.7) Spent more time flying trying to find ANYTHING to hunt, and when I do find somthing it usualy glitchs out and dissapears when I kill it.8) No way to do custom keybinds or change graphics settings after start up.9) UI need work but it's not the biggest problem with this game.10) the models and animations could use an overhaul.At this point I would NOT recommend this game in its current state for even $5 let alone $18.I won't say it's a dead game yet but it's starting to give me that impression with it's current rate of development or lack thereof.(I.E. no major changes or fixes in almost 6 months)			"

								Lovely game. Though it is obvious early development the potential is all there. Just the idea of, rather than being the brave knight that goes off and slays the dragon, but being the dragon who terrorizes, demolishes, and captures towns was very intriguing to me. Just the flight mechanics in general I am in love with. Though they may be a little buggy. But hey, that’s what early access is for. If you can’t fork out the money to buy this game at the moment I do suggest keeping an eye on it for the future.			"

								I LOVE THIS! I think the creators of this game are on to something...Anyway, it's cool and all, but I wish there was a little more. Like, in dragon creation, you should choose if you'd like to even have horns. And if you could be a wyvern, that would be AWESOME! I, personally, think that wyvern dragons are the best dragons, because of Smaug. The camera is a littla wierd as well. I think that, on the ground, you should be able to look up and down, with out pressing the camera button, that's just my opinion.I also think it would be cool if the enemies and villigers turned into ragdolls when killed, then you could loot their bodies for gold coins, weapons and armor, and all the stuff you got off their bodies would go to your hoard. The more stuff you have, the badder dragon you are. And then after looting the bodies, you just eat them right then and there.These are just a few ideas that would make this awesome game, AWESOMER! If that's even a word, which it is now! TO THE CREATORS OF DAGON: PLEASE TRY TO IMPLEMENT THESE IDEAS INTO THE GAME! IT WOULD BE SOOO AWESOME IF YOU DID!			"

								While it is still Early Access,the game still can change a lot to be better as of now.While it is fun flying around, at the current state, I do not recomend this game to anyone,who has experienced Motion sickness in any game before. I myself had little problem with it before, this game however forced me to take a break rather fast, after I started from the side of a hill....I strongly recommend to wait for a later version where the dragon does not  fly with one wing touching the ground and one reaching into the sky after launching from an area that enables you to do exactly that.I hope this will be fixed. but of now it is a no go.--------------------------------While this problem was kind of fixed by setting the horizontal allignment as constant, it still can be bugged by doing some flight stunts.I just hope this is a temporary fix and the devs are really gonna think about how they will set the ""phasechange"" from standing/walking to flying (something that is really needed)The change they did with that so far is not a good permanent solution and not even a waypoint to it...While the change gives a sign that they are still working, I have to wonder about those methods...

								Dragon: The Game wants to be something really great.  ""A dragon RPG?"" you might ask yourself.  ""Can it be true?""The answer: I think it is. We hope it is.I haven't found any other dragons yet but you can smash up the countryside and snatch villagers and their cattle, pigs,etc.  Grabbing the deer is fun and Combat requires that you line-up your attacks.  It is cool when you can swipe 5 villagers down with a well placed tail swipe and when I'm a bigger dragon I'll be able to smash even more!I got this game after watching a developer livestream on twitch.  It's a good price for what this game will become over the next year or two.  Once eating and ""leveling up"" are in the game could really take off.   I will say I like where the soundtrack is going but we need more tracks to be sure.PS. We need more breath attacks. Where is the fireball, frost breath, and acid we're all dreaming of?PPS. Will dragons get bigger when they eat?? "

								I bought this game on December 1st 2014, and have not seen any improvement from when i got the game, if anything it feels worse. When it first came out there was very little content but I could fight goblins, destroy buildings, and eat humans and cattle, the flight controls were hard but i managed to fly around and explore the terrain. Now it is utterly broken, the controls are just as hard, the game lags everytime you move the mouse, which makes hunting and fighting impossible. The buildings seem to be indestructable now as i fly right through them, i couldn't kill two humans as the dragon couldn't be aimed to hit them with fire and the ground movement makes biting or tail striking extremely dificult. Also when I first purchased the game any time you killed something you could press E and the dead creature would disappear leaving peices of meat you could eat, it was fun to chase down the parts, now you have to hold the E key for at least twenty seconds for your dragon to consume the creature, for next to nothing as a reward. During this time you cannot let go of the key or move without having to restart the process. I have witnessed a game go backwards through the development process. It was not worth the money i spent on it.			"

								I only played like 10 seconds of this game before it crashed on me (using a mac book pro) but already I am having a great time with it. Not because it's great, in fact it's in early access and it shows, but because i'm a F*%king DRAGON! the simple fact that these beautiful people at Red Level are even trying to make this game brings me all sorts of jollys. I do recomend this game even with all of it's faults. I do this because I have been watching it for years now and it seems to realy be picking up some momentum. (In comparison to the slower than snail dung pace of the before times) I also don't agree with the assumption that you should automaticaly give a game a thumbs down just because it's not finished, it is in early access after all and reveiws do have an effect on peoples buying habits as well as the moral of the developers. I for one want to see this game reach it's fullest potential and for it to do so it needs our support. There is a kickstarter out there if you are interested and dont want to buy an unfinished game, but then why not just buy the game when it's on sale and reap all the free updates? if this game lives up to half of what Red Level is bravley, if a bit brazenly, trying to accomplish then it will be more than worth $60. As of my writing this you can get the game for $15. it's a bit much for an early access game and i dont recomend this game to anyone who is spending their only game money till payday to try and tide themselves over. But if you are looking to get in on the ground level of some pretty fantastic shiz this game is a go.For my final and most important point: Because dragons.P.S. i will be writing more reveiws of this game as i play it more and as updates come out.Update:I have now owned and played this game for a while and there was a patch recently that fixed a lot of the baisic bugs. Every month there is a new patch and every month this game looks a little bit more like what it is supposed to be. This game is not a simple indie project and honestly it would take a AAA game company ten years to develop something on the scale of what Dragon: the game is promising. Anyone who thinks this game should be even close to finished after two or three years has no idea what it takes to build a game. Some people will fire back that the developers should not have released the game in early access at this stage. I disagree, Red Level is a brand new developer with very few recources and they are tackling an immense project while having to maintain their lives. Puting this game out in early access is a way to generate revenue and allow those who are interested in this type of game to check out what Red Level has done so far as well as get involved with the development process. Giving this game a bad reveiw because it is unfinished is like being upset that you got fish from a fish market. It is still in its very early stages of development and as i said before it shows. however early access is not for people who want a finished game.In the end:Buy this game if you love dragons and like to watch as a game grows from idea to fully realized universe.Dont buy this game if you are impatient and want a finished game.

Its very very rough, but Duh, its an alpha! Only buy this game if you want to support a truly awesome concept that can turn into an amazing game.

								I bought this game in early alpha, and I am so excited to see what it will become. Of course, you should not buy this game if you don't like how buggy it is, which it obviously will be. I love being able to fly in the game, it is very nice. Dragon customization can be a little difficult when you can't even see your dragon as you're customizing it. Some suggestions would be to add more variety in the land. Wherever I go, I only see mountains. Snowy areas or jungles would be amazing.  It would also be nice to have large structures such as castles, caves, rivers, lakes. I hope I don't come off as terribly picky, but I have high hopes in this game.			"

I am very frustrated because it is not complete yet, but since I've bought it as an early access game, I have input for the creators to use, which would be less helpful for a fully-developed game. Seeing other players' comments make me feel at home, especially since I'm as crazy about chasing after chickens and swooping down on bears and mountain trolls as the next fan. I even managed to land on the last troll's head and roast him until he exploded into chunks of yumyum, upgrading meat (yay for bugs, or just dumb luck)!

								I've got this game in my library due to backing the Kickstarter a few months ago. I'd like to say it's a good game. Unfortunately, I can't say anything about it because it flat-out doesn't work on Linux. At least, it doesn't work on Debian 8 as of the latest update (July 7, 2016, version 8.5), nor has it worked the entire time I've had it. It just shows a magenta screen after the Unity logo with some nice nature sounds in the background, but I can't click on or interact with anything. It may work on Windows or Mac OS; I haven't tried it there, other people's reviews may be more useful. But at the moment it's completely broken on Linux and there doesn't seem to be any push to fix it. This may someday be a good, even great game, but if you're a Linux gamer, avoid it for now.			"

Early Access Review
								The concept of Dragon the game is very fun, but concept alone does not make a viable product.  This game has been in development for a very long time and has made little progress.When you purchase an early access game you are telling a developer that you believe in their product and therefore want it to succeed.  Unfortunately this trust has been taken advantage of all too often and has led many to distrust the early access program.  I am unsure if the developers for Dragon have done so intentionally or not, but they have done so.  Infrequent updates, bugs, and many more problems riddle this game.The character creation process has changed very little in two years and it seems that anything you do to the dragon shapes and sliders and color have no effect.  Additionally no matter what color (black, red, blue, etc) dragon you choose the game will label it as a green dragon.The camera is too difficult to work with and turns what should be an exciting experience of flying over villages mountains and forests into something much more frustrating.  Your view is limited to right behind the dragon, and because it is so close it obstructs most of the viewing field.  It led to me dying several times because I had no idea that I was being attacked.Please do not buy this game.			"

								There is SO much potential for this game, and I mean, so much that this could blow up easily and become something great. However, the game in its current form is as alpha as it can get. It's very buggy, many things need to be worked on. But the devs seem really caring about it so I have no doubt that this will fail. It will take tons of patience, for the team and the players for it to develop any further. As far as I know they're the first that's come out with a game like this: deeply customizable dragons that you can play as in a wide, open world. So far they are doing a great job with introducing this game to the world. Baby steps!If you are purely wanting to buy this game to play, I would not recommend it (there's not much to do except flying and breathing fire). However, if you want to support the development of a possibly AMAZING addition to Steam, then do it and help make this game something ♥♥♥♥in SWEET!			"

								I would warn people away from this game until it has actually implemented a successful feature. The game looks nothing like the video, and lacks functionality in every aspect, from movement and character creation to physics and damage.This game has quite an imaginative and entrancing concept, but is not equipped to deliver anything at all.

								Since apparently 10 minutes of gameplay is an insufficient amount of time to add credibility to a review of a game that literally consists of nothing but flying around and burning things, here is my second, hopefully better recieved review.  After flying around the rather large yet not limitless world and mastering the flying system (which is very simple and easy to figure out), I set to burning every house and creature in sight.  Garnering over 1300 xp, I found that there is not a leveling system as of yet.  I also found that flying at high speed into the ground will glitch you into a wierd angle until you restart the world.  The village people are often immortal, and come back from the dead after you kill them.  In conclusion, this is not a game that you should buy if you are looking for another fun game to play. However, if you are interested and willing to watch and help a game along and make it into a great addition to your Steam library, then I recommend you do purchase it.  You may say that it is a waste of money, I say it is an investment.  Right now, the only actions you can perform are flight and fire breath, as well as a melee attack, there are no sounds, and bugs are like part of the gameplay. but this is how every game starts out.  Now, I think I'll go play some Warframe while I eagerly await the November 14th update of Dragon.			"

Early Access Review
								Don't give this clown another penny.I bought this game the day it was released on Steam: Nov 7th, 2014. Until today, April 1st, 2017 I had a positive review as I loved the concept and saw the developer doing the right things. That persisted for a while and I was happy to patiently wait for the game to develop and was looking forward to testing and giving feedback as updates came out. I'd say for about 6 months or so things were going as I'd expect from a small indie developer and I had no complaints. Then communication more or less stopped. Radio silence from the developer, updates far and few between. I kept the faith for a quite a while as I could see some life on rare occassion, a kickstarter campaign and some communication outside of steam. It has only gotten worse as over time though, and I can't in good consciounce prop up this dead horse any longer. Myself and others have supported this dev in good faith through EA purchase on steam and backing on Kickstarter, this title has an amazingly positive and patient community and yet for some reason this developer feels they don't owe any accountability to us. If at some point the developer decides to act like a developer and actually act like he works for and owes some kind of accountability to the people who have faithfully supported him for years, I will happily come back and change my review back to a positive one. I've been telling this guy to talk to his community for almost two years now though, so I'm not holding my breath. He has shown how little respect or appreciation he has for his supporters, we're literally not worth a couple minutes a month of his time. The forums have shown this to be the common sentiment for years, he just doesn't care.In the unlikely event the dev reads this, I'm your customer and your publisher Grant. Treat me like a person, not a wallet. Your dismissiveness to myself and the rest of your supporters has been deeply insulting. If you can't be bothered to report on the project we funded from time to time then please don't bother asking the public at large to fund a project again.			"

								If you're expecting a alpha/beta that feels like a completed game ,come back later.If you want to feel the derpiness of how it is ,go right ahead and laugh as you look at some of the stuff there.There are various obvious signs of promising unimplimented features such as the customization menu ,the somewhat scattered presence of human inhabitance ,and the promise of your dragon being able to grow ,ranging from a young drake to an ancient.Promise or not ,only get it as quick as I did if you want to take a charting of what already exists. *edited for accuracy ,as somethings I had earlier just didn't make sense*			"

								BIG FUTURE! Though this game is in pre alpha/ alpha stage it has tons of potential. Buyer beware though..this is a unfinished product. I give it 2.5 stars (out of 5) in alpha, but will upgrade my rating via the updates. I certainly hope its creators take it to its full potential. On a personal note: I would love to see some sort of ""creation"" system mechanic such as lairs, treasure hordes, and the like. From what I read, its creators are on the right track which is why I bought it. I highly recommend this game if your into dragons killing baddies, but if want a finished product with all the bells and whistles hold your money and bad opinions so not to tarnish the product or stifle the creators. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK and ROCK ON!			"

								As of right now in it's current state I cannot honestly recommend this game. It is largely unpolished even for an early access game, and half the time you either run into bugs and glitches or the game just stops working.However, this game has big promise and a great concept behind it so if you're ok with it's current state and want to support it's development then I would suggest getting it on sale. The game has already recieved huge support and funding on kickstarter but it still has a long way to go.That being said, flying around and burning things can be quite theraputic. I will update this review as more updates come out.			"

								A Truly fantastic concept. Maybe some day someone will be able to realize it. That day, is not today. Dragon suffers from some horrendous setbacks that even some of the shoddiest Early Access titles can't make claims to. It's glitchy, laggy, handles abysmally, has extremely poor models and animation, and worst of all has made very little progress in development. In fact, this recent update seems to have stripped several previously added ""features"" (if they may even be called such), taken away the previous, somewhat customizable dragon model, and given us a rather horrid mess. The game now lags even worse, with even more terrible flight controls and physics than before. A step back in almost every regard. Maybe, if this game can survive a year and gain some good, solid updates, it might be able to at least succeed in proposing the idea of this concept. That, of anything here, is the one thing that deserves to survive.			"

								It is an awful game. The controls tend to be clunky. The view distance is ridiculously short. The world is is bland and featureless. The character creation system is poorly thought out. It delivers none of what is says. Even an early access game should be better than this. I have put in a request for a refund. The single most disapointing game in years. I've been waiting for the exact sort of game these devs promised for over a decade. Guess I won't be getting it any time soon.			"

I hope to see this game doing well in the future.			"

								The first thing I'm gonna say is that you can't look up or down when you're on the ground; that's a problem when your in a 3D environment. Also, the controls don't work well with a track-pad and there's no way to aim your attacks if you're not flying. Finally, the fact that there are no options for mouse sensitivity, key binds, or even sound volumes is incredibly problematic. Overall, the game in its current state is hardly worth 2 dollars, and the camera angles and controls should be fixed ASAP, not in SEVEN MONTHS FROM NOW.I really want this to be a good game, but right now it's just a pain in the neck for me. If I knew programming, I'd opt to pitch in to fix this, but all I'm good as is concept art and storyboarding at the moment.			"

								When I first got this game, I enjoyed it and despite the lack of content then, it was easy to play actually but hard to learn. When I first started playing, the trailer was fairly accurate. Now? Heh, trailer is a lie.The game has the mouse on-screen the entire time, its overly bright, you can't tell when something's dead or alive......the game isn't fun anymore. Heck, it's unplayable.I was really hoping this game would become awesome and super fun to play within a short timespan because I really wanted a game like this but instead.........its gone backwards from the trailer. It is now unplayable, ugly, too bright and impossible to learn the controls. Heck, you can't even change them I think (don't qoute me on that).All in all, unless the Devs put some serious time back into this game (which has a really awesome concept to it), don't waste your money on this piece of garbage.0/10 now7/10 WHEN THE GAME MATCHED THE TRAILER!

								Its /somewhat/ enjoyable as it is, Alpha, there are a lot of holes and errors, so its to be excpected. That said, for the 1/2 minutes it was working correctly before I had to restart, I enjoyed myself. The flying is dynamic, and i love swooping around at breakneck speed to deliver a payload of flames upon the helpless villagers. So far, ive killed a troll, and many humans, and i can say, if you have any compitance as a fighter, you should still beat them no sweat, even if you dont youll win anyway. The only real issue /I/ have so far is the camera skrews up a lot, custimization is rediculasly un-usable, and you cant save progress, chat box glitchs, and alot of stuff glitches. But its Alpha, so all these thing im sure will be handled, recently added music and its pretty cool.My two cents. "

If I could see progress being made I'd be happy but there has been no update for several months and even before that progress was slow. The game is currently empty and boring, once you've flown around a couple of times you've basically seen and done everything there is. There are free to play games that are 100x better.

								Okay so I know this game is in early access so I am still in high hopes that this might turn out good. BUUUUUUT, right now the game is NOT at it's full potential. Not even close. First off the second I get in the game it lags like crazy unless I have all the graphics options ALL the way down. I know it's not my computer because I have one of the best computers on sale (not to brag). Then there's the lair and landmark thing but the devs are working on it so I will leave that alone. I WILL however, address what is probably the most important aspect of the game, the dragons. Or should I say, the lack of them. From what I have seen from the game there are no dragons other than you. Regardless of where you are. From what ive seen there aren't even bad guys other than villagers (excluding the animal life) and they can get 1 hit by you. I will also leave the grabbing thing alone because that is also explained as buggy in the game and I do hope they improve on it. This game also REALLY REALLY REALLY needs an in game map. That shows the landmarks and lairs. I don't know whether or not I am going in circles or actually going somewhere half the time. There is also no tutorial, which will be a big problem for new players. Right now thought the game isn't really complex enough for a tutorial. The objectives and quest are definitely a no-go. They are too simplistic, I mean cmon! You are a DRAGON! Why do you have to eat 10 wolves here, or 5 rabbits there? The goals need to be higher. Like idk maybe have a quest be to fight a patrol of soldiers roaming the countryside. Right now though there isn't anything else to do because of all the reasons above. Then there's the multiplayer option. I tried to make it work. BUT, of course that didn't work either. It said I need a group name. No matter what I did it always said it was being used. I literally just spammed a bunch of random letters and it told me it was already used. Like seriously I just did this aoifhisacybf8uisyf87wo yvr091yu390rconusdlfumx92uf9w and it still said it was already being used. I honestly don't think enough people even play this game for a normal group name to even not be available. Then there's the lack of a sovereign (and everything else NPC wise other than villagers and these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking wolves). I know it SAYS there is one but there isn't even a castle or building other than these really fat looking huts for the villagers and piles of twigs for wolf dens. There are probably many other problems with this game I don't even know about. All of these problems I got from playing barely more than hour of this game. I mean come on! This game right now is pathetic. It's not worthy of anyone's respect or time. BUT, the game DOES have SO MUCH POTENTIAL! Potential that is sadly not being used. I can't speak for anyone else but this game is not worth 17 bucks. Right now, it's worth like 4 cents. Probably less. Actually the devs of this game should be paying US to play this game. But, I say again, I have high hopes that this game will turn out good. I also REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLY hope the devs of this game don't abandon this game. it has a lot to work on though, and the devs aren't fixing any of the problems by the looks of it and just adding more and more crap that won't work. If they are trying to fix it then the devs definitely need to think of a different job than videogame making. This game has, and I can't say this enough, A LOT OF POTENTIAL. But right now, this is an insult to the gaming society. IF they turn the game around, fix the lag and the bugs, make more buildings, make the present buildings look LESS like someone just got lazy and slapped a bunch of brown texture together and tripled it's size, actually DO the things they say they will, then my review MIGHT change. But for right now this game just wasn't worth my money. AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF the game isn't updating itself as it is supposed to. So my version of the game is permanently stuck at the 8.04 version. Which means the game itself is refusign to even leave Early Access. Even the game knows it sucks. I MAY change my tune if the creators of this game give me a FULLY updated version of the game and a version that updates ITSELF.			"

The game has a lot of potiental to easily be a great dragon game. Will it be more fun as it completes? Yes. Is it worth the buy now? I think so. It keeps food i nthe dev's bellies and gives them more time to work on the game itself instead of possibly havign a second job to buy for things they need.I give this game my total and complete recommendation for buying and folling about in.

I however had fun exploring and have great hope that it will continue to improve in the coming weeks and months. The concept of playing in an open world rpg from the dragons perspective is uncommon so I purchased the game to show my support. My first impressions of the game where marred by menu glitches here and there, all of which have been discussed long before my review. (its a WIP, no problems that will last forever) As I expect by weeks end said early glitches will be forgotten history, I remain hopeful for what is yet to come. I can't wait to watch it grow and grow with it, to the developers I'm rootin for ya!			"

								As of now, this game remains largely unpolished and unprepared for the final release. It has been several months and not a lot of progress has been made, either. I hope this will change in the future. But for now? Not really worth the price unless you are prepared to wait for ages and ages to see it, maybe, become something playable.			"

								This could really be good if the developers keep working.  You can fly around and bloww fire, and fight peasants.  They fight back but they can't hurt you. I wish you could fly faster, but maybe they will fix that. I'd say support this game, because the idea is really good and it can be fun.			"

								There isn't much to do in this, but they have improved the mechanics and I can see this game going really far. You get to play as a dragon, with loads of options as to how you are to progress! If you've always wanted a dragon RPG game, I would support the developers and buy it, and just come back when it's finished! I've jumped in a few times over the past bit of time and you can tell they love this game, and it'll be amazing once they have more content thrown in.			"

								This game is probably one of the best ideas I have seen in a long time. A dragon based rpg where you get to fly around as a dragon is fun regardless of if it is co-op or not. I personally can't wait for the update on november 14nth to see how they made this game allready more fun than its current stage. 10/10 would breathe fire again.			"

								I purchased this game the day it became available. There are a lot of reviews here commenting on the lack of updates and general unplayability of the game. However, seeing the progress that the developers have made since day one has been nothing short of impressive to me. Unfortunately they had to take quite a few steps back from the original release to rebuild an stronger foundation to build in the features that will eventually make this game great.On the surface, it made the game a lot less playable for quite some time, but now that the team has developed a more substantial frame on which to build the game, the updates have been coming in pretty frequently and with each one comes more playability and more promise for the future. I know that the dev team is working hard and I have a lot of faith and hope for this team and this game in the future.			"

								Well, it's still early access so don't expect much. That said, the game(at least for me) holds a lot of potential. The creation menu seems like it'll be quite interesting when it's fully developed. I'm very interested in seeing how my Dragon will grow from a young drake into an Ancient one. Or how I can ally or destroy human settlements. The gameplay may seem a bit repetitive even after it's fully released but I'm sure they'll put in new breath attacks and maybe some unique claw/tooth upgrades. In conclusion, if you're a fan of dragons you should totally wait around for this game and get it when it's released.			"

***REVIEW AS OF 11/11 EARLY ALPHA***You remember when at E3 they show incredibly early concepts for games like Shadow of the Colossus and it was literally just an old Ico model on a horse running by a giant squareish Bull with an angry face? Remember what a cool game that turned out to be after all the hard work?That's what I think this game is going to be. Right now it's bare as hell bones with just access to minimal customization and flying mechanics but there's a lot of proof that there is plenty more to come and that's what's keeping me here. If you don't want to just be a part of the creating process wait a while to buy it. But keep your eye on this one. I think it's going to be great.			"

								Great game. Even though it is still really small amount of things you can do, you can do most of the things true dragon can (fire breath, flying, eating livestock and/or villagers) which makes time fly by, even if objectively there's little you can do.Dragon's flying model is great, though you can't do loops de loops or barrel rolls. I've used 99.9% of my time so far in the game just to fly around. You should buy it right now and see for yourself how great this game is!			"

								I like the idea of this game.  It is a Dragon Sandbox, and if you played AD&D at all, or perhaps read some of those real popular novels in the late 80s that launched the Dragonlance franchise, the idea behind this game might appeal to you all the more.    Now, I am going to press <enter> and I'm going to indent so that you will see that there is an important point about to be made.  Please take the few seconds to read it.  Please don't skim.  I will refrain from using all caps this time.        This game is not in Alpha yet.  This game is not a game yet.   This game can only be called a work in progress at the moment     This game is very nebulous at the moment.  Be advised: if you to buy a complete Dragon: The Game, wait.   However, if you are  as intrigued as I was by the game concept as I was and wish to -contribute- and -invest- in the game's future, by all means, buy.  I think that the nebulous nature of the game at this point is a selling point.  Buying in now gives you a say, at the ground floor, in how the game develops.  I have ideas bubbling out of my ears, and you will find that many other people do as well if you look at the game Forums.  I envision a game that barely skirts getting sued for copyright infringement, where time tested (and gamer approved) Dragon Concepts are incorporated into the game (for instance, a set number of ""Good"" dragon colors and a set number of ""Evil"" dragon colors, as an example.  I will recomend this game for those that have the money to spend and want to help.  I do not recomend this game for those looking for another victory notch on their belt after they ""beat"" the game in twelve hours.   Just one last comment on the growing number of people that adding helpful, proactive posts on the forums for this game.    It's easy to gripe about a game's flaws.  But it is a far far better thing to actively help the devs and the players for no other reason than to see the nebulous become concrete.    "

								This is exacty the game I've been waiting years to see. THIS IS AN ALPHA STAGE GAME, AND IS NOT PERFECT. What game is even perfect anyways?As of Build 0.77a, the mechanics are getting better.PROS-Flying is great and feels nice-New fire looks a ton better-Largeish open world to fly around inI won't put any cons in, but i do have some suggestions for the creator:SUGGESTIONS:-Have the camera angle controlled by the mouse, like other 3rd person games (Thinking of Just Cause 2, Batman Arkham series) . Scrolling in and out should control zoom like how it is now, but having to press the scroll button to zoom and move the camera is annoying. ==OR== Have static camera like is now, but have player hold left alt to move camera (like DayZ).-The running speed should be a little quicker, but that's just a personal preference. Seems a little sluggish as of now.-Castles. -Caves in the mountain side that player can use as lair i.e. spawn point. Multiple throughout world? Have hoard of gold inside to show off to other players, stolen from castles. Maybe a princess or two.-Maybe a way that dragon can remain in air static, like just floating and not moving forwads or backwards. -Have a way to control the dragons head. Like say the player is flying and stops by a house. They hover in the air (holding space?) and then direct the head towards a building (holding L ctrl and moving the mouse) and shoots flames and burns down the house. villagers come and and the player could just move the mouse to move the dragons head to attack the villagers below them. (Controls given optional)-Minimap icons for enemies and wildlife should be smaller. They block the view from everything else and approximating distance at first was difficult.With that said, it's a great game and every update keeps me excited for what's next. I know this game will be good once the developers give it the time and love it needs, as well as the community giving great feedback. Cheers.			"

								Dragon: The Game. I purchased this mid 2015 expecting a good portion of time to go by before it was what it promised to be. But holy cow, almost two years in and literally the only noticable changes are grass textures and a beginning game ""alpha build"" tab which basically tells you, quite poorly, that the game is still being developed and to not rage on them for being in alpha build. If this game was at least playable with terrible graphics and no real story that would be one thing. But the truth of the matter would appear that this ""game"" is being made by a few high school kids with less than 5 hours a week to really put any kind of noticable attention into the developement. In no way am I saying i could do it better, but I also have the common decency to not sell my dogs♥♥♥♥♥♥labeled as Chocolate.I say all this not out of rage, but dissapointment. I wanted this game to be awesome. I feel that I've been very patient in recognizing that this is a very ambitious project. But taking money from gamers and doing almost nothing noticable with so much time passing by is downright stealing in my mind.To the developers of Dragon: The Game, Find out what the developers of The Forest are doing, because they too are still in Alpha Stage and not only is thier game fluid, fun, and good looking, it's an incomplete game which still provides fans their moneys worth. Unlike your product which provides no refund, no functional gameplay, and a bad taste in your mouth about future purchases of alpha build games.			"

								Sure, development is moving VERY slowly (Slower than molasses at Absolute Zero) but if you look at the potential, this game has a lot. It's a shame, this game kind of blows right now since you can't do very much at all. But once again, it has potential and I most definitely support the title.As to bash the negative reviews because it's angering to see what people are writing, here's a scenario to put what people are doing into perspective:Let's introduce ""Team 1"" - This team is trying to innovate upon ideas for a cleaning product. Team 1 has just announced and released a beta for their new product, ""Grime Killer"".Now we introduce ""User 1"" and ""User 2"" - User 1 is someone who isn't the sharpest knife in the box and doesn't read instruction manuals or any other helpful texts. User 2 is someone who does read the fine print or manual of a product, but simply does not care about it.Team 1 has clearly written in the fine print, ""WARNING: THIS PRODUCT IS IN EARLY ACCESS. IT IS NOT COMPLETED AND WILL NOT REFLECT THE FINAL ATTRIBUTES OF THIS PRODUCT!"" - However, User 1, being the dimwit he is, did not read the fine print. He comes along thinking that this is a full blown product that is already released into the wild for everybody to use. When he posts his review online, it is very short. Although it reflects what he saw, he gives the product one star because it did not work like other cleaning products that were already finished. His review is very short and unrelaible. Many people like User 1 will rate-up the review.Shortly after, User 2 - already deterred by User 1's unreliable review - purchases the product anyway. He is aware that the cleaning product is not done. He sticks with it for a very long time because Team 1 states they are working on improving its performance, and User 2 is curious to see where it leads. Unfortunately, Team 1 has not been releasing new versions of the product all too often. Due to many deterrants (i.e. User 1's review and the fact that the product is not done), funding has not been very reliable for this product. At this point, User 2 decides that ""This product sucks!"" because they cannot feed his impatience or desire for frequent updates to the product.Now to bash the company with references to Portal (Valve)You guys are a lot like Aperture Science: You promise a LOT, but only live up to a fraction of what you promised. If you have ideas, keep them to yourself until you're sure you can get it done.			"

I do not recommend buying it at this time, unless you wish to support them. As said, it's still early access, so it brings loads of bugs, and funky modeling. TL;DR: It's unique and fun, and I can't wait for more. There's so much potential in this game. But as of now, it's extremely early, and doesn't seem close to being complete.			"

								Ever since the recent patches i cant help but play this game every day, its epic and i love it, i cant wait till they release more playable lands and pvp, etc. There is bad things too though of course, Like some of the lands are not built properly and still the shaders are kind of sucky, but overall this game is pretty fun, i cant wait till the next patch :)			"

								Well lemme get started, if you're looking to buy this game for gameplay, Don't buy it, it is VERY early access and pretty laggy and it looks pretty.... bad I guess. But I see SO MUCH POTENTIAL! The concept is great and if you want to support the dev's I would buy it. Idk just my opinion			"

								The game doesn't work for Linux.  Linux users should stay away for now.  All you will see is a lot of a pink screen.   If you don't believe me, buy it and find out....   I will happily update this review when it changes, however, I'm tired of standing up for Red Level until they show me something worth while.			"

								i purchased this game hoping to be a dragon however i can't say i got to be one as my vary first experience ended with me attempting to pick up a rock then suddenly clipping threw the world as my character modal became a spazzy amorphous blob while falling in to eternity, so long story short if you want to play as a dragon go play Istaria its well worth what little money they ask of you in exchange for the bad♥♥♥♥♥dragon you can become.

								I'm going to start off by telling people who have made not recommended reviews how to play. You have to create a dragon, name it, and then press the arrows to select that name before you can click the new game/ join game buttons.So far there isn't much. You can fly around. you can kill things, you can minorly customize your dragon, if things die you can eat the red meat cubes that drop to heal, you can breath fire, you can bite and you can scratch. The world is small. Other than that ther isn't much until more updates come up, but that doesn't make it bad. They are adding small things at a frequent pace at the moment, so that is good. It is a very early alpha release so none of these things are bad. They are good, because you can actually do stuff! Game will be good if it keeps on updating at this pace in 6+ months. I'll recommend it for people who want to watch it grow.			"

								Thus far, the game isn't all that bad for early alpha. Nonetheless, I shall submit my little review.I don't particularly like the flight mechanics, it seems too much like a plane instead of a dragon. That being said, I hope that those mechanics will change.The npc's are so far so good, even though every single one wants to kill you at this point.The map is actually quite nice, however I usually have to go out to the newer regions because of lag.Yes, this is an early access game and isn't perfect. Hopefully, the game will be done right and be absolutely amazing when it comes out. If you want a better game, be patient and wait. If you want to help out with the development, go ahead and play.

								While lacking much on the features that seem to be advertised, they have been incredily consistent in updating and adding new content with each update and hotfix. The gameplay is solid, if not incredibly simple, at the moment; fly around, kill things, eat things, repeat. I look forward to other game mechanics such as taking/maintaining/defending a territory, hording gold, refined character customization and a perk tree. I've sunk a lot more money into early access games from long ago and haven't even had two updates. I'm glad to see this development team trying their hardest to deliver what they promised for the $18 I paid.			"

								Good luck guys in creating the game, all I wan't to say as something for ideas is1: More elemental dragons (Electric, Sun, etc, and also include the ability to mix dragons!). 2: Ability to create caves, and a tracker to locate the cave as home to store stuff, maybe if the cave gets attacked, etc. 2: Better graphics for the dragon, maybe make it look like the dragon is actually turning instead of a statue moving from your cursor 3: There needs to be something where you could be able to morph into 1 other thing if you are a SUPER high level dragon (Maybe a simple customizer, nothing too complicated). BACKSTORIES!!! That would be the best thing available for roleplayers. Anyways, those are my NEW tips, thanks.Just some ideas, thanks.			"

								The amount of options given even in Alpha is so promising. Head and body changes, I hope we get more than that too, such as being able to change body scales and belly scales to something different. It would be best for them to make a greyscale texture for both meshes and just let us go crazy with tints. I also hope we'll be about to customize the face a lot more than what's given, cause I am not a fan of the horn set up for my dragon. Still, get it when you can guys, so you can always track it and offer imput into the creation of the game!			"

								I don't have too much to say about ""Dragon: The Game"" as I've barely been able to put any time into it, but I'll say what I can.If you are looking to play a really awesome game where you can be a dragon and do all sorts of dragon related things, and you're looking to play it right now, you had better have an absolutely top of the line computer, or else you should look somewhere else.My machine isn't a gaming PC by any stretch of the imagination, but it's so far been able to run every game I've thrown at it at some graphics level. This game runs a solid 5fps at maximum on the lowest possible graphics setting, making it impossible to actually play. There are so many cool features being talked about and so much great footage out there from this game, but it just isn't optimized enough to experience any of it firsthand.The ideas behind this game are superb and considering the early state of development, I'm going to give it a recommendation purely on concept. But I want to make it very clear that buying this game is a long-term investment. Unless you have an incredibly powerful PC, this game is not currently playable.Now go forth and do what you do.***UPDATE 1/5/2016***The game has gone through a considerable amount of updates since my last time playing and last review, and it has improved. However, this improvement is still not enough to render the game playable.In my initial review, I discussed framerate and blamed my computer for it. Playing now, the framerate is considerably better even though the game has had a significant amount of content added. This tells me that it was not, in fact, my computer being lazy, but the poor optimization of the game.Sound has been added, the camera is slightly less wonky, and it's actually possible to navigate menus now. But this is still FAR from a playable game. If you decide to buy this game, consider it a long term investment. This product should be considered no more than a tech demo in it's current state.			"

								I could recommend this game, but in it's current state: No.There is 0% gameplay right now. I flew around for a short time and it was really easy to learn how to fly. I found some buildings but no humans to oppose me.The animations are not pleasing, when you fly your wings move slowly and not really making me feel like I'm trying to fly.The best way to get a reference in animation is to look at other products like the dragons in World of Warcraft. When they fly they make it very believable that it's hovering and flying.The walking animation is fine but your back legs make you look like you just took a huge dump and you ran out of toilet paper. The wings when you walk look ridiculous, like you've broken them.Major Issue: You are RIDICULOUSLY Tiny. You are SMALLER than the entrances to houses and it doesn't matter what type of dragon you start with, Young or Ancient are just as ""big"".The Fire Breath is just one sprite that get shot out every tick. And if you fly and breathe fire then turn around away from it, you can end up with 1fps, and I am running on a high end gaming rig.Also; You can fly under the map. My reaction when I figured this out was: No, that did not happen...All in all they tried to make a game, but as we can see it's WAY too early to release it on steam early access. This isn't even 5% finished.Should you buy it? Yes! In it's current state? No.It's got great potential and promise because it's a game where you are a DRAGON. Well more like a winged lizard the lenght of a horse and the height of a dog but.I don't know if I should recommend this or not, but I am going to put Yes on it. "

								Having no hopes of this game beeing playable I was pleasantly surprised. Allthough currently it is not a game, but more of a  preview. More or less only flying around, testing out flying and burning villagers and houses. Some startup issues that you have to learn your way around, but very promising. I bought this game because i want to support this type of game. I'll even buy it to my friends if that will help because i see the great potential it has. The first major update will be now the 14th so that will show if the developers are able to deliver content and feature updates according to their ""release ""plan"""". Hope they will keep up the good work. If you love dragons and feel ok just to currently fly around as a dragon and await updates that make this a game, then i reccomend this game for you. If you are looking for a feature complete game, then don't buy games that says alpha.  :) "

								I REALLY want to like this game, on so many levels. First, it's indie and as a conservative, all entrepeneurship is highly appealing. Next, it puts you in control of a dragon. What's not to like about that??Let me tell you, this game is an ultimate disappointment. I bought it two years ago and I still can't play it. It is a huge burden on my system, a system that runs Fallout 4 at decent FPS levels. Save yourself the trouble. Spend your money somewhere else to send a message to the dev's that this is a failed project. They have squandered my money on a program that barely functions. Sad!			"

								So far I like what I'm seeing. It's obvious that this is still in it's earliest stages as it's little more than a framework for a game. Pretty much all that's available right now is basic movement and combat controls in a relatively small area. There is yet to even be a settings menu where you can tweak audio/video and map controls. But I am highly intrigued by the concept and am eager to see how the game's mechanics will e fleshed out in the future. If you purchase this in hopes of having a fulfilling play experience, you won't get thar right now. At this point, purchasing this game is an investement in what I believe will be a great game eventually.  Would give this a solid 7/10. You don't get a whole lot now, but you'll surely get something great later on. Buying this game will support the developer and shorten the time until new features are added.			"

								Once again, buy the game, if you want to support the devs, otherwise wait till the end of 2016 on how the game looks by then. Actual review So after over a year on my Watchlist i finally decided to grab it thanks to their Kickstarter Campaign. There is not so much to do currently, but i was aware of it. The Bugs of the Game are sometimes the most fun - remember when you first fought a Giant in Skyrim and enjoyed the view shortly afterwards? Fighting Cows in D:TG is quite similar - hit it and get pushed like 50 meters away. What suprises me the most however are the super easy to learn controls. As a controller ONLY Gamer i got quite quickly used to the controlls and could even grab Enemies mid-flight and then toss them at other enemies (but not cows, better not provoke them!)Really hoping this Game will become my new favourite Game to come!

								I bought this game when it first released....and in that entire time I have never been able to play the game at all. Everything they say they fix, still breaks. I have a super computer and this junk dosen't last but 8 minutes before the game crashes. This game may be an alpha, but by god at the rate it is updating, the final product will be done by 2234 I swear.  This alpha sucks HARD. I have never been more dissapointed in an alpha game in my entire life			"

Early Access Review
								I got this game on a whim and boy do I regret that decision. First of all, the price is ridiculous, 18 dollars for a game that features floaty flying mechanics and low resolutions maps? IN ALPHA? It is an embarrassment on my part for paying for this game. The animations are goofy, the dragons themselves have so few polygons they look like something out of a PS1 game and they have the low resolution textures to match too. One of the features of the game is ""destructible environments"" where the destruction is limited to burning down some stuff like houses and trees to a crisp... in exactly the same way every single time. The fire graphics... oh my god... seriously, it's on the same level as Quake (the original one). ""Towns"" are basically agglomerations of houses sitting on the grass on some prairie or field. They don't look lived in by real people (as humans in these towns are more akin to ants than humans), they don't look like they function as towns and once you've done burning down every single building to the same texture of burnt wood there is no sense of achievement or satisfaction. Nothing you do in this game makes any difference, you might as well just do nothing at all.The only thing that seems like it might be a good idea is the concept of flight as you get to flap your own wings at your choice, this means you can control flight much better than other games where there is no difference piloting a flying animal and a jet plane. However the execution of this concept is underwhelming, it doesn't help that the flying animations are just goofy looking and mechanical.All in all, a very bad game and the developer excusing it calling out early access and alpha as some sort of excuse for the very poor quality this game has is an indication that this project will never see completion. The mechanics of the game are floaty and unappealing, the graphics are horrible, the textures are low resolution and just ugly, the effects for fire are amazingly bad (and this is a game where you'll be using fire as your main weapon mind you) and I say amazingly because there are free games out there that have better effects for fire. I don't believe this game will ever see completion and I do believe the developer is getting more money than he/she deserves by careful editing of his game's trailer.If you pay 18 dollars for this game you're either a dumbass like I am or you're using your parent's credit card and you have no sense for value of money. There are 99 cent games for smartphones that have good graphics, solid gameplay and some even have campaigns with storylines. This game has none of those features. This game is the perfect example of how payed early access can backfire and why these kinds of games should not be allowed to exist by the people over at Steam.			"

Early Access Review
								When you purchase an Early Access game you are making a choice. A conscious choice to support and help fund the project, regardless of the potentially difficult road ahead. Early Access games are, obviously, games that are still in development. And every game that you happen to support will be in varying degrees of said development. It's inevitable that you may stumble upon something that is in it's fairly early stages. Others have brought up the length of time the game has stayed in development. I can assure you there are games that have had more funding which have been in Early Access for longer than D:TG. Most independent dev groups are small. They do not have the funding or the man power to pump out content as much as we may be used to with other titles. I've owned the game for some time. The progress has been sparse, but it's beginning to pick up speed. The team has been able to acquire better funding and they are beginning to push for content that we would like to see. It's likely that in the near future their team will grow and they will be able to produce better quality content at a much faster pace. Currently, I have to agree with some of the negative reviews. There's a lot of placeholder material, the control scheme is whack (very uncomfortable, but I believe they are aware of this), and there's not a lot to do. You run around, eat a few deer, and set some villages on fire. It's.. not entertaining. Controlling the dragon with the mouse is just strange. I really wish there was a better way to manage one's camera and flight mechanics.Yet regardless of my distaste I have high hopes for the future.The dev team seems passionate about this project. There's not many games out there like D:TG. It's kind of one of those titles we always wished for. But to make that happen we have to help support it. Constructive feedback is the most beneficial to all. Not some cheap jab at an obvious problem without offering any form of solution or critique. If we sit here and ♥♥♥♥♥ endlessly we're going to do nothing but doom the title ourselves, and then try to pass it off as the dev team's fault. It's a two way street with the commitment made with early access.They plan a lot for this game. I'm excited for the future.			"

Early Access Review
								**UPDATE**I have played this again recently and it's doing a bit better than before. Although I fought a bear and it just walked underground and I couldn't fly for a few minutes it's alright. The customization menu is very weak, I can't select any other dragons aside from green (says my dragon is green no matter what i chose), can't select any appearance modifiers like horns or anything, still can't select any traits. However, despite these issues, I can still color my dragon so it's alright. The gameplay is a bit od now I find myself constantly falling in flight after the recent flight update. Gravity was added and the flight modified to make it less ""floaty"" honestly I'd rather it be floaty than how it is now. Flying has never before been such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mid-flight trying to hang a right will just turn you in place, left doing the same. Constantly falling so you have to keep tapping space at a moderate pace to stay in the air. I tried the fireball skill and it was very offput. You'd think a dragon could hit it's mark with thew force it take to fire one of those but no. A bear is about 30 feet away? not gonna hit. Too much of a ""wind"" effect. All in all, I'd tell you to wait longer for this game.**OLD**Overall nice concept, if a bit buggy. Lags a lot on my own computer, and I get an error for killing humans with flame breath among other things, and that craches my game. I would not recommend this because it still needs a LOT of work done and seems like it was sloppily made in an hour of two. I look forward to improvement but cannot encourage sales by the product thus far. I ended up buying two copies myself, one for a friend and the other for myself but it turned out to be a waste of my money and time.			"

There are those who say that it is not a good time to buy or the games current state is not worth buying but what they don't think about is the developers use the money they get from sales to reinvest back into the game.

That said the flight is enjoyable when the screen isn't freezing up, and I do like the idea.Please understand I'm recommending this game because I like the idea, not because it is really any good right now.

Early Access Review
								its definetly a really good game; theirs some problems and some cool things to it too. like one time, i was doing my quest,which was to kill 5 rabbits, 5 wolves, and 5 deer, but then it locked up- and didnt save my pogress at all. then the game  locked up, and i had to restart my whole computer- not to mension all the other times it completely lockes up. and the developer took away some of the things that made me get the game like gliding and hovering- which were the best in my opinion. so i prefer the really good stage where the exit/quit option dosn't work but i can glide and hover and try to kill huge tree monsters over its current stage. dont get me wrong, its a great game, definetly propeling; it just does not have some of the real game that i liked- staked on top of that, you sort of drift while your flying, so turning up might make you land, or it lockes up on me- but its really good- in myopinion. i can see where their going with this. and i understand its in early developement, and i suport that. its definetly a good game- and as i said, i know where this is going. and i hope they develope it further, because i honestly want gliding again. its really fun. so, i can reccomend this game, vary happily. i dont even care what other people say. its a good game. not the best, but a good game.

Early Access Review
								After getting my early access key, I jumped straight on the computer and played the game for a bit. It's a good start, but here are the first things I feel like are missing from playing the game for the first time:- Directional controls are a bit funky. When I try to walk backwards, that's what I expect. Not the weird twirl that my dragon does, facing me away from what I'm fighting.- Not sure who is losing health, me or the wolf. Perhaps putting the health numbers of the player in a different color?- There's no good sense of aiming. A crosshair or something similar would be extremely helpful.- Looking around is clumsy. When the mouse is in the center of the screen, the camera is not. This is a huge problem and could also help with the aiming issue.- Quest markers were really all over the place. It told me to go kill a deer and the marker was floating 100 feet over the ocean.- Lag. Obvious thing to fix.- Upgrading stats wasn't working. I could only update the passive skills at the bottom. - Movement speed is terrible. I know that you eventually level up speed, but the starting walking speed is absolutely horrendous, there's almost no point to walking, except that flying is the same. I feel like it takes a long time just to fly over to the next wolf that I should be walking towards.After a quick play, these are the issues that I noticed immediately. I'm sure that there's a lot to get done, but this game has a ton of potential. With work and passion, this could be a fantastic game. Good luck, developers!			"

OK, now thats out the way lets say hoe great the idea is to me. As a kid that has always liked the lore of dragons and just about anything that had to do with dragons (even if it dosent directly relate to them I.E. the Renaissance Festival) so the idea of a dragon sim even to me as a 20 year old kid is still awsome as hell just from the idea id say where do i sign to make this happen. So im expecting great things but hell even if its not that great, but i know it will be, i'm still glad this idea is out there finally i thought i was gonna have to make it and im not that great at makeing games i still have a long way to go.So thanks just for the idea i'm looking foeward to the finished game.

								My experience from my playthrough is pretty much to be expected. A very young game that has a long way to go. Graphics are looking good,  but gameplay, controls and mechanics have yet to catch up. No storyline or dialogue in place as yet. Dragon customisation is definitely in it's infancy, There is no doubt that once the developers (Whom I am very grateful towards for starting a project like this) get the time they need they'll fix all of these problems, which are nothing more than the hallmark of an unfinished game. I can see a finished product in my mind based on what they've hinted at and it's a game I want to play. Is it currently worth the money? not going by the game alone, but support the developers, and help them out. You won't regret it when they're finished.			"

								Okay: Here's the deal. This game has a lot that [i ]could [/i] happen, but not a lot that is. If honest work were to go into this game, it would become very good, but there is no effort. If you really want to know how bad it is at the current level, let me put it this way:I am in 10th grade and am learning c++ in computer science. I truly believe that if my entire class worked together with a little help from our teacher, we could recreate this game within under three month, working only 45 minutes on weekdays. I also believe we could upgrade that when we finish it with a bit of work and make this ""game"" into what people want it to be. I really,  really  don't want to shame this game.  I am a dragonkin, and I feel need to have something, anything at all, in which I can be a dragon or even a regular animal of some sort. This game was really dissapointing when it says that it gives me what I need, and then fails on it miserably.  I really like this game's idea, and with what I've played it even could be good: bad/outdated graphics don't bother me nearly as much as they do some people. Even the broken physics and controls are sort of okay for me. The main qualm I have with it is the lack of content. There is absolutely no point. I've heard ""rumors""  certainly not in the update notes  that you can get a cave, but I have found no such area, and the world itself seems so empty. There is no variety in the type of people, and there isn't even a leveling system: all dragons are the same.If you want to play it, which you're actually wrong in thinking, I would suggest you find somewhere to pirate it because it's not worth giving the ""developers"" more money to do nothing. Unfortunately for you, I'm pretty sure the game is too crappy to even be pirated by anyone, because there certainly aren't any good wikis that I could find.I myself will continue to look through the update notes every once in a while with the hope that something new will be added. I doubt anything will, but I will remain as optimistic as I can...			"

								This game is in very early stages so it wouldn´t be fair rating it anyhow. All I can say is that I love the idea and it has a lot of potential. You can be a freaking dragon you create and do all that dragon stuff. I think that speaks for itself. Can´t wait for the future updates.			"

								This has, singly, the worst flight control system I have ever encountered. Couple that with broken controls and where 'exit game' means 'edit dragon', as if they mean to encase you in gameplay. As an avid gamer, there are not many games that can ACTUALLY make me seasick, but...five minutes of this will have you begging for a railing.			"

								i'm gonna get straight to it! as of RIGHT NOW, the game is to broken to be any fun. it's BARELY playable, for ME at least! i LOVE(!!!!) the idea of a FULL REAL game, where you play as a dragon, but right now, almost EVERYTHING is hard to do, due to bugs and bad animation or coding or what it is. walking UP is weird, walking DOWN is weird, FLYING is hard, BRAKING is hard, EATING is just animal/human, eat, red cubes. OR! animal/human, burn, DARK red cubes. flying into a mountain, might teleport/glitch you to the UNDERSIDE of the world, where your stamina is CONSTANTLY being drained, and because of that, AND since your so young, you don't have enough stamina to fly back UP again, which makes you fall forever, and have to start over. the GRAPHICS aren't very good/crappy, except for the dragon. i don't FEEL like a FEROCIOUS MAN EATING dragon! i feel like a baby or mentally challenged dragon, who the world decides to f""¤ with, from time to time. it's gonna take A LOT of work. like... AN ENTIRE GAME, to make it good. but i will wait, and see if it gets better, as the world NEEDS a GOOD dragon game! so... should you buy it? that depends: do you want a game you can PLAY? if YES, then NO! if you simply want to help out the creators and HOPE that they make a playable game, then sure. go ahead. but as of NOW, it's not even worth a pence/cent/øre/small amount of your currency.

								This game has a good concept. But the mouse controls are too hard to handle, as it is way to easy to spin around. The quest arrow (the ones that tell you where to go, can't think of it right now) is easy to see but it is hard to small things with it, For enemies you can only hit it once before the attacks don't effect it anymore, and the enemies cant ht you so its in an entire state of limbo. I wouldn't recommend it YET. I would wait until its controls are more streamlined and the quest waypoint (remembered it) arrow makes it easierv to see the smaller enemies, and the lurning crve is harder because it is TOO easy.

								So far, the worst Early Acces i've bought, i think.Slow updates, with little change.

And the last patch 0.80 made the game unplayable for some users, included myself (game can't launch).I hope i will want to change my review later, to a positive one. Later. Not today.			"

								Update: editing my reveiw to reflect the update. its still terrible.it took them 4 months to figure out how to save a damn charactor. 4. months. the things they added arn't even working. whats the point of giving us stats the level up if half of them don't even do♥♥♥♥♥♥ no matter what map you pick it always sends you to the same, mostly empty map. right below your nest theres 1 or 2 cows, a few deer, and off to the left theres some archers. thats about it. nothing else alive on the map anywhere.oh the archers, don't even get me ♥♥♥♥ing started on them. the devs decided that rather then have the archers themselves fire at you, they would have the ground around the archers fire at you, even after they're long dead and eaten. takign damage in this game is atrocious. sometimes you'll get hurt, sometimes you'll get hurt 30 seconds after the fight has ended. even then, your health is a percentage, not a number. you can't tell if leveling your health even does anything or how much you have to start. still no lairs besides the one you start in. i found a city once. it disapeared when i got within 5 feet of it.don't make me comment on the skybox its the worst i've seen yet.

Early Access Review
								This game, in its current state is an emotional roller coaster. The promise and prospect are so tantalizing (and need to be) You can ALMOST get over the game crashing every 5 minutes. The game in its current state (v8.4) finally has some content to keep you playing, even if it is a redundant ""kill x of these quest system"", which most often than not completing a quests will crash the game. Currently the only rewards for eating and questing are the abilities to grow in size (completley aesthetic?) and the ability to move faster. Starting out you get to customize you dragons body color and wing color (with more customization aspects promised in the future). The map is quite glitchy, floating rocks and landmarks. Some physics get a little weird, you might bump into a tree then go flying in a random direction at light speed.  I am definatly interested in seeing what this game becomes in the future, although updates are few and far between. This might be one that I'd wait a year before investing in. On the flip side The concept behind the game, I have yet to see anywhere else making this a unique gaming expirence and definatly recommend to the Dragon enthusiast.			"

								I appreciate that this is an Alpha game and it has the potential to be better. The developer needs to fix the memory leak or what ever is causing the massive graphical lag on lower systems or when you use flame on higher end systems. I tried it on two different level PC's and had the same graphicl lag problem, the first one is 4 years old with at GTX460 and the second is 2 years old with i7 processor, 12GB ram and GTX670, both had the same graphic's lag problem after a few minutes of play. Higher dragon position in the screen would be better too.Also the controller option and sound are not working yet.			"

								This review matches the User: GrageonI have noticed a thoughtfulness in the way dragons fly. I tend to play as a conservative clicker and the way the dragon handles itself per click rather than click and hold is astounding.I had trouble with the bloodlines and skills, check marks were not affecting the numbering system on either side. Summary page is blank, but that can be expected with barebones.Major view:Zoom control on the dragon in both the creation and world menu would be superb. Lowering the camera angle for ground situations would help as well so we can get our bearing with what our dragon is doing in front and not what is happening 200 miles away.Minor views:Birds in the opening of the game flock properly, after flying for 2 minutes they tend to just resync to their spawning loop position and just hover there in a cluster.Landing of the dragon is a bit awkward, Dragon seems to hover like a helicopter in high elevation even if tilted forward or backward. (straight down is a bullet)Due to being barebones new, i can accept putting my gaming pc into fastest graphics mode since turning on beautiful nearly killed me after killing the humans. (refer to the other user's review)If you need any specific testings let me know, plenty of potential.-Shylo			"

Early Access Review
								Since this game was just released as a super early♥♥♥♥♥alpha recently, it's not completed (obviously). There's not much to do and not much to see. It's a starting point and the devs are pretty keen on working on stuff (and did some pretty immediate bug fixes so that's a pretty good sign). Here's the preliminary barebones review, to be updated as the game does.UPDATED - NOVEMBER 12TH, 2014Notes: It's really hard to actually split some of these things into pros and cons at this stage of development because everything, depending on what you value or how 'done' it is could go in either category. Until the game is further along, I'll keep the various points in a numbered list here, irrespective of pro or con.ONTO THE THINGS--1. Lots of potential. You're in a sandbox world as a dragon and theoretically, you get to help shape the landscape (metaphorically). Hopefully before too long we'll be able to interact with humans, have enemies, etc. At the moment, as of the latest hotfix, there is a lot more life to the map. Humans (some that attack you with spears), cows, deer, trolls, move houses, lots of trees-- It's not much yet, but it's getting there, especially compared to what it was on release day.2. Graphics aren't half bad though not spectacular. A little dated at the moment. They'll probably get better and could use some optimization work (but so could the whole system and that typically comes with time). There are still some problems with screen resolutions and rendering, but killing something no longer causes the Peasant of Doom glitch (I.E. killing a peasant would cause them to erupt with red blood gibs that formed an FPS-murdering column to the point where you ought to restart your game and think about what you how murdering peasants is apparently bad). Also the status bars and some of the buttons (like the map selection button that looks a bit like a loading screen) could use some polish.3. Dragons are customizable and can age. While that's not fully implemented yet, it's on the way, bro. There is some current customization and stats (but they don't seem to have much effect at the moment). At the moment, customization is limited to changing colors, but entire different species of dragon and adaptations are planned.4. Linux and Mac versions.They were released pretty quickly along with the recent hotfix. There seems to have been some issues with getting the Linux version to play straight from Steam for some users, but the devs posted a workaround for it in the meantime while they fix up their Linux upload.5. Very active and respectable developers.They've been very active in the forums, very polite in how they handle criticism and feedback of all sorts, and have shown zero leaning towards any sort of censorship. They're chill with anyone wanting to review or add suggestions or doing letsplays. They're also working on cataloguing known bugs to quash as they can while working on implementing new mechanics. So far, they've been very on top of things and have been amicable. They are some of the best behaved Early Access developers I've ever run across.6. Unity engine. Not really a con unto itself so much as Unity can be a buggy pain but it can also do some cool stuff. There are people that really don't like the Unity engine. That's entirely fair. However, it can be done well. In the meantime, it's going to be its own pain in the♥♥♥♥♥while the devs work to tame it. It also just doesn't seem to like some computers which can be a real off-putter to some gamers.7. Nothing much at the moment to do. You can fly around (the mechanics of that were improved with the recent hotfix, but it can still be a bit wonky-- I'm bad at it and faceplant into the ground a lot). You can light things on fire, especially now that there's a lot more to burn: several villages from small to large (though some are unpopulated), a small amount of people (women with spears and screaming men), trees, and apparently trolls. You can also eat the gibs that drop to help you grow. Unfortunately, there's nothing more than that yet. That and the growth mechanic isn't exactly implemented yet either and it needs a lot of tweaking.8. The tutorial is virtually non-existent.A tutorial itself hasn't really been implemented but some helpful hints when you start a world are shown on the screen. Unfortunately, due to earlier mentioned resolution problems. There is a list of current controls pinned in the Steam forums, but that's another temporary workaround until things can be more solidly implemented.9. No save/load feature.When you start a world, you always start fresh. You cannot save and you cannot load. This is only temporary, but at the moment, there isn't much you'd want to save anyway. Your dragon's stats at the moment are carried over through the playthroughs anyway. Just every time you start the game, you basically refresh the map so you can burn the same villages over and over again.10. Pricy, somewhat. For the level of early access that it is, it's a bit high, but they made no pretense about how much it would be when they posted their pricing model in the forums here on Steam. However, in the long run and for being a part of the development process, that's not so bad. It just depends on what's worth it more to you, the customer, to pay now to be part of the development process or to pay later (at a possibly higher cost) when the game is more complete or entirely complete. The developers have stated that they are encouraging people who aren't sure or who have been burned by Early Access debaucles before to please wait to purchase until their trust can be earned.			"

								I'm going to post my little opinion about all this, cause I'm seeing so many jabs toward this game. My opinion on this game is that while it is kind of splayed out and awkward on many levels(and my computer can't really run it, but that's my graphics card, not really the game), I do like it. I see that this game can go somewhere. Yes, it's been a month and no update has happened, but think about it this way from the devs perspectives. Someone had to probably pay bills, someone probably got hurt, or someone became ill. These could lead to a major slow down in production. And hey, maybe they didn't wanna say anything about any of those possibilities because they didn't want us to worry about the games production, or maybe they're just waiting for the right moment to tell us something special. Who really knows? My thing is, I see so much negativity on these reviews from people who bought this game aside from the people who actually have valid points.The way I see it is, you bought this game because you were eager for something, right? This page on the right side clearly states in their description that this is an early access and is NOT complete. To dumb it down, yes it is unpolished. Yes, there are many bugs. Yes, you cannot do a lot other than fly around and kill stuff and take damage from your own fire. Expect it. Because they are still working out kinks, just very slowly. And hey, sometimes slow and steady wins the race right? Yes, that was cheesy, but it's true in some cases.I'm not trying to completely defend the developers on their slow progression(and yeah, it does sound like I am, doesn't it?), I'm just trying to say don't have completely high expectations. Because if you do, you're going to be stomping away all huffy puffy wondering where your $18 refund is. And I've seen a lot of reviews that start with ""I know it's early alpha, buuut..."" No buts. You bought the game. Therefore you ""signed up"" for it's underdevelopment and are willing to patiently see it through. No crying or whineing about how dumb and crummy it looks right now. If it's early alpha, expect some stuff to not look right. It just means the developers have to get to that at some point. They're not octopi.That's all I really have to say on the matter.LATER EDIT: As a message to those who are curious about this game and aren't interested in waiting month after month for an update for a game that does still have many glitches and settings that hardly make much of anything better, it's recommended that you guys wait. Trust me, you won't have to scream about a refund or say you got scammed. Save your money, and just keep an eye out for updates and maybe more positive reviews for reassurance. This game has potential, but it's got a long way to go. Only jump on the bandwagon if you know what you're getting into.			"

								The game as it stands is already a fun time. I mean flying through the sky as a dragon is fun itself once they add more content the game can only go up from where its at. Its gonna be an amazing time.If you watch movies like Reign of Fire and thought to yourself ""yes"". This game is for youI enjoy coming back to this after updates. It always gets a little bit better. Keep your eyes on the prize guys. This game can be something special. 5/23/16			"

								Please keep in mind that this is an alpha review! If you're looking for a game to play for hours and hours, this is not it.There's barely anything to do at the time being, apart from flying, igniting stuff and eat the occasional mammal. No Quests, nothing to craft or to claim as loot for your lair so far.Yet, this looks great! Taking off and landing works really great and easy already, the controls are very intuitive, (although a little buggy still).The graphics look overall nice and shiny, and the engine runs stable as far as I can tell, didn't encounter a crash or major glitch so far.The camera allows for 'dragon barely visible'  to almost first person distance and can be turned 360°, you can adore your dragon from every possible angle and distance. The concept and idea is brilliant and support-worthy.Flying above the land is really fun already, the speed to map size ratio is nice and you feel like you really own the land when dashing over it.I hope they'll include mating in some form though :3 In this stage, I can only rate it  Dragon/10.If you're looking for a game that's almost finished, you'll be disappointed in this, but, if you want to support and be part of what looks awesome... join!

								Before you read this review, I ask that you know and understand that I was fully prepared to deal with any glitches, bugs, problems, or lack of content in this game, knowing that it is in early access and certain there was an idea here to be built upon. That said, I think I can firmly say that this game should not have been released into early access at this point in time as there is no central idea to build upon. Not only that, but there aren't any mechanics either. Flight is as about as smooth and simple as dancing the can-can with a pitchfork shoved firmly up your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the graphics are about as appealing as the head of medusa if the snakes on her head suffered from projectile vomit, and I have to be incredibly careful where I fly lest I fly out of the flat world, where I ended up spending more than half of my time despite being more cautious than my mother on my first day of school. The ""goblins"" and ""people"" might as well have been dots on the screen, and the quite sparsely spread excuses for structures might have fallen over if I farted in the wrong direction- I'm not quite sure what I did, they were always falling over anyways. I can say, however, that the rest of the game was a blissful journey through neverland without feeling a sense of guilt that would have made hitler feel like a goody-two shoes, simply because there was no rest of the game. Perhaps with three more years of work it won't make Tōru Iwatani feel like his Pac-Man game was ages ahead of it's time. I don't think I've ever given up on a game as quickly as I gave up on this one for fear of losing my precious time that I might have spent better playing some other game.			"

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEW 01/11/2014This is not a game yet, this is an idea, an extremely buggy idea currently in early access so don't judge the final product off this review or how the game plays at this current time.This game is in Alpha so expect the game to change considerably when it is released but right now the game is worth less than an Xbox Live indie game.The concept is amazing where you have to make your dragon and level it up online or solo choosing your own path as a dragon, the flying is amazing where using to much stamina will cause your dragon to tire and drop so you must use slow flaps to keep your dragon in the air while also picking up momentum.In conclusion this game as of right now is not worth it at all, why? Because it's not fun, it's a great idea and I think it will turn out great and that is why you should definately follow the game if you are unsure about it and see how it improves but for now stay away. I give it a fair 4/10 not because I think the game will turn out completely awful but because the game currently is awful but it's early access so obviously when the game is released it will be a considerable amount better.---YouTube Video---Coming Soon			"

								I love the concept of the game. Create a dragon, grow it with rpg elements. It's an early access game and most of the promised features are not yet in the game.What can you do right now? You can create a dragon, customizing the colour and name, and then fly around the landscape. You can also do this with multiplayer.Multiplayer has been fairly laggy so far, but I think that's more to do with people murdering humans (causes big lag) than anything else.The flying mechanics are quite fun as they are now and flying around is enjoyable.It's not a ""game"" as yet though, there's nothing much to do.Recommending it on the basis of supporting the dev.

								Okay guys, this game is in it's pre-alpha stage as of now.  This said, it's not all that bad to buy, to keep up support for it.  If anyone has seen the forums it has for the game, you can see, it has a lot of positive things that are more than likely going to be added to it.  IF YOU SO CHOSE to buy this game, take note, that right now, it does not have a lot of features you can play with.  The Humans are barely established, the other monsters are pretty rare seen, and the terrain is actually pretty low-key as of this moment.  With the cons out of the way, do keep in mind, it's still a developing game.  You can get on their forums and type away on the things you want added, and more than likely so, they will be as long as it pertains reasonably to the game in question.  Still yet, I approve of supporting this game in the hopes that the devs will do their very best to make it what it was meant to be.			"

								This game has potential.I'm not sure if it's worth its price at the moment but I have faith in the devs.Why? Mostly because I'd LOVE to see more games in which I can play as a dragon(NOT a dude riding a dragon/turning into a dragon(or a wyvern)/or controling a dragon/wyvern/something...) and as of now I have difficulties finding any.Of course the controls are unintuitive, unreliable and kinda weird(the camera!).the graphics... aren't bad... at least not too much.You can see that devs are making progress.(thouh the game is still buggy as hell).......(ALL HAIL THE DRAGON!!!)

								This game has A LOT of work to be done before it is ready. The camera is glitchy and the landscape glitches out a lot. I think that I probably came into playing this game to early in its development. I haven't given up hope on this game and still think it can improve.			"

								This game is complete garbage, I've bought this game when it was very close to its release date and still today I can't make a dragon with any stats, when I did originally make a small dragon The graphics were horrible, the game play choppy, and couldnt find anything to kill. I shot fire out on some trees and that was about as much as i felt like wasting time on.			"

I can only name four and the spyro games (I honestly lost track of the seires after year of the dragon). I can't wait to see what the developers have in store for this game. I feel that once enuff time passes and upades roll around this will be a great game to play.			"

								Ok so a lot of people are saying that this is a bad game at the moment it is not the most amazing game no, but it is still in early access and the concept of this game is incredible I mean what other game lets you ""be"" a dragon and do what you want to do... I can't name any. People are also saying that the devs are not being very active but they did just recently post on Facebook an update on some of the new graphics they are going to introduce soon so they are attempting to improve the game as much as they can for the moment. So please stop with all of these negative comments about this they are trying an I would like to see you do better.			"

								Enjoying the game it looks to be a great future game but right now its a whatever. I love the speed of the flying and the shooting flame ability i wish they would add different things to breath other than just red fire like mabey blue flames or ice breath so you can shatter it with a claw slash. Now i don't know if anyone else is having this problem but is there music in this if so i am not getting it if not so can't wait to see what the devs put in for it. Also i just love how you can kill people and animals and eat them to gain exp and not just destroying houses to gain it smart choice there.			"

								How did this ever get allowed to be on steam? The textures need work, there are more glitches than I can count, the menu system is confusing and in no way easy to navigate, the controls are mind boggling, the sound poor. Pretty much everything about this game is bad.I've played plenty of early access games before and they've worked out mostly ok, but this is just insulting. It's a really nice idea but abysmally executed and in it's current form I can't reccomend it one ioata.			"

								The developers do seem to care about this one, as I am beginning to. bugs galore right now. I landed on a mtn side, and suddenly a big troll or orc came at me, I fought and flamed like krazy and killed him, then was unable to eat, because I fell thru the world. It was great for a sec there. Seems to help a bit when angles go wanky, to hit shift to wiggle or speed out of it..sometimes it works.			"

Early Access Review
								UPDATED: 14 November 2014First off, let me say that this game is in VERY Early Access. All you can really do at this time is fly around and flame some stuff, so if you're looking for a finished game, don't get this just yet. However, this game has a lot of potential, and at this point in time, looks very promising. How it goes from here depends on where the dev takes it, though they seem to genuinely enjoy doing this, so I have high hopes for how it comes out.I'll edit this as more content is released and the game is updated.Now, there are currently a number of bugs that are with the game (to be expected from early access) including:~The Exit button does not work (EDIT: The Exit button only seems to break if you delete a dragon)~If you delete a dragon after creating it, it will no longer let you choose/create new dragons, and you are stuck with the dragon you deleted. (EDIT: Completely deleting the ""Dragon"" folder in steam => steamapps => common folder on your C: drive (or wherever Steam installs itself to) and reinstalling the game seems to fix this).~After deleting the dragons and restarting the game, the ""New World"" is shaded out, until I tried to exit the game (which failed because the button was broken) and went back to the menu, where the New World option was available again, even though forcing me to play as the dragon I deleted.~There is also a case of extreme lag, especially when flaming people. (EDIT: It has been fixed, since now it isn't and endless fountain of food, but it still lags at least my game, even though it doesn't crash the game like it used to.)~An issue with the mouse staying inside of the window when in windowed mode~The camera runs a little high, especially when you land, and seems to get stuck on whatever position it had to go to when you landed.~Resolution problems, where changing the resolution affects the menus (at least in Windowed mode, not sure about fullscreen), making it difficult to navigate them because they do not size down with the res, or they compress to fit into the window without changing size, thus overlapping each other.~RPG elements are minimal, killing humans and ""eating"" the blocks they dropped increases your experience bar, even though I haven't found enough humans to get to the level up screen just yet.~Customization is minimal down to changing your dragon's color.~Perhaps moving the dragon closer to the screen when customizing so you can see them better, as well as enabling a sort of free look so as to be able to clearly see every part of the dragon you're customizing~A lot of very bad lag, don't know if it's my computer. But the moment the game starts to the monent it closes there is lag.Glitches aside, and despite its current minimal state as I'm playing it (14 Novemeber 2014 --- 7 Days after release) this game looks very promising and genuinely fun. I'm looking forward to where the devs take this.			"

								Bought this game and to be honest you get get exactly as it says on the tin,A dragon: Well thought out and most of the basic features are there, you can fly, breath fire, burn down tree's and house etc you get the idea.Landscape: Bleak and empty and without proper borders at the moment but thats to be expected at such an early stage.there are some birds and I had hoped that they would be edible but no such luck yet but as i said this is very early stages.Gameplay: Has a lot of potential not much else to say on this.Should you buy it?If you like playtesting games and supporting developers, they go ahead but don't expect much bang for your buck just yet.If you want  full swinging areal combat and fully fledged dragon with many people and places to rule over then no. Wait for a later alpha release or the actual release.As for the recommendation the developers have not put the game on a pedestal and it is what they say it is.Just for the potential of this game im going to say yes, follow it and buy it later or buy it and playtest it now.

								In my previous review, I stated that the game flat out didn't work.I take that back, it does, I was just being an idiot and not understanding that you need to name your dragon in the upper left corner.As for the actual review, all you can do is fly and burn down maybe 3 or 4 buildings.Honestly, this is ridiculous for even EA, I should at least have SOME sort of game. The ""Current In-Game Features"" lists villagers, basic combat, and other things, but either I'm not seaching hard enough or these features don't exist in the current game. Overall, in this state, from a company who has no other games published save this early alpha, I'd reccomend caution. You never know whether or not this could turn into an amazing game, or if the developer could just pump out mediocracy and walk off with bags of cash.Therefore, in this current state, I have to say that it would likely be wise to save your money instead of getting this, at least for the time being.

								There is literally only 10 minutes of gameplay right now. That is to be expect however, of a pre-alpha game. Many people who bought it were expecting a AAA game full of features and whatnot. Of course what can you expect on steam, people never read the game decription or watch a video. All in all, it's pre-alpha do not expect a finished game, or even a finished menu. If the developers keep good on their word, it might just be a masterpiece in the future.			"

My Review on this game.Probably a sh*tty start, but it doesn't matter. I'm just giving out my opinion.Sure, this game is in Early Access; it also contains some typo's as well. But I'm pretty sure it'll get better over time. The game is mostly laggy apparently~ regardless of the settings and there's few to little no enemies. The fact of most of them usually falling through the ground when killed is kind of annoying~ but that's just me. Because this is a game actually made for you to play as a dragon. When you think about it... there's not many games that'll allow you to play as an actual dragon by itself. Usually, most games contains dragons. However, it either involves you killing it or taming it. (If you can, that is.) Otherwise... killing it seems, well~ mostly the case in most games apparently. Take this game as if it was Goat Simulator in early development. Sure, not quite the best example. But hey... Goat Simulator is Goat Simulator. Dragon: The Game is just Dragon: The Game.Goat Simulator - Like all games, it takes quite a lot of time to create, and for the developers to make the game... they created the game for other people to enjoy. To at least pass the time with and have fun. Such as this game~ Dragon: The Game in early development. It sure has a lot of work to do. Sure, it may be taking a while for each update~ but there's always a reason behind it. At least give credit to these people~ they at least made the game and updated it time to time, and to update it time to time is better than never.Updated Review @ 2:15 AMI realized most people are hating over this game tbh, and hating those who support it; or would like to support it. I kinda find it a bit sad.I'm not saying I don't respect their opinions for hating the game or something like that. But... really, to hate people over the fact of writing a review for this game or supporting it. Come on now; no wonder why I lost faith in humanity. Aye, many people tend to not really see the bright/positive side; to appreciate the littlest things in a game.Look, I know there are you people who are disappointed in the fact you got this game. But seriously, you all should've looked a bit better to see it's in Early Access.It has bugs, ALL games do.Don't you know how hard the dev's have to work just to make the game enjoyable with good graphics? With a good engine and other stuff? Jesus guys/gals, that's sad you have to hate this game over the crappiest of excuses.There are those of us who are loyal, and whom who will support throughout the test of time; there may not be alot of us. But hey, we got a taste and we can say we supported it at least unlike those who hadn't seen the positive side. To know how long the developers have to work, how hard they have to work... taking days, weeks, months, or even YEARS to improve the game. What do you people who complain do?Hate, complain, whine about it.That's it. Just that.To those who probably don't like the game at all yet still support it... and doesn't hate on other people and respect their opinions on the game...I'd like to sincerely thank you.~ It's a mature move tbh.I also would like to thank those who did read my Review here, I just wanted to point a few things out. Hopefully some people can see my side and see how entirely tiring it is for people to hate this game over bugs and stuff when they don't have to work 24/7, having to do days... weeks, months or years of work like the Developers have to do.Most of you don't know how hard it is.Updated Review @ 4:54 PM.The game seems much less laggier now from what I've seen, still a few bugs...~But improvement is all that counts. x3			"

Early Access Review
								This game is ♥♥♥♥ing ruined and the devs gave up. Please ignore this review. They ""restarted"" the game and they ♥♥♥♥ing ruined it by breaking literally everything. This game's going nowhere.Edit on October 21 2015 - Updates have been progressively slower and have come to a complete halt. I feel like the developer has given up. Everything is buggy and the menu is still broken. I do not recommend buying the game anymore.I've been following DRAGON for a while, and I was very excited when it was released yesterday. Even in its pre-alpha state right now, I can see that it still has a lot of potential. At the moment I'm writing this review, there isn't too much you can do in the game - You can only customize and name your Dragon fly around, burn a few things, even fly under the map.But, in the future, there will be many more features, which I am very much looking forward to! Such as, more customization, bigger worlds, (I believe I read--) quests (--somewhere), more creatures, castles, forts, caves, seas - you name it! Dragon might just be the one to have it!As you can see, I've already spent a good amount of time playing DRAGON. This is because I've been observing the game heavilly, and experimenting with the limited things I can currently do. It fascinates me. I'm very excited for the upcoming updates so I'll have more to experiment with!SUMMARY:Is it good?Yes.Is it worth buying right now?If you are interested in playing it in the future, yes. It will get more expensive as time goes on. "

								Read the whole review please.The state of this game is so far behind any sort of ""releasable"" video game that it's laughable Literally all you do is fly around (clunkily) on a very small piece of land, burn a couple houses, kill a couple ai humans, walk, basic attack, and wait for the game to crash. Only the color is changeable, all other stats do nothing during dragon creation. This is a demo of technology, not a game.All of that said, this software is a bargain at twice the price. For all of its faults, this is in the top 20 of best games of all time as far as I'm concerned. First of all the dragons are sextipedal. *drops mic*As long as you know that there isn't much to do, but you love dragons, I highly recommend buying this game immediately to pay the folks who've made this amazing concept for us. Let's give them our support! This is a game worth making!			"

								Yes as most other people said, early alpha and not much you can do in the game, BUT that doesn't mean it's not fun. Especially when you take a look at what they'll add with the next update, which is Nov 14th :)All in all, for now it's still far from being complete game, and if you don't want to get it now, wait for some time. For certain people, like me :), who are crazy about dragons I do recommend this. Aside from helping devs to make this game more awesome, you'll be able to get the basic of the game.Well enough rambling form me, it's fun stuff, so if you are into Dragons, flying, burning and stuff, do get it, oh and also,when ya burn the carriage, it doesn't disappear :) just keeps on the fancy glow, which is pretty fun to see :)cheers			"

Early Access Review
								Just because it is early access does not mean it has the excuse to be this bad, I paid 20 dollers for a game and what I got was a barely functional game with no clear goals or even an attempt at a story. I have played some truely great early access games on steam but trust me this game is not among themlet us look at the detailspros- play as dragon (skyrim has better graphics and playable dragons mods with better controls)- wide open world (not done very well and just abruptly ends into a void)- medicore fire effects ( takes up to 20 secobnds of blasting a house to even see it start burning)cons- horrid controls- enemies that appear out of mid air- super lag (and before people say its just my PC I can run Skyrim on ultra so its not the PC trust me)- twenty dollers for a freaking early access crud fest- menu controls barely work- dragon customization screen is has a very strange set up and atrocious controlsWhile this project has the potential to become truely great, at the stage it is now it should be a free to play or at least under five dollars. When minecraft's graphics look more inspired and the controls are worse then somthing out of an old atari system then you know you have a problem. "

								Tried it and It looks amazing even in its pre-alpha state. I will say that it's glitch ridden but, that's a given. Alsoc if you accidently delete a dragon, you can no longer open the dragon menu OR exit the game..so yeah that must be patched when needed. There is a lot that needs fixing and tweaking but by the patch date (Nov. 14th) the kinks should be taken care of. I wanted to try something new to wander away from the Gmods and the Amnesias and looked through the MMO lists and just notised this. This title is more for people who participate in beta testing and my only experience was burning a dude and watch him rocket into space leaving a pillar of lag-enducing block-blood. Afterwards I wanted to tinker with the Creation system (Which needs to be able to zoom on your dragon btw) and i accidently deleted my dragon causing a bug that prevented me from opening the creation menus or even exit the game. As of now, what needs to be fixed is the operation bugs.			"

								This game is a very early access game, and you should not play it unless you want to continuously support it in development. Now that we got that out of the way, this game is AMAZING so far. There's not much to do in it, but you can still have fun. So far you can customize your dragon, fly around, and burn some stuff. The map is not completed, so you  will find the end of the map, and can fly under the map, so you can mess around with that. You should definetlley buy this game now if you want to play it in the future, because with all of this potential, the price will probably go up. So, if your not interested with this early access version, still buy it so you can play in the future.			"

								This game is as it says in early beta, but i know my friend would have killed and i mean literally killed for this game if he were alive today. Any dragon lover should support this game if only to show the development team your support so they make the best game possible. I showed my roommate the stat page and creation choices and he left the room rubbing his hands together muttering to himself ""I must tell Will about this game."" My one suggestion is that in character creation i seemed to be stuck veiwing my dragon from behind and thus found the fact i could customize my dragons head rather meaningless or at least i didnt have any visual representaion of my choices i just had to hope for the best.  if you ever add a feature to spin your dragon and see a 3d representation i will be wholely satisfied but for now i will be glad with more things to slay and destroy.

Early Access Review
								So far, for an early access game--it's reallyI've always wanted to have a game where I get to be the dragon, and I hope it just gets better and better.This game is fairly simple, and some might think the price is TOO HIGH for the simplicity of it so far, but I find it very entertaining, and the online portion is great when there are people.______UPDATE______I bought this game 2 days ago, and so far have enjoyed playing it, even if it fairly simple SO FAR.BUGS: -For me and others, when in online mode, where you spawn, there are a few trees, and some really small people, if you burn them, it causes the game to get INCREDIBLY laggy, and you then have to exit the game and restart it to fix the problem.-When flying, making a hard right will cause your dragon to become permenantly tilted to the right, screen/camera too, and it makes it increbibly hard to fly and walk, and look around, this also must be fixed by restarting the game. DISLIKES: -Me and others I have talked to on the online servers have expressed their frustration that while typing, when using the spacebar key it causes your dragon to jump. It wouldn't be much of a problem if when typing and pressing space TWICE before your dragon lands the first time it causes it to jump off and fly off of whatever you may be perched on. If you're flying, then it's not a big deal.-There is NO SOUND. You're probably working on that, I'm just saying I love dragons and especially their sounds, so whenever you could get that inw ould be great.LIKES:-For an early access game, I really appreciate what you have so far, it's fantastic.-Love the online mode, not many people, but it's fun to fly aroudn with them when there are a few. It's very simple to set up a room and host it. -Dragon's flying animation is very nice.IDEAS:-Maybe center the dragon more in the middle of the camera?-Perhaps make the dragon larger? I think that would make it a bit nicer, especially since you get to choose different ages, so the sizes depends on the age, but I've done both YOUNG DRAKE and ANCIENT, and there is no size difference that I can see.

								Yes this game is truly in Alpha. There are tons of bugs, and crashes. However the game has a great premise and shows alot of promise. The devs post when the next update is due. The reason why i think it deserves my 15 bucks (i got it on sale) is because of the general idea. There was a game called Eye of the Dragon a long while ago that played on the same idea but lacked execution and decent gameplay. I hope this one can make up where the other failed. I really like how you start as a hatchling and can work your way to to an Ancient dragon. The flight mechanics need abit of work as they feel clunky and non responsive sometimes like a broken helicopter. However i cant wait to see what in store for this games future.			"

								I know this game is quite unfinished, and Early Access Game state.It's kinda disappointment, there's alot of glitches in there. Camera and your dragon sometimes twist in random angle. And somehow you finds some pointless of this game. etc. But I don't care very much.Personally, I like the dragons. This game looks like an inspiration of ""I of The Dragon"" development since 2004, I like that game also. That you flys over the landscape, and killing the monsters. However, I'm still looking forward for this game until to final game. I might be recommend for this game...but It's still in under development...I suggest you to buy this game on final release! and let see how worth it... "

Broken controls/flying mechanics, irrating camera angles, bad graphics,game breaking glitches and overpriced for something this early in development to waste your money on this product. I agree this game has potential and can be fun at times but needs alot more work before actually buying it. my personal score for this game is 2/10 until the developer improves it.			"

								just one thing:The idea is there, but the game is not.When te game started it was all glitchy and lagged a lot, really a lot, I tought about changing the settings to the lowest, just to move fast. Nothing had changed.I tried to fly around but i couldn't turn at the right time and it was so laggy that i couldn't undestand where i was turning.The only enemies I found were: two women, a bear, a moose or something like that (can't remember the name right now)...well, the ladies died like instantly and they just ran towards me and stopped right in front of me ready to be barbecued, but the other two...they we're like satan was disguised as an animal, they just didn't move, well the moose thing did jump but never moved away, it just jumped around. I tried to kill them with fire, no damage or they didn't feel the power of my flame or something...tried to claw them, and a strange red aura went around them and disappeard living the animal still alive waiting for more pain...I have made some screenshots, so maybe check them out.As a final conclusion I'd say: Buy the game, try to play it, get distressed after 20 min, hope for improvement cause the idea is there, even if the graphics aren't that good, the idea is there (grow your dragon, get stronger, explore, save mankind or destroy it) but the ideas aren't quite in the game yet.So buy it and wait for the release, hoping that they won't destroy everything.Bye,Vetens			"

								I don't recommend this game due to how crappy the controls are. It's hard to play and you can't switch your camera view or even move it. But to be fair this game is in beta testing and I think it would be a great idea for a game as along as they develop it more.			"

								Not a bad game. Lots of bugs of course, as is with every game in progress. I've noticed that, when landed and turning the camera, the dragon spins as if on a plate, rather than on the actual ground. So one direction you're looking into the sky, another direction you're head-first in the ground. Another thing is the flight mechanics feel a bit off. I will be straight yet the dragon will be turning as if i weren't. And a tip I'd add is to possibly make it so that the dragon's direction is governed by the mouse? Like it will look where the mouse is 'pointing'. It's difficult to get around without being able to direct yourself.			"

								This game is still in VERY early alpha at the time of writing, and for now it is basically a slightly laggy dragon exploration/flight sandbox.       However, both the concept and the current in-game foundation has huge potential for expansion, and while notices and communication from the developers are somewhat slow, the updates are consistently substantial. What exists of the land and textures looks really good, and there is already a nice variety of animated mob types with in the beta (humans, animals and different monsters). The new dragon model looks and moves fantastic- I could absolutely imagine this creature creeping down a rocky crag or lurking in a fen.  Given that we already have the framework for both single- and multi-player games, a bit of diversification of dragon types/abilities, and a fair bit of world-building on the dev's site, this game could truly be built up into something awesome.

								The very first thing I noticed was that this game lacks optimisation. I have a decent build that can run most games on mid-to-high settings, but this game stutters even on the fastest setting and with the lowest resolution. It's extremely difficult to play when the game is stuttering, so in that regard I'm having a difficult time wanting to continue playing. However I also want to say that this game was a neat idea, I've been searching for a game like this since Horizons and I of the Dragon. The customisation could use some more work, most changes you make to the characters by way of appearance don't actaully seem to show up. Keep working on it, could be a great game once it gets some polishing done! At the moment I have to say it's not worth the amount I paid for it, but I can understand that the money will contribute to the improvement of the game. I hope to see it get some work done, please don't abandon it like so many other games! This is one genre of game left mostly untapped and we need more like it.			"

Nothing had changed.I tried to fly around but i couldn't turn at the right time and it was so laggy that i couldn't undestand where i was turning.The only enemies I found were: two women, a bear, a moose or something like that (can't remember the name right now)...well, the ladies died like instantly and they just ran towards me and stopped right in front of me ready to be barbecued, but the other two...they we're like satan was disguised as an animal, they just didn't move, well the moose thing did jump but never moved away, it just jumped around. I tried to kill them with fire, no damage or they didn't feel the power of my flame or something...tried to claw them, and a strange red aura went around them and disappeard living the animal still alive waiting for more pain...I have made some screenshots, so maybe check them out.As a final conclusion I'd say: Buy the game, try to play it, get distressed after 20 min, hope for improvement cause the idea is there, even if the graphics aren't that good, the idea is there (grow your dragon, get stronger, explore, save mankind or destroy it) but the ideas aren't quite in the game yet.So buy it and wait for the release, hoping that they won't destroy everything.Bye,Vetens			"

								I know this game is quite unfinished, and Early Access Game state.It's kinda disappointment, there's alot of glitches in there. Camera and your dragon sometimes twist in random angle. And somehow you finds some pointless of this game. etc. But I don't care very much.Personally, I like the dragons. This game looks like an inspiration of ""I of The Dragon"" development since 2004, I like that game also. That you flys over the landscape, and killing the monsters. However, I'm still looking forward for this game until to final game. I might be recommend for this game...but It's still in under development...I suggest you to buy this game on final release! and let see how worth it... "

								At this stage (being written as of 8.5), there are still bugs, but less than there was beforeSome oft these bugs may still exist, though, as i have yet to test them due to being stuck on the same maountainous world (more on that in bugs/issues). That being said, i'll leave past comments there, but they will be marked with ""(8.04)"" after them, and at the end of the section. Bugs/Issues ---YOU CANNOT QUIT THE GAME NOMALLY ONCE YOU'RE IN. Once you're in the game, the pause menu only brings up the new tabs (dragon, grow, hoard) and the options of ""Resume,"" ""Respawn,"" ""Controls and Tips,"" and ""Options."" There is no option to quit. Looking at other screenshots of the game, all the menus are in the right places, but i think instead that it's the UI that isn't scaling correctly relative to the developer's resolution, resulting in either inaccesible or overlapping (or both) buttons.---If you choose to respawn, you'll be stuck at a loading screen for an indefinite amt of time (i sat at the loading screen after respawning for around 7 minutes)---Upon creating a dragon, no matter the kind, when looking at it in the selection screen, it will always show as a ""Drake, Green Dragon"" (the devs noted this in their update notes)---Even with the deletion of an old dragon and the creation of a new one, you still have the same hoard, the same stats, and spawn on the same map (regardless of which map you choose)---After picking my map for the first time, get used to it, because you will be stuck there FOREVER. -Even after reloading and selecting a different map, you will be sent to the same map you were just at.---The music/sound effects are quiet, and there are no volume options in the ""Options"" menu---You have to look directly at a target, so you don't know if it's dead or not (The only way i can tell is if the health ticker stops counting down, as well as the sound effects from said creature stopping)---there is no enemy health bar (which would be really useful)---enemies pile onto the center of your dragon, making them difficult, if not impossible to kill---trees still don't bleed---M3 (clicking the mousewheel) for tail bash doesn't work---what is M5? (for a fireball)---the funfacts at the loading screen pop by too fast to read it all accurately---you can't see the ""Play"" button on lower resolutions, but even on hiugher resolutions it is stacked under the ""Your Dragons"" button---Starving still has no consequence---having the ability to walk through small houses (8.04)---floating stuctures (8.04) But there are some good things! ---eating is no longer instantaneous---the day and night cycle is excellent and pretty---there is now a health counter (for yourself, at least)---you can no longer fly off the edge of the map---the map is of colossal and realistic size---animations are very smooth---fun combat (even with enemies climbing onto you, lol)---you no longer fly up faster than you fly forward---scrolling up in the ""Grow"" menu reveals money! One gold unit is 65 actual gold into your hoard, instantly. Be rich!---Hunger now depletes at a rate relative to what you're doing (standing, running, flying), and at a much more reasonable rate---no more glitching water (8.04)---swimming! (though your head is underwater) (8.04)---the developer(s) makes almost *no* contact with their community. we don't know if it's still being worked on, and (i feel) we have little input on the next features to be implemented/bugs to fix~I've not entered any cave yet (as none have spawned for me in either the past version or the current one)~I've also not experimented with the effects of weight and armors on flying and combatIt's exactly what it says to be—Dragon The Game. It is also still in early access, and the bugs listed in the first portion are accaptable (for now). And, unlike many other early access games i've heard of, the devs are still working on it (and from what i can tell, progress will only be getting faster from here!)It's an excellent game with immeasurable potential, and things will only get better from here.

Early Access Review
								Feburary, 2015 was when I first gave this game a review. I gave it a thumbs up because it had potential.  Sadly I'm going to have to update this review, as of January 2017, and change it to a thumbs down only because I just remembered that I backed this disgrace on both Early Access and then on their (somehow successful) Kickstarter.I bought this game initially when it first crept onto Steam in Early Access form.  It was a little square of land floating in the endless void where you got to move around a shoddy looking dragon asset, fly around haphazardly and burn some villager and goblin assets.  Even then, in the most barebones, tech-demo-y existence of this game it was more playable then than it is now.  Let this sink in.Two years ago, the game was more stable than it is right now.These days, despite a few additions of enemies and ground textures, the game has made almost no positive changes.  But it has made changes.  Oh yes, the game's stability has actually degraded over the last year or so.  The dragon controls terribly, buttons simply do not work, commands are mapped to mouse buttons that don't exist on most commercial mice, enemies still try to kill you long after you killed or even ATE them, the game crashes frequently and such a simple looking game runs awful on even high end computers.  Did I mention there was, or might still be, an achievement that's granted if you go into a cave lair and get stuck there?  Because that's acceptable.  The lair isn't there anymore, to my knowledge.There is nothing redeeming here.  There's no fun gameplay loop here.  It's a herculean effort just to get the game to work on your computer. The thing that really stings the most is the complete lack of communication from the developers to their EA Steam community.  Long bouts of silence broken up by non-updates if the community got too silent and goes so far as to childishly insult its concerned stakeholders because they are rightfully upset about the product they might have double-dipped funds into in hopes it would become their dream dragon game.I really wanted this game to be good.  I still do, in fact!  But honestly, if its incredibly small but incredibly dedicated fanbase tried, they could probably make a far better game in half the time.Pros?  Nothing.  Cons?  Everything.  Avoid.  The Dragon Dream remains a dream, for now.This was my previous review in Feburary 2015:This game is very promising.  It's like a dragon egg starting to bump around and crack the shell.  From what I've seen of Red Level Games they seem to be passionate about the project and are using the funds they recieved already from Early Access to hire more people to their team.  Updates are oncoming and just had one recently to its beta client.  If you're looking for a finished game I obviously cannot reccomend it, but the game has a long way to go and the devs and players know it.  However, if you look at the money as an investment and you're really interested in seeing this project come into fruitation for the ultimate dragon game, then I'd give it a buy.  Flying around burning stuff is fun in its own right.  I find myself logging on occaisionally to the live client just to torch some goblins or townsfolk, while also attempting to break the stamina bar in order to continuously accelerate in the air, flying at Mach 2 before crashing into a mountain.  All I can say is, as of right now it's a mildly fun but flawed dragon flight simulator with some objects to torch.  But I hope that this game sticks it out in the longrun. "

								Alright. It has been, what, a year and a half now? The only ""updates"" I have seen are a dragon model that i've seen in other games, so its not original, a new but even poorer quality map, and an ""upgrade"" system that doesnt even work. I'm disappointed that this game has gone hardly anywhere since I bought it. If this game doesnt show promise in the next few months, I'm going to be pretty upset. My review used to be positive, but the lack of updates is pretty frustrating. Wait much longer to work on the game, and someone else is going to make a game JUST like this and finish it. And this game will still be a work in progress.			"

Early Access Review
								I would not recommend this game simply becuase of the many bugs and performance issues, it crashes every few seconds and is abandoned at a very early stage by the devs all in all this game is a failure i was hoping otherwise but no this game its just too far gone ide recommend not wasting your money on this game as theyre already having another game exzactly like it greenlighted... i mean come on man if your gonna do a game dont just dish game after game our without ever finishing it its rediculous all in all the game is horrible and the devs... i dont even think itde be a good idea to trust them from what ive heard from others theyre shady as hell.
