												Pros: This is a very nice enjoyable combat simulator. Its's arcade style, but you can fly it with a joystick or gamepad. The game makers put a lot of effort in the missions.  Some of them seem to actually have a historical source. In this game you get to dogfight in multiple World War 2 fighters. You can even choose to get into an Axis fighter to fight the Japanese. Also nice are the multiple views like 3rd person, from the hood of a plane or  cockpit view. So you can always choose what you like. This game has a full campagne coop. Yes people you can play this game with 3 online team mates. So I had many hours of double fun with this game. Cons: The game always starts with me in windowed mode. Also I have to adjust the settings for my screen in game all the times when I start this game. These are just minor bugs and more a nuisance then a real burdon. Also the volume in the game is quite loud making it difficult to hear my mates on teamspeak. So before I start this game I have to adjust the volume settings in Teamspeak. Also a minor bug. All and all a very good game with nice graphics. It brought me back into the fierce combat  of World War 2 Pacific theatre. Definitely a good bang(s) for a bug.			"

												Too expensive for what you get, War thunder's much better, spend Â£29.99 on warthunder.			"

												Console port style controls. Throttle is buttons only.If you have a flight stick, forget it.If you want a flight sim, play something else. "

												This is an ok arcade flight sim.  A little choppy but workable frame rates.  It will do until someone makes a decent flight sim again.			"

												It is quite possibly a reasonable game. I cannot get the keyboard, a microsoft freestyle pro or a logitech extreme 3d pro to work with it. So I guess I will never know.  More programmers who obviously don't have a clue.			"

												Found it easier for myself to avoid playing it rather than trying to fit in in the control schemes provided (other problems aside). Make yourself a service and check out forums prior to buying, as it may save you some money. Also good idea would be to at least wait for a discount, if you have to test your luck.			"

												Nothing works on the game. I spent 46 minutes trying. example: Control confiuration  had the following buttons (Nav)(Restore)(Back)(Select) none of them worked. There was absolutely no button, key, or joystick control that did anythingto (thrust)(throttle) This thing is a total disaster and I want it removed from my library and my computer. Needless tosay I am not going to pay 39 bucks for it. I'm not going to pay anything for it. I will forward this information to VISA explaining the misrepresentation involved as spelled out above.If you dissagree with this contact me via email or 772 569 3350			"
