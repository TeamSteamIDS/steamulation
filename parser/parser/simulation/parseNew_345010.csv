								***NOTE**** GAME HAS PREMIUM ACCESS which is not made clear, the free version of the game is availiable on the website and runs EXACTLY the same as this version ie with the lag and bugs.By buying the game on here you are merely paying a 3 month subscription to the game and getting nothing any differnt to the unity browser game on the website.The game has amazing potential but atm its a total rip-off.All the people writing comments regarding my playtime, i played many hours BEFORE i got the steam version......To state that the steam version offers more features less bugs etc is total balls, it plays exactly the same the only thing you get is MORE of the same whcih in an mmo these days is akin to Pay to Win.As stated hiding the fact its premuim access you are actually buying on steam is the issue that no one really has agrued with......

								After a week of playing I have had to change my review to negative. I will keep it simple.Pros-Helpful communityInteresting flight mechanicCons-Terrible interfaceExhausting game mechanicsNo purpose/ reward for exploration and buildingNo real pve challenges(like aliens or space monsters) There is no risk in the game at all, given time you can do anything without ever losing a ship.This is not Eve without pvp. I would describe this game as a chat room where you move resources around in space. Everyone in the game is very nice, but I have to be honest. "

Early Access Review
								I started playing this game late in 2013.  I registered in the beginning of 2014, and my adventure started from there.  This game has been unique to me in so many aspects, I really don't have the room in a review to talk about them all.  The sandbox aspects, the fact it's an indie game by basically a one-man-team, or the fact it's the most expansive space-sim I've played to date, bringing back nostalgia of Freelancer.One thing that has kept me going is the continuous rise of the community.  Slowly, we had less than five active players for weeks on end.  Then a few dozen in the next months.  Eventually, the game expanded and more players joined, and I really felt the small part of the mysterious galaxy we were all in come alive.  Industry was a boon, mining operations became a thing, and eventually the galactic market was properly being utilized which was surprising to many of us so early on.I eventually had to take a break to focus on real life, but this game was always great about treating you right.  I could play for 15 minutes or 12 hours a day, didn't matter - I progressed.  I could skip weeks or months at a time, didn't matter, I could start off right where I left off.  It's always been a pleasure seeing the game constantly updated on a daily basis.  It's been even more of a pleasure having a dev who will directly communicate and give his time of day to the players.I was a skeptic at first, but soon came to truly believe in there being billions of solar systems to explore, everything procedurally generating to be a unique experience every time.  Eventually, players started exploring and graphing charts of planets and moons to settle on.  Then players started constructing gates, expanding the inner systems, and really bringing the heart of the game to life - the reconstruction of the empire of humanity.It's been over a year now, and myself and other older vets have watched this game bloom like a beautiful flower, and I'm proud to write such a positive review for it.  I could sit and try to come up with excuses all day long, but I honestly can't, this game has been going in the right direction nonstop, and has never ran out of *ahem* Steam.If you want to see what the game looked like a year ago - and my basic introduction to it, check out my youtube channel:  http://www.youtube.com/sinstrite  There are also new videos being uploaded right now, based on my attempt at a Let's Play of the game.  I don't think a Let's Play has been attempted with a game quite like this, so I find it interesting myself how tough it is to actually product the content.Here are some helpful links!http://www.thespacegame.com - play in the web browser for freehttp://forum.thespacegame.com/index.php - the official forumshttp://wiki.thespacegame.com/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page - the official wikihttp://www.facebook.com/TheSpaceGame - the official facebook pagehttp://thespacegame.uservoice.com/forums/194252-general - vote for player ideasI really do advise the new player to visit the wiki.  Many veterans have put in a lot of work to build it from the ground up, and even as one of the oldest players I still find myself using it constantly.  Let it be your space-bible.Keep in mind that you purchased the game for $10.00 and paid another $10.00 for the three months of premium bundled with the purchase.  When you first start, do not use your premium right away, save it for when you will most be able to use it.Planetary Premium - $0.99 monthly - You get access to the six other planets to build settlements on.  As a free player you can only access Ceres for grain and Vulcan for Iron.  You will also be able to produce: titanium, carbon, aluminium, meat, fruit, vegetables.  This is very good for expanding your starbase later on which brings us to...Industry Premium - $0.99 monthly - Use this to expand your Apollo starbase to 100 rings (600 modules) and really pump out some products with your factories.  You can make a lot of progression this way as a new player, and I highly advise you to get all 100 rings going if you plan on building a colony later on.  This also allows you to use modules above class 5 such as the mining beam, ram scoop, salvage beam, etc.  This really is the best premium to purchase in my opinion.Combat Premium - $0.99 monthly - If you want to make some credits fighting in Janus A, you want to throw some huge guns on your ship.  With this premium, you can access all weaponry over class 5 which allows you to move to the highest rank, making around 60,000,000 each mission ;)For you want-to-be colony builders...  You need Stellar Credits.  Each premium gives you 100 stellar credits a month, so if you have all three premiums going, you get 300 SC a month.  A colony costs 80 a month to upkeep, so you can have three colonies just for having the three premiums.OSB - Starbases that can be attached to your colony in high orbit.  They costs SC if they are not attached, but are free if they are.Other acronyms:MB / ML - Mining Beam, Mining LevelRS - Ram ScoopTS - Trading SkillSB - StarbaseHD - HyperdriveCL - ClassMD - ModuleSY - ShipyardGH - Gas harvestingHydro - Hydrogen (used to power ships when hyperjumping)MP - Mechanical PartsEL - ElectronicsGR / Graph - Graphene (made from carbon)SC, SCC, SCoil - Superconducting CoilsNio - Niobium (mined from Columbite)Aut - Autunite (gives uranium for contracts)SS - Space StationKS - KickstarterSteamie - What the players who came in through the Steam purchases are calledElders - Players that have been around for a year or longerVets - Players that have played months before the Steam releaseIf I think of more I will add them, and one more thing.../ignore PLAYERNAME is your best friend.

								I followed this game for several months prior to buying it when it was released on Steam.With a gaming background that includes: Elite(C-64), Privateer(DOS), Freelancer, and Eve Online, this game piqued my interest when I came across it.Normally, I never, and I mean never, purchase an ""Early Access"" game. (you want my money, finish your work)However, after what I saw during those months I made an exception and took a chance.I am happy to say I was not disappointed.The good:The game is deep and theres plenty to do.Asteroid mining, trading, build settlements, build a starbase,salvage wrecks, acquire blueprints, research, build spaceships and modules,colonize planets, explore the galaxy (whoa 270 BILLION star systems!), and more.Think Eve Online without the ganking, drama and ""stuff"", add a touch of Freelancer you come pretty close.(Matter of fact, judging from the chat, there is a good amount of Eve refugees ingame)The community is amazing! Most are very helpful and trolls are minimal.The wiki is great and given the complexity of the game, I reference it very oftenTwo members have made a number of instructive ""youtube"" videosSinstriteSinstrite's ChannelWaervynWaervyn's ChannelThe game appears to be a labor of love for the developer.He logs into the game often and interacts with his players.He updates very often, on several occasions several in one day.(as of this writing its ver 1.3038. yesterday it was 1.3035)The game is surprisingly stable, expecially for an Early Access game.I may experience 1 or 2 crashes in 6 hours of gameplay.Frankly, I had a few full release games I wish were as stable.The BadGraphics (not terrible but sure can't list as good)The ingame computer commands.Please don't tell me spaceships are equiped with C-64 era computers.Frankly, typing and spelling are not my forte and the ol' eyesight isn't what it use to be and not getting any better. I'm not sure what, but there gotta be something better.The UglyRegistering was NOT intuitive.It took me several tries and I had to refer to an instruction video before I got it right.(note: I haven't looked at it since Feb 28 so don't know if this has been fixed)Concerns:The developer is somewhat lax in posting update announcements.While understandable in a one man operation, it gives a false impression as to how closely he supports the game.The website also needs an update. Unless one actually looks at the forms, one could easily get the false impression the game is not properly suported.I have zero issues with the present business model,BUT, at present, I cannot renew my subscription through Steam Wallet.Paypal is not an option for me and I'm very hesitant to use other methods.There's time yet to get it done but time marches on.I believe we ""Steamer""s have been good for the game, please make it easy for us to continue to support the game.The game impressed me enough to write a review, my first.I hope you find it useful.

Early Access Review
								I've been playing this game for a very long time, as you can see because ofthe many hours I've been in it.In spite of that my opinion about it is utterly negative.This isn't because of the community, one of the best I've encounteredso far, or the idea behind the game.The reasons I've come to dislike this game are the following ones:1) the developer is too slow in implementing new features and doesn'tfix many existing bugs for very long times. He's a one man team, true,but if he doesn't have much time why does he waste time in implementingnonsense like ""Cargo now ejects into crates - these can't be re-captured but they're fun to kick around"". This nonsense while there are lack of manyfundamental functions like a decent in game chat or the ability to changethe game login password!!!2) the developer is too self centered in developing features he likesthe way he wants without listening to the community. Take as an example the npc traders: they trade whatever they like atthe price they like and get only half of the goods you've in a stock market.Not to mention the stock markets are opened to anyone and you cannot implementyour own close loops. This kind of implementation is nice only in the developer's mind!3) the game learning curve is scary! Forget to log in the game and haveevreything you need to learn or to do right in one place: in the game itself!You have to read pages and pages of wiki and forum and even after that youwill need plenty of help from many experienced players.If you don't have too much time you play OR you spend hours reading poemsabout learning HOW to play.4) the in game chat is a joke... there is only one global room and nothing more.No trade chat, no private chats, no personal chats, no messaging system betweenplayers. Something you would expect from day 1 from any game developed in this age.There is barely an ignore feature, too bad it gets reset evrey time you log out.VERY useful!!!5) The interface is ugly and ludicrous. There are tons of textbooks explaining howto properly develop a nice basic game interface, but the developer is too busydeveloping useless features like the cargo crates mentioned in point 1).6) The game is gradually becoming a pay2win kind of game. Recently the developer addedtwo addons to the game: the bowhead and the hawk. If you don't pay you can't have themand they cost more than the game itself, which is utterly ludicrous.7) The game mechanics are grind galore. To make money there are basically two ways:keeping hauling goods from point A to point B or to mine asteroids. The hauling partis especially boring because doing the same set of actions hundreds of times per dayevrey day cause alienation in one's mind.8) the game is open ended, but in the sense it doesn't have any purpose after a certainstage. At the beginning you keep grinding to become bigger and bigger. After you havereached the top, meaning biggest ship and some colonies, you don't have nothing to dobasically. I don't like games which tell me what to do in a strict way, but mechanics to keep me busy at evrey stage of my gameplay are essential to keep my interest up.9) To extend further point 8) one of the best game mechanics would be npc space piratesattacking colonies and/or trading ships. Too bad the developer will implement this featurein his usual self-centered way: the npc pirates will be enabled/disabled using a checkbox...Who in the hell would enable such checkbox is beyond me!10) When there is too much noise about the way a feature is implemented the developer justcloses the threads in forum telling ""this isn't up for debate"" and that's it. What's the pointof having a forum? To exploit experienced players' knowledge to compensate the lack of any kindof decent tutorial/help in the game itself of course.Conclusion: Stay away from this game. There are much better options out there, better priced too!			"

												Ascent is a fantastic concept, a PvE version of EVE Online without the real time skill training. It is still early access, but it is my opinion that the direction of the game is going in such a way that a negative review was needed as a warning for future purchasers. If there was a ""neutral"" button for the review I would have used it.User InterfaceThe game’s user interface is horrid.  You will notice it the minute you hit the startup screen.  Instead of a login and character selection screen it has a button series that looks like a single player game, up to and including a “LOAD” button.  Fitting ship modules is a complex and clucky text selector box maneuver.CommunityThe community is friendly, and will answer basic questions in game chat. There is only one “global” game chat, and no in-game guilds or other such mmo “norms”. GraphicsThe game uses stock Unity graphics for the most part. The ships and starbases may have been a unity resource pack purchase. The game had a kickstarter specifically to add ship graphics, but everything else is very simplistic.  Planets are little more than a multicolored globe and your character avatar is a guy in a tee shirt and jeans. Still early access.Player CooperationThe game might as well be single player. Your “cooperation” with other players will be limited to buying stuff from them off a market board.  Even such grand ventures such as building a new jump gate basically boils down to hauling loads of minerals.  There is no “grouping” for combat, no sharing ownership or access to buildings, no real reason for other players to be in the game aside from a chat based social and game-economy aspect.Ship DesignEach ship “class” is just a different skin.  The only technical difference between the base ship “skins”  is that each class increase basically doubles the cargo space. There is a marginal difference in turning, but basically the only real game mechanic-based difference in the ships would be cargo space.  A higher level ship can equip higher level modules, such as a better mining laser.Grindy and RepetativeAscent is extremely grindy. You will buy and sell resources via NPC contracts, or buy and sell resources for other players, or mine.  Your ships cargo is the only limiter, when you purchase a new ship you gain more cargo space, thus the grind starts anew for the next ship.  You will also need to grind to purchase blueprints, planet plot deeds, and a hyperdrive.  ExplorationThis seems like a fun concept, and the developer brags about 300 billion star systems; however, you need cargo space to carry fuel for the hyperjump so you will need to grind a lot of money to purchase a decent sized ship and hyperdrive (ships on the NPC market do not come with them).  The ship’s hyperdrive allows you to explore and discover new star systems; however, they get more expensive the larger your ship is (almost always being the same price as the ship itself). For a game that brags about exploration, they sure do make it hard.Also, you get a star system named after you just for being the first person to jump to it. No real planet exploration is required.  Basically, you are getting credit for a ""discovery"" that was already made by some guy with a telescope years before.Pay To WinYou can skip the grind and buy a bowhead, one of the largest ships in the game. ComplexThe game has a steep learning curve. I did not mind this too much, but it is worth mentioning.  You will be doing a lot of wiki research and youtube video watching.			"

Early Access Review
								I started playing this game several days ago before the Steam release because I couldn't wait for the release (with over 40hrs of playtime) I'm glad I did as well. This game is amazing on so many levels. It's well worth the $20. There are some caveats however that are worth noting to those thinking about purchasing.The game purchase will get you most of the features in the game except for full colonies. To have full colonies you will need to have a premium account. For all three premium features it costs $3 a month. The point to the premium is to help support the cost of running the servers. Without premium you'll also only have access to one space station ring, with premium you get up to 100. When you purchase the game you will get a 3 month trial of the premium service so you can try out colony building if you so desire.Even with the above caveat this is still not a pay to win game. You don't need to have premium to have a full immersive experience of the game. Here's a list of the pro's/cons of the game:Overall rating 9/10+Huge universe with 270 billion star systems with only a handful having been discovered so far.+A very friendly and helpful community+Fast space travel (seriously fast autopiloting system & warp gates)+Resource harvesting including asteroid mining, gas harvesting by skimming gas giants, colonies that mine resources+Smooth stable game play client & server (In over 40hrs of playing I have had the client crash once and almost no lag or latency issues)+Developer that logs into the server and gets input from his players!+Good tutorial that isn't overbearing (think breadcrumbs)+Good selection of ships that aren't too difficult or time consuming to get.-Registration is a tad confusing for new players and is on the list to be reworked/fixed-Graphics are not the best compared to other games out there however with graphics at max it still looks amazing-Need premium to access colonies (as noted above)Some special notes:Mining: Mining is not the boring thing I've experienced in most space games where you just find the rocks and shoot them to harvest. In this game the different asteroids have different compositions yielding different minerals/metals. Also the asteroid fields move, so the rocks don't just float in space. You have to match speeds with them and carefully fire your mining laser. The idea is to heat up the rock to a certain temperature to yield the materials. Too cold and it doesn't work, too hot and the rock explodes yielding you nothing. So, you have to pay attention to your mining beam and shut it off at the right time. Also, the range of each class of beam is different, at first you have to get within 1,000 meters to mine an asteroid.Trading: The game has a very well thought out trade infrastructure and system. Each of the core systems has a NPC Space Station that has a local market where you can sell goods & materials. Each station also specializes in producing one material for sale. Each core station also has a contract board where npc's offer contracts for needed items, passenger ferrying, blueprints for sale (for colonies & player stations), specialized colony supplies/materials, package deliveries etc. The contract board changes every hour, :15 after and :45 after the hour. The Galactic Market (or player market) is where players can offer goods for sale across the whole galaxy that can be searched from anywhere then when bought players have to travel to the selling location to pick up the goods. Also player colonies have stock markets where player harvested goods are bought and sold. With a little bit of time and help from the players you can make a lot of money trading on player stock markets or selling mined goods to colonies.Warp gates: outside the core 8 systems traveling requires a hyperdrive that burns hydrogen. So if you want to explore you will need those things and have some good skill in gas giant skimming. Also over the last several months several of the colonies just outside of the core 8 have developed into core systems and have built their own warp gates to the core systems. There are several gates being built now (requiring huge amounts of resources) these could be opportunites for traders and miners alike providing the resources for such gates. Also if one were to invest enough time and resources into a new system they could build their own gates to and from the core systems making player trading more viable and cost efficient. "

								My updated video review:


YouTube™ Video: Ascent: The Space Game: Review 

			Views: 3,742		

			Today I review Ascent: The Space Game. I try to give an objective view on the game, and discuss whether it could be worth your money or not.		

------------------------------------My older text review:Wow...where do I start?Absolutely amazing game. The game is very immersive. Asteroids orbit around planets, you can land on planets to build things there, the crafting system is very complex and interesting, and you can even build your own space station which you can expand with many different kind of modules.Pros:- Very immersive environments. The space art is very nice and the planets look cool. Asteroid fields feel 'alive' with a lot of movement.- Great mining system. Mining is terribly boring in EVE, X, Elite Dangerous and Starpoint Gemini. However, here the mining is spiced up due to two facts:1) the asteroids have their own speed and your mining beam only has a 1km range, so you need to keep up with it (or fly very close to it)2) The amount you mine is dependent on the temperature of your mining beam. Beam too little and your yield is bad. Beam too much and you get nothing at all!- 250 billion systems to explore, that get named after you if you find them first! These systems can contain planets, which you can do geological research on to find out what it offers in terms of minerals etc. Other people (and you) can then colonize these planets, building factories etc. on them to profit from this planet.- Player-made economy! Everything except for the most basic resources are farmed/mined/made by the players to sell on the market!- You have to work for your things, and feel accomplished after you get a new ship or some other nice thing. Some people might mistake this for grindyness, which I wouldn't agree with (this comes from a person that absolutely despises 'daily quests' etc.).Cons:- some people dislike the graphics. I must say, when you're playing it, I think it looks gorgeous. Yes, the shipmodels are undetailed, but somehow they still look nice when you play it. But then again, I never cared for graphics that much (love Dwarf Fortress for example), so I might not be the right person to ask- complicated at times. If you want to play this game, you'll have to be ok with reading up on the wiki. While features are being added, things like ejecting cargo is done at the moment through a command console. I expect buttons for this will be made at some point, but they're not implemented yet (you can program in keybinds to eject cargo etc. though, but for this you need to read up).All in all, I'm in love. I would summarize it as a PvE version of EVE online. It's very much focussed on industry etc. instead of PVP/ganking.			"

Product received for free
Ascent is a deep colonization sandbox economic sim with unparalleled tech & scientific design. It's a combo of running the stock market, while setting up a space station for your own business in the stars. You mine, research, build, & generally act like a galactic Marco Polo, with as much or as little emphasis on either as you choose. You also take roles that resemble a tech tycoon like Steve Jobs, or an Admiral like Chester Nimitz of the US Navy. It also features political roleplay. The game is PVE focused. Combat is an option. You can choose to gain loot fighting pirates, as well as looking for wrecked ships by buying the location coordinates off the markets. You scan the wreckage & receive blueprints to design your own ship parts. You may choose to build a smuggling operation, by contacting npc’s on starbases & asking them to buy contraband. Once you’ve set up your contacts, you call them when ready to deliver, & bribe or avoid the guards to make the deliveries. &, best of all to me, you explore uncharted stars & they are named after you on the map. Gameplay:In Ascent, you have a persistent universe that provides a validity to your actions, a sense of player agency, because what you do matters. If you terraform a planet, other players can colonize on your planet also. You’ve created a new world with a breathable environment.To move around in the universe, you use the autopilot to take jump gates from planet to planet (or moon.) Or, you can use hydrogen & hyperdrives for FTL jumps. It has a few bugs. Nothing that affects enjoyment of the game, but IMHO, it probably was rushed out of EA a little fast (unlike some who flounder there forever.) Usually restarting the game clears any bug. They are regularly introducing new features, & working out the bugs. But, there's lots of info in the community wiki & on Waervyn’s World YouTube.Narrative:The game is built upon the premise of a world that has fallen into chaos. Your mission is to reorganize the world by setting up bases of operations in the inner 9 systems, then push outward to explore the stars beyond. The game has incredibly good voice acting & numerous missions that guide you through the story.The actual flight tutorial doesn’t seem very good, only causing stress to the new player, leaving you confused as to the focus of the game. Just say no to that, open the wiki, & jump right in with the WASD interface. The early Susan Steele Missions function as a de facto tutorial. After you do the few Steele missions, you then have a while to explore & expand before the later missions pop up. A simple & clear guide to the early game missions is Learning to Ascend’ by Max PowerMechanics:The mechanics let you feel like you are doing more than button pushing. Mining is like a dance with the asteroid. You pilot your ship to within close range of the rock, engage your gravity anchor to slow you down, & maintain a speed that matches the velocity of the asteroid while beaming it with your mining laser. You have to watch the color of the laser to know when you’ve heated it long enough to get the max elements from it. Too long will burn it up & you get nothing. If you are good at playing the market, you can search the stock market for incredible deals on most rare elements, available for you to just pick them up at the seller’s location. Graphics/ Sound:Ascent has simplistic graphics but is very deep technologically. It can be compared to games like Civ V & XCOM: Enemy Within, & fits somewhere in the middle as far as graphics design goes, with Civ V having the flat map, 2D perspective, with overlays for different actions, & popup messages; & XCOM having a 3d map system & voice-acting enrichment. You can really appreciate the fact that 1 man accomplished so much. The graphics are not of a quality you get from larger dev teams, with some flaws. But, they are totally immersive. As a matter of fact, the game ruined No Man’s Sky’s release for me. I got it a week before NMS finally launched, & now today stopped playing long enough to download NMS, only to find myself logging out again & firing back up Ascent. The maps are composed of a backbone of beautifully designed planetary art that you fly through in real-time within a celestial body’s range of view. These maps are lovely & each system has from 3-30 moons, gas giants, & rocky planets, each with their own design. For an idea of ship art, & to compare sizes, see my screenshots.The music is played at key moments, keeping distractions to gameplay to a minimum. The avatars are limited by 4, 2 each of male & female; with no choice for personalization. The ships can be painted, with rgb color sliders, so basically you have to mix the colors to get the color you want. It feeds the Science/Sci-fi feel to the game.MultiplayerIt is billed as an MMO simple enough for beginners to be able to get into. &, it does seem to be. The system seems less complex than other MMO's. I think that if there is a good starting place, this may be it. Ascent is the 1st MMO I’ve been able to successfully navigate. Being an older gamer, with a 20+ year gap in my gaming experience, I was thrilled to find an mmo that offers intelligently creative gameplay & still provides an ease of access for the casual gamer. There is a fanatic (& friendly) player base in Ascent. I’ve already clocked over 138 hours as of writing this review, & I’ve had the game about 9 days. Money (& Time) Matters:Ascent is underpriced at $20 bucks. I’ve enjoyed it more than Stellaris, because of the gameplay. The premium is unnecessary for those who just want to play normally. You would have to subscribe for a year for the cost to even approach the normal price of games like this. The 2 dlc ships are not only unnecessary to gameplay, since one is a class 1 support ship, & the other is a huge Bowhead too bulky for mining. Rather, they are novelties from the kickstarter reward tiers sold to finance the dev team, keeping the price of the game so cheap for others not interested in novelties. The best ship I’ve found so far for mining is the Mammoth class 10, because of its cargo capacity & maneuverability. I do love flying the different ships.You are sure to find many hours of your life lost to this game. It comes bundled with 3 free months of the premium access, which is not auto activated when you begin playing. I waited to activate my premium access until I had over 90 hours in the game. I could have waited longer, but I was limited to settlements on only two of the inner 9 planets, & only one ring on my inner starbase, &, I couldn't equip a hyperdrive above class 5 on a ship. (Same goes for ship combat weapons.) Trading cards for collecting art; as well as a nice artbook & music dlc package would be nice for those of us who like to see the creative process behind the game.Pros: *Space flight is all very realistic *Experience of a space traveler/ merchant miner*Results are skill-based, rather than luck or an old RNG*Pure Sic-fi …game backed by real Science*Provides a command line computer for conducting research & geological surveys Cons: *Preset instructions flash for only a second. Change that in options before you start*While in Shipyard, offers flash too fast for choosing, needs to be changed *Small bugs can be corrected by exiting game & reloading (works fast)*Needs an in-game logbook & a Transaction/Travel Record* A stock ticker on the hud would be a nice additionSometimes artistry is lost for the sake of making money. But, Fluffy Kitten Studios have created a work of heart, which is apparent in their pricing model as well as their gameplay.  I highly recommend Ascent for those of us for whom the world is not enough. One world, that is. In Ascent, many worlds will open up before you; worlds of celestial bodies, worlds of gameplay, & worlds of scientific exploration. "

Early Access Review
								For such a small development team with limited funds and an Early Access state, the game is amazingly stable. Granted I've played for about 4 hours as of writing this, but I have the graphics maxed out and have not experienced a single crash. The game could be a bit better optimized, but I wouldn't expect that at this stage. There's a few little strange graphical glitches but nothing game breaking. For example, if you buy a new ship your UI doesn't reflect the new stats unless you go back to the Main Menu and then load the map again. On that note, this reminds me of Eve. It's a massive grind to get good progress and the game is insanely overwhelming; however UNLIKE Eve, you can get a solid grasp on the game within a couple of hours and it's all easy from then on. If you have questions, the community is very nice and mature and is always willing to help you.So far I haven't had the opportunity to build anything yet, the few hours seem to be all about delivering goods and giving people rides to other space stations so you can earn anough credits to buy bigger ships. I haven't even touched the surface of the game and so far it's pretty impressive. It's about as intuitive as you can get for such a massive scale space MMO. Until my view of this game changes, this post will reflect my current opinion.  An excellent game with a very active developer.			"

Early Access Review
								I've been playing this game for about 2 weeks now. First I want to address the most common complaints:a) It's pay to win? The DLC Bowhead certainly gives you a lot of cargo space with which to make money, since the game doesn't lock ship size to any player stat other than affordability. But the game has access to bigger ships than the Bowhead, all without the DLC. Making credits is ridiculously easy. I have the next ship in size to the DLC one, the Archon, and could have an even bigger one if that's what I chose to focus on. That's after 2 weeks play.b) hidden subscription? The game does tell you that the $20 current purchase price includes 3 weeks of premium. Not having premium does restrict what class weapon you can mount (meaning you mount more, smaller weapons) and other restrictions. But the sub price is 1, 2, or 3 dollars a month depending on what you want to do in game. Really, I spend that much daily on coffee. Ever since I've been playing MMO's I've been used to $15 a month subscrptions, and that seems fair.About the positives- love the depth of the game. The longer you play the more you realize there is a lot out there to do, and to learn, and to build! I even tried combat route, which isn't my forte, and found it interesting. There are updates coming to the UI and the combat system. Me, I love the building starbases and colonies aspect of the game.It's crazy interactive. Take mining for example. Find the right asteroid, match speed and direction of travel, open up your mining beam and heat it up to the precise temperature- less and you reduce the yield, more and you might explode it. All while moving! Swap out ship modules to optimize the ship to your playstyle, balancing space vs utility.It's.. huge. At my stage of the game I look at the systems far away waiting for me to investigate... and procedurally generated space means there will be more when I get there, generated as I arrive- named after the discoverer! That is still a month away game wise for me.The dev is extremely involved, and very positive. Check the game forums, won't cost you anything, and see the bug reports and the actions taken. The community is extremely helpful, in advice as well as hands-up, and will steer you right. They are eager to make the game as good as it can me.Hey, this is where I spend my free time. IF you like social interaction, building, mining, combat, this is it. If you prefer to play with cooperative players and away from player harrasment, this is definitely the place.			"

												The best thing about this game, is the players. Unfortunatly the game sucks, dot because its a bad game concept. There are some critical bugs that the dev is ignoring. In fact hes ignoring everything, ever his loyal subscribers, which is another issue. I 1st thought this game was brilliant, untill i got to the poosition of having a big enough ship and credits behing me to go exploring and setting up new bases. 1st issue is the time investment needed to set up a base. You have to wait 50 hours for the dome to build, and hope it do not float, or sink after you have built it, making it useless. Then You must wait 24 hours to purify gasses, and then 22 hours for anything else to build. That is not the real issue except for the floating,sinking bases. You are charged stella credits for each base you have, no problem, the problem is the feature to ""abandon base"" was ommited recently, so You will be charged real world money for every base you can not abandon.My count is at 8 that im being charged 80 Stella Credits per month for, that are totally useless to me and can no longer abandon. So i write bug report, what reply do i get....nada,zilch, nothing, zero... except from as i said ""best thing about this game is the dedicated players"" especially a character called ""ram"" who is so dedicated to this game, the dev should make a deal with him to manage its development, and the dev should get back to doing what he is able to do, and thats code.There is no option to cancll your subscription, so only way is to make a new real world bank account.Dev really needs to get his act together and prioritise critical issues, especially 1 that involves taking money from peoples bank accounts, and not run around trying to raise money, something that should have been done prior to release, or employ/make deal with someone who is experienced in doing so. People would make deals with the dev, but it appears the dev wants to do everything, and be in total controll, without anyone else advising him how to do it, and delegate responsibilitys to them.

I Almost Missed OutI almost didn't buy this game.  It is not polished, and there are so many early access games that disappoint.  I don't even remember what made me pull the trigger, but I'm so glad I did!  I would happily pay many times the price on Steam and here is why:First person spaceship piloting... yes, you can fly everywhere in first person!Exploration... at the current rate of player expansion, it will take 10,000 years to explore every star system.  And every star you find is named after you!Trade... it has an extensive resource gathering and trade system.Building... you can build, customize, and paint your own ships.Colonies and empires... you can found your own colonies on distant worlds and build your empire.Helpful community... just ask and someone will answer your questions in game.Depth... the unpolished graphics and user interface hide a depth of gameplay that could provide enjoyment for years. Its not finished... all this, and yet major new features and content are being developed and delivered.Have a problem? The developer responds personally to your bug reports!I am really glad I tried this game!			"

												I've played Ascent for 2 months now and I'm giving it the flick.  Frustrating, unfinished game with lots of potential. The everything is just too hard to do. Only the most basic trading and crafting what there is in the game to do it so damb hard to do.  Try building an Outer Star Base!  Good luck.The most disapointing thing is, nothing is getting fixed.  Two months after release and nothing has changed. Prime continues to crash, your research takes forever to update, making you fly into and out of systems just to get the database to up date to tell you where your research actually is.Just annoyingly frustrating.  Fantasic group of people though.might drop in and see how it is going in 6 months or so, it may be playable then.			"

Freaking awesome!!. So I can have fun without someone always trying to kick over my apple cart...I don't care much for in-game corporations or groups. I just want to play w/o chatting or having to attended meetings. lolTheir are a tone of pvp games out there. No need to make this one as well. Just sick of the pvp debates. open vs solo play in Elite Dangerous, EVE etc.Ascent is truly a breath of quiet fresh air...!Runs really well, no crashes, and the wife says I'm playing too much, so there ya go. Its a hit!!Keep up the good work Mr developer.See u out there... "

												As of writing this review I am new to the game.So for now we can call it : ""A first Impression"".I do recommend Ascent.***The Good***- Feels like an open world in space with no limits to what you can do.- The community is extremely mature and helpful.- A ""carebear"" PVE experience that doesnt leave you worried about wether you have time being loged in or not. Log in even for a few minutes and pick up later exactly where you left off without the risk of loosing anything while you are logged off. So far I have discovered many activities to be done:   - Trading, be it with NPCs or players.   - Mining astroids.   - Collecting atmospheric gas to sell or use in your colonies oxygen production or for fuel.   - Exploring star systems and planets (some star systems have good astroid belts to mine for material or planets with a good agriculture and inhabitation potential).   - Transporting passangers and packages.   - Fighting pirates.   - Building your own star base that can be used for researching, manufacturing and as a trading post.   - Building your own colony on a planet to increase the size of the human race in space =), produce goods for trade and provide coloniests that can be hired for work. Finding a planet to colonize involves sampling its land and atmosphere and deciding wether its worthy or not of human colonization in relation to the future aim of this colony.   - Smuggling non legal goods into colonies of players that decided that their citizens shouldnt consume drugs, smokes, alcohol etc.   - Taking part in politics in order to build a ""better universe"" ordering warp gates to more remote star systems.   - Ships can be built, bought and equiped with modules that also can be built or bought relevant to what you like to do (cargo hauling, gas skimming, mining, fighting etc.)   - Eventually the aim of Ascent is to spread cooporativly the human race by the colonization and the building of a logistical and an economical working system in space. With the mutual effort of many players together warping gates can be built in between selected star systems to allow easier movement from place to place. ***The Bad***- Some graphical glitches occur but nothing that makes the game unplayble, other than that the graphics are actually pretty enough considering one doesnt need a strong system to run the game.- The learning curve requires you to do some reading in the in-game help articles.***To summerize:***In case you are looking for a relaxed online space game that is dealing not with warefare but with the cooporative colonization of space you should definetly give this game a try becauseAscent is a PVE space MMO that is dealing not with destruction but construction.

								(Updated below)There has been mixed thoughts on the game so let me clear this up before you take the negative thoughts of the game and decide it's not for you: A lot of what people DISLIKE about the game is simply from misunderstanding the game and/or the game concept. Meaning the following:- It's not P2W- There is NO PVP (Weather they add a area for it in the future I am not sure)- You DO NOT have to pay a subscription fee, that is purely optional, if you do enjoy it though please do as it helps the dev team out a lot - It's ONLY $3 - Can't afford that per month? Then you probably shouldn't be thinking about buying a new game to begin with..- There are bugs of course, it's still a new game - The dev is VERY active in game, forums and steam discussions.- If you can't do X because of X then make sure to use the ingame chat (see neg review about fitting modules to ships, I had same ""issue"" but chat told me how to do it in less than 30 seconds) it's probably not the game, just you overlooking something- GRAPHICS are getting improved eventually, they know they suck, but they are coming along slowlyFinally have time to actually write something about the game so here goes.Most of you have probably played EVE or something similar so if you have you will instantly fall in love with the game. At the minute the graphics are below par but the dev has officially said the HUD and graphics are next on the priority list to sort out so stay tuned!The gameplay is brilliant, it's immersive regardless of the poor (I say poor, but comparing something to EVE anything looks poor) graphics, you are not just sent out to right click an astroid until your cargo hold is full. Mining actually means finding astroids that move and not just float there waiting to be camped for hours, same with the gas, you work to ""mine"" and feels like you are doing something instead of just going afk waiting for materials.The building system I don't have much experiance with, I believe my grain farm has just been completed, it seems simple enough and looking forward to building more, generating materials and suppling people with the mats. Jumps gates come in very hand, theres a map with a basic bookmark feature at the minute so if you find somewhere good make sure to bookmark it! Everything is player made so if you want to go deeper help each other out and build new gates to go exploring the VAST world.The community are extremely helpful, it started with a small bunch of people in love with the game and are enjoying the influx of new players, very welcoming and always willing to answer questions, provide assistance and more.A few bugs to iron out, a few changes here and there but with the dev as active as he is I have no doubt it won't be long before this is a lovely polished game with a huge huge community.Check the game out on www.thespacegame.com "

								If you want EvE where you can land on planets:  RecommendedIf you hate long, tedious grinds, overcomplicated building systems, and you just want to go out and explore:  Not recommended. Really wanted to love this game; exploring an entire galaxy and forming colonies sounded amazing.However, this insane grind for resources and money really kills it for me.  From what I've seen, the reason this community is so small is due to players seeing how much time it takes to get a decent ship or set up a colony and gets turned away.I tried to tough it out, but the amount of time spent mining or trading instead of adventuring killed it for me.I see now that this game isn't about exploring, but it's a massive economy-based game.  Unfortunately, that's not my cup of tea.  I don't have the time or patience to sit through another EvE-like MMO like I did in college.Good game for those looking for an EvE-like MMO, but it's time for me to look for adventure elsewhere.  Fly safe.			"

								I got this game only hours after it lauched on steam. Since then I have played for hours on end and had a blast. The gameplay itself is fun, with a decent range of activities to entertain the average player (mining, ai pirate battles, colonization, and exploration), but the true appeal is the future possibilities.The game is primairly created by a one man team, who has thus far created day to day updates and bug fixes, constantly adding on to his creation. With a sand box of 270 billion galaxy's to explore and limitless opertunities to add new things it will greatly improve over time from its already fantastic foundation.I have dabbled with Eve online, but always wanted to directly control my ships. This provided in spades with realistic gravity physics and customizable parts for every ship available.			"

								The developer of this game has many good ideas, but is trying to reinvent the wheel, and does it at a snails pace. Many people say ""yes, but it's early access!"", yes it is early access, it's been that way for a very long time now, and I suspect it will stay that way.Graphics, Interface, controls, documentation, storyline, and many other things are poor or missing entirely.Developer does not implement major game design based on the communities likes, nor takes ideas that worked well in other games, that people liked, and instead uses his own ideas to try and be ""unique"" or ""innovative"" regardless if people like the features or not. The mining mini-game is a good example.It's a good game if you don't mind 90's graphics and want to play a game for 20 hours before your awaiting release of another game comes.			"

								Great idea for a game,..A very sandboxy PvE universe to explore and build your own little (or big) space empire in.  I honestly really like it and will keep playing, but it has at least a couple big problems that I will deal with for the moment considering it's still early access but it would be a joke if they weren't addressed before the official launch.  It pains me to give a thumbs-down but I will definitely change it if they work on these areas.1.  The Starship Computers:Holy Carap!  I don't know if it is meant to be somehow more gritty and ""realistic"" or if it is just a placeholder until someone gets around to making a menu and/or GUI interface.The current situation involves a command console type interface (think DOS or UNIX) to interrogate the computer for a lot of important information and functions especially when it comes to exploration.  It takes like 40 keystrokes to do what should be done in 4.  In terms of gritty it doesn't get much better than this but in terms of realism I think in an age of faster than light travel they would have a post-Apollo interface for their computer systems.  Getting to the point of making your own probes and figuring out what all the data means is hard enough...having to beat the info out of the computer is just plain unnecessary.  They certainly don't have to dump the console for people who want to think they are computer scientists, but a more user friendly option should be available for the rest of us living in the 21st century.2.  Chat Channel:...as in singular chat channel for the whole universe.No trade chat, no private chat...group or otherwise, no in game e-mail system....Wow!  You'd think that kind of stuff would be in any MMO on day 1.3.  Galactic Market (player auction house)Apparently the galactic market computer system is much more advanced than the on board ship computers because at least you don't have to shop via command console LOL....but...The only way to search items is by keyword, quantity, and price point.  Also, only 1 page can be displayed so if there are more results that you want to see you have to narrow your search to get them on the first page.The Good:1.   Friendly Community2.  Working Economy3.  Not overly buggy or crashy4. Generally playable and fun5.  Freemium model at $3/month is reasonable			"

												Not recommending this gameWhy:-Game has still feeling you are playing an alpha state game, but it is released as full game.-Playing can be fun for awhile if you like to grind grind grind grind grind grind...-Lots of bugsQuote from Store Page:""Ascent is a PVE sandbox space MMO with 270 BILLION star systems and an emphasis on strong Sci Fi. It encourages Exploration, Colonization, Research, Asteroid mining, Farming, Trading, and Combat.""-Strong Sci-fi? You can have different opinion.-Exploration? Ok, you jump into an unknown system and do sampling and research with a computer from late 70's. You have to type everything because there is no graphic interface. You find different kinds of systems, some has valuable asteroid fields which you can farm to give better yields. Planets are different and there's gas giants also for fuel scooping and grinding gas for selling.-Colonization? Ok, you may colonize planets with or without domes depenging of the atmosphere. This may be the only aspect of the game which is not grinding 24/7 (unless you bring a huge amount of NPC passengers as workers depending of the size of your colony. Note: You have to buy them from Inner Stations, which makes them slaves?).-Research?  At start you search wrecks for blueprint fractions, or buy full bluprints from stations. Then you have to ""research"" them in your research facility. Then you can upgrade your earlier research. This can take very very long, like weeks. Not very high end research system.-Asteroid mining, this is what I like, best mining system to date and you can farm asteroids to give better yields.-Farming? Yep, asteroids. I can't really say farming when you place a farm and then your warehouse magically get flled with grain, fruits, meat and vegetables-Trading? So boring trading system. Everybody makes same♥♥♥♥♥♥so who is buying? And if you make ships there will always be some people who gives ships for free or minimal fee so why buy ships? Only trading system worth making money is grind grind grind grind grind carbon from colonies to Inner Stations. Fun? NO!! It would be more fun if Hyperjumping wasn't so annoying with flashing white lights that you had to be braindead not having a seizure.-Combat? That was so awkward I decided not take part at it.			"

								Ascent:TSG is the ugly woman you married because she offers more depth than beauty. Her dedication to creating your unique universe is only comparable to the quality friends she keeps and the community services she provides.You don't want to show her in public, because her graphics are barely comparable to today's modern woman. But at home, between the bosoms of her cozy universe, she offers you to explore her star systems, to probe her planets, and to sample her soil. With some luck, her riches will open.She is so giving, so free from jealousy, that she bridles your constructive manhood need to do more, to please her by sharing her with people who understand her inner beauty. Her happiness is your ambition, to gather her spoils and to share your discovery with others. Your orbital space base and an extended jump gate will drive her to ecstasy.She can be complicated as her background knowledge comes from NASA, yet she shares a learning journey of science and physics, with the story of the destruction of humanity and the need to rebuild.  She wants you to be rich with passion and to shape her to your desires. She will remember you as you touch her virgin star systems, prominently etching your name into her universe as you prospect a new facet of her exquisite beauty.Her attractive secret is her potential to be more than she currently offers. Unseen by other woman you may have experienced, she challenges you every month with new features; a new way to re-discover her warm elegance in a cold universe. Once you look past her mistakes and the silly bugs which make her quirky, she is a passionate lover to your space exploration imagination. She learns from you, gives you enough to satisfy your demands and at the same time, offers a unique gaming experience as she grows. The more you play with her, the better she becomes.			"

												Let me preface this by saying that yes, this game does run on a premium system, however the pricing is quite reasonable, and the game comes with a generous 3 months of full Premium time already paid up. (The best part about this is that the Premium time from buying on Steam isn't immediately applied to your account, you can activate it whenever you feel you're ready to start using Premium features). After that, Premium is priced on what features you want to use - managing colonies on planets in the Inner Systems, managing large-scale Industry, and taking part in combat are all counted separately, so if, like me, you plan on mostly running a manufacturing operation, you can pay just $1 a month and still enjoy what the game's got to offer for you. Personally speaking, I'm planning on going the full $3 a month anyways, this developer can definitely use the support!As far as space games go, I've been looking for one that allows me to participate in trade and industry in a non-combative manner, and I've gotta say Ascent so far has pushed all of the right buttons! Think of a large galaxy and a player-run economy like in EVE Online, except entirely PVE, so there's no need to worry about more experienced players rolling by and ruining your fun.Quite the opposite, the community has been super helpful for me so far, and I've gotta say I appreciate that kind of spirit!The controls for flight are simple but not overly so - You can navigate between gates and stations using just the mouse, and flying your ship in combat uses the WASD keys to pretty solid effect.The mining in the game also feels just right - No sitting around like in EVE, and no chasing asteroid chunks like in Elite Dangerous, but you have to match the speed of the asteroid to get a good bead on it, and then use your mining laser to heat it up to just the right temperature to get the best yield out of it.I'm still just getting started with regards to building colonies and space stations in the game, but I really like what's been done so far! There are still some minor issues regarding framerate and loading screens, but the developers have been super active and engage the playerbase on a frequent basis, so I'd say even if you decide not to buy the game today, definitely keep a close eye on it!

If you can ignore the old style graphics (which won't be there forever) and the early version of the combat system (this is being worked on), the gameplay has enough going for it currently, to keep your attention for a long time.What sold me: 1. It is an MMO. (I really like those)2. Asteroids orbit celestial bodies (nerdgasms everywhere!)3. Mining Asteroids isn't actually dull (mind... blown)4. Seamlessly fly from space to a planet's surface.5. Colonize (and once it is in, Terraform) those planets.6. Friendly community!			"

												Although the developers seem to be very cool guys, the game itself is just not playable after a week or so of play.1) Economy and professions are not balanced,  as with so many of these space games. Within hours of playing you will be able to get the best ships and trade at 1000x profit margins, allowing you to make hundreds of millions of currency within minutes. This unfortunately reducing anything else in the game to a worthless activity.2) Exploration would be cool, but there was no carrot to be found in the vast unknown. Just naming star systems. Sure, you may find a better asteroid mining field, but going there and mining would only making a fraction of what you can make station trading one jump away.until they fix the economy, I can not recommend this title, even though I wanted to so very badly.Broken economy = no reason to play, no ship progression, as everything is just handed to you within hours... Think minecraft stuck in creative mode.			"

												After over 5000 hours playing, here is my review. I am in no way associated with the company that provides Ascent. I am just a long time player.What Ascent Is and Is NotAscent came on line mid 2013. Since then, there has been many changes and additions. With all those changes, there are still some things at the core of the game that can be highlighted.Ascent is:A sandbox. Similar to Lego, it gives the player pieces to create what each person imagines within the boundaries of the game environment. We are given set pieces and are allowed to put them together as we want. A MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) game. It allows players to interact, chat, trade, and cooperate in game play and on large projects such as jump gate building and terraforming worlds. At the core of the game is a place to cooperate. An environment with 270,000,000,000 stars, each explorable with an average of 10 planets/moons in each star system. It is an entire galaxy waiting to be discovered. Each system is procedurally created from random seeds. This means that each system can have a wide variety of differing features, planets, and resources from a base standard set of resources which are available in game. Some are quite common, while a few are quite rare, yet all have been found and can be available to any player within the game. A game with a very basic storyline. We are not forced within a story that limits the players to a defined outcome or role. We are free to create our own story and empire. The dynamics are very easy to work with and after a short time, each player soon becomes a tycoon or master of their realm. There is so much room to play, that one can create an empire and never bump into another player, or create their empire on well established systems and join in on the projects going on within the game. One can switch back and forth between the two easily if mood calls for a day alone, or a day of play and interactions with the community. A place for traders. Trade is another core part of the game. Players can trade with NPC Space Stations in the Inner9 systems, or player Stock Markets in the outer systems. Mining asteroids is also a way to get free resources and sell to players or SS Local Markets for high profit trading. A Relaxed Community. Because we are given tools of cooperation, not destruction, we are able to assist each other and coordinate our efforts for the good of humanity, not the destruction of it. We get to know each other and enjoy catching up and joking. While we take the game seriously, we can relax and enjoy interacting and relating to each other. The game has a light layer of politics with a few elected positions, so good relations are also a tool within game to further one’s political career. The game waits for the player and is designed for someone to either play heavily, or a few hours a week, if they choose. The few quests in game are more for a tutorial than for locked in play. One can start and stop them at any time and place. Once achieved, the quests are done and allows for a return to relaxed free play. One can even drop into and out of the quests and the storyline waits for the player to want to go to the next step in the quest. The community also puts a lot of time and effort into creating game support. The game wiki pages are supplied and run by the players along with multiple other support tools. While play style can be relaxed, one can do some serious number crunching and documenting. Again, the player gets to choose which way they want to play.A light PvE(Player versus Environment) game. There are Non Player Character (NPC) pirates that are limited to selected areas. These are the only things players can shoot and attack. They are only in designated areas, so one has to seek them out. This allows to player co choose if they want to fight, or just build your empire. It allows for the relaxed game play. Pirates can be engaged, or ignored. A player can choose to take out some pirates one day and ignore them the next. Not a finished game. The game is well developed, but not completed. With one developer and many pieces available, like Legos, it can be a never ending play, or one you build a few things, then grow tired. New pieces are added slowly at times and quickly other times. The simple things come fast, but the more complex parts of the game take much more development and come slower. Each piece gives multiple ways of using it, so one piece can just add a little, or change the entire game dynamic. We often do not know until exploring it for a while to see how it effects things. Again, part of the open play that some like, while others do not. Serious bugs are addressed and dealt with, but a few additions are still in process of completion and have small issues that are on the list to be fixed. These issues are not game breaking, but one does need to be patient as they are slowly woven into completed game design. While this can be frustrating to some, remembering that there are some interconnectivity of other features that are coming may be why it is left as is for the present. One developer has to choose what is critical to put time into. Sometimes that time is just running the business and design has to be put on the back burner for a bit. Looking back over the past 4 years, the speed of new game development and additions are quite impressive for one person to have achieved. There is plenty of content for the cost of the game. Not for everyone. Sandbox games are not for everyone. Some like the tight quests and goals set by a designer. Many enjoy the player to player conflicts. Others enjoy a harsh game environment they must struggle against. Ascent has none of these elements. Those seeking these things will not connect easily.Not a place for PvP (Player versus Player). It is a place that you can not loose what you have. No one can destroy something you have worked to build or create. The core of the game is construction, not destruction. One player can not negatively affect another player’s game in a major way. No one can own systems, planets, or asteroid fields. They are all open to everyone. While you can not be locked out of anything, you can also not lock out anyone else from anything except your own colonies and starbases. You control those areas and share the rest of the areas of play. If your goal is to cause grief to others, you will find you have little tools to do that. Ascent is not a place to go after others.No where close to finding Earth. The ultimate goal is to find our way back to Earth. There is so much room and game play left before we can get back to Earth. We are not even sure what is between us and Earth. We suspect some alien influence, but only one encounter of extraterrestrials while progressing through the Neptune Project quest has been revealed. Out fears are there is a large alien force that we much face as we get closer to Earth, but this is all speculation.Well worth the price. Along with the purchase of the game, the player gets 3 months of premium subscription. This is more than enough time to delve into and build a massive empire. If the player enjoys the community and game play, it is only $3 a month for premium access after the first 3 months. Ready for you. The game and welcoming community is always ready for many more new Pilot Citizens (PC). We need those who have the neural pathways (imaginary thing needed in game to use warp and hyperjump drives) which allow their imaginations to determine their game-play. Are you tired of the constant drama and conflict? Are you ready for a totally different way to play a MMO? Are you ready to join us as we work together continuing to expand humanity’s reach into the galaxy on our way home? If you have read this far, we think you may just be one of the ones we are looking for.			"

Early Access Review
								Game is Good for its current early access state. It combines an open universe, resource manangement, exploration, and a little combat. The free content in the game is limited though.    The universe is a PVE environment so there is no worry about end gamers getting board and one shotting the little newbe's, like happons in EVE online a good deal. The non-hostile world is very relaxing, you travel, mine astroids, manage your holdings, make money, spend more money, make upgrades with little to stress you out. You can do anything in game you want, although you really can't get away from mining, at least not until later in the game when you own a lot of production, and even then the late game is when mining is most productive. Making money can be be easy most of the time, you can take contracts to buy and sell goods, deliver people to other places, but mining tends to best for time verses money.  There are 2 main astroid belts in the core systems, the roid respawn rate is good but there is usually an over abundence of people in the belts competing for the good ones.  Its best to get out of the core systems to make mining less crowded, though early game your mining with suck too much to make the long hauls worth while. You will be able to buy plots of land on the core planets and set up resource gathering, each core planet supports a different resource type. These plots take a lot of time, money, resources, and planning to get set up. Its best to reseach this aspect of the game before blindly dropping buildings down. Same applys to your first space station, early game the only thing your spacestation dose i suck you dry of money and materials. One day mine will make things but for now i have spent a weekend marathon gathering what i need to make the 6 buildings its supports, it will likly be another week or so before it produces anything. The combat is clunky early game, later when you have access to turrets and broadsides it might be better but i am not there yet. There is only 1 location at this time where you can fight, and have to start missions to get the enemys to spawn. There are no hostile forces anywhere except that one system, and you cannot run into them accidentally. So thats nice in many ways, though i would not mind a couple of pirate systems where there is more combat to be had. The game is a grind, its take a good deal of time and resources to get anything done, but your ability to procure stuff tends to scale with you as you progress in the game. For example early game the idea of mining 1000 ore for a project is brutal but later in the game you can mine that and more off 1 astroid. The community does not seem overly large but is generally helpful. At this time there tends to be a good amount of ""help the new guys"" mentalitly out there, it's not uncommon for someone to sell you their ship cheaply when they get a new one. The market however is driven by the players and in the week i have been playing has been driving to rather insane levels. In the first few days of the game for me one of the ships i wanted was running around 100k, a good grind for my skill level and equipment. Now after only a week the average price for the same ship is hovering around 1mil. The ship is not worth half that but thats the nature of these games.  You have to be patient when buying and wait for good deals or just suck it up and pay ripeoff prices. Late game vehicles are a different story, the price tag can hit the billions mark but for the time and resources thay take its understandable.  You must watch ship your buying, there are real A-holes out there who can ripe you off, a ship must have every peice of equipment on it to leave space dock, (with the exception of weapons and hyperdrives). There are people out there who will look at the average price of the ships of that type and put one up for sale very cheaply, many people seeing the low cost buy it up quickly thinking they got a good deal. When you click on a ship in the galactic market watch out for a red warning at the bottom of the ship data, the warning will tell you and ship cannot fly becuase its missing a piece or peices of equipment. If it something like a mining laser or armor its no big deal and you can take those off your current ship. if the item is a ship teir specific item like a reactor the ship is junk. Most of the ships systems have to match the level of that ship, so you cannot take stuff form a smaller ship to put on it. At this time you cannot sell ships to the AI only to other players, so once you upgrade you leave your old ship where ever you picked up the new one at. There is not a way to bring all your ships to one location so a common tactic, once you have a space station running, is to part at your station, build a shuttle and take the shuttle to pick up your new baby.  There are a number of things that annoy new players, the tutorials can be a little vague and do not explain what to do clearly much of the time, those of us to game a lot get through them fine but many flood chat with the same questions over and over. You are frequently told to go to the Wiki or check online, i find both those lacking. Much of the time you will not find the information you need online or on the wiki.....(least not on google seachs anyway)(anyone know of a real seach engine so i can stop the google uselessness). The game is only arond $20, it also offers a subscription. If your going to play this game seriously your going to need to pay.  For Non-prem players you can own anyship you can buy or build, but are limited to Class 5 equipment (Equipment goes to class 12 i think). You can buy and use higher class equipment but it will only function as class 5. Mining at class 5 is good for early to mid game but for end game needs will not cut it. Your starbase is limited to 6 buildings without premium, once again good enough for early game but not acceptable for late game unless you like projects taking several real world months to complete. You cannot make colonies in the outer systems unless you have premium. So there is a lot of pay to get anywhere in this game.  At this time there are no micro transactions though, you can't buy ships, resourced and such with real money, all has to be aquired in-game with in-game money. I guess this game is larger an MMO of sorts. I like the game but have already started making spreadsheet and such to manage my small and pathentic empire, so yes the game is already becoming work. I have not decided if i want to pay the subscription or not and thus contiune playing. But at the point i am at in game the lack of premuim is not hurting me yet, one more ship upgrade and i will have to make the money decision though.			"

								I definitely recommend this.Plus points:AMAZING community. Extremely helpful and kind.Wide variety of ships.Effort is awarded. Nothing here is p2w.Billions of planets yet to be discovered!It's worth the 20 bucks/euro/whatever. Believe me.If you ignore the fact that the graphics are somewhat dated, you have an AMAZING space MMO to explore.There is lots going for it, even in Early access. And there's plenty features that are yet to be implemented.			"

								Firstly, ignore the hours on record; I have invested a lot more hours in this than is shown here, however a lot of other players in the community has spent countless more than me :)Ascent is a genuine space-based sandbox where depth triumphs over flashy graphics and CGI and actually provides you with a genuine sanbox experience where you have the freedom to go anywhere and do whatever you want. Outside of the initial tutorial (Which covers all the basics of the game), nothing is necessary to complete to progress in the game how you want (Even the story missions are optional). Do you want to make your fortune by travelling to distance systems and mining rich resources? Or, would you rather spend time jumping to systems 100's of light years out from the inner 9 systems and discovering what new worlds the procedural generated engine generates (Which can be marvels to behold, including purple methane oceans)? Or, take on the pirates of the universe and help clean-up the troubles in Janus-A on behalf of the UAE? Or, buy up all the resources available and become an industrial manufacturing mogul? Or, colonise remote systems and begin harvesting raw materials to sell back to other players?On top of the sandbox approach to this game, the other main strength is how the player base has shaped and expanded on the game. Not only is the economy in the game driven by the players (Pro tip: sell all mined Niobium and Tin to players and not NPC's), the players are also deriving their own content and expanding the known galaxy beyond the inner 9 star systems. From building remote colonies and star bases through to jump-gates to remote systems to connect remote colonies to the inner 9 without the need to use a hyperdrive, the player base and its strength will be what keeps the content generation going for a long time to come. Also, there is a democracy at play where players have the ability to vote for their president, as well as senators of star systems, governors of planets and even mayors of colonies. Lastly, a lot of the content in the game doesn't require you to be online to achieve. For example, colony builds will occur within a period of 24 hours (Usually), which happens even if you are offline. This also applies to any manufacturing or production you currently have at your colonies or star bases. This means that if you ever take a break for a couple of days, or have limited time to play, everything you have will keep manufacturing/producing without you.Ascent already has a lot of content to keep casual and hardcore players alike interested for a long time and with the up-and-coming features (Such as PvP and larger ships) it will only get bigger and better over time. Well worth the small monthly fee + initial purchase price.			"

Early Access Review
								October 16 2016:So the game has been fully released, there's been constant updates, new ships added, Terraforming has now been added, combat reworks among other things.   I still definitely recommend this game, yes it still does have a premium membership, but it's approximately $ a month for being able to use larger than class 5 mining beams, etc etc.  you can still play the game without the premium.  October 26 2015:===================================================================In regards to the Pay-to-win comments such as:===================================================================""Pay To WinThe kickstarter crowd got a free ship called a “bowhead”. Biggest and best ship in the game, nothing even comes close. The kickstarter players that have a bowhead basically played the game in EZ mode. They didn’t have to worry about cargo spaces on starter ships, the skipped it. This provided the kickstarter crowd with a massive, and in my opinion, game-breaking advantage.One of the kickstarter “options” also provided a planet terraformer, once again something that only the kickstarter crowd got.Those who paid the developer got a massive game advantage. This is a gamebreaking advantage due to the fact that a ship's cargo space determines how much money can be made ... and how much fuel the ship can carry to jump to and explore other systems.""===================================================================My Response:===================================================================For starters when the kickstarter crowd got their bowheads, there still weren't Hyperdrives for it (had to be researched up to get towards them), there weren't massive colonies supplying every resource you could possibly think of, so asteroids had to be mined for all the resources that were needed for mass colony production.   In regards to the terraforming devices, they are in no way pay to win, as anyone can use those planets for their own colonies.  Terraforming devices gave us ALL the ability to have colonies without the need of environmental domes all over.===================================================================--New Thoughts--===================================================================I've got almost 1200 hours into this game, and I feel that that numbers only going to go higher and higher.  I have over 300 titles on steam, and this is the first game I've actually broken 1000 hours on.  There have been many improvements to this game such as updated effects in colony construction that make it easier to track the buildings you are placing.  An updated chat system has been added that allow the creation of our own channels, as well as a help, a trade, and a global channel.  Smuggling has been implemented which can be quite fun, but is only meaningful for newer players at the moment.  Co-op combat and the combat rework will be coming soon.Economy Balance has been brought into the game through an elected President roll allowing the modification of what colonies will purchase minerals at, approving gates to the inner 9 systems etc. A few people have put negative reviews up here because of the nerf to carbon hauling.  We used to be able to print billions of credits for almost no effort hauling carbon to the inner systems.  Several people invested their colonies entirely into carbon, and because of the nerf to prices they rage quit, caused a lot of drama and put out some negative reviews.   They aren't wrong on all of their points, but they're coming from a perspective of upset and disheartenment.Still one of the best communities out of any online game.  Entire community spirit of the game is based on cooperation, so if that's what you're looking for, this is where it is. ===================================================================--Original Review--===================================================================This game is a lot of fun.The game is still in Alpha stage at the moment, and while there are a lot of needed QoL updates, the basic, and even a lot of the more advanced gameplay features are functioning as they should.This game is very different than most other MMOs.   The pace isn't fast, you don't rush for anything, you can try, but it's still going to take time to learn the game, to progress through research, and to learn more as you go.   A little bit complicated to figure out at first, but once you do figure it out it's easy to learn more.The community in this game is extremely helpful, and mature.  The developer is Dedicated, and has a good idea where he's going with the game.    after 500 hours in I'm still enjoying nearly everything to the game.If you would like a headstart I highly recommend watching some of the tutorials made by Waervyn.  They are highly understandable and explain things in much greater detail.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa53kfJdPTHCnVW7jAsLARIF1mVWwWxsxMining is a lot of fun, there's no AFKing to it, and there's no scooping stupid rocks each time.Trading is very profitable and fun once you've got the cargo space to make it worth your time.Combat is not quite done as of yet, but is the next priority on the developer's plan.  He has huge visions for where he wants to take this game, and it's going to be awesome to see what he does with combat.Exploration is incredibly fun.  From Extrememly rare Neutron stars to Blackholes to regular K type stars you can find it all.  Earth Like planets are rumored to exist but are insanely rare, the nebulae in systems are quite beautiful, and the planet procedural generation is really something to look at. Colony management has received updates now that make it so much easier to start building your colonies YAY :).  The Dev is currently seeking a UI Programmer for , but the mechanics are very functional.  Very interesting game system different from pretty much any other game I can think of.  Sort of a Mix of Eve Online's Planetary Interaction, and X series Station building is the best way I can describe it.All in All worth every Penny.			"

While this game is still early access and therfor has its fair share of bugs, it is nothing that impeads the game as a whole.  I encurage all fans of space combat and or trade from the most competitive of player to the most casual of player and everybody inbetween to get this game.			"

												Once I got past the game's rocky start, I've found that, thus far, this is the best ""free to play"" I have ever played. There is stuff you can buy, but the top tier stuff you have to get by earning it...or building it yourself. Meanwhile, as a free player, there's a lot you have to do: mining, settlement building, space station building, wreck salvaging, trading, and so on. My best advice is use the help function (the question mark at the top middle-left of your screen), the wiki, and the help chat and you will muddle through to competence in the various endeavors in about 8 to 10 hours.One thing I really appreciate (and the gankers from Eve looking for fresh blood hate) is that there is no PvP, at least not yet, and the PvE is optional. You are free to mine and build and colonize in relative peace. If you're a builder / logistician tired of having the apple cart kicked over by a 12 year old who hijacked daddy's credit card and bought themselves a ride, welcome to Ascent.			"

								Amazing game. EvE feel with Freelancer learning curve all in a PvE environment. Plenty to do, great community, stable, and lots to come. Spent more money on a pizza and this will last much longer. Always wanted to play a game that has the whole package. Planet interation (land, walk around, sample the soil to see if you want to colonize it), fly to billions of star systems. Asteroid mining & gas collection is actually fun. Plenty of Combat mission to progress through. Set up planetary mining & farming systems, analyze wrecks, trade goods, explore, craft, manufacture, work with the community to build new warp gates & more. You actually help build the game. Hard to get any sleep...			"

								The premise of the game is excellent, and with additional work on graphics, a better tutorial, contract management it could be a great game. The UI is poor, some of the text boxes have a black background so you can read them, and the rest have transparent backgrounds making them almost impossible to read at some of the space stations - especially if another ship happens to be docked in that view area. You can get as many contracts as you want, but some mysteriously disappear in transit. I have been using a spreadsheet that has the various resources and specials listed in the rows and the stations listed for the columns. Each can show 9 contracts, who supplies what, and shows passengers and packages. At every station that I dock at, I go through the scrolling window and verify which contracts were fullfilled or just disappeared so I know exactly how much I need to get and deliver. For instance I know Elysium is the supplier of Titanium, and on my spreadsheet I see that I have a contract to deliver 56 units to Orion, three contracts with Mica (52, 44, and 34 units) and 34 units to Solaris. I have color coded the space stations so I know which warplines they are on. So I know I have to jump to Mica first, in order to continue down that warpline to Solaris.I have been able to upgrade ships quickly, so I am in a class 5 now and almost ready to buy a class 6. Unfortunately, I am not able to hire a pilot to run the old ships even though in the manage ship section there are text buttons for pilot and crew. You can sell your old ships on the galactic market, but you can not get back to your listed ship to change price or take it off the market. I have never received a notification of a listed ship being sold so there could be my class 1, 2, 3, and 4 ships still up for sale.A recent update gave us the option of turning off the white screen that shows during a warp. Unfortunately, we do not have any control over the rest of the psychedelic warp screens which show for way too long. There are no controls to set up a transit route or a trade route. If I had 58 iron, 42 grain, and 60 fruit in the hold and I am going from Andromeda to Plato to deliver the iron contract, then to Archon for the grain delivery, and finally to Solaris to deliver the fruit I have to manually select each warp gate and each station. So it would 12 warp segments to accomplish those deliveries. Each individual segment has to be done separately after sitting through another long viewing of the same psychedelic warp scene. Even cheap GPS units today allow you to do a trip plan with intermediate stops. Surely a civilization that has the technology to build warp gates and space stations could concieve of a better trip planner.At some warp gates a fuzzy red blob will come flying at you then execute a 90 degree turn and fly off into the heavens. Since the ship or shields have never been damaged, I have to assume that it is not someone attacking me. I have bought blueprints for each of the bays in the private space station and for a farm on the surface of Ceres. Building will not commence though until you deliver all of the raw materials needed for each section. I have tried to deliver the farm robots and some material to the surface, but could not offload anything. I ended up stuffing everything in the hanger with the hope that it will become clearer with more gameplay on how to actually initiate building and delivering of goods.It is in early release and the developers are steadily working on the bugs and player feedback so I am hopeful that the UI, trip planning, building, and overall look and feel will steadily improve. Right now it is just rote grinding, upgrading ships, and slowly assembling the parts to have a private space station and surface farm.			"

								This week marks my first month in Ascent, The Space Game. What a ride! First off, everyone has a different reason for playing these types of games, and for the most part this game should satisfy an itch whether it's in trading, crafting/production, economies, exploring, discoveries, colony building, and much more.  The emphasis is PVE, but there will be a PvP component in the future.  But I really want to discuss my play this past month.I am one of those guys that enjoy the journey, rather then the destination.  And this game hits my spot.  Yes, the beginning is tough when you start on a small ship and 1,000 credits and you hear people on chat talking about millions and billions of credits.  But I decided at the very start that I would invest on a foundation to support future play.  I did the early quests, and settled on the inner 8 planets.  As I did this I slowly raised my ship level.  In my style of play I did not use chat to beg and cajole people to give me ships or money to move along quickly.  I had watched Sinstrite's videos before playing and then looked a little at the wiki, so I had an idea what to expect.  After my 8 settlements I built my ISB (Inner Starbase).  It has 100 rings but I found that I only needed 60 or so to be productive.  I scanned dozens and dozens of wrecks and claimed many blueprint fragments for higher level ships.  So where am I today?  I am still in a Mammoth, and not a Seraph, which is a much bigger ship, but I am fine with that.  Amazingly, I have already built 5 Mammoths in my shipyard which I sell to other players.  I have built my first colony and outside starbase (OSB) so now I have two shipyards working, increasing my production effort.  My colony is growing, and I am looking through the 100 new systems I discovered myself to find a suitable second colony.The game keeps going.  It is what you make of it.  The people in the game are extremely helpful.  Hey, if you want someone to give you a leg up with a better ship and credits you could probably fine someone, and there is nothing wrong with that.  This game has something for everyone. This economy is player driver for the most part.  I heartily recommend this game.  If you see me, wabasco, in game.. give a shout!			"

												Very fun concept, but crashes *CONSTANTLY*. Monthly subscription system is a major turnoff, too. Comes with a few months by default, which is nice, but there's a huge wall of grinding between you and getting to a lot of the features the game is advertised for. I have over a dozen hours and I'm still literally just grinding cash, trying to get a spaceship capable of going exploring out into the systems outside of the base 9. Most of this grinding is done by clicking autopilot buttons. Settlement and star base construction system has absurdly dumb crafting times (time per module is measured in a number of real time hours, often numbering above twenty - freaking - hours!). Number of colonies and star bases you can have is based on how much real money you spend per month - you can go and buy bigger subscriptions to get more planets. Your control over the planets you colonized is based on how many people have built colonies there and how willing you are to involve yourself in the politics process. As in, in-game elections and such. Which is an interesting concept, but I hesitate to see it in practice as it strikes me as a potentially nasty means of griefing. Combat is *extremely* clunky and awkward, and the radar system is in desperate need of a revamp. Indicators are small and difficult to make out unless you expand the radar, which makes it difficult to aim your frontal guns, which are fixed with your movement. There are broadside and 90 degree cone turrets, but those are totally automated and have no player input beyond placing them on your ship. As far as I can tell, there are no variety in weapons, and combat is restricted to one zone. All in all, this game strikes me as something I would expect to see out of an alpha. The graphics are rather weak compared to performance (I have a Radeon r9 380, 8 core AMD processor, and 16 gb ram, and my FPS on the second worst setting ranges between 60 to 30 in normal play, but the game's actual material in peak settings is on par with something that's like, ten years old?), it crashes pretty much once per hour. Sometimes those crashes are severe enough to require a hard restart of my PC -- I checked on the forums and this isn't an isolated incident, either, and has happened to people on a wide range of systems - on high end to low end computers. Combined with the massive grind wall to get access to the content with even a shred of depth, and this game was a huge let down for me. I *really* wanted to like this game, but *DO NOT* let the trailer fool you. It is *not* what it's advertised as.			"

Early Access Review
								ConsThe game is limited in functionality due to ""Premium"" accounts.It requires you to send the developer a paypal transaction of 3$ to get full access to the game, per month. (This isn't listed on the steam page, I previously stated $8, however the store page is unclear in game)You can warp/fly through planets and stars, ships and asteroids, if they're in your way.Bugs galore. You may constantly need to restart the game while docked for it to see what items you have in your hull, or to fulfill a quest.No jettising of un-needed items. See below, dev response. No idea how to do it.You must dock some where and drop off or sell everything you pick up. With this mechanic, everything left at a star port or base or whatever its called, you have to go back there to pick it up. There is no global inventory system. (This is good because each ship has a limited hull, just creates a headache.)Controls are a disaster.Graphics are horrible.Pretty much every quest is a ""fetch"" quest. While you may not have to do these to gain money, it would be nice to have something a little more... in depth.This started off as a web browser game.... While not directly a flaw, it's still relevant. (Rust was originally a web based game too)This is the poor man's care bear version of Elite Dangerous, or Star Citizen.The combat system is interesting, but boring. Most times your just holding mouse 1 and aiming at the AI bad guys. There's little you can do to evade or out smart the AI. Their hits are pretty much direct, and its a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥contest of who has a bigger ship.The only ""complex"" part of this game is working around the bugs and controls. Depth.. I guess that's subjective. Rich get richer seems pretty much how this game will end with hardly any room for new people if this game expands any further.ProsYou can warp everywhere pretty much. Not too much manual boring flying.Everything is easy to earn given some time.Me and the first few main characters I came in contact with share the same last name. My ancestors control the galaxy.

Early Access Review
 Disclaimer - I have been gifted a free key for this game for review purposes, however my review will be kept as truthful as possible, since I am meant to help developers and buyers/gamers. Ascent - The Space Game Review Overview First of all, this game is not suited for every single age group. If you were born in the 80's or 90's, they you should probably like it due to the nostalgia level graphics of a AAA game made in that time period. Also, for fans of outer space, space ships, mining ,farming, ect, then this game is going to be a great idea to buy during a sale.You can: farm, sell items, buy items, mine, get destoryed by Enemies, get more ships, upgrade your ship/s in many ways, destroy enemies, explore 270,000,000,000 (270 billion) star systems worth of:  exploration, colonization, starbase construction, research and technology, mining and farming, trading and combat.  Also, outside the first sector, everything in game is made by real players. There's some spects of 'City simulation' involved, but I didn't discover completely yet. The game is so much cheaper than EVE or Elite: Dangerous, while it also having some fast developement speed, awesome and trutworthy community plus many of hundreds of hours making the game play for you, make it what you want! If you want a City simulator, then so be it. Like mining? Do that then.  Gameplay Oh boy, where to start. The tutorial is a bit floaty and hard, especially the part  where you need to fight a weak drone. You spend ages just aiming at it since the ship is so light and moves so fast while also sliding too far. Then, once it is in sight, you can spend ages shooting at it, after quite literally 30-90 minutes, you have finished the drone part, which is where I quit the tutorial and went onto the game itself. After the tutorial is done, spend a lot of time finding the icon for the Autopliot (which is transparent until you hover above it), and then spending around 10 minsutes doing the firs fex missions. Then the real fun part is trying to find out what to do on your own. Farming? No, can't conolize a planet yet. Destroy ships? Nah, can't find any. Destroy Asteroid and meteorites? Yes, then sell it all for cash. After the first 60 mins of gaming, you should have around 10K cash, which you can do quite a lot with. Graphics The graphics might not look like much, but they are still quite pretty, also, it keeps the loading times less than 5 seconds! So that right there is a giant point to the finalized score. Anyway, moving on. The graphics are what you would expect from an Early Access game midway-nearly finished developement. Anyway, these are still some pretty graphics and are satisfactory for my needs and, hopefully, the majourity of the audience can agree with me on this topic. Current Content This is where beauty truly met the eye. As I already said in the overview and gameplay topics, this game has some of the .ost in-depth systems ever to be in a video game. So think of EVE + Elite Dangerous, a game based around space and becoming a high rank withing the community by upgrading ships, colonizing your soon-to-be empire and so, so much more to come. The developers are awesome, they listen to feedback, do Kickstarters to help out with lots of different subjects (one of the most recent one was for the games graphic improvements), but, in my opinion, the HuD is very ugly. the Chat has its own HuD, most things do, but it's a try-hard at doing a futuristic orange 6th grade art project Pros and Cons Pros:Graphics are quite prettySo much actions waiting to be completedQuests that aren't all terribleYou need to put loads of work into getting enough money to buy something, which then is so rewardingVery cheap for it's content countTrustworthy communityMiningFarmingCity simulation propertiesResearchMore things like the ones above270Billion + star systemsSome very far explorationTons of shipos, upgrades ect (lots of customization)Tutorial that is informative and has a funny teacher (Dave the computer)DialougeYou don't need Premium for most things, if not, allAn extremely promising Early Access gameCons:The combat objective in the Tutorial is quite hard Final scores Gameplay - 8.5/10Graphics - 6.5/10Content - 8/10Final score (Metascore, if you will) 77/100If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

Early Access Review
								Do I like this game, yes. Why? Read all the positive reviews, the points are thorough.  Ones I didn't see listed are it's procedurally generated. Complex trading system but not overly complicated.  I like to play the market, so with hyperdrives (being able to jump to systems as long as you have hydrogen, which is fuel for hyperdrive) and you can find lucrative trade routes.Do I recommend this game, yes.  Why? The community is full of helpful people.  This is probably the most helpful and friendly community that I've seen in a very long time.  With so many toxic communities / forums out there, this one is a breathe of fresh air.  People actually work together.Would I buy it again, yes.  Why?  While I want to get the name out there and support the dev (Jam) for such a great vision in what I'm looking for, some people are on a budget and I do believe the web client you can get completely free and play in a browser.  You can use up to class 5 ship modules on a free account (non-premium, which is the cheapest I've seen in any game, it's like 3 bucks a month or something) and you can only build in the inner planets which number to about 8 I think ( the warp gate linked planets, outer systems is a reference to everything outside the inner systems)Major things to point out that sold me on this game not listed above:-The dev Jam interacts with the community on a daily basis, he listens, looks at the bug reports, hotfixes these bugs he's made aware of on a daily basis as he can get to them, and he keeps the community updated.  This guy is very transparent about what he's doing / trying to do.-Sinstrite made a youtube series on this game which also helped sell me.  His youtube channel is here: https://www.youtube.com/user/Sinstrite and I recommend starting with episode one.  I personally watched and enjoyed them all before buying.  If you're  only going to watch one vid, I recommend the develepor (dev) interview.-When you buy this game off Steam (currently 17ish bucks) and first load into the game, you will show up as newuser#.  You will need to register to setup your in-game handle.  You can find this at the top in game, under options > register.  Now if you buy through Steam, you have 3 months premium when you want to use it.  I recommend learning the game / get as far as you feel is right for you before activating premium as this extends your time in a way and is simply not needed.  Now if you get to the bigger ships and want to get into mining mainly then I recommend the best mining laser you can get as the class modules are basically multipliers.  Just ask questions / watch vids / use the wiki (in-game help "" H "" links to the wiki) the wiki is located here: http://wiki.thespacegame.com/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page-The game forums are here: http://forum.thespacegame.com/-Once you decide to claim your Steam 3 months premium I recommend, setting your Steam account to public (just change it back after registering), Having the Steam overlay on (It's on by default unless you tell it to be off by default).-I go by the $1 per hour price when gauging if a game is worth it or not, entertainment wise.  I payed 17 bucks since it's on  sale on Steam, and I have 40 hours at the time of this writing.  So according to my gorilla math, it's well worth it.-I highly recommend using the wiki and asking questions in game.  The community is fantastic and helpful, this alone makes the game worth it imo.-There's many other things not listed such as programmable command in the ship computer that let you do many, many things, the most common is ejecting unwanted cargo.  You can bind all these commands using alias.  Think Valve games where you can bind keys using alias's.  It's very helpful and complex, again all this stuff is on the wiki.  There's way too many to list.-This is obvious but needs to be said.  This game is Early Access.  There will be bugs.  This is run by a one man dev team and he busts his backside trying to further this game.  There's new stuff added / fixed daily and the beauty of it the server usualy isn't taken down to do these, it's just there, you download  the updates.  You should know it's  EA by the huge blue text and Early Access sub game list it's under and that means it's not release, so before you go buying into what the four negative reviews compared to the 40ish+ positive ones, look at what they are saying and think about what EA is before taken them to heart.-The mining system is the most fun in any space game I've played.  You have to interact / pay attention while mining, It's skill based meaning you have to get between a certain temperature range which determines how much ore you get, and it you do too little or too much temperature then you get nothing (too little and you just have to do it again, too much heat and the asteroid is vaporized).  Asteroids can grow in size / yield the longer they aren't mined.  This system encourages exploration in finding lucrative asteroid fields once you get a hyperdrive.  It's a very unique and welcomed way to mine.All in all this game is fun so far and I'm enjoying the ride / community.  As always I recommend watching youtube /  twitch vids before  making a decision, and hopefully you'll come to the same conclusion I did and pick up the game.  See you in game!			"

Early Access Review
								Great game.  Of course it is still growing as it is in early access but I only see things going more positive as development progresses.  It's not the prettiest game out there (looking at you ED) but it does have a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of things to do (looking at you again ED).  EVE isn't my thing for most of the various reasons you hear other people saying EVE isn't their thing so I don't see a need to write out why it isn't for me.  I love trading and building and having a sense of progression with my ship/company/player or whatever instead of just trying to get more credits (ED).  I find myself invested and interested in my space station and my land farms/mines.  Ascent is a game you can pick up and play without learning a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of stuff (besides the computer console, which I believe after some usage it isn't that hard).  If you like space games and are willing to accept the fact this is early access and major things are still getting fleshed out (even though it is 100% playable for me right now without even noticing it is early access) then I would say check this game out.

								I've been waiting for a game like this for a long time.  That time has come and I'm not disappointed.  This is a community-focused game with a real economy the size of which far exceeds ANYTHING in a non-subscription based MMO.  The scale of this game is phenomenal while the controls are wonderfully simple.  The game seems more economy based than combat based but there are combat vessels and weapons and all that.  Two things I wish were in the game but aren't are PvP and ship design, but who gives a ♥♥♥♥?  We have newtonian physics and 270 BILLION STAR SYSTEMS!  There are a few core systems which you start off in, and these are connected by jump gates.  All the other systems require a jump drive to get to.  What is so very cool is that groups of incredibly industrious players have started building new gates to connect the first few colonised systems to the core systems.  Currently the game feels as though something special is occuring - this is a great moment to jump in and be part of something which is going to be very special indeed ;)			"

								Ascent:TSG is the game I have been looking for.Good Community that is very helpful.Lots to do. - Asteroid Mining - Building Settlements on the 9 core planets, (need Premium to build more than the first 2)- Build your own Starbase so you can Research (real time based), Build module to make parts need to build Weapons, Ships additional modules and much more.- (Premium) Explore Solar System (270 Billion of them) and Claim them as your own using a Hyperdrive.- Build Jump Gates (later in the game) so you do not have to use a Hyperdrive.AND much much more with more to come.There are bugs - BUT - which game doesn't, and the Dev works on fixing them, BUT, more importantly listen to the players.There is MORE content in the works down the road - AND - there is no charge for it.Con (for some)There are 3 $1 (US) premiums you need to pay per month to - Fly ships and use ship modules higher than Class 5.- Build all of the 9 Settlements (first two are free)- Make Claims on planets so you can build Colonies. (you get 100 Stellar Credits per month per premium - total 300 Stellar Credits per month)$3 (US) a month is not much - Considering what I had to pay each month to play Eve-Online and many other games.(I almost feel as if I were taking advantage of the developer considering the Depth and Feel of the game)			"

								As a general rule I am very wary of Early Access games after being burned more than a few times but what sold me on trying this one is that in addition to being on sale right away they give you 3 months of $3 per month premium access. That to me is showing confidence in your game now and where you think it will be in 3 months. I have not played very long yet but the bones of an excellent game appear to be there right from the start.			"

Early Access Review
								Ascent - The Space Game is a PvE ""sandbox"" MMOG which features you in a spaceship so you can mine or fight your way to economic prosperity and the ability to colonize planets anywhere in the galaxy. For the TL;DR set, some brief highlights, both positive and negative. I've deliberately not attached these labels to these highlights so -you- can decide for yourself what they are. The galaxy is huge!  It is repeatedly asserted that it would take years to explore the entire galaxy. If you discover one of the billions of star systems out there, it gets named after you. Note that anyone can do this in a matter of days; I saw a fairly new player discover a star system just yesterday.  Deep space exploration requires a hyperdrive matched to your ship and fuel; you can skim gas giants to get this fuel.  The colonization mechanics look extremely interesting. You really do have to take scientific measurments on a planet and determine if it's worth colonizing. Once you colonize, you actually have to do some engineering (making breathable atmosphere, dealing with gravity and air pressure, etc).  Before colonization happens, you almost certainly will build settlments (planetary mining and food production) and a starbase (research, certain factories, ship construction, ship modules). These can be done much faster and from day one. They still require resources to build, just not as much.  It's somewhat repetitive (grindy) to make money. Once you ""tier up"" and build some settlements, it does get faster. Planetary colonization should be considered a top tier financial effort.  Blueprint research is ""gated"" and takes quite a long time, forcing purchases from older players to get started (unless you want to wait over two months).  For those that like community, you can decide to build a jump gate in your sector. Building jump gates requires a massive resource effort from multiple players to complete.  This game is developed by -one- guy. While this is impressive, it does mean updates may not be as fast as most gamers demand them. Overall I recommend this game because I like it.  However, this game may not be for everyone, and I encourage you to read on past the TL;DR point to understand my perspective better.TL:DR pointI've been playing a short time (46 hours over two weeks) and wanted to start a review before the repetitive nature of what I'm doing casts the game in a more negative light than I'd like.  So this is more of a stream of consciousness description for those that want more information or to see where I'm coming from. Note well that I'm not a veteran player, and that my perspective will more closely match a new player's perspective...I feel this kind of perspective is more valuable because a veteran has usually overlooked things that are annoyances and/or game-breakers to most people. These issues obviously don't game break for the vets since....they are still playingMy draw to this game is this: I've learned there is a set of what look like awesome colonization mechanics that appear to make it worth grinding to get to. In studying these mechanics, it seems there's a lot of interesting engineering to be done just to find a spot to colonizxe, let alone manage and maintain your colonies. It seems you have to build and manage environmental domes (unless the atmosphere is perfect) and supply them with the atmospheric gases you need to maintain a habitable environment for your colonists. You have to do this before you can get to any of the good stuff (e.g. growing food, mining resources) that a colony will help you with. The caveat here is that I can't do any of this neat gameplay yet. I need to make at least a billion or two before I can afford it, plus I need to research a few key factory blueprints and get more settlements up producing goods. This brings me to my pet peeve of this game...Research.Researching anything: 24 hours. Increasing the level of something: level * 24 hours. (""Class"" is a synonym for ""level"" in this game). Class 12 gear is what you'll need for the top tier ship that you can get. It will take you over two months (78 days) just to research ONE key ship module to that level. Examples of key modules: weapons, hyperdrives, mining beams, and ram scoops. This means I'm mostly forced to buy these modules from players if I want to make faster progress. (You can argue that I could spend the better part of the year just logging in long enough to cycle my research to the next class. That's ludicrious to me, but technically true.)This is not game breaking for me, but see above...I have a draw that I want to explore. There have been a couple of discussions in chat about this issue where frustration was expressed and I'm sure new players will find this frustrating. Be ye warned if you want to play. I still think it's worth it, but that's me. If you are going to research, you'll want to build your starbase quickly. This is going to require cash for blueprints (available via the contracts board) and resources (available from space stations and players). If you want a steady stream of resources (income), you can start building settlements. Settlements, set up correctly, allow one a certain amount of resource income per day. Both settlements and starbases take a bit of work to setup; it's going to take many trips for you if your ship's cargo hold is small. I waited until I had a big enough ship. Yes, there's repetitive content. Making money for me was initially about buying low to fill my cargo holds and selling high between space stations, easily reached by the autopilot menu.  Once I had enough money, I could buy the next tier of ship which holds more cargo. This allowed me to make money even faster. If you are new, please discover the ""stock market search"" in the map screen; this will allow you to find places to buy trade goods even cheaper. At some point, for me this was when I was flying a class 6 ship, trading becomes less lucrative than mining asteroids. I was able to get a relatively inexpensive class 5 mining beam and suddenly I was swimming in lucrative resources. I was able to use contracts (available at space stations) and the previously mentioned stock market search to turn the resources into credits.  So...at the moment, when I want more cash, I go farm asteroids. Repeatedly. I do vary where I do this, and because my cargo hold isn't uber huge (I'm in a hammer atm) I do have to break and go drop off/sell my cargo. It's not bad at all for me, and I -am- what people call ""ADD"" so I do need lots of stimulus to not be bored.  But this is me. So, if you like space games, resource factories, economics, and science...this game is definately for you. I may revisit this review after I've been playing a lot longer.   "

Early Access Review
								I've played this game 4 days now.  And the clock says I've got 48 hrs in.  That's with logging in to play, exiting when I am not playing.  Needless to say, this game has grabbed my interest in a way that other games haven't.  The last game I got this interested in was WoW back in 2005.This game is a space exploration, mining, building, crafting, MMORPG.  There is a Galactic Market (auction) that you can put your crafted or used items on.  There are contracts from NPCs you can run to get credits.  There is limited PVE but no PVP (yet).It has a rapidly expanding community, as it was *just* released on Steam EA a few days ago.  There are a few die hard Kickstarter supporters that are firmly entrenched and know everything, a few middle of the roaders, and a bunch of noobs fast gaining experience.  The community is typically friendly and helpful.  They never seem to tire of answering the same questions over and over from the newest noobies.  They are charitable with advice, and occasionally ship upgrades.  The game developer actually logs in and chats with players fairly often, answering questions and generally being friendly.  One concern I always have coming into a game where some have been playing it for a while is that they tend to stake out their claims to the best of whatever resources you can find.  They have the best gear, and I hate playing catch up ball.  However, this game has 270 billion (with a b) explorable star systems.  Everyone can name a system after themselves, and colonize a planet.  And everyone else can come visit.  And as to gearing up, it happens quickly.  You progress from a tiny ship to a humongous ship in your first few days.  There are more things to aspire to (ie bigger ships yet, starbases, colonies, star systems named after you), so there is always room to grow.The pros of this game are it is fun, has a great community, a lot to do, and loads of potential.  The cons are a somewhat clunky interface (sorry Jam!), and that it is still a work in progress.  But it is a fun, playable, very social work in progress.This game is well worth getting.  If you have read this far, you are wasting time; go get it and get exploring!  I would gladly recommend this game.			"

								Ascent is a truly wonderful game, offering the most pure fun I’ve had with any game in a very long time. I enjoy building slowly to develop self-sufficiency, but, in the four months I’ve played, I have been the recipient of much kind advice and an occasional helping hand. I have to echo what so many others have said, this game has a great, caring community.Jam is an incredibly talented developer. I am grateful that he has kept true to his own vision which, I think, has produced the coherence and scale we see already in this relatively early stage of the game. Yet he is very responsive to player experience and ideas. That makes it much easier to be patient when glitches arise, as they must, during the development process. We know Jam will address them.As to gameplay, I am able to immerse myself in the game’s premise, that we are struggling to recover and rebuild the high civilization we’ve lost. As a number of other players have done, I have developed my own tools, primarily spreadsheets, catalogs and calculators, to record my own exploration and production data. What has been for some an inconvenience has been for others an element of realism.At the same time, I am able to engage the community’s meta-game, expressed on the forum and wiki, in the lively chat flow, and now, perhaps, here in the Steam forum.Finally, Ascent is the kind of game that allows me to step back when RL demands. When I return, I’ve suffered no loss.  Jam has added new features. My colonies have kept producing. My fellow players have devised new plans and projects, all of which enhance my game.It’s just pure fun. "

Early Access Review
								May 9th 2015 still zero info about the fact that you will pay a subscription fee for this game after 3 months on the store page, even though hundreds have written complaints regarding that specifically. This game still is not worth buying just for thier lack of transparency alone.Strike one: I buy the game and then find out there is a premium service for a monthly service charge. The store page is incredibly misleading. The subscription (which is mandatory btw if you REALLY want to play the game) is not mentioned on the store page in the same way and same place as other games with subscriptions. The subscription is very cheap, about 2 cups of coffee a month, but the sneakiness just gives you a bad taste.Strike two: I play the game and am confronted with not just horrible graphics but horrible UI. Ok I understand this is early access but the game is soo ugly it really kind of hurts to look at it. We are talking year 2000 graphics here. But hats not all, the ships are copies from other games, least they sure look like clones. The space stations are an eyesore, not the graphics but the design. The area where you dock small ships pretty much looks like it was a complete after thought. It sticks out of the stations like  an oversized mole on a midgets face, not just no orginality, but zero and i mean zero aesthetics.Strike three: Ok forget the graphics, the UI, the sneaky little subscription charge (which is cheap) they had to get something right, right?  For me im thinking/hoping that at least the ships fly right. NOPE!  They fly like a turd. Absolutely zero feeling of flight, just feels like crap is moving on your screen. The flight controls are horrendous and not just talking about the default assignments which you can change well some of the controls you can change(sadly not the ones you want). Couldn't even remap the controls for left and right wing dip (they call it spin +/-) to my saitek x52 joystick rotation because they apparently didnt think you would want to use your joystick for something like that. Over all you end up not wanting to fly and this is a space game! Thats like microsofts flight simulator being so horrible you dont want to fly I mean come on! So I ended up just doing the tutorial and clicking autopilot everywhere because it was painful, literally painful to fly (had to try and use joystick and mouse and keynoard all at once cause one a few controls can be mapped ect)  .............IF YOU LIKE SPACE GAMES TO GIVE YOU THE FEELING OF FLYING AROUND SPACE DO NOT GET THIS GAME!Maybe in the future it can be fixed, but right now this plays out as more of an economic simulator (buy/sell grind with owning farms/mines ect and adding your home made stuff to your buying and selling grind. The originality in alot of areas is actually pretty good but it fails in the most very basic most important area.... it does not feel like a space game.			"

												Bought this game a couple of weeks ago when I heard about a UI update, and I've been having a blast. I've bounced off other sandboxy games like Wurm, but this one is holding my attention so far. Lots to do, and a lot of thought has been put into making even the basic activities like mining more fun than just holding down left-click and letting stuff float into your inventory.The game is also pretty easy to get into and wrap your head around, despite having a ton of depth to it. Can't recommend it enough for space fans, unless you absolutely NEED PvP to have fun.			"

								Being a freelancer veteran from way back, this game instantly appealed to me when i found it in the Early Access section of steam. After getting the hang of the controls, i can say this is definitely a call back to the golden age of space sims. Enjoying every minute of it, with the overcomplication of controls in most other space sims nowadays (some of which you need a user manual sitting by your side constantly) the controls feel smooth and natural, if i had any criticism at all it would only be that i haven't yet found a way to lock the third person camera to the rear of the ship. Early days for this game, but it shows a huge amount of potential, and the gameplay is already much more polished than many games which are at full-release point on steam.			"

								TL;DR Try it for free at http://www.thespacegame.com/play.html before you buyI started playing this game in April of 2014 but after a few months I got busy with other thigs and stopped playing. I finally picked it up again about a week ago and I completely regret having left. Most of the bugs and promised features from when I left have been implemented and the game has progressed extremely far and I'm very excited to see where it's going to go and to be a part of that.As to what I specifically like about the game. The best thing by far is the community. I have never encountered a community so helpful and encouraging before. The more experienced players are willing to go way out of their way to help others. It's honestly amazing and I hope it stays that way. I also like the focus on PvE (if you want PvP or combat in general it hasn't really been worked on yet so you might want to wait) The game really allows you to create your own interplanetary empire and expand it to your hearts content, but within that you can focus on so many different things like mining, trading, production, exploring, or dabble in them all. It reall has so many amazingly detailed features considered how early it is in development and while it certainly has a learning curve, it's extremely easy to learn quickly if you ask for help from the community. Overall I think it's a great game and is worth the try. Plus if you want to try it out before buying it on steam you can do so for free at http://www.thespacegame.com/play.html. So I ecourage you to give it a try and see how you like it.			"

								Here's a little video introduction I made, showing what the gameplay is like:


YouTube™ Video: Ascent - The Space Game First Look 01 

			Views: 1,845		

			Ascent - The Space Game just released on Steam Early Access today. It's described as a PVE sandbox space MMO with base building, trading, etc.		

I'm really digging it so far. The tutorial is easy to follow, the controls are smooth, and navigating around is pain free. You can either free fly or click on destinations to autopilot, and when you do that it's FAST. I mean, you're at your destination almost instantly. I've never played a space game before where getting around was so quick and painless.As you move from station to station you can accept contracts, which change at random intervals. There's also a story mission that starts during the tutorial and continues, leading you ""breadcrumb"" style through the different aspects of the game... trading, navigating, accepting contracts, and so on, until eventually you're led to start exploring.The main draw, for me at least, is the PVE focus. PVP sandbox space games are a dime a dozen, but the developers of Ascent - The Space Game have decided to do something different to really stand out from the crowd, and I couldn't be happier.Land you can develop SimCity style, placing buildings and such? It's in there, yep. Way cool. This game reminds me of Yankee Trader / Trade Wars in that way, how you can own and manage property. Blueprints for different buildings and technologies are expensive at first, but Rome wasn't built in a day was it?[Update 3/1/2015]I've put some more time into it and I've noticed a few areas that could use some improvement. First off, sometimes it's not real obvious what to do, or how to do what you want to do. For example, I was looking at the shipyard and found an ultra light fighter and it was cheap, so I bought it. I flew around but I couldn't shoot anything. I thought maybe it didn't come with guns, but I couldn't figure out how to look. I ran through the tutorial again just to make sure, and when the drone came out I was able to shoot it (took FOREVER) but before and after that my guns didn't do anything. I had to ask in chat what was up and people said they only work if you're aiming at an enemy NPC or an asteroid. Oh, that would have been nice to know, the UI should tell you why things aren't working.I got a quest to deliver 10 miner robots to 3 different places, but I couldn't figure out where to get them. I had to ask around and someone said ""contract board"". Oh, so you have to get these from the contract board, but it's random whether you'll find them available there. Nothing in the contract description says this, and if the NPC who gave me the contract to deliver these robots told me, I'd forgotten.I sold my starter ship because I didn't think I'd need it anymore. I put it up on the global market, and then it was gone. I changed my mind and wanted to cancel the sale but nothing I could find in the UI or any of the menus showed how to do that. I googled it and searched the forums but no answer. Again I had to ask in chat, and they said ""Just buy it back from the GM."" I found another starter ship just like the one I'd just sold for even less and bought it, but huh, that was awkward.What I'm saying is, the UI could use some improvement. More information. Maybe the tutorial could also explain things a bit better. Also, I asked and was told that there's not really much in the way of co-op in the game. There aren't incentives for co-op or any way to form wings or squadrons. There are a few shared community projects like gates and such, but in terms of forming a group to go raid a base or provide escort, that's not really a thing. More social / co-op features would be good. Maybe random events or group missions? Or pirates building bases or sending out invasion fleets, making people have to band together to drive them back? I don't know, I think things like that are probably being planned.Being a sandbox game it's easy to get lost or reach a point where you're not sure what to do next. That's my problem with most sandbox games and this one is no exception. I'd like to be a combat pilot and take contracts for bounty missions but it looks like you pretty much have to do mining and trading before you can get a ship good enough for combat. So yes, technically you're free to do whatever you want, but you still have to jump through certain hoops to get there. Still though, the game is way more accessible than the X series or Evochron Mercenary.			"

												I like this game but it still needs work.  The mining is interactive and building settlements is fun to do the first few times but once you get a bigger ship and a few settlements going, what do you do?  Make more money and build a stargate to some far away system?  Build ships to sell to the few people who play the game?  If the game had more players, it would be much more fun but right now there is really not much motivation for me to keep going in the game.The game itself is fun so I am going to give it a positive review but the playerbase needs to grow in order for this game to reach its potential.

												I would not recommend to purchase this game. The Bad:- The controls, camera movement, and quasi-realistic-but-totally-not ship movement are a huge step backward compared to many other space games. For instance, even though it is easy to implement in Unity, there isn't a mouse look mode option. Instead one has to hold the right mouse button (only in FPS view) to use the mouse look, which has a massive dead zone that can't be changed and causes UI elements to be activated  and control to be lost when the mouse moves over them. Inexcusable, even for an ""indie game"" - I didn't have any problem following the mouse look tutorials when I was working with Unity.- The land based graphics are straight out of 1991, but it looks nice in space. - The human characters are honestly laughable.  They would be fine for an open source hobby game, but not in a game people are expected to pay for.- Streaming assets rather than simply allowing all the assets to be downloaded ahead of time. I don't care that Guild Wars 2 takes 30GB of my hard drive space - at least it doesn't completely freeze because it has to download new assets when I turn the camera. - Memory leaks that cause my computer to lock up, while the game thrashes the living daylights out my drives. Only way to stop it is to turn off the PC. - The quest system is incomplete and does not have proper tracking or logs, as we have grown to expect with games since the days of MUDs.  - System messages and quest text are also not logged, so if you miss some information it's just gone. - MANY people have complained (in the short time I played) about the salvaging mission being nearly impossible to complete, due to the poorly developed UI. The developer doesn't see this as his problem, rather as the player's lack of skill. It is 100% a game design issue (lay folk didn't have any issues with SWG Jump to Lightspeed quests, in my several years of experience helping people in that game... because the UI was made by professionals). The Good: - It's a PvE game and you can't even accidentally die or lose your ship. - The mining and commodity trading mini games are well done. - If you enjoy playing ""Space Trucker"", then this game is worth looking at. You can make lots of credits just auto piloting from place to place, buying low and selling high as you go.- It's not utterly awful, but it's not good either. It would make a fine open source game that people could dabble in and submit patches for, but it isn't something that I would feel comfortable charging money for had it been one of the games I made; it shouldn't be a commercial product. Lesson learned: Don't spend money on ""indie games"". The hype is real...WARNING: Steam will not give you refund if you play long than 2 hours. It took me several hours of reading and tinkering just to figure out what to do...			"

								Well worth 15 dollars.-Pros- Works with xbox controller under pinnacle game profiler flawlessly- A newtonian colonization sci fi experience that you could easily spend 100-1000 hours on- Only one developer, but is extremely active, releases patches regularly and can be spoken with in-game easily- A friendly community that doesn't care to help noobs- Nearly 3 billion star systems, and ones you discover are named after you forever- Good newtonian physics- Awesome ship diversity - i'd guess there are 20-30 ships in the game but they are very robust and more are being added- NPC auto trade system - Smuggler system- Extremely complex colony and starbase system that can be customized- Good soundtrack and atmosphere, in-game AI SAM 5000 is based on HAL from 2001 a space odyssey he's very amusing- Minimalist gfx, but still a pretty game- Stargates are developed by a team effort of players- Planets are terraformed by a team effort of players and it takes like a year- Advanced gravity and atmosphere based on real newtonian physics- Skim gas giants for fuel- Finally a game with interesting asteroid mechanics. you have to chase rocks down manually, point them to a certain temperature to get the best yield results. It also has some cool rare asteroids that feel rewarding when you find them- Cons- Confusing monthly fee that is based on tiers and is kind of hidden from you until after you buy what appears to be an online-only client - game is free to play after you buy the client but at a steep cost in the form of restricted features- Fifteen bucks for no singleplayer- Doesn't work on Linux even despite being developed in unity- Ran like garbage on my Macbook even despite being developed in unity- Playerbase is only 30 to 40 players in the absolute best case scenario, community could die at any moment- Like most sandbox games, this is only for players who can entertain themselves in a sandbox- Repetitive trading expected with most space games, but this game is worse because some galaxies have dozens of player colonies so jumping into said system causes extreme lag - Making colonies and planting domes sounds good and all, but there's alot of research required to get into this game and you need to know that setting up your colonies requires actual console commands and some math skills- Game rewards players who are the most intelligent and spend the most time, this is a good or a bad thing depending on your perspective- Combat sucks in this game so bad but it is early access. nobody does combat in this game right now because it is a painfully frustrating experience- Game is basically a singleplayer experience with an MMO gimmick. There's no function that allows you to team up with other players, and interaction with other players is limited to financial transactions- Can explore unknown star systems, but all are empty and generic. some planets have no textures whatsoever and look lame. stars only come in three types. some systems might have an asteroid belt with rare spawns but that's about it. you wouldn't want to colonize these unknown stars systems as they are so far away so exploring them is mostly pointless- No npc missions aside from courier runs (trading) and most aren't worth doing. not much to do in this game if you're not building a colony or a starbaseShould note that the game does have a premium option, you get three months with the purchase and after that it's 1.00 per month per tier to a maximum of 3.00 per month. Premium features include being able to fly class 13+ ships, mount class 13+ weapons, and to have 8 free newbie colonies in the NPC populated core systems. IMO, having the starting newbie systems for a dollar a month isn't really worth it, except for the fact that without it you can't build more than six rings on your newbie starbase (you get the first starbase free). It's a significant disadvantage as starbases cap out at 100 rings. The newbie colonies are not as robust as the outer colony system and are extremely limited - one can only expect yields of 10,000 resources per colony per half day or day depending on colony efficiency whereas the outer colony systems can yield MILLIONS or even BILLIONS per day as they are huge, and furthermore can yield more than one resource. They can also act as player controlled trade hubs.			"

								Why am I so addicted to this game? I think it is because there is so much to do and I don't have to wait years to do it; I can upgrade my ship and I don't need to wait for skills to train to do anything in it ( like Eve). I can work twards exploration and building things in the game that matter, to help the whole game progress. If i get board I can switch to something else and the depth of features is impressive. Interesting maket structure seems to draw me in so far.I can't wait to explore the endless universe!I suggest you watch all the videos and read the wiki because the only other effective way to learn is by asking people in game.

												This game is a particularly successful way of making a space game fun to play at least for a few months off gaming.The universe is full of delightful things to discover and to enjoy.  While there is a lot to learn, it is easily taken on board in incremental steps of discovery.  The Ascent Wiki is fantastic, as are the You Tube demonstrations. There is not shortage of tutoarial materials that you can access that will explain everything to you.  As well as this, there is a very helpful community online that are happy to take the time to answer questions as they are asked.There is little in the way of major conflict, (unless you choose to go looking for it), as conflict is currently optional at this time. There is no Galactic War going on and I am thankful for this fact.  Having grown tired after years of eternal shoot them ups, I really enjoy this as a hobby style adventure of wonder and discovery.  The online players are working in a collaborative effort to unfold ""Space, the Final Frontier"" as you read this review.I read that the developer intends to ultimately make a PVP area for those that are busting to have a fight with their space ships and there is already at this time a PVE area that is optional to go into.The graphics are reasonable. (There have been major upgrades ongoing and getting better all the time). The personal development is great.  The trading system works OK.  There are tons of things to do that are interesting: such as finding new places to fly and trade, discovering new worlds that get named after you, building bigger and better ships, building and developing colonies / making your own starbases / your own mining operations / researching new technology / building stargates / running for political office ingame / building the community / interacting with some very nice people / learning new strategy to build up your own wealth and prestige and lots of discovery.  There is lots of intricasy in this game.  Enough to keep you interested and occupied for a very long time.  There are lots of incredibly interesting details to learn in producing space stations / colony settlements / automted factories and NPC run trading runs.The game is very well priced for what you get.  For those that choose to stay with the game over the long term in the community and continue to grow your ownership there is an ""option"" to pay an ongoing fee of just three dollars a month.  There are no other costs to players.  You can play for free as long as you want to, but have some limitations on on how big you can become.  I think this is fair enough as the developer is endeavouring to keep the cost to a bare minimum.  I can't see any similar level of game that keeps the price at this level.The game, (as with most others), has a few minor bugs and glitches from time to time, but none of these I have found to be a game-breaking event.  The game saves itself automatically, all the time, as you play.  If anything goes wrong, a simple restart of the game has always gotten rid of the problem and put  me right back where I was with the problem solved. On the negative side I must say that the game has not got long-term playing possibilities with ongoing fun.  I found that after 6 months of play, I had exhausted the game and that it became tedious for me.			"

								Ascent the Space Game is a wonderful find, I've been playing for months and am not tired of it yet in the least.The concept behind the game is that you begin piloting a basic ship, and make your way into the universe.  Tutorial missions will guide you at first, and it's definitely worth it to complete these as they will give you access to a plot of land to place some mines on, a Star Base in which you can construct components necessary to colonize worlds, build ships, etc.The game universe consists of a small core of 9 NPC run inner planets.  Each planet is in a system, and you travel between them using gates.Outside of that is when the game really begins... as there are millions of unexplored star systems out there.  Players can explore, colonize worlds and build colonies producing minerals, food, alcohol, etc.  Construction of Gates between these systems are large cooperative projects, but there are many already in place and more planned.Which brings me to the community.  The player community in Ascent is fantastic.  I've rarely felt at home in a game like I do in Ascent.  Certainly one of the big selling points to me.  Another positive for me is that PVP is not really an issue.  Roughly a quarter of the Galaxy is designated for the ""Red Zone"", which is the only place PvP can take place (it wasn't in effect at the time of this review).  The game is still in development... changes come often.  New ships, new asteroids to mine, new things to build with new minerals, smuggling is soon to be added, and PvE combat will be a priority after that.For the price, I don't think you can go wrong.  Yes there is a small (and I do mean small) monthly fee for advanced features, but the game comes with three months for free which you can activate when you want.So if the thought of getting into a ship and exploring, mining, colonizing untamed worlds, etc... while interacting with an outstanding gaming community, appeals to you... then you just can't go wrong with Ascent the Space Game.

												Game is very fun feels good sounds good.galactic map is trash -1/10 its really really bad doesnt help you find your way just waistes hours of your lifecant select destinations to a specific spacestation so you spend hours reading giant list not in alphabetical order so it takes hours. and sometimes a player posted a buy order on a planet and you cant sell to a planet so you waiste hours. do to stupid shtsthis game needs alot of work to make it enjoyable. its playable but id make my own map. to find my way around.mining 8/10 easy pays alotmarket set up... 4/10 due to not being able to set a way point to a location takes forever to sell your♥♥♥♥♥♥br>combat. 4/10 pve only ... not even pvp zonescolony spaceport building 9/10 easy fun walking around on a ""Naked"" colored planet is not really true. the scaling of your person on a planet will take you 2 hours to walk what looks like 5 min of walking.game isnt user friendly needs alot of work.. waypoints need to be added map needs to be made so its fun and easy to usegive this game 6 months to a year... if nothing changes it will die. lots of players are maxed out and bored out of their mind. pve .... needs pvp or people stop siming lol "

												This game is broke beyond repair, and the one and only dev has all but abandoned it. You can read his last post of 21st of April.Also look at the bugs forums for the game, not 1 has been acknowlaged, or replied to by the 1 dev that from his own post it trying to manage everything, including running a software company.I think this was 1 guys project, that did not comprehend what was necessary, and this is evident by the whole company being 1 person.Steam needs to remove this game from their lists & issue refunds to everyone.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, You will waste a lot of time in frustration and never get it fixed.

								Ascent, a space game that has lots of POTENTIAL, some people might say this is a rip off EVE Online (As the creator took inspiration from EVE) well no, its completely different the amount of detail in this is amazing, I spent 4 hours on this and loss track of time doing stuff making money, mining, doing quests, doing contracts, selling items, trading with players and  Iv only got 2 space ships so imagine what you can do with in the future and this game is really fun from my point of veiw. You can call this a EVE rip off, a wait for Star Citizen, Im not going to call it either of them, I call it a masterpiece for the current state its in.			"

								We might be looking at the next epic space game. For an early access game, i can tell you it's not a waste of money. I am happy with the amount of content this game has so far. The ""one man dev team"" does a good job at adding new material and fixing bugs with each patch. I for one want to be a part of watching this game continue to grow and develop. I am excited about the future of Ascent. In my 40 hours of playing, i have seen a steady increase in player population. The game is definitely heading in the right direction. Now if this ""one man dev team"" can pick up a few more team members that share the same vision.....well hell, this could be my next addiction. I know my $20 went towards a gem in the making. Dont get all sore about the small monthly fee ( optional ) for the premium account. You can still do almost everything in the game without it. I for one, will have no prob paying the 5 or 6 dollars a month extra so i can use mining beams higher than class 5 or make my space station larger or what not.  I have a job, i work for a living. I too, need money to maintain. So please dont let that discourage you from buying this game.  Ascent-The Space Game is a must buy for anyone who has ever played ANY space game before this. This Dev has a dream....and im excited to see it brought to life little by little. Grats go out to the ""one man dev team""!!! Keep up the good work :)			"

								I've played EVE for a long time. And eventually I was getting pretty tired of it, because... well, it's nothing more than a good screensaver if you focus on Industry (or even on PvE).However, in this game, Industry is well thought out. You can create your own colonies on planets and even your own giant space station (and I mean GIGANTIC).It's well worth the price just to try it out. When there's more content, I'm sure that it will get very good.			"

												Do you know why I am throwing 90 dollars at an unarmed heavy freighter?Because the developers actively sit in the help channel and help the players. I am not kidding. Just get the game, and watch the help chat for a while. I can guarantee that at some point during the day, you will see someone with a blue name. Those are devs. I've seen two so far in my 11 hours of game play. This level of dedication and active response is nearly unheard of now a days.Now for the actual game, it is plain but growing, for right now. It is truly a space merchant simulator, as combat is rather limited right now. It's mostly resource gathering, contract completing, and bartering, but it is growing very rapidly, and I'm in for the long haul. Pay close attention to the menus, browse the ingame help, and you'll learn very quickly. With a bit of thinking and a little planning, you can advance quickly. I already have a class 5 vessel. Then there's the comprehensive wiki, where you can REALLY get down to the micro-managing of your funds and start raking in the dough.That's all I have to say for now. It's a great game with great potentional.Honk honk, get out of my way, I've got a Bowhead.			"

								To me the game is great.  I have a few hours invested in it and am very impressed with the updates since last April.  The quality has improved greatly and the gameplay is also impoving.  With one Developer, an Artist, and now a UI Programmer  it is amazing what has been done thus far.  The Community is great and much like a family, even down to the sibling rivalry between some, but somehow they all come together and help out newcomers as much as they can.  If you can't get an answer in-game there is a wiki that has a tutorial walkthrough that is very helpful for rookies.  The in-game help file references it.  With the up-coming full release we are promised a pvp as well as the pve game.  Yes the game has some rough edges, yes there is a subscription model, 1 dollar up to 3 dollars a month, (servers have to be kept running), and yes it is 20 dollars, but the developer and his team have a passion for the game I haven't seen for a long while.  I am excited to see where this development company goes!Cheers, and hope to see you all in Space~~~			"

								My review of Ascent, the few people who do play it are so busy that you can't get help. The graphics are from 8bit pong. When you do get the hang of the game your so bored that you just want to walk away. This game has a few good things going for it but for 20 dollars you can go see a movie and feel alot better. I did find a few videos on youtube. But without other players you just building a empire to see if you can do it. on a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 3 for just nice idea, try again in a few years when they have a base of people to play with.

								Let's start with this is not an EVE Online clone, this game is not a clone of anything.JAM took what we knew about MMO Sandbox Space games and just threw it all out the window and somehow, somewhere he came up with Ascent. The Short Question: Is the game good?The Short Answer: I have to force myself to go and sleep, I have to force myself to walk away from my computer. I cannot get enough of this game !!The section where i get to brag about this game, because i am proud that i am apart of the Ascent Universe.Ascent is the 1st space sandbox that i have played that Actually get the sandbox part right. Except for the inner 9 systems, EVERYTHING is player made, EVERYTHING is discovered by players... , Gates, Colonies, Ships, Star Bases, everything. The economy, even the politics are player driven.So what can you do in the game ? Anything you want. There is nothing stopping you to just explore or to become a pure Gate Builder, want to create a giant empire .. go for it, just want to mine or only build ships, its all there you choose your own path. There are no skill trees or training that limit your path it is open and you can play the game anyway you like.One of the 1st things that caught my attention was the community. The Ascent community is like no other MMO i have played. The community is extremely helpfull and friendly.If you like pve orientated (There will be pvp comming but it will not be the main focus of the game), sapce game, where the universe is the literally the limit this is the game for you.There is a sub of $3 a month to unlocak all the premium content. $3 ? that is NOTHING !! My sub is paid all the way to 2017. what can you buy for $3 .. a burger ? Now you can be part of one of the best space MMO's ever created. Still in beta and not yet fully released, i am super excited to be part of the experience. JAM has some really epic things planned and I cannot wait.Hope to see you online. "

												State of the CompanyI am not getting paid anymore, and I'm personally almost out of money. I'm in the red, if you add it all up, probably not what where you want to be a few months before your 40th birthday, but as I said to a colleague in the middle of an all night coding binge:""I would rather go bust making something special, than get rich developing something 'meh'."" And I think that just about sums up the Fluffy Kitten Studios philosophy, for now. The company is not in great shape. Sales until now have slowed to a crawl. I think people are thoroughly sick of buying early access games in general, and Steam is now absolutely flooded with indie titles all vying for the same market. The number of games has grown at a pace that leaves the market growth for dead, and the vast majority of our potential playerbase has still never heard of us (this became abundantly clear at PAX, where most people we met were Australian - and we've had some press traction here - and almost none had heard of us).We now have over 19,000 people who has wishlisted Ascent who haven't bought it yet. We expect a small portion of those to buy it when we ""release"" (steam has just begun emailing wishlisters when a game comes out of early access, fortuitous timing for us) but we will also need some action from the press to sustain development for the rest of the year.And that about sums it up. It is now very much crunch time for Ascent and Fluffy Kitten Studios. There is no chance the company will fold or the game will end (I still run it on a test server at home and it's fine. I could operate it for you with NO income), but there is also no chance I will be 100% full time on the game any more in May or June if we can't FINALLY get some press traction and make some significant sales.So, everything now hinges on what happens on April 11 and the following few weeks. Fingers crossed our press release gets through this time.From the Developer's mouth.  What 3 Dev's are working on this game? Bull crap!. 3 devs have worked on this game in the past but NOT anymore.  The game will NOT be developed anymore unless the STEAM sales makes it so and look at the steam forums a few noobs and a few fan boy's.  You will get tired of mining, trading and building colonies btw the graphics for the colonies is early 1990's. $20 bucks is a total rip off, even at 50% off its more of a waste of your time. Maybe if this was made 15 years ago it might be worth some time but with games today why in the hell would you play this one.  The bad ........ The state of the Company. Nuff said. The good......When you uninstall it and make better use of your game time.			"

								What the Dev has done here is pretty incredible, in Unity3d of all engines, I didn't imagine seeminglsly taking of from a huge planet, travelling through space then landing on another planet without a loading screen, very well made. However! This isn't a con to me but might be to many others, it's a very complicated game as far as games go, you need to invest a lot of time to learn the functionality. The rewards are great, but I would say for casual gamers stay away and maybe try starmade to avoid having to use your brain.			"

								This game has huge potential, beautiful graphics, and a lot of graphical bugs (still early access). Most of the bugs seem to be related to graphics and updating on screen information, which isn't a big deal since it is not causing me to much grief, the game does crash from time to time, usually after three to four hours of continuous play, restarting and logging back in seems to fix the issue and does not do it again.The trading, mining, and settlement building is fun if not a little tedious. Exploring new star systems is a great feature, knowing that no one else has ever been there is nice if not making you feel a little lonely in the vastness of space. The game world is so large i don't think the word ""vast"" would cover it. The ability to out fit your ship with what type of hyperdrive/warp drive/ shield etc. is very nice, being able to use NPC traders to move your goods around is also useful for when you are not online, first few days of play are the most time consuming. But once you are up and running you can make large sums of money to easily and money pretty much becomes useless at a certain point.Overall a solid game with large potential especially for being only in alpha.

												This Game is the Game I have yearned for my whole life.Sure, its in its infancy and the graphics are not AAA but for someone that loves building an empire in space, this game is looking like the one for me.Unlike so many space games, you cant be Ganked here. Thats key for me.A persistent universe where i can gradually unwrap the layers of the game and learn its complexities as i go, slowly but surely building from my little hornet starter into a sprawling empire (hopefully) over time will keep me busy and interested for many months if not years to come.The in game help chat has been amazing, and the responsiveness of the developer to player issues has been nothing short of stellar. If enough of you out there that are looking for a corner of the universe and buy into this game, I think it will become something very, very special as its grows into its full potential.			"

								I was set to give this game a thumbs up, until I found that unlike other games of its type (3-4x, open ended, etc.), this gmae does not travel to other computers, that is to say allow you to play the same character on multiple computers.Beyond that major hiccup, the game is a good basic version of games like the Elite series, or even EVE, in that your successes are based on the equipment and situations you find yourself in. Ex. Having reached Midshipman rank at this point, as long as you keep an eye on your armor and center the reticles on the target, you can survive a battle with pirates in the border system(s) where they can be found. The only other negative worth mentioning  which occurs on a regular basis is that not all of the wreck debris that appears is retrieveable/scanable. One piece which resembles a ship from the old Bablyon 5 series, no matter the acceptable range, is able to be scanned/retrieved.			"

I love Indie games with new ideas and fresh concepts on a budget.  This game was just totally uninspiring for me.  (And I'm a grinder)  I usually love chasing the carrot for days or weeks to get some small achievemnet or betterment.  I never saw the carrot in this game.

If you think graphics are the most important part of a game, go ahead and pass this up for now, but keep an eye on it.  It DOES have it's beautiful parts, and it has come a long way since it was first released.  (not that I was there, but the videos are out there)The developer is completely awesome and logs in to his own game fairly often, listens to his players, and SUPPORTS his players.  Right now the game seems fairly grindy and linear, but if this game keeps it's momentum up it could be a whole lot more.			"

								A fantastic game which is very similiar to what star citizen is going to be like but without the fancy graphics.  Loads of fun, 270 BILLION procedurely generated systems/planets to explore and colonise.  Lots of things to craft, but therein lies the problem... the grinding...  If you ever played Life is Feudal you will know what this game is like...Its a straight up grind fest to the point you really contemplate on whether if there is any point to continue ...  Most people want to explore, find and name a system themselves but you cant till you can acquire the proper ship and resources to do so... to get to that point you have to grind and grind and grind and grind and grind, and grind and grind daily on every little thing you do... To research up say mining beams from class 1-12 takes like 100+ days minimum let alone anything above class 12...  not to mention the hundred other modules, or processes you will need to level up.    There are players who have been playing since the kickstarter some 2 years and are still researching things in game... it just seems like everything you research takes 24 hours.... And you have huge lists of things you need researched to be able to craft/sell/use etc....  This is not a game for the casual gamer or person who has a steady job...  Its a fun game but in its current state at the time of me writing this the grind times are just not properly balanced and take to long to allow you to get out and really do the fun stuff comparitively speaking....   It almost seems the grind times are to make up for the lack of content and i do hope jam plans on changing that... i do recommend the game but only if you have butt loads of time to devote to it or you will be disappointed.Bugs/ issues at time of this review that stand out to me:1. vanishing asteroids just as you mine them2. poor key binding options3.  UI still needs work to be made user friendly4.  More available ""add alias"" needed5. mouse wheel zoom speed needs to be increased6. all ships need additional thrusters for 6dof and not just fwd thrust7. increased purple contracts needed8. better pricing on contracts especially if you took the time to build the ceres farm or other mines9. Need a way to close the game properly (see #3)10. Need better audio settings11.  If your starbase warehouse has all materials needed to build a new module you shouldnt have to transfer it to your ship to just supply the module to start construction... the warehouse should be able to feed everything on the SB at all times.12.  in game help file needs updated bad13.  Grind times- just need balancing for fun/achievement14. In game chat could use some updates like pm's...block user, add friend with color tags or something etc ...Final Thoughts:    I do plan to continue playing as i am having fun but im also frustrated knowing i have another month of nonstop grinding before im self sufficient enough to be able to afford to start doing the really fun stuff like exploring.  I understand this is very early in its release and is why im still going to play to see how things pan out.   "

												First thing off the mark, this is a game with great potential.It is a great game to play, though it has a few limitations that reduce the length of time I will be involved in it.The background of the game is that a spacefaring human civilisation has collapsed to the point where only a few systems clustered together and linked by stargates survive.Starting in a small ship, you are now equipped to begin your career as a Civilian Pilot and help to being prosperity to the Inner Systems, and to expand into the greater unknown to colonise and restore humanity to its former position as a sprawling mass of connected systems.The way to wealth and advancement in the early part of the game is to follow the starter missions which allow you to begin to develop your own plot of land as an Inner Settlement, then expand to your own Inner Starbase.  During the starter narrative and missions, you learn to trade, mine and skim Gas Giants for resources – just to name a few.It is engaging and there is a lot to discover.As you progress and, when you activate the Premium subscription you get with the game purchase (3 months of each type of Premium access), you are able to firstly create and develop Settlements on 8 of the Inner Nine (I9) systems, and greatly expand your Inner Starbase.During this time, your Trading and asteroid Mining skills will increase, as can you Skimming skills if you continue to farm Gas Giants for resources.Outside of the I9 are the Outer Systems.Everything here is developed by the players – well, the Jam-1 system is a little different.So, in the systems that are not part of the starting area, every Stargate and every colony and every Starbase has been built by the player community.  I say player community as the Stargates themselves require so much in the way of resources, it requires a number of players co-operating to complete these projects.At all times, you are able to pilot your ship to these Outer Systems to buy from players at their Starbases and colonies, and haul resources back to the I9 to increase profit.That’s the basics and I have mostly enjoyed my experience.  There are a few things that imo are missing, could be better, or could just go…One of my big questions rattling around in my head has been, if humans got this far into the galaxy, even after a collapse, there should be something left.  But there isn’t.  I don’t get that.  As a player explores new star systems with the intent to colonise and therefore open up new areas, surely there would at least be a remnant of the former civilisation.  As you can EVA on planets, I think it would be great to explore ruins of previous colonies.  Hey, there may even be some active NPC colonies out there???Research is a bit, well, meh.  You do have to research new buildings for colonies and Starbases but, after that, it is really only improving on current technology.  I would like to see something better implemented here and, if the game incorporated “lost colonies” it would be really cool if you could find “scraps” of past knowledge that might open up new research horizons.The Political System is a bit raw, and really may not be necessary.  It is really only a system by which to name Planets and Star Systems, and these can change again if a new player is elected to a position of power.  This system has caused some schisms to form and can easily be used as a rather nasty piece pf metagame PVP.  When the Dev had to get involved with a particular dispute on the Forums, he mentioned the Constitutional Rights of the Senators (who can name Star Systems and approve Stargates), but there is no Constitution that I could find…so maybe if there was one, or if System names could only be changed by some sort of consensus, it may avoid the complications of the past.One thing that I really like about this game is the player community.  They are, in the main, helpful and encouraging every step of the way.  Freely giving advice and helping when you’re stuck or unsure, the community makes this game that much more enjoyable.  There are a couple of nasties, but their impact is easily avoided.This is a great game and should be experienced to its full.  I only hope that new directions are implemented so that someone like me can be engaged in other areas as well. "

												OK, so with almost 100 hours of play itme.  I am giving the Game itself a thumbs UP andhighly recomending people play it.  The grachics are GREAT, lots to do, there can be some tedium in things but overall stellar game.Now as for the current add on content of the bowhead, im sorry but it is NOT worth paying 90.0 for an ingame ship.  so stop trying to rip off players.  The MOSt anyone should pay for ingame content including a ship is maybe $20.00 maximum. NOT $90.00.  Buy the game DO NOT BUY The addon ships			"

								Sierra's ""Homeworld"" had better graphics than this.The tutorial only showed me how to dock, undock, buy and rely on autopilot. I was told there were other tutorials, but the game is just too bland and boring for me to dig these awful and unintuitive menus that tend to glitch between one window and another.Not worth the buy. IDK if this is early access or not. This is early alpha. They shouldn't be asking for money for something this unfinished.			"

												Great game for space enthusiasts as it really feels like someone put alot of effort into building a great game with lots to do, think about and research. With billions of systems to find and planets to study you really feel like your an explorer trying to find a new home for the human race. Making factorys colonys, and advancing your own technolgies it really feels like a smart in depth game. The game is very addicting and i found i myself starting with trading and makign space stations to build better parts for my ships. Its only after a wile when i finally gopt moreu sed to the game i realised there is a huge universe to explore and so much to do which feels rewarding when its finally done.Anyway love this game and sohappy to see it finally released after playign 2 years about it feelsgreat to seejamdoign well.

												As a budding game dev myself and an Australian as well, I'm all for supporting developers who have basically made games on their own. One man to start with, Kenshi is one of these (CaptainDeathbeard). Ascent is one of these, at first you go eww the graphics are so 90s but then you do a couple of quests as part of the tutorial then you start to go. ""ok this is getting better"" then you work out salavaging, trading, building your own base and space station, of which you get as part of the tutorial ( bare bones of course).. bit of grinding trading , salavge or pve fighting and you'll start getting better and richer. It's like EvE Online without the anoying unbalanced PvP ( War Decs ect) BUT You find new planets, name them, settle systems, become govenor terraform planets, there's  270 Billion start systems, and it is better than nomans sky in that sense. Outsdie of the first nine systems everything is player made, run and ruled. So you may feel alone at the start. But they are out there! .. I'm loving it. Just ignore the graphics K :PGame is availiable for free on the web site, but I have no problem spending 6ish bucks a month, thats about 3 bucks for the rest of you =)			"

												Incredible game.  Bit of a challenging learning curve early on but there are tutorial walkthroughs both ingame and on a wiki, plus the playerbase is old school friendly.  This is a game about making your mark on the universe.  I am 45 days in and just don't have enough time to do everything I want.  The mining is interesting and profitable.  I've got a few colonies growing, one on a terraformed world to make me feel good and two that require domes to build.  I have helped build a few jump gates but can't wait to start making my own.  It's possible to solo build them but really they are community projects and continually change the game.  I think I have got 380 systems named after me - that never gets old.If you like to play  a game at your own pace and experiment a bit, this games for you.			"

So something for everyone as to how they would like to play/flourish in game. Would like to see planetary defence from attackers, which haven't seen mentioned yet, but hopefully with enough interest, will become part of game.Few bugs here an there, which you would expect for a early release game, but gradually being ironed out.

								I'll keep this short. Don't bother reading my review below. Just get No Man's Sky when it comes out. It's what this game should of been. 


YouTube™ Video: No Man's Sky: 18 Minute Gameplay Demo - IGN First 

			Views: 5,618,522		

			Hello Games founder Sean Murray gives us a guided tour of one planet in No Man's Sky's universe as our month-long IGN First coverage kicks off.		

This game takes just too long to update. I've been playing this game about 2 years before it came out of steam and been waiting and waiting for updates but the updates are too slow and none of them ""game changing."" Still no combat really. No reason to explore. I'd prefer to have rare resources out there guarded by heavily armed aliens or other aggressive factions but there's just nothing to do after you've built your colony. All the mining you do on your colony is of no use and just piles up. All the gates you create... for what??? Takes 100million tons and 30,000 round trips and for what? It's a gate to nowhere just like the bridge to nowhere built in Alaska. This game lacks sense of purpose. If you want to enjoy the game for maybe 100 hours, and don't mind the 1990 graphics, then get it. But if you're looking for more than just a limited fun game then I'd say look elsewhere. I'm waiting for No Man's Sky. It's almost exactly what I was hoping for in this game. Check out the vid above towards the end. It was what the creator of this game envisioned (100 billions of stars to discover) but unfortunately the execution wasn't done well so now you're left with nothing to do in this vast empty space.

								-10/10After almost 200 hours of play,I can honestly say this is a snore of a game,to call it boring & tedious is just being kind.Several already gave good details of the games poor quality such as the computer use, UI  & other various aspects of the game. I can only add that this game has more bugs than a junkyard dog with flees,It reminded of the late 90's when every pencil necked programming geek wanted to make a quick buck to get into the PC gaming rush.Most were never even gamers & u could easily tell by the amount of horrible games that sprung out at that time.To expand on some of the others comments :Research is ridiculous what should take hours actualy takes days  & worst no way to improve it ROFL.(Except to sign on to another alt and pay another sub fee :(Never gonna happen cause this game will never see anymore money from me thats for sure.Just so you understand i have been paying for World of Warcraft for over 4 years Sub & still paying, worth every penny!!!I think the biggest scam i saw was that new people were given free or cheap upgrades in the game as to lull them into believing this is a great game & community I played the game with out such obvious tactics cause thats the only way to see if i would like it. This clearly is a way to get people to make a quick positive comment without even putting in any effort. ( Give me money instead & i would still toss this Turd into the Dung Heap. )I want my 19.99 Back cause the free version never played for me & I made the mistake in believing all the fluff in positive comments.(Now i read the negative first ! )I will have 2nd thoughts about ever buying a Early access game again. o/			"

								Had to refund this one...I really wanted to play this game...problem is the first hour of play was spent almost entirely fighting bugs that were preventing me from even completing the first couple steps of the tutorial.1) Dock at the SS to save someone - the contract window never showed a contract available.  Clicking every button, opening and closing the menu multiple times yielded the same results.  Only after a relog, followed by opening the contract window and leaving it alone for 20+ seconds did the contract show up in the list.  Then, once it showed in the list, I couldn't accept the contract.  Lag? Who knows, but I was extremely frustrated.  Thinking I did something wrong, I started messing with other options in the station window, leading to...2) After exiting the shipyard my spaceship loaded about 20 ship lengths away from the station, then autopiloted itself again toward the docking area...but then it would freeze in a hover over the pad as if it tried to dock but didn't finish the action.  Nothing I could do at that point, undock was greyed out, so was refit ship, etc.  The mission kept prompting me to undock by flashing the button.  Someone in chat suggested I use the emergency warp feature so I tried that, then...3) After the emergency warp, out of nowhere, the contract apparently accepted itself then completed itself, and I got 10 grain for no reason.  I don't even know what the contract wanted me to do, because I never got to accept it in the first place due to bugs 1 and 2.  Now it's complete by itself...odd.  Then, the ship autopiloted itself to the SS again, got hung up trying to land, again...4) After multiple relogs, exiting out and coming back in, it would load up and do the same thing - I would either be outside of the SS and it would autopilot me in and get hung up, or i would be sitting on the pad but with the same greyed out buttons preventing me from doing anything.  About one in 5 emergency warps would let the autopilot take me all the way in and properly dock at the station.  Once finally properly docked, bug 5 finally broke the camels back:5) I had to use the help feature to look up what I was even supposed to be doing with that grain... it said I was supposed to sell it to the station for 5000 credits.

								This is the second game I randomly found on Steam that I've never heard about but is actually fantastic. A True sandbox space (I don't even know how to classify the type of game this is because it feels like we can do anything we want... explore, trade, colonize uncharted planets, improve yourship for combat, etc).  My ship's on board computer has a commandline that allows us to set parameters (quite frankly this was totally unexpected for me, and it adds to the cool factor for me).  There is trade, there is massive exploration opportunities, probably more starsystems than will ever possibly be explored even if this game is around for 20 years.  100s of billiions of stars out there, and we can set up a colony and our own space station eventually.  I'm impressed.  This game appears to have all the features I've always wanted in a space game, and I was shocked at how easy it is to get the hang of.  Although I heard from others using the interstellar communications that the further along we are in the game the more complex it gets.  So I asked them that even if it gets complex can I just still choose to explore, and be mellow.  They said yes this is a sandbox.  They said we could just do the tutorial and take it as slow as we want.  Also it was a nice suprise that ships do not expend energy unless you use hyperdrive to travel to stars without a jump gate.  I also couldn't wreck my ship by crashing into the space station (which was nice since I didn't realize all I had to do was use autopilot to dock my ship).  In any case this is totally up my alley since I don't like micromanaging fuel while still learning a game.  We can keep flying from station to sation, mine, land on planets explore without fear of crashing and blowing up, or running out of fuel until we are ready to go out and take on more deadly stuff.  I don't know folks but this game seems like it is like a real universe.  I read all that stuff on the website about the graphics needing to be better and stuff, but I'm impressed at how immersive this game is and the graphics aren't an issue with me at all.  It also said they were working on improving combat (I honestly haven't tried combat yet, but the list of controlls seem simple enough).  This is still just early access so I totally don't expect this to be feature complete, but my goodness I'm glad I got this game!  I definitely recommend, and I'm not some long term fan boy that is biased about this game.  I really think this is a good find.			"

I,ve got Elite Dangerous and quite frankly it bores me. Ascent may not have AAA graphics but it makes up for it with gameplay.			"

								Ok. This game is in developement, so this is first and formost an attempt to contact, and work directly with the developer. I have real life pilots training, and a real technical background. I would like to work with you as a vollunteer tester... I see so much potential here. I have a decent PC, and a Saitel X-52 PRO HOTAS, a BELKIN N52te gaming pad, a excellent gaming keyboard, and a CORSAIR MMO gaming mouse... If you work with me I will send you regular, clearly written, and absolutly coherent reports on each patch or fix you have me implement. I am supporting you with the purchase of this space-sim in progress, support me back by allowing me to help with the developement of this simulation, and I think the Sky will not even be the limit... Some developers ignore offers like this, other take offers like this sincerely, and they end up producing works like IL-2 Sturmovik 1946, or The Witcher Series !  After looking at the graphics creativity that has gone into this already, I am guessing you are the type of Producer & Programmer, that never looks a gift horse in the mouth... Hope to hear from yo soon !			"

								Very Indepth game with a steap learning curve and alot of work left to be done on the game itself. Luckily the community is very kind and helpfull. Also, from time to time the Developer shows up in chat which gives you a chance to chat directly with him :-DBeing able to slowly explore the galaxy of over 270 Billion star systems and explore each procedurally generated planet moon gas giant and star as well as take all kinds of surveys and then eventually choose a location to start your own colony where you then must build and manage your colony as well as transport goods to and from it in order to grow and expand is AWESOME :-D  Theres so much more to this game that just that too.I Would recomend watching a few of the Gameplay videos available on Youtube and trying the game for free on the Ascent website before buying the game, as the learning curve is daunting, but if your into this sort of thing, you will Love this game :-D			"

								A few weeks ago I was looking for a new game and came across Ascent. I don't regret it for a second. This game is excellent!  Being in early access I wasn't sure what to expect.  Features such as space exploration, farming and mining on planet surfaces, lots of trading (my favorite), NPC missions, asteroid mining and more make this sandbox pve game really enjoyable. You can construct your own star bases, research and manufacture items and colonize planets (IM not there yet). The game also has a player government system and you can have star systems named after you. Players construct jump gates which i think is amazing. The in game community is very helpful and friendly and strive to keep the game community driven. This isn't a pvp type game where players only think of themselves at the expense of others. The communities strength is in the common goals. The dev is working like a mad man to improve the game, and the updates are constant. So I highly recommend this game and for those critical of current game features such as the graphics or UI, I say be patient its early days. There's many more features and game improvements incoming.			"

								FREE DEMO AT THE GAME'S HOME PAGE: thespacegame.com Insanely addictive.  (I've played 50 hours a week on average since it arrived on Steam!)This is basically Eve Online without the constant weight of PvP. It's really just build and trade at a massive scale. + Great community+ 1 developper (+1 recently hired artist) working on the game, who cares about this game like it's his infant daughter.+ Deep gameplay, but not too hard to learn, there's great documentation.+ The scope of the game is immense. - there's only 1 developper, so the UI is missing finesse, and there's a number of minor bugs and inconveniences- Combat isn't really in the game yet. If you're looking for a space shooter, this isn't it.- the wealth and advantage of older players seems impossible to catch up to. "

								To anyone who has ever played Eve online but disliked the PVP aspect of the game... I recommend that you try this game.When you buy the game via steam you get 3 months premium bundled with your purchase.  This ""premium"" enables you to  build a colony outside the ""inner 9"" which is what the central hub of the game is called.  And several other things.My suggestion is to not activate your premium untill you have played a while, as it is not required untill you get into the later stages of the game.The game is under constant development.  Jam, the dev is constantly updating the game. (I think he never takes a break.)  Most patches are small, in the 8mb size range.The graphics are really good and constantly being updated and expanded.The Gameplay... It is so extensive that I probably have not experienced 20% of what you can achieve.  My experience has so far been mining, trading and doing contracts.  There are colonies and settlements, but I only have a single Settlement from the tutorial missions.The gameplay is progressive.  As you get a bigger ship the contracts and items available to you also increase.I am someone who likes to read about the bad points of a game as well as the good points of a game...  So i will try and point out some bad things as well. :PCons : There are bugs still in the game.  - Some contracts do not accept correctly.- Changing ships means you have to undock and dock again to update the ship info.- The start of the game is slow to get yourself some money...  The first mission outside the ""inner 9"" takes an age to earn the money for.- Purchasing your first few ships takes forever. :)- sometimes the autopilot button might not work, possibly requires a restart.- complex command system for computers.  (some may not get the hang of it easily.)But even the few cons are minor things, that Jam the dev is working on to fix.  Overall this game is well worth purchasing.  It has alot of potential.			"

The buildings, researching, developing and the economic side of things is pretty deep and entertaining.

								This game is great for anybody who liked sim city, railroad tycoon, capitalism or most other builder types games. In its current incarnation there is almost no player player conflict. The only possible conflicts would be over resources but the spawn rate is high enough and the number of locations great enough its not a issue.This game allow you to build your own starbase and colony and explore. but you won't do it all today. Even if you had an infinite amount of resources behind you things take time to build and be researched.For those thinking about purchase some great guides have been written by the comunity.An example is the videos by sinstrite and  waevyrn which you can watched from stea. I've watched most of them and the present a reliable snapshot of the game in its spring 2015 form. Further development is planned so I fully expect those guides to be outdated by summer			"

You can basically do wattever you want, anything you've desired from just watching a series such as Star Trek or the Star Wars movies; from the warping system to mining to trading to exploring to investigating and in the future the red zone for those interested in PvP action (Not myself particullary). Ascent have many things to offer you and I can assure you, It is worth every peny and probably more; don't doubt anymore on buying... We'll meet at space!			"

								Ascent The Space Game. Look at the games Ive bought. This is the only one. I usually do not come to steam to buy games.This one with the demo months agoprior to steam convinced me to come to steam just to pick it up. I played World of Warcraft, Eve and other mmo type games. Ive beta tested them as well.  Its dev crew is small 1 developer 1 artist. But if the Dev hires more we are looking at the  Makings of the next big Space MMO.  Currently PVE only but will include pvpin 1/3 of the galaxy at a later date which is fine by me.Pro's___AddictiveGreat Economic System in place - Player drivenGreat CommunityGreat Progression systemCheap Sub - $3 a month gets you everythingCheap Start Price (even at 19.99 Ive gotten 189 hours so far)You do not need to sub get most content upto late game.Con----It is a work in progressIt can feel grindy. But yet still rewarding Graphics Are being worked on.Ui needs an overhaulOverall I rate it a 9 of 10 for early access and Definitely Recommend it.			"

								First impression: Feels like a crossover of Frontier and Freelancer. Nice to be able to land on planets and to build colonies on them, but blueprints for colony structures does not come cheap for a newbie, so that isnt available right away.Systems outside the primary sector are built by players and you hear talk about building jumpgates  and other things in the chat, to get outside the jumpgate system you need a hyperdrive. As for PvP, there is talk of a redzone and concentual PvP. Premium access is dirt cheap, availalble in several types of gameplay modes (Planet, Industry, Combat) and can be bought on Steam, 6 months + 1 year subscription should be added since it is so cheap.

Posted: April 25, 2016
												I've had to re-evaluate my review over the last few days.  I've steadily been getting more and more addicted.  Yes, this game has PLENTY of bugs.  Yes, there are things in it not feature complete coming out of early access.  Yes, it is VERY rough around the edges graphically and UI wise.  But it is still attempting something that no other space game has done to date, and with only 1 guy developing it.  So I must preface my main points with this: If you can't handle bugs that cause the game to crash, delete your colony buildings, or cause your fps to drop below 20 due to memory leaks, DO NOT play this.  You will rage quit.I'm still learning the intricacies of this game.  But it's fairly massive in scope.  You will spend many hours learning how to build colonies and work on your personal starbase.  If you follow the tutorial you should be fine.  The game needs alot of work even coming out of early access.  You will get glitchy graphics here and there.  Pirate AI vessel's will usually glitch out and constantly ram your ship, making it easy to dispatch them because they just keep moving forward in front of you and not shooting their weapons.  So yeah, shooting them is really easy when they're a foot in front of your nose.This game was made to build colonies and starbases with.  It has a HUGE universe.  Something like 250 billion planets.  Each new system you warp to is procedurally generated.   You can land on all the planets in the game.  Something that Elite Dangerous doesn't have yet and wont have for awhile.  So keep in mind what I said.  This game was made to build colonies on planets.  The rest of the game isn't fully fleshed out yet.  If you want to make money, buy a bigger ship, strip it, and just mine asteroids all day or collect gas from outer bases, then sell.  Combat will get you some decent money as well because the ships are glitched right now and pose very little threat.This game is a carebear game.  You can't lose your ship or die, ever.  If your health gets too low, the ship computer auto warps you out of the combat area.  You don't even fight other enemy ships unless you're in ONE particular system.  So taking all that into consideration, you can tell the developer wanted this to be a colony crafting space game with some minor combat content.  You have various skills that improve with use.  I love this skill system and wish more MMO's used it.  The better the skill is, the more money you'll make while doing that activity.  Unfortunatly combat doesn't have any skills as far as I can tell.  Only gas harvesting, mining, trading and colony maintenance.  The colony system is very in depth.  Crafting buildings on planets comes with alot of maintenance on your part.  The people will need food stores and other various activities to maintain morale.  On the flip side, the colonies will produce resources for you.  You can land on your colonies and the colonies of others, get out of your ship and do things like take soil samples, visit another players nightclub or bar and recruit NPC's to fly your ships for you, etc.  Colony expansion is the reason to play Ascent.  It IS the endgame.  Ascent is primarily all about colony construction and building outer starbases throughout the universe to expand the dwindling human race.  Outer planet colonization is much differant than inner 9 colony maintenance.  Think of the inner 9 planets as the starting worlds all noobs visit to learn the game.  Outer planets require environmental domes to sustain life on them, unless they have oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere, otherwise, they are like any earth like planet.All the jump gates in game were created by other players.  So if you want to explore, you need a hyperdrive.  So the player base is pretty nice from what I've seen and help players get hyperdrives for cheap.  THere are players here that have played Ascent for over 2 years now.  So the jump gates are pretty common in the core worlds.   The dev is planning on implementing pvp in a certain zone and that's all.   This game, again, is primarily to avoid gankers.  So if you're coming here from Eve Online and want to screw with people, you won't get that chance here. This game has a few broken features, like combat.  So the only other thing to do to make money is trade carbon from one system to another.  Making money is soooooo easy once you get to a class 8 or 9 ship. You will be making upwards of 92 mil/hr just trading from one system to another. It's ridiculously easy. I'm in a class 13 ship at the time of this review, and am making 3 billion credits per hour hauling carbon.  The game turns into a time waster grinding money for hours to get a bigger ship to make even more money.  Like I said above however, this game is all about rebuilding humanity one colony at a time.  So the players base is supposed to work together to build bases and colonies on all the planets and build star gates so travel is easier. That, is end game.  My review/impression video:

For now, it's a 'No' for the time wasted after trying really hard to progress in it for a week and just being shut out.**UPDATE**The issue has been fixed in my case within 24 hours or less.

								Absolutly Fantastic game I've got it yesterday, played it all day' the community is astonishing and everyone helping eachother out I was givin a nice starting ship curtouisy of another very generious player, all my questions were answered on how to play and what and which does what. The only thing I haven't done yet is colonize a planet to make some more $$$.Overall the Graphic Design is spectacular, the game engine of course uses Unity 5 thats an automatic 10/10 on Optimization the game is very well developed and honestly I do fancy it more then Eve Online it's much better and more competitive to eve only set in a PvE Universe so that way each and every player can have fun and play the way they want to enjoy themselfs and there gaming experince playing.Theres a few kinks here and there small stuff you wouldn't averagly Notice but since the game is still in heavy development of course it's going to be fixxed, the ammount of time that went into this game by 1 man is amazing and sure to have taken alot of time to create a master piece like this' I'm extremely happy I spent the 19.99$Bottom Line, Fantastic Game, Great Graphics, Smooth and Fun Gameplay, Tons of Exploration to be done in a real lifelike size of the Milky way, I've never givin a game a personal 10/10 or a 9/10 before but for Ascent....9/10 - Stright up.

								Was going to write a Review on the game at 100 hours game play, Reached that within the week and still had not scratched the surface of this amazing game so decided to try it at 500 hours, oops got lost in the game. For a handful of people making this game it truely is amazing. There is plenty to do within the game and you dont have to sit on a set path to enjoy it. Dont feel like hauling goods?, go kill some npc ships. Dont want to explore?, build up your own base, Dont want to salvage ship parts off wrecks?, go mine asteroids that move and turn around your space-ship. Speaking of ships the different ships and carrying capacity is mind blowing for an alpha game, zip around in a 6 direction mini-frigate or carry tens of thousands of tonnes of materials in a freighter, trading with friends or npc's around the galaxy.Like shiney objects? there are about 270Billion of them! all ready to be explored. The graphics although not as refined as the blockbuster type games are still impressive.The community is very vibrant and helpful with many of the players spending over 1000 hours logged there is a wealth of knowledge there.This is a sandbox mmo meaning its not how the game wants you to play but how you want to play the game!TLDR; Great game too much time typing, must get back and play it!

								Great game so far. Nice and helpful community. If you ever played X2: The Threat you will have no problem learning this game I don't think. Very similar influence. Graphics are fine, maybe not like Eve, but they are decent enough to be enjoyable. Tutorial is helpful for learning various core aspects of the game. Mining is actually much more fun than other space sims. Mostly this game is about the community and working together to achieve goals in the game. I am not sure if there is any combat yet or PvP but this is EA and there will be some added soon in certain sectors to create some conflict regarding resources and such, but will be optional. This game focus more on PvE factors and repopulating the universe with industry, trade, and manufacturing. It is a relaxing game, a little on the light side of adventuring, but there is plenty to do: missions, trading, hauling, exploring, building, settling, colinization, and eventually bounty hunting pirates and such. Hope to see you there!Edit: Okay so there is combat now but it is still in a prototype phase and will be worked on.			"

								Grate Community People are willing even Eager to Help. Point out Help on both the Wiki and In game. Will Offer you Discounted Ships, Materials, and As Much Help as You can Want. the Only Short comming that I have seen so far is that the Game is still in Alpha. But for this Game that Is a Pluse Because when the games if Full Anyone in the Early release will be Far Ahead of People that Buy after release. that Does not Mean that the People that wait will be Shorted, it just Means they will not have the Knowlage that the Early release People Have.If you want a Non PVP (so far ) Space Game that Is about Community and Having Fun then this is the Game you want!!Great PVE ( Player vers Envioment ), Many Helpfull Players, Great Help in game and Wiki. Then BUY this Game!!! "

												Awesome game with lots of potential, the controller support sucks but nothing a little fiddling in DS4Windows (or one could use JoyToKey or Pinnacle) wasn't able to fix.  The tutorial is not very helpful and I'm kind of stuck trying to get enough money for a warp drive, but I've been checking back occasionally to watch this game grow.Really hoping for better controller support and a more readable interface, the text is way too small for me since I like to play on my couch on the living room TV.

								This game is about exploring space. It is an open universe sand box type of game that allows you to build bases, space stations and much more. This game is also online and seemingly from what I saw in the chat, players are attempting to make groups or factions. Hopefully this results in war.... Also there is fighting on the side of this game's mechanics. So far I find this game pretty interesting. At times it may become a little boring but thats ok.

								Ascent shows a tremendous amount of potential and can give the space lover long-term fulfilliment. Even the most mundane tasks (minning for minerals) has a tranquil and addictive charm. Seeing your ship size grow and future worlds, leads you down the rabbit hole in an impressive way. As more features are introduced, this game is set to become a glassic in the space exploration genre and who knows, maybe the spiritual successor of Eve online. The community seems helpful even if the interface is clearly rough around the edges yet. Hearing your credits increase as you sell valuable commodities, feels strangely fulfilling. The Dev is mature and responsive to feedback and ever helpful. More video tutorials are popping up making the learning curve more bearable. The wiki is impressive and this game is just one of those hidden indie gems that don't come around very often. I highly recommend you try it and take a look!			"

								Its early access but core systems are set up and running.Seems to be alot of player feedback taken into consideration.One guy (and now an artist) are doing the whole game.Seen several updates since I started playing, but none that seemed to be extremelty noticeable.Very much a community game too where people cooperate to fulfil major objectives (which for now is building warp gates to far away systems).Game still has alot of crashes and random lag fests (3 FPS cycle) but its still in an alpha state. But performs better than most alpha tests I have seen.Huge potential if the funding comes which will rely on the game getting better coupled with the hardcore supporters who have been there for awhile.

												Great Game so far!No PVP, Yay! I can go mine, build colony, explore, etc..and not have to worry about being PKed by others with much better equipment. It seems so many games now have this PK to win built into them. For a casual player, there is no way to keep up. Not in this game though. None of that here..just fun!This game is about building things alone or with others, not destroying things, and killing defenseless players, like so many other games are now. Very refreshing and relaxing to play.The community has been very, very helpful. If you have a question, you just ask in the ""Help"" channel. Do not forget to help others in that channel too. Chat is mostly very possitive, and not intentionally misleading, or filled with Trolls as other games today are.If you put in the effort to accomplish, you will.The subscription rate for Premium is very cheap. Think it is US $2.95 a month, give or take a penny or twoIf you want a PVP/PK game, this game is not for you, you will not like it, as I would not like the PVP/PK game you would like. Different strokes for different folks they say.Come play! Form your own oppinion. Have fun!!			"

								I have almost 2000 hrs of gametime.HOW TO DESRBE? A very UNIQUE game. Openended. Co-operative. Build immense starbases and colonies. (i do mean immense with hundreds of thousands of individual buildings) discover billions of systems with planets and asteroids and stars of every type. How you play is up to you. Make billions of credits, Build huge empires. Fly huge ships. Have NPC's fly others for you.Smuggling and PVP and bounty hunting and assasinations coming.Be a miner and make billions.Skim gas giants for fuel and materials.Build shipyards and be a ship builder.Be a govenor, senator, mayor, or even president.Help decide the direction of the game. Your opinions are heard.DLC is available but totally not needed to play the game. Mostly for nostalgia and prestige.Get lost in space and build huge colonies and bases on your way across the galaxy., or build up close to civilization and create a vast trading empire.the game is vast enough that everyone on the planet could own a few systems of their own.If you are the type of guy that likes to get with a few buds and one shot miners passing by, there is a game but it probably never will be this one. PVP Combat will be limited to areas and will only be between people that want to fight. That is a paraphrased quote from the developer. Combat seems to be shaping up to be something that will be a little more deliberate, not a quick one shot.PVE may be more widespread but i doubt it will be a serious threat.Go read the forums, watch videos on the game, read the wiki.

												Ascent has some really awesome potential, despite a few challenges, and a steep learning curve to deal with at the start, it's a fantastic PvE Space game.  Spend some time on the wiki getting started to really have good traction.  While premium is available, it isn't needed until much later in the game.  Help channel always seems to have helpful people in it.  I love the game, and recommend it.  I've played many hours, and think I""ve more than gotten my money back out of the game!Downsides:* Still some bugs in the game; be willing to work with it.* A lot to take in... do you trade, farm asteroids, scoop gas, develop planets, setup domes, build your space station.  LOTS to get involved with, and it takes time to understand.* Tutorial quests can be tough; especially finding salvage.  It's space, and space is BIG!			"

If you want more than a space shooter, if you want more than a ""civ space"", give this a spin and find the best community in gaming. The story behind this game is as improbaly awesome as the game itself. Be warned: this is a great game for the in depth player who wants to build an empire spanning starsystems, but it's also a ""dive in, dive out"", so you're had either way.

												Awesome game, imaging EVE Online Light Version vs The EVE Online now we have who is Dark Version.In Ascent, you get to mine, craft, research, trade, build settlements, colonies, starbases, you get to explore new unknown systems, discover asteroid fields, claim planets for yourself. There is no PVP right now but the dev is working on it and with time you will have sectors dedicated for PVP protecting those players from PVP in other sectors. So the PVE crowd will be pleased, the game has still a long way of improvements and the devs are always working to fix the bugs. There is an option to play the game for free after buying it here and then is the other option to subscribe for like $3 a month that gives you more freedom int he building of colonies and Star bases. Give it a try you will not be disappointed. I give this game a 9/10			"

This ain't it!If you want a game that is going to tax you mental abilities in deciding how, and where to explore, and colonize... Keep reading.The universe is so large that I set out to find the edge. I honestly do not think it is possible. It has a little something for everyone. Mining astroids, wheeling and dealing in the Stock Markets. Running cargoes to and from various worlds. Combat too, it still lacks some polish and shine but you can see, if your willing to tough it out, this is going to be big.It is a completely open world. Go wherever you what! Do whatever you want! Buy, sell, farm, craft, Terraform a planet just for yourself, but be careful and don't tell everyone, because they could swoop in and reap the benefits of your hard labors.My dislikes are... Not a lot because I understand it is VERY early release. I was kind of bummed about lack of instruction, and that everyone in chat would just say ""Go Check The Wiki."" or ""There is a thread on the forums about that."" But over the last few days, that has gotten a lot better.

								I would recommend this game to anyone that likes space exploration, building colony's and or star bases.  This game is heavy on the player economy and is probably one of the best I have ever seen for player driven economys.   Currently there is very limited PVE however it is being revamped as I type this and should be awsome when released just like the rest of the game.  The game is in early access and is still being worked on which means some things are still limited like types of ships. However the games depth considerably out weighs anything the game is lacking. The community is awsome as well the peeps in ATSG are awsome.  The biggest negative I can say is on the UI,  the UI is not user effecient and there are alot of commands for the game aspects that you have to type in manually or make whats called an alias for the command.  All and All though it is an awsome game and I would recommened it to anyone that likes space games.  The game can be a lil over bearing at first but the ppl in ATSG are always willing to help :P			"

								Terrible alpha version of a space sim. Maybe has potential. Check back in a few years.			"

												Not worth the $19.99, don't buy unless you like being disappointed. It looks like something made in half an hour; it really explains the file size.1/5			"

								It's eve online from 1999. Its clunky, the UI is terrible.Think second life in space.I have never played a game where the combat between two ships made me so angry that I had to go do push ups. 'pew' 'pew' 'pew'. Mouse to steer WHILE holding left click. Lord have mercy.			"

								I wish I could get a refund for this awful game. I lost patience with it after about 2 hours of play. It does nothing that I tell it to do, for example: I agree to a contract where I have to deliver 10 mining robots to 3 seperate colonies. So I dock with a space station and buy 10 mining robots .... so where are they? It tells me i'm carrying NO cargo! I repeat again and again, but to no avail. Next I accidently unfit the warp drive from my ship, I try to refit it and ..... nothing! Now I'm stranded and can't go anywhere or do anything. So I give up and try to exit the game .... nothing to click on to exit, I have to open task manager to stop the game running. I know it's early access, but this game is an unplayable waste of money!!			"
