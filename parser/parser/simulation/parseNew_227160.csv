												It took me several hours and several visits to the forums to unravel Kinetic Void.  Once I deciphered it I saw enough promise in the idea to purchase a second copy for a friend.The game was flawed but it was Early Access. Lots of things didn't work as expected.  Some things didn't work at all.  There was little correspondence between the sparse documentation and game play.   I put the game's developement somewhere between late Alpha and early Beta.  Then, almost without warning, Kinetic Void went to full release.  The broken parts were still broken.  The unfinished parts were still unfinished.  The devs claimed they had delivered what they had promised but that they would clean up the remaining rough edges.Several months  later the edges are still as rough as they were at _release_.Ship building works well enough but there is a lack of detail.  All components engines, turrets, hull, weapons have a generic, unfinished feel.  The mission system doesn't work but combat mostly does work.  Trade & inventory management are overly complex and nearly indecipherable.   Movement & control work but the interface is inconsistent.The Devs are a small team.  Apparently there are only three of them yet theyconsistently  have ignored offers of help from the community.Perhaps it's project burn-out.  Perhaps the devs will find a second wind and, with a mighty effort,  put a playable game together.  I wouldn't count on it.Put your money somewhere else.Two sad thumbs down.			"

												I bought this game a while back looking for a fun space sandbox and was highly dissapointed. Given that it was early access I decided I'd wait a bit, see if they managed to turn it into something actually worth playing. Well it's been a while since then, and guess what? Not at all what they promised... The only improvements they've made were incrimental or pointless. Moreover, the devs have attempted to silence negative reviews on numerous occasions. This is poor development and shady buisness and it's dispicable. Seriously, I want a refund but I know I won't ever get one... these devs plain lied to their customers. Don't buy this game!			"

												Just went and played it after many months of giving it a miss due to lack of content. First starting up the game I get a 'tutorial' box saying ""We should never see this message!"". I click to continue to find out the button is inactive. After seeing that, as far as I'm concerned, this is not a 1.0 worthy product, and it is certainly not a 'game'. Can I have my money back, please? You guys are almost as deluded as the guys who made Starforge.UPDATE: The♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥have even disabled comments on their update announcements because of all the (understandable) hate they're recieving.

												Backed this game for 50 bucks on Kickstarter. Almost 3 years later its still a horrible game. The shipbuilder was pretty nice. But thats pretty much the only enjoyable part of the game. Also runs pretty choppy on high end PC's. Cant believe they actually released this as a finished product, but I guess they just gave up and got tired of working on it. Also massively overpriced. You can get X3: Albion Prelude, a very superior game for 10 bucks. Had a lot of hope for this game, just another Kickstarter let down. (Nov. 22, 2014)			"

												DEVELOPER NOPE - Try the X series instead (minus Rebirth).TL;DR version:  This is a case where the developer literally took the money, padded their Steam library full of games to work hard on ""developing"" and then after the rest of the team QUIT the lead developer used the remaining money to start up a physical game store in a mall while LYING to those who bought KV that there was no more money for development - check the bottom image for a good list of why this game's development died to be Spacebased from Early Access.Somehow, my hours played got reset despite checking the game out when it had promise (I actually had to boot it again and checked out the minor additions since this title was given the ""Spacebase 1.0 Treatment"".  It was obviously pushed out too early considering part of the ""finished game"" has ""(Not currently implemented)"" placeholders.  Development was chugging along, albeit slow, but most folks knew that when they were getting into the game...and could forgive that easily.The main problem isn't the gameplay to be found in the game, as it has a decent foundation with a ship builder and more (almost like a 3D Drox Operative)...but outside of that, there really isn't much to the game still, and unfortunately due to developer meltdown there probably never will be. This is another Early Access dud where they slap a 1.0 on it (to cash in on the sales that might generate...which it did not), expect the community to finish it, then spend time making excuses about how Steam wouldn't allow them to put it back into the Early Access program while lashing out at their customers for not crowdfunding someone's dream and being happy about the results when it was prematurely released with poor communication surrounding it.That is exactly what LumberingTroll (developer) did, and when people pointed this out in a thread asking if the game was still being developed - after the dev wasn't communicating with the community shortly after the ""Spacebase Treatment"" of slapping a 1.0 on a title then bailing to start up a physical game store without letting those following the game know what was going on in dev plans - LumberingTroll called everyone ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" and then deleted the thread when it appeared that he might have to face responsibility for his own actions.Yes, apparently game developers - the REAL Steam customers while everyone else is supposed to be happy with poor faith business practices - are allowed to break the Steam posting rules whenever they feel like it and can only be held ""responsible"" by deleting the incriminating evidence from the virtual sandbox Steam gives them to do whatever to the ""lesser customers"" - also known as ""marks"" - only when it embarrasses them.The problem with that is that people were otherwise mostly forgiving up until the ""Spacebase Treatment"" and the childish forum whitewashing.You thought you had a problem with ""bad reviews"" before, LumberingTroll?You just gave people reason to write more.Maybe next time you'll bother to treat your customers in the same respect you wish to be treated, but until this developer does some serious reparations I would suggest to avoid the developer's dysfunction at all possibilities.  Those antics changed my position from a silent ""wouldn't recommend until it becomes more complete"" to a ""until this developer removes their head from their backside, continuing to pay attention to them might in itself deserve a refund"".LumberingTroll:""You are all being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and this is why most developers refuse to reply on forums. KV was released early, yep, nothing new ive said that before. Valve wont let me put it back in early access so there is nothing I can do about that. KV isn't generating money, I cant put funds into its development right now, I work on it when I can in my spare time. I am hoping we (the two people still at the company) can put out a small project to generate some revenue to fund development. Like it or not the game is as it is for now. I'm sorry some of you feel your $5 - $20 was wasted. If you guys dont want to be civil I'll gladly just avoid the forums from now on like most developers do.""Blame the customer?  The customer writes reviews to that effect.Edit 26 Apr 15:  Screenshot of developer banning someone for reporting the developer's comment for being in violation of the Steam Rules:  http://imgur.com/nyzSXdjScreenshot of developer asking for feedback about why customer reviews were so negative: http://i.imgur.com/EmJ9cPV.pngSomeone gives the developer this info (long after the dev bailed from the title except for excuses), to which the developer disagreed enough that they deleted the entire thread:http://i.imgur.com/8vcRzdl.pngEdit 30 Nov 15:  LT continues his practise of whitewashing the forum of his misdeeds, namely running off to go start a physical game store after expanding his game library and his own KS backings substantially a bit after the Kickstarter, while those who point this out whenever LT plays up the ""barely able to scrape by starving developer"" farce get permabanned and purged from the forums:http://imgur.com/0P092rkHere is an article describing where the remaining funds for developing KV went to:http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/business-journal/2015/08/11/badland-games-caters-board-game-players/31505761/ "

												I bought and backed this game 2 years ago, when it was in fledgling alpha state. My first Early-release, too.I was an active part of the community at the time, doing screenshots and showing off ships, complementing eachothers' ships, writing guides, giving feedback to the developers.6 months later I grew tired of the slow updating (as well as the game) so I stopped playing it as actively as I once was. 3 months after that I stopped completely.I patiently waited for new updates that came once per 3-4 months at a time sometimes, and briefly brought myself to speed with how things were.Then they began to rush the release. I could tell because they suddenly sped up the alpha states faster than the content actually generated. From .022 to a .#, and then to simply d.#, like they were trying to rename the process to give the illusion of progress. Then the release came. I, like many other backers, was immensly disapointed with the game.While real progress was made in these 2 years, the progress could have easily fit into one year. Don't get me wrong, the shipbuilder is GREAT. Or, at least last time I checked.But then you're in space. It can get really laggy, and there isn't much to do. I don't mind having all the lore of the universe in your head, but developers promised economy systems, intricate faction mechanics, ect. Nothing is intricate.Even if this was still in alpha I would give a shaky reccomendation at best. Progress was slow, but continuing.But this 'release' gives me the feeling that this game is rather a let-down.Sorry, but I'm disappointed.			"

												No. Start setting is what is unfortunately quite common in certain Early Access Games -> a EA Game abandoned/Developer not seen around for a long time and then there was a casual discussion about the game in the otherwise quiet forums and topic was the games content and it's development history.  no flaming no nothing. just pondering over how things could have been and what was completed and talk about how to play the working parts of the game to get the best out of the game. And then suddenly there is a ban. Developer resurrected himself from the dead to just do this ban without a written warning or reason and nothing more. And then he returned to the bottle it seems.  No way to know what the problem was or chance to edit things. Just a permaban. No Ban reason just a reference to rules. Well read the rules but no rules was infringed - how could they have been infringed as the discussion was quite neutral and non-accusatory. No finger pointing or anything just talk about how things could have been and still a ban. And a permanent ban too. For good. For me this is the first time i have ever been banned in ANY forums as hateful speech is something i simply will not do. So i hereby use my right to tell people to stay out. I understand banning flame or hateful speech but this? No. just No. Just keep out. There is nothing to see here. I refuse to even comment on the game itself as it has some pretty solid pro's too but since this is the way things are done around here then just staying out is the way to go. To the garbage bin this game goes. Good riddance. Enjoy the money you got for this dear dev. Enjoy it.			"

												After retrying the game today, for some reason, I decided to remove my previous review which had a very strong focus on the context of the game rather than the game itself. The recommendation remains negative though.The first thing you'll be asked to do when starting a new game is to choose a mode (career - which means you start with limited resources and have to acquire more to build bigger ships - and creation - which means you have access to nearly an infinite amount of parts). Sadly for the career mode there is only 3 starting option, start with a small fighter or a freighter and the last being no ship but with some random part in your stock which sometimes produce quite awkward results. You will then set the size of the galaxy and how many factions inhabits it as well as name it (this is actually your save).The core of the game is the ship design/building. You have several parts of several types which you can use and they come in various sizes (with some blocks shapes that are specific to a size or another). Once you build your ""hull"" and depending on how many parts of this or that type you set, you have space to put subsystems. Weapons are set on hardpoints which you also set by placing those weapon mounts. Overall the system is nice and as long as you remain in the hangar, lighting and controls are manageable.The UI is sometimes a bit annoying as you can get menus overlapping each others. To give an example, when you have the parts panel open and go to the shop, the parts panel has priority over the shop one which does not make much sense as obviously when you open the shop you ain't going to build your ship. Another example are the pop up windows when you place modules which may happen partially off-screen. Those are details and are easily sorted (as you can close the side panel of part directly or drag the windows) but it shows an unfinished or unpolished state of the game.Once you launch your ship, that is when the state of the game really shows. The first shocking thing that struck me is the lighting. While lighting is kind of realistic (light source = sun) and background is pretty dark (nebular clouds are also pretty dark) it often leads you to barely seeing your own ship or which direction she's headed.There are several promising features in this game, although it is difficult to get involved. Mining is the first thing I tried to do and while it is easy to grasp and do, it is not fun. You select an asteroid, warp to it at range, bring the context menu again to mine and then... well, you wait till either the asteroid is destroyed or your cargo is full. I returned to the station I came from by warping to it and hoped to find a docking option in the contextual menu while having it selected, but you have to manoeuver manually in the ""docking line"" first and then on approach you get to confirm you want to dock. Once docked with your cargo you of course hope to sell it. So first you need to transfer the cargo from your ship to the station and then you may trade it. When trading, you click on each goods and then select a quantity you want to sell. There are little option to accelerate this process like ""shift-click"" to sell all of a good.I won't detail combat or faction interractions here, although my overall experience of those features was that they were pretty bland. Of course I did not play enough in career mode to fully appreciate the content of late game like having tons of parts and a huge vessel for example. You can surely experience that directly with the creation mode, although my feeling is that if you're not solely an avid ship builder this will kind of work like a cheat and chances are that you will roll over everything else in the game once you launch your masterdesign and subsequently loose interest in doing anything else in the game very quickly (there is no story to uncover and generally speaking nothing that gives you a real sense of accomplishing anything anyway).As I said above regarding mining there is this feeling that the game does not make the player participate actively to the things he can do and at the same time make actions available to him sort of chores. It is not a that much of a bad game, but the unfinished state sadly end up with this product being mediocre (this is apparently explained by half the studio workforce, 2 on 4, having left the project). I would like to see it updated and apparently that is also the opinion of the remaining employees, but everyone's got to eat and I can't blame gamers for not buying this leading to the makers having to work on something that is actually economically sustainable.

												Kinetic void had shown promise when first announced. I have experimented with it's features at all stages of development, and was happy to see progress being made each time. However, as of this writing (Nov 22/2014) I would not recommend this game in it's current state. Many of it's systems still need some time in the oven, features are missing, and there is a lack of purpose or motivation in continued play. Shipbuilding is entertaining if you have a creative side, but not enough to keep me engaged. An excellent concept hindered by pushing this game out before it is ready. I'd hold off on buying this unless it's under a deep discount or after significant updates and patches.			"

												Don't even think about buying this game. Why? Because it's not a game. Simple as that. It's a half brewed ship builder with clumpy controls and that's about it. No content, no meaningful missions, simply nothing that provides a reason to build a ship in the first place. I was shocked, when I realized that this game has meanwhile left Early Access Status, because it is still in pre-alpha state. This is not a full release this can not even be considered as pre-alpha preview. I had many disappointing experiences with early access (Hack'n'Slash, Spacebase DF...), but this isn't only a unfinished game like the others but a total train wrack. Or as I said in the beginning, this is not even a game at all. Don't let yourself ripp of and look for something worth your time.			"

												I watched this title for a long time. Had it on my wishlist and finally decided to take the plunge.  What's here is the beginning of something that could be truly great.  But it's simply that.  The beginning.  The game feels like it is still in early development not full release.Pros + The ability to design your own ship+ Customizing the universe size and number of factions+ Controls aren't overly complicated like many of it's space contemporariesCons- The actual interface for designing your own ships is beyond complicated there is very little instruction.- The tutorial is sub-par- the ""Career"" mode seems like it is in it's infancy.- To much time where you are doing nothing but waiting (3 or so minutes to mine out a single asteroid)At THIS point I could not suggest this game to anyone unless they are willing to wait and see what the developers are going to do.  Make no mistake, this game may be in release but it is FAR from what any rational person would consider a ""release state""			"

Early Access Review
								UPDATED 7/8/2014Since a number of people were asking me to re-review the game in its current state, I finally relented and decided to try the game again.  These are my thoughts.  I find that many improvements have indeed been made.  This is to be expected, and very much welcomed.  I find that many of the features such as the shipyard and flight models have been improved with more easy-to-use controls and additional features.  A quick rundown of some of the key features and improvements I noticed:* Better inter/intra-system navigation and map* Slightly improved combat gameplay* Improved flight model and warp systems* Missions, Cargo, and semi-functional stores* Semi-functional ""career"" mode.  More on this below.Some things that are still issues:* Not developer's fault, but many workshop ships no longer function out-of-the-box due to creators failing to update them for new patches.* Overall, game still feels quite clunky and difficult to use.  Somewhat high learning curve unless you're wiling to read a lot.  >> Documentation has been improved.  Just be prepared for lots of reading.  * Crash to desktop is common.  Crashes more as your ship's # of modules increase>> Relatively decent auto-save means you won't loose too much progress.* See more belowThe game is still quite confusing and you often still don't even know what's going on.  There's still a lot left to be desired I think.Overall, the game has improved. Though I can't say that this is something to get especially excited about.  ""Why are you being such a debbie downer"" you ask?  Well, it's an alpha.  It is SUPPOSED to improve.  If it didn't, it's not worthy of even being sold.  I still do not recommend this game.  There is a ""But"" however... Here are my thoughtsMany critical features have been added and improved to a more usable state.  The warp mechanism has been tremendously improved.  The shipyard build system also deserves a mention as a vast improvement.  More customizability and more controls to fine tune your construction.  Though this can make things a bit more confusing to the new person or returning player, as with some of the other expanded features.  This is made up for with the improved documentation.  But beware, decent amounts of reading is required.  There are also some tweaks and improvements to the combat system.  It makes more sense but can still be awkward.  The galaxy map has also gotten a big makeover and is MUCH easier to understand.  There are many things that still are confusing and unfinished in this game.  The ""career"" mode is clearly unfinished and requires more attention.  From what I can tell, it's a misleadingly named ""survival"" mode at the moment.  However, it fails at that as well.  You have credits and the idea is to earn more through cargo or more ""illigitimate"" means. Basically, you start out by picking ANY ship from the workshop or stock selections.  No cost.  If you run out of money buying cargo to load into your mega-freighter you downloaded and didn't have to pay for, then just select any of the ship-part categories and sell any number of the ""999"" parts you somehow own from the start.  Just sell a couple Tier 5 weapons or ship bridges and you immediately have so much cash that the display has to use exponential notation (e.g. 1,000,000^E10).   Verdict:  Not recommended.  The game is still definitely unfinished.  There is not much polish. While there are a number of great improvements, I still cannot justify this game as a purchase.  It's confusing for new/returning players unless you're a quick learner or wanna read all the documentation.  Without developer input, I estimate this game is less than 50% done; though considerably more than the 6% quoted by the dev around the time of my original review 7 months ago.  My point still stands.  Do not buy the game unless you want to support the developer or really like the idea this game stands for.  It is playable now, so if you just really wanna get into space and do things, then go for it. I recommend waiting until a sale, however.  It is not worth $19.99 to me.  If it had a price-tag of about $10, it may be a good price if you're willing to put up with the downsides of a relatively mid-level-alpha.ORIGINAL 1/15/2014I don't recommend this game.  Yet.  If the features they have planned for this game come to pass, then this game will definitely be worth its price.   For now, I'd only recommend getting this on a Steam sale. This is a VERY early access with only a few of the main features added.  The building and customization functionality does have a lot going for it and has a lot of potential.  The rest of the game is still somewhat confusing, clunky, and still very clearly unfinished.My advice?  Wait a while.  Or buy this game simply to support development of the game.  Buying it to play it may end you up with some serious disappointment.  Don't get me wrong though, as I said, this game has potential.  As the developer stated in another negative review, this game is only approximately 6% finished.  Do not expect much from it.			"

												Was a promising game, got it cheap so I didn't care. I virtually shelved it in my library and waited patiently for good updates to come but they never did, and the game was released unfinished just to take off that 'early access' status so the devs can stop the mandatory updates. Although the game still appears to be being updated, and the devs have said so. But for me, it just doesn't feel right to release the game at it's current state. A few months of development could have benefited them, especially the ratings. Right now I'm seeing 56% Positive 44% Negative, thanks to enhanced steam. and that's not good.I don't blame the Early Access model, it's there for games like Kerbal Space Program, in which I would lose approx. 1000 hours of fun if the model hadn't existed. For games like Minecraft, Starbound, Arma 3, GalCiv 3, etcIn the future I would be more careful about buying early access games unless the ratings are 90% Positive and above, and the game is already feature complete, Thanks Enhanced Steam for that extra data!Update: Now I'm seeing 50% positive 50% negative, which has more negatives than on my original review, i think it has gotten worse			"

												Well, with 8 or so hours on record I feel like I can write a review on something quite a few other reviewers spent less than an hour on.Anyway, I agree with the general consensus: The ship builder side of the game is very functional, and the Workshop is full of awesome ships (and mechs even!) built by members of the playerbase that can be downloaded for your playthroughs. (After you fix them - don't forget the fact that a number of Workshop ships are technically incomplete, with not all of the subsystems set, and often with far too many subsystems than the other parts can handle. Too many hangar bays is a common example.) The learning curve for the shipbuilder is kind of steep, but like I said, quite functional.Outside of the shipbuilder, it's cool that you can set up a randomly-generated sandbox galaxy to mess around in according to some parameters that you set during generation - namely, galaxy size and number of factions. It gives a lot of play area, though there's no guaruntee your ship (even the workshop ones) will have the warp range to reach other parts of the galaxy. There are missions, pirates who nobody cares if you go hunting, and faction-relations mechanics - all of which are good.The thing is, outside of that it just feels bare. In 8 hours of play I've only encountered ""go hear and kill what you find"" missions. I haven't delved into the economy or career mode, true, but no ""sandbox"" should ever feel like there's nothing to do - and that's exactly how this game makes me feel. Sure, I can warp across the galaxy into pirate-held sectors and go to town with a downloaded Star Destroyer or HMS Warspite, sure I can rescue traders from pirate fighters and kill a smuggler or six, and sure it can be enjoyable all the same - I was giddy when I launched in my downloaded Super Star Destroyer and found it to be larger than the space station it was docked at, but all in all I can't really recommend this game. I bought it summer of last year, expecting it to improve in time, but it really doesn't seem to have gone anywhere. Whether or not the devs are still working on it behind the scenes I'm not really sure. I am sure though that this game has huge potential, but as it is now fails to live up to it. Right now all it's really good for is destroying everything you see. While enjoyable by itself, it gets old when you run into an enemy or 6 using the same ship as you, and that ship is some form of battleship which had until then slaughtered helpless foes. Especially when those enemies are pirates. I have limited hard drive space, and I am afraid that I'm going to have to uninstall to make room for other, more fleshed-out games. I might still come back to it eventually, see how it's changed (if at all). I just hope the potential here doesn't remain wasted.			"

Early Access Review
								Kinetic Void is a Space Sim game that currently, in it's Early Access stages, allows the user to create whatever space craft they desire and set out into space to see what piloting it would be like as well as pick fights with the local rabble for no reason other than you're toting 40 guns to their 6.Now, since this game is in Early Access, not a lot of it is in perfect working order and chunks of the game are as of yet unimplemented. Such things that aren't in the game yet include any form of story, a commerce system, weapons other than kinetic as well as differentations between weapons other than graphical models.However the development team behind Kinetic Void are working on the game at a decent pace and patches appear within a time span of 1-3 weeks between each other. It wouldn't be surprising to see the game toting more features a few months down the line.In the game's current state, it's great for anyone who wants to recreate ships such as Serenity from Firefly, The titular Battlestar Galactica or an X-Wing from Star Wars. And indeed, that is in it's own right an entertaining thing.As a result, I find that Kinetic Void is an entertaining video game that, even in it's unfinished and somewhat unstable format that it's currently in, is worth the admission price.If this review, nor any other review convinces you to obtain this game, or you're still unsure, there are plenty of videos of Kinetic Void on YouTube.

												I love the idea. I absolutely adore the intent of the game - its execution is horribly wrong however.The gameplay has struggled through the Early Acess with odd glitches here and there, and the end result isn't much removed from what it was before release.The game concept is a rather free-flowing gameplay mechanic to build your own starship, but the game's design is somewhat flawed on both balancing acts of manuverability vs firepower and basic instructions. This takes a whole other level just to explain how to play the game, and to be honest that isn't right for something like this. The basics of the game weapons are Lasers, Cannons and Missiles. Point-defense systems, cargo, salvage and mining are options for a ""career"" play to build up resources however the grind is long and boring. Ship movement is your typical thrusters and a hyperspace system to jump from point A to B faster, however when jumping you loose your perception on distance and its an annoying wait to see when the ship feels like ending the trip near the target. The shield is a more literal ""kinetic field Generator"" to protect the ship from damage, but limits movement. You go faster with it off, but take damge to the hull without a shield to cover your rear.To complicate matters the ship construction designs are done impressively free, able to freely rotate and adjust segments any combination you desire without distance restrictions or locking points - but it comes back to bite the design mechanic in how over-use of too many blocks can kill the gameplay performance. Some moderate limitations have been done to limit weapons and design, but it falls back to an inherit issue with the firepower and accuracy. There is no need for thinking small here, bigger ships, more power, shields and weapons will always do better. It makes any ammount of small craft obsolete and limits the gameplay feel - and punishes you for it as the ship becomes more sluggish with its size increasing. It makes the gameplay drag on in a rather negative way.I admit its a fun way to loose hours in it, crafting a unique ship - but you'll be so drained when done and after flying it for only short distances you'll not want to actually play with it much after.The game itself remains largely shallow in its build. No real story, gameplay or function - just create a random set of stars and factions/corporations and choose who you blow up basically. The faction loyalties shift freely with each fight, but it lacks heavily in the substance department for the actual game. No kind of character exists outside nameless portraits and your own nickname. In the basic Career mode you start with a small ship and grind up, but can just kick off in Sandbox to build whatever then just fly faster without the tedious grinding spree to build up to the big ship.It is a great concept, plenty of heart in it to be honest - but its end application feels lacking, and in a really big way. Pick it up if your really interested in its unique way of doing things, but be wary there isn't much here.			"

												Dreadful. It is really hard to say anything else to be honest. It is also equally hard to find the motivation to spend time writing a proper review for something that certainly is not a proper finished game. It is not a matter of it simply being in an unpolished beta or alpha state, it is the matter of it being, well, not a game yet. There is barely any gameplay to be had, core ui functionality is completely absent, and the gameplay on offer barely qualifies as more than a tech test.This would be fine, if said tech test was something new, something revolutionary, such as the Swarm tech test or if it had dynamic visual damage on the ships. If there was anything beyond the most barebones physics and graphics engine tech that has already been outdone 10 years ago or more, by games such as X2: The Threat (yes, i said X2, not X3).That is how antiquated this game already is, it is released in 2014 with features, gameplay and tech that has been outdone by games released 10 years ago.Then, on what basis could i possibly recommend this game? On the basis of it being an indie kickstarter project? No, it isnt good enough. If one starts to recommend and promote any indie project just for the sole reason of ""supporting the little guy"", we only betray ourselves as gamers and customers with basic consumer rights.There is nothing on offer in Kinetic Void that is better, or even equal, to games already on the market, indie or AAA.Many of the competitors even have a lower pricepoint, or have been in the bargain bin for years!This is not just about making games. Its about basic supply and demand.If other games have existed for 10 years that do everything this game wants to do, better, then there simply is no demand for this game. If there is no demand for this game, what was the point?The development time would have been better spent pursuing something else, because as of right now i cant possibly claim that Kinetic Void has anything of value to bring to the gaming scene what so ever.

The customization options for making your own ship were awesome......then they basically decided to not finish this game; feels like early-access abandonware to me. It's a shame because there is a lot of potential here.If you are hankering for this style of game might I suggest Starpoint Gemini 2 or Rebel Galaxy.			"

Early Access Review
								This is probably the most realistic space simulation I have ever played. You spend a really long time designing the perfect spaceship, equipped with high tech engines, weapons, cargo holds, medical bays, mess halls, crew quarters, and reactor cores. You believe you're prepared for anything space has to offer, whichso far, isn't very much. Akin to NASA, the Developers are going to need a lot more funding before anything new can be discovered in the final frontier.			"

												I truly wish there was a ""star"" system for steam instead of this ""NO"" or ""YES"" thumbs up black and white system steam has in place.If it did: 2.5 of 5 That being said I went with a no due to the simple fact this game was taken out of early release and sent into fullThis review is going to be written on five points’ gameplay, graphics, sound, story, replay ability.      Gameplay: So you build a ship with a wide array of parts, from tiny to massive in scale. To accommodate nearly anything you can think of, within reason, there are limitations. The shipyard tutorial is annoying and persists every time you go into a new game, divided into chunks of whatever aspect you are using the shipyard. Instead of leading you step by step to build a ship, which would have been better as it is easy to miss some things. Leaving you to fumble around on your own, which has its uses of course. I personally feel that is the better way to learn is through trial and error, but can see when this would be annoying. On the whole however the shipyard is pretty good and the only real issue is the tutorial. Once you leave the shipyard however is the real issue, missions are bland and boring. Collect this, kill that, I was hoping for planetary sieges or space convoys. The faction system is pointless at this stage, I saw a rival faction that owned more systems give money to the only other faction that was clearly there rival as they were engaged in a open conflict. Clearly some issues need resolution here. 	Gameplay: 2 of 5.      Graphics: Not terrible when the frame rate doesn’t stutter I’ll admit my system can’t run on ultra its true. But when it moves a high-medium for a while then slows to a crawl when more the five objects appear at once, not counting asteroids, ships and stations. Then Huston when have a problem. While textures look decent on some objects such as the lens flare from suns and ships. On planets they look half baked, while passable they could be better. And I’ve yet to find a nebula, so if they are even in here or not I don’t know but I’d hope they look better. In total the ships, asteroids and stations look good, fix the rest.	Graphics: 2.5 of 5     Sound: The music is catchy and epic but there’s only about three tracks so you’ll quickly grow board of them. Thrusters and gun fire is about the same sounds good on some weapons but again there’s only about a handful of sounds some that don’t match. Warp drive is nice though, loud boom followed by an annoying repetitive whir sound, that I swear sounds like one of mass effects loading screens.  On the whole they need to fix the ones they have and to add more sounds.	Sound: 2 of 5     Story: There isn’t one, I don’t know why I’m here, what I’m doing here or much of what’s going on…I suppose this might be on purpose, I e Mine craft in space or other such build your own story. But I’d like some content please.     Story: 1 of 5     Replay ability: Ok so this is the only real thing holding Kinetic voids head above water. IF, and I strongly stress if, you can look pass the whole issues in the game sound, story gameplay. Then you can kill a lot of time here building ships and sailing amongst the stars, tweaking ships, etc.Replay ability: 4 of 5 "

												I feel like there should be some sort of system in place for games that are abandoned by their developers like this. I get that it's a ""buyer beware"" kind of situation, but I also feel like when buying a game in early access, the customer should have some sort of assurance that the game will eventually be finished, unlike the incomplete state this was left in.

												Bought this game 2 years ago. Waited for 2 years for a good update. It never came. As of 4/18/2015 I just noticed it's now full release with virtually no real updates prior, with a full fledged ""Alpha"" feel still to the game as a whole. Many things simply don't work. The inventory system, and shipyard is hard to decipher and hard to understand if you aren't delving through piles of old documents about how they work, most of which is out of date to begin with. This wouldn't bother me too much if the game had any depth or solidity to it. Which it doesn't. It feels like a skeleton of a game. The bare bones of where a great game would start from into becoming a great game, not where a game ends from as a full release.			"

												Very dissaponted that development of this game was abandoned in alpha. I understand that this sometimes happens to Early Access titles, so I'm not angry about that.However, how are they allowed to take it out of Early Access and say it is a complete game? And why are Steam not displaying the real state of the game on the store page? At least when a game is in Early Access, it is made abundantly clear that it is incomplete, buggy and not necessarily going to be finished. By letting Badland Studio release it as if complete they are complicit in the deception. This applies to almost all EA abandonware on Steam...			"

												This is a truly horrible game. I bought into this early access version a couple of years ago because I believed the developers were committed to delivering a high quality space-sim experience. I found the ship building workshop a cool introduction to the game too. All was looking promising and I cooled my interest while the developers worked away.Well two years on (three for the kickstarter backers) and Badland Studio have churned out an ugly, half-baked, poorly optimised, insubstantial product with almost nothing to recommend it.To those who have yet to put money in the pockets of Badland Studio, seriously don't bother.To those who have already paid for/backed the game, you have my condolences. If Steam routinely processed refunds, I would be asking for my money back right about now.			"

												You want an exemple of early access done well ? Don't go here. I bought this game very early in its early access stage (alpha I think, don't know I only played 5 hours in two years). At first I thought that the game was boring because it was an alpha, I was ready to let the time pass and try later when the game would be more polished and interesting. I gave it a try every few month, with every time the hope that it would be a nice game, every time I was not happy. The game pretend to be a mix of Eve, KSP and so on. Procedurally generated universe YEAH, ship costumization YEAH, an adventure of your own YEAH None of that is good. First : ship building is not good. Far from it : the pieces are ugly, the interface is a nightmare, and it's overly complicated for a thing that offer very fews possibilites. Procedurally generated universe and adventures : the faction exists, the planets too, the mission too. But nowhere the game tells you how to accept a mission, how to dock on a space station, what the next thing you could do. I've got nothing about being free on a vast world (not even that vast the world) but what would be nice is some advices about how to get started. In fact the game throw you in it's universe, with a obnoxious and boring text tutorial and expect you to do stuff. Never it tells you what stuff you can do, never it explain youi how to accept missions. All you can do is touch every button with the hope you would find a useful thing (last playtrough I opened fire on a station because I wanted to dock, every patrol in the system warped to me an blew me to pieces) The game takethe worst of every of its inspiration and sublimate them. Well if you want a good space exploration game wait for Elite or Star Citizen, you can't make your own ship but at least it's interesting.			"

												Kinetic Void is another one of Kickstarter's darling children... that got kidnapped and found in a ditch 8 miles from its home. I have followed this game since its alpha, and it's been nothing but a bumpy ride. The devs initially promised a galaxy teeming with things to do, but it was rushed into release and now feels as empty as your relative-who-refuses-to-throw-anything-away's trashcan. The ship builder is great, until you realize that you lack the creative freedom that you yearn for. That's not to say there arent many parts, because there are a TON of parts, which could be a good or bad thing depending on how you personally feel. The combat, although recently updated, feels just lazy and not as inspired as the original concept, and the trade and relations systems are just boring to slog through and dont have much reward in the end. I spent most of my time as a pirate, as it gave me more things to do with enemies constantly on my tail, and that's another thing; the enemies are unrelenting. They refuse to give up, even if they are on the brink of death and you havent taken a scratch. In the end, Kinetic Void is not worth your time at all. Not even on sale.			"

Early Access Review
								Kinetic Void - I originally bought KV for the ship building as I just enjoy playing Lego star ship building. Alas at the time I bought KV actually flying the ship was not that good, But!!........ (EDIT 5th August 2014 : Dev Build 14 ship control is quite good, totally enjoying flying  my crazy designs)Things have changed for the better as patches came along. Now its fun to get your creation made and out into the galaxy, Combat has come a long way since release, and I myself find it fun whilst I fly my ship and bombard the unsuspecting with my weapons. Oh and Combat drones actually do their job, nothing like seeing a wing of my drones attacking the enemies along with my ships weapon systems.Building your ship, at times looks tedious. But its actually quite fun and simple once you understand its mechanics. There is a snap to grid type of mode and freehand mode for fine tuning a module of your ship for that certain look. I can literally spend all my time building a ship save it and begin another as I find it a ton of fun - It is my personal starship lego in my pc - Just a big kid at heart I think.Mining has also came quite a long way, drone now mine the asteroids etc, harvesting ores for selling (A lot more to come I am sure on mining, buts its off to a good start)Updates/patches come fast (I have noticed most Mondays there is an update) which shows the team dedication to KV. Some of the latest updates included some nice new backgrounds for the galaxies (Which I found to be excellent)Dev support is quite good, I think this is one place where any game company (AAA or Indie) can excel or die from. Thankfully KV's team is quite good at letting the game players upto date on things coming and patch information. I myself have posted a comment or two and have had the Dev Team reply auite quickly on the topics  (This is something I look for in an Indie Team/Alpha release games - A+ guys/gals)KV is still very alpha and most of us by now know what ""alpha"" means and if your unsure maybe wait a little longer, but I have not been disappointed with my purchase. KV has a long way to go with what is planned, but I think its going to be a fun ride as KV progresses into a full release.I own pretty much every space game from Elite on C64 to the latest flop by a AAA developer, and all I can say is:KV is another space game that I am happy to of added to my list of games I play each time I log into Steam.If space games are your genre, I recommend adding this Indie title to you collection, for the price you will get your moneys worth out of it indeed!!!!

												I greenlighted this game and downloaded it immediately after being realeased as early alpha on steam.I had fun at the beginig building ships, but after that ?It was already hard to find anything to do in outerspace and control were hard to understand. I tried locking target, nothing, firing, nothing, clearing target, nothing...But I continued to play. In the end, I stopped when the credit system was introduced since I couldn't build capital ship anymore.I come back 1 year later for the ""finished"" product and... Nothing changed at all.Yes, there are ""missions"", the first I had was going through checkpoints and fighting smuglers that had the exact same ship I just builded. And since the fighting system is the same, I couldn't figure how to defend myself. My canon was aligned, it fired in the void and 2 seconds later I was dead. So worth the 30 minutesI spent going through 2 checkpoint.The ""map"". Is that really a finished map ? Seriously ? Evevn I couldn't read the alpha version maps, they were batter than that.Impossibility to navigate or see what is in the sectors or system (Yeah, still can't tell the difference, for me a star= system, a sector = systems. And all object are blank basic 3d model they are not textured.I think I remeber it was possible to put waypoint in early access to know where we wanted to go. Not anymore, I just wandered never knowing what to do.There are a lot graphic glitches are hugly effects. First planet I encoutered, The atmospher disappeared sometime and there was a white line separating the two emispheres.Another thing, it is said that the game is in it public realease because all fetures goal were reached, so where is the cockpit view ?And where is the difference with the gme from 1 year ago ?

												Fantastic concept, will never be worth $20 dollars in it's current state. The game has a unique ship building system which is sort of unique. Otherwise, it's nothing special.There appear to be quite... 'variety' of things to do, and events that unfold througout the.. 'galaxy,' like wars, and what appears to be something similar to a stock market of sorts. Otherwise, that's it.I tried to see what this war thing was all about, only to find nothing different (in the few hours that I had spared after slowly traveling to it), heck even the spawnrate for hostile ships seemed the same. You can mine asteroids, salvage destroyed enemy ships, and fight enemy ships, follwed up by crashing into very badly textured planets, which you can't really do anything at, as of yet (I would think it might work as some sort of psuedo space station-asteroid that you could both mine and trade at, or whatever).The developers developed the system to be overly complex, only to supply extremely minimal explenations. Experimenting is almost a must, just to get a complete handle of how to do stuff. At some points, I even found myself pressing every single key on my keyboard, just to see which button did what, as there were no other ways to finding out, until maybe recently. The space flight itself is incredibly boring, and you may as well be running around in your room, holding a car in your hand, squeeling ""Vroom!"" like a child- although only moving your ship at a snails pace. In otherwords, the ships handle with an unnecessarily complex system (which about half is redundant/useless), and fly like toys. The combat is not much better, depending on how you do it. Most of the time, you will be just sitting there, either blasting your lasers/rockets/whatever at the enemy, whittling down their shields, and then their hull. Then they go boom. Then you move on. Sometimes, the ships even crash into your own, absolutely obliterating you.The best way to earn money is to just grind the asteroids away, and sell the ores you get at the stations. (which are now incredibly ♥♥♥♥ing hard to find, since they made only one every 2 lightyears spawn compared to the usual 10 or so in small groups you used to be able to find).The only problem with selling is that you need to first take your ship's inventory, move everything into the station's inventory, and then go to the shop, click on your inventory, then click on the checkbox for your cargo, then the ore/water you collected, then finally.. sell them for a measily price of what might as well be 2 cents. This might be easier if it were in a better GUI, and the redundant stuff being removed. (EG shops being able to buy your stuff directly from ship inventory). The exploration aspect is ok, but bassically once you'd seen a single system, you'd seen them all.the different faction ships are not really much different from the other faction's, even though the factions are random gen, which I understand- making randomly generated ships as well would probably be a bit too much for these devs. Regardless, there's no point in exploring, beyond trade (which combined with the slow-paced travel system = you tearing hair out).Rating? EDIT:1/10, minimal to no work has been done. Very little has been added, fixed or changed. Presumably, the project has been abandonded.Dont buy it, it will just be another game to taunt you with regret in your steam library.			"

I can't believe Steam would have this game for sale Knowing its dead. Steam you have a responsibility to your members to help keep them from being ripped off. I guess profit is more important.			"

Early Access Review
								First off i would like to say that this is almost a cut and paste from another review I have done.  If your reading this review, you already know if the game will be anything close to what your looking to play.  I am here to review the Devs of the game.  So many teams out there pump whatever dribble they please out without consideration of those playing the game.  Ive owned the game for a long time and when I got the game it was very incomplete.  As of todays patch I will be loading it up again to see the progress.  The newest patch made me reread some of the discussions and reviews, just to see the team be concerned over positive and negative reviews as they are, and the way they phrase the responses has led me to admire and respect them.  And I know my experience and concerns about the product will be addressed with the same level of care.  Dont take that for granted people, if your just looking into the game be assured your opinion counts and just buy it already, support good devs and help shape the things to come.			"

Early Access Review
								Kinetic Void is getting there. It's a good game, but it's in development. So things are missing. Some things are broken. But there is an awfully fun space game in here. It place nicely, the ship builder is great and it feels great to fly around in. Give it a crack.			"

Posted: March 29, 2015
												This is the very first Steam product that made me write a review. And a very negative one. The reason is that, apparently, if you don't write a review for Kinetic Void on Steam, your opinion about this game doesn't count. The developer Sean Pollman a.k.a. LumberingTroll (now that I think about the names connected to KV – LumberingTROLL, Kinetic VOID, BADland Studio – in the retrospect, I think those should have been blatant warning signs in themselves, maybe the stupider of us just didn't get the message :-D) said that ""KV has sold 120,000 copies and only 351 people gave it a thumbs down [which is the number of negative Steam reviews to the date of posting his statement]"". Yes, unbelievable as it may seem, this is actually the mindset of the developer. But that's only the very start.Kinetic Void is a ""game"" (I am very reluctant to call KV in its current state a game, but I'll get to that in time) that had spent three years in development. Unfortunately, the state in which the ""game"" happens to be now doesn't reflect it a least bit. From very basic, spartan, ugly and sometimes non-functional UI, to a very poor amount of content in the game (there's really just nothing to do beyond the ship builder). The optimization also is a joke, graphics are so last-century, yet you need a decent rig to run it fluently (X3: Albion Prelude, despite being older game, looks much better and runs far smoother, especially on my former GPU NVidia 9600 GT, on which X3:AP ran smooth as silk, whereas KV lagged like hell all the time; but to be fair, I have to admit that on Radeon HD 7850 I have no problem with either game, so it's especially older computers that will have a problem with running KV). The ""game"" is simply far from being finished. Everywhere you look, every aspect of the ""game"" that you examine, everything just feels unpolished or downright unfinished. Also, the only part of the ""game"" which you can actually enjoy is the ship builder which is the most finished feature of the game (by the standards of KV, because it's still lacking in many ways). The rest is just flying in empty space (you can also enter the atmosphere of any planet, only to be presented with a close-up sight of bland atrocious-resolution textures), shooting at enemy ships and mining (consisting of concentrating your mining beam on an asteroid for dulling amount of time). And that's about it. Already dissuaded from buying Kinetic Void? Just wait please, we still haven't even left the starting line...Three years of development after which Kinetic Void left Early Access program and was labeled a ""finished"" product (despite still being in the same unfinished state as it'd been always before). That was in November 2014. Now it's almost April 2015 and no progress whatsoever has been made to make the ""game"" actually working or to expand its direly lacking features. Only a few patches with no actual improvements, save for some bugfixes, came out since that time. Just take a look at the patch announcement history. ""But wait, the developers just have a lot on their plate right now and maybe they get to it later and right the respective wrongs,"" you may say. Now, bear in mind that Sean Pollman said himself on the forums that his team has dissolved, and that they're now down to only two people ""working"" on the ""game"" (you have to take this in with a very open mind, since that ""work"" is nowhere to be seen on the ""game"") and that they've also opened a brick & mortar board-game store, plus they've started working on ""another small project"" to cover their costs. Yes, two people are working on Kinetic Void, manning their store and then even working on another ""small project"", all at the same time. Go figure how long will it take to shape Kinetic Void into anything resembling a ""working state"" (also bear in mind that to get in its current sorry and unfinished state, it took three years for KV, and that's with more people working on it full-time). I'd wager that it'll take forever and then some, but I'm open to bets.Based on all the mentioned, it's no wonder that negative reviews started rolling in after the ""game"" was made ""final"" in November last year. I had bought Kinetic Void literally week earlier and expected it to stay in the Early Access for some time, since I knew that I was buying an unfinished product at the time (with a very naive hope that I would get an actual finished game someday – I thereby openly admit, that I was very stupid to buy it :-)). When the ""release"" came week later, I was quite (negatively) surprised by that but I decided to wait a few months to see how the things would unveil. We already know how it all actually went, so it's no wonder that I started getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off, along with many other former fans of the ""game"". So, after a developer posted his excuses on the forum, I endeavoured to reply (very honestly, but hopefully not rudely – I'll let you be the judges[imgur.com]). But boy, have I dared too much by that! Some other people came with their opinions after me, the developer came with his disrespectful retort (check out the review by Mandrake, he's among the ones who had been discussing in this thread) and not a very long time after, the whole thread suddenly disappeared. I don't know if it was deleted by Pollman or Valve (some folks wrote that they reported the thread on the grounds of the developer's disrespectful reactions), but it was. So yeah, I hope you get the picture of how you're treated when you express your dissatisfaction with Kinetic Void or the manners of its developer.To sum it all up: if you want to support one individual by the name Sean Pollman who in three years isn't capable enough to develop even so much as a basic game that just works (despite his promises), doesn't respect his paying customers, takes their money to open his board-game store and then calls them (unpleasant) names for expressing their opinions, then by all means, go ahead and buy this ""game"". If you actually value your hard-earned money, then I recommend to stay away from this inept developer and his atrocious product as far as you only can. Get yourself X3: Terran Conflict + Albion Prelude instead, which comes for the exact same price, yet it is a far, far, FAR better product in EVERY regard. "

Everything about the UI is clunky and nonsensical, and there's very little in the way of gameplay, if it can be called that.

												Highly incomplete game, the controls don't make sense. It crashes, and it has no real tutorial. It has info popups, but alot of them aren't helpful and the ones that might be are hard to understand without a firm grasp on another mechanic that wasn't explained.There seems to be no real missions or campaign, there's nothing to really do as far as I can tell. It has screenshots of cool things on the steam page, but I just can't manage to get out of making my first ship and not dying to the randomly generated bandits that kill me before the environment fully loads.This game is broken, buggy, and content incomplete. They said it was released because they couldn't be arsed to finish it. A true exploitation of early access, considering they haven't really done much since it was first realeased on steam.Also, for those talking about ths ship builder being the best part of the game... Space Engineers has far better ship building that is easier to understand, and Space Engineers has a little something to do with the ships. This game has nothing to do once you make a ship.			"

												First thing's first. I enjoy Kinetic Void a lot. I've had this game for over a year now, and in that time I've seen it progress remarkably far, with most of the work going into the Shipyard (by far this game's most impressive feature) and the general usability. The game is in a very playable state, but make sure you read at least some of the tutorials and give it some time to get used to the way the editor works - it's a great tool if you give it time.The shipyard, where you build your vessels, is almost at completion (I think they mentioned more parts were to be added), but mechanically it's there and it's very robust. There's a working galactic economy, and factions will vie for control of star systems.Yes, the game's got lots of features to come - some more ambitious ones rely on good sales -  but then what other game allows you to choose almost any given space ship from any game/movie/series that someone has built and fly it around in a sandbox galaxy. You can also change the game files so that, say, one faction uses all Star Destroyers, while another has ships from the Halo universe, Mass Effect or whatever you like. And this is without mentioning the hundreds of stellar, original, designs created by players and uploaded to the workshop (early workshop integration was an excellent decision by the devs). Most 'Space' games will give you the choice of a handful of ships to pilot and own, whereas KV's 'build your own' approach means that aside from as many as YOU can build, you can tap into the creative output of hundreds of other players, many of whom have written backstory/lore for their ships in their workshop descriptions. These can be used to populate your universe.The Devs are very open about how the game is progressing and I think that they are helped by a strong community. You get responses to any feedback or bug reports you leave very quickly and the direction in which the game is headed is very clearly layed out.I spend about 90% of my time on this game in the shipyard, so I should make it clear that unless you plan to immerse yourself in the ship creation aspect, you probably won't get the most out of Kinetic Void, but if, like me, you get sucked up into the whole creative process of building a ship from scratch, you can't go wrong. A big thumbs up from me! :)			"

												Having bought this in early access a while back, I saw a great potential in Kinetic Void that I hoped would someday be realised. Sadly, with it reaching its milestone v1.0 just a few days ago, I cannot in good faith recommend this game, for reasons I'll outline below.First and foremost, this game still feels very, very unfinished. Going purely on the surface aesthetics, the visuals (which I remain a fan of) may be reasonable, but the interface remains a chore to interact with and there's something distinctly offputting about the cumbersome text windows used to introduce you to the game's mechanics. Overall, it's adequate. But that's all.In terms of gameplay, Kinetic Void has changed in a few subtle but relatively significant steps since the early access builds of a month or two ago. The economy system seems to be in full drive, and the updates you receive regarding loss of cargo et cetera definitely maintain the connection between you and the big wide galaxy. In terms of the ship-to-ship combat, however, I find that even in its supposedly finished state the controls are unintuitive, with a host of keyboard bindings to memorise which, while I could get to grips with, might not be everyone's cup of tea. There's also nothing particularly inspiring about the combat- you lock on to a ship, then let your guns auto-fire on them until either you or they explode. You can try and manually fire your guns with the handy target-leading reticule now implemented, but it's still painfully monotonous and generally a wasted effort. That, and with the drastic reduction in flight speed that was implemented a while back, the game still plays very slowly and dogfights, which used to be relatively intense, are now relatively lacklustre.Regarding other aspects of the game: the music remains the same as it's been since I first bought it, and is for the most part adequate. It's occasionally repetetive, and the game possesses no facility for contextual change, so combat will sound basically identical to drifting aimlessly through space. Of storyline there is essentially no sign, but then this was never supposed to be a story-driven game, so there's no discredit meant by that. What could have been a well thought out and richly populated universe, however, has been sacrificed for the sake of customisation.This is indeed my problem with this game. Yes, you read that right. My main problem with Kinetic Void is the degree of customisation. Normally, I love games that include vast and excessively complex levels of customisation. What Kinetic Void offers, however, is a deceptively shallow amount of purely aesthetic customisation. Sure, you can build whatever shape ship you want and put whatever guns you want on it. But essentially, what do all those guns do? They're essentially reskins of the same gun, with different 'on-paper' stats. There's no distinct feel to it. As a game intended to be played more than once, Kinetic Void has little to involve the player and prompt different playthroughs. That lack of distinction is where I feel the game really falls down, and it's a problem I've seen with several games offering the same degree of customisation as Kinetic Void. The developers have clearly made a conscious effort to give the player a unique experience with plenty of options, and I respect that. But that breadth comes at the expense of depth. The universe of Kinetic Void is as harsh and barren as space itself, populated with empty, identical ships that maintain a visual pretense of being different. It's a very specific issue I have with the game, and I realise that many people might not feel the same way about it, but as someone whose expectations were built up significantly by the early-access hype, I cannot help but feel disappointed with how Kinetic Void has progressed.On a positive note, the developers intend to continue adding features, meaning that there may be a little light at the end of the tunnel for us early-access buyers. For the most part, however, I feel that with significant overhaul now a recently dead prospect, Kinetic Void is and will always be simply an 'adequate' iteration of a dream that could have been great.

												Kinetic Void is a good idea that never made it.  There was so much potential in this game, yet it failed in almost every aspect.  When I purchased it in Early Access, I knew there was the possibility of failure as there always is.  That makes it even more sad that this game is in such a terrible state.Not everything about it is bad.  There is so much good in the ship building, nearly rivalling the Galactic Civilization games in terms of level of customization.  The concepts the devs had in mind for the game showed promise.  It could've been a good Battlecruiser game for once.But that's about where the good aspects of the game ends.  The ship building is far from being complete, with many, if not most, of the ship component mechanics not properly or fully implemented.  The gameplay is largely shallow and unfinished.  Almost everything promised for the players was left out, as if the devs decided to completely abandon the game rather than finish it.Which is effectively what they did.  They decided that a game in its alpha stages was good enough to sell people and stopped updating it.  This game could have been a proper Battlecruiser-style game that was actually good for once.  Instead, it's an abandoned and unfinished mess without any word on why they did so.  This could've genuinely been good, had they finished.			"

Early Access Review
								NOTE: this only covers what the game is in its current state, as more content is added I may (read probably) change to recommending this game.The premisce of this game is gorious, build a beautiful spaceship from parts, stick modules in and fly around in a proceduraly generated universe. However at the moment there isn't enough content in the game to justify the purchase. While there are plenty of parts and they look lovely, adding modules is very tedious, and most of them don't even do anything yet. The combat currently fells quite lacking, fly towards an enemy, lock onto them and push a button to turn on your guns. Now keep your ship so the guns can turn to face them and try to stay in range.Then there are the performance issues. The performance of the game isn't great, about as good as you could expect from an alpha. Both content and performance wise the game is improving, but I personally will require more real gameplay to be added before I am prepared to recoomend this game.			"

												As of this write up I've played about 6 hours of Kinetic Void, according to Steam. The main draw to this is obviously going to be ship building and customisation. There seems to be a fair number of parts to mix and match between and the editor, once you get used to it, is fairly intuitive. There are some bugs with the mirroring tool that desperately need to be worked out – at times the game will not recognise that the mirrored part is positioned in a perfectly valid location, despite registering the original component as being fine to put down. You can pretty much attach whatever you want to whatever you want. Go nuts – it’s not going to stop you. The basic shapes are generally quite blocky, but there’s enough manipulation to go around that you can, with a little innovation, make some interesting ships and they won’t look like a spruced up Minecraft creation. Combat, despite being a central focus of this game, isn’t particularly mind-blowing. It’s mid-way between EVE and X3. You won’t get straight up X3 style twitch-based dog-fighting, but you won’t be forced to watch your ship auto-pilot in circles which you hit hotkeys 1-9 to fire your missiles. It's a bit clunky but it works and there's some room for skill involved, alongside some tactical considerations to think about. There's an economy. Who knows how it works, but it does. And you start to realise how essential non-combatants are in a universe. Games like X3, Vegastrike, etc - you see so many random little shuttles and traders and civilian craft trundling around the universe from station to station. For the most part they aren't actually doing anything, but it's nice to have them there – they add a bit of flesh to the skeleton. In Kinetic void, you don't have that. There are only military grade ships. This is tied into, and probably because of, the way the game determines what class a ship is - procedurally based on various factors. But it also means that everything is flatly centred on combat. Feasibly you could populate the universe with your own cargo tugs and passenger shuttles and so on and so forth: but everything seems to be classed as a combat vessel, and so you don't want to run up against a fleet of unarmed cargo tugs that the AI has pulled out of the background because it thinks they're fighters. You can mine in this game and you can trade, but you are the only person mining in the entire universe, and you are the only actual trader in the universe. That makes it feel very lifeless, despite the fact that there are usually a fair number of ships flying around. The economy runs in the background, and events occur and things change it, but none of it happens in front of you. It doesn't appear to be as fleshed out as it should be. As far as I can tell there are two stations in the entire game: the ship station and the mining station. The mining station appears to be for visual effect only. You can't dock at it and it doesn't do anything. So you mine an steroid for about 5 different resources, trade them for credits at the all-in-one station, and upgrade your ship. There really doesn't appear to be an on-the-surface economy and that’s really disappointing because it’s only logical to conclude that you can’t actually affect the economy through the economy. If you can, you are the only one capable of doing it, when you should be just one more ship in the universe. Where are the other mining vessels drilling into asteroids? Where are the other scavengers going after scrapped vessels? Where are the merchants trying to make a profit from the uncertain wartime market? What are these resources going towards? Why do they exist? What do they build? Who knows. The universe needs more persistence. Enemies will show up in your sector, usually accompanied by mission markers, and you can run or fight. They'd be more of a threat if they could affect things if they could harass trade lanes, kill merchants, and affect the economy underlying the various wars that sprout up. Or if they just stayed in system after you've docked. Because they instantly de-spawn the minute you dock so the system gets reset to 0, which means that anything that looked like it could be interesting, could potentially produce emergent scenarios, etc.... well that's gone. This really needs to be fixed, because it undermines everything that a space sim should be about. You don’t feel like you’re immersed in the game – just skimming the surface of the under-lying calculations. Wars happen, sectors are taken, but there’s no apparent war. Someone desperately called me to this frontline battle. I expected to be way in over my head, but I thought it would be worth the view, so I jumped into the conflict. Nothing. Concerned that I had got the wrong system, I checked the map. Yep - active war zone designation. I was in a war zone without a shot being fired. The faction holding the zone lost, and were eradicated, but nobody saw them fighting an enemy. Planetary flight is fun to have. Not much more to say. Kinetic Void just doesn't feel like it has the depth that you expect from a space sim. It doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a universe simulation or a combat simulation, and ends up in this strange space between. I honestly wouldn't say it's at 1.0 status. It feels like space sim lite. The ship building is good fun, the fact that your own ships start to populate the universe around you is brilliant. But the universe itself just doesn't feel very alive and that undermines the whole experience. The game will run on a potato: with everything turned down to very low it runs on a mid-2010 Macbook pro with 320M chipset at a decent clip and doesn't stutter much.			"

												I bought this a long time ago on early access, I think almost a year ago? since then it's really come a long way, and while there are indeed still some things that need balancing or that can/will be expanded upon it is already a very enjoyable game. Reading the other reviews I wonder if I'm even writing this for the right game *checks* ahem. yes. same game. strange.The shipbuilder is fantastic, there are very few games which allow you to build the ship you want to this degree, and while it's true there isn't much in the way of story or goals, it is very much a space exploration/flying game. combat is somewhat simplistic, made a bit more complex by the weapon arcs and that you design the ship yourself. so if you want something that's very much head-on? design it that way! prefer to blast foes apart with broadsides? go for it! etc. etc.It runs good on my pc, but I am at the high end, and have no knowledge on how it'd run on lower capacity rigs.EDIT:some further information to anyone looking at the release of kinetic void and thinking of DF9's... issues. yesterday I reported 3-4 issues on their threads, and within 6 hours two of them were resolved for the next patch, and now, 25 hours after reporting it, all the issues have been resolved for the next patch. So at the very least for now, this is not a double-fine 'Lets release the game and stop working on it' case. How it'll develop I cannot say, But the developers are clearly actively and responsively working on fixing the few issues it still has. in short, they have in no way released and abandoned this title.

												I got the game a while back while it was still in alpha because I liked the concept of the game: build your ship and explore the universe. However, it was rather raw then (and understandably so at such an early stage), so I put it aside with hopes it would mature into a great game. I wish I could say that that is what happened, but when I played the 1.0 release of it, my hopes quickly vanished. They've improved the UI somewhat since the game was in alpha, but the game and the UI are still somewhat glitchy and feel clunky.The biggest failing that I see in it though lies in what I (personally at least) expect in a sandbox type game. To work a sandbox has to provide an immersive universe in some way such as the building mechanics in space engineers or enough universe lore and detail that the player can feel like a part of everything around him or her. Without this, what would be a glorious sandbox becomes a sloppy game with no objectives. Unfortunately, I see kinetic void as a sloppy game with no objectives right now.I'm sorry to give such a negative review. I hope some people find enough good in the game to still enjoy it, but for me it was a waste of money.			"

Early Access Review
								alright im redoing this review because there was an update recently that fixed some of the issues with the game. the game performs much better now and the interface has also improved.it is much easier to install parts into your creations and build ships. though certain things are seperated out so if you want to install armor onto ALL your turrets you have to select them all individually same with your engines once you get into open space my framrate doesnt tank as badly as it once did. now it only tanks when im being swarmed by enemies and my turrets attempt to lock onto them. also framerate tanks whenever i open the map screen which is weird.the building is first rate but the combat is based upon a turret system so if you want to actually control the weapons you have to press an auxilary button to fire them yourself. otherwise all the weapons feel really♥♥♥♥♥♥weak with no noticible difference between the large and small weapons in terms of damage though the smaller ones usually fire faster. the automated targeting with the weapons is rather slow and you can find your systems overloaded if you mark to many targets at once. even then i have had times when i have marked just one target and though its still within range they wont actually fire at the enemies.can i recommend it now. on gameplay no. the menus have gotten better so i can recommend the game on that.

It has promise, but it just isn't delivering on the promise.It has a tutorial of similar scope and depth to the original Kerbal Space Program tutorial on rocketry, but nothing at all for what you're supposed to do after you leave the space station!Missions pop up in the dialog box but they don't tell you where to go or who to fight, just ""We need help over here""Trying to figure out how to get from one side of a system to another is almost impossible and relies largely on blind luck to figure it out, and once you do figure that out and who exactly is calling for your help, good luck ever getting to them in a timely manner to help out.Do not buy this game.

												I was really excited about the game when Purchased it the game was still in early release and had its flaws, but as time went on the flaws were never fixed. The ship builder is pretty cool but its hard to figure out how everything works (not everything does). Then when you actualy build a ship that works there really isnt a point other than flying around. The game offers no direction which isnt a bad thing (space engineers) but the sandbox feel is lost after building your ship. Trading is difficult to understand and resource gathering is bugged. As of now 3/15 the game lacks a sense of purpose for the player. Why should I mine? Why should I gather salvage? Why should I fight these pirates (other than its the part of the game that works the best).If your looking for a game with no real goal and no reason to play any farther than building a ship and shooting something this game is for you. BUT if you want a game that actualy has play value and will keep you envolved for more than 4 hours look elsewear. THIS IS NOT A SANDBOX GAME. ITS NOT EVEN A SPACE ADVENTURE GAME. THE ONLY TAG THEY GOT RIGHT IS SIMULATION AND THAT ISNT EVEN 100% CORRECT			"

												UPDATE!Since the last time I looked at this game proper much hasn't changed, however I will say this. It's still complicated as ♥♥♥♥, still very boring after you build your ship, and still without much meat. However, it's still alive and the devloper (Maybe there's another? I dunno...) is still working on this machination of code, modeling, and texturing.My previous post was just a stupid bandwagon thing from long-ish time ago. Now that I've tried it again I can still say this...IF!AND ONLY IF!You can handle the game as it is right now or think you can try it and then return it in the window of time that Steam has to return an item. Do it, try it out and see what you think, if you like it and think you can be patient for it to grow. Then buy it,m but if it's not solmething you think you can invest in... Don't, simply watch and wait till you see when it's worth the investment.My offer to gift this game still stands, but is currently looking to go to user Lunchbox.If someone decides to claim it after him, then they can have it if he doesn't responde.OLD ""REVIEW"" BELOW! _________________________________________________________Honestly, when it first came out, I was hoping for the best. However, that failed and I was left with a game that I paid $20 for, that I could replicate the results with a few days in Blender with more to show for it.Avoid this game, don't purchase it, if someone wants to try it I'll happily gift it to you. Share the knowledge of the game and it's atrocities.			"

												What a letdown. This game has one of the most in-depth ship creators I've ever seen, and that part of the game is really cool. Then it got abandoned before the rest could be implemented or polished. Once you make the ship you can fly it around, but my interest was quickly lost. The combat and the universe and the ideas/mechanics are just lackluster, either broken or barely formed. The ideas seemed great, but ultimately you'll want to avoid getting this. There are other games that are similar that actually DID get completed. I wish that it would get finished, but it seems utterly forgotten.			"

												I was really excited about the game when Purchased it the game was still in early release and had its flaws, but as time went on the flaws were never fixed. The ship builder is pretty cool but its hard to figure out how everything works (not everything does). Then when you actualy build a ship that works there really isnt a point other than flying around. The game offers no direction which isnt a bad thing (space engineers) but the sandbox feel is lost after building your ship. Trading is difficult to understand and resource gathering is bugged. As of now 3/15 the game lacks a sense of purpose for the player. Why should I mine? Why should I gather salvage? Why should I fight these pirates (other than its the part of the game that works the best).If your looking for a game with no real goal and no reason to play any farther than building a ship and shooting something this game is for you. BUT if you want a game that actualy has play value and will keep you envolved for more than 4 hours look elsewear. THIS IS NOT A SANDBOX GAME. ITS NOT EVEN A SPACE ADVENTURE GAME. THE ONLY TAG THEY GOT RIGHT IS SIMULATION AND THAT ISNT EVEN 100% CORRECT			"

												Kinetic void is plainly one of those games that you should avoid. The graphics are sub-standard. They come out to be cartoony. Also the game is terribly optimized. When i got this 1 year ago, i could run it fine. With all the changes they made to the engine, I can't even run it at the lowest settings. These issues are just the smallest tip of this mountain of crap. First there are no mechanics in this game. Build a ship, get blown up, blow up other ships. There is no universe, there are no missions. There is no story. There is absolutely nothing to do, but build ships. However, the ship maker has gotten more and more complex to the point that a new palyer will rather just give up than play for 3 hours to find the correct modules to put on their ship. After those 3 hours, you can just wander around. The devs really disappointed me by releasing this hald-baked product. It is half-baked, all those nice promises on their EA page, lies....just lies. Even worse some of thsoe promises are being turned into DLC. Really? Really? Are EA and Ubisoft your inspirations? DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!			"

												Don't let the store page fool you: this is an early access game that the devolopers simply set to 1.0 when they ran out of money, which was long, long before the game was finished, and certainly before it was ready for prime time. You might enjoy the shipbuilding in this game! Certainly some have, and it's got a unique slant to it. But once you leave the dock, there's nothing to do, and lots of vast, empty space to wander around in before that becomes clear. Steam isn't hurting for sandbox games.

												The only good part to this game is the ship builder and the graphics.Been waiting for two years now, and still there is barely any actual gameplay to this mess. It is clear that the devs have just given up on it.Buy X3/Elite if you want to explore space. If you want a meaningful ship builder that's just as pretty, buy Galactic Civilisations III.There is nothing to recommend here.

Early Access Review
								Note that this review is written and submitted for a currently unfinished game(as of September 10th 2014), and that anything therein is subject to change.Kinetic Void is a pretty decent looking space simulator with a lot of potential and a small but dedicated development team. I figure that the easiest way to review the game is to just list off a few of the more notable pros an cons as they are at the time of writing this review.PROS:-The game has a fairly robust ship creator/editor that allows you to make some really interesting and complex stuff if you sit down and practice a bit-The player has a good amount of control over various aspects of both their ship and their way of spacefaring. Controls are fluid, weapons are responsive, and the game supports both keyboard and mouse control of the player's ship.-It was interesting to learn that ship designs you save can potentially be used by NPCs, including enemies.-The development team takes their time with updates, but is extremely consistent and dedicated in their work. New content might take a while, but I've never felt that the game has been abandoned by the devs like so many other early access titles.CONS:-Being early-access, there are still a number of bugs and other assorted issues to be ironed out. You're accepting that fact by purchasing the game in an incomplete state-Space is almost realistically a bit too empty a lot of the time. I'd really like to see the number and variety of structures in each system increased-Currently the variety of parts in the game is fairly large, but all parts are locked to one of five size classes, meaning that it can sometimes be difficult to make attractive ships, mainly smaller craft like fighters and interceptors.-The game has little in the way of missions or goals. You're dropped in and expected to find your way around the vast expanse of space on your own. This will most likely be fixed later, but hey, that's life, you know?Overall, I'd recommed this game to a friend if I knew that they were interested in a space sim that will eventually be very in-depth and detailed. Right now the game is still very lacking in features, but I have faith in the dev team to complete Kinetic Void, and the amount of content and bug fixes increases with every update.			"

												Man oh man did I really want to enjoy this game, but I just couldn't.Let me start off by saying that the ship creator is absolutely amazing. There are hundreds of parts and weapons that basically ensure each ship you make is never exactly the same as the last. There are literally trillions of design options you can make with this. You can make a tiny fighter, or a giant space city, and everything in between. I have literally spent hours exploring many different unique designs in this game, and it was simply a fun experience.But what about when you finish making your ship? What do you do then?Well, thats where the fun ends.After you make your ship you have the option go out into the vast vacuum of space and explore. Except, theres not much to explore.  All you can do in this game is fight with other ships, or warp to random areas with planets.  The planets have enterable atmospheres, but the surfaces have absolutely nothing. Basically all you do is engage in random combat with any ship you see. You can't trade. You can't make the life that you want to like the devs promised. All you can do is fight. But you'd think that when fighting is the only mechanic in the game, it would be extremely good, right?You would think wrong.The combat system is outright horrible. You have the option to manually fire your weapons, or have them fire automatically based on groups you assign them.  Its a good system when you look at it on paper, except that all weapons have a range of less than 2 feet. They cannot hit anything at range AT ALL. Not only that, but certain weapons won't fire when you tell them to, if they fire at all, especially in the group system. Even when you're facing the direction those weapons are supposed to be pointing to, they still will not fire. There are way too many near game breaking bugs that plague this game. It likes to crash. A lot. Many times have I lost my shipbuilding progress to a crash. There are many graphic related bugs like the planet textures not loading properly, and your ship sometimes appearing completely white.Overall, I cannot recommend this game at all. There is little content and way too many bugs. It's not even worthy of being an early access game, let alone a full release. I tried so hard to love this game, I really did. But in the end it was simply a bucket full of disappointment.			"

Now whines about how this is his only income instead of actually doing something constructive.Bad 'game'.VERY bad dev.EDIT: PS don't let my play time fool you as unfortunately I was a KS backer of this steaming pile, and only checked back from time-to-time after it was on steam to see if they actually added anything beyond a shipbuilder, and well, not!

												2016 Update: Game is in stasis as the lead dev is now alone on the team and is looking for help to continue the project.TLDR; game has one awesome ship builder and ship workshop collection that lets you pit your builds against other player made ships you add to the game (PvE, not PvP), but not much else in the way of features. It has given me over two hundred hours of playtime, which when compared to my playtime on bigger titles, makes me feel that it was still worth my money despite my disappointment that further development did not continue.---Warning #1: If building ships and then flying them is not your thing and you're looking for a more linear/on-rails type of game, then this is probably not your thing.Warning #2: This is not a space dogfighting simulator or a replacement for Star Citizen.Warning #3: This will let you build a great many types of ships and then fight in them. Don't expect much else. Due to the lack of other games that let you do this as extensively as KV does, I will still recommend this game despite many of the flaws. Edit: I have Starmade and my playtime on it versus this game should tell you what I prefer.Warning #4: Get player made ships off the Workshop. Seriously. It is not modding per se but more an intended aspect of the game. Pit your designs against that of other players and all in all make the galaxy a much more varied and interesting place. :D---Disclaimer: I see a lot of bitterness from people who were following the game for a long time, so I should say that though I was following it, my own purchase was recent and I am free of any negative bias or expectation in that context. I was never a backer. My review should help new people looking for a different sort of space game experience.---The 'Build' here means the ability to build your own ships. As far as I know (so far) you can only build your own ship, not structures or anything else.The 'Battle' is you against everything else. I have seen no sign of being able to have NPC allied ships under your control in a 'fleet' (so far).The 'Explore' depends on how big you make the starting universe. However, it's only space travel. I don't believe there is any planet landing involved. Edit: However, you can enter the atmosphere of the planet and fly over the surface. Devs plan on bringing in working cities and such on the surface and possible even space to ground/ground to space exchange of fire. :-D---Early hours impressions: having a blast making ships! :DYet to actually leave the shipyard. WIll update as I play more~!===Update #1 (12/7/2014): I have left the shipyard and blown up my first space pirates. Hmmm, I think my ship's too strong.Essential impression: This game is basically the developers providing you with the tools to start your adventure. How you want it to be will depend on you, it seems. For example, I made my ship too strong so wiped out enemies without feeling like I was in any danger. Unfortunately, it's impossible to assess what I can do to have a fun experience at this point. Work need to be done to give some cues to players to be able to intuitively assess how strong they are compared to enemies, etc.There appears to be a lot more to this game, and I've barely begun to scratch the surface. Still would recommend at this point.Update #1.5 (12/7/2014; later in the day): found strong enemies. Almost died. Fun fun. Seems the preparation a.k.a. building your ship is 95% of the fight. If I hadn't built my shape they way I had (out of pure dumb luck) I would've died. Me gusta...Again, no real way to assess what can happen. You could say this is more realistic. :-PAlso, The missions just scroll and don't seem to be tracked per se. Not sure I'm a fan of this system. Seemed weak.Seriously huge annoyance when you are trying to crawl within range of the station to dock in a big ship... Maybe I'm missing something? The 'Warp to within 10' doesn't always work... I often end up 50+ away when warping to a station.Update 2.0 (2/10/2015): still playing this game. Like I have said before, this game gives you the tools to make your own pew pew experience. Highly recommend getting fellow-player made ships and populating the galaxies you generate. Just subscribing will do. Meeting and then fighting said ships will let you pit your design against that of other people. Getting the workshop ships is, imo, essential to enjoying this game, and isn't 'modding' in any way but intended.---There was an annoying ship builder issue that got fixed real fast, so really glad for the support. :-)[02/21/2015] - more bug fixes and improvements have come in. Some fo my previous annoyances have disappeared.---Not entirely stable on my machine for some reason, but this is the kind of game I am willing to play through a buggy experience and support (like the X games minus X Rebirth).

												Kinetic Void at first seemed to be a fairly promising title, I've been a space nut for a long time and am a huge fan of the older Homeworld series and the slightly more elusive 0-R-B Off-World Resource Base. So I got Kinetic Void when it was on sale for about $5, thinking why not, then the trouble started.The previews for the game show very good graphics with a beautiful star backdrop and detailed rendering of the ships, but with the latest update at over a year old, the skybox does not render meaning there are no stars, planets look like cheese, nebulae fog looks like sprites, etc etc, though the sun has a nice lens flare. Long story short, what you see in the previews is a little misleading.The game itself is still in development but had been on hold for a year now, it has virtually no backstory and not alot to do within the game. You can of course try to make the beefiest ship alive and go fight pirates, but that gets old quickly. Eventually you find yourself building giant flyswatters and pitting them against Imperial Star Destroyers if you dare to load up the game again.Possibly the only thing interesting about this game is it makes fan fiction possible, who would win, the Enterpise or a Starwars Republic Attack Cruiser, the Serenity or a Varkrey, an F-16 or a TIE fighter? Truthfully thats just about what this game has become due to lack of progress.Don't get me wrong, the game looks interesting, I'm hoping it gets better and finishes strong, but it's looking abandoned and in it's current state isn't worth the $20.

												I bought this game during Early Access because the game looked hugley promising.  This seemed to be the game that would fill the void left in the absence of Elite, Escape Velocity, or a good X game after the abomination that is Rebirth.  Unfortunatley as development trucked along, much more slowly than originally promised at that, features in development began to be cut.  First the scale of the universe was reduced, then the Newtonian physics that were one of the huge selling points of the game were cut in favor of a ""simplified"" traditional flight model that has ships slow down when engines are cut, turn like atmospheric craft, and have velocity rather than acceleration limits (and these limits are VERY small, measured in triple-diget KPH in the enormity of a solar system).The robust mission and faction system never materialized, leaving players with very little more to do than in alpha stages.  Basically you can trade legitimatley, or pirate and sale.  The universe offers almost nothing else to do.  There are no indications of where one can buy and sell items let alone how the prices will fluctuate nor what ship modules will be available until you reach a system in the tiny galaxies generated each new time you start a game.  Even then what faction controls a star system (the number of which can be ajusted when you create a galaxy, but they are nothing more than interchangable names and their influence almost never changes for any reason).The one good thing that I can say about this game is that the ship editor is fairly large.  It was reduced in features since the alpha, again in an attempt to simplify which they failed at anyway, but still offers many options in terms of ship design.  The wide range of vessels both original and copies of famous ships from sci-fi series does attest to this.  Unfortunatley there is nothing to do with your ship other than mindlessly shoot other ships.If you think that Elite: Dangerous doesn't give you enough help in the universe nor enough interaction with the economy, NPCs, or factions, then stay away from this game.  The tutorials, to the VERY limited extent they exist at all, teach you nothing and somehow saying you recieve no guidence manages to be an understatement.  Even the graphics are nothing to write home about.  Actual old games like X3 or Escape Velocity Nova manage to be better at this, and if you want less story and more trade and exploration with a game that looks beautiful check out Elite: Dangerous or keep your eye out for the (as of time of writing) unreleased Star Citizen or No Man's Sky.

												Cool concept, but lacking execution. Not the first nor the last game with this problem. Plus seems like the game has been abandoned, last update in january, and its june now, and the game feels FAR from finished. Feels like there's just enough content for this to be in beta, however lot of the features just seem unfinished, or just carelessly put together with whatever-attitude. Ship building, which feels like being the core idea of this game, feels decent, but unfortunately thats about it for this game.			"

												Updated - 2015-01-01It's even worse now, as soon as i started a new creative sandbox game i'm greeted with a box that says ""we should not see this message"" with a button that you can't really click on (nothing happens). After pressing the x button in the corner of the message i'm greeted with the ship editor, except i have no parts, so i cant build any ships, which means the ship builder (-THE- only strong point of this game) does'nt work anymore. Furthermore i could not load my old ships (wanted to see if i could edit them).If you plan on pushing the game out of early access to a full release atleast make sure your game works. Worst money spent ever. And by far the worst game i ever had the oppurtunity to try out. I don't care if i can or cannot get a refund, i'll try it anyway. Would rather see the company go bankrupt then see this game become complete.--------------------------------Old Review--------------------------------Nope. This game does not get a seal of approval. They tried to sold us a great game with alot of diversity, yet all we got was a sandbox game with no real goal, hard to learn, no multiplayer, no progression... it just drift aimlessly in space.The only thing that speaks for this game is the ship builder, and it aint that fancy. I'd rather just stick with Kerbal Space Program and play that game instead.			"

												Update: This review is rather for an older state of the game. It might not reflect current mechanics and working/not working gameplay.----As of yet the game is unplayable. It is an very early development built. I would even go that far to say that it still is a concept build. A proof of concept. There are some good ideas like building your own ship but the implementation is nearly unusable. I miss distinctions between the modules. If I compare the screenshots to the actual game I didn't get that far because you are simply left alone in the (kinetic) void of the absence of guidance. There is this rule in game development:90% of the games started being developed will never finish. This is one perfect candidate for this rule. Before this ""Early Access"" hype, development of such failed projects where never to be compensated. Today with Early Access you can make $$ despite you will never finish your game.			"

												There's probably a game in here somewhere that I can't find. I don't wish to find it at this point. The game is hidden under a clunky UI and UE in general. UI elements go off the screen with no way to bring them back on (such as the right click menus when flying in space) and the ones that you can control the positions of do not remember their positions. As one of the initial backers for this game's Kickstarter, I really really wanted it to succeed, but as it stands right now, this game is trying to do far too much with a UI that makes little to no sense.

												Bought it while waiting for X Rebirth. It looked promising but was so early alpha that it could not be played at all. But hey Early Access. So I forgot it. A long time after I remembered it and looked it up again. Looked a lot better but still felt like an alpha. I was curious and checked the news and then it hit me...it was the full released version.To rephrase that: A fully released game looks like an alpha version. I was super enraged especially since Egosoft released X Rebirth just before which (for those who don't know) was nothing more than a ""playable"" beta.I have not bought an Early Access game after that anymore.

Early Access Review
								While this game is still in development, it's worth getting into not only for the gameplay but for the potential it shows. I'v spent over 100 hours on Kinetic Void, and I can guarantee I'm going to spend many times that in the future. I strongly recommend getting the game; the developers are easy enough to get in contact with through steam, and you get to be  a part of the process as the game grows. Graphics are good (better than in the video above), gameplay is great, customization is great as well!			"

												Not really a game. Cool shipbuilder. I was told there would be a game, though. I was incredibly shocked when I saw the other day that they are claiming it's out of EA. It's plainly not, they just stopped working on it. Exactly the kind of thing that gives EA games a bad name.Edit: It appears I was wrong to say that the devs had halted work on the game completely, thanks for the correction. As I looked into it it seems they have still been working on some monthly bug fixes and improvements. Though I don't think that any of the things I've seen listed in the change log really implore me to spend more time on the game even if many of the potential features that the devs have stated they'd like to add were to be added in the future, I'm happy to hear that the devs are still putting in some time.While I'm glad to hear that the devs are still working on it, the statement of calling it a 1.00 version as well as the specific avoidance of promises about what will or will not make it into the game still turn me off enough to wish I had put my money somewhere else, though I admit there's an outside chance I could reinstall on a whim in a year or two and be pleasantly surprised.So to sum up, the shipbuilding aspect is very well done and I'd say it's probably a lot less confusing than it might seem at first if you just take a few minutes to adjust yourself. It might still be a little obtuse at times, but you only have to check out the workshop to see how expansive it can be. However, the gameplay to my taste at least, still felt very underpolished and generally uninteresting to the point that I can't have a lot of hope it could ever be anything but outdated at best as of only one patch ago.If I've missed anything, please feel free to let me know so I can correct it.

												Well, I've had the game for a while now and while I would like to say that it was what I had hoped it would be it isn't anywhere near it. When I first started trying out the game I instantly hit a roadblock of ""what are the controls?"". There wasn't much in the way of tutorials and what I did find only helped me to get through the ship building phase. After that I couldn't really do much except for maybe make the ship move forward, at least I think it was going forward. To be honest I just quit playing it because I was hoping that the game would get the needed imnprovements since it was still in early access at that point. I have waited until now and it doesn't really look like much progress has occured and the game is no longer marked as ealy access. While I do get that stuff happens, I feel like this was an over ambitious project that is a bit of a dissapointment with the results. While I can still hope that the devs get it completed and functioning as advertised, I don't see it happening any time soon. I feel that this game might as well be considered dead unless it can get a big revival in the developement.			"

												One of the most interesting articles I have put my hands on lately. The game is now released, a bit prematurely if you ask me, but the dev team is dedicated in their work, pushing out grand ambitions and frequent updates for such a small team. However, it is important to note that this game is the first game ever made by badlands studios.The main selling point of the game is the shipbuilding hangar, where the possibilities of what you can make usually exceeds your own imagination!Long story short: If you like building ships, you will love this game!Did you like building starships with legos as a kid? Buy it. I can promise it's equally addicting!When multiplayer gets introduced, I think this game will stand Solid!			"

												It has the potential to be a great spacesim. But it isn't, yet.It offers the perfect setting to play a Spacepirat, fight ships, blow them up, scavenge parts and wild them to your ship to gain strength. Sounds great, hasn't been there before. But sadly at the moment thats all there is to this game, the creative sandbox modus is nice for building ships but everythign around is lacking.Errors in the UI, for exampel the vendor menue the filters a weapons say EMP, Kinetic, Thermal... truth is, Beam, Projektile and Missile. Poor scaling of UI, you fight like Ace Combat... uh an red icon, klick, uh an red box around the icon and a red sircle and long bevor you can realy see the enemy it goes boom. You do have an targeing window that shows you a miniature of the enemy ship but i was unabel to detect any impact ov my weapon fire on the ship in the window seams that its yout an automatic generatet icon.Beeing a trader is almost imposibel, mining takes for ever and mission reward dosn't scale. Reward for a mission in a fighter gave me 5-10k reward mission in a corvette gave the same.The lift of things they have promised.Let's take small look ^^Fully detailed and customizable space ships.Yes best part of the game, surpasses to my eye customisation in Space Empire and Galactic Civ.Hundreds of weapons and modules of multiple sizes.There are many but to get to hundreads you have to use the Borderlands equation. Existing modules times classes, here 5. Very few klass exclusiv moduls.Fully customizable and adaptable controls for mouse, keyboard, and joystick.Yes its there.Huge procedurally generated galaxy, limited only by your computers capabilities.No it isn't the max sice is 30 systems and 12 factions.Randomized factions and political standings.For the most part. Open world sandbox, you are in control of your fate.Some one has to, the impulses from the world around do not exist. A chat mission every once in a while that tells you about a ""mission"" errand is no impulse.Detailed economy simulation with resources, trade routes and more.There are resources and you get chat messages that tell tales of lost shipment and impact on prices, but i never saw any ship docking at a station ore flying towards a gate for traderouts. The more part, thats the module trader at the station. BTW you can enter 50% of all stations... (there are only two kinds)Epic space combat.Epic means you get swarmd at a random mission by 5 exact copys of your own ship and get blastet out of the universe.Toggleable Newtonian FlightThats there and dose work for the most part. Max speed is caped at two times your normal max speed.Emergent gameplay.Well Space is big and i taked forever to get somewhere and mining an asteroid is pretty boring in real life as well if you sit in your command chair and watch the pretty light from the laser.So they realy more or less fullfilled the conditions on the list. To bad it'S not enough.This is a review you released the game to 1.0 and lost every protection of the EarlyAccses. The Programmers sad we are done its a finished product but it's not. They claim they reached 1.0 but it's not done. But (wow lot of repetition here) If you anounce 1.0 call it a release it has to be done and for every bit it isn't we the comunity are going to scream out in frustration about a nother game broken to the ground.I will look again at the game in the future, and if it becomes better and gets all the missing parts around a good shipyard i promise i will re-review it. But at this stage at this price there can be no recommendation.			"

												This game has been in slow, casual development for years... and needs years more or the same pace. The only reason why the alpha tag was removed and it was taken off early access is, and I quote, ""Because of how early-access games work, keeping it off the store front and preventing sales.""The game is not finished, the developed is a hack and is just scamming you for money.

												Kinetic void sold me on a dream years ago, the first and only early access game I have bought it stands as a warning for those who buy early access. None of the potential was realised and was released feature incomplete, I'm sorry kinetic void I loved the idea of you once but you never capitalised on that idea. Do not buy this game, do not buy any feature incomplete early access game that you are waiting for more features in order to play. Just wait and experience the game how you actually want it. I'd give this game a 1/10 for not just being something someone slapped together in unity.			"

												There is no compelling reason to play this game. Building ships isn't that interesting as there does not appear to be a whole lot of difference in where you place what. Stick as many guns as you can on the front and win.There is no real gameplay, no interesting quests, no real missions, just a hollow world with no real reason to be engaged in it.There are more interesting ship building games such as Gimbal, or even Star Made which is just as incomplete as this game but doesn't claim to be a finished release.If you're looking for a space adventure game, Starport Gemni 2 and the X series are far more interesting.This game offers nothing new besides a clunky ship builder that adds no real value to the game.

Early Access Review
								Interesting in concept, lacking in content. This game has an atmosphere and flight experience that harkens back to the 90s and games like Star Quest I. This really isn't a good thing. On paper, the idea of a game where you can design, build and fly your space ships competely from the ground up the way you want them, is fantastic... but after spending a few hours messing around in the the game I couldn't even figure out what to do in the game, much less how to start building my own ship. The 'guide' was bare-bones at best and the interface was clunky and frustrating. As an early access game, some growing pains are expected, but this feels a lot less like a playable alpha and more like an unfinished engine with nothing to do in it. My recommendation is to skip this one for now and maybe check back later to see if things have improved before buying.			"

								Mostly just a creative shipyard (very well done) with a terrible flight mechanic and star-trading aspect attached to it.  Granted, this is only Early Access, I would like to see it get better.  However, it is shaping up to be a game that not too many star trading fans would like.  Go purchase Starpoint Gemini 2 or one of the other star traders out there.  If you're uncreative and just want this for the space aspect, don't bother.			"

												I picked this game up again recently, thinking it was still in Pre-alpha phase, but have just now read in another review that it is actually already released as a full game. To put it simply, I noticed no improvements that blew me away enough to even notice that this was the finished game, even after forgetting i owned this game and reinstalling it. I particularly don't like the way the ship-building interface is; it looks cheap and ugly. The game as a whole is difficult for me to play, as the controls seem nearly as ambiguous as what I should even be doing. I don't think I'm a terribly picky person, I understand a game does not need to rely heavily on complex themes or dazzling art styles and graphics to be playable, but this seems to be one of those games where it looks so sloppily put together, that it puts me off from wanting to even humor what gameplay is present. To tie a bow on it, I don't believe this game has any real potential anymore, so i don't recommend that anyone purchase it, and I regret buying it.			"

Early Access Review
								Preface: I've been asked by the game's developer to change my review, which follows as such.Tedious and unimersive come to mind when playing this game for any amount fo time, caused by a textwall tutorial system that definetly doesn't hand-hold the player at all, so you'll be devoting a hell of a lot of time reading away.It's not a game that you want to get into if you expected a fun, light Kerbal Space Program-like game, especially with the myriad of controls.If you were looking for a boring version of the X3 franchise, you've found it, with the added extra of: an unintuitive UII'm not going to directly attack the developer, however his attitude towards bad reviews leaves more to be desired. He should also note that threats to involve community moderators in order to coerce a good review do not work on me, and I still think this game is pretty abysmal.			"

												This game is sadder than ""The Stomping Land"", because at least that game isn't for sale anymore.  Seriously it would have been better if you had just abandoned the game during early access, which is essentially what you've done, but if it still had the EA tag, I would at least have an interesting story to tell my friends about how you developers ran away before the full release.  gg			"

Whilst I can do that, the game is apparently 'fully released', it just does not feel like a completed game. I mean, the only thing good about this game is the ship builder and even that could use some improvement.			"

A sob story, for sure - weep not for the Dev team, but for those who've already bought this 'game'.It's still fun customizing your own ship and all that, but the gameplay is rather lacking, and there are a heck of a lot of features missing that were previously announced.Really sad to see this game flail miserably and die out, but that's the risk you take buying Early Access.TL:DR -- Nope.

Early Access Review
								When I first launched Kinetic Void, I was met with something that had a smell of bad UI... It turned out I was right! It was pretty obvious that I had to create a new galaxy to satrt playing, and then I just selected the starter ship. When it came to adding additional parts to the ship, it was VERY, and I repeat VERY confusing. The controls and ship building is horrible! I have a feeling I would have a better time playing Guise of the Wolf. When i looked at the game guide to find the controls, they didn't bloody work!It has an intresting concept that could have made a great game, but with what I'm seeing now... That's probably never goind to happen.BTW: I got a headache playing this game, not because it was making me dizzy, but because I was so confused!			"

Early Access Review
								I should preface this by asking you to ignore my hours in this game. I played quite a bit of it offline and apparently Steam doesn't track hours spent offline.I've said it before and I'll say it again: One of the most damning words you can use to describe a video game is ""potential"". With almost all of the absolute worst games of the last generation, ""potential"" was the best word people could use to describe them. Duke Nukem Forever, The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct, X-Rebirth, these all had massive potential and that is part of why they were considered such disappointments. If ""potential"" is the best word you have to describe a game, that game has failed, Early Access or no. And sadly, that is the best word I can use to describe Kinetic Void.I first picked up this game last year in May, actually getting it with a Steam card gifted to me for my birthday. I should've bought something else. This game barely had any content at the time, even for an Early Access game. Earlier this year Earth: Year 2066 was released in Early Access and was massively criticized for having next to no content and that's about what the game was like when I first bought it. You had access to plenty of ship customizations and...that was about it. Then you flew around in a very pretty screenshot area and then you stopped. That was about it. Rarely enemies would appear and then you would attack them in broken combat. Or maybe you went to a ship drydock (which it takes like 4 years to reach, more on that later) and found out that you couldn't dock. I get it, it's Early Access and things are gonna be buggy and broken, but when there's only 3 things to do in your game, you would expect those 3 things to actually work to some degree. So instead it turned into a pretty screenshot game and nothing more.Moving around in this game in absolutely awful. It takes FOREVER to reach anywhere. I get it, space is big but this is a video game, you are allowed to cut down on size if it makes the game more accessable and fun. Even in FTL mode it still feels like it takes ages to move around, up until you stop paying attention and crash into a planet. Scratch that, you never crash unless you're shot down, so all you do is clip through solid landmasses, whether it's a planet, a moon or a space station, you just clip through it.This could have been fixed by either cutting down on the size and scope to something more manageable or to include more things that happen along the way. Encountering Space Pirates (If the combat worked), seeing two fleets battling each other, encountering a stranded merchant ship, these all could have helped it not feel so empty and boring. As is, the exploration feels less like the magic and wonder of something like Skyrim and making me feel more like this: 


YouTube™ Video: ▶ Deadpool so boring  Make it stop 

			Views: 16,474		

			public use.deadpool is owned by marvel deadpool, deadpool the game Highmoon studios		

I haven't checked up too often on this game since then, I haven't really felt like revisiting this slog of a space explorer but after a years worth of updates I decided to revisit it. It isn't that much better now, sadly. After a year of updates it still feels the same to me, a bit like the difference between the DayZ mod and standalone: Months and months of work and nothing seems to have changed. Things are indeed different, but nothing big is different. Combat is still broken to the point of being unplayable and exploration still takes several millenia to ever do anything at all. Sorry kids, but until further notice, ""potential"" is the best word I can come up with for this game and ""boring as hell"" is the worst. Not recommended at all, only spend your money if you want to fund the development cycle. Otherwise, there's too many games for you to buy that desrve your money for you to waste any on this slog of a game.			"

												I have this game since the early access. The general idea is very interesting, but with tons of unfinished things, many bugs and so, i've waited for the early access stage to end.Now, with time to check again and because the game was officially released, in my opinion, the game's still a complete mess. The problems and bugs in the docks (where you put your ship parts together) remained there and i think that the UI is worse. I'm not sure, but trying to place the ship parts where you want, seems to be much more difficult than before.I wasn't able to check if the navigation/combat system was improved or at least fixed. The game keep crashing to desktop very often while in the dock. It didn't happen before, while the game was in early access.At least for now, i give up. I'm gonna wait for another major update patch and then I'll try again.Because of that, i can't recommend this game as it is.*****************************************************************************************************************UPDATEWell, this game is dead for sure now.The dev simply abandoned the game and gave us a great and loud ""F*** YOU"" while run off with our money. People say that the dev don't even reply any kind of contact anymore.Steam should be more responsible for letting this happen and give the money back to the clients. Afterall, they allowed this dev to sell their game while they had no capability or intention to keep working on the game.Obviously, this will not happen because Steam doesn't reeeally cares about clients too, but at least they should took this example (saddly, not the only one here on Steam) and formulate a more tight policy to verify which dev can or cannot be sold here.I know we are just clients, but a little bit of respect wouldn't hurt.

												The game, as it is right now, is a ship builder. It is still in alpha and there should be more to come (I hope) but so far what i've seen of just the ship building has been worth the money I spent. Not only can you build a full ship from bits and pieces but also install subsystems into each part that you use to build the ship. If the rest of the game has as many options as the builder did, I think it may even beat the X3 series. Alpha Rating: 7/10			"

												It saddens me immensley to say this.... The game is escentially dead. The dev, for all we know, ran off his own team, spent the money on a bunch of other games, and seemed to give up on KV completely.The game is dead-- please.... Please, don't get this game. I beg of you, don't. There's nothing more for it to offer.... Not anymore...I'm sad now.Also, I asked the dev what went wrong. All I wanted was an update saying ""Sorry for the lack of updates, life happened and now [insert excuse here]."" But he refused and banned me from the forums for saying it hurts that he won't tell us anything anymore. Do NOT buy this game. The dev is a dirty as my back yard.			"

												i bought the game back when the construction had snap points (and am very disipoined that they removed them)the game had alot of great ideas yet it is far from the game i was hopeing for when i spent my $20.00 on it.the construction system is ok but could be far better if there were an option to toggle snap points, less odd shaped pieces, better size scaleing. the game play feels lacking there is nearly no objectives basicly biuld your ship and die by pirates manly because they dont give you enough starter parts to protect yourself.the starter parts they give you in that poor exuse they call a career mode is a random shuffle of teir 1 parts and they give you up to 20ish components total consiting of atleast one command pod, one hull segment, two weapon mounts and weapons, one-three engines of varying types, and an assortment of subsystems.it is slightly better in sandbox as you get all the parts in infinite ammounts however there is no point to play as everythaing is there for you to use alredy hell no mans sky is more complete then this.if you want space exploration and construction that has a point... or at least more of a point DO NOT BUY this. get starmade or space engineers			"

I figured I'd wait several months and see if it matured.I haven't re-downloaded it, but judged by the ratings and the fact that the Game's website is no longer available I'd say this was abandoned.

												This game has kind of a sad history.  It looked REALLY good when it was on early access, and had a few people's support, but beyond the ship design most of it was clunky and hard to understand or manage.  I had a game once where I built a big ship and the only thing I could do was go into warp drive, because the other controls besides turning didn't seem to work.  I essentially hung dead in space.I got this game for the ship design.  While it has an unfinished feel to it, the ship building looks cool enough and a lot of it had a bunch of potential.  I myself will likely install it once or twice just to build some ships again so that I get a visual idea for something for a much better game, like say Space Engineers.  Beyond that, however, I probably will never play it again.  It was a waste of potential.  Kind of wished that the devs put more effort into it...or at the very least got some help in finishing the game.Sad day.  I hate making negative reviews.			"

Best way to explain it currently is it's SPORE for ships but remove objectives and any questing. There are bugs from what was attempted to be fixed which wasn't broken. $20 down the hole. i hope there is a hell for devs who abandon and leave kickstarters hanging...			"

								The main problem I have with the game is an utter lack of direction.  Specifically how to move.  It took me longer then it should have to figure out that the space bar is your acceleration.Next problem is the lack of a tutorial when it comes to ship making.  The way it is currently set up is simply ""Heres your hanger, have fun"".  What would help would be a tutorial option with ship making.Another tutorial that would help would be one dealing with space combat.  Enimies can snipe me from almost 30 Km away where as I can not see them at all.  That was after I figured out that Z actives your guns, but I still don't know what the other indicators on the center dial are.Okay, how to improve.  First a tutorail on some basic controls (movement, weapon selection, and the like), building your ship and space combat.  Until these are ironed out I can not recomend this game.			"

												This game was an achievement when it came to building your own really nice looking space ships, and all the different modules, details and work put into that system. Bought the game in early access because I really liked that concept and there was some cool♥♥♥♥♥looking ships in the workshop. Unfortunately development seemed to slow, and seemingly out of nowhere I saw it on Steam's main store page being that it was fully released version 1.0, After full release I tried playing the game, and could not for the life of me figure out how factions or missions worked at all. It seems that all the actual gameplay elements were rushed out and are not user friendly at all. It sucks, and I know that's the risk of early access. But I don't know how someone could take money from people in support of a product they're making and on the home stretch just throw it out there in such an unspectacular state. I understand that if you run out of money and the game's not selling due to its poor reviews, you've gotta get a day job. At least work towards making it a fun and accessible game in your free time from then on! Maybe in due time you'd get a chance to redeem yourself and your game and you'd start getting some sales, but whatever man. I guess♥♥♥♥♥♥happens. Could've been a great game.			"

Early Access Review
								Bear in mind this is still an incomplete game at this stage, so I will only review what feels like the most complete section, ship building.Honestly I was a little hesitant at first, I have had other games where you can make your own content fail to deliver misserably, and I am a huge fan of making my own things my own way.After getting to grips with placing the modules properly (which takes some time and mistakes) I completely forgot the time and before I knew it I had spent a whole evening making my first ship, which I was very proud of.With some time and dedication you can make some fantastic creations with this even at this stage of development, it only takes a quick look on the workshop to see people who have made some really special things already, even a gaint mech!This is already a fun game for those who enjoy the construction element in particular, the rest of the game is only really complete enough to take your creation for a joy ride and test out the fighting capabilities.That said if the completed game has the same level of effort put in to its construction this could be a masterpiece waiting to happen...Only buy at this point if you like games where you can make your own creations, and if you remember this is a game very much in development, do not expect a polished and complete experience yet!

												Very ambitious game with a *very* emphatic NOPE. The website still sells it as early access. Last update was over a year ago as of this writing. It states:  For a while now, our biggest problem has been a lack of content once you’ve built your ship, and an in-depth economy    will be a major factor in creating a living world for the player to interact with. This week’s patch includes an early implementation that should give you a basic idea of where we want to go with it. So basically with the final release, we have an ""early implementation"" of a ""basic idea"" for the economy. I'm certainly not trying to be antagonistic here, but that just seems blatantly wrong to me. It feels pretty deceitful to sell a product as complete when it has clearly not been finished. I really wanted to like it. It was one of the first early-access titles I've purchased and I admit, the ship builder is pretty fun. Flying your ship, or interacting with the universe on any meaningful level seems non-existant. Combat is boring and janky, the economy sim is incomplete, and the whole thing reeks of alpha. For clarification, alpha as in the pre-beta stage, beta meaning the game is feature complete and only requires bug fixing, optimization, and testing. In essence I'm saying that things are missing. Overall, once you finish building your ship, you may as well just quit the game; it's peaked. That was the high point, that was the single most fun thing that you will ever do in this game. It's just boring. Obviously, no developer sets their sights on making a boring game. I'm not mad, I understand money and motivation don't last forever, but this game really should have been *so* much more than what is offered. The procedural random galaxy and shipbuilder alone must have been truly momental tasks to overcome. I don't know what happened with the devs (the forums are malfunctioning or have been removed as of this writing), but it's genuinely as though they just vanished. If and when they do return, I hope that they will learn from their mistakes and move on.			"

Oh, well. It appears to be an abandoned project at this point. If you can get it for the option to build your own ship and fly it around do so on the cheap...this is not worth the 2$20 US.

								The ship builder is damned impressive, and having Steam Workshop in place so early is fantastic.I have to admit that I'm not playing this game a whole lot right now, but am happy to have supported the devs as the updates are flowing well, and when this is finished it should be one hell of a game!

								Though it had a slow start - the growth of this game is amazing. It has gone from being one of the best ship building experiences to actually forging a world that you can take that ship and become someone in the galaxy, and the updates seem to actually have momentum to them. Graphics for an indie game are amazing, and the effort the team puts into it is extraordinary.			"

Early Access Review
								It was as if EVE Online and Kerbal Space Program had a baby, and that baby was a total badass. Build your ship to be whatever you desire and explore, fight, and be an interstellar accountant(I know that that may not sound fun, but it worked out great for EVE.) inside a beautiful universe which for some reason has awesome music playing in the backround. NPCs will call for your help, maybe ambushing you with three or four enemy ships. The reqirement specs are quite low, I know because I have a 720p 2009 iMac, and the framerate is pretty smooth at max settings. If you listen to the devs, then you can tell that they really care about Kinetic Void. This game has tons of potential, and I think that it's going to deliver. And if you don't like the game, then GLaDOS will give you cake!			"

								this game is single player EVE on drugs, it gives yo an open world ie: space: and allows you to build your own ships! only down sides: still in beta/alpha still is selling for funding. and would be awsome if multi player, but its not... games fun and the dynamics of game play make it interesting. im sure in a year or two this game will be the future of space rpg's, but at the moment its lego space the single player MMO. as in this game is big enuff to be an MMO but it is sigle player.

								Good space game with some physics and FULLY customizable ships. Vast universe with solar systems.This game is a perfect combination of realistic space and good gameplay. There is not many games if any that have these parameters. Some have very realistic space physics (like KSP), some has very detailed ship designs. This game is a perfect combination of a lot of space simulators. You can say, that they have found a balance when the game is very detailed and still very fun to play.			"

Early Access Review
								I dont even know what to say about this. its no where near the point of being playable. i know its early access but its broken. id say wait a long time before spending any money on it. EDIT: alright allow me to add a little. you only get one chance to build your ship after creating the galaxy. the controls are okay but if you dont do it perfectly the first time, your ship will just continue to explode upon starting the game forcing you to restart over and over again. the ship building is just okay. nothing special like it sounded. i know it is SPACE but everything is too far and few inbetween to be entertaining or fun. ships are slow and measure speed in a different measurement (M/S) than distance on the hud (KM) the most i could really do is kind of build a ship and kind of fly around untill inevitably quiting due t frustration of having t start over any time i spent making a ship or galaxy.

												Kinetic Void started off as a really good idea for a game. 100% open world, pure 'do-as-you-wish' ship construction and exploration.That's about all the good I can say about it.The dev team was really small, inexperienced, and although they were pretty active in the community and media, the game itself fell short by many expectations. There are still a lot of bugs, no actual tutorial, ship building in itself is pretty complicated, and the game overall is not really well optimized.When it boiled down to release I started to regret my purchase as despite the fact it's no longer Early Access, the game itself still feels largely incomplete. Buggy, no tutorial whatsoever, still not well optimized to run, and the ship building, although the interface is better, it still is really complicated a workflow overall. Not even the missions would work correctly. Which was a pain.Of course, having already purchased this game I decided to cling on and hope for the best, but then suddenly, the game went quiet on all mediums: forum, update schedule, and youtube.The entire dev team dropped out of the KV project, pretty much leaving only 2 behind. While it's more of a lack of interest than a 'take money and run' scheme (funds went to dev salaries), the 2 developers that DID stay behind, as much as I'd like to applaud them, can't do much either, not when they are also trying to work on a side project to make ends meet.I bought the game with high hopes that were never repaid. If you're here looking for a space sandbox, there are other, much better games that haven't been abandoned and left to rot in the pits of Steam. Don't buy this. It was never worth the $20, and never will be.			"

												Backed this game more than a year and it was pretty much empty. I loved the concept and bought it. Came back a year later just to find out it's a disaster and the devs stopped working on it. Half the team chose to stop working on it and left the studio, and the two remaining devs need to eat so they work on a different side project. At least they are honest and told us why the game probably will never achieve the level promised years ago. At least they didn't run off with the money. It's about not having enough resources to go on.Two or three years ago I would have said what I was thinking back then : ""The future of gaming will be brought through kickstarters and indie inspiration. Big companies don't care anymore"". Today, the situation has changed. Bad devs ruined the system and the trust we had at the beginning. A majority of projects never achieve the features promised during the founding phase and run away with everyones money, leaving the game in a bad condition. This has to stop.Bottom line : amazing concept that never made it to release, despite the product being labeled as finished. I know this will not help the devs finish it, buy as it is today (v1.0.xx), it's not worth a buy :/			"

												Kinetic void, watched the video read the forums in very early access (2013). Realised that it had massive potential bought the game. Played it, shelved it and like many others waited for a better game to come to pass.What Ive learnt since then, again like many others, I'll watch the video read the comments look at game play, read dev blogs and decide (usually correctly) that the game in question is just too over ambitious and throw my money at something else. Now the dev's are a smaller team this is one of the games that, personally, cant seen to be ever finished to the point where I could turn around and say ""buy this"".The game is difficult to get into, difficult to play because it still is and possibly awlays be an unifnished product. Dont treat this as a full release (it pushed out of early access for many reason im sure).Love building ships? (great looking too), Love flying em about with partially completed gameplay? Then buy it.looking for something that doesnt require a lot of reading up on tutorials, bug workarounds and shallow gameplay then sorry, just look somewhere else.What money I did spend on this game helped me save huge amounts of cash not spent on other early access games no matter how good the sales pitch is. So every cloud and all that...			"

												I loved this game, and at times I would just spend hours designing the perfect ship of my dreams, giving each module a story and a purpose.  I would launch out in to space and sail in its vastness engaging in combat with the surrounding AI.. and this is where the fun really ends. I first bought this game when it released into Early Access. It was my last 20 bucks, and I sat there clenching my virtual steam funds... finally giving in. Kinetic Void looked like a very good game, the updates were coming fast, people were hyped showing each other their creations and the lore behind them.  Even a member of the Yogscast posted a video depicting the gamer designing and testing out a ship in his created system.I played almost constantly, seeing what I could make next, and admiring other peoples' hard and dedicated work as well.  But then, suddenly the game is ""released"". I was quite shocked, I knew this couldn't be true... the game was a broken mess, did they finally refine the faction and trading system?  Is the combat more fluid and less buggy?  It seems they really haven't.  They left a note at the door. I was devastated, waiting two years in anticipation for all of these features.  I scanned the forums, witnessing developers deleting threads and banning customers asking sincere questions.  It saddens me, and I really thought this game was going to be a success, remembering the hype and positive feedback of the game in its Early Access release.  Hopefully other developers won't follow in their footsteps, but unfortunately it happens frequent enough.  Cheers.			"

												Despite the negative reviews I decided it looked like the kind of game I would really enjoy... To be honest, I can't tell you if I enjoy the game or not, since I can't get past just how counter intuitive the ship building interface is. All I want to do is mirror a damn part. You have the tool, you click it, and as for mirroring? lets see, if by some miracle you do manage to get them to mirror.... they will be offset on the z axis, so they just wont align, and can you switch between the parts to do fine adjustment, nope, that button doesn't seem to do a damn thing. Either it's just not meant to do that, or whatever, but that's what I would think it would do... Dear devolopers, have you ever used any 3d modeling software? do you have any idea what 'mirror' means? I have spent the last hour since downloading it, trying to make a mirror image of a hull part. that's all I want to do. As it is, I'm going to just slap a bunch of parts together, throw some engines on it and call it good. I really hope that the actual game play isn't as counter intuitive as the ship building interface. Save your money folks, even on sale it isn't worth what I paid for it. Games are supposed to be fun, relaxing, enjoyable. Not vexing to the point of making any possible enjoyment moot.Update: After another 3 hours of messing with the ship designer, I figured out a few tricks to actually make the parts line up as a mirror image of eachother, but naturally, it is not how you'd think you'd be able to pull it off. Anyways made the ship, launched, got a mission message, and it was very vague.Managed to mine the required materials, and now I have no idea where to take them...Suggestion for the developer, go play Freelancer. Compare what you attempted to do with the 'freelance' mode of the game. get a mission, it tells you where to go, add a module, it shows what it does, how it affects everything.The KV interface is crap. It's a nice idea, but there's too much of the wrong information, and not enough of the right information. Buttons get hidden, the touch location changes, little bugs, that are obnoxious. It's nice that it's an open sandbox, and you get to choose where you get to go and when you go there, but what's the point if the game expects you to guess where you're suppoed to go to?Save your money, and your frustration.

												DO NOT BUY THIS TITLE!This game in unfinished, and currently development is being halted on this project.There are currently NO people working on this project who can finish it.The game has been taken off of early access prematurely, as there are still bugs and problems with the game.But according to the dev the games core features are done, BUT taking it off of early access makes it so people who block early access people will still see the title and might buy it.In the devs own words.http://imgur.com/yb8TKtW""I don't currently have a development team and the programming is beyond my skill range.""""we are currently working on a side project in our spare time to hopefully generate more revenue""Keep in mind this game was a kickstarter project, AND a pay in early access title.Kickstarter goals and funds are supposed to be the amount needed to make this games a reality, but even with kickstarter funds AND steam release and money, this project has been halted.I do not believe the dev when he claims this game is finished and no longer needs to be in an early access state.I really do feel for these indie developers.It's something I aspired to myself at one time, so I can really feel for them when it comes to money problems like this.But the big issue right now is that this project has failed, sometimes projects fail, and you cannot expect people to cover your♥♥♥♥♥and throw money at you for something that has already failed once with the funds given.Do NOT support this game, there is absolutely no reason to because from what the dev says this game needs those funds to continue on being developed in the first place.Which means unless you have a few 100 friends willing to toss money into this hole, your money will just go to waste buying this game.This game already went down that path with kickstarter, it doesnt need another kickstarter, it needs to be removed from steam and closed down.

Early Access Review
								The developer literally lies to your face about features (at least when I bought it) by advertising that they're in the game already, when it turns out that these important and advertised features are yet to be added. The excuse here? ""It's only early access."" Early access my @ss, you advertised these to be in the game, not waiting for it in a future update. I also hear that this is 2 years after the kickstarter. This feels like one of those 1-2 week game challenges except like less than half complete.			"

								Once I had finally built a ship capable of travel at a reasonable speed, I immediately set about exploring. Unfortunately, my exploration didn’t yield a much asides from occasional distress calls from ships that moved too fast for me to do anything to help. The first (potential) release from Badland Studios has a lot of potential, but in its current incomplete state, Kinetic Void is nothing but confusing and frustrating.For the segment on Kinetic Void. visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2013/10/11/early-access/ "

												It's a shame because this game has so much potential. The only thing good I have to say about this is that the ship creator is bloody brilliant. Real customisation to exactly where you want your weapons, cockpit, engines etc. If it's going cheap it's worth a go just to build a few ships and get really creative.   Outside the space station though. MEH. There isn't really anything to do. If you're lucky a mission might pop up, and you're even luckier if you're properly equipped to do it. Icons of asteroids litter the screen with no real method of filtering other than 'HUD off'. and the game lacks any real.. anything. So.. Mining the identical poo drop shaped asteroids over and over again for money gets boring very quickly, and for some reason they just explode when you've mined them. This tiny ship can blow up an item that is probably kilometers wide.. with.. mining lasers. NOPE.     Planets are empty and don't even have names.. There's no one really to talk to, at all. Would have been nice to hail other ships even if it was just for trading. The little cockpit man that pops up every time you fart or blink gets irritating, just text would have sufficed for the 60th Silicates you mined.     After nearly 3 years of development I'm severely disappointed. Yeah some aspects are good. But it's not playable and it's not a game. What a joke.			"

												Here's a really good example of why Steam GreenLight usually doesn't work as planned. Originally I invested in this game for the idea, knowing full well it would be a while before development finished. However, the stunning slowness and absolute lack of proper patching didn't even remotely keep me interested to boot up the game. The few hours I messed around with it showed promise, especially in the ship building aspect. Unfortunately, this is real life -- developers get lazy, lose motivation, perhaps funding gets cut. This is exactly why Steam GreenLight was a failure. In retrospect, it's a good idea -- sometimes developers need help or the extra customer funding to push their game to the max. Keen Software is a good example of how to do it; they engage in their community very often, an update is out once every 1-2 weeks reflecting some sort of desire or functionality customers wanted, and it is well-recieved and fleshed out to be a game of its own. Badland Studio had promises, but fell short; a disappointment of a company at best.			"

												Normally I'm interested in getting in on a game before it's considered ""finished,"" but it's been waaaay too long since there's been any substantive updates (or any updates at all for that matter). There are a lot of folks out there calling these guys ""cheats"" or some permutation of such, and I have to say I think that's unfair. I don't think they went into this planning to cheat anyone. Lots of folks dream about making great games, but there are so many things that have to come together to make that happen, and sometimes all it takes is one or two things falling apart. That said, I can't recommend something this unfinished, though it looked like the vision here was pretty grandiose, maybe too much so? If it's on sale for less than $5, you might buy it, build some ships, download some modded ships, and play around a bit, but don't go into it expecting Elder Scrolls in space or anything of that nature. I've been in the market for a good space sim and the best I've found is Starpoint Gemini 2, (and even that's not quiiiite what I was hoping for) so if you're reading this, you might go take a look at that instead. Is it a low blow or improper to recommend another game during a review? Maybe? If through some miracle this game ever gets finished, I will absolutely come back here and edit this review.			"

Early Access Review
								As most reviews have said up to now, KV is in Early Access, and thus has a long way to go. That being said, the fact that it does have a ways to go is less of a reminder than something to look forward to(as is often the case in Early Access games) as this game is remarkably whole. You generate a universe, build a ship(or if that's not your thing there are plenty of perfectly fine pre-built ships), and launch it into space. You fly around vaporizing enemies(or getting vaporized...you'll learn your limitations very quickly) and completing missions, and, if your hull is about to crumble or you decide you can do better with the design, you return to the ship yard and make adjustments. As it stands, the missions do need work, as they are random and can become repetitive, and the help center and be opaque to people starting out, but for those looking for a space sim because of exactly what it is: a sim, this game is excellent.

								This game is like X2 mixed with EVE but far less intuitive, if that is possible. Tutorial was worse than X, which is a bit more complicated, yet taught me how to play. This game has potential in the ship building process but adds little to no instruction on how to do so. The ship building could rise above other games but doesn't help you to design your first ship properly. The controls after my ship lauched resemble EVE with less instructon. I guess the sale on 5ish dollars represent its competiveness.I am not happy with my purchase.			"

That said, kudos to the game developer, because it is not easy to make games - certainly even this one.  However, this game is a perfect example of how an indie game can be overhyped (and overpriced), thus racheting up people's expectations.  On the back-drop of so many other space games (and even the re-release of some classics) I see no reason to recommend this game.  If anyone does like this game they owe it to the developer and all of steam to explain themselves.			"

								As of now, I cannot personally RECOMMEND that any consumer should buy this game for entertainment. Not in its current early access state. However! I can say that this game is currently moving on rails to success. After you read this review, please buy the game to show the developers some financial and informational support. Now to the actual game itself!Graphical aesthetics are great and match with the atmosphere. The soundtracks are perfect for inducing that soothing yet unsettling feel of colossal space. planets, and that vibrant, atmosphereic scifi feel.  Listen to it here. That is a reason that I was seduced into buying the game. As always, its the screenshots or cover of that book that you should not judge yet. As I segwayed further into the game, I was brought along a smooth road to introduction. The tutorial is a large ingame wiki, however I hope remake it into a more clever tutorial system. Well all hate tutorials that makes us feel like we are accomplishing nothing; I think virtually all of them are like that. It is hard not to do so. Skyrim did a good job with their tutorial. It was taught well as you were contributing to the story and felt a sense of accomplishment through it as you gt your first weapons, and always wanted to know who would live or die and what would happen next.

												When I bought this game a few months ago i expected it to change a lot and wanted to give the devs some support to make their vision come true. Little did i know that a few patches later the Alpha suddenly would become a final release with almost no changes to the state of the game since i bought it. This is early access done wrong, it feels like an unfunny joke.			"

												Had promise but no.  Got this in alpha on sale which was smart.  Ship building increadible complex, enought that ALL (actually 99%) my playtime has been trying to build a ship. then I got out of the hanger and holy heck no FPS at all.  For comparison my computer can play final fantasy 14 and battlefield 4 so beyond recommended specs.  So after 5 minutes of being out of the hanger I shelved it.If you want to buy it wait for a sale and pick it up for less than $2.50 otherwise avoid this game like the plague.			"

Early Access Review
								Excellent custom ship builder. Though the sub-systems are a bit tricky to locate. Space is big, open, and empty. Ship to ship combat seems ok, though the trading aspect is a bit confusing. Controls and UI not too terrible, though some further explanation or a tutorial would greatly improve things.Could use a better mission system. Repeatedly saw messages pop up without any way to know where the mission was, or who the target was. Only missions seem to be combat based. Planet based stations would be a nice addition, though maybe I just didn't find any.Overall, this is a fun game, but I don't see myself spending a great deal of time on it as it is.			"

You can build ANY design of ship you like or imagine, a small drone up to a huge fregate, how big? your choice, how it looks? your choice, does it have weapons or is a trading ship? your choice! you can even make a station that will not move but will be a trading station.

I am still unsure of how to take over sectors and what my faction is actually called. At 10 hours I stopped caring for who is friend and who is foe. I live the Pirate path now destroying anything with an hp bar. Drones still do not return to my ship and they simply dissapear... very frustrating when I wish to do a Mass Warp Drive(MWD). Many abbriviations in the hanger are confusing and I have given up on trying to debriviate them. At 15 hours I still cant figure out most of the game play and there are these updates that I am not really seeing on my game. Certain Screen shots of the Shipyard and what not, that are very refined and look way easier to navigate do not seem available. Also options for subsystems like the new crew option and what not are eluding me. I still love the game and the idea for its future. I cant wait to see how everything pans out because I forsee me playing this game for a significant amount of time.			"

You build your ship then boom your in the game fly anywhere and you can destroy everything in your path or be nice and cruise around the galaxy. It's YOUR journey, YOU decide.			"

There is no tutorial on how to do anything, there is a keybinding page but that only helps so much. my first combat encounter involved me trying to figure out well how do i shoot the person, and then they rammed me and i exploded.Second time around i figured out how to get a targeting reticle to manually fire but thats pretty much useless .Lastly and i hope they fix this, is your ship feels like its at the end of a stick with how the camera feels. Im sure many of my complaints would be resolved with a joystick but the lack of any kind of tutorial makes it very difficult to do anything			"

								Very cool concept.  Waiting for future updates to see how many different ships we can build right out of the gate.  Ship controls are kinda janky, and in my opinion, flies much too slow for a game with farming as an option, but still a work in progress, so not jumping to conclusions yet.  Seen some ships people have built and I'll probably play this game nonstop, once its fully completed.    The creation bay is perfect, but some additions to making pieces slightly less adjustable would be nice for a tighter fit.  Sometimes it looks right from one angle, but wrong from another.  Other than that, its way more fun than it should be to mess around with.			"

I have seen people build giant Mechs out of the parts and thats freaking amazing with that kinda of stibuility that this game has i give it a 9 out of 10 because the game guide doesnt give you all the controls or that i have seen and second would be nice to have a dedicated surver to play with your friends and go up against them with your builds			"

												Building my first ship was fun. It had a couple issues, namely that they gave you too many free parts instead of, say, a budget and a store, but it was fun to put a ship together from scratch(ish, it is modular after-all). But you hit launch with every anticipation and you get. . . ugh.X3 and Eve Online, pick solo or MMO and go play, because this? Not worth the time. To be perfectly honest, I warped to an asteroid, started mining, looked around empty space for a few minutes, realized how long mining was going to take, adn then? Then I realized the 'world' was far too empty to have anything to do with, to spend that kind of time waiting, especially without at least a chat-box to pass the time! Seriously, I cannot understand why games that cannot compete with such old predecessors keep getting released. The best game to come out since either of those was S.P.A.Z. . . which isn't exactly the same kind of game really, but it does the job. So, you could buy that instead as well. It isn't so much with the full-immersion 'you are your ship' exploration thing, but it is a solid game.			"

								UPDATE /// 8-22-14Game as far as construction of ships is far more functional than when I first got the game if not buggy and great strides have been made in this area to make it approachable. However once you get into the game itself the fundimental problems with the game shine through again.  Kinetic Void tries to reinvent the space sim wheel by making it square.  Controls are overly complicated for flight and space feels empty. Both of these problems have been solved by games made over a decade ago like Freelancer. Mouse flight needs to be implemented better. Warp gates need to be added to define sections of space. Weapons need to feel more powerful and stand out more. Procedural galaxies need to be dropped and replaced with a designed galaxy unless they can make them interesting which they currently are not. I could go on and on about how this game ignores problems that have been solved by older, better games.My suggestion... save your money. Early Access games either have good bones that need to be fleshed out or they're like Kinetic Void where all they have is a good idea but no idea how to impliment it into a good game.---------------------------------------This game is garbage it's barely even a game at the moment. I wish I could get my money back. :(			"

								First of all I may say that this game was a great surprise. When you start playing you will get stuck easily. You may think that the game isn´t worth but after playing couple of hours you discover the power of this tool.That incredible capital ships you ve always dreamed of while watching star wars or star trek, now they will become real. Thanks to the 5 sized parts avaliable to combine you are able to design from the smallest fighter to the largest cruiser.Even animation is not fully ended and enviroment needs developing, the experience of building ships is already enjoyable and quite fun.Even being a game in alpha is a necessary game for those who enjoy not only space strategy but also a creative enviroment of fighting with your own ship.

								This game suffers just as much as it benefits from Early Access. A true Alpha build currently, this has yet to put together gameplay elements in a way that forms a game.I'm loathe to recommend against it though, as the elements I'm seeing are exactly what I want this game to use, and once things come together this could easily be one of the top ""Must Play"" space explorations.If you're willing to invest some time and money to test this, go for it. If you're looking for a good game that's just barely Early Access, try somewhere else.			"

								So, I came into the store one day, and while I was looking through the gaming archives for a new passtime, this popped up. I looked at the reviews, they didn't turn out too bad, so I took an immediate interest due to the pictures and effective wording done by the game developers of how it works, and also because of its' high praise by other players. So I bought, and downloaded it.After starting the game, a series of menus (the game played without much lag at all, it seems to be very effectively coded) that brought me to the ship creation menu. The whole thing was obviously still in development, as is the whole game, so I wasn't fazed. So far, it seems to have a solid menu system, and I love and hope that they try to make a little more sense of the icons, numbers, subsystems and such, because it wasn't all clear as to what they did, or meant, or how they affected the ship.So, after a few minutes of confused silence, I decided to choose one of the pre-made ships, and set off on my journey through space.I had fun. The distances were ridiculous, and the slip-space mechanic was a bit underdeveloped, but hey, it's a still-in-progress. What do you expect?Then I went into the fighting mode, in which I was destroyed in seconds, and had a good laugh at how horrible I was at simulators, and confused as to how exactly the weapons functioned. Once they did fire at the enemies, however, their power was surprisingly underwhelming.I see a lot of promise in this recently-aquired game, though I've barely tapped into its' evidently deep wells of entertainment. I do reccomend this game as it will continue to develop, and the onward march of progress is a brilliant thing to behold.			"

Mining is a hassel and drones are still needing some work. But damn I love watching 500 attack drones swarm an enemy ship destroying it like bees defending the hive. I am still unsure of how to take over sectors and what my faction is actually called. At 10 hours I stopped caring for who is friend and who is foe. I live the Pirate path now destroying anything with an hp bar. Drones still do not return to my ship and they simply dissapear... very frustrating when I wish to do a Mass Warp Drive(MWD). Many abbriviations in the hanger are confusing and I have given up on trying to debriviate them. At 15 hours I still cant figure out most of the game play and there are these updates that I am not really seeing on my game. Certain Screen shots of the Shipyard and what not, that are very refined and look way easier to navigate do not seem available. Also options for subsystems like the new crew option and what not are eluding me. I still love the game and the idea for its future. I cant wait to see how everything pans out because I forsee me playing this game for a significant amount of time.			"

								Note that I barely have gameplay into the game. I originally got the game and spent hours building a ship, definitely going to be a simulation, you have to have housing for crew, where to eat, medic bay, cargo etc. If you build a ship wrong it will float im space with no acceleration or not be able to turn very much. When I first got the game it was an unlimited build, do whatever you want and it was pretty cool to build a monster ship to tear through space. However, last time I tried to play there was an update that gave you a credit limit so small you literally could not build a reasonably operable ship; Leaving out key parts such as the mess hall, medic bay and cargo etc. my updated ship still topped out at about 20 MPH and took literally about a minute and some to turn a 360 (buying only the cheapest parts necessary to fly and still ran out of credits). This has a lot of potential but hopefully that update was fixed. Or there was some feature option added I did not notice.			"

								Very cool concept.  Waiting for future updates to see how many different ships we can build right out of the gate.  Ship controls are kinda janky, and in my opinion, flies much too slow for a game with farming as an option, but still a work in progress, so not jumping to conclusions yet.  Seen some ships people have built and I'll probably play this game nonstop, once its fully completed.    The creation bay is perfect, but some additions to making pieces slightly less adjustable would be nice for a tighter fit.  Sometimes it looks right from one angle, but wrong from another.  Other than that, its way more fun than it should be to mess around with.			"

								Well you can't get any more sandbox than generated galaxies, ships built module-by-module and a variety of factions that differ from galaxy to galaxy. Kinetic Void has the potential to be a great game.It is still in development, however, and is lacking some important features. Right now, I'd still rather play X3... or even X Rebirth. But that is not to say that game has no future. How will it compare with Star Citizen? Well I think it might be able to top the single-player sandbox experience (given Star Citizen will be an instanced MMO), but the game feels a little arcady at present, and don't get me started on joystick support.I'd recomment this game merely for trying out the ship building and galaxy generation features, but I wouldn't call its gameplay enticing just yet. Give it a few.			"

This is a rubbish game and the devs should be ashamed to leave this as their ""release"". Makes you not want to back Early Access games because they are such a let down they take your money before the games released and then don't stand by their own selling point, It's no less then daylight robbery.

								This game is in Early Alpha stage. So I took that in consideration and looked in the long run. Not just as to what it offers at the moment. Kinetic Void is a new genre of Spaceship Simulator. Having it's roots from the old freelancer and other games from the genre, it bring us new aspects of the game. Creating your own ship.Kinetic void let the players create their own ships, the way they want. You are able to design and create the ships you want for any purpose that may suite you. Want a nice looking sleek ship? Go ahead and make one. Want a big though ship like the Galactica? Go Ahead. And when we talk about creating ship, the Devs have gone further then just looks. All of the ship needs, from the power to radars, to crew quarters are your to choice to decide where they go. And to protect these important systems is one of your goal. Having, technically, no limits, you can build any ship you would have though about. But creating ships is not the only aspect. If this is something that is not your taste, you can simply take some of the default ship, or why not download some designs from the community workshop? Having over  thousands of community created ships, there is a ship for everyone out there... If designing is not your taste. Kinetic void launches you in a Procedural Generation world where Factions of NPCs each struggling to survive and conquer the galaxy in their own own. You are sent in this sandbox word with one goal: Living your life how  you want it. You want to be a merchant, selling Goods around the universe? Go ahead. Want to be a smuggler and go past blockades? Want to just shoot at things and be a pirate? Or defend the innocent? All is yours to decide. Kinetic Void aims to  be one of the, if not the space sim with the most opened up world, with the most customized game possible and it does it in a way that makes  you wonder: Why no one though of this before? If you are a fan of any space ship simulator, Kinetic Void is a must. From it's amazing artwork, to the infinity of customization, to the hard work of the Team, there's absolutely no reason not to have this game.			"

								Great space sandbox game. The only complaint is that the controls take some serious getting used to and understanding how to build a ship is a little difficult. However, there are some great videos on youtube, so if you watch just half of one of those you should get a good enough of a grasp to be able to figure out the rest. So once you have the controls down its just a matter of your imagination seeing how all of the ships are cutom built with various modules that can be stacked or layered so the possibilites are rather endless. Also it has a Workshop so its going to be Mod friendly, and you can already post up your ships and download your favorites. So not only do you get to build your own ship, paint your own ship, and arm your own ship, you can then go fly and fight in your own ship. I see great things for this title.			"

												Anyone who's ever played early access games knows (or should) that this sort of thing is a possibility. Funding is a major problem with small developers, and many either don't plan well the proccess from start to finish ahead of time, things just don't go as expected, or they lose their minds and fall to stressors. Whatever the reason, we'll always end up with abandoned, or so called abandoned games. I've had it happen multiple times. I don't feel angry or regret it in the least. Because without the faith and support, we'd be missing some very nice games. You should wholly expect this when you see 'Early Access' and press that buy button.This particular game? If you're nosy about the awesome ship builder, and it goes on sale, sure, might be worth poking. Just don't expect a game. Else don't waste the money on what's essentially a set of legos that you can only share with screenshots. We can hope that the developers return to this game later with proper funding, but I wouldn't get my hopes up.			"

Early Access Review
								Kinetic Void - Great ideas and concept, yet extremely unfinished and Work in Progress.At this point in time KV is very much an early alpha - if it is even that. Consider waiting on a more finished version, unless you are a big fan of custom ship building and have little interest in actually using the ship in question.Even the ship building itself is at this time incomplete. There is only one type of weaponry and many other critical features are still missing. The rate of update/patch progress is extremely slow.From my point of view as a gamer, avoid KV for now, but keep an eye on it. IF, and I stress the word IF, all of the promised features are actually going to get implemented some time in the future, this could turn out to be a very cool space sim. However given the current rate of updates and the state of the game, I expect KV to be a project that will never end with a high likelihood of never getting to the finish line at all.			"

								Kinetic void currently is in Early Access stage, but already shaping up pretty well.Its a freelancer like sandbox game, where you able to build your own ship from different parts, attaching weapons to what ever piece you want, and filling your ship with different internal systems like: shields, reactors, armor, sensors and so on...Ship sizes can range from tiny fighters to a titan like dreadnoughts.The game have beautiful visuals, and as i already noticed, they tend to revisit some of the assets end improve them even more.Kinetic Void getting constant updates, and each getting it closer to completion.Developers are active in discussions and watching for good ideas and suggestions to shape the game.Considering this game is in Early Access stage, you might think that its better to wait a bit and probably will be right, but you definitely should check again later for a potential buy.For more information on the current state of the game you can watch this thread:http://steamcommunity.com/app/227160/discussions/0/828934089568066176/ "

Early Access Review
								Kinetic Void is a stellar example of what many space related games should be.  Mind you while in early access many things are bound to change.  This game has a ship design system very akin to that used in Galactic Civilizations 2 which should be counted as a good thing.  The amount of customization that is offered to players in the design of their ships is a welcome sight as it’s something I have seen lacking in several games with the same feature.  From building the fastest fighter to the most looming dreadnought the experience of testing out different parts and experimenting with style is a great joy.Players are allowed to name their galaxy and select how many sectors and factions exist within, giving them some level of control of the environment that they start off with.  There is plenty of room for expansion in this area of the game’s development as further options in creating the play environment would add to the overall experience.The combat system is decent but could use some work.  While offering a manual mode of firing your ships weapons, there is a means of auto fire via the lock on, and pressing the assigned weapons group number.  In this early build I recommend avoiding the use of the auto fire as my weapons seemed resistant to firing let alone hitting.  However due warning, there does not appear to be any form of aim assist for now, and larger ships will have issues contending with smaller vessels you just cannot seem to hit.  (I am sure that these features will be ironed out in the future)Other than that there really isn’t that much left to do within the game, yet currently you can see the foundations for what have the potential to be engaging and immersive systems.  I full heartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys building ships from the ground up and actually being able to use them, as well as to anyone who enjoys space simulation games.  For what this game could be twenty dollars is a fair investment into seeing the developers get the chance to finish this game.  Yet to be fair it should be mentioned that in its current state Kinetic Void is arguably worth its asking price, while I love building ships and taking them for a spin there is just not enough to do currently.

It now remains on Steam, incomplete. Perhaps the devs will return to it some day and realize the game's potential. Until this game sees life again, do not buy it. It is a waste of money.

Early Access Review
								Kinetic Void is a stellar example of what many space related games should be.  Mind you while in early access many things are bound to change.  This game has a ship design system very akin to that used in Galactic Civilizations 2 which should be counted as a good thing.  The amount of customization that is offered to players in the design of their ships is a welcome sight as it’s something I have seen lacking in several games with the same feature.  From building the fastest fighter to the most looming dreadnought the experience of testing out different parts and experimenting with style is a great joy.Players are allowed to name their galaxy and select how many sectors and factions exist within, giving them some level of control of the environment that they start off with.  There is plenty of room for expansion in this area of the game’s development as further options in creating the play environment would add to the overall experience.The combat system is decent but could use some work.  While offering a manual mode of firing your ships weapons, there is a means of auto fire via the lock on, and pressing the assigned weapons group number.  In this early build I recommend avoiding the use of the auto fire as my weapons seemed resistant to firing let alone hitting.  However due warning, there does not appear to be any form of aim assist for now, and larger ships will have issues contending with smaller vessels you just cannot seem to hit.  (I am sure that these features will be ironed out in the future)Other than that there really isn’t that much left to do within the game, yet currently you can see the foundations for what have the potential to be engaging and immersive systems.  I full heartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys building ships from the ground up and actually being able to use them, as well as to anyone who enjoys space simulation games.  For what this game could be twenty dollars is a fair investment into seeing the developers get the chance to finish this game.  Yet to be fair it should be mentioned that in its current state Kinetic Void is arguably worth its asking price, while I love building ships and taking them for a spin there is just not enough to do currently.  With the occasional frame rate issue and bugs, for those on a budget or those who are not willing to drop twenty dollars on an incomplete game I would still recommend getting this game but when it is on sale.  This way you can still support the game, get a great ship builder, and access to what has the potential to be a great game. "

								The game has a solid idea, but I can't recommend it. The ship building premise is cool, music is great, graphics look fine. But in the end, there just isn't a whole lot to do. Perhaps this is a symptom of randomly generated maps and factions, but once you make your ship it becomes a boring, although quite pretty, sandbox. I think dev recommended numbers of systems and factions would help let players know the optimal amounts of each to keep gameplay exciting.			"

								Not without merit, but thoroughly mediocre. The good:   The ship builder is the primary draw of this game- very versatile, can design whatever manner of ship you wish. The shipbuilder in Kinetic Void is more of a creative endeavour than anything else- unlike Kerbal Space Program, you do not need to worry about engineering constraints, efficiency, or performance very much. Perhaps that is appealing, perhaps not.The matter of taste:    Even in campaign mode, the game is very very sandboxy. You are given very little direction, just let out into the galaxy and accosted by radio about missions. Absolute freedom, but absolutely no story or direction.The ugly:   This game is utterly lacking in polish. Campaign mode opens up with an interminable tutorial, a series of pop-up text boxes listing what each button does- this is not a good way to present information. The interface looks awful, combat is unexciting. Space is ugly, a starless void with only waypoints as defining features. It is an exciting concept with utterly mediocre execution.TL:DR Buy this if you want to make model ships, or really like sandbox games			"

If you want a GOOD early access space sim, well Kerbal Space Program is the one to get. I'm glad to see the developer actually replying to these reviews but until such time as this game is playable in my eyes, i'm going to stick with other games. Please sort out the confusing gameplay. Ill check up on this in a few weeks or maybe a month and see how it goes then. But until then, i feel like i've just wasted my money on rubbish... :(			"

												Long, long way to go on this one. The premise is good and one day it may be realised...but not yet. One thing the developer oes do is listen to the community and continually works on the program. Unfortuantely, it should have stayed in the hangar another 6 months at least.EDIT (July) - With the upcoming July patch the game looks to becoming a game. Up until now there has been nothing enjoyable about KV, my opinion oly, but with this patch the sim/game might finally be closer to a completely playable package than previously. Looking forward to what comes next and as such have rated the game a ""tumbs up"" at this point.EDIT (March 2015) - A concept with much promise in the beginning yet left to fail and die as a ""game"". The 'Build' element was tragic and problematic from the beginning, but all there was to the title. Now, even it has been nerfed. This is NOT a ""game"" but a broken concept. Beware!			"

								The ship customization is certainly promising but at the stage of development I played it, I couldn't even figure out how to start a ship's engines without rifling through several videos on YouTube. And quite frankly Star Citizen has made millions of dollars simply by crowd funding, including $100 of my own at this point. So I don't see how this game will ever take off with such a titan on the horrizon of space simulators, especially when it seems this game wont be in a playable state anytime soon.Of course I own a copy of the game now, so whenever it is released I'll muck about with the game at that time and change this review accordingly.

								It's an early access game, therefore this review might change at a later date. If you have troubles with the ship designer, like I had, you fortunately can download awesome designs via Steam Workshop.The real issues start when you enter the game; Loading times are just bad and maneuvering the ship needs to be improved.

Im glad to say that this game did not disapoint me, I liked it alot so far and ancious about features that will be released in a future.

												tl;dr DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.If I could describe this game, I would. But it's pretty much unplayable, so I'm just going to describe something else.When my dog poops, she likes to turn around and instantly try to eat it. I don't know why, and I try to keep her from doing it. Regardless of whether or not she successfully eats her own poop, she wags her tail with such great enthusiasm and joy that she makes me question my own existence.Bought this a couple years ago when it was ""still in development"". They released zero updates since then, and decided to ""release it"". I'm pretty sure I'd have more fun eating my own poop than playing with this abandonware made by theiving developer. We should sue and get our money back directly.Do not buy this game. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.			"

												It is rare i write one of these, my time and words are not flung around lightly. This game is incredible fun even in its current state and i can only imagine what the future will hold. Currently it feels like a combination of Starmade and Eve. Starmade in how you build and manage your ships and Eve in how combat flows (But without insanely long buld times and skill trees ((yet???)) ). You can buid everything from tiny fighters to dreadnaughts the size of planets and beyond. Build you ship for looks or to focus your firepower tacticaly and as for guns....the new system gives you LOTS of options. The game has had it's bumps in the form of glitches but the creators actually listen to the community and talk with us to try to figure out whats going on so they can fix it. If i can hope for one thing to come it would be the ability to fly with friends.Update: The game now feels alive, so many ships flying about and reports coming in all the time keeping you up to date makes the game quite exciting now. All i can hope now flying about in space is that the developers really consider adding the ability of multiplayer. Flying about with friends or opening up a public server for massive clashes between player groups would be amazing. I can honestly see if this game gets multiplayer it becoming a cheaper and far easier alternative to EVE for people like me who refuse to pay monthly fees.			"

								Not sure what they are trying to achieve but the game just ""feels"" wrong, normally during a beta you can get an idea what the game is aiming for, i can't play it for long because the interface and controls are not intuitive.I'm also very concerned about the comment a developer made on a recent post “ it simply is complete when it is” suggesting that they have no plans or targets when developing the game which is asking for failure. I think badlands studios are way too small to deliver on this game at the scale they are proposing.			"

Early Access Review
								(The rating is only for the current version its at itself) 8/10, This game is absolutely fantastic in my eyes, its got alot of bugs and parts wrong with it which is VERY understandable as its in Early Development, a few problems i ran into so far, some Game related the other ME related, firstly the mirroring system still needs abit of work, if you click and object to place and have not placed it just yet, you can turn the mirroring tool on and it works perfectly, but if you place (at the part where you can use the Arrows or loops to move/rotate) If you were to mirror once you've placed, it would go really weird, it wouldnt be mirrored at all, a problem that is most likely me related is, Every time i get in to this one galaxy that i've had created, I'm only in a corvette because after finishing up on that ship i came to realise you can make a BIGGER ship by clicking the number box above the construction menu *Derp* I keep getting swarmed upon spawn and as a noobie, even after figuring out the controls it gets abit hard to fight back which means i obviously either need a BIGGER ship, BETTER ship or just get better at the game haha xD but Oh my god, the Construction mechanics on this game, by far some of the best i've ever seen, i've been looking around for a damn long time for a game where you can have a HUGE Wide Free range of customization to your very own ship and the fact that I heard that hopefully this game would be getting multiplayer somewhile after the base game is complete, I was swooning, showing off your amazingly or Crazily made ships to your friends and facing off in battle just makes me drool! I have so much high hopes for this game and i've only managed to find out when it was on sale, i would of gladly payed the full price! (If and when i had the money xD) but this is a game for all Space Adventurers with a craving of customizing your very own ship to as much detail as the game can generate just for you, a Game i very much look forward to being completed by the development team! (as a wannabe Developer myself) I look up to you people, and i know almost everyone else does, so keep up the good work and to you people reading this, Take a chance, Buy this game and Hopefully you wont be disappointed!!!! Back up these Gorgeous Developers!!! <3			"

								Amazing IdeaI like the idea of this game. Similar to KSP, but yet diffrent.In KV, the first thing i like is the ship class.I think it works off tonnage of the ship, from a fighter to battleship.Right now the game is very simple, but it is still early in development. Things to come from what I read from the DevelopersMissilesLasersCombat Aiand so on.The game already has a wide range of guns and cannons, making for a great mix and match.It has some missions, mostly from what i done, is rescue a allied ship under attack.I recommend this game, but please know its still early in development, so dont be too harsh on it.

								Please read before buying. This game is NO WHERE NEAR done. Early access here means early alpha. The builder is buggy to say the least, with alot of features missing and the once that are avalible are unoptimized. The flight in it self is .... horribly borring... I LOVE openworld spacegames, and that is what this is - except there is NOTHING to do other than fighting completely easyfrag opponents, OR suiciding vs. a much stronger fleet of ships. There are some early stages of ""missions"" here, which randomly pops up... They are mostly ""please same me"" - and they are totally uninspired. It might become something when it's done, but right now, get something else.			"

								this game is very cool and has lots of potential. when i first got it i played it for a little bit and then a few weeks later i got bored of it completely. there is so little stuff in this game to do once you build your♥♥♥♥♥♥.. it takes ages to get from point A to point B. the combat is ok..... if you can even get into a battle. there are so little enemies flying around and it takes forever to get to them or for them to come to you. and once you get to them they just fly off like your not there. i hope in the future they add more enemies or big fleets of ships for u to attack but thats it. its a good game if u just want to build a ship and float in space. for some reason, when ever i build a ship which takes about 30 mins and fly it in space the engines almost never work. and if they do the ship only goes 2miles per hour even when i make a fighter ship.this game has alot of potential but i cant recommend this until they make it a lot funner and add more stuff to it.

												UPDATE 11th of December 2014:So I gave it another try again. Hell how I regret it.Once the galaxy initialization process was at 100% the screen started to flicker.I waited. I waited longer. The game sent my Apple into limbo mode.I had to hard reset the machine. Hopefully I did not lose any data.BE CAUTIOUS!This is the lousiest piece of software I encountered for months, not to say years.I'm going to deinstall it. If there's a chance to wipe it off my library without erasing this review I'll do that, too. If I would be able to click two thumbs down, or even three, I would.Here's my initial comment from August:====For now this feels like pre-alpha software. Fiddling around with the editor is no fun for various reasons. (*)And the download took ages, too. If this would not be early access I'd now like to have my money back.(*)P.S.: I'm running the game in 1280x1024 on a low end Mac. There's an issue detecting clicks on at least all of the editor's top menu line icons: Even though you point at them your clicks don't get recognized properly, despite the icons getting highlighted. Instead there's only a small, let's say 4 pixel tall, detection area at lower icon end where clicks get recognized, even though the actual icons are much taller and clicking that low kinda feels like clicking off icon already.http://steamcommunity.com/app/227160/discussions/11/35220315921355473/ "

								Looks good in the future, especially the construction of ships, you can get really creative using countless modules / parts. There are tons of articles in workshop from a quite large community. Interactions with factions are rather simplistic and can interact with them very poorly, long way to go. They claim that new updates will focus on this area, as well as many others. Because it is still in alpha stage there are some bugs that madden, many things to polish, and it lacks some minimum written feedback. But even so you can still have a great time playing. I recommend it but watch the alpha state. Analyze whether it's worth.			"

								il be blunt. in its current state, this game is meh. only really the combat and the ship builing are near functional, although the ship buildign is pretty mutch done form what i understand. although i enjoy it very mutch, especialy scince the devs really interact with the community, (and i dont mean just through announcements, i mean they actualy comment on near everyones posts.) it is definitly not the best game in the world at this point.HOWEVER, the way the devs see this game in the future, in its completed state or near completed state, is amazing. from what i understand, is like the x series, with 2 big diffrences:1. completely procedural universes.this means that no two saves will be the same. evry time, you will start out with diffrent standigns among factions, in a diffrent star system, possibly under diffrent circumstances, etc. this will make the game, IMO, a completely diffrent expereince, especialy combined with the next and biggest thing on the list.2.BUILD YOUR OWN SHIPS!this is the complete awsoem part of this game. this is what sold it for me. you want to build a star destoyer to fly around in, go ahead! (watch out for lags though! (and the price to get that mutch material!)) enterprise? TIE fighter? BSG viper? a concept you jsut thought up of now? go ahead!in its current state, the shipyard is quite well flushed out. you can place most important modules and fill them with subsystems required for your ship to operate. you can even mount weaposn and use them! (WOHO! RAILGUNS!) unfortunatly, like any alpha game, it has its fair share of bugs, but those are fixed withign days of getting reported.jsut as a disclaimer, i am not a dev, nor am i in any sort of regular contact with them. as sutch, my above predictions are simply how i interpet announcements, state of the game, and other sutch publicly avalible plans. (an maybye a bit of what im hoping for it ;P)			"

								A game with lots of promise. Building your own space ships for hundreds of parts and sizes is very entertaining. While the game play itself is very complex, the fact that this is in development still makes up for that. Waiting for the offical release.			"

												It's not that this game is going to fail... it's just that there is better. Functionality is this game's biggest issue, it throws a lot at you without you having a clue what to do, there are no tutorials and the controls are awkward. If they added xbox controller support it could work though.And yes there are much better games out there such as Starmade and Space Engineers. Kinetic Void is closer to Starmade but is kinda similar to the X series as well. It's great that they intended on melding the two together but it does need a lot of work and a lot more ideas to pull it off. Unlike Space Engineers, you can only design the exterior of your ship so you can't see inside. On the other hand there are enemy AI to fight.Ultimately this game just makes you want to stop playing immediately once you have built your ship. It serves as a good distraction for about 5 minutes (add another 10 for learning how the game works through trial and error). I really do hope that the developers can one day make this game into something brilliant but at this point there is no point in purchasing unless you really want to contribute to the success of this game.If you're looking for something similar to the X games but want more focus on customization, this game might interest you. Otherwise i'd say avoid this.			"

												This is a very complicated game that needs a softer introduction for inexperienced players.Right now the ""tutorial"" presents a firehose of useful information without any experience using that information interleaved. That means it goes in one ear and out the other. Thus the ""tutorial"" system is extensive but is not actually suitable for true beginners. A better way to hook beginners would be to rapidly show them a quick-and-easy barely useful build without going into every detail of that build. Then get the player launched, guide them to another system/whatever and dock. Travelling to the other system should show some of the features/drawbacks of the build. Then enhance the craft. Launch. Script an easy Skirmish and guide them through it. Guide subsequent repairs. Return to dock. Buy replacements, upgrade, etc. That is a true tutorial -- what exists now is more akin to a one-time hovering tooltip.The graphics look good and the complexity revealed thus far hints at greatness. Unfortunately the time and rote memorization it takes to get initially acquainted with this game keeps me from truly playing it. I've never truly gotten out of the hangar before I had to quit and at that point there is nothing exciting about the game that makes me want to return to it any time soon. Hence I can't recommend it.			"

												I own this game for a really long time, and I have owned it before it even was on steam, and boy is it good. its not easy, its not like you're going to build a rocket and land on the moon int your first ten minutes. No it will take you hours on getting it right. Once you're on the moon, you need even more time to get to the next planet. This is not a bad thing, it actually gives you a challange, and it forces you to really thing about what you're doing and what you want to get done, and how you're going to do it not the fastest way, but the most efficent way. If you like space games, that give you challange, than buy the game. If like the more easy stuff don't buy it. Its looks simpel but its not.9/10 really good game, that will challange you, everytime.

								Basically a 3rd person space flight simulator, but with some very interesting twists. Most notabely the ability to design your own space ship, designs which NPC's are known to use as well, to keep the playing field balanced.Add to that relational status with numerous factions and reasonably large universe (can be set upon creating one) and you have yourself a great arena to test these designs in. Don't have an enemy? Create one by just randomly shooting ships that happen to pass by. You could always go mining or salvaging derelict craft for resources as well.Great graphics and awesome soundtrack, easy to learn controls, but sometimes not so clear on what, though optional, you mission objectives are make this a nice addition to any collection.There are some problems though, crashes, editor that has trouble doing certain things, but nothing really game breaking. And although I'm not much of a multiplayer gamer, I can see some real potential in that latest addition as well.Bare in mind though that this is still an project in development.			"

								I have not really spent alot of time on Kinetic Void, but the time i have spent was well worth it. It is one of my favourite games on my steam account, and every time a new patch comes out i play the game to see what has been added. I got the game roughly around 11 months ago, it was in very early build and just had a basic build mechanic and a an empty map, so i decided to wait a while. I came back when it was a at D10 and when i aw what had been improved i was amazed. The whole interface was so much better and the options had been implemented fully. I am still getting to grips with whats new as i have not played the earlier patches so i have not eased into the new mechnics, however the gane has come a long way from the start and i recommend it to anyone that thinks they would like this game.

												This game ran out of money and development has ceased to exist.  The game never got out of Alpha.  Just know that if you buy this game, it has no story, no AI, and no support.  It's essentially your custom ship flying around a galaxy map that is as pointless as this game is.The game had a lot of potential.  The ship designer is actually quite deep and the graphics were not all that bad.  The studio that made the game just had a bad economic model.  Hire programmers to develop a game with revenue from steam and kickstarter.  When money ran out, the programmers ran out too.  The end.			"

								  If you like spaceship building and designing ex. then Kinetic Void is perfect, build anything from a titan class Avatar from Eve online to a small Hornet fighter from Star Citizen or a Galaxy class from Startrek, think it then build it.  However the game crashes alot and having it single player can get repetitive being the only one besides NPCs to shoot at or interact with, still there are few games out there that offer this type of building creation so I'd like to see further development in the future.

								I have very much enjoyed my experience in Kinetic Void thus far.  Currently, it reminds me of much of Digital Anvil/Microsoft Studio's Freelancer - a game I VERY much enjoyed for providing a rich, detailed universe.  Freelancer also had a wide range of systems and paths that a player could take, and allowed for customizable ships.Kinetic Void ups the ship design aspect allowing for a completely customizable ship.  Runner, gunner, fighter, freighter...  armed to the teeth or built for speed - or ANYTHING in between.  Build a galaxy to play in.There's a lot to see and do within the game, and I think having access to the design creativity of the Steam-going public as well as a talented design team will provide an excellent experience.

Its a blast.			"

								I would recommend this game for most people, but not everyone. I have watched this game grow (and continue to do so) since July 2013 and am pleased by the progress that the developers have made so far, but there is still much work to be done in order to refine Kinetic Void. I would recommend this game to the following types of gamers:-Gamers who enjoy being creative in taking parts and building something of their own, but poses the patience to have to tweak, rework, or even recreate what they make after major patches come out. This game is still early access so it is understandable that these things happen and the patches generally make things easier.-People who enjoy a good RPG type simulation that takes place with ships, factions, and fleets, and can spend hours upon hours of trial and error to find out what works best in this game. -People who have ever played Battlestar Galactica Online: the game has a similar feeling to it and I feel that people who enjoyed that MMO would feel right at home with Kinetic Void outside of the ship creation menu-Peoplewho have played and enjoyed Kerbal Space Program: If you enjoyed the building mechanics in Kerbal, expect to enjoy Kinetic Void-People with a lot of patience in general who can wait for something to blossom to its true potential.I won’t lie, this game still has a lot of bugs (some are actually quite comical) but the Developers have done a good balance of both fixing these bugs as they come up and adding new content to the game, and I hope they continue to do so.

								Eh, I wouldn't recommend it. However I wouldn't tell anyone not to. I got it for free, right after Diaspora Shattered Armistice came out. I have checked up on the progress of the game and I am impressed! However I was thrown into an open world where I was overwhelmed and utterly confused. With the updates I could not find any way based off of previous knowledge of the game to actually create my own ship rather than be forced to have a preset one. Pros: 1. Total Sandbox 2. Never holds your hand Cons: 1. Complicated 2. Poor tutorial system			"

								I only have a couple of hours on this game so far, and those hours were purely from me painstakingly putting together my space ship.Having said that, I had an unbelievably good time doing so.  Even if the gameplay turns out to only be so-so, I'll still consider this money well spent.  The ship construction is incredibly good, both simple (though it takes some trial and error to figure out the eccentricities) and complex enough to satisfy... well... someone who has spent hours building a single ship.Something else that blew me away is the soundtrack!  I was nervous when the first track ended (mere minutes into my shipbuilding exploration!) that it would just repeat.  Nope!  Although tracks did repeat over my multi-hour session, there were enough and I enjoyed every single one so much that I was entertained the entire time.In sum, based on a couple of hours of gameplay; a fantastic ship builder and gorgeous soundtrack make me think this may join my list of all-time favorite games.

								I have not really spent alot of time on Kinetic Void, but the time i have spent was well worth it. It is one of my favourite games on my steam account, and every time a new patch comes out i play the game to see what has been added. I got the game roughly around 11 months ago, it was in very early build and just had a basic build mechanic and a an empty map, so i decided to wait a while. I came back when it was a at D10 and when i aw what had been improved i was amazed. The whole interface was so much better and the options had been implemented fully. I am still getting to grips with whats new as i have not played the earlier patches so i have not eased into the new mechnics, however the gane has come a long way from the start and i recommend it to anyone that thinks they would like this game.

								  If you like spaceship building and designing ex. then Kinetic Void is perfect, build anything from a titan class Avatar from Eve online to a small Hornet fighter from Star Citizen or a Galaxy class from Startrek, think it then build it.  However the game crashes alot and having it single player can get repetitive being the only one besides NPCs to shoot at or interact with, still there are few games out there that offer this type of building creation so I'd like to see further development in the future.

								Basically a 3rd person space flight simulator, but with some very interesting twists. Most notabely the ability to design your own space ship, designs which NPC's are known to use as well, to keep the playing field balanced.Add to that relational status with numerous factions and reasonably large universe (can be set upon creating one) and you have yourself a great arena to test these designs in. Don't have an enemy? Create one by just randomly shooting ships that happen to pass by. You could always go mining or salvaging derelict craft for resources as well.Great graphics and awesome soundtrack, easy to learn controls, but sometimes not so clear on what, though optional, you mission objectives are make this a nice addition to any collection.There are some problems though, crashes, editor that has trouble doing certain things, but nothing really game breaking. And although I'm not much of a multiplayer gamer, I can see some real potential in that latest addition as well.Bare in mind though that this is still an project in development.			"

								DON'T  BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!Even than the core idea seems interesting, the game is in so early development phase that there is no fun of any kind.The key feature of this game is the possibility of to design and to build your own customized ship from scratch.Other key feature is the randomization of galaxies but, it seems you have nothing to do with planets, there is no interaction.Engine is a hard CPU consuming and doesn't seem to be optimized.Lot of hours flying in a void space, where nothing happens.Lack of history board, or goals or missions.No user's manual. No key bindings. Weak user interface.Map does nothing for you. You never know where your ship is and, which is the distance to any potential target (except if they are in your range).Making it short, this 'game' needs a HUGE effort before it can be called a game.

												My first Early Access purchase. Not a good one.Bought it in early access when it first appeared on Steam since I thought it would be a great game when its complete. No idea why its out of its Alpha stage. At the current state it should still be in Alpha v0.5. Not even Beta.The idea was great, the game was okay-ish, but incomplete. In the early days they had some patches every now and then, and it seems like the game was on the right track. After a while the updates stopped, and i stopped hoping. At this point I had bought a few other EA games and learned a lesson on supporting EA games, that is only support ones that is trustworthy. The game lies forgotten in my Library, part of me hoping it will be complete and a part of me wishing i could just uninstall the darn thing so i can have my free space back for a better game.Just remembered i had this 'thing', uninstalled it and decided to give a belated review, so people would be informed and not buy this incomplete 'thing'.

												Interesting in the building part, funny to fly. As version 1 came out, many issues have been solved. A particular step forward has come with the integration of progressive missions. There are also the perks, which shape significantly the building part, creating some constraints. Maybe an improvement in the trading part can support more a fictious economy that almost breathes. Unfortunately the newtonian flight is not so well implemented, but there are a bunch of planets to explore.New updates, promised by the dev team (like the possibility to build your own colony on a planet or your personal space station), will increase the immersion in the gameIn substance I would give 7.0 over 10. In my opinion it is worth the price set.			"

If the idea of shp building is what appeals to you, try Kerbal Space Program, or Space Engineers.

Or even a bloody Executor-class Super Star Destroyer from Empire Strikes Back. That alone makes the game worth it, especially on sale. Weird how there aren't yet any decent USS Enterprises out.

								First of all, this review covers the game in its current state (D14.2)When I first started up the game all I got was audio na dno visuals...After looking through forums I found this was common for Macs and has been happening for quite a while...A major bug that should have been fixed ages ago. (the bug can be fixed by going into the display.cfg folder and changing the resolution to your monitor's native resolution and turning off AA)When I first started to design my ship I noticed the graphics could be improved a bit...But overall I enjoyed the ship creation part of the game!After you leave the hanger and launch into space,  the game is rather borring...A lot more could be added (I guess of course I haven't played this part of the game too much)Overall the game sounds fun and is a great idea, but it has a lot to be added and I personally would wait until a later date to buy this game.

								With the knowledge that it is an early access game, I am going to hold my tongue, or fingers a little. While I love space sims especially with that sandbox aspect I have a few complaints.I started a career mode game so I could try it out. I hadn't played the game in a few months and wanted to see what was new... Not much was for starters, but that is to be expected, a lot of Early Access games don't have a lot of updates (Except for something like Space Engineers ). I picked the random parts and started building my ship. After 1 and a half hours of fumbling around both because of player error, and because its a little weird... I press launch only to have to put in subsystems. (no I couldn't read the tutorial, the UI freaked out and overlapped the words) Once I figure (sortof) that out, I launch it... The game loads, and within 5 seconds.. not anymore or any less, I was destroyed... So I tried again... and again... Only to end with the same result. Then I go to the main menu, and decide to try and load a 65 part ship from my workshop... It loaded, and a warning popped up saying that I had to many parts and it might crash... 65 parts, and I hadn't even added the big shiny hanger doors and millions of hanger control modules I wanted to.. So I decided to launch it (and after some more subsystem fumbling) got it launched. I fought off the army outside, and then got up to my max speed of 57. In space. In a simulation game. Then I look at the directory, and find out if I press T and turn off a shield thing that stops me I will go faster... So a top speed of 83. Way to go for the USS Gweepo... A new speed Record. Then I point it towards the nearest planet hoping I will be able to use the new mining laser thing I put on to mine stuff off the planet. I watch as the numbers slowly decrease from 202.1 to 202 to 201.9 and so on. After seeing that I did the only sensible thing. Tried to warp towards the planet... Only to warp into it. Ten minutes later I spawn again and warp (correctly luckily) to the planet and try and land on it. Only to die again.Overall, I think this game CAN have potential if the devs iron out the bugs that it has. They (he\she\it, I dunno) seem to be very interested in te steam community so I give them points just for that.. Also, collision, and speed especially when it says that if you press the ""T"" key it activates Newtonian flight, should mean I have a fixed acceleration, up to an infinite speed. Not just a faster speed. Big ships need a boost, the AI needs help, Weapons need balancing, People need a little breathing room at spawn. Along with that comes the good stuff about it. You can (at the risk of crashing) build masive ships that destroy entire fleets (it was fun, until the game engine died) You can also build little fighters that reach 800 (units of speed and distance needed) While it may not be the #1 space sim on my wish list (Limit Theory is so awesome :3 ) It has a fighting chance. I can't wait to see what comes of it!			"

Allowing players to make vesels of any shape and size; players can make speedy cargo ships to extremely large and powerful ships bent on destroying their enemies. Never the less adventure always awaits you in ""Kinetic Void"", and there is still more to be added to the game in the near future. So when you make your space vesel and enter your galaxy try to ""live long and prosper"".			"

												The reports here are crazy. It seemed to me that the community got spoiled from DEV interaction that they expected the world. I haven't played this since it's pre beta phase but what i noticed is this. Not only can you make just about any ship you can imagine but any ship you make will be ingame flown by npc's. So what i did is subscribed to about 300+ player made ships and guess what... some how they are floating around in the game world. You can decide how large/ how many star systems/ factions are in your game at the start, as well as do missions for them. but this seems like if your dream is to not be limited by developer made ships you can fight any number of different space battles.I just wish they added the ability to buy/sell full ships in the store. That way someone who was playing the regular mode without infinite money and parts could save up enough to buy one of the ships on the steam work shop or even a generic basic ship without having to make every detail. That could make the economy more interesting as well.			"

								A freaking waste of 10 dollars.I may be an old time gamer, but I'm not THAT old. The controls are atrocious beyond belief. Controlling the ship is slow and cumbersome, controlling weapons is beyond unintuitive towards the outright moronic. I played nearly every space combat game known to man on the PC since Privateer. Even Eve online gives a better 'dogfight' feel than this game. The ship customization is pretty nice, I'll give it that, but that doesnt even come close to compensating the hideous combat. Locking, adding to target group, FIRE! I said FIRE!!!! Fire? Please FIRE already? Pretty please? Boom, I'm dead. Where is the dog fight? Where are the tactics? Where the hell is the weapons fire?

												I would definitely recommend Kinetic Void, however with a warning. The game as it is, is a lot of fun in my opinion. The ship building aspect is very entertaining and allows players to create whatever sort of ship they please, from small one-man fighters to giant hulking cruisers. Once out in space the game can get a little empty. There are missions to do which give you an immediate objective or you can go out and sort of do your own thing. There is mining for resources and diplomacy which allows you to go into a hostile system and hunt enemy ships for bounties. It can get a little old though. In my opinion, more diverse missions should be added as well as an option to select mission based on what kind of playstyle you have (maybe a mission interface at space stations?). This would allow players who want to play as a pirate to do raid missions, miners to do resource gathering, etc... I also think smaller stations should be implemented that do not have shipyards, but rather some sort of other funtions (ie. Smugglers' dens, military instalations, trade centers, etc?).  One more thing I would hope to see is more interaction with friendly faction ships, because as of now, friendlies just sort of drift around space and don't do much. I'd like to see something like, escort missions for friendly factions, or the possibility of hiring wingmen to fly around with you and assist in combat.I think the game is deifitely on the right track, it IS a fun game as is but it still needs some work, I hope a DEV gets the chance to read this review and think about the suggestions I've made. I think implementing  some of them would make the game feel fuller once the fun of ship building wears out or you've run out of ship ideas.			"

								Even for an early access game Kinetic Void offers solid game play with consitant updates by the developers. I've spent most of the time just building different ships in the game. The amount of detail allowed in customizing the ship can be staggering. You place hull parts and engines, fill those with subsystems that affect the ship in different ways. Currently you can take it out and fly around, shoot other ships or mine. There are also factions in game that you can do missions for that are generated for you as you are out in space. Newtonian physics as an option adds a great layer to the flight. Nothing better than strafing around at high speeds while in a dog fight. At this stage I can whole heartedly recommend this purchase, especially with devs that respond to the community.			"

								Kinetic Void is a game that allows you to build your own spacecraft from scratch. Very few games do that and less run this smooth. I use a some-what slow and old computer, but KV still runs. With the help of the steam workshop and community, you can upload your ships and load someone else's. You can also make several ships in one world and each world is randomly generated. I've played my fair share of EVE: Online and the knowledge of ships has only improved by playing this game. I look forward to tech trees and other advancements in the campaign. "

												The tutorial does a pretty bad job of explaining this complicated game. It's entirely text based, very dry, and doesn't even cover everything. I'm not trying to spend 45 minutes reading a text book to figure out how to build a ship... Kerbal Space Program and Space Engineers have fantastic and complicated build systems that take 1/4 of the time to learn that this game does.			"

												I suck at writing these... so here it goes.. 4/10. its not what i thought it would be and i did not expect it to be Star citizen, and im greatfull it did not turn out to be MWO and pay 10K just to see a bar move a pixle to the right... when i first got the game, my cute drones were horrible lil monsters that died...all the time (Curse you static objects!)...lasers hit 75k out while everything else was 50k or less... I could make my ship as big and long as i wanted untill it started to...curve? in the hanger? but....oh well... the game did what I wanted it to do. Keep me interested for so long then sit and see if that growth moves...(arms himself with a stick) Im only recomending this as a warning tho...this game is not for everyone and a lot of people hate it... so if you dont mind spending quite a bit of cash on something you might not like...read the comments first...good and bad...just so you know what your dealing with.

												Yes - the updates are slow. Yes - the dev team is small.No, this isn't a scam. I enjoy this game immensely just for the shipyard alone, and while the rest of the game (missions, general combat, etc...) are still young, and incomplete - the potential is there, but we, as gamers need to support it and the devs. If you ever enjoyed building your own ships in other games - or wanted too, KV is a GREAT GREAT way to spend hours and hours placing parts, balancing subsystems and then blasting other ships into pieces in sometimes, EPIC battles.No, you will not have a completed game if you buy this within the next few months; or even anytime this year - but it is getting there. Every month or so, a new update fixes bugs, adds features, and improves the general playability of the game. Just give it time, and it could be the next Minecraft. Years in alpha/beta; and then BAM it just gets glorious!			"

												This is the only game I have ever played that has a warp drive of sorts (except star trek online). You can build your own ships from scratch, and make truly any design you desire. NPCs will also have these ships available, meaning you can give them ships that equal your own in terms of power (so the game changes as you become more inventive). It is tricky to manage the subsystems along with the space of the ship, but once you know what you're doing everything should be fineThe worst thing about this game would have to be...the repetitiveness of placing weapons. You have to select your turret each time, and place it so it looks right. The mirroring isn't as finely tuned as the mirroring in Kerbal Space Program. Additionally, once the turret is down you must go into the weapons subsystem and select what each individual turret should be equiped with. Making large ships with lots of subsystems can get tedious and/or confusing, especially if you want everything to look even (which I do).A good point, the galactic relations allow you to make enemies and allies, which can be fun. Trading is something that I haven't yet figured out, which leads me to believe that it's poorly explained, however overall this is a fun game if you want to build your own ships and fight others in space.The main thing that would make this game a massive improvement would be multiplayer, better controls, better graphics, simpler mechanics to build ships, and getting rid of a few mission scripts that don't work.

								Ok, I have brought this on a whim awhile ago, one night I was going through games on steam I have bought but not played yet (ones I bought during a sale) I started building the ships and realized how in depth this game could become. This is early access and I was expecting an unfinished game, which it is... but the amount of potential this game has is crazy. That and the fact the developers pay attention to the people suggesting things on their message boards, really makes me happy I bought this now, because every update just makes this game better and i keep waiting for the new one to play it and see all the new things they put into the game. It does have bugs, but surprisingly nothing game breaking for this early in development. Right now i am writing this during a one day sale and suggest you buy it now, you wont regret it, unless this is not your type of game. If you like space games and building games, because the ship building mechanic is really fun by its self, it is probably something you are into.			"

								Kinetic Void is a very Early Alpha game. A few annoying bugs and glitches which hopefully get fixed sooner rather than later. The ship building is amazing. despite the bug and glitches. It is fantastic. Easily the best part of the game with me. Space flight is not too bad. I think as and when future updates come out then it will improve. Right now you just fly around shooting stuff, mining asteroids, selling the ores and building bigger better ships. Would like to see the planned economy come out. That should improve the gameplay a lot, Would also like to see the ability to start a factions, take space stations, mining stations, claim systems, Have NPC ships fly around the galaxy mining, and defending territory.Performance of the game is very good. On High end hardware the game runs over 110 FPS on maxmimum settings.  Graphics are very good in most places. In some places like the engine trails, they are pretty poor, at least to myself.Should you buy this game? In my opinion yes. While right now there are bugs and glitches, which is to be expected in an early alpha game, The future looks bright, with the developers looking well into the future with possible multiplayer and DLC content.

												On a mission to review every game in my library and I'm sad to say that I don't know what to say about this game.....It's shipbuilding is fun and complex, takes a bit of learning, but worth it.  The game itself is rather lacking though.  I feel that it would have benefited a LOT from multiplayer, if nothing else just to fly around and show off your awesome designs and see other player's awesome designs.   Maybe destroy other player's awesome designs.  Sadly, that never happened.To be fair, it's been a while since I've played this game and before writing this review I thought to myself ""Maybe I should go play it a bit"" ..... but I just couldn't bring myself to do it.  I think this is a good example of what you get when you say a game has ""potential,"" it's a risk you just have to take.			"

								This game shows great potential, who knows, it could become something great, the building mechanics are brilliant and the detail is real nice.but the D12 update made me lose some faith in this game, they completely messed it up, infact i will go to say they F@$!ed it up, hard, i have never seen such a mess up, the building menu is almost imposible to navigate, one bad move and you have to restart your entire ship, bug bugs and oh look, more BUGS, and heven forbid, i do not want to see anything passed the building menu. but not the entire update is a mess up, they now have paint styles and even if the menu for ship building is so far gone and messed up, it has this professional look to it and just screams Si:Fi, and the creativity is real good, i can spend hours on it and the part where you finaly fly your ship out of dock and test it, makes you feel like a boss, cause normal, if you are on creative, it owns (a good suggestion when its your first time, play on creative) and having hardpoints that are animmated, and watching them activate, makes me want to just imagin one day having multiplayer and jumping and and being the capital ship of a huge fleet in the middle of a war.even IF they messed up D12 and i losed some faith in this game, it could most likely recover, i just hope they recover before people lose hope for this game entirely,this game is great and i am willing to forgive the game and the devs for the D12 update, (only if they dont mess D13 up like they did with D12) but for a suggestion, wait a little while, or get this when its on sale, dont get it at full price right now, cause this game is sitting on the edge of a deep hole, and if the devs dont get it together and work on the menu, then this game could lose its fans, butanyway i give the game, 6.48/10 steam stamps (thats my rating system: steam stamps)Edit:Now, i would like to say, that, dear Devs, you made D13 one of the best updates.Building Is WAY more responsive plus, with all the new tools that i just found, they allow you to do New things, like the one tool (i forgot its name) allows the player to move one part into another, Allowing for some rather good Ships, myself included. so, i have gained all my hope back thanks to the devs fixing the things that where wrong in D12, and overhauling the entire game with D13, so, if you are reading this, and you have not bought the game, then i would call you crazy to click off the page and not buy it, but before you do buy it (unless you want to show your support) wait till muiltplayer come out.i re-rate this game 8.8/10 steam stamps (like i said before, i rating system)(additional: if you want me to rate a game, PM me)Edit #2 (Final)This game has gone to a whole new level of epic with D14.2 just because of the fact that now i can basicly hover right over a planet, go as about 30 meters from the ground without being blowen up, but there are somethings that could be impermented to make this game better, first off, landing gears, to land on a planet, second, just maybe, add someway of exploring a planet, with a vehicle or running around on the planets. there are alot of things that could be added, but those twos where the first things that came to mind.(if you want the review, read that part the other parts just not this edit)			"

								Not entirely a waste of money.Pros:  ~ More intricate ship building: Less blocky designs, more artistic designs seem to be possible with this game. ~ More customization ~ Factions present, hostile and non-hostile. ~ Pretty good graphics, and runs very well. (Have not tested FPS with large ship builds yet, will do later.) ~ Vast space system.Cons: ~ Guide and tutorial needs work. Bigger font size. Different color than the rest of the screen, make it big and bold etc, otherwise players are going to ignore it at first (like I did) and then kick themselves later for ignoring it. It took me 10 minutes to locate the information needed to simply apply Subsystems. If it takes that long for an average player to deduce that, interest will wane quickly.Y'know, honestly... I was going to write a negative review...but while writing this piece I've had a chance to reflect upon the game itself. Right now it IS indeed worth the price. $20.00 USD for a Beta isn't too bad at all, especially given the wealth of content in game, not to mention the very awesome ship builder thing (once you get the hang of it).For anyone thinking of buying this game.... be warned its not your garden variety Minecraft-esque Ship Building game. It takes some thought and a bit of patience to learn how to build a ship, how to make it fly etc etc. Its not easy, but it is rewarding once you've mastered how the game works.Right now I'd give the game a 6/10. Its above average, but I'd like to come back and review it when its out of Early-Access / Beta etc.			"

								Delivers on all the very worst tedium of a 4X game with almost none of the freedom or wonder.  The generated universes are very featureless and bland.  The combat is a snorefest.  A sad skeleton of a game built backwards from the ceiling down.  There's a neat ship creation system but with nothing compelling for you to do with the ships you create, it's utterly pointless.The only entertainment I can find anyone having with the game thus far is creating ships with the generator and then posting them on the workshop.  Consider the game LEGO with spaceship parts, then.I'm sure this review will get thumbs-downed like nuts from a bunch of apologists who would recommend the game to you on the basis of what it could be and not what it actually is.  Anyone who would recommend this game to their friends based on its current state is a poor friend to have.			"

I thought it was going to be the space sim for me, but I just haven't been able to like anything about it.That's not to say it's a bad game, it just isn't what I'd call a good game.I don't recommend it for those looking for a great space adventure. If you're looking for immersion, simulation, and a believable universe, you'd do a lot better to save up for Elite Dangerous, X:3 TC/AP, even X-Rebirth is a ton better than this.			"

								I really don't understand the design of this game. I liked the concept of it enough to buy it (obviously) but when I gave it a try found that it lacked well, a lot. Its not just the fact that this game is in alpha, its that it has an amazingly bad interface and control scheme, bad graphics and sound, and sub-zero immersion factor. Its like this is a ship building tool with a few minor non-ship building features. The ships look and fly like toys. There is no sense of flying a technical marvel of space travel, it just feels like you are taking your cardboard box out for a spin in the driveway. Let me put it this way, if Steam let me try this before buying, I would not have purchased it. My advise to the devs, play a few space games like Freespace, or EVE Online or Privateer or Indepence War or something then take a long hard look at Kinetic Void and make some much needed changes. Frankly I am shocked that anyone can even play this game is its current form. Kudos to you who find something of value in this game but it makes me wonder if any of you have played other space games.			"

Building the ships are overly complicated and unintuitive, and in so doing has resulted in a mass of ennui in the first introductions to the game.Perhaps it could be good in the future, but I think not, as they would have to re-think the entirety of the controls.

								Hi, I thought this game looked cool so I bought it. The initial part, the ship builder, was amazingly designed, only a tad confusing. After I created the ship, however, it spawned me in a galaxy. The flight controls were very confusing, and it would be nice to have a shipbuilding and flight tutorial added somewhere within the game to be easily accessed. Anyway, I pressed a wrong button and my ship exploded. Every time after that, my ship exploded. I have talked to the developer, Kaypix, and he says that all you have to do is create a new galaxy. Please don't get frustrated like I did. If you don't know what to do, Google will be your best friend, as well as amazing developers like Kaypix. I had a negative review, but I have changed my opinion. Buy this advanced game, but be sure you know exactly what you want when you get it, as the controls are confusing. Thanks again for your time.-MCMayhem			"

												EDIT: The game is out of Early Access now. For me, I encounter a game breaking graphical bug (Linux specific) that is unlikely to be fixed. Unfortunately, as I cannot play it, I cannot recommend the game any more. In addition, the gameplay has been changed from what I prefered, with Newtonian-ish physics only present when your shields are down, making it near useless for combat.This game allows the player to build their own ship of any size and design (unless if you don't pick creative mode, in which case you will have to earn your parts), fly it anywhere in a massive procedurally generated galaxy, and interact with other factions along the way. The ultimate in futuristic space simulation.This is an early access game and is currently in an early alpha, with frequent updates.			"

												Fun game, great developer.  I can't recommend the game in its current state unless you really want to fund development.Not gonna try to sell a game on hype and 'potential', especially after StarForge's debacle.  However, unlike CodeHatch, Badland Studios is very open, communicative, and engages with their community.So, yeah. It's not done yet, and won't be for a long while, but it's heading in a good direction, and it's already fun to just build the ships in the hangar.  Being able to take them out and fight with them is a bonus.  Worth twenty bucks? Not yet, but check back in a few months.Edit: Well, I was wrong!  It's 'done', but the developers are still planning to add more content.  Can't ask for much more than that, can ya?  Gonna be redoing my review later after I play it a bit.Edit 2: It's done..and..there's been no more content.  Not in any meaningful sense. I'm sad, but not disheartened.			"

												I bought this game when it launched. It has not improved since it was launched on Early Access, if anything the updates made the 'game' worse. What's now worse is that the game is abandonware and hasn't been updated once in fourteen months. The game is riddled with bugs and glitches. The only redeeming quality is the music, which was outsourced to Artem (I believe) and can be Googled without buying this trash. AVOID. Wish I could get my money back. Too many developers these days take your money promising the world, then after months of excuses, run off with your money. Steam won't refund anything past 14 days so you're screwed really. Out of a good number of EA titles I've bought, only one (Project Zomboid) has been a success and hasn't robbed me.			"

												I cannot recommend this game. They broke it. It used to be great - a sandbox experience where you could create any ship you wished, drag the file around in the directories, set up custom factions, create an entire universe with it's own factions, each with it's own style of ship (designed by you) and it's own alleigances / hostilities. Yeah. Not anymore. Now it's a dull, repetative, REALLY slow space game where by you need to mine ore, salvage ships and trade in a dull flying sim to make credits and upgrade your ship. Creating custom faction folders just causes a game crash now. The ship builder has a bunch of dumb restrictions that seriously limits the game's potential. Save your money. Man I wish I could go back to an older version.			"

												Fun game, great developer.  I can't recommend the game in its current state unless you really want to fund development.Not gonna try to sell a game on hype and 'potential', especially after StarForge's debacle.  However, unlike CodeHatch, Badland Studios is very open, communicative, and engages with their community.So, yeah. It's not done yet, and won't be for a long while, but it's heading in a good direction, and it's already fun to just build the ships in the hangar.  Being able to take them out and fight with them is a bonus.  Worth twenty bucks? Not yet, but check back in a few months.Edit: Well, I was wrong!  It's 'done', but the developers are still planning to add more content.  Can't ask for much more than that, can ya?  Gonna be redoing my review later after I play it a bit.Edit 2: It's done..and..there's been no more content.  Not in any meaningful sense. I'm sad, but not disheartened.			"

												EDIT: The game is out of Early Access now. For me, I encounter a game breaking graphical bug (Linux specific) that is unlikely to be fixed. Unfortunately, as I cannot play it, I cannot recommend the game any more. In addition, the gameplay has been changed from what I prefered, with Newtonian-ish physics only present when your shields are down, making it near useless for combat.This game allows the player to build their own ship of any size and design (unless if you don't pick creative mode, in which case you will have to earn your parts), fly it anywhere in a massive procedurally generated galaxy, and interact with other factions along the way. The ultimate in futuristic space simulation.This is an early access game and is currently in an early alpha, with frequent updates.			"

												This game is under developed, flawed, and broken. Frankly, it's gone from bad to worse through it's development. They throw out working systems in favor of new ones that introduce bugs that years later still arnt fixed, the UI makes no sense, the most interesting aspect, building is now horribly flawed and broken with menues that dont work properly, controls that dont always work or do what you tell them. Once you get out of the hangar and into the game, it dumps you into a universe that has no direction, with obscure and unintuitive controls. I would give this game a solid 3/10 for being a neat concept, but being executed horribly. Maybe another +1 for the decent soundtrack which is rather nice, but that's about all they did well.Going on their forums is little help too. The community is full of immaturity since any problem you bring up with is met with ""L2P noob"" and other snide comments when you bring up questions like ""Why did symetry stop working"" or ""What is that horrible constant scratching noise that wont go away?""There are far better sandbox space games out there, dont waste your time or money.

It and everything about it. From the bottom of my heart.I take it all back. The game is absolute and utter garbage. This isn't a RELEASED game, it's barely better than when it was in alpha. In fact, I think they entirely skipped beta. Thats like a crucial step to making a game, which would a category that this steamer doesn't quite fit it. Don't make the same mistake I did, and end up with the rotten end of the twinkie stinking up your Steam library. Don't buy this game.			"

												Let's compare my first review to that of my current, shall we? Just about 0% of this game's previous playerbase now still has anything positive to say about this game, so my voice is just a drop in the bucket... But I realized I needed to edit this.- - - - - (Old Review) - - - - -This game is amazing. Hands down the most fun in a space game I've had in a long time.What I like about it is the sheer massiveness of the things you can create and the massiveness of the galaxies you can explore.I've also found out that you can create your own factions, and if you wanted to, delete the starters and make all custom ones that have their own unique ships and all.If you're into space or large-scale wars or both, look into it. It won't disappoint.- - - - - (New Review) - - - - -The game has been dead since January 2015. The developer, ""Badlands Studios,"" is now some stupid game retail store somewhere in the US, owned by ""LumberingTroll"" (aka Sean Pollman) I suppose... But it's been almost a year since last I even looked at this game's page.Let's pray that these developers never live this embarrassment down - no group of coders who took advantage of hopeful fans so disgustingly should ever create games again. They released a massive list of planned features they intended to implement before suddenly (disregarding? ignoring? re-writing?) this list and passing their half-baked - no, too kind - utterly broken and pathetic project of a game as ""complete"" and then abandoning it after two or three further bug-fixing updates. ...which didn't even scratch the surface of what all was wrong with it. They took their money and split. Never in my life have I felt so horribly cheated, and it was only what, $20?I couldn't sit and let my once-positive review sit and be seen by other poor folk... So, here it is, over a year later. If anyone else ever sees this, you be sure and avoid any game that has Sean Pollman or ""LumberingTroll"" and friends listed as developers. You'll thank me later.

												This was way before, I forgot I even reviewed this, new review on bottom.==================================================================================FIRST REVIEW==================================================================================================I don't have a whole lot of time put in this game but I can say that the game is worth the money.<<WILL UPDATE AS GAME PROGRESSES!!>>Pros:--Customization: Create and command ships of your very making or download one of the many on the workshop and cause havoc. Also if you manipulate the game files you can have your created ships be specific to factions.--Open Ended: Do what you want, when you want. No forced actions.--Beautiful environment.--Balanced Ships (Can't create an ultimate fighter with world destroying guns)--ACTIVE DEV TEAM! these guys are great and are always making updates to the game. They will listen to the community.Cons:--Should've stayed in early access a little longer still a few bugs here and there, but then again what new release game nowadays doesn't?--Kinda empty: for a sci-fi space sim it seems kinda empty.--No tutorial.In all the game has potential to be the best space sim out there but yes it still has some stuff needed.=================================================================================NEW REVIEW=================================================================================================As you can see the game had potential, then the devs took the money and ran (and still has the game up on the market)DO NOT BUY - DEAD GAME			"

												After seeing some shocking posts in a few discussions, I've lost most of my faith that this game will become finished. Now granted I did have fun, but Lumber Troll decided to cut the project short due to ""The well running dry."" Now don't get me wrong, it would have beat most all of the other games had it not been abandoned. We've even had members who have tried to work on the game to finish it, again, because the community wanted to see this game flourish. He just didn't listen.In summary: Don't buy the game unless you want to be dissapointed maybe less than a day after you purchase it. "
