YouTube™ Video: 1Shot - 0rbitalis 

			Views: 702		

			Do you like ambient music, tense puzzles, and calculating complex stellar orbits without all that pesky math? Then you might be interested in checking out the Early Access of 0rbitalis.		

0rbitalis takes a deceptively simple game idea and creates something complex and fun out of it through a large variety of levels with various layers of difficulty.The basic concept of the game is gravity and taking it into account while clearing a number of different tasks depending on the level.  In the initial levels you are attempting to maintain your Probe's orbit around various celestial bodies, while later you have to hold the orbit in specific areas or crash your probe into specific targets. As you go through the game, it gets more difficult with different obstacles that will throw you for a loop.  A nice plus is that there is a leaderboard to compare your times to other plays to see what is possible and strive to do better.My minor complaints of the game would be a more apparent UI and a little more musical variety would be nice.Definitely worth checking out.

								Did you as a kid marvel at the science behind the NASA Voyager missions. The simple beauty of the slingshot physics as gravity affects the path of the craft. Well this game takes that concept and runs with it. This title is very much in the spirit of other planetary physics games. Think Bit Generations Orbital, but the core gameplay honed to a razors edge.The opening missions challenge you to keep your satellite in the planetary system for a set time. All with one click of the mouse. Before you launch your craft you are given initial visual flight paths guides. At the start, trial and error plays a part. But this won’t help as complexity of the systems ramps up. Like all great gameplay ideas, what at first seems a throwaway casual experience becomes oddly compelling and addictive. The daily challenge adds an extra layer of competition if you manage to battle through all the pre made content.Well worth a look.			"

												Funny or better to say mind blowing (like to kill me now !!! situation) game.Point is to set your ""satellite"" orbits to low orbite of combination of lvl planets and their circulars as longest as you can.Funny and hard game ... frustrating ... especially when you cannot set satellite to orbit for more then 4-8 seconds. Very frustrating ... but there is even greater price when you succeed and beat let say more then 5 minutes.Enjoy ... really worth any price (best in sale) .

0RBITALIS is a very interesting that game that recently came out from Early Access. It is a one-of-a-kind space/gravity physics simulation which I found really enjoyable.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:You have to launch a satellite in a way, that doesn't immediately result in a crash. Every level has a time limit specified and you must reach that time to progress into the next level. You have to deal with gravity fields, anti-gravity fields and bypassing asteroids. The point of the game is very simple to understand, but solving the actual levels can still be a hard challenge for your mind.Pros: The whole idea is pretty good. You have to launch a satellite into space, considering all of the gravity areas. You might know this concept from Angry Birds Space, if you ever played that game. This satellite must stay in the assigned area for a specified amount of time to successfully complete the level. If you manage to stay in the area for any time longer, your time is recorded and put onto the Leaderboards. This is where we get to the next good thing, integrated Steam Leaderboards. Your time is, as said before, recorded and compared to other players. Above all, you are also presented with a graph that indicates how good are you compared to other players. It looks very nice and really makes the player to try to beat his previous best. You can get a lot of gameplay hours from this game as there are a hundred levels, divided into sectors, and almost 40 achievements. You can also create your own levels with a pretty neat level editor. Those user-made levels can be later posted in the Workshop, where you can, of course, download other players' levels and have even more fun. The graphics are simple, minimalistic and very clear. They set up some kind of a mysterious environment that is, combined with an amazing soundtrack, exceptionally enjoyable. There are also Daily Levels for your daily dose of gaming. I have to say that I really like the way they set the price tag on this game. 7,99€/$9.99/£6.99 is really not high and you should really consider supporting the developer for such a low price.Cons: Despite low system requirements and minimalistic art style, this game surely needs a pretty strong computer. I had a few minor problems with lagging as the game seems to be pretty graphically intensive. I don't know what is up with that, but it needs some fixing. I looked really hard but I couldn't find an options menu. A game needs that, seriously. People with weaker computers cannot adapt their settings and therefore it's really hard for them to play a game. I don't like that you have to complete a level to unlock next one. If you get stuck on a level, you are pretty much done with the game until you figure it out. This is not the best thing if you're not in good relations with puzzle games.The final verdict:I really enjoyed the game, as the atmosphere it creates and the idea of the game itself are very well made and executed. You get plenty of levels, daily levels, Workshop integration so 0RBITALIS should get you busy for quite a few hours. Despite a few problems with the game's performance, the gameplay is enjoyable and keeps the player going on or beating his previous records.I certainly recommend this game if you are a fan of puzzle games. This is a very unique experience and you should try it as well, as the price is really not high.Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

												0rbitalis starts off with a simple goal: keep the probe from hitting a star or a planet for a set period of time. Generally, this can be achieved by finding just the right launch conditions to get the missile into a stable orbit. Soon after teaching that basic rule of thumb, it puts out levels in which stability is impossible and the surest course can be one with dangerous fly-bys and slingshot maneuvers, smashing into the surface of a star just moments after the timer runs down.That's just the first set of levels. Each set has only about five levels in it, with a progression that goes from introduction to experimentation to display of mastery quickly. Some levels can take a lot of time to complete as a result of their difficulty, but pacing is fast in terms of the number of conceptual tweaks. Long before a single idea feels played out, the next one is ushered in.These ideas can sound mundane, like having planets move along fixed paths, or they can sound fantastical, like anti-stars made of antimatter that produce antigravity fields. Either way, they bring something new to puzzle over. Other notable tweaks featured in certain level sets are pulsars whose gravitational pulls are variable over time, multiple star systems, and multiple rockets launching simultaneously from different locations.One major gameplay tweak comes with a total shift in goals. In certain levels there is a demarcated zone and the object is to spend a certain amount of time in the zone. Rather than surviving for as long as possible, the goal is to finish as quickly as possible. Instead of searching for a smooth orbit, the ideal solution often involves a high-power shot meant to break free and end once it has achieved its purpose.Personally, I prefer the more relaxed feel of the ""survive as long as possible"" levels. Since player interaction ends at the moment of the launch, there is a fair amount of downtime when the player isn't strictly doing anything other than watching the probe and predicting its path.That aspect in itself is almost a zen experience. With a mellow atmospheric music backing and a film grain filter over the simple geometric shapes, it's easy to be lulled into an almost catatonic state. I sat around just watching one orbit for about five minutes and it felt like it was only about thirty seconds.The visual effects work toward this as well. The subtle glow of space debris is calming, but the most striking effect is the trail following the probe. It fades slowly, so a long run over an interesting path creates an image reminiscent of those produced by a Spirograph. 0rbitalis has built-in screenshot functionality (in addition to Steam's), presumably because a good shot can result in some beautiful minimalist art.On the surface, 0rbitalis is a competent puzzle game with a simple central mechanic. It explores many facets with modifications and additions to that mechanic, and each new idea changes up gameplay enough that it never feels like its retreading ground. That's how one could describe 0rbitalis, but that doesn't really convey it.Finding the right groove and reaching a hypnotic state, that's 0rbitalis at its best. Fire a shot, have it smash into an asteroid. Fire another, have it slingshot off into deep space. Fire another, then contemplate the nature of the universe as it bends and loops around for minutes at a time, leaving behind a trail of where it has been.			"

												This game will appeal to a very specific set of individuals, it's fairly simplistic to play but requires alot of time and effort to actually master.   If you enjoy using your mind, and testing different paths of flight this game will for sure be for you.  In this game you make your own fun by manipulating your satilate's path, letting it use graivty from various objects to alter it's flight path.If what I said above doesn't appeal to you, then you'll likely not enjoy the game.  If you enjoy challanging puzzle games this one will be for you...			"

Create orbitsRating: 7/10Pretty relaxing puzzler where you have to create orbits and let your 'thing' fly. It plots an orbit which is constantly changed due to the objects in the neighbourhood. Your object has to survive for some 10-20 seconds. Sometimes difficult to set up the orbit but in the end pretty simple gameplay. And the satisfaction when you actually get it to run and it survives is just great. And keeps you on playing and playing...			"

								This is a fun pick up and play arcade game where the goal is to shoot a projectile/satellite/I don't know in a star system and try to make it stay intact long enough to finish the level.. It's a physics puzzle game about gravity. The gravity simulation works well and it has a very nice minimalistic presentation. In addition to simply solving the levels you can try for a high score by keeping your satellite in orbit for as long as possible. The dev plans to add a daily challenge which is always nice.. Will update review once out of Early Access, but if you enjoy these sorts of games don't worry about it being in Early Access.			"

Early Access Review
								The cunningly-titled 0RBITALIS (sure to be at the top of your games list) is an intriguing puzzle game for those who want something a little different.  Billed as a gravity simulator, the premise is to launch a satellite into orbit for long enough so you can reach the next level.  Sounds simple enough?  Using a mouse, you can select your speed and launch path and you have to use the gravitational pull of stars and other celestial bodies to extend your flight time without leaving the play area or colliding with something.Usefully, the mouse cursor position of your previous attempt is shown on-screen so you can tweak your next launch.  There are no lives, no time limit until launch so you can take your time: this is advisable.  One joy of this game is that it encourages experimentation - you can see the flight path up to a limited point.  There is no single solution, which encourages you to make several different attempts.  Your times are saved in a leaderboard and there are daily puzzles to play around with.Because of the terribly complicated calculations of gravitational gradients and the like, the programmer had to use Adobe AIR in order to set out to do what he has done, so the game can be quite processor intensive.  Fortunately, there are quite a few options to lose some of the background detail and this did the job just fine for my middle-of-the-range PC.It could well be time to introduce an addition to Newton's laws of motion: the classical mechanics of this game can be addictive but that is no 'constellation' if you crash and burn.  I speak with gravitas about this possibility.			"

								Very nice game! Pretty addictive, great physics, innovative challenges.Here are my suggestions:1. Keep the background music playing while orbiting. No music while watching the particle orbiting feels kind of empty. Maybe the music could also change depending on the action. Example: goes faster as the particle goes faster, or as the time passes; maybe with a special effect when a personal best is reached2. Put the timer counting somewhere on the screen right after firing. It will be much more thrilling to see the timer going while orbiting than waiting for the round to finish to know the end time3. If a level has been completed, that the player replays the level to try to have a better time and fails miserably (i.e. before the required time to pass is fulfilled), he shouldn't be treated with a round restart as if he had never passed the level (therefore not seeing the leaderboard and not having the option to go to the next level). He should be brought to the leaderboard so he can go to the next level if he wants as he may have failed now but he beat the level already and therefore has the right to go to the next level if he wants4. An outer ring that shows where is the limit before the particle is considered lost in space. It would be more thrilling to see the particle getting closer and closer of the ring limit, hoping another particle will have enough attraction to bring it back into the game5. Of course, achievements. When achievements are implemented, if a player by his previous games has fulfilled one, it should be granted immediately (example: make it #1 on a leaderboard)6. More levels with specific goals to accomplish, like the last levels where you have to touch lines to make the progress bar move in order to pass the level7. Nice to have, better graphics, especially better effects (flash, blur, etc.)			"

								There's some things in life that are evil. Gravity is one of those things. Yes, it keeps you from floating away, and it makes going to the bathroom a whole lot less disturbing, but I'm telling you - it's the force of the devil. Don't agree? Think about it - how many times have you dropped something on your foot, or fallen down stairs? Exactly! Without gravity, this would not happen!So, imagine my evil laugh when I discovered a game which would allow me to defeat gravity, and better - use it to fly my little spacetriangle further, and longer in the galaxy of 0RBITALIS.This game, is unique. And that gives it a great charm - added to by the really nice art style and audio.I like puzzle games, and I like space - this game has both things in abundance. The puzzle elements are challenging but not impossible, which is great. I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for something a bit different, yet strangely familiar in feel, or who like a challenge. Also, if like me you are suspicious of gravity, then it's a must play!			"

								A very nice and basic speed and directionality-based time-waster with a novel gravity slingshot component. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this title and how much I wanted to replay certain levels in order to get a better orbit.Its only drawback is the moments when the music (filled with very serviceable electronic tracks) ceases and you are met with the game's ""silence"" track. The more you listen to this silence, the more it becomes apparent that someone is breathing into the mic. This is someone who is trying very hard to hold his/her breath but cannot resist taking some deeper breaths now and then. This is creepy.			"

 Summary:  This key was obtained via evolve.pr for the purposes of reviewingAn interesting concept unfortunately ends up hitting and missing. Most of the problems I see revolve around the movement of the puzzle elements themselves, and no sense of finite control over it once you launch the satellite. It leads to a lot of try again gameplay that frankly is easier to launch 15 attempts and hope it works then one solid attempt that's thought out: there's just too much variance in the gravity to really pinpoint in it. The custom maps are cool, and I like how the score attack is designed, but in the end it just doesn't have the draw to really make the game stand out for the price that's being asked.If you are a patient gamer and really really want a game to challenge your timing skills, this may be for you, otherwise I can't recommend it.

			This first impressions was done with a key obtained from evolve.pr. It's an interesting game, but some of it's mechanics may be too problematic.		

 Lists: +: Interesting puzzle concept that's fun when you feel like you're in control of what you're doing and that your decisions make a direct impact to your success. Reasonable variation is present and new mechanics are introduced wisely.  Colors and visuals can work in a simplistic fashion. Cool that they have steam workshop integrated.-: Trial and Error gameplay becomes much more reasonable then thinking things out. This may be me missing something, or being impatient, I can understand where that may be my fault, but in my mind there's too many variables to get consistent results. The visuals can mess with you at times, at least on a blur side. Music really could have helped things, even with the vastness of space and all. Not for easily frustrated gamers.  "

								This is a great little game. The way the physics works out is really captivating and has you crossing your fingers that you have just enough velocity, or that the gravitational pull of certain objects is just strong enough. Plus, there are no right answers. Everything is moving. The puzzles aren't static. Timing is everything.The only things that drive me crazy in this current iteration are A) it runs in windowed mode, with the bottom part of the window cut off (if there are options somewhere to fix this, I can't see them), and B) on my laptop at least (haven't installed on my desktop) the menus are really sluggish. The gameplay itself is pretty smooth, oddly enough. Just the menus hold it back. Of course, this game my be at the limit of what my laptop can handle.All in all, though, a solid game.

												When you're playing around with gravity, something bad is bound to happen, like launching your satellite directly into a star or a planet. This is something the player will be running into a lot in the game 0RBITALIS, a satellite launching simulator with a retro puzzle style. Published by Mastertronic and developed by Alan Zucconi, the game simulates launching satellites into a successful orbit, or making them crash and burn quickly depending on how good you are at the game. Though to say that you're the one entirely in control would be incorrect for you are, in fact, not in complete control of your little probe's own destiny. One thing rules this game, and that is the rules of gravity.0RBITALIS is not completely scientifically accurate — just stating that at the very beginning of this review before the game is discussed any further. It doesn't diminish the fun that can be had from the game, however, because while it may not be a hundred percent accurate, it does provide an idea of what launching one of these things is like and how hard it is to keep it in orbit. For quite a long time we've been told by NASA how hard it is to launch something into space, how to make sure everything is working perfectly well and how gravity is playing a big role in all of that. Now you have a chance to experience their frustration on a smaller, more cost-efficient scale.The atmosphere in the game is immersive in its own way, and you will feel like you're in your own little world. It makes it seem like each little sector you go in is its own world and you're just visiting for a time. While it doesn't feel nearly as expansive as it could have, it's techno-ish music and minimalistic graphics will give you a sense that you're no longer on earth.There's no story. You're just a tiny red entity launching your probe or satellite, hoping that you will get it in orbit around planets, stars, and other space objects. A certain number of puzzles are based around trial and error, which may be a turn off for those who want a realistic space simulator. However, there are many rich complexities in this game that can be missed by the naked eye, which are not limited to the number of different ways you can get your little red triangle to orbit. There isn't only one solution to every problem that is presented, there are dozens of solutions that are hidden and you can find almost any of them by just testing the 0RBITALIS game mechanics. A lot of it is about testing your theories and seeing how they work out. The gameplay itself uses a small dotted red line coming out from your satellite that shows the path that the thing is going take. If a little red dot shows up, it shows that your little triangle will crash and you'll have to start the level over again. There are no lives in this and there is a helpful feature that shows where all of the other players have died giving you a chance to vaguely get the idea of where not to launch.

July 15, 20160rbitalis is simply not fun, as a physics game with inconsistent controls. I've given it time, and I even lucked into the top 10 on some leaderboards. The achievements show that most players give up within the first 5 levels, and some leaderboards and achievements expect you to leave the game AFK for hours. Look for the original version on Newgrounds if you want to try it first.I feel it is important to really explain what the problems are, and what the game does for players. 0rbitalis is a simple game about launching a shape around gravity wells. The store makes it sound like a puzzle game, as if you can control time and your ship. Nope, it's really as simple as finding an angular velocity, deciding when to click, and waiting for your shape to float around. You can't alter course after firing, you have no active abilities, you have no interaction. Gravity calculations shift every moment, so firing at the same target point can have different results if you are a millisecond off. The game boils down to a search for the sweet spot so your satellite survives long enough to proceed. Failure is irritating, but success means staring at the screen with no interaction until the goal is completed.The developer seems to be a nice person, and tried to help the community. He eventually deleted a bugged achievement instead of fixing it, but this game is designed in Adobe AIR so whatever. Still, developers know that idling-based tasks aren't fun, yet still use them. Getting an hour orbit wasn't really satisfying, mostly as it felt like sheer luck, and the orbit could've randomly collapsed at any moment. The leaderboards are somehow worse. Most levels rate the longest times highest, but climbing the leaderboards is just a combination of luck and leaving the game idle. The game will not run in the background, slower CPUs may actually run it slower than real time, and there is no fast-forward button or timer option. Yes, you'll be waiting on this game for a few hours if you are a completionist or leaderboard competitor. However, a few leaderboards seem to rank lowest-times at the top, often led by the developer with questionable times.Beyond the leaderboards, there is little depth. Levels drag on and quickly feel repetitive, but there are even more Challenge levels if you can't get enough waiting around. Challenge levels are simple to find on the map, but often require returning to the Star map between each level. If somehow you want even more, you can drag and drop some objects to make some basic levels for the Workshop. There IS a lot of content here, but it feels more like fetch quests than fun.Unfortunately, most of the issues are by design. The developer can't suddenly make the game more strategic, thoughtful, or interactive. Other design choices seem flawed, such as the heavy graphic settings slowing the game. Graphical settings are changed by toggling between 4 details with the Q key. Despite simple graphics, all the extra particles and blur effects slow the game down, even on minimum. Gravity calculations vary with framerate, and different computers will calculate differently according to the developer. Maybe the physics calculations could be improved and sped up if all the extra graphical details could be disabled. I'd prefer to have a fast-forward option than pointless rotating lines and frame drops.I can understand some of the positive reviews, as the developer seems nice and the game worked in Early Access. It still feels incomplete and shallow. It could almost be redeemed as an educational tool on physics, but the barebones objectives and inconsistent physics will teach nothing. As just entertainment, the frustrating gameplay prevents anything from shining. I got the game from a Humble bundle with intent to play it. I cannot really recommend the game, even on sale. I can respect the developer, but most of my gameplay has been waiting around and wishing for luck. I wish I could enjoy it instead.			"

												A great concept and the puzzles are indeed interesting to play at first.However the game can become rather difficult as you try to find that sweet spot to pass the level.You may end up repaeting the same level dozens of times moving your mouse curser less than a cm hoping you pass.I would not mind this as it does add an aspect of challenge to the game, unfortunatley there is no desire when you finish playing, to go back to it, because you know its tedious work and not all that fullfilling when you finally get through.I even came 9th on the leaderboards once, and still I wasnt too bothered about it.

								This is definitely just a trial and error simulator.  It is very difficult to find a strategy that will work, and you're not ""solving a puzzle"" with each level.  Are you going to get lucky so that your object stays within the prescribed area?  It may or may not have a center of gravity or be centered around the center of gravity.  So yes, this is luck.One additional gripe I have is about the spelling of the name.  The zero at front guarantees that they are listed first alphabetically in almost all lists.  It does, however, make the game very difficult to find in your games list.  Zerorbitalis.			"

								This game is a nice time-killer, but it doesn't represent actual orbital mechanics I expected from it. You speed up passing a ""planet"" even if you go against it's motion, which is totally wrong. My KSP experiense contradicts this game's physics.If you played KSP/Orbiter, want to learn/know/practice orbital mechanics - don't play it.If you haven't or want a nice time-killer: go for it.P.S. What was the tool the game was written with? It's giving me 5 fps on a PC that runs Battlefield 3 on max settings with 60fps. Had to use low settings here.			"

								Spirograph, The Game!  Seriously though, it's a fairly intriguing game.  The entirety of the game revolves (hah, wasn't intending that) around using gravity to complete an objective depending on the stage.  These objectives vary from just staying alive and not crashing for a specific period of time, to flying through specific points on the map (using the gravity of static or moving bodies), to maintaining proximity to specific gravitational bodies.  The UI of the main menu leaves a bit to be desired, favoring artistic beauty over simplicity/clarity; from what I can infer, the idea is a pseudo-3D look, but in reality it all just looks blurry and out-of-focus.  However, the actual gameplay doesn't suffer from these problems.  Another drawback of the game is that it is very CPU intensive.  I currently have a Intel G3258 CPU in my computer that I've over-clocked, and any time I even attempt to go over minimum quality settings, my computer starts to noticably chug.  At the end of the day though, I had a quite enjoyable time.  The mechanics are SPOT-ON and, although it seems the dev missed the mark when it came to the menus, the artistry of the actual gameplay is quite mezmerising at times.  As long as you're not expecting anything genre-defining or ground-breaking (as most levels are pretty much variations-on-a-theme), you should have a pretty good time!			"

								This game is beautiful. Elegant. I find it utterly engaging.It is simple, but not easy.The task is to launch a satellite into orbital systems with increasingly complex gravitation attributes.The goal is to keep your satellite orbiting in the system for as long as possible.Using the mouse, you control direction and amplitude of your launch, with the early trajectory displayed.Once you launch, sit back and watch the results.Why would I be recommending such a zen-like physics game?There are global leader-boards and you WILL obsess about climbing them.

												A simple yet extremely entertaining game that makes you sit on the edge of your seat the whole way through. This game challenges your timing skills and knowledge of physics, where if you are correct in your estimations, you will have a successful level and finish with happiness, or fail over and over and over again. This is a game where patience is key and if you do not handle well with losing time and time again, it is best you look for a new game to play. It is basic in aspect, yet as soon as you delve into it, it becomes much more complex than that one thing you learned in Maths year 2. A good game to kill time with or to show off to your friends how skilled you truly are, I give this game a 9.9/10, and the only reason I give it that is due to it being a small bit of lag after each round.

PROSCONSMesmerising.Instable after too many orbits when showing full satellite pathAbility to lessen how much of the travelled path is shown MathThis is another of those games that kind of snuck up on me. I decided to play it for some trading cards, and my mind was instantly overwhelmed from the orbits. If I had to do something I didn't want to do... like WORK?! Yeah... I'm going to load it up in the morning make a stable-ish orbit, then go to work, and hope to see it still going when I get back. It's kind of exciting for being such a low involvement game. The graphics are very basic. The controls are everything they need to be. I beat it pretty quickly, but the replay value is definitely there.

												Clever top-down gravity-based physics puzzler where the goal is to establish an orbit around a set of various-sized celestial bodies that lasts as long as possible.   You are shown the initial part of the trajectory and have to mouse your mouse to aim your satellite and adjust initial velocity to try and get your satellite to orbit one or more of the bodies in a semi-stable series of orbital loops.  These orbits are chaotic in nature, by which I mean, the slightest change in the initial trajectory can lead to dramatically different outcomes.  Hence, this puzzler is partially based on trying to figure out what might be the best initial trajectory and the sort of orbits that can potentially be established and part just trial and error with a fair amount of luck thrown in for good measure.  Definitely not worth the full price of $10, which is definitely overpriced for this type of game.  However, getting it on sale for a buck or two or as part of a bundle, I could easily recommend for those that want to play a light hearted puzzler where you can eventually get lucky, and hence, never really get stuck.

												Note: I'm currently going through my Steam library and playing all the games I've never played. This is the first of many quick reviews. I can't believe I didn't try this out sooner. Sometimes these indie games can either be too dumbed down or too smart for their audience. I believe this one strikes a great balance. Fire projectiles from a moving body and keep in in the play field for the time limit while not running into anything by using the gravity of other moving bodies. Simple to grasp, difficult to master. Graphics and music is minimal but goes well with the space-ish setting. Seriously kicking myself for not having installed this sooner. This will stay in the permanent rotation.			"

								This isn't really a ""puzzle"" game with any discernible mechanics. Most of the gameplay consists of trial and error.I only played the first handful of levels (which should have been showing me the core game mechanics) but all I experienced was randomly clicking on the screen once, waiting, and seeing what happens...usually resulting in repetition. Since you have to keep your ship ""in orbit"" for a certain amount of time, the amount of waiting time after each click while watching the resulting animation is far too long. The game has a lot in common with the annoying component of Space Badgers. For a game that is all about gravity, we aren't even given the most basic information (such as the relative masses of the various planets/stars or their relative distances from one another). The concept is solid, but the game does nothing to actually follow up on it other than a mere visual presentation (which is apparently not graphically optimized, but I have a brand new system so I couldn't tell). A puzzle game implies some form of logical structure or thinking involved. Perhaps it is the games presentation that is lacking and I simply missed it, but as another reviewer said, this felt like ""a glorified screen saver.""Pass.			"

								0rbitalis is a very solid game, even if it's still in Early Access. This review was written during stage Alpha 4.No story in this game (as yet), it's purely a puzzle game.There are a good variety of different puzzle types in this game, and it is very good at preventing itself from going stale. Fairly good difficulty progression, but it would be nice to have more levels.You need a mouse, or even just a trackpad to play this game.The menus seem a little slow, but aside from that the overall graphical feel of the game is very good. Simple, and to the point. There is little need for sound in this game, but the minimal amount of sound that is used works very well.There are leaderboards & more community functions being integrated into the game, so you can rejoice at the jammy people with insanely better scores than yourself.Even though this is an EA game, there are no game-ruining bugs that I could find, which means this game definitely shows promise. It would be very good if it integrated the workshop for custom levels. This game is one to watch. "

								Incredibly fun to play and quite tricky as you begin to progress through the levels. I love the relatively simplistic idea behind the game but tracking the movements of the space bound bodies and trying to fire off on the perfect trajectory is really hard on some of the levels.Sometimes you think you've just managed it and as the time counts down you get dragged in to a nearby planet. Just another few tries.. then ten minutes later you've managed it. Definitely a game I'll be playing for a while and I love how it brings up the leaderboard scores instantly upon level completion too, so even if you've completed the level you're enticed to retry and last longer.

								I wouldn't pay money for it, but as part of the Humble Bundle it's worth playing. The objective depends on the level, but for example it's to pick a trajectory where you avoid crashing into anything for ~15 seconds. The problem is, most of the time things move including your starting position. Since the slightest variation can have a huge affect on your trajectory, even with excellent timing there's a lot of luck.+ Fun+ Some good puzzles- Lots of luck- Cumbersome interface, no fullscreen- Some levels are impossible "

												""The Gamer Gourment""So I choose this game to be my second review on steam during my 'come back tour""First off this game is not for those that have little or no patience. Often I found myself going COME ON, at the mere micro second of difference between finishing a level and failing. This to me added a level of 'I can do this"" with each level I came across. The graphics, forgettable. The sound, nearly none existant. But this isn't one of those type of games. Its a pure puzzle game based on the common physics of anything you may have learned from watching star trek.Down to the nitty gritty.You guide a..object that uses objects I can assume in space to make it's orbit unblocked for whatever time limit it gives you. You do this by launching whatever this device is (a square) into the level using whateve robjects available to effect gravity and therefore, hopefully, have a good alignment to prevent collisions with the previous mentioned random object/s.Thats really it. And yet it is addictively fun! Found myself flustered yet determined with this game to progress with each level.The graphics simple, what u need to get what u want done. But for some reaosn it is a graphics hog, even with my power house I found it hanging.....Sound forgettable....it has sound?Replaybility...well..it's a puzzle game, so thats determined on your own desire to finish each level....but once finished I can say most likely little desire to come backConcept...nice niche game fun to pick up and put down....Fun...absolutely.....simple yet elegant....So overall...worth your time..it's not a monumental game at all....but in the field of puzzle games its original, inventive, and addictive....if u like puzzle games with a new approach check it out.

								0rbitalis is a really cool and neat game, with a very basic idea/mechanic, but very well done. It is an orbital mechanic puzzle game, where you launch your mass around the greater mass, with the slight chance of it hitting a smaller mass, or being slingshot around by it. The objective per level is to figure out where to launch your mass, and have it succesfully orbit around  for at least 5 or so seconds. So the levels can go by quick if you figure it out immediately, but if not, there will be a lot of trial and error, but it can be very forgiving though. In all, for $6.99 (i had a coupon that made it $1.75) it is definately worth it, and definately worth a try.			"

								The first few levels teach you a bit about gravity without a single word. The next few show you how gravity would've worked if it was broken. I might not call it a true puzzle game since you need pure luck to get to the top of the scoreboard, but it's pretty to look at and easy to play. If it's on discount, get it. You'll probably like it if you don't expect to get past each level on your first try.			"

Early Access Review
								A simple game, perhaps better suited for a phone than a desktop. The game consists of small levels containing various types of gravity-altering bodies, and the goal of each level is to launch your little ball of light and have it get somewhere or do something within a certain amount of time (or for as long as possible in some cases). The levels are grouped up in to bunches of 4-5, and each group of levels shares similar mechanics and goals, and entering a new group of levels will introduce you to new mechanics and often change the win-condition of the levels.This brings me to my biggest negative: how to win a level is never explained beforehand. And some of the win-conditions are completely opposite (do X for as long as possible vs do X as quickly as possible). Some you can fogure out after of couple failed attempts, but others might make you sit there for 5 minutes as your ball of light orbits around making you think like you're racking up a super high score, only to have it crash and reveal that you were just wasting your time.There is some skill to the game. I've gotten better at predicting orbits as I've gone through the levels. However, once the levels get to a certain complexity, you really can't predict or plan out your path with any degree of precision or certainty, and it just becomes a crapshoot. A typical later level looks like this: launch your ball in a direction that looks good, watch it orbit for 10 seconds, going in wildly unpredictable directions (in theory it's completely predictable, but when you have 5+ bodies moving around and pulling your ball in different directions at different rates it's next to impossible to do), restart the level, slightly modify your shot, and do it all again. And depending completely on luck, you might beat that level in 5 tries or 50.The scoreboard is a cool feature. It's nice to randomly get an awesome score on a level and see yourself near the top. However, looking at some of the scores, it's hard to argue that it's anything but random. You can't tell me something predicted their 2 minute orbital path before launching.Overall, this is the type of game I play a level or two of for 10 minutes before going to bed. I would never sit down and make a gaming session of this game, nor do I have any incentive to replay levels over and over to go up on the scoreboard. But as a relaxing, wind-down game, it serves its purpose well. I would say this game was definitely worth the ~$1 I paid for it, and I could see myself getting a couple more hours of play out of it.			"

								The game features fantastic and innovative use of 'movement' and motion, seeing you pilot a spaceship around a solar system. However, once the craft is launched, it cannot be controlled, with the gravitational pull of planets and stars taking effect. The minimalist aesthetic and great soundtrack all draw the focus onto the gameplay itself, also being of a mimimalistic approach. It's simple and yet offers a wonderfully enjoyable challege.Despite being Easy Access, the game runs incredibly smoothly, but would appear to have yet to have it's level set complete. It should also be noted that despite offering windowed and fullscreen options, the gamespace is set within a 1:1 aspect ratio, so the full screen view is pillarboxed. The game could well be updated to include a 16:9 ratio in the future however. The addition of Steam Workshop intergration would also seem to be likely in future versions as well.			"

												0rbitalis is a simple little orbital mechanics puzzle game. You shoot a little ball and it's got to stay within the play area for 10 seconds without getting flung into space, or crashing in to an orbital body.It's not a unique concept, but it's one that's unfortunately not executed well. The biggest issue is that, in addition to the various planets and stars moving, often your launch point is moving too. Many levels require fairly precise timing and aim, and because of the variety of things moving around, you'll normally spend most of a puzzle that you've essentially soved firing off into space, or into planets because you haven't gotten lucky enough to fire at exactly the right time at exactly the right speed. It makes the whole thing feel more like an exercise in luck rather than any actual problem solving.There are better, free-er games out there on the web. I'd give this one a pass.			"

More things to orbit around and of course crash into appear as you progress to new systems. Eventually the game puts limits on where you need to orbit for a certain amount of time as well. making me even more crazy.Give it a shot if you like simulated puzzle with gravity.			"

								This game has a really cool mechanic, but my issues are with the layout. My mouse seems very laggy when running the game. While the main menu looks kind of cool at first, it in turn looks incredibly blurry. They show a couple hot keys for different commands very quickly, but I could not read fast enough on my first few views to see them. The menu navigation also seems sluggish and non-responsive. Once I was in game, I was able to understand the concept pretty quickly, but felt that whatever I'm casting into orbit shouldn't be effected by gravity right away. This made it difficult to choose my starting route as I felt for a puzzlish-style game, I should be able to consider my actions before commencing them.			"

												This game is a mixed bag that feel is going to be very well received by a small audience, and not so well received by the majority of players. I liked it more than I thought, but I will probably never play it again after this review so I have to not recommend it for most people. Some could find enjoyment here, so here's the good, the bad, and the ugly (also bad):The good: A unique premise for a puzzle game. The music fits the game well. Some of the music slightly reminds me of music from the 2002 film, Solaris. Simple control scheme that doesn't get in the way of gameplay. The ability to see where other players launched, but that is also a double-edged sword I feeel (see below).The bad and the ugly: It's basically a 'guess where to click to make you orbit the longest' game. The precision of your launces is pretty much down to twitch gaming (click at the exact right moment in time and space). It's very difficult to intuit what a good launch point is. Maybe the game just has one of those learning curves, but even after an hour of play, I felt like I was just mostly randomly guessing. Seeing other players launch positions is helpful, but it feels like a crutch to make up for the ability as a player to 1) really get an intuitive feel for good launch positions, and 2) be able to precisely determine those launch positions. The graphics are nothing special. We're talking about the simplest of geometric shapes and vector graphics. Sometimes the speed of your launched satellite is so fast, you can see the line segments of your orbit. You can see the individual line segments rather than a smooth curve. Seems very sloppy. The game gets repetitious pretty quickly. While some new gameplay elements are added (like a 'planet' that repulses instead of pulls in like normal gravity), it just doesn't change up the ""guess where to click"" mechanic of the game very much.Having said that, I still found enjoyment in this game far longer than I though I would have. I'm satisfied with the game overall, but I got it heavily discounted while on sale. As of this review, the game is sitting with a $10 USD price tag, and I find that horribly overpriced. I can't see paying more than $3 USD (or your regional equivalent) for a game like this. There just isn't enough substance here to justify that price in my opinion.Overall: 6/10.Get it if it's on sale and you like orbital simulations, spacey ambient music, and puzzle games. If not, you'll probably want to pass. "

												As a space enthusiast, I was very excited to play a gravity/orbit based puzzler. Unfortunately, this game does not provide a worthwhile experience. First of all, the game is locked at 30 FPS and does not have a settings menu. You can only swap between preset graphical options with the “q” key. And it doesn’t tell you what settings level you are on- the difference is so minute it’s hard to tell anyways. The real killer is the actual way the game is displayed- the area the gameplay is displayed isn’t in a 16:9 or even 4:3 aspect ratio. While this makes sense in terms of level design, the developers didn’t even bother to put the scoreboard or any additional information on either side of the square game window (this is in full screen). The color scheme is bland and the edges of the playable screen are grey and blurry. It isn’t a pretty game by any means. In terms of gameplay, 0RBITALIS is decently entertaining at first, but it gets stale when you have to start guessing and testing for several minutes just to get your orbits right. You’d figure on a desktop game will very little graphical demand they would at least have an option to show a much longer projected path, but you are left with one that approximates around 2-3 seconds into the future. Once you launch the projectile, it is at the mercy of the not-impressive gravity simulation.I really hoped that I could enjoy this game. But I can't reccomend it. Did I mention it runs on Flash?			"

Be sure you exceed the minimum system requirements: my system is quite old, and although I (barely) meet them, the game is-- even on the lowest quality settings-- unenjoyable due to the low framerate.  Quite a disappointment, since the look and the concept (and all the favorable reviews) had me really looking forward to it.

								More luck than puzzle and ""gravity simulator"" is far from accurate. How is the gravity inacurrate?- orbits decay automatically, as if you are experiencing atmospheric drag which doesn't fit the story- celestial bodies pull you to WHERE THEY WILL BE. It should be pulling you always to its current position- there is no aerobraking when you are deep in a planet's atmosphere. you either hit the planet or accelerate around it- super high gravitational constantIf this game had accurate gravity it would be far too easy. Try NOT landing on a planet in KSP. Yeahhh that's how most of my KSP missions end up.This game is a casual time waster for about 30-60mins. Probably better off as a phone app.			"

								This is barely a game. Every level I have seen thus far is literally positioning the mouse somewhere on the screen, clicking a single time, and waiting to see what happens. The word 'puzzle' typically implies some logical thought must be applied to a situation. The mechanics of this game allow you to position your satellite such that it wont die within 1 second of launching, beyond that is fundamentally boils down to luck and/or your willingness to stare at a glorified screen saver long enough to find the right place to click your mouse at the start of the level.Buyer beware.

								This is a review of Orbitalis.Gameplay: 3/10The gameplay consists of piloting a shape around other shapes, taking gravity into account as the shapes move around each other. The objective is to not smash your shape into any other shapes. You choose a course, which you cannot change, and your shape follows this course.I will say this: it is consistent and accurate. If you get the timing and the course right, you will fly your little shape around for a good amount of time. However, what I've noticed most about this game is how failure feels a lot like FAILURE, and it happens over and over again. It is a puzzle game, but an unforgiving one, and completing levels DID NOT give me any sort of rush. In fact, all I felt was relief that I was done with a level.Graphics: 7/10The graphics here are simplistic, but pleasant. It uses the colors red, white, and black effectively. The one real complaint I would have about the graphics is that sometimes the dot showing WHERE you will crash will wobble about sometime, which looks weird.Performance: 4/10I do have a low-powered computer (two cores, $100 video card, 2GB RAM), but I still expected something that looked this simple and obviously could not be too resource consuming to be quick. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Hopefully for most people it won't freeze so often.Features: 6/10IIt does have leaderboards, a hint system and such, but no multiplayer or achievements, which, honestly, I don't mind too much.Ambience: 5/10There's not really much of an ambience, but the game doesn't turn you off with music or sounds or such.Replayability: 6/10You can try to get better times on certain levels, but there's not really much of a point to it. However, this does make the game, essentially, replayable.Summary: 5.2/10I would not reccomend this game to most people. If you like puzzle games and you're not frustrated easily, AND the game is on sale, go ahead and buy it. However, I believe the ordinary player of puzzle games or other genres would quickly grow tired of it.			"

												Normally found on an indie bundle - this little puzzler belongs in the realms of mobile gaming....Certainly reminds me of games back in the day - fire a little ball and see if you can use the various gravitational pulls to last the required amount of time before crashing into anything...It would be a nice little puzzler 'on the go' - but it's complete one-track gameplay means that after 30 minutes you've seen all there is to see... so unless you're a fan of gravitational-based puzzles - you can safely move on...

								What the ♥♥♥♥ is up with the controls for this game? The key-mappings flash for like 1 second when you start the game or go back to the main menu and I have no idea how to go to the next level when I finish one. Why is there no controls screen or anything? Very strange.			"

								A gravity themed puzzle game. You have to shoot your ""thing"" into space and try to orbit around planets/moons/stars for a certain amount of time wihtout crashing or leaving the orbit. Clearly a mobile port, not my type of game.			"

								While not my type of game, I can see why some people would enjoy this ""gravity/physics"" based puzzler.  Honestly though, while the minimilistic style may appeal to some, I personally find free flash-style browser games to have more visual appeal with the same basic game.			"

								Why is the main screen so laggy? Why aren't there options to run at a higher resolution?Orbitalis would be aided by a more precise way of choosing trajectory and power like choosing a trajectory with the mouse and then adjusting it with numbers. Looks like it was designed to be played on your phone and nothing else. Also, there's no way to speed up time. If you fire a good shot you could be sitting there watching it for thirty minutes. That's boring. The game might make some pretty lines but they're not that pretty. If they were bright and crisp it might be better but there's nothing dazzling. The music is pretty generic space tinkling too. I would have enjoyed seeing this in high resolution and full screen and the ability to zoom and something to see if you do zoom. Kerbal Space Flight Program has this sort of thing for when you're going to other planets. You actually get to build and guide your rocket projectile in KSP.			"

												A relaxing puzzle game based on orbital mechanics. Great if you have five minutes (or five hours and a lot of patience) and want to practice your astrophysics. There's not a whole lot to it, but if you like what it offers, then it's more than enough.Pros:Simple gameplay: the only rule you have to know is gravity. Relaxing visuals, and there are few better feelings than getting the perfect orbit.Cons:Can be tiring after completing many puzzles. Best done at most a couple per day. Some bugs with the level selection screen, but nothing that can't be fixed by reloading the game.			"

												Well this is a fun gravity based puzzle game, challenging you to make Orbits around celestial bodys for a certain time. As you prosed their will come more and more bodys in play making it quite challenging latter in the game, and thanks to the workshop lots of fun small challenges. A little annoys is that some of the maps will be mostly based on luck wheter or not you clear it. Overall a fun little game i had fun with on the bus.			"

								0rbitalis is a physics based puzzle game with a minimal input, yet is strangely addictive. Your only goal is to launch 2d shape, among a small solar system of orbiting objects, and see how long it can survive.There isn't a great deal to say about it other than it's good, not great but you can easily sink an afternoon into just unlocking the levels.

								Neat game, but needs some adjustments. Wide screen would be an improvement. Some kind of introductory information would be nice. And the color scheme could really do with some adjustment, there is very little contrast which makes figuring out what objects are going to affect trajectory. All that said, it's still pretty cool. Especially if you just need to kill time without really thinking a whole lot! "

								A fun little puzzle game. I kind of feel like it's not that much of an intellect-based game...it seems at first like maybe if you know a lot about astronomy you'd get an edge, but I don't think that's actually the case. It's more about just trial-and-error'ing your way to good times on the puzzles. Not to say that isn't enjoyable, I've killed an hour or two on this game and since it was very inexpensive I think it was totally worth it. It gets some interesting variation as you progress through the game, increasing the difficulty hugely as you get into it.For some bizarre reason I had problems with the graphics - the game ran very poorly at first, despite the fact that it seems like it shouldn't be so hard to run. I pressed 'q' to turn the graphical quality down and it popped right up, ran perfectly smoothly, and since 'Graphical Quality' to this game is just weird grainy filters on everything I didn't mind one bit.So: if you snag it cheaply on a sale, it's worth it for a couple of hours of frustrating fun.

								Got this game as part of a bundle. A interesting little puzzle game, but still can't figure out if there is skill involved or its more luck of mouse positioning and timing. Its a shame there is not a way to speed up the game rather than having to wait for things to go all the way round if you want to try a later slingshot. The game can also be easily played with an erection and it is Early Access, so could get even better. There is also a different level included every day which is a nice idea, although these seem to be stupidly hard and am not sure if they are randomly generated or pre-made. Not sure if I would pay full price for this, but worth it on a sale or in a bundle.			"

												Great indie game if you are into physics and not in the mood for action.If you just aim it right, get the calculations down and sure dumb luck, you could basically just do one level for hours long until you finally decide to end it. Trust me if you are looking for action, this is definately not you type of game, but if you just want something that you can enjoy watching, this is it. :)			"

 A quick opinion	I'm not against this game but im not towards it either :D. Even though the idea and the basis of the game is good, is it a little to frustrating and bad on a few points. My experience when playing the game on the levels was either, doing it on close to first try or fiddle around until you get lucky and win. So instead of this strategic way of playing the game which basicly only worked on the easy levels to mainly focusing on luck ruined the experience for me and made me not wanting to play it. With that said after trying to focus a little on the achievements and saying ♥♥♥♥ you if the level were a little to tidious was it a little fun. But with that said you can definitely complete the main levels but i didnt find it fun or intreging to play the challenge levels. Worth trying out but don't waste a lot of money on it.			"

												Fun game. Great ambient soundtrack. Although the gameplay is different, atmospherically it reminds me a little of Osmos or Pixel Junk: Eden. I loved both of those games and this one fits right in, although with this game you set your actions in motion and anxiously watch the results unfold rather than actively guiding your every move. If you enjoy astronomy, physics, orbital mechanics, and other related sciences in a cursory fashion like I do, then this might be the one for you. Also, I picked it up on a good sale, just as an FYI. I give this game an overall score of 8/10.			"

												This is a very interesting physics based game.  You are trying to establish a trajectory that meets certain criteria, either a stable orbit, hitting certain targets in the least amount of time, orbiting through different sectors of the screen and so forth.  Some of the levels are very easy, but others are maddeningly difficult.  I keep promising to give up on the last level I have to complete, but I keep coming back and trying again.  No matter how frustrated I get I keep coming back.  This is why I nominated it for the ""test of time"" award.  Good luck and enjoy this simple yet often extremely frustrating game.			"
