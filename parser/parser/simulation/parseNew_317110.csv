												The game should be subtitled: ""The Shakespearean Tragedy That Will Keep You Up At Night""This game is like an abused stepchild that nobody wants and everyone treats horribly. It's a shame to, since beneath the bloody, bruised, scarred surface, there's a gaming masterpiece hidden away!Confused yet? Let me explain.This game dates back to 2005 (ish) and was released in Asia at that time. It was successful enough there to warrant a NA/EU release several years later around 2010. This is still the same game engine, so short of some localization work, if the graphics look dated, there's a reason for it.That part isn't the tragic tale though. This game was able to pride itself on it's behind the scenes mechanics; player economy, crafting, PvP, skills, trading and sailing are all well thought out in depth.When this game was released, nations mattered. Each playable nation was as powerful and influential as the sum of its players. Ports would only open up after a nation had enough influence in the area... and the game world is HUGE. And this actually mattered to the player. Want to craft cannons? Hopefully your nation is in good relations with the port that sells iron!Then, a couple years later, dungeons were introduced for those claiming there was nothing to do in terms of the ""Adventure"" skill set. Of course dungeons have rewards, and those came in the form of rare exotic goods that can be sold for huge profits and a lot of experience.If you're wondering what dungeons and their loot (and money/exp bonuses) are doing in a game that's supposed to be about sailing, exploration and piracy, you're not alone.Netmarble was the publisher at the time and when people started to complain about side-lining all other skills and activities for dungeon-running, the most profitable and least risky, their answer was to increase the number of gold for sale in the cash shop!?Right about that same time, the CEO of Netmarble was arrested for some in-game currency selling scheme he and another employee were suspected of. At worst, it means the game's publisher had a CEO that was readily willing to find ways to profit off of the in-game currency, which was now reaching the ridiculous billion ducat (in-game-dollar) amount, surpassing anything the banks in the game were designed to handle. At best, it meant Netmarble was too preoccupied with the legal hassle to care about the game one way or another. So Uncharted Waters Online suffered either from active abuse or pure neglect.OGPlanet then took it over a couple years down the road. I think the term, ""Too little, too late"" readily applies to the current state of the game and anything OGPlanet has done/intends to do.This game was about the individual player finding ways to help their nation beat other nations in economic struggles, much like history shows occurred in the period the game portrays. THIS was the draw of this game; the active involvement of players in a part of global history. Due to abuses, exploits and neglect that went unchecked for years, this major feature of the game has gotten lost under the muck that's become the game's current state.The final nail in this game's coffin comes at the ease of the solution to all of this, that OGPlanet will not budge on; starting a new server. Given the high-end money-sinks they plan to implement and the in-game profits they plan on managing better, a new server would be the breath of fresh air this game needs. They've made it very clear, however, that they don't plan on doing this.Right now, if you're a new player, that 15,000 Ducat profit you made on a successful trade run will never amount to anything approachable to the 750,000 you can gain by spamming the starter level dungeon in half the time it took to make the one trade run.This game is broken, period. After 4 years of it's NA lifespan, nothing worthwhile has ever been done to fix that. New players will come and go, few will actually stay; my friend's list is proof of that as it's filled with nothing but inactive players from years past.Unless you hear of a new server starting, or a reset coming, avoid the heartache of playing this game. The drama this game has seen in its life will cause most dedicated gamers nightmares!Update:The problem, this game has in its current state (and I'll add this so people know this is still an updated review) is that the numbers don't add up.You can enjoy this game for the first 30 or so levels of a skill, before you get an advanced skill such as shipbuilding or spice trading. The game's fun and everything seems well balanced. Advance past the ""school"" tutorial though and the game takes a drastic turn for the worst.The more advanced, in-game methods for earning money still don't add up to the prices players sell their crafted items for. When you do a real time, 2 hour trade run to earn about 2-3 million ducats and find a simple accessory for your ship, that only adds 1 or 2 points above what the $50,000 ducat NPC equivalent costs, will run about 10 million ducats... the game is broken.When player made items are STILL selling for the billion ducat range and the above-mentioned methods of in-game earning only net a couple million at a time, providing you don't get attacked by NPC and player pirates, catch fire, infested by rats, etc... the game is broken.There's no out-flow of player money. There are plenty of ways to make it, but few ways to spend it that allow it to actually leave the game. The same money that flooded and crashed the game's economy is still floating around the game. There are no... or not nearly enough... in-game expenses to remove this. Ammo, crew, food, repairs, all cost a certain amount, but they don't cost millions to replace, only a few thousand. This game literally had BILLIONAIRES coming out of the woodwork when they screwed the pooch with dungeons and EA goods. Since then, neither Netmarble nor OGPlanet have done anything to actively remove this extra money form the game. They've ""nerfed"" the source of the income, but the money still exists. With that money being in game, prices will still be FUBAR... as demonstrated in the player bazaars.Although it's an open-world game, it's still an MMO. MMOs need goals and right now, this game destroyed those. A new player starting out will never, ever, in any realms of Hell, have any chance of ever being on the same playing field as the 5+ year vets who abused the system in the past. That right there, spells the death on an MMO. As I mentioned and others have confirmd, the early levels sees a large group of active players, but those numbers slow down as the levels get higher... once people realize the cards are stacked against them.I'm saying this as a warning for anyone willing to try this game for the first time: you will not last. Don't let the first few days in-game fool you. You will never be able to compete with the players who took advantage of the broken system years ago.Other than that, yes, the game has some incredible details. That's what drew me in and had me playing for 2 years initially. The days, ocean swells, storms, random events, skills, etc. all suck you in while you're doing something that would be boring in most other games. Catching a rare fish while sailing to South America, for instance. Being right outside of port and getting caught in a major storm. Having your ship suffer from plague, get infested with rats and cacth fire twice as you pass the Straits of Magellan is an experience you NEED to experience in this game. Other games just don't even comapre with this level of realism and authenticity.The game had everything going for it, but its management ruined it all. It causes actual pain for me to think about this potentially great game... and it's tragic downfall. It's the game all MMOs should strive to be, but greed got in the way.			"

												If I were reviwing only the game, I would not hesitate to give it 4 stars. The large open world with countless ports to explore and trade at, the many types of ship to sail, and the deep storyline blending historical accuracy with fantasy is very well done. This is no surprise coming from KOEI who are well known for their deep simulations and stories.The graphics, while dated, serve the game well and each port has a recognizable flavor to it. With many job titles across three archetypes (adventure, trade, and combat) and skill trees for all three, players have great flexibility in how to customize their characters to suit their own playstyle. Many games make this claim, UWO is one of the few to actually back it up with ample content for all career paths, and the game experience does not culminate in endless repetetive pvp. I would give four stars, not five, witholding one for some unclear writing and a cumbersome system for helping others with quests.The playerbase in my experience has been mature, polite and helpful, and the premium content shop is not game breaking. This is not a pay to win game.However, the inclusion of Nprotect GameGuard singlehandedly trumps any and all good points of the actual game (and there are many!) Gameguard advertises itself as an anti-cheat software, but installs itself as a rootkit. You are required to disable any antivirus software, because  gameguard behaves exactly as a virus. This leaves you with no protection while playing an online game, and is unacceptable from a security and common sense view. Even if it worked as intended, this would be unacceptable, but looking over the complaints on the forum make it clear this software does far too much harm, and any claims of it doing any good ar eimpossible to prove. Is the game free of cheaters because of gameguard? Or is it free of cheaters because it is an old game with dated graphics and requires  a reasonable intelligence and attention span to play? Finally, uninstalling the game will NOT remove gameguard, this requires manual removal, instructions can be found via google.Pros:Decent graphics, music and atmosphere.Rich world, dialogue and flavor text, quests have actual storylines to them.Actual content for all play styles, not merely a pvp funnel.Long voyages actually feel like long voyages (This can be good or bad)A freemium game that is NOT pay to win!Cons:Unable to walk around your shipInstalls rootkit on your computer.Customer support has been all but abandoned.Bottom line: If it ever removes the rootkit, its absolutely worth playing. Until then, avoid like the plague.			"

												It's not a casual game, that's for sure. Doing anything takes awhile since sailing is serious business. That said, I love it! The graphics are terrible, the music is repetitive, the on-the-ground combat is probably the worst I've ever seen, and yet I keep double clicking that UWO icon on my desktop.The community, for the most part, is better than any mmo I can remember. They're a mature bunch, most seem to be adults, because uwo really isnt a game for children. It takes patience and planning to get ahead.ship to ship combat is simple but satisfying. The trading system is, again, simple but satisfying as well.I rate the game 7/10, but in my heart it gets a 10 because I think I've found a new home ^^			"

												I have played this game for 16 months now, over 40 hours a week.  Yes i do a lot of not-grinding while chatting with my company or other friends, but I still havent hit the level cap in any of the 3 classes.   This is not your average "" i got to the end of the game in a week, now you want me to stay and do the same things over and over again? "" kind of game.  Bored sailing back and forth to asia to make huge profits trading?  Change ships and hunt some pirates.  Or use maps and quest along the way to find some of the more than 2400 different discoveries in the game.  There are so many different things to do in this game, you will constantly find yourself saying  ""I've been playing for HOW long ?"" .If a world of possiblilities on the open sea is what you are looking for, you just found it.

												I have a lot to say but keep in mind it's from the perspective of a solo PVE player that has seen far from everything. I'll get right down to what I like and don't like.Pros:- The three classes (adventurer, soldier, trader) are distinct, with their own unique abilities. Further, the subclasses (jobs) that you can choose from promote skills, which encourages finding your niche and working on it. This makes for a good sense of progression, character uniqueness and a broad selection of playstyles. For combat there is naval and land, ranged and melee; and adventurers have a range of playstyles, from collecting data around the world, to hunting down shipwrecks, and going on long voyages to make discoveries. Apart from freeform gameplay, there are also semi-randomised quests.-  The world is vast and there's a lot to see. You won't see all the content for hundreds of hours of gameplay. It's not derivative, either - it's awesome when you unlock a new part of the world to explore.- So many different ways to play. There's something for everyone. Adventuring is about long voyages, discoveries and treasure-hunting; maritime and land battles have some options and depth to them; trading is for more patient money-hoarding players with good knowledge of the trade lanes and goods, as well as inventory management.- Plenty of depth in the gameplay, you're always learning more tricks of the trade such as which consumables you're going to need to combat events at sea, or you can pick up skills to do that, or even set an aide to do it for you if they have the appropriate skills. You have many options in character-building and higher levels open up more possibilities.Cons:- The grind. Yeah, getting to the ''endgame'' (top-of-the-line ship and most advanced class) will take many, many hours. Although in this case, it's more about the journey than the destination. This isn't the type of game where you have to be endgame to get access to the worthwhile content. - The tutorials take hours. Seriously, you're looking at 10+ hours to get through all the schools. You don't have to, and you can go your own way at any time and come back later. Still, they are worth doing for the rewards despite the backtracking and awkward dialogue.- Documentation is poor. A lot of things in the game are not self-explanatory, and you won't find written help ingame. I've played for dozens of hours and I still couldn't tell you all the differences between Recog, Search and Observe skills. The good news is, it's not necessary to know every game mechanic. You pick whatever playstyle you want and you learn as you go. Also, the ingame community is very friendly and helpful.- Pay2Win elements. I'm not all that qualified to explain this since I don't play competitively, but there is at least one item that gives you an advantage over other players in the open seas (which are pvp zones): 30% speed boosters. That's huge, and I suspect it can be used to allow even the most sluggish pirate to hunt down even the speedist newb player. Sounds like a doozy. Thankfully, you can chart a course that takes you far from the major sealanes and the coast, for a good chance of avoing player pirates. Still, items like that are disconcerting. Also, buying a monthly subscription (about 15 dollars. Or Euros... hm...) gives you a fat paycheck in ingame currency. I don't know whether to put this under pay2win or not, but I guess if you're seeking pvp, yeah it would allow the subscribed player to get expensive gear sooner. So in my experience, UWO is great if you're after a PVE experience with a Renaissance maritime flavor. I know you don't get many options for that rubric, but it's good. I can't vouch for the pvp however, and you should be prepared for a long (if not steep) learning curve.			"

Posted: October 26, 2014
												After about a week or so playing this game, here are my impressions.Let's get this out of the way first: past masters, Netmarble, ruined this game by introducing a flawed dungeon system which sank the economy...many people have mentioned this in other reviews. Happily, new masters, OGPlanet have fixed this, and have presided over the renaissence of this game, including it's launch on Steam, which has seen a resurgence in player numbers, with many new folk (such as myself) joining the game of late. Problems relating to dungeons are gone and everything is a lot more balanced and fair.Right, on to the actual gameplay: one word - DEEP. This is an extremely detailed, almost dense game. Think EVE on the sea if you want an analogy. It's slower-paced and more thoughtful than your average ""kill 10 boars, then kill 20 bats"" type of MMORPG. There are 3 main skill tree branches under classes for Adventuring, Trading and Maritime (soldier) You can have skills from each. You are not restricted to only trading if you choose merchant at character creation, for example.The Trading aspect is deep and complex, incorporating an excellent crafting system where you can make products from raw materials; make sausages, ham and leather from pigs, tailor your own clothes, design and build your own ship etc.The Adventuring aspect is all about exploration and discovery, incorporating a complete world map where undiscovered cities are added as you discover them. Hunt for treasure in dungeons and ruins, dig up artifacts, indentify new species of animal. There's too many things to list here.The Maritime aspect is where it falls down a bit in my opinion. It's basically the same as other naval or pirate MMOs such as Voyage Century Online and Pirates of the Burning Sea. It's fun, sure, but it's not really my bag. That being said there's a large amount of options and customization as far as cannon, type of shot, melee battle tactics and items and land battle combat to get to grips with.The biggest downsides are the games somewhat dated visuals, serviceable, but nothing too fancy. (on the plus side, this means the game runs on potato-power PCs with no problem) and the tutorial system, which is very long compared to most run-of-the-mill MMORPGs these days. However, I reccommend doing the tutorial quests instead of skipping them, as you will get free ships and gear from completing them, as well as a good amount of money and skills by the time you graduate from the advanced level course in each of the 3 class courses.Last thing to mention is the community. This is easily the friendliest online community I have experienced in a long time. The School chat channel is full of helpful and friendly people ready to answer your questions. This is a blessing, as the game is extremely complex.Overall this is a fun and original game which offers a breath of fresh air from all those ""cookie cutter"" MMORPGs. It's deep and complicated, but rewarding for those who stick with it past the over-long tutorial.			"

												UWO is a game that has a lot of depth but takes up a lot of time, so if you do not have the time, do not read further.Uncharted Waters Online is a fairly old MMO that has been out for a while. I personally played it intensively for a year (when it was under Netmarble and when it was exclusively available on the OGP launcher) before I had to quit due to real life commitments. It is a great game that has a lot of depth due to complex mechanics and the reliance on knowing a lot of things if you want to do it the best way. However, the complexity and the gruelling tutorial system (that feels like real-like work) keep potential players away. Please, I urge you to try to get past it and see the game from an intermediate player's point of view. I know that I initially thought the game was boring during school but grew on me once I kept on playing.If you are looking for a great trading experience online while interacting with others, you are right at home! Even from the beginning, you are introduced to a commodity system similar to stocks (like in Port Royale) with lots of numbers. You can start fresh, trading between Dover and London and etc then eventually work your way to a long-distance Nanban trading routes such as Nagasaki (Japan) <-> London (England). Watching your character grow and your coffers fill up with money is the most satisfying thing in this game. I could say a thousand things about this but you will have to see for yourself. Be warned though, this does take a lot of real-life time so be wary of real life commitments.The combat is great but I have to admit that it is getting aged. The most amount of satisfaction you will get from the combat is beating other players rather than the combat system being great in of itself. It is a basic system of control your ship, choose ammo, and sink/board the enemy ship. I always found the system to be secondary to trade and more important towards the late-game for Epic Sea Feuds (massive player naval combat battle events), pirate hunting, etc. The bottom line is, it is great but don't have too high expectations. It is great FOR ITS TIME.It has a ton of neat features you wouldn’t see in many modern MMOs. Want a customizable apartment with a steward? Done. Want to have cool ships that you saw in those pirate books or movies that you dreamed of? You’re right at home. Want a companion character that helps you perform your job (trading, crafting, pirating, or whatever it may be) and can be dressed up/renamed for your every little fetishes? Done deal. Where have you seen a game with literally over a hundred cities and the world size that takes you half of real-life to go around? It is truly a gem that needs to be appreciated more.The community for the most part is very dedicated and friendly. If you can meet their expectations and be dedicated yourself, they will love you and you will love them. If you are looking for a great experience playing a slow-paced MMO you can sink your time into and make a lot of long-term friends, you will like UWO. However, if you are looking for a more faster paced MMO with emphasis on action-packed PvP and PvE raiding combat, you may want to look at a more modern MMO. This is an old-school MMO that does not hold your hand and it is up to you to stand up on your feet and reach up to it.tl;drThis game is good, give it a try.Be warned that it is a time vampire.Say goodbye to the outside.

												I've played this game on and off for a few years now and am glad it's come to Steam, if a bit late. Comparing it to other mmorpgs, I'd say the difficulty level is a little more challenging than most. KOEI is known for making historically accurate games and this one is no exception. While it was released to asian markets only for the first several years, it has been available for the rest of the world for the past several. It's as old as Word of Warcraft, but is free-to-play. Also something to note, it is *not* pay-to-win, like some f2p games are. Some of the best items/ships are potentially/statistically superior, it isn't such a noticable difference, unless in the hands of an unskilled/inexperienced player. And there are a LOT of ships to suit your playstyle. Concerning playstyles, there are 3 major ways to play the game, and you can change it up as you see fit without too much hassle. Adventuring, Trading, and Battling. Adventurers have probably the closest to a single-player experience as you can get on an mmo, and won't be disappointed with the historical discoveries, locations and treasures that come from diligence. Trading is probably one of the easiest tasks, and is practiced by every player-type. Many different trade goods from various regions of the world and a very deep economic structure that changes prices of goods depending on supply/demand and trading tendencies of other players. Maritime (sea battles) is one of the more appealing features to newcomers and seasoned players alike, and UWO has probably the best sea-battle gameplay around.PVP exists in the majority of sea zones throughout the world but only the truly skilled maritimers can benefit from a life of piracy on the high seas. I've been pirated only a handful of times in the years I've played and it should be noted that it isn't something to deter you from going where you want to go. There is a healthy balance to all things.As for the community of players, some of the nicest and most helpful players abound here! There are so many intricacies to the gameplay, I still learn something new daily, and nearly everyone has an answer or an idea to help you along. We're really all in it together! Instead of ""guilds"" like other mmorpgs of a historical era, there are Companies. Each is a maximum of 50 players. This is a great way to keep the members tight with each other, and promotes a feeling of having an 'extended family' instead of just other gamers.If you are a fan of ridiculous amounts of loot and items, then you will be disappointed. There are a ton of items in the game, but space is always your enemy.. or friend? You gotta know what to keep and what to sell/discard. It's good to keep that greed in check.Pros: Great community of players. Deep and challenging gameplay. Developers did their homework when it comes to history and facts. Educational and relaxing, solid variety in all things, in-game achievements (memorial album/challenge missions). Prioritization is an optional skill you involuntarily acquire that is helpful in life. :D. Locations, player models/outfits, ships, sailing, and even the music(which I mute to listen to radio) still has a unique charm.Cons: Grinds (it's a game created by Asians!). Somewhat frustrating interfaces that seems to have a higher learning curve. Only 1 message window for all information in game, be it chat, announcements, crafting, battle...everything. I still gripe about wanting another window to keep conversations separate from everything else. Graphics are a bit dated, if that is important to you.I could go into much more detail about specifics, but this is already longer than I intended. So, as far as free-to-play mmorpgs go, and even comparing it to subscription mmorpgs and the multitude of games I've played throughout my existence on this planet, I'm going to rate it a solid 7/10.I hope to see some of you there.

												Yep I would recommend. ****short version and important warning at bottom****I read a bunch of reviews on this game before I downloaded it and never felt quite so compelled to write a review for a game as this one. I'm gonna try and keep this brief, at the time of writing I have a mere 2 hours into this, so I'm no grand commadore of the Uncharted Waters. I can tell you a few things though, This game is no ""Diamond in the rough"" it's more like a ""Black Opal in the rough"" (Black opal being much more rare and precious comparatively speaking.)It is a beautiful smathering of wonderful gameplay dynamics, this game combines a bunch of elements that normally one would find overly annoying, difficult to learn and painstakingly problematic in implementation. The reality is at first glance it only appears overwhelming. Once your boat hits the water and you sail away from Port everything falls into place with wonderful simplicity. The game play seems to be really well thought out and there are still a bunch of really great active players, that are not only helpfull but mature, funny and provide a ""living world dynamic"" to the game that I don't think I've seen quite anywhere else other then maybe Rift (with out the bots.) This game has all the componets that I wish many other pirate (naval) games I've played could have incorporated in such smooth form.That being said... It's not perfect. While I'm understanding of what the limits of technology can provide; ten, twently years ago, I also like to take into consideration that for a new player to download it today, your time could be just as easily spent playing any of the new games that are out now. Additonally, you need to understand the game is dated. Its customer support exists, but is otherwise dead.  The game has been launched to different countries over the course of, at the time of writing, 10 years. Its first realease in Korea/Japan 2005, NA/ Europe 2010 and SEA 2011.  While the opening is valuable, it is REALLY slow. The graphics are dated and its controls are awkward and clumsy. Generally, a game that just seams unpolished/unfinished, at least by today's standards. On the plus side it is free! and it's not pay to win! What to take away:If your looking for a great game to sink some time into that has a decent story, great mechanics, involved community, and a pirate theme that won't bite deep into your pocket book, this is for you. Just be prepared for an unenthusiastic entrance, a lackluster finish and an interface that is just simply to me, moronic. *Short Version*Pros'-Excellent dynamic and game play elements.-Large expansive world that requires exploration. -A community that is just plain unwilling to die.-Did I mention an ecredibly well designed game play concept and theme-Free play game that isn't pay to win-Pirate (naval) themed!-Solid Storyline- I don't want to quote the wiki here but they do a great job at explaining, I'll simply say (STNG meets pirates>? maybe that's fair?Cons'-Dated Graphics-Awkward controls-???? explained later under warning-Glitchy command interface* (*glitchy may not be the right term, but just not feng shui... Clashy maybe?)*WARNING*I've read a lot of complaints saying this game disables your virus protection in favor of it's own security measures. According to them, it is to prevent the possibility of cheating. I don't believe this to be the case, any longer. I've never had any prompts that suggest my AVG is being disabled, or anything of the sort. That being said, I run a dual boot system with seperate hard drives; I use one HD for gaming so if anything happens to it I don't worry, maybe cry about lost progress, but most games I play back up character data and progress on their server. So, it's really just my personal customization to worry about, should anything be lost at that point. It should be noted, I've never taken the time to see if my virus protection is being disabled on the back side.Happy Gaming, I hope this helps!			"

												The most common reasons this game is hated are the following:Uses third party DRMExtremely tedious(At the beginning)The prior is admittedly an issue, however the latter is misunderstood.Uncharted Waters Online is an extremely relaxing game. When you begin the game you have to make the choice between becoming a fighter, a trader, or an adventurer.*KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS DECISION DOES NOT DETERMINE YOUR ENTIRE GAME, YOU CAN CHANGE BETWEEN CLASSES AT ANY TIME, AND THERE ARE BENEFITS TO DOING PRECISELY THAT.*-A fighter, as you might imagine will battle AI ships for the majority of their time playing, and will eventually enter PvP where they can have a lot of fun if you enjoy PvP. There are MASSIVE rewards to playing in PvP events.-A trader does not JUST trade, they also craft non-purchaseable master level items that players can use. For example: extremely powerful hulls, extremely powerful cannons, and extremely good sails. The majority of the in-game economy revolves around these items.-Finally, the adventurer. The adventurer does not have any actual purpose in PvP or money making, as it is out done by the fighter and trader respectively. *HOWEVER* The adventurer has the *FASTEST* ships, and discovering and doing adventure quests can be extremely fun if you have the patience, Albeit as tedious as the other 2 classes with less rewards.Now, most players who complain about the game being too tedious have never actually completed the tutorial (key word MOST) I understand that many will find the length of the ""tutorial"" extremely absurd. However, keep in mind this game is absolutely massive and extremely complex, so knowing all the information, at the very least the basics, will benefit you massively if you intend to keep playing. The game also rewards you MASSIVELY if you complete the tutorial, with good mid-level ships and nearly a million of the ingame currency being given to you, practically just for reading text.Contrary to what some believe, the tutorial is COMPLETELY SKIPPABLE, it is NOT MANDATORY IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM, but if you don't do it, it is likely you will be even more upset with not knowing what you're doing than you would have been if you had simply completed the tutorial. However if you feel your odds are better by trying your luck by yourself, by all means, please do that.The majority of the community is extremely helpful. I recommend attempting to join a Company as soon as possible, but School Chat is extremely helpful as well. If you have a problem, let people in school chat know.			"

												I've been a huge fan of Koei's games since way back in the SNES / Super Famicom days.  Though I haven't played this one through steam, I have logged over 1k hours on and off over the last few years.  This game at it's core really is a good adaptation of the Uncharted Waters series into an MMO. The original version, launched in Japan in 2005 as a subscription based game,  looks like it's close to what I would consider an ideal MMO for a simulation junkie.  And that is what makes the version published here in the west such a bitter disapointment.  The after market cash shop they tacked on cheapens every aspect of the game.  It turns what was designed to be a repetitive but rewarding experience into an all out slog, a slog that spending 50 USD per month barely mitigates.  Many systems have been nerfed or slowed down from the original design in order to coerce players into whipping out a credit card to speed them back up.  The game is set up to have an incredibly robust player economy where all the best ships and items are crafted by players.  Top tier items in this version come only from the cash shop. Powerful ships better than anything a player can make come only from their lottery box. Certain recipes are cut from the crafting proffesions entirely so the items they make can be sold for cash.  Most of these items are tradable in game, but the fact that players can not make them on their own ruins most of the charm and intent of the design.It is possible to get somewhere that resembles ""end game"" without forking over a fortune, but to do so would involve putting yourself through thousands of hours of doing nothing in game but grinding resources.  During this time you'll be repeatedly zoomed passed at sea and destroyed in combat by newer players that shelled out a couple hundred bucks for their ships. Ships were supposed to be a part of character progression, they have level requirements to sail.  Even the highest end cash shop ships have level requirements so low that they can be reached in a couple weeks of play. I can't reccomend this game but there is a lot here to like. Insanely complex systems, trading, dungeon running, exploration, naval combat, a combination of skill based and level based advancement, layers and layers of systems you'll still be discovering and figuring out hundreds of hours after you start.    If you've got a high tolerance for repetition you can get to ""competitive"" levels of gear and ships and money without taking out a second mortgage on yoru house, but you'll likely never make it to a true end game on completely equal terms with those that spend thousands. The in game markets are all dominated by players juggling in game money and cash. The high end naval battles are dominated by players who spend hundreds of dollars on their character development and ships.  If you started from scratch and only ran one account it would take years to begin approaching established players like that, and that's assuming you know the game and can play efficiently.  Still, if you really need a hobby and have a big chunk of disposable income and / or a few thousand hours to spare this game might be worth checking out.  If you're like me the more you learn about it the more disappointed you'll be, but there is some fun to be had.  Particularly if you don't mind multiboxing 3+ accounts and have a core group of friends that did the same, you could accomplish a lot in this game and have a blast.  If Koei stopped liscensing this thing out to 3rd rate lottery box companies and gave us the option to play the subscription model I'd be there in a heartbeat.  I'd also start from scratch if Koei ever puts out a first - party international free server with a more balanced approach to the cash shop and what they sell in itI've got a real love / hate relationship with this thing.  I'm not sure if there's any real solutions for all the problems caused by the tweaking of the game around the cash shop, and making the game require a subscription would totally annihilate the already tiny player base.  While the review paints a picture of the game being completely ""pay 2 win""  free players and small time spenders can get a decent game out of it, especially power gamers that run multiple accounts and exploit every mechanic and design flaw that they can.  It's frustrating because 1/3rd of the game or more is designed as an economics / trading simulation and that gameplay is mostly circumvented by players generating their money from selling things out of the cash shop.  The upshot is that most of the stuff in the cash shop is available for in game currency if you can find a seller at least.  I think the whole ""lottery box"" model is a terrible pyschologically manipulative business as well, hooks gambling addicts like no other.  Anyway just ranting now, I'm leaving the review as thumbs down but as I mentioned there is still a decent game here and if you love the age of sail, pirates, plunder, exploration, discovery, and in game economies it's worth taking for a spin, assuming you're ready for an epic grind.  I'd suggest that if you spend money at all you wait until you really understand the game, I watched power hungry new players getting ripped off every day in the trade channels.  The learning curve is too high to get any value out of early game cash purchases, and when you do start to understand the game you'll realize the value of most of the digital junk they sell is very low.

												I would have to say that I quite enjoy this game. Its Eve Online meets the high seas without the spreadsheet BS.[GRAPHICS] -The game graphics are itself dated but considering it was released a long time a go and only became available to Americans/Europeans somewhat more recently ( a few years ago). The character and city graphics are gawdy but are acceptable as you will be on the high seas and the ship details/water is where its at. [SOUND/MUSIC] - The music isn't half bad and can be quite refreshing at first. It will change as you enter different territories/cities. It will become annoying after awhile if your constantly in one city or nation due to it being your home/ doing school quests. The ship sounds, (disaster, bell, etc) on the sea are a real nice touch as you travel.[ENGINE] - This game is reaaaally easy to run as its an older engine. So anything can pretty much run it.[GAMEPLAY] - This is where this game shines!, You can choose to either be a  trader, Adventurer, or Maritime ( <-- pirate basically ). You can trade goods for profit from one region to another, invest in towns to get your hands on unique goods, Find shipwrecks and bring them to the surface for a chance at getting very good loot to keep or sell. You can choose to be maritime, to either support your nation in wars, or ambush other players across the high seas to steal there cargo. While doing all this, you have to deal with giving your crew food/water, dealing with fatigue levels, etc. The dynamics of those 3 classes really flourish once you have joined an active company  or bought yourself a home to store goods. The game becomes soo much better after you push through the schools ( which do provide some useful info for beginners)4/5 - The game itself can be quite addicting once your past all of the school quests. Some of the school quests are crap, others provide some basic/useful information to keeping you or your crew alive while on the seas. Each school provides money/ships/port permits once completing everything.  The gameplay becomes the core reason players who have endured the tutorial keep playing, so I suggest giving it a thorough try. I give it a 4/5 simply for the graphics being a bit dated ( which cant be helped), and some of the tutorial quests being bland and a bit pointless.			"

												If you like Trading, Sailing a Wooden Ship, Becoming a Pirate or just Discovering new places then you should like this game. I played the first version of this game on the NES way back in the late 80 - early 90 and when I found this version I had to try it out. I like playing this game so much I don't want to stop play it. Everytime I log off to go to bed/work or something else I can't wait to get back and start playing again. You can play for free or you can buy yourself some help but either way it will take time to level up all the different skills with in the game. The game has a lot of very helpful people and you can join a company if you want and most of them will help you with leveling and learning how to play the game and all the other little things you will need to know to be a good player. You can start as a new player and grow and learn without having to worry because when you start in Europe it is a safe zone or safe waters as it called in game and you can't be attacked by other player as you start leveling and learning the game. Once you reach different levels you will get permits that will allow you to move to different areas. Before long you will be sailing around the world trading or fighting whichever way you want to play the game.			"

												I used to play this when it was owned by NetMarble, and I was looking to come back and play.Luckily I did come back to it just after the merge had been completed after OG brought the game and I see some new content has been added and some extra stuff which is great to hear and I hope they continue developing the game.If OG did a Graphics overhaul inside the game and made the cities bigger with more things to do in them then it will improve the game so much more and cater to a wider MMO audience, it's already on a great enngine and the acutal game mechanics are pretty sound and interesting.OG have made the game slightly easier for newer players on Steam, as you get extra Gear In game when you hit certain Level milestones, which is good as it means new players get a kick start to try and catch up with everyone else, yet Im sure the older players would be a little annoyed that they didnt have to graft as much lol.All in all, it's a great game, with 3 actual games in one. As you can choose to play as an Adventurer, Trader or Battle Pirate (or all three together if you play it long enough) and each one's Style is completely different to the others.It can take up some time, so be prepared to sit at your screen for hours on end, but it's by no means boring. You will just be sailing around the entire world map after (real life map with Major Cities in it).It does take an hour or two to get into and get through the (optional) tutorial and work everything out if your a new player but don't let that put you off it! BEST Points:- Pirate Game (need we say more?)- Friendly Community and People Help in Chat- Companies (aka a Guild/Clan)- Thousands of Quests- Thousands of Ship/Armor/Weapons and other Item Combinations- Heaps of Skills to Learn and Play With- Epic Battles with your Friends with NPC Pirates- Epic Battles between other Countries in PvPCosnidering it's Free it's actually pretty amazing, they do offer in game purchases but these are no way necessary so you don't need to spend ££$$ if you don't want to, you just have to put a little more time in.If you find a nice Company (guild) to Join then they will almost certainly help you out with extra gear and money to start you off if you get to know them anyways.Download It, Spend some Time on It, Love It...

												So to start this game you pick a destination to begin you're journey.There are six location's such as spain,london and some other really nice tropical places I forgot there names xD. I picked London because it looked like a♥♥♥♥♥♥hole compared to the others and I want the feeling of looking foward to going to a nice bohama island in the future of playing this game. When i started playing this game around say 50 minutes ago I had no clue what to do and still very much the same but that will soon vanish. The gameplay to this is very complex, reminds me far to much of everquest gameplay. Every little tiny bit of content just seems to carry more content and complexity and I love that! It feels like you achieve somthing everytime you complete a new task or a new skill!There is no auction house :'( which is the only dissapointment I have atm, but as suffisicated as this game is they make you the auction house! You must bargain with other player, sell your good's and make an absolute fortune or even make your self titled as king merchent.The graphics are nice :) The content is insane! I have been told there are easily over 500 ships in this game and each one can be designed by you! With over 1000 decoration pieces it seems rare to spot a twin of you're ship :'). I allways spot people wearing different clothing and different weapons. Its rare to spot someone looking the same as someone else. Unless of coure you are a noob liek me and are still wearing you're student uniform :p.The world map is our world map. The uncharted waters page on steam simply states there are over 180 locations to be explored including the entire ocean. Last of all the community! I have not been in a kinder comunity ever! as soon as i hopped on world chat I was warned about certain people camping at certain spots waiting to kill other people. But hey I was told by a group of people that they would protect me! and help me out if i ever get attacked and one of my new friends said if i ever want a player killed that i should tell him ;). Soi yes in under an hour I have now made two new friends :S. I was also offered one million dollars from each player I was talking to in the world chat <3.I cant wait to explore and venture forth through out this game even more! So far I absolutely love it!10/10Great gameplay, Awesome amount of content! "

												Played this one a couple years but have not tried in steam. Im thinking of starting a steam version now. The game has plenty of depth and is very hard to learn. The visuals are dated but if you get past that and survive the first couple of days, get into a company and you will learn to appreciate how games should be made. If your a run and gun player who loves the next big thing then you will hate it. If your more old school who loves depth of content and want to continue learning for a couple of years then this will be right up your alley			"

												I've played this game for a month now.There is a LOT you can do in this game.  You can be a Merchant, Adventurer, or Maritme Fighter.  Or any combination of those three.  I am playing a Merchant, but I have more Fame from beating up NPC Pirates.I highly recommend going to school.  Easiest way to learn the game, and gain plenty of experience as well.  Yes, they are a thinly disguised tutorial, but you get free ships, experience, and detailed information about how to play.The community is extremely helpful.  If you get confused about something, someone will probably help you if you ask questions in the chat.  Or send you a link to one of the several wiki sites.  Or both.This game is worth playing.  The learning curve is a bit steep, and will annoy people, but it is worth playing.			"

												TL;DR version: It's a good game, can do lots of different stuff, never need to pay to succeed.I've always wondered how it would feel to play the old games on a new system with an engine that took advantage of new hardware capabilities. Most re-launches are poorly produced, but not this one! This game is exactly what I would have expected from the old SNES title, plus some obligatory MMO features (some of which weren't entirely uncommon in Japanese titles even back then, to be fair). I probably read too many ad testimonials, but that's the best way I can describe my first and lasting impression of the game.It's a trading sim, a naval battle sim, and even a point-click adventure game; all rolled into one. You have the option of pursuing any adventure you want, whenever you want, with a dedicated community that (usually) offers useful help. Read the wiki (there are 3 different ones) please, though. The highest end stuff is of course paid for with real money, but you don't need it to be successful. Another reason I'm still playing the game after two weeks.			"

												Been playing this game off of Steam since May 2014.Here's a brief review of the pros and cons, as per usual:Pros:1. Open world map2. Large plethora of jobs3. Variety of playable nations4. Lots of ships to choose from5. Very interesting storylines (depending on chosen nation too)6. Lots of people7. Trading is very fun8. Sailing to new lands is a unique challenge9. NOT a pay2win! The only use for real currency is for the purchase of ""Astros"", which can only buy certain documents/clothes etc=Lots more but these are basically the main ones!Cons:1. You need to invest a lot of time in this game to get good stuff (ships, money etc)2. You need specific port permits to enter ports in certain continents3. Sailing long journeys can get boring4. The graphics aren't the best in the world5. Takes quite some time to go up levels without help from other people6. Links to 5 & 1Overall it's a very nice unique little game if you're into middle-ages sailing/exploration/trading games, however, unless you have a lot of time on your hands or if you're very very patient - don't push yourself to enjoy it, as you either do straight away or don't.Thanks for reading :)			"

												It has massive contents, even comparing to World of Warcraft. It has almost every corner of the real world map implemented, which no other naval games have done.It's slow paced, slow progressing. It will suit you well if you are looking for a game to just relax. It's still the first choice for openworld/sandbox light weighted casual naval RPG after all these years.Recent updates made the game better, in terms of user interface and early gameplay.			"

												My favorite MMO of all time and in my top 5 of any type of game. It's so unique. If you are at all interested in ships or playing a different kind of game that isn't a Diablo or WOW clone this is for you. A lot of the game isn't fast paced but i enjoy that aspect. It feels like the world is big when sailing about. You get the feeling of being out on the sea and aventuring. The school at the beginning is excruciating so be aware of that and know that when you make it through the game gets 1000x better. The high points of the game are; lots of things to do, very unique sailing experience, being a pirate, fighting pirates, escaping from pirates, well done economy, runs great on low end systems, you can play and enjoy the full game without spending real money, freedom, PVP (consenting and otherwise), rum, discovering intriguing things in history, many ships types to sail, regularly updated, the company that runs the server is engaged in the game, many dedicated and helpful players. Low points are; quite a bit to get orientated to on the start, little in game info (use uwodbmirror.ivyro.net and the uwo wiki to find things), graphics are decent but not modern (doesn't bother me), there are some fantasy and blatantly historically innaccurate aspects, npc characters are not inspiring.Explanation of the three job types. Also you can mix and match skills from any and switch about all you like so don't feel like you have to commit to one solely. Maritime: battle orientated. This can be from fighting to take over cities and ports in epic sea feud to fighting pirates to being a pirate. You can fight on ships, on land, in arenas, duel, use guns, cannons, swords, bows, knives, explosives and many other assorted goodies.Trade: Fairly like you'd expect. Buy low sell high or craft things. Best way to make money in the game. There are ""local specialty goods"" in the game. You get more money and experience by taking these goods to ports farther and farther away from where they are produced. Some of these can be crafted from raw materials increasing profit even more Adventure: seeking out new discoveries. This encompasses a lot. Discoveries can be anything from hidden treasure, to anient cities, to geography, to sunken ships, to art or religious artifacts, to exotic animals and new locations. You find what is interesting to you and there is a lot to find. Most of the things you find are actually historic items or places ect which is fun for me being a history buff but you don't have to be one to get satisfaction from finding the stuff.			"

												Uncharted Waters Online will not win awards for flashy graphics. Yet at its core is a game that will not be mastered with a couple months of play even. This game is a long term investment, one that will not reward the players looking for something fast. Yet it is fun, if a slow paced deep game is what interests you. Their is a rich skill system, that rewards a well planned out character,  and plenty of things to keep you entertained.I have two things to critise for this game.  1. If you want to make money, you need to level trading and your not going to survive without making money. Parts and Equipment break, and need to be replaced, and without cash. Adventuring can be awesome, once you get going, being able to locate some impressive places. Sea Battles, have a level of strategy, but will end up costing alot in replacement parts. There are methods of making money without trading directly due to player run economy, but having the trade levels still helps out significantly.2. While the game is Free to play, it would be exceptionally challenging to go without spending money to get things. There is alot of useful tools that make life significantly easier, and definitely some parts of the game are made significantly easier by spending actually cash. Just be careful or this game can very quickly become not all that free if you get carried away.Overall the game is fun, and their is alot to it. The comunity in the game is fairly helpful as well. I definitely recommend, finding a good ""Company"" as their are alot of helpful high level players, who are willing to help out a lowbie.			"

												First off, this game is amazing. No doubt. It is also not for the people who quit when things get hard, because in UWO, things are never easy. In a good way!Pros:Ships - There is a humongous supply of ships, not to mention all the possibilities of custom made shipsNaval Battles - No game quite captures the thrill of a battle on the high seas like this, as you need to think strategically and use skills wiselyOutfits - There are a ton of outfits, for whatever kind of seaman you want to beCommunity - The community is mature (for the most part), and everybody is willing to help new players, so long as they take it seriouslySailing - Sailing is actually difficult *gasp* and takes practice to become better at *guy faints in back row*. Sailing does take practice, and it takes time to get from point A to point B. There's no fast travelCons:Graphics - Sorry, but they're undefendableLand Battles - Possibly the worst ground based combat I have ever seenMusic - Music is good, but is very repetitiveStoryline - Just ignore it. Complete school, and then just stay away from story missions. Make sure to complete school though, you'll be sorry if you don'tSchool - Boring, and very repetitive, but you NEED to complete it to stand a chance in this gameDungeons - Wondering why there are dungeons in a seafaring game set in the 17th century? Yeah, me tooThis game gets a 92/100, for even with all these cons, they are part of the nonessential experience. All the pros have to do with the core of the game, and it is absolutely a must-have in any players library.			"

												I swear on my allmighty lord Gabens hairy nipples, this is the best sea-based mmo i have ever played. UWO is probably one of the most underrated games out there, though there are reasons for it. The graphics are dreadful and the land combat system is on todays standards fu*king terrible. Still, you won't believe how thrilling it is to sail from indo-china to europe for hours on your trading vessel, and then making a huge profit selling the treasures of the east on the european market. Or hunting a notorious pirate on the seven seas and finally, after a long and tense battle in the middle of a raging storm, sinking that motherfu*kers enormous battleship for good.  The map is huge, and basically covers the whole world, including Europe, Africa, Asia and America. Since my in-game profession is merchant, the trade system means alot for me. There's so much to say about it, but covering it all would take quite some time, so i'm just gonna say that it's freaking great. It has many great features, such as the concept of regional speciality goods.  Alot of the veterans of the game are saying that the tranfer of ownership of the game from netmarble to ogplanet was some kind of a game-breaking turn, but since i haven't been playing this for that long, i can't really say anything about that. I quess that you'll just have to read other people's reviews to find out more about that.  Over all, UWO is one of those games that you just have to try out so see if it fits you. If you can forgive the game for it's outdated graphics, repetitive music, and other negatives, then you just might like it.I freaking love it, and i'm sure that i'll be spending alot of time getting my hands dirty with this game.

												The game world is very very large. To live in this world you must atleast complete 3/4s of the tutorial. But man is the tutorial extensive and helpful. There are tons of ships to choose from verrying from the region. Graphics for a game of this age are OK. All in all it's a pretty good game don't expect pay to win. It runs even on the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC's. I could easily sink 50+ Per week in this game. 8/10 Go try it			"

												It's really nice game and should be more popular. You can choose your profession (adventurer, trader or marine) and just sail all around the world. There are always something new to discover and even more fun when you sail with friends. Investigating ancient places, trading from one country to another or just be a pirate!			"

												Unchartered Waters works and I have Windows 10. At first glance this game appears simplistic, even somewhat basic. Having played it for months, then months off and now months of being back into it... I feel it is one of the most enjoyable games out there. If you want battle all the time- you got it. If you want to take it easy and strategize- you got it. If you want to learn how to trade and make money (ducats) in a somewhat realistic fashion- you got it. Just when you think things are simple you find multiple layers of skills and storylines that you never knew were there.  Management throws in ship races, trivia, etc. to add to the enjoyment.Now you are not going to pay to skill up quickly, so this is the real challange and admiration for those who have. Mature players will love or grow to love this game and the many members of its community. Great game!			"

												There are to many pros and cons to list here, but I do recommend giving this a try if you are a gamer who can think and like long term commitments. This game is simply Amazing in so many ways, even with its faults. I just started playing a month ago, and i am totally hooked.   As far as free to play games, this is simply the best. if you dont put a penny into it, its still great fun. I personally like to support the games i play, and this one is worth the cash shop it provides. The % to give you a great items from the store items  are its only down side, as the % is so terribly low.Overall i am gonna rate this game a 6.5 out of 10. This is the game i am gonna play and stay with for a long time to come, but it does have some very bad mechanics in it. Which i can live with. But ive found a nice community of people and once you learn to play, it becomes rather enjoyable.			"

												i have never played this game in its glory days so i cant compare it then and now but i CAN give a fresh perspecitvethis is a great game if you have the patience to take the school courses as they get VERY monotonous repetitive and complicated also you need the willpower to constantly try annd level your character this game is about trading and turning your character into an expert in the field that you choose not combat so go away you COD fanboysthe graphics are in dire need of a rehaul if the game is to become a competitor among the other major MMO's out there HOWEVER it graphics are not displeasing just datedwhile the game is not focused on combat combat is still prevalent however its combat system can be divided into 2 parts the land battles and the sea battles the land battles are somewhat of a turn based game with the exception of being able to use items...in short its boring but forces you to not afk because in land battles medicine and other items and other items and ""techs"" aka skills can be cast to give you the upper hand in a battlesea battles are ALSO boring as it mostly cosists of ships circling each other trying to flank each other and score a critical hit because usually you will only do 1 damage to another ship no matter how many cannons you have or how powerful they are....unles you completely outclass the other ship that isthe cities are fairly large or small...depending on where you go but it all feels superficial list buildings are just props and most of the people only have one line...i understand that this was great back in the day but now...it feels like the movie legend where the guy walks into the shop full of maniquens and pretends that theyre real peopleits best feature at least IMO is its trading the trading is very versitile and very engaging as you have to learn the average prices for items and decide where and when to sell your items like say you buy trade goods in london and you sell to dover which is only a short sail away you will only get a small return if at all whereas if you go from london to naples you can make quite a fair bit of money depending on what goods you have and how much of itthere IS a main storyline too however i personally like it alot but others say they hate it they story is weak and the characters are boring but not to me i guess its you like it or you hate ittheres are sevreal non-combat skills that can turn some great profits however they do take time to grind and effort so dont expect to max out your level in 2 daysoverall this game is definetly at least worth a try			"

												TL;DR - a decent, relaxing, time-sink of a sea-exploration game.PROS:- the game world is already familiar even if you've got a crap sense of geography- as a general rule, people are friendly to game newbies- XP is easy to get, and OGPlanet are pretty generous with in-game gifts: at one point I dropped out for a few days and I got an email enticing me to come back with in-game loot. You get loot for hitting achievements in the game too, and the loot items are very, very useful at low levels- you get loot by doing the tutorial quests- IT'S FREE!- there's no super-rigid questing involved, it can be as intense or as laidback as you want it to be- unintentional hilarity, such as having to put on a disguise to get anything done in Islamic countriesCONS:- the graphics are dated and obviously Japanese; it can be a turn off- when cut-scene conversations happen they are VERY LONG and seem pointless- the tutorial quests are tedious- pace can feel infernally slow for some players- when you're sailing in your ship there really isn't much to do but steer			"

												A great game about naval life in mid XVI century or so... You can become trader, pirate, military officer, or even adventuer, who looks for treasures, fighting through huge variety of enemies and traps, or collects unique animals and visits ancient places. The game has pretty large variety of nations to play for, aswell as jobs. You can change your job at any time, or change part of skills, creating your unique character class, with it's unique characteristics... Fight on the land, or on the sea, complete different quests, travel through different countries and cities. Fight pirates, or even go and settle your own colony at America! What else can I say?... Set Sail!!!			"

												After playing for a few hours, The tutorial (storyline) mission has taken me a long time that is the only draw back so far, but since it was a ported game from overseas I think they just took all of the main mission and combined it into a single long RPG-ish mission system. The game playes more like a naval sim from the 1700's but with a nice arcade feel to it. I played PotBs and it has way more features that that game. If I had to knock it I would have to say they could have thought out the storyline mission in a much better fashion. It is however completly F2P and no subscriptions required. They have a cash shop but nothing in it can break the actual gameplay. Every thing in game eventual out-paces the cash shop, so there are no fears of a pay to win issue. Im enjoying it and recomend it to anyone looking for that good pirate/naval sim that is so lacking in the game community now.			"

												Create the Character and Jump to the Sailing Sim MMORPG.I saw some suggestion from the persons who play and stay in this game than other Online Game.As I expected. This game is a good One Game that I easily addict to the [Easy Going Atmosphere]. Graphic is not that Great in the total but Sea Sailing and Water Appearance is So Impressive.Navy Battle is turn out simple but Cool. Turn your ship and Fire them up by the side Cannon or Just Ram in to the enemy ship and crush them with Sailor Melee Attack. Sailing town to town. Pick up some goods from town and go to sale them in another town. Remember the good price on the specific town and do repeat it until the price drop (LOL). But Careful in combat, Navy is not that hard but land combat is (IMO) S_CK.But this game is not that easy as the [Easy Going Atmosphere] they give you. You need a good management of financial in game to keep the pocket money, Bank Interest, Character supply and Ship's Situation. Anything can happen in the OCEAN and you never know what kind of incident will come to you. The Crew starved dead because you forgot to fill up the supplies, Sailor's illness like Homesick, Rat out Break, Pirate Ambush or Weather Disaster....You can prepare your ship to survive almost of this encounter but yes, money in the basic needs for them....So Real, Right ?The game is not that crowed, the town atmosphere is lonely and need more NPC walking around than now. (Just walk, no need to interface is ok) The game's Opening is Impressive. OST is GREAT.A lot of details look complicate but if you get use to it, you will find yourself addict to this UWO 2nd age.

												Still pay 2 win garbage. Here is what you will do, you will log in find out that the game is huge and looks complicated and fun. Then you will see all the high end ships, then you will figure out that these ships come from gambling bottles, then you will either do one of 2 things. You will quit because you see the trap, or you will do what the tiny few that play this game do, gamble on bottles, try to sell the garbage in game, and that is about it. The people in the game of course will swear to you that the game is not pay 2 win, as they have already spent upward of 5 grand, and want you to get addicted to the cash shop like them. Then you will have the people who spent the last 6 years playing telling you its not pay 2 win, because they grinded un godly hours to get high in the game.Let me put it this way, to get to master ship builder even with the cheats from the cash shop, will take you over 500 hours or more. Then your gonna find out if you didnt before, the only way to build ships is if you buy SSIP things which are sold on the cash shop, and cannot be obtained in the game unless some one buys them from the cash shop. Then your gonna realises that no ship you can ever make, beats the ships in the cash shop, and on and on we go.Toxic community, pay 2 win cash shop, pirates have all the advantage because they have played for years, and dumped thousands in the cash shop, and you have no chance to beat them, well of course if you grind the 1000+ hours, and dump a grand or so in the cash shop you will be able to be equal in terms of gear and ships. Don't waste your time or money on this sinking ship, it prolly wont be totally shut off, because the updates come from another country, which is a pay 2 play server with a sub, and the maybe 150-200 people that play literally dump thousands into the gambling bottles every time they come out. I can tell you this though, it will 100 percent be shut down within the next 5 years, due to lack of players, buying the pay 2 win garbage in the cash shop.			"

												Very unique game with gameplay quality rivaling best single-player games about Age of Sail. It's japanese, and it's made with love and attention to detail unlike many Korean f2p games nowadays. Item shop does have pretty democratic prices, and around 10 bucks closer to endgame is about all you need to spend to feel comfortable - even less if you stumble upon sale or bonus code. But for those who want to empty their credit card there is sure quite some nice stuff there. It's perfectly playable for free, and 10 bucks to upgrade ship will make it even better closer to late game.I can't recommend it for everyone - this game is pretty niche, and you either love or hate it. But because of that it has great community, new publisher is working on the game and making it better (Steam launch is one of their accomplishments), and there are lot of players from NA and Europe for every time zone.

												This is a game that takes ""slow and steady wins the race"" and emphasizes the slow part. It will take you hours to even be able leave the safety of your starting sector and hundreds of hours before you can even dream of reaching the other end of the map.As of right now I've put 160 hours and I'm just about ready to explore the americas and feel confident that I would actually survive there. And I'm another 160 hours away from reaching Asia.The ship to ship combat is simple but strategic as your positioning is cruical to win a fight. Melee combat starts off extremiy simple and would at first look like the downside of the game but as you level up and get more skills it becomes too becomes something more than just a ""one button to win"" like it starts.Economy is extremily well made as each trade good has it's price determined by how much of it is sold by the players and as such bringing items further away gives you more money. There is also player economy as you can set up Bazaars to sell goods, ships or items to others and make a nice profit. Actually mid game its probably your biggest income if you know what to sell and where.Over all the game is slow but overall fun to those who enjoy exploration or economical trikery. 8/10			"

												By far one of the best MMO's I've ever played. It may be a bit challenging the first few times and you may have to make multiple characters (about 2 or 4) to get it right. Everything is geographically accurate with town in the right place AND the towns actually existed in real life. It's slightly educational with its geography and it's essentially a 16th century simulator. There's storylines depending on your character's nationality and nearly the entire world is open for you to sail to. I recommend this for anyone who has a lot of time on their hands and enjoys a casual community. Don't be afraid to ask for help from players if need be; they're almost all willing to help.			"

												This game is not only a redux of one of the best SNES games ever created, it is also a very relaxing and well-executed rendition with a solid community and nicely varied gameplay. Given that the maritime MMO is a relatively uncharted Water in an of itself, UWO:2 carves a niche all it's own and does so with class. Long Story Short, you are a sailor. Where? Why? How? You decide. In the age of Exploration, you get a boat and a world to explore at your leisure. Do you want to Adventure, searching for fame and glory? Do you want to trade and make millions? Do you want to be a pirate? Any of the above? All of the Above? This is the game for you. Buy it, trade it, steal it, produce it or customize it, all of the above of options for you. Varied battle and adventures on land and in the sea. Tonnes of ships, skills and options. The World is literally yours to explore and exploit. Enjoy! For someone who loved the original, this game is a God Send.			"

												This game is a hidden jewel that is worth trying out maybe for some may not be for some others.<---I am going to repeat this at the end.This game is really low maintenance and doesnt require much effort to put in...BUT this game eats up time. I start this game at 7 AM and then its 2 PM when I look at the clock again. Its pretty much sailing managing your ship, some low intensive combat. Decent graphics. The game is sort of slow but it is quite fun. It will take lots of time. I really enjoyed playing this. There are lots of friendly people in this game as well. The fun part is getting more money. Watching your cash go up is satisfying and profiting. The music is really really nice. I fell in love with the BGM in this game. The sunsets and sunrises in this game is spot on. Its like a beautiful water color painting. The main feature of this game is sailing. When you first start it may be a little difficult to control your ship but you get the hold of it pretty quickly. And you are suppose to adjust your ship sail to gain wind to move faster. BUT you do not need to do this anymore when you get the sail handling skill. The skills you have are important for this game. Knowing a language is a skill. Like knowing portugese, spanish, italian, etc. Knowing your languages is extremely important until you learn the body language skill which lets you talk with anyone in any language BUT it requires a lot of vigour(pretty much energy to use skills or mana?). It is cheap to restore vigour. Each skill is extremely useful in its own way, and there is a limit so you have to choose which ones to keep or throw away. The tutorial in this game is what they call the school. There are three level Beginner intermediate and advanced. They teach you about the game. And they are different depending on what job you have: merchant, adventurer, soldier. The beginner course shows you the ropes and the basics. The intermediate shows a little more in depth of the game. And advanced course gives you the more complex portion of the game. Each time you finish a course you get rewards that are really good so it is a must to do. There is adventuring: treasure hunting and stuff like that do not really know since I started out as a merchant. And battle which is pretty much combat and everything that is combat related.You basically rely on using items to fight people on land. And for sea warfare you adjust your ship direction and shoot your cannon balls at them.I am on chapter 6 of the storyline which is pretty much the 6th quest in the main quest series at the beginning. I am emjoying it so far. There are mission requests which are pretty much quests are at the guild where your job is based at. These are good to do helps build up fame and exp for the skill. THIS GAME IS SORTA REALLY AMAZING AND YOU SHOULD TRY IT OUT. It may not be something thrilling and heart pumping but it a game really worth your time to try out.			"

												I would say this game is great, specifically adventureing and trading as I havn't done much maritime yet (though I plan to with my next new ship :P). It has a very slow calming atmosphere which is really diffrent from a lot of other mmo's. The tutorial litterally takes forever (me and my friends clocked about an hour each) which can be a huge turn off for some people, however ocne you get out of the tutorial your free to do pretty much whatever you want. you have a huge selection of skills which are ""expert"", ""favoured"" and ""unfavoured"". expert and favoured can go to rank 16 which means if your job has them, you can be the very best at them. However you can make any combination of skills to create your own custom class withen the professions. trader with guns :D! explorers who can buy lots of animals :D! Battle ships that can cure the plague and fend of rats :D! anything that you can think of, the game will let you do. Almost every job is profitable and there really arn't any downsides to sticking to even a starter job, or switching jobs all the time. TLDR; Do what you want, When you Want, How you want it :P			"

												I came to this game last year, after learning that Pirates Online had been taken offline at my.. short stay.. in a ""place"" with no internet. It's an interesting game definitely, with many people to befriend, and many quests to go on. My only advice, as one who has played this game for a bit, is don't try to start off as a Pirate or as anything Maritime for that matter. Get a nice trader up and running, get Asia opened, make profit. You'll often find a shipbuilder that's training and making more ships than he can sell, who may give you a deal on one of his lower-than-average ships. You'll also find ships for nothing in shops, as well as be given very powerful ships through the tutorials and schools. It takes a while to get into, and the land combat is a bit boring, but once you can take to the sea and start the real conflict, it gets interesting. My only regret is that I started out on Steam and spent so many hours, then tried to make free money using surveys. Damed be them, they weren't prepared for this. You can only take surveys if you have an OGPlanet account, and signing up on Steam dun't give you one. "

												Great concept. To me, not enough by way of some of the tutorials. Pointing out the goal is in another town would be more helpful than letting you wander in circles asking what you did wrong. In other words, read the text. Every tiny word. I say tiny because even on it's larger settings, the text is very small to my old eyes. In fact, that is the only reason I'm not going to play anymore anytime soon. The game is enjoyable and well worth the asking price. Give it a shot if you like sailing games with or without trading.			"

												I would recomend this game a thousand times to anyone that I could. Since I've been playing, I've already put 600 hours into this game, and trust me if I didn't like it, I wouldn't still be playing it. It's got wonderful, old style graphics, with a unique story line for each nation you can be a part of. Each of the three classes (adventure, trade, maritime) have their own unique ways to play. There is almost an endless amount of things you can do, the grinds are long so be prepared to invest a lot of time into the game. The community can be very helpfull to it's new players as well, so if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask! *keeping this short!*			"

												Uncharted Waters is the only game I have come back to again and again after WoW lost me. Naval combat is awesome and the world map is our own world map, albeit a few hundred years back in terms of country and town names. Its free to play but if you grind and acquire gold you can buy almost all the items people buy with cash. The best ships in the game are able to be bought by players who have not spent a cent in game but have grinded cash with time spent. Discover NANBAN trade and you are on your way to being a rich powerful player in game. Even if you are not it is thoroughly enjoyable. You can be banned for the standard transgressions and  I have seen a few people get butthurt over bans that they say were for 'nothing' that were in fact for flagrant breeches of the Terms of Use. Try it its an excellent game. Older player base than many games I have played and I even played with a 90+ year old who as a young man was a crewman on a Tall Ship and so loved this game for the experience and reminescence(if that is a word - if not it ought to be) that it gave him. Seriously - try it - the school system though a little boring supplies you with free ships (and each next section an upgrade) that are OP for starters so do not bypass this unless you own an alt who can sugardaddy you to the same sort of powerful shipping. Piracy has been nerfed (my only gripe), but for a new player youre immune to player pirates till you have one level to 30 and only then once you have a total of 50 or more levels . Ergo, 29/29/29 is safe but 12/30/12 is hittable. Great game - and years later and on its third owner/server - I am still there. Quoll			"

												An old established gigantic game. You can't win, can't lose, it goes on forever and you never find all the paths to follow. You play it as a long-term hobby, so most of the 100+ on-line at any time are dedicated nurds, mostly adults, more than half female, who have been playing for years. The kind of people who do the hard crosswords every day. So there's an established community. You can't really play well without friends, community help, hand-me-downs, and frequently referring to on-line forums and cribs. You'll keep notebooks and write stuff down because there's too much to remember. You'll run more than one character ('toon) because the game is so big, so deep and there are too many avenues to explore. It's like a maze, but there's no correct path, no short-cut to success and time passes slowly. You need patience. Satisfaction comes from a million little achievements, tiny hops along your chosen route, referred to as ""the grind"". Older players will help you along.You can become a pirate, or a pirate hunter, but that takes a lot of time and money. You'll only hear about them, but probably not see one, for many months into the game. You start in a nursery area between England and the Mediterranean and attend up to nine schools for tutorial lessons. You do trading, questing, producing, map-making, policing and discovering while building your skills here before being allowed out to the wider world. Then things escalate. To join the big guys you'll need to work hard, and to form a gang for self-protection with your friends. Planning you toon's life is part of the fun. There are monthly sea-battles, races and other events you can join if you want to compete with other players but these are not compulsory.I recommend this game if you have the tenacity, patience and focus to play. It's not for instant teenage solo heros. Try and join with a friend as you can help each other, share tasks, reinforce each other's skills. Lately there have been more returning players than new blood, as people come back to the game after years away. Says something about the endless quest mentality of players perhaps. Also says how good the game really is. Forget the fact that the graphics are from 15 years ago and the translations from the original japanese are sometimes enigmatic because the game is a puzzle in your head, not a video experience. It's a life-style game. Choose a life, a job, an expertise, a body, a costume - I've never seen two people dressed the same. Allow a lot of time to play, although some players can go away and cook meals with the game still running during voyages. The simple graphics means it will run on an old computer with WinXP. Serious players run up to three (max allowed) computers at the same time. Slower players can avoid any PvP action and quick reactions aren't really necessary at any time. You need to know/learn geography and navigation or you'll get lost. The world is accurately drawn, so are the sailing speeds. You get historic influences too. You can learn a lot. Try it!			"

The good:+ As a historical sailing MMORPG it has a very unique concept. Most of your playtime is spent as a ship, you only switch to the actual playing character on land :)+ Complex and diverse game mechanics, you can focus on whatever aspect of sailing you prefer (trading/exploration/battles/crafting) or any mixture of these.+ Mostly relaxing gameplay+ Nowadays the game gives a lot of free stuff to new players upon reaching various milestonesMixed:~ Very comprehensive, but also very boring tutorial~ Nice ambient music, but quickly becomes annoyingly monotonous if you stay in one city for more than a few minutesThe bad:- Worldwide PvP without opt-out. Meaning if you want to avoid all PvP you have to stick to European waters :(- The game is set in the era of colonisation, and you play as a member of one of the colonising nations.- Very aged graphics- Due to the game's complexity you pretty much need to use the online community[unchartedwaters.wikia.com] resources[unchartedwaters.olous.com] to avoid sailing back and forth among cities just to find out where you can buy/do certain things.- The only game I've ever played whose anti-cheat system doesn't tolerate Process Explorer[technet.microsoft.com] running in the background...

												There is a lot to this game.  Lots of places to explore and do.  If you want to go out and fight water battles, you can do that.  If you want to just explore and discover things, you can do that.  Be aware that when you choose a path (although can be easily changed) you should stick to doing just that.  I chose to be an adventurer and explore oceans and continents and look for shipwrecks.  Having a lot of fun and like being able to engage in ocean battles.  I don't like the fact that you cannot except more than one quest at a time, at least I can't at the moment, because I found it difficult to go out and take care of a few things at a time.  You kind of have to accept a quest and pretty much concentrate on that one quest until it's done.  I did read that you can eventually except more than one but not sure how as of yet.  Maybe a level thing?Just be aware, this is a game that has a lot to it and I do take notes on my dry erase board in order to keep things straight.  In the beginning, you will be bombarded with information during the ""teaching"" phases and it will be hard to remember everything.  I recommend not blowing through the tutorials on anything like I did for some things, because you will miss out later on in the game if you don't know who to talk to about certain things.If I have to say anything to criticize the game, I would say that I don't like the Vigor part of it.  At lower levels, you will not be able to do long voyages and fish, survey, collection, and sail handling without having to stop at every major port along the way to find food to replenish your Vigor.At lower levels, the only food that replenishes Vigor is sold in major ports inside the pubs.  In here you can buy food and drinks from the bartender to get the level up good and then purchase good to take with you to replenish it while sailing.  This just takes up time I don't have when playing and it's tedious.  You can learn cooking skills to make your own food but at my level, I don't have enough skill points to add that.This is only a minor thing and shouldn't prevent you from playing the game, i'm sure it gets better as I level.  One word of advice, use the wikia page and read the ""New player lessons learned the hard way"".  Then bookmark the page and use it as reference as you play. "

												This game is a great concept and I can see it getting better in a few years. At this moment it is alot like D&D, and RIFT were you have to drug through the beginning. It does show to be difficult to do the missions from the beginning with out a good cash flow in the bank. The 30 days at sea to gain interest on your banking should be improved for the lower levels. 1% for 7 days at sea would be good. The game has promise. the schooling at the beginning is a pain to sit through. But it is a good idea to shorten it and make it more like a mission type with great reward. Maybe learn the trades by going on mission to other ports so that you see how first hand of the supply and demand of those areas. As your player progresses it gain better income by longer hauls, bigger fleets, and discoveries. It's a good game if you can wade through the beginning.			"

I downloaded it from their main site, and I have now been playing it for some time (Enough to get my own company) I like it and it's a very in depth game. Graphic details is good and will even run on none gaming laptops. I always use my PC though, The slight down is the trust between you and you're Aide as that falls when you run out of money i.e when you're on a cruise to the company colony. As of help from the admin direct (Social Media) they just ignore you and for me as a long serving player on this game, that is damn right ignorant.Company name is: youngnetsrik_Gaming  based in: London.We are working towards the Colony just now.Hope this helps and see you in-game.

												Best MMO I ever played!!After finishing ""school"" tutorial for all three classes IS where everything starts. You having small ship sailing between couple nighbouring ports- world feels so small. BUt as you progress you unlock more of the world. It is fantastic how better ships make world smaller and smaller eventough world is getting larger.I personally like you can play as adventurer then after some time switch to being merchant or just go and battle. Grinding your skills really feels rewarding. At least it did for me. As lvl 10 sewer you make yourself some killer sails, or as cook you make food for your company or fleet. Social interaction was really what got me immersed for 2 years(2009 &2010). I strongly recommend this game. It has great setting and real world map. People are cool and helpful. If you like using wiki it will help alot. Skills are interconnected and knowledge how to get something or where to find is crucial. Everyone has a different taste but this little gem has everything I could ask from MMO's. "

Posted: January 6, 2016
												Quick summary before a point-by-point review of the good and bad.UWO is a by now 10+ year old (so expected dated graphics, design conventions et.c.) game of the age of sail. Think Sid Meier's Pirates if you're not familiar with the superior Uncharted Waters series before, but on a worldwide scale with absolutely no ballroom dancing, guaranteed. Knowledge of real world geography will help you here. It's an open-ended game, but without the common pitfalls of ""what do i do now?"" of sandbox games. It's very much ""pick your playstyle"" sort of ordeal. An explorer who wants to profit of far-away trade? A trader who carries less but knows which way to hold a sword? A bounty hunter? Mix and match freely.The largest problems in this game are;- The absurd monetization. If i understood it correctly, a few of them are normal features on the Japanese release of the game, although their version last i checked required one-time payment. The monetized items include your bank (timed 30 days), speed buffs, questionably powerful items and more.- The ""anti-hacking tool"" malware that you'll bump into if you dare to play eastern games on your PC. In earlier versions, it was possible to remove it, but it frequently causes severe issues with input device drivers, particularly Logitech seems to be the target of the people who make this. This is what caused me to quit, and it took them more than a month to fix. I'm looking to play it again soonish, however.- Selectively poor design. In a nutshell, everything that you do on foot is poorly designed. Your mileage varies, but generally if you do go explorer, i'd advise against explorers who specialize in land missions (Biology, largely Archaelogy, et.c.) and instead choose Cartography and the likes.- Massive overinflation causing overtly screwed up economy due to money-gouging translation company (the previous one, though this current one isn't less gougey). Seriously, if you play normally with minimal player interaction, a million is a lot of money. If you trade with players for bog-standard dime a dozen items, 200-400k per item of a certain type is extremely cheap. It really needs a total reboot, or better yet, a remake.- If your goal is ""max level now"", forget it. That obsession will give you nothing but grind here.- Exposition-heavy tutorial with extremely janky sections. Blah blah blah, get on with it!- Questionable sensation of queasiness over the inclusion of child-like characters. If you can get over the sight in games like FFXIV-2 or TERA, you're fine here too. Personally, i cringe at the sight. Thankfully, the game does provide a button (escape, amusingly enough) to simply fade away all player characters. Blissful.Now, i firmly believe the good outweigh the bad.- Open class choices. Despite the game handing you out a starting class, you're more than free to change your job (trader,  warrior, explorer) at any time to any of the class-subtypes you have learned(i'm trying to keep the review brief-ish, so not explaining those here). The painful, drawn out tutorial does offer you more ""class slips"", and some players are fine with doing the tutorial (school) for them, and admittedly, the rewards are nice, but i prefer other ways of obtaining them.- Open progression. Each class comes with a tree. You're free to- and encouraged to mix and match the trees. Traders learn body language, for instance, which most all people probably get. Adventurers are more likely to learn the actual languages instead, especially languages which they need to read up libraries for discovery information.- Highly varied playstyles. Explorers, traders and warriors each play highly differently. Explorers don't largely care about mobs/mooks and more often than not outrun them if ambushed, traders fear the pirates deeply, and soldiers/warriors go in all cannons blazing. Explorers, well, spend their time exploring. Traders spend their time trading and applying their craft and trade, and soldiers do what you'd expect them to.- Non-AFK style sailing. Finally, instead of boring ""oh, i guess i'll get a cup of coffee and entertain myself with an entertaining game while pretending to enjoy this other game i'm waiting on"" that you see in so many games ranging from EvE(Low- and nullsec nonwithstanding, of course) to Elite, you need to respond to waves and changing winds in different manners depending on your sails, the ship, your abilities and so on. Of course, there's a skill to help you with this, but you still need to keep an eye on the game, steer your ship and so forth.- Considerable differences between water areas. You'll face different winds, different challenges and generally are encouraged to use different styles of ships for the different areas of the game. Mediterranian is an inland sea embraced by land, so you don't really have strong waves or strong winds, and even when you do, the winds are often blowing from the atlantic or northward, so moving westward would be commonly painful... Yet here, you're given the option of rowable ships, which you'll also see in the arabian sea later in the game. There are other flavors, like the huge waves and powerful winds in the atlantic, or wildly twisting winds of the pacific, but i'm struggling to keep this brief.- Generally really well done and thought out progression. While being the ultimate goal, reaching the maximum level or potential isn't your immediate desire or need. There's fun and (relatively, see hyperinflation) profitable activities to do from the moment you hop onto your ship. I never felt like i was in a rush of reaching the top level, and... despite clocking in 340 hours, i'm still not there, and i can certainly say i enjoyed most of those hours.- Magnificient soundtrack that cannot be praised too much. My ears have never been so pleased by consistent beauty. Each music piece in this oozes the thematics of the area or the nation you're in. Go check them out in google. Marseilles' theme brings to mind france, food, culture, snobbish, hro hro hro. While Oxford's theme is venerable, if slightly bombastic. Amsterdam is more easygoing, and London is very royal and quite reserved. The moment you hit africa's ocean the first time and that tune hits you, it's just chills all the way. There is no music here that stands out in good, or bad.Have a sample:

												Overpowered starting items take what little challenge there is out of the already dull and reptative gameplay.Xtrap anticheat conflicts with Sandboxie, most security software and a mix of other widly used applications preventing you from playing the game while those applications are running.

												This game isn't your average mmo where you hit lvl cap after hours of grinding then you just hit the pvp arena. It has so much to offer in terms of guild activities and trading. This game is fun those money minded people that want to see how much they put in the bank. Not only that but the questing (although boring in the beginning) is really a lot of fun. I'd recommend this game to those that are inspired by people like Marco Polo and all those other famous explorers. I gave this game 50 hours and by the end I loved it. Maybe this is the type of game that clicks only to a few people but I'd say give it a shot.			"

												Best MMO I ever played!!After finishing ""school"" tutorial for all three classes IS where everything starts. You having small ship sailing between couple nighbouring ports- world feels so small. BUt as you progress you unlock more of the world. It is fantastic how better ships make world smaller and smaller eventough world is getting larger.I personally like you can play as adventurer then after some time switch to being merchant or just go and battle. Grinding your skills really feels rewarding. At least it did for me. As lvl 10 sewer you make yourself some killer sails, or as cook you make food for your company or fleet. Social interaction was really what got me immersed for 2 years(2009 &2010). I strongly recommend this game. It has great setting and real world map. People are cool and helpful. If you like using wiki it will help alot. Skills are interconnected and knowledge how to get something or where to find is crucial. Everyone has a different taste but this little gem has everything I could ask from MMO's. "

												I love the fact you can play three ways or all three ways if you want or dont play those three at all and just kill people in pvp battle. But the school thing is too much. Thats where I feel the game loses alot of players. There needs to be a thing when you start to simply by pass the school system. And the idea of shipping from here to there and needing permits is just limiting. And drives me crazy...But beyong all that, it's got alot of life and play-abilty. The Community is always helpful.

												This game is a real diamond in the rough. While graphically it's not the most amazing game I've ever played, it is certainly the most addictive. The possibilities are endless and the depth is amazing. Make money as a trader by taking specialty goods to faraway lands, braving pirate infested waters to do so. Or develop one of many production skills and sell products, equipment, ship parts, or build ships to sell to other players.Trade isn't your thing? Hit the seas in search of adventure then. Embark on thousands of gripping quests, brave dungeons in search of treasure, or discover new wonders in remote areas of the world.If neither of those ""Float your boat"", train to become one of the world's best naval commanders. You can almost taste the salt and sulfur in the air during the Epic Sea Feud, a multinational battle event held each month. Fight in a large scale battle for territory, forming an aliance with other nations to assert your military dominance over the opposition. The winners will increase the influence of their nation, and the losers will find themselves to have less influence in the world.Perhaps you are more prone to a darker way of life? Terrorize traders and plunder their booty as a pirate! Or become a bounty hunter, seeking out those who loot and pillage and keeping the seas safe for everyone!The game has so much to offer and is truly remarkable for a F2P RPG. Hundreds of ships are available, each with unique stats and skills that you can select when you build them. Events for players of all nations are held frequently, and the game's community is quite welcoming for new players, featuring ""schools"" for each class to teach the basics and provide new ships and rewards for new players. Come join our adventures as we celebrate a more civilized age in Uncharted Waters Online!			"

												Even though my profile says I have played for 15 minute, I had actually played this game for years - yet I still have a lot of things to be discovered - indicates that how many things (being repetitive) they have put in.In the beginning, it was an almost perfect game in its genre - Adventurer skills gathering items (for production purposes, and discovers equipment that helps other 2 classes) and improves efficiency of their ships.Merchants skills enable them to purchase bulk amount of rare goods from places 2 hours (real time) apart from their motherland and sell them back for vast amounts of wealth so they can support their countries financially (mainly investing other ports for new selling products and fame) - despite the fact that they can be attacked by pirates (PKers) and have their good confiscated - hence it is essential to plan your trading route to avoid them.Millitary skills characterise battleships player should be using, and it is the 1 of the 3  PvP events where most people participated in - either a officer class that is expert on using their ship cannons, or a pirate class that is expert on deck combat and robbing other people.There are many jobs available in this game, even though it will not stops you from what you want to do (i.e. a merchant with a proper customize merchant ship can still do some NPC warfare) - but of course you will have a lower experience point gained, certain skill level limited, and requirements doubled.It is the end game job classes that will differentiate distinctively to each other, but until then you are free to change your job at your needs (and it is always in an advantage to start your character as an adventure learner - my personal tip.)In the past, ships were played differently due to their sizes (small gunboat battle plays different than the large 1st class Vaisseau due to its different maneuverbility) and galleys classes navel battle can beat frigates and galleons with their superior deck combat ability. The ingame economy was reasonable so that a new player back then can have less pressure on chasing up veterans, and this perfect harmony works until they implemented the east asia patch (El Oriente)El Oriente literally f**ked up the whole game by trying to - address issue that had haunted the game for years, and to put unnecessary crap that does not really need address with.The remarkable thing that had haunted the game while I was playing - was the RMT issue where full time, multiple account holders selling their vast amount of ingame currency with real money - I believed were attempted to be resolved by exchanging goods instead of bulk purchasing them, and those Asian product were sold 20 times more than a normal spice trade, depsite of the hardship of getting there in the first place, new players are now facing a huge gap against veteran players and yet have to deal with a f**ked up, highly inflated ingame economy.2nd thing they have f**ked up is the ship balances by implementing extra fire power to small and midsize ships -  so since then their naval battle are bunch of boring cannon fest, and because of their introduction of customisation of the ships, now all ship class plays indifferently, the only 3 ship you really need is gunboat, Caravelle and Vaisseau, where otherships are a joke and played by masochists.3rd thing is to introduce p2w items to resolve piracy issues ingame because dumb, but rich ingame merchant players were campaigning pk issues in official forums that concerns the development team to do something about it, so that merchant player can p*sses those pirate players off and make them quit - so they can enjoy alt-tabbing in game.And the last con in this game is you need 2-3 partner for pretty much everything, from making items, building ship, and mass bomb investment to your archrival's port, so this either bring more friends to dedicate their lives with you, or find a way to play 5 clients at the same time.When I arrived in its overseas server 4 years ago (due to that great tsunami + earthquake that literally closes down the server temporary) I found that only event winning prizes itemss are in the cash shop, which literally stops me from playing it further on - despite their level requirement for certain ships is much lower than its orginal counterpart.However, even including the greatest♥♥♥♥♥♥ups from Koei Tecmo, this game is STILL THE BEST GAME in terms of simulating the age of discovery, and it is quite an educational software for studying World history via actually discovering them (which Koei were proposed to do for this game) ingame.And the ingame community are still yet needed to be growing via getting more new players in.Therefore in conclusion, if you love and intrested in age of discovery life and history, while perhaps you just lost your job and yet to look for one (or student that have vast amount of holiday to spend), and finally if you don't mind graphics that aged 10+ years old, this is the perfect game that the industry can offer to you.

												In my 5th year of UWO gaming now.You probably wonder what somone still finds amusing in a video game after so long.Well for one the game is really deep. Regardless if you advneture merchandise or maritime mostly, you always need to do your homework on the online databases.Researching what to do is part of the game, by that i mean reading others opinions online on what ship skill to inherit, or how to pull off an adveture quest chain, or how to produce a given part, or where to gather the materials for that part and what skills it requires, are just a few things you may need to look up.Another aspect is that you can do many different things during the same day of gameplay.You can start your day with a nanban merchant run to rake in a few hundred millions of ducats, that you later spend on producing cannons and armour some of which you sell in a bazaar while keeping the great success ones. Afterwards you decide to change to an adventure job and thus you pull a few shipwrecks and pick up some quests along with the research thesis to compliment them. Just as you had about enough of your daily dose of adventure you head to the daily feature pvp.Since it's not the start of the month and there is no Epic Sea Feud, you argue with your friends about what to do next: mock battle, join the Battle Campaign, Bounty Hunt, or even pirate some unsuspecting merchant. At the end of the day you enjoy a little of Seville or London and chat with friends while playing poker or dueling. The majority of the playerbase is somewhat mature. This intelligent yet fun playerbase, adds to the depth and variety of the things to do in the game and that way you don't get bored of a repetitive and tedious gamplay.			"

												I think I logged a few more hours than I intended to playing the game this week --- In fact I didn't even log off, I got booted off because they are doing 2 hour maintenance. What a great time to write a review! I really enjoy playing this game. Very in-depth! At first, I logged in and did schooling, which was pretty slow but I enjoyed it. After graduating all three beginner courses (Maritime, Adventure and Trade), the school gave me a decent ship and I bought some trade goods and hit some ports and made a little profit. I fought with pirates in the Caribbean, traded everything from alcohol, rope, chicken, agate and crystals and even discovered some lost relics and statues! You can learn skills like procurement (to catch water when it's raining), fishing, ballistics, accuracy, frugality (sailors use less rations), search, sail-handling and a ton of other skills (different languages so you can communicate with vendors in foreign countries).  It's really inspiring to go to a capital like Seville and see 50 player bazaars (vendors) selling luxurious hand-made dresses and clothes. armour or EU goods, furniture for your quarters or parts for your ship. Anything...  To tell you the truth, after 130 something hours this week I only scratched the surface of this game and haven't even done one dungeon yet!! But now that the server should be up in 15 mins or so (and I learned the basics from a friend, self sailing and school) I am ready to give one a go and hopefully get some valuable loot!If you haven't tried this game out - I strongly recommend you try it... Especially being free! It can be a little slower-paced than most MMORPG's I have played (starting off with nothing and learning the essentials) but I think it is more rewarding. Trust me, once you upgrade from your Barca or small boat to a Battle Heavy Caravel and have some decent cannons and a AIDE ship (or a trading vessel if you want!) and get into the action - you'll see the hours go by. Playing this game captured a little bit of my heart and I'm looking forward to where next week will take me... Or the month after.   :-))  But rest assured, I will be grinding on GAMA...  Barina from the Netherlands.			"

												This game is a bit dated, but as we learn time and time again, they dont make them like they use to. This game is extremely deep, its original game content seems infinite. Its style is a little bit 'cheesy asian', but it works for it and the complexity is so mind blowing that you continue to learn of new skills, places, trade goods, schools, dungeons, quests, discoveries, ship wrecks, treasure maps, and so much more. The way they get away with FTP is by offering very limited storage space and EPIC TONS of loot. So if you get into the game, its like 4 bucks a month to have a bank or a strongbox. Its just a solid entertaining game and if you get turned off by the endless complaints about it, then youre missing out.			"

												Greetings, fellow gamers!Admittedly, I've stepped away from UWO for a bit, but I will say that when I am engaged...I am ENGAGED!  This game is not for the time constrained for faint of heart.  As a fan of the Koei NES versions of the game: UW and UW2, this is an excellent successor to the series.Gamer population: very helpful, with several differtent chats to choose from to seek guidance and help.  Several wiki's are available to support new gamers, or gamers that have fallen off the wagon.Personalization: one of the best aspects of this game is the ability to personalize your toon and your ship.  Want to look like certain captain from a movie/cartoon, you can!  Want to make your ship resemble historical pirate ships? Find the paint and sail and it's yours!Community content and indie adventures: Another plus.  The Game provides historical events the community and PC can participate in, which influence the game world, as well in-game non-aligned quests from quest hubs at the ports.  Random events and pirate attacks keep you on your toes as you negotiate the game mechanics.Not so good: The tutorial is PAINFUL. Long and cumbersome, but necessary, if you want to know how to do the basics.  With the availability of the wikis and the willingness of the online community to share, the burden on the player is somewhat removed.  Graphics: dated and cheesy, but it's Koei and I'm a bit sentimental, so I forgive it.  Others may not be so forgiving.Combat: the one-on-one duels can be frustrating if you don't have the right weapon/armor/tool mix to counter your enemy during boarding actions.  The land quests are fun, but can be just as frustrating.The gradual degeneration of your ships hit points: this is the most tedious aspect of the game for me.  I get a new ship,  and over the couse of voyages, encounter pirates, rival factions, storms and other randome phenomenon.  I can either fix myself or take to a pro in port.  Either way, the max HP level for my ship deteriorates.  I understand the historical truisms the game tries to maintain, but this one gets under my finger nails!By and large, this is a fun game, with lots to explore and do.  I'd say give it a spin and be willing to invest at least 20 hours to truely get a feel for it.			"

												I have not played this game through Steam, I started back when another Company had it, Netmarble.  I logged back into the game about 5 days ago after being away for over 3 years. The game is a very niche game. Older graphics but has a lot to do in it. Very grindy. The community is mostly either very new players and or alts of Vets.  Not very much in the way of team type play most people play solo with alts and the few active companies are just a few people and their alts. So if your looking to start and join in with people to play with , Don't.  They have had a turn over with some GM's that got demoted for cheating and a lot of in game scamming is going on. The game is in a bad way imo. Community is not very good and the pvp is just a joke. No risk vs reward.   I normaly don't write reviews but if your looking for a new game to play pass this one up.  Unless you like the cash shop idea type of game + being very grindy.			"

												Tutorial takes around 3 hours to finish, but when your finally done you get to go out to the sea and do quests with other people witch is tons of fun! there is also allot of grinding to get bigger ships but its a hell of allot worth it (had over 20 hours on this game.. none steam) last year in 2013 it had tons of glitches, now its fixed.. atleast the most annoying ones, keep up the good work!Class suggested highly for starters -> Trade Learneraround level 24-30 switch to whatever you want :) i suggested Trade Learner at start because you can gain the most money and buy whatever you need to set you off into a good start.

												This Game is like a Lost Gem. You spent many hours lerning the game and mastering it. And wen you finaly master it the felling is superb! Ofc this is game is Not for anyone if you a fan of mooden Fps then it might be a littel to slow for you :) but i will still say try it you might be suprise by it. if you like trade and selling and buying the this is a most game for you do not get scared by the grafiks  the Gameplay makes of for it. so what can i say other than set the sails, and lets earn some mony  or if aventure is more your style you can visit many isle sercing for lost artifacts.or you can build a grand convoy of frigates and destroy pirates.and the cloth you wear  improves you trade or politiks or combatdepends on what Class you want. So have fun Sailor			"

												I am really enjoying the game so far. One thing i feel could be improved is the tutorial in te begining. I undersatnd the school makes sence but I feel people learn better from doing wrather than reading. If you could intergrate the tutorials into more missions where your tutor takes you out on a mission and shows you there where to buy crew and everything crucial for your ship and crew. I pesonally didn't mind it but I can see some people being intimidated by it and losing intrest in the game. Apart from this, I can not really see anything that needs improving except maybe making the cities and towns you visit more exciting insted of just having the bare essentials. The idea behind the game is really fun and a welcome change from FPS action that we are bombarded with these days.			"

												My first review ever, and is a funny/complain review: I start playing this game and school chat was very helpful and respectful; when out of school chat enter the world merchant chat, my worst nightmare many disrespectful people calling idiot to others if you dont follow their guidelines a very acid community, only some few players willing to help; the game is a pay to win bussiness model, where the ships made in the game are worthless if you face the top tier of the store ones. Many people or bots in the port/city of seville, some selling and others advertising what the corners have owners?, about this one never found how to buy a piece of the land in the game I like the view from the doorkeeper so wanna make it mine and charge taxes to all the ones sitting down there. I will continue playing this game, for the moment till found something new.			"

												I only just scratched the surface (finished the basic tutorials and did a few trips), but I am enjoying the game so far.It has quite a few things that makes me remember the old days of Voyage Century Online, without the boring resource collection in AFK for hours.WARNING: It is by no mean a game that everyone will enjoy, the whole game revolves around a few gameplay points that are quite different from your normal MMO RPG.

												I rarely ever make reviews for games, and usually it's for games I absolutely love and wish for others to enjoy too. So pains me when I have to make a bad review like this.As you can probably see above this post, I have 0.4hours of play time. Got to be wondering how I could be making a bad review when I haven't even played the game for long right? The answer, is because I haven't even gotten into the game yet.I can not make an account, it just does not work. And there is no help with that, either here on Steam or on the Official Forums. What's more, this isn't even a NEW problem. This has been something that has plagued the game for years it seems. One of many problems.Welp, one of the 'great' 'work arrounds' they have for it, is to download the game through their website and play it through them and not through steam. <-- I am not making that up. It's in the top sticky thread of the Game's Steam Discussions.Top thread that is Stickied and named ""Solutions to general technical Issues"" One of their 'Solutions' is:""7. All else fails, you can download OGP Launcher and register a new OGP account with a new email and play directly through the publisher.""The funny thing, is that UNDER that little 'work around' is this:""You can try helpdesk for other issues, but register an OGP account to submit ticket""^ That one, I want you to pay attention to. Cause you see, after 3 days of trying, searching, and scraping together answers on what to do. I decided to follow troubleshoot number 7, and just go through the publisher to play the game. So I went to the site. Clicked to Register a OGP Account. Put in my Email, Username, and Passward. And... Error. Can't use a Yahoo email? Oh. Well ok, I hate Gmail, but I have one for Youtube. Put in the new Email, do the little 'slide the bar' to continue and.... What the heck?""It appears that your IP(Notgoingtogiveitout) has been blocked. To find out why, please send us a Help Desk ticket with your Error Code (10005) and we will respond within 48 hours.""Welp, you could be saying, Just make a Help Desk ticket to get it sorted out. But you see, there is a few problems with that. First, is that I never been on the site before till that point to make an account. So how on earth could I be IP Blocked on a site I've never even been to before?But more than that. Remember that thing I told you to Remember?""You can try helpdesk for other issues, but register an OGP account to submit ticket""""but register an OGP account to submit ticket""""register an OGP account""I'm IP Blocked it says, when I tried to Register an account to play the game through the Publisher... How can I make an Account. To get Help for being IP Blocked for no reason on a site I never been to before. When being IP Blocked mains I can't register an account in the first place.Can't make an account to play through Steam. IP Blocked instantly when I try to make an Account to play through the Publisher. And if you just go to the forums, both on Steam and the Offical Forums you'll find thousands of posts about crashes, bugs, Account Errors, and many other things that make the game unplayable. And have been happening for YEARS, and they have NEVER fixed ANY of them over the years.It makes me sad to say, but I have to ask for you reader to STAY AWAY from this game. There is only hair pulling, hours wasted, madness and frustration. And that's just to get INTO the game, a game where the average player can only play about 30-50 minutes before the Anti-cheat system the game uses either Crashes just the game, or for some people will crash your entire computer.

												Edit: Managed to get it working again (somehow), so I'm changing the review.UWO is very different from your average MMO, in no small part due to the majority of the game revolving around sailing the world and exploring, trading, or both. Upon starting, you're asked to pick a starting job from 3 choices: Adventurer (exploration), Trader (mercantile) and Battle (soldier). Each job has it's own skill set, and you're able to change jobs as you progress, so you're not just tied down to the one you pick at the beginning.Sailing itself is rather easy once you get the hang of it, which shouldn't take very long. The main threat when at sea is other players. Around the starting areas of Europe, you're relatively safe as long as you can deal with or avoid NPC pirates. But in other regions of the world, the titular uncharted waters, other vessles are free to attack you. Thankfully the world is a big place so encounters shouldn't be too often, plus you can group up with friends and have them help you out in a fight. Operating a merchant vessle and concerned about hostile ships? Bring along a soldier buddy to watch your back as you make trade runs.Overall the game is very fun to play. Points lost for the use of GameGuard, but hopefully that shouldn't be too much of a problem for many players.			"

												This is an amazing game . . . As long as you have the patience for it. It takes a while for you to get rank, but that is one of the great things about this game. The time required prevents the younger community from playing this for lack of patience. So the community in the game is pretty good. The animation is a little bad, but the game is free to play so why should they have the best animation out there? I don't have any real complaints about this game and I reccomend it to anyone who has patience and likes sailing.			"

												where to begin. ship movement and battles are some of the worst ive seen in a game. the school at the start takes soooo long to tell you 1 thing going back and forth and some of the end exam quests say dont worry well give you an item so u dont need this skill for the quest only to have to need anotehr skill at the end part of the exam but your across the map from where you can get the skill because you where not told you needed it from the start. sitting still anchor out days still go by, any cities including starting cities youll be attacked a sunk by groups of 2-3 pirates some you cant see it will jsut say ""ambush"" an you in your starter ship trying to just do they school missions to teach you about the game getting sunk. the map when sailing is garbage does not show where you are so you will have to guess.its not all bad the graphics for such a game are fine not every game needs to be the top best animtaion. the world looked fine the cities where fine even character models where good. the set up for missions and many of the game mechanics seem fine. mostly all the small and inbetween stuff is done well just some of the major parts of the game are to painful to go through. overall the game is very boring an most any other ship game is better even if theres no multiplayer.

												The game was just plain boring... unless you like running around selling stuff to practice your buy low and sell high skills. i was hoping for more of a Age of Pirates 2 feel but it falls a bit short of that for enjoyment.over all game play was just ok like a 6 out of 10.  was never any lag so that was good. traveling around the main map couldhave been made better.over all game was a 6 / 10.  free enough to not bored you to death but not buggy as most			"

												             Just short of 300 hours into this now and these are my impressions so far. Overall, I find the game enjoyable and even somewhat addictive. There's a great deal to do and many different paths to take to do it. While I can tell there is a consensus ""best"" way to get lots of money and the best equipment as soon as possible, I haven't felt forced into that play style to enjoy the game. I also haven't felt that the P2W element is very prevalent though that may come into play more as you progress. Actually for me the best part so far is that it's an MMO that you can easily play almost like a single player game if you wish. There's also plenty of opportunity for interaction with other players if you wish.               And that's where the major fault in the game lies as far as I'm concerned. The community is pretty much divided into new players mostly from the recent addition of UWO on Steam and people who have been playing for years. I'm sure this isn't a unique problem in MMOs. The experienced p[layers almost always are willing to answer game related questions but certainly have their established cliques and often dominate chat with personal feuds and erudite conversations that are more confusing to new players than anything else. Unfortunately the game's moderation at the moment seems to consist solely of fellow players who rarely intervene(and sometimes even participate) in the drama unless it involves chasing gold scammers. My advice would be to use the school chat while you are getting familiar with the basics and then turn off WC unless you need the entertainment. There are at least two helpful wikis available that can help with most questions you are likely to have and they don't engage in two plus hour name calling contests.			"

												This is a classic never ending MMORPG. You start out in school learning the basics of sailing, trading and combat and can choose any career path you want Adventuring, Trading, Combat (PVE or PVP) or a combination of all.Sounds good and for a while you'll enjoy it but then you find you've done everything you wanted to in a skill or field and have to move on to another skill or job or go insane with boredom, there is no point staying as an expert at something. Adventuring has huge scope with many different things to do, but unfortunately you will end up doing the same quests, hunting the same relics and raising the same shipwrecks over and over and over again.Trading is again fine at the start, if you choose to stay F2P you'll grind your way up the skills buying and selling everything you can for profit until you make it to East Asia to trade. Buy dirt cheap get back to eurpoe and sell items for a huge profit to NPC's or to other players for an even huger profit, but once you've done it a few dozen times its pales quickly.Combat in the game comes in two types, land or sea. Land combat is possibly the worst you will see in any modern MMO or possibly any game ever made, it is unbelieveable bad. The sea combat is better with fully buildable and modable ships it can be fun but again the missions are extremely limited and just attacking random NPC's hour after hour is amazingly boring.PVP Combat is the way most people go before quitting. You use the fortune you've amassed to buy a NC (cash shop real money) ship that has been modded with NC items go to a busy trading area (most areas in the game outside europe are PVP) and attack people in trading ships. They know you are coming so leave all ther money and good items in the bank leaving you just thier cargo to steal (you can't take thier ships or even items equipped on thier ships atm). The only problem is that thier cargo is bought in the area you are patrolling so is basically worthless unless you transport it yourself and your crew heavy combat ship uses all its cargo space for food to feed your sailors. So you sit there attacking people who don't fight back, mabye you like that kind of thing, I don't.Crafting is around par with the average MMO, grind you way up different skills (cooking for instance) until you get to rank 10, you then need to take a specialised job in that skill to get your rank higher. If you change your job you keep any xp you have gained in the skill but it can only be used at rank 10 until you take a specialised job again. Irritating as hell.The UI is abysmal. Every time the Devs add something to the game it is added to a drop down menu with no help or explanation as to what it is. The initial training in school is OK as long as you rmember it has been transated from Japanese by someone with poor english and there are huge errors, one instructor has his title translated three different ways, one above his head, one from his own mouth and one in the quest log. you haven't a clue whats going on. The mainline quests are even worse, you can be stuck in the middle of nowhere with no idea what to do next.I'm making it sound bad, I know. I played UWO for a few years as something different to my normal kind of game (DDO, LOTRO, SWTOR) before getting bored. I went back and lasted a month before dropping it again. I'm 2 weeks back into it and again bored, it seems to have reached its limit for me.If you are looking for a way to kill a couple of years without focus then try this. Almost everything in the game takes a LOOONG time so it can eat up empty days you have easily. The guides are all dreadful or translated from the games original Japanese release badly so you can spend hours trying to find even the simplest of information.There are a few good things about the game but they aren't game based. Most of the people in the game are friendly, it seems to be an entry level MMO and many haven't honed thier trolling skills yet. As the game has no real direction setting yourself personal goals and hitting them is also good.This is definately a pay-to-win game. OGP the people running it are money mad, you can buy anything and everything in the cash shop except accounts, look hard enough on the web and you can find them up for sale everywhere though. The account-email verification link is broken.I'm sitting here writing this as the game is down, again, OGP have been getting DDOS attacks lately. Everything they have is currently offline, a few days after they took everything down to 'fix the problem'. Nothing written on the facebook page and in fact nothing anywhere. OGP is definately a company where cash comes first, then thats it, no second or third. Players/customers have no input or say in anything.So my verdict on the game is simple, if you have never played an MMO of this type before give it a go. You will like its MMO freedom and the other players. Then when you are stuck (about 15 minutes in) go to a grown up game of this type like EVE. No rules, no direction and even though its P2P (a monthly pack in UWO is around 4 times the cost of a month in EVE), have a good first month and you can legally use in game money to pay for the game.If you have played MMO's of this type before then stay away, far away. It can suck you in as all games can and as you're a good player you can get over all the bad points but in two years time you'll find you've just wasted two years.Go to EVE, it costs but a lot less than this will, believe me I remember my bills. rant over.....

												Well i have to say after about 10 hours of gameplay i have now completed the tutorial... well the first 2 parts and have another coming up so... yeah there's that.Honestly i put a no on this review but i honestly don't know whether i can recomend it or not the tutorial is way too slow and can be very boring but whenever i wasn't doing the tutorial i was actually kinda having some fun and seeing the potential of this game. This game is great if you like in depth trading systems or long dialog based adventure puzzle (more dialog than adventure) but the game take so long to get into, you really have to force yourself to play the first 5 hours of the game before it picks up and then the game tells you there is a second tutorial you have to do and now 10 hours in i have been told i have to go to a third tutorial.Not the greatest review i know but i consider this less of a review but more as a warning; great content awaits those who can push through a really bad tutorial.I think i will continue to play this game in the hopes that the game mechanics i like flourish but because of an awful tutorial  i don't think i can recomend this game to anyone.10 HOURS and i havent completed the tutorial WHAT THE F### *Head splosion*			"

Although this game is VERY SLOW, VERY ADDICTIVE, and the controls are TOO SIMPLE! There are sea battles and land battles. How do they work? Oh, thats easy just equip the most expensive cannon or sword you can find equip it. Click on the enemy and watch a poorly coriagraphed ONE DIMENSIONAL battle that you have NO CONTROL over, except for when your healthbar gets low, then you can click on a medicine button, how exciting is that!

												I had nothing but problems with this game.  I'll admit, I never actually got to do any ship battle or anything, though.First, I had a previously existing account with the web site behind Uncharted, so it wouldn't let me create an account using the same email.  I ended up deleting the Steam files and reinstalling it from the web site.Then, I got to sit through what seemed like ages of meaningless dialogue that was supposed to teach me how to play.  If there had been EXAMPLES or any kind of visual I could follow, it might have been worth something.  I got frustrated and uninstalled before I finished the ""tutorial.""Finally, this game does not appear to support left-handed players.  Ordinarily, this wouldn't phase me much, but my usual tool for dealing with this issue, Autohotkey, is not allowed by the ""anti-cheating"" software they force you to install.    This might actually be decent game, but I wasn't patient enough to put up with all the early-MMO-era player handling and GUI strategies to get to the actual game.			"

												its been 2 hours, im not even 1 third of my way through the boring tutorial and the combat is turn based. and the game acts like its much larger than it is. When I saw the game I was expecting Face Of Mankind (the game isnt very good but you can do whatever you want) but instead its your standard run of the mill turn based MMORPG except instead of humans in a explorable world you are tiny boats in nothing but blue.sadly dissapointed :(			"

												The game caused a full Windows 8.1 reboot. Windows did not know what happened. Windows did the updated blue-screen of death and did a reboot. This happened twice. I uninstalled the program.The word was, nProtect may have conflicted with my antivirus. Their suggestion, disable the antivirus. I'm running ZoneAlarm Pro, not the free version. This was happening, conflicting with antivirus programs, a couple years ago. If the programmers cannot troubleshoot an issue with programs that all users on the internet have to be running to insure security, they do not need my business.			"

												Do NOT install this game. In order to run it requires an internet connection (which is fine, so do lots of games here) but it also requires you to disable your anti-virus software unless you are running AVAST, which seems to be the only one it is compatible with. So they want you to be hooked up to the internet with your AV disabled. I would never dream of doing anything quite so stupid. The reason, apparently, is that they have an anti-hack untility which isn't compatible with most AV programs, particularly AVG. I would suggest that they should fix the problem with the anti-hack program rather than recommend that thier players leave themselves defenceless against any old virus attack.It's a shame because I am told it's a great game, but until they address this issue I wouldstrongly recommend that you don't install the game. Unless you have AVAST, of course!			"

												this is just my opnion about this game, i played it a years ago before it was on steam, and it was half way decient then, but now the servers are basiclly empty shells and the graphics are in a dire need of updating, its good if your into the whole buy low/sell high kinda eco thing, but so far the best REAL PIRATE mmo ive found is POtBS (pirate of the burning seas), i've been playing that game like crazy, you can board ships, attack forts and theres lots of clans/ guild (called socitys) that are full of nice people who will gladly take on fleet roams anf help you level super fast, (one member gave me 2 free ships and 10,000 golds for free), Yes PotBS still have a very active player base and theres always people on, so give it a try!

												It was OKAY at the start, It downloaded pretty quickly, but after about half an hour, I decided to leave it. I then came back the next day and It kept coming up with an error. I tried launching for the next few days, but wouldn't work.The graphics were good, but the actual gameplay was flawed.  The tutorial takes at least an hour, and the creators seem reluctant to let you know how to play, since it took 20 mins to actually learn how to move about.The game is very complicated, and is pretty boring.I would say that if you are willing to devote hours on end to this game and are into a game with an accuired taste, go ahead, but otherwise, don't bother wasting your time!

												Honestly dont recommend the game at all.Game is pretty stale. The combat comes down to a point and click while driving your boat in circles around the other one and hoping you dont touch the edge of the area which automatically brings it to an end as a Retreat.The towns dont have much to them, and all seem pretty cookie cutter.Was hoping to customize my crew (kind of like on Star Trek Online) or explore my ship, neither features are present in this.Just seems like the game had a lot of potential that didnt get utilized. Again, the game is very much dry.			"

												In 90 minutes I still haven't finished to tutorial, and so far I've only seen about 5 minutes of actual gameplay. All the tutorial quests except one have been go here, talk to some one, read text, talk to another person, go back the the start of the quest, turn it in. Repeat for 80 more minutes.The one tutorial quest that naval combat wan't even an impressive experiance. Naval combat has clunkey controlls that fall far short of even incredibly old games like the original MS-DOS version of Sid Meirs Pirates.I made it to the final quest and found out that I had made a mistake 60 minutes earlier and I needed to go recover 'vigor' to finish the quest.There may be an awsome game here, but I haven't found it.

												Unless you like endlessly downloading corrupt files between versions 6.003 and 6.004 I'd avoid this turd(you start at 6.002 and need to get to 6.007....).  I actually take back the turd comment because it is probably highly insulting to overlooked, well meaning, hey I'm a turd what the hell do you expect from me, turds you find in everyday life.  If anti-matter can exist, then my best guess is this is anti-turd, and if this and a copy of ET from Atari 2600 ever existed on the same computer, a worm hole to hell would appear on the monitor.

												The original Uncharted Waters for Sega Genesis is an awesome RPG.  But this online 2nd age version was really hard to get into.  I was in the beginning stages of the game taking tutorials when they sent me out to sea.  And i just boated around for a half an hour looking for somewhere to dock and found nothing.  Super boring water to look at, even at the highest graphics settings.  I wanted this game to be good.  But I have Zero desire to go back and find out how to properly dock.  Also, there is a text area in the lower left hand corner of the screen where you can talk to other people in the game.  BUT, anytime I tried to type something into it, it told me that my comments were not allowed.  WELL, game designers, if I could have talked to someone and asked for help then I probably wouldn't be uninstalling the game right now.  Thanks for ruining a great game title			"

												This game is already running for a long time but still has a lot to offer.graphics might be a bit outdated but it doesnt kill the fun you can have in this game.The tutorial for the 3 main classes is done like a school system where you take classes. This is realy something you should do as it gives nice reward ships to progress futher.You are not forced to finish school. At any time you can decide what you want to do. from naval fighting to exploring dungeons for treasure. Or maybe find a sunken ship and tow it to port to explore the hull for lost treasure!Or sail for your private island to develop mines, farms fisheries and ranches and get good resources this way to process futher or sell on the market!This game is not for people who like to rush things as said in many reviews its slow. For example if you want to build cannons you have to sail to differend ports to gather the materials during this you have to keep your cargo space in mind or you end up with lots of materials but not enough room to actualy build stuff. for the larger projects you have to plan your actions.One of the most relaxing games i encountered. just put on some nice music and listen to the waves breaking on the bow of your ship while you sail to the far east :)			"

												Uncharted Waters Online is a MMO trade sim kind of game.  There are three distinct styles of gameplay you get to choose powers from to build your character.  Merchant, which involves going from port to port in your ship and carrying expensive goods between them for resell.  Combat, which involves running around and shooting at pirates for honour, glory, and lols.  FInally, there is adventure, which involves exploring land and fighting in hand to hand combat.At the start of the game, you choose a nation to be a part of.  Each one has a different starting location.  AFAIK, there is no wars, but you can raid your enemy nations without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off your home one.   You are then dropped into the capital porttown of your homeland and told to visit the accademy.  The accedemy is a 40 hour long quest line that can be ignored if you wish, but it'll teach you EVERYTHING about the game, so I recommend running it!If you wish to become a pirate, you have two varities of ""piracy"" to choose from.  There is Privateer, which is a pirate with honour.  You are expected to only attack enemy nations, and to protect your own merchants if possible.  There is also Pirate, where you are not allowed to EVER return to your own nation and there is only one port in the entire world that will take you (and it's hidden!)Pirates can only attack in unguarded waters.  Waters outside of Europe are unguarded, but they will become guarded in each region when a pirate is killed there.  So pirate hunters can keep waters guarded and keep their freinds safe by simply sailing around and attacking any pirate they see.Pirates and privateers can be attacked at any time for no penalty and they're basically a walking target because it'll turn their names red and yellow, respectively.I end my review with a small tip for the merchants out there who don't understand the market rates.  The percentage is the percentage of the normal cost of the item.  So if it says that wool is 90%, and the cost is 90, for instance, that means the average price is 100 and you'll get it for 10% off.  If it says that wool is 150%, then you'll pay 150 coins for it.  The arrows next to the percentages tell what the last change to the price was, up or down.  Prices change.  If a lot of people buy wool, for instance, then the percentage will JUMP up to 160%, as an example.  You'll also get bonuses for delivering specialities far away from their home.  If you take some Irish whiskey to Venice, for instance, the venice merchants will pay you a ton for it, and if you take some spice from India to London, for instance, they'll pay you a ton for it.

												I can recommend, honestly, but this game does have it's issues, if you're looking for a quick review, read this.This game is good, it has a vast trade system and amazing currency system. It's naval combat is pretty good for a free MMO game, It has a good and challenging ship cargo system, such as food, water, and ammo.It has alright story development and quests.Amazing quests on occasion and rewards for quest Now here's where the bad parts come inIt's land combat is pretty awkward and hard to grasp, plus it lacks intensity,The community is alright, but you wont get anywhere without a company.The tutorial is long and can be insanely boringThat's all I found good and bad. In my opinion however "

												After a quick reinstall with a PC restart, the game finally installed correctly plus played. So, I guess it installed system processes too, that's why you can't shut it down.I am happy to say, since I am able to play the game I once played in 2010, I recommend this game so much. The tutorials are LONG and boring, but are incredibly worth it in the end. They give you a mega jumpstart giving you free bigger ships (which are unique and very great for their level), money (I earned 90K from the beginner lessons, probably more from intermidiate and advanced). So, I recommend this game very much.			"

It can be a little difficult to get into initially however there is a school system that not only provides you with all the game information you need, but plenty of money, exp and nine free ships if you complete all courses.

												Right away you should know that this game is NOT for people who are impatient. It takes ages to get anything important done, and there is a LOT of grinding.That may sound like a negative, but really, this game makes grinding fun in oddly satisfying ways.You can choose from three main professions: adventurer, merchant or soldier (although you can do all three on the same character if you want, nothing's stopping you). The tutorial is very long, but only because there are a LOT of mechanics to this game that you need to know about before you set sail onto the open ocean. The complexity of this game's mechanics may discourage players who don't want a game that requires them to think about 15 different things at once. If you want a simple, low-effort game, this isn't for you at all.BUT if you are okay with that, what you'll get is an MMO with an absolutely enormous world to explore. Almost the entire Earth has been modelled in this game and unlocking/exploring the whole thing will take weeks, maybe even months out of your life that you'll likely never call wasted.Bottom line pros and cons:Pros: -Choose from six countries to represent: England, The Netherlands, France, Spain, Portugal or Venice.-An enormous game world to explore.-Exploration isn't only rewarded, it's kind of the whole point.-Absolute sandbox freedom straight from the start (although doing the tutorial is highly recommended).-Supportive and helpful community always happy to offer advice.-Fans of PVP can become pirates and hunt down defenceless merchant players in certain parts of the world.-Interesting and well-paced story.-Very educational. You'll learn a lot about history, geography, different types of ships and loads more.-The soundtrack can be very catchy and is usually very fitting to the environment.Cons:-Very grindy. The grinding isn't as monotonous as it is in some games, but a lot of your playtime will be spent grinding.-PVP is virtually unavoidable. Other players can attack you anywhere outside of Europe, and if you're not battle-oriented, you need to be on your toes at all times.-The player-run economy in this game is broken. A lot of even the most basic player-made items can be incredibly expensive.-Repairing damaged equipment and restoring a ship's maximum health can only be done using special items that are much harder to get than they should be considering how often you will need them.-The graphics, even on the highest setting, aren't anything to write home about.Overall, this game is very fun for fans of this style. This game will be appealing to those who like this sort of MMO. For those who want fast-paced games full of action, this probably isn't what you're looking for. But if you like games with large amounts of effort, thinking and detail that allow as much freedom as you want at a slow and comfortable pace, this game is definitely worth a try.8/10.			"

												I'll be damn...After 2 years leaving this game for high end graphics here and there... I'm back into this game and the MMO feeling of UWO is just unbeatable. Just wish they remake this game with the exact gameplay in better graphics considering its old age. Surprising so many people still play this. I saw the ports in Seville, London and Amsterdam crowded like real towns. Players still selling their crafted items, ships, looted items everywhere (especially near the bank & company shop). I can see newbies 2 years ago are now glowing characters showing they are the fearsome Marine or Pirate. Company (Guild) Colonies in America have turned to big towns with many items to offer back to europe. Time for another 4 hour sailing run and stack up Cheques and get to lvl 80! If you think WoW, Allods, Neverwinter, and GW2, World of Warships, World of Tanks, Counter Strike, COD,  is fun... wait till u give this game a try. Your patience and money, skill, strategy, and making friends are important. Eg: U hate being pirated and plundered in dangerous waters.. make friends with them XD. or.... some merchants and adventurers are simply mighty hard to catch coz of their skills and communication in chat. Once ur rich, you'll start enjoying helping others, make your own company, teach them the tricks of the trade. Sail together and fight big battles againts warring nations. Or compete others with ship race between Capital ports to see who are most skilled at wind routing and ship mods. You can even name a astronomical discovery by naming a moon by your dog's name now (For real). Wind, storm, ship types and modifications. So many things to consider... id say this is the true sailing game. And unbeatable if they do a remake for the graphics. Did you say cash shop? meh... I never bought any, rich kids out there sell them for ingame currency in there :)))You'll find my alt toon Abal with this steam account, see you guys ingame.

												great little game with simple graphics and tons of various content. The only downside I have noticed with this game is that it harshly favors those who buy their ships with cash (giving them a very powerful ship comparing to any you can build or make). You can eventually buy these ships from other players....but finding a way to get 10 billion or more ducats for them takes quite some time.			"

												This game is already running for a long time but still has a lot to offer.graphics might be a bit outdated but it doesnt kill the fun you can have in this game.The tutorial for the 3 main classes is done like a school system where you take classes. This is realy something you should do as it gives nice reward ships to progress futher.You are not forced to finish school. At any time you can decide what you want to do. from naval fighting to exploring dungeons for treasure. Or maybe find a sunken ship and tow it to port to explore the hull for lost treasure!Or sail for your private island to develop mines, farms fisheries and ranches and get good resources this way to process futher or sell on the market!This game is not for people who like to rush things as said in many reviews its slow. For example if you want to build cannons you have to sail to differend ports to gather the materials during this you have to keep your cargo space in mind or you end up with lots of materials but not enough room to actualy build stuff. for the larger projects you have to plan your actions.One of the most relaxing games i encountered. just put on some nice music and listen to the waves breaking on the bow of your ship while you sail to the far east :)			"

												I started playing this game as soon as it was released in North America. I have been playing it off and on since a few years ago. I'm not even close to polishing off any of the games content. You will never say you are done with the game because they continuously add content to it every month or few months.You can be an adventurer, tradesman, or a maritimer and you can switch from those classes anytime you want in the game; you are not stuck with one class your entire playthrough. For every class there are also job titles that you can be; you can switch any of these jobs anytime you want as well.The game is very in depth and it will take awhile to get started. But there's nothing like sailing the seven seas as soon as you are ready. Travel time is about where you want it from port to port. Sometimes it even takes too long honestly but it gives the game more of that realism feeling you've been wanting.  Skills are very important in this game. As a mater of fact, skills are a lot more important than your levels. A higher skill rating makes you better than the other player with a lower skill rating. Even if that other player is topped out on his levels and you are not; as long as your skills are higher the advantage goes to you. Levels are important for being able to ride certain ships, and unlocking certain quests. Skills impact every single little thing you do in the game.A lot of free to play games tell you they are free but they are really not. I'm talking about the games with addons, paid expansions, or you need to have a premium subscription to go somewhere in the game or do something in the game that a free player could not. Uncharted Waters Online content is completely free and you don't have to pay a dime. The only advantage paying gets you in UWO is clothes, ships, and consumable items. Expansions to your inventory, ship speed up, proficiency rate gaine, experience gain are other things you can pay but you don't need it because there is so much content in the game you will eventually level out everything without the help of boosters in the first place. You don't really need the expansions to your inventory because you can make as many alts as you want and store your items on them that don't fit your main character. The games content is completely free.The games community is very large and the game is gaining popularity as we speak.It is indeed a one of a kind game and I encourage anyone who loves to explore, sail the seven seas, or play for reward of playing to give it a go. Like, now.			"

												I loved UCW I and II but this game does not share the magic, unfortunately. There is no sense of exploration as most of the world is basically gated content. The actual gameplay is passable, but combat feels unrewarding and despite their efforts fiddling with the impact of trade on ports is meh. Otherwise, the textures feel washed out and bland, but the graphics are passable. There is not a lot of customization for you character, and I hope you like 'faded anime' as your theme. It feels like a weak PS2 game. Examplar of Grind.			"
