												This is a great game. Sure it's a bit quirky, but it's got so much about it to love. If you like space gaming AT ALL, give this one a shot. Seriously, I say this as an expert. ;)			"

												The game is quite good (I played it time ago), but the Steam Version crashes on landing on a planet.  Let's hope this issue is solved and it doesn't add itself to the ""forgotten old bones"" Collection. NOTE: As I comment in my May 28 posting, all the bugs were promptly solved by the developers and the Game works fine now!  :^)			"

												This is actually a pretty good game, kinda slow at the start and there is a learning curve, but if you stick with it the game is quite  enjoyable. Though one thing that can be quite a pain is that at times the story can be a little hard to follow, but the log book can save the day there. There's quite a bit of space in this game, and the landing and moving about on the planets is quite unique (and quite well done to boot)! Let me say that I am a big fan of the X series (X Beyond the Frontier, X2, X3r, X3TC & X3 AP), and while is ain't X, nor is it ment to be, the fact remains that I find this game just about as interesting and enjoyable (and in some ways more maybe even).All in all this is an interesting take on a space sim. So, if your in to that, then you just might want to give this a try.			"

												Parkan 2 tried to create a 3D space exploration game with planetery combat,space dogfights and political aspects. This is what I call a holy grail of space games if it can be done right .Unfortunetly clearly 1C did not have experience to pull this off . While all aspects of open world spacegame are present none of them are done in the right way.-Space travel and combat are very disorienting .-Ground combat is a basic shooter with few options not counting minor item customization.-Enviroments and planets look rather dull and it is hard to tell what you need to be doing.This game expects you to learn a lot of things and tutorial does not cover all of them but if you don't skip tips you should be ok .You will stumble here and there but with the game so ambitios I am not suprised that they failed to provide solid tutorial overall.  Unlike 2D Space Rangers 2 this game is striped of all the style and atmosphere that made Space Rangers great . I just don't find visual and story elements of this game enjoyable .6/10 . I don't think its a bad game but you have to be willing to learn how to play it and overlook some flaws .			"

Pros:-Open world space flight-Faction system-Own your own planets, upgrade infrastructure-Space combat and first person combat-Buy ships, customize loadouts-Lots of content-Logbook keeps a record of every interaction, helping with several smaller frustrationsCons:-Repetitive on all fronts-Bad, bad voice acting-Can't steal the ships you board =(-Dated graphics-Poor storytelling and passable plotline-Learning curveOverall: Parkan 2 is a charming little game.  It has a lot of issues.  The voice acting is abysmally bad, and the game play gets very repetitive.  Each planet has one of a few prerendered environments and some cloned base layouts.  The game is open ended, but often it just feels like running in a hamster wheel, redoing some of the exact same things over and over.  Additionally, there is a steep learning curve, and a wide array of little nitpicky aggravations that aren't worth really getting into.  Despite this, the game is fun, really really fun.  It manages to be challenging in the right ways, and comes together as a coherent whole, even if it doesn't do so with the most style.  It won't win any awards, but you won't regret playing it.Bottom Line: It's only $3.99, that's a small price for a fun game that will give you hours of fun.			"

												Very addictive game, great game concept!  Fly the galaxy in a ""ship"", land on planets and take over outposts, board ships and plunder the loot, upgradeable combat suit and ship(s).Yes, the game crashed, once, and not once since.  Easy (enough) to read displays.  Decent graphics for its time (and for most indie-level games today), wide open play, great sandbox feel (after you play awhile, it opens up).			"

												Parkan II is a 3D space simulator combined with first-person action. In the game players will get an opportunity to explore a vast universe, visit different planets, their satellites, huge space stations and immense space destroyers. Players can do this in the cockpit of a spaceship, inside a tank or just with a laser rifle in hand. Gamers will have to fight against multiple enemies in outer space, on planets' surface, inside military bases or even in the debris of some ancient civilizations.The first thing that you will immediately notice about Parkan II is that it is really quite easy on the eyes. Granted, there are titles that have engines capable of higher degrees of detail and flashier special effects, but Parkan II’s graphics have a high degree of cohesiveness overall, thanks to consistent art design. There will be a large variety of ships to choose from in Parkan II, ranging from small fighter craft, larger assault craft, freighter ships, all the way up to your capital ships. The universe of Parkan II is based on what is essentially a story-driven sandbox mode where you can follow the main storyline or wander off on your own whims and have fun that way. There are many factions in the title, and while no specifics are available, it was mentioned that doing missions for or attacking the property of a faction will raise or lower your rep with them accordingly. Parkan II effectively combines two genres into one game, and if the other features were more polished, the game would be a complete success. By themselves, the space or land combat would be disappointing, but together they produce a fairly entertaining game. Even though the missions are repetitive and the universe is not that dynamic, space adventure fans will find enough to keep them occupied in the game, especially for the lowered price.			"

												When I first started playing Parkan I had no idea what the heck was going on. I started my first mission, landed on my first planet and still didn't know what was going on. After actually reading and listening to a bit of AI that speaks to you within the game, she gave me some good pointers to go look at my mission log book. The game is pretty cool, and reminds me of Star Trek Online way before it was even a thought. Parkan goes as follows, you have a ship that can be modified in many different ways. The suit you use when you transport to worlds can also be customized and weapons changed. The game is a FPS/RPG type game where you are able to build diplomatic ties with certain factions. The gameplay itself is first person in the ship and first person on the planet. The ship controls are done with the keyboard and mouse and provides for a decently rewarding firefight. This game provides it's own unique approach to FPS/RPG. It's not FULL OUT customization on the ship and suit (colors, decals... bla bla) but shooting rockets or lazers, go ahead and go nuts choose which one you'd like to shoot. Would give it an 8 if it was substantially different but due to it's age : RATING : 6.95/10 Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C Overall  C+ "

												I've played for about an hour and thought I would post a quick review because there isn't many so far. I'm running windows 7 with a decent system and haven't had a crash yet. I haven't gotten to the open world part yet so far its been pretty much guiding me along but its been a ton of fun. The story doesn't make a lot of sense so far. The movie seems sort of confusing but I think I got most of it. The voice acting while not great is horrible either. The little messages telling you want to do and explaining the game can be vague and sometimes you will get three or four of them right in the middle of a fire fight and don't have time to read them. Thankfully they save them all so you can go back and read them. All in all it did a pretty good job of teaching me how to play it a short amount of time. If you've played freespace or anything like it you should pick up the dog fighting quick. You start out fighint some pirates and then land to secure some data from a crashed ship and get your first taste of FPS combat. So far it seems passable. Nothing new or awesome but seems to do the job. There are ports that you will be able to take over and then defend agaist pirate attacks which seems like it could be cool.Your ship seems like it will be pretty upgradable. There is atleast four different systems you can change out also four gun spots and four missile spots. You can only have one gun spot and one missile spot active at a time but can switch between them at anytime.Also they have a energy system that I remember having fun with back in the x-wing/tie fighter days. You can switch power between your systems(shields, weapons, engines, and I think the last one was sensors).Over all I've had a lot of fun so far and will keep playing. I may or may not update this review based on how lazy I feel.			"

												Consider it like a B-Movie with great action.  Sure, some of the actors cannot pronounce all the words correctly, but who cares when $#!^ is exploding!  This game's genre lending was ahead of its time when it released, so it's still enjoyable.  The feel of the space physics & music is well done.  Still. it's a bit dodgy & confusing, but aptly so seeing the immensity and sheer scale of the universe.  Not bad... prolly worth it?			"

												I used to play Parkan II a lot when I was younger. I was happy when I discovered it on Steam during a sale.Parkan II is a game in which you become a space captain with your own spaceship and a universe to explore. The world of this game is pretty impressive, there are a few galaxies (each ruled by a different clan), in which there are a few constellations, in which there are a few planetary systems with up to 7 (probably) planets (some of them own natural satellites) which are all visitable! Also you can chose from few different spaceship types. General Information:- Difficulty: medium/hard- Graphics: It's over 8 years old, but still some views (space) can be pretty impressive- Music: OK, it used to have a fancy Russian song at the begining, but It probably got removed.- Playability: a few solid hours of gameplay and side-quests (these can get boring)- Storyline: Not the best, not the worst (a few plot holes)- Bugs: Apart from some visual glitches (like planet texture going totally black) I haven't noted any bug at all.- Lenght: ~ 20 HOURS - very long- Price: Pretty decent price for such an enjoyable game, especially on saleOverall: 7/10> > When you have a spare 1 euro during a sale, I HIGHLY recommend this game for You, great time-killer < <			"

												I bought into this game based solely on it's concept. I want to love this game so much, it has, at least in theory, everything I want in a space game. Spaceships that you can walk around in, planets you can visit, multiple factions you can join, a free roaming (but sometimes limited for story reasons) sandbox universe... It even has in-ship fighting where you can get boarded by enemies or board enemy spacecraft to comandeer it yourself.The game is a few years old, and the mileage doesn't give it any compliments. It has aged, and it hasn't aged well. It most likely wasn't even very visual-heavy back when it was first released back in 2007 either. But that can be forgiven. The real problem with this game is how the awesome concept is being executed. It's executed poorly. I walk around, doing stuff, going, ""Ah, wow, this would have been cool if they had made it like that,"" or ""this is kind of amazing, I wish they had expanded on that"" etc. Also, the planets and stations feel copy pasted and empty, defeating the purpose of being able to visit them anyway.In short, though it has many features, none of them feel fleshed out, and some are flat out stupid in their lack of polish. The story isn't anything to write home about either, possibly due to poor translation and sub par voice acting. Want to spend 5-8 hours tops fooling around in a semi open sandbox space sim thingy? It's 5 Euros or your regional equivalent. Is it worth it? Your call. I bought it, played it for a bit, kinda liked it, it was average. But I left it feeling unsatisfied. I would recommend waiting for another game that does this but better.Pros:Great conceptA few hours mindless funCons:Poorly executed conceptsIt ain't no lookerFeels empty			"

												This game is enjoyable but has a steep learning and wonkiness curve. By wonkiness I mean for instance that the default control settings make it impossible to play the game. Make sure to go to the settings and click 'default' to return the controls to a playable setting.Parkan 2 is an open world hybrid game. After a fairly lengthy intro segment of the game you are set loose on the world and can do as you like. However, you are given a series of missions which push the story forward and ultimately lead to a relatively linear and singular objective. The game itself is broken down into three main parts. Space segments where you fly around and dogfight against other ships or space stations, landing segments where you fight against machinery and humanoids, and indoor segments where you fight only against humanoids. The game is much greater than the sum of its parts. The individual components of the game are all relatively mediocre, but they actually work together to create an enjoyable and engaging experience. I had a great time upgrading my ship(s) and battle suit while progressing through the game. The downside is that the game lacks any sort of exploration incentives. It may boast hundreds of sectors but by the time you've seen 10 of them you've seen all of them. The translation job on the game was also a low level of quality with incoherence and typos more the rule than the exception. This is made even more frustrating given that the story is actually quite interesting and thought provoking. In spite of its flaws it's a game that somehow will keep drawing you in for more if you can fight through the intial learning curve.			"

												Overall, the game looks good and also sounds good. Most of the game is pretty okay and even the graphics being a bit antiquade it doesn't make it worse. The voice acting is average, some is okay, some is awful, but at least you see most of them trying, so it is a good jobThe controls of the spaceship also works fine and you can control it pretty easily, although, the major flaw of this game, and also the reason that I can't recommend it, is the aim system.Once you automatically aim at them, your missiles will reach the enemy, which is ok, but your main weapon, the laser/gatling gun, won't be automatically aimed at them and you will need to manually aim at them and shoot. Which is really horrible, it is not precise, it doesn't have a good hitbox, it doesn't even show you that well if your shot was good, you can see, but it is not that good. It is awful, and it is the main objective of the game, so, not recommended because of it.If you want any more reason, well, it also tends to crash sometimes, so you'll be at risk playing this game if you don't save often.

Nothing is implemented correctly(the AI is dumb, the FPS(on land) segments are pretty dull and boring with some pretty bad controls and every planet's a cookie cutter copy of the last one) the game is vast open and completely empty(the landscape of every planet literally has not a single living being on them), and worst of all, there are no humans. Not a single human being in the game as far as I have played it other than a few cutscenes. It's just.. boring. It's like a dollar-store Elite. The voice-acting isn't good either.

												I am quite dissapointed, as this seemed to have everything I wanted in a game, but it crashes at least every 15 minutes. Also, the directional control will sometimes pull to a random direction out of nowhere, the only way to fix is to reload a save. These two bugs make the game unplayable			"

												....one of the worst ""tutorials""...had me going around in circles for hours trying to find the objective. Without a guide.... ""good luck"" there is no map, and there is no indicator telling you where to go or what to do, and the action keys seem to be mapped at random.Besides this, the voice acting is terrible, there's hardly any since of direction, there are TOO MANY keyboard inputs to keep track of and remember, the interface is TINY on higher resolutions, poorly written dialogue, and all the enemies are exactly the same droids. (no humans or aliens)Why oh why do I torture myself. >.<			"

												The Russians can be weird cats when it comes to open-world gaming.  Their strategy seems to be ""throw everything in"".  Sometimes, this works, as in the case of ""Space Rangers"" and ""The Precursors"".  In the case of Parkan 2, it doesn't.  What you get here is an open-world sci-fi thing that combines both a poor, repetitive space shooter/trader, and a really poor FPS.   Combine that with low-budget, constant asset reuse, and remarkably bad translation and voice overs (the same guy literally voices over multiple characters, and it's beyond terrible) and you have a real dog.  If you really want something like Parkan, head over to Gamer's Gate and pick up ""The Precursors"" -- while it has a similar lack of polish typical to Russian games, it is far better at doing what Parkan 2 tries to do, plus there's a community patch that fixes most of its problems.

												Far be it from me to run this into the ground. If this is their own engine, then obviously a lot of works gone into it, Its all very shiny (for the sake of it ??).I guess I was looking for some sort of No mans sky fix (before its out) landing on planets ect.. This is not that fix. Like alot of the reviewers, its hard for me to pin point one thing. The team are obviously very talented and ambitious and what an indie tech demo (circa 2004) !! but Its a case of very generic art direction.I should have trusted my gut instinct on this one. I considered getting this for WEEKSI can imagine people that like stuff like Chrome might get into this. "

												Where do I start ... The main idea of the game is good and it feels like an interesting game, but there are many problems. The game was released in 2007, but graphics looks like from ~ 2000th. First time playing game crashed after 10 minutes.Battle system is complex and poor. It is impossible to understand what to do. Plot is quite stupid also there is way to much text to read. While music and sounds are quite good, dialogues are horrible.All in all, this could have been a great space andventure game, but becouse of All these disadvatages game is not worth spending your time and money.

If you could actually skip the tutorial, I woulden't be so hard on the game but.... MAN THAT ♥♥♥♥ING TUTORIAL. I bored of free roaming after a hour. The game isn't worth, it, I luckily got it on a deal, but trust me, don't even buy this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥on a deal of 1.00$ It ain't worth it. Instead, get TF2 and buy an item on that.			"

												I get the feeling that who ever the person was that translated this game had to be drunk or have no idea how the English language is actually used. I started the game, i tried to make it past the beginning of the game and i just couldn't stop laughing or cringing! And the casual way they game tells you that your totally screwed over is just to much. Lay off the vodka lol. I'm recommending this game for the fact that i couldn't stop laughing at the poor voice acting and Engrish use, not the fact that its a great game lol			"

												This game hasn't aged well graphics-wise but the visuals are tolerable; ironically, it's the performance that makes me give it a thumbs down. To the best of my understanding, every time you board an enemy ship its interior is somehow connected to your own's and isn't properly cleared afterwards, which means after a few hours the game starts to lag while inside the player's ship and quickly gets unplayable even on reasonably powerful rigs. This glaring oversight hasn't been fixed in all those years since initial release so I wouldn't bet on them fixing it now.			"

												Great concept, poor execution... The game really tries to mix politics, space combat, shooter, colonisation, exploration and RPG together into one epic package. It actually more or less delivers in all espects - there are factions and some politics between them, you do fight in space, you can colonise planets, you do customise your ship and equipment, you can capture ships or planets in FPS game... But most of the puyyle pieces are of quite poor quality. Game was quite bugged on release, it was not possible to finish main quests. Still I do recommend a game, for a price it is quite an experience and there is definitely enjoyment worth 4 bucks in it. And you can dream of the game with the similar refreshing concept, yet much better execution.			"

												Plot is sort of convoluted, and voice acting is fairly terrible.Where it get interesting is the gameplay, though mainly a fairly good space trading sim, it allows you to board enemy ships and loot them. You can also land on bases on planets In an FPS manner. These aspect is flawed and unpolished, but manages to give this game a unique charm.As far as the technical of things is concerned, sound is average, graphics are colourful, but also average.Buy it on a sale. It'll offer you a fairly good time			"
