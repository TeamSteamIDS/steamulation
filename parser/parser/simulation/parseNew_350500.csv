												Fast Review: All in all, too expensive.Getting started with this game: DONT press play, press help.You will need to know how to move around.Once that is done, you should be ready! - Beware that the cursor is a fixed distance away from you!Things to improve:Clunky mechanics: hard to grab things, hard to throw them. Little to no explanation: It should state somewhere: DO THIS! etc. Absurd amount of points to unlock next lvl. I smashed everything I could think of and got stuck in the bathroom with 998 points (1000 to unlock next lvl).Glitches: they happen.Nice idea on paper, but there are the things above to deal with.I would love to see a renewed version of the game! -the idea is still extremely good!

												First and foremost let me save everyone a bunch of frustration: ""F"" is throw. It's not obvious. In short, it's kind of like a ♥♥♥♥♥ier, less clever, less developed Elebits. If you've played Elebits don't bother buying this, it will just make you want to play Elebits again.The bad:* Physics are wonky. Sometimes light stuff will be incredibly damaging, other times heavy items just bounce off objects doing no damage etc.* Controls suck. Sometimes you can pick♥♥♥♥♥♥up, sometimes you can. Turn to fast - launch object. Occassionally picking♥♥♥♥♥♥up will send you across the room randomly. Kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥* ♥♥♥♥ing impossible to unlock new levels. Can't even find a youtube of it.The Good:* Once you get into it, it is kind of fun throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥around trying to kill that damn fly.* There are a lot of objects and it's kind of fun trying to figure out puzzles to find hidden objects.* Clever idea, somewhat original.In the end I wish I could give it a thumbs-sideways. I mean, it's okay. It's worth the $5 or $10 I guess depending on how much you value your pocket cash.			"

												Honestly, this is a $2-3 game, not $10.  For one, there are only 3 levels.  The levels are difficult and will probably warrant multiple playthrus to pass (you have to cause enough mayhem/earn enough points and unlock achievements to progress), but I personally didn't like this approach.  I found myself playing the same level, over and over, yearning for new environments.  There are no sound sliders and the arcade mode is a just a sandbox at best, though without more content, it gets old rather quickly.  You can only throw a table out of the window so many times before it ceases to be funny (Goat Simulator suffered the same problem).  I like the idea, it just isn't executed well enough to warrant the asking price.

												Fly in the House is a poorly optimised game that can be kinda fun. Going round smashing stuff is pretty enjoyable, especially when you just forget about trying to kill the fly entirely.However the fly is almost impossible to kill on purpose, and likely to be killed by accident while trying to achieve something else, by Sod's Law.This makes the several challenges on each level that require quick, or accurate, killing of the fly, near impossible and extremely frustrating.Which would be forgivable, if you could just ignore them.However the worst part of the game is the way you progress.To progress to the next area, you need to:Kill the fly in story mode.Beat the target score.Complete Everyone one of those impossible challenges (kill the fly in a Super Fast time, kill multiple flies in X time, hit the fly without breaking Anything else in the level)Find Most of the objects in the level.Find most of the achievements in the level.I might have even missed some of the tasks. Even just making it so you have to kill the fly, and get the (actually ridiculously high) target score would make progression actually, you know, fun. But no, you have to achieve the impossible.I've managed to unlock the second level, somehow, but unlocking the third looks to be beyond me.So no, this is not a good game.  Shoddy implementation. Super difficult Luck based challenges. And  a dire game progression system.The first I could forgive. The second I could forgive. But the third one ends up making the game just no fun at all.			"

												Developer: Mykhail KonokhPublisher: Kiss LtdSteam: Fly in the HouseJust one thing to note. I as a reviewer. Have never been a fan of calling something utter crap. If you watch my YouTube channel you already know this about me. I think everyone has a dream or vision. Whatever you want to call it. Who am I to say that it is utter crap. I don't know how to program a game nor go about any means of marketing it. My stand point comes completely from that of a consumer. Nonetheless though I can see where something works and something doesn't. So I will be fair but try to keep a positive attitude. You can expect me to point out problems or what I believe to be mistakes. With that in mind. Fly in the House is what I like to call a chaos game. The basic idea is that there is a fly, wait for it, in the house. You must smash it by any and all means necessary. How? By apparently taking it out on IKEA furniture. You will fling chairs, TV's, tables, you name it. You throw it. Along with the basic gameplay there is some other game modes thrown into the mix. From using only a flashlight to find your prey. To Fast destruction mode.Sounds fun enough right? For the most part. Sure. Given its price tag of $9.99 though I have some issues. I can accept the games simple nature. However Fly in the house is a one trick pony. After you seen the trick, you either laugh or don't. That's it. The end of show. Throwing furniture around a house at a glowing ball of fly can only be spun so many ways before the concept becomes repetitive. This is mostly due to the way the game progresses. Which is through repeating the levels over and over again. Every level has a set of goals or things that must be done to get to the next level. Some of them are easy and some of them can get slightly annoying. What this ends up becoming is repeating content. This isn't how you keep me excited about a game. The same environments no matter how loaded with little secrets becomes dull.So why not skip the level? You can't. You have to play that level until the next one is unlocked. To be quite honest, I never even made it past the first level. There is so many silly requirements. I got tired of seeing the same level over and over. Speaking of the level. The graphics are actually not that bad.It looks pleasant enough to the eye. Also just about everything is smash-able. Which is entertaining. The first time. Plates shatter, statues crunch, and even the roof can come in. Which the fly can escape through much to my chagrin. Everything feels like it has the weight of the object. Followed by the usual crashing noise of that object being thrown out a window or bursting into flames. As far other details go like story, soundtrack. They aren't really a prominent aspect in the game. Its all about that stupid fly.Controlling the game is weird subject. At one point the cursor would move through objects you could pick up. Making it impossible to tell where that cursor was. This was patched out thank god and made the game a little bit more friendly to picking things up. However strange things like objects flying out of your hands cause you turn the camera too fast. Do and will occur still. I don't know if this was done on purpose or a design flaw.Another issue with the game was the lack of options. Now I am not a graphics Nazi or anything like that. Some options would've been nice though. You got mouse sensitivity and anisotropic filtering. No rebindable keys, no resolution control. It is what it is. Then again, should I have been really expecting that much? Probably not.To its credit. I think Fly in the House is a family friendly game. Just about anybody can pick up and play this game and get a basic idea of what to do. If all the levels were unlocked from go. I think I would've had a much more pleasant time completing all the hidden goals, exploring, and smashing all the levels Sadly this isn't the case.Also they dropped the ball on something that could've added a really neat element to this type of game. Mutliplayer. Split screen local co-op could've added a layer of complexity and fun to the simple nature of the game. Smashing things alone is fun. Smashing things with friends? Way more fun. Adding a strange death match mode where one has to protect their fly and kill their enemies. Could add some much needed fresh ideas and change of pace. While still using everything in the game. Also give this game some replayability that isn't demanded and shoved down your throat.I know my criticism sounds a bit harsh. I did enjoy the idea of the game. I think with a little bit more tinkering and way more content. This could've been a great game. In its current state though. It simply is lacking.To wrap up the point in fly paper and move along. I would only recommend this game if you really, really know what your buying. Aside from reading this review. Go watch a video of someone playing it. If you think you will enjoy that first level. Replaying it for atleast a good hour. Now after all that and you're still sure you want the game. Wait for a sale. Now go ahead and buy the game. Why? Simply because there is already some amazing games in the $5 to $10 range. That probably will give you a bit more then Fly in the House does.			"

												Fly in the House is a silly physics game built around... as you might have guessed... killing a fly. Contrary to its name, you do not always kill a fly in a house. There are other unlockable levels including an office and a castle interior.The Good PREMISE - Fun, funny and ridiculous, throwing stuff around to kill a fly is a lot of fun EASTER EGGS - Achievements and findable ""easter egg"" objects encourage exploration.. and smashing stuff to find loot. STORY - Or lack thereof. The creator of the game has passed off some semblance of a story. Each level starts with the protoagonist recollecting some important moment of his life, retelling the story in his head, before becoming distracted by a fly buzzing around. To my surprise, it does actually lead somewhere.The Bad DIFFICULTY - Some stages can be really frustratingly hard. Part of the problem is the lack of any kind of savegame. For example, if you need to kill X flies in Y seconds, and you get all of them but one, you need to start the section over. GRAPHICS - Lets be honest, it doesn't have to be a masterpiece. But the graphics in this game are very VERY basic. I'd say that's just fine except for one thing - it actually slows down my incredibly beefy gaming PC. This seems to happen a lot more when I've thrown a lot of stuff out the window. Just an observation. This is not the type of game where I would expect any kind of performance pitfalls, but it does have them. INACCURATE HITBOXES - This is a rather large problem in a game designed around throwing things to kill a fly. It might sound like I'm compensating for my inability to hit said fly, but I do have proof. On the Castle level, on the second floor landing next to the staircase, walk towards the column right next to the railing. What happens? For me, I walk up into the ceiling, as if the hitbox for the level has a staircase there. But the level does not have one. Any attempt to throw objects in and around this empty space will hit some invisibile obstacle. I think the problem exists elsewhere too, but never so obvious. FULL COMPLETIONISM IS REQUIRED - To advance to the next level, you must complete the main quest, discover all the hidden items, beat all of the challenges, and get all of the achievements. Thankfully they have them all listed-out, but I think this is overkill. Can't we just do like 75% of them? And what's the point of achievements and easter eggs if we must find them to continue? COULD USE SOME MORE LEVELS - Only 3 levels seems short, even if they are made longer by the addition of challenges and easter eggs.ConclusionIn the end, despite having been horribly frustrated by this game, and being made crazy-angry by it at times, I must recommend this game. Its not some amazing gem, but it is pretty fun, especially when you're just playing it casually. However, once you are done goofing around and try to actually get through the levels, it does get a bit grindy and frustrating, mostly because of the difficulty. I give this game 6/10, with a recommend to buy when it is under $8Thanks for reading!			"

												I do recommend this game, but be warned you will find it hard to find all the bits, but just take the time to find them all. I have found all but one Item out of the enitre game and one I can't seem to get at all. Real pain that is.But the idea of the game is fun, you can destroy and smash everything in the levels for that time of frustration or mood when you just wanna destroy stuff.killing the actual fly can get very frustrating cause the lil b***ard seems to dodge quite well, but you need to complete every thing on the left side of the progress screen first before you advance to the next level.Finding everything on the right side of the progress screen is like a side mission, you can if you want or have OCD on that sort of thing like me lol. You'll find some hidden items are either strange or hidden in quite odd and weird places, like the dumbells and duck in the first level lol.Over all, grab this game for fun and don't expect anything massive from it, just a bit of destructive fun!! good stuff			"

On the other hand the game is not worth the price, $10 is not what its worth. If you want to spend $10 on it then fine you can do that your money but i got it for 50% off and i love it and i feel good about the buy due to not having spent money on a game that in my opinion, was not worth the money.

												Full video review to come in time, but for now lemme summarize:...How do you mess up a game that's pretty much ALL ABOUT destroying stuff for fun?The premise of this game is great and it's fun to smash and break things, but two of the three levels are locked from the start and can only be unlocked by completing the most frustrating and vaguely-defined objectives that I've ever had the displeasure of attempting to accomplish in a piece of interactive media. This is supposed to be a game that lets you relieve your frustrations, and instead it does the exact opposite.In short: This game manages to take something as simple and enjoyable as the act of causing wanton destruction, and completely RUINS it.

												I bought this a while ago, tried running it on a basic PC...crashed at game startup. So I assumed it's designed for really beefy PCs, so I waited till I got my gaming PC. Installed it, ran it, ""Blender has stopped working."" then the game just crashes entirely. And by the time I had got my PC, guess what?  It had already been over a month. No refunds.  I cri ;-;			"

Review originally posted at Apoch's Metal Review[www.apochs.net].Fly in the House is an independent First Person Shooter style Action Simulator by developer EmkeyGame (Mykhail Konokh), who was responsible for 2014's Inside the Gear. Unlike that physics-based puzzler, this new outing finds you doing what we all find to be one of the most frustrating events in our lives: Killing a fly that somehow got inside. It's a small game that has been picked up by KISS Ltd. for digital distribution in March of this year. But is this follow-up outing worth the price, or is it far more infuriating than the real thing happens to be?First of all, yes, there is a bit of a story to Fly in the House. You just came back from travelling abroad to an empty home. As you reminisce and realize how long its been since you have seen any sort of family, you are interrupted by the obnoxious buzzing of a fly that somehow followed you indoors. What else is there to do but kill it and wreck the apartment in the process? This story is essentially fleshed out across the three stages, the later two being in an office and a castle. Along with your interrupted thoughts, you are given a decent Metallica-esque score that helps amp up your adrenaline a bit in order to keep you destroying or on the hunt for the winged ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ spawn of Satan that continues to elude the projectiles that are your personal belongings and décor.There are three different locations to explore and destroy throughout the course of Fly in the House. The last two, however, are locked from the start. In order to access these new stages, you need to complete a number of objectives during the level prior. Many of these are just hitting a specific score or killing a certain number of flies. Other than that, there are some mystery objectives you need to earn. One such mission is to unlock the ""Rockstar"" goal by throwing your television out the window in the first stage, as well as finding hidden objects in each level. The latter of these are a lot easier to find while in Free Play mode thanks to the lack of a timer and fly to distract you.And, really, the latter two objectives is where the game actually excels over its core concept. Taking your time to go on a scavenger hunt or just do random things in the restrictive sandbox stages does encourage you to explore the levels more than just race from one destructive object to the next in order to kill the fly that never sits the hell down long enough for you to try to kill it within the allotted length of time. In a way, it's soothing and adds a casual element to something that would better suit the more hardcore First Person Shooter gamers that might be interested in this title. Of course, just running around destroying everything to rack up points is always a plus, but those two types of game play are met by a few very detrimental flaws.One of the most frustrating elements of Fly in the House is the lack of consideration to physics other than what you can pick up. Given the developer's previous game, this is the most shocking downfall of the game. A pillow from a couch can cause as much damage as throwing a bottle, lamp, stereo speaker, chair, table, or even a television to name some of the lighter heavyweight objects you're able to toss around gleefully. While it aids in trying to kill the fly and earn as many points as possible, it'd be nice to have a little variety in damage ratios, even in a common sense way, between certain objects, thus allowing another layer to the game and possibly increase playability.This isn't to say that all logic and science is flawed. Thankfully there is an obvious restriction on what you can pick up on throw. While everything seems to do about the same amount of damage, you're not going to be able to pick up obviously overweight items like a refrigerator or couch, let alone use them as flying weapons of mass destruction. At best, you will need to desatroy these things and hope that you can still use the debris, which, in most cases, you are.The other problems are not so scientific, as they are a break in the system. On many occasions I found that, after doing enough damage, the game would not pick anything up, even if it wasn't touched or broken in the first place. This is probably some break in the code somewhere, but it does leave you either restarting the level, or sitting there waiting for the stage to end so all you've done is counted towards the objectives. The other gripes are merely cosmetic decisions that don't quite work out. If you move your mouse fast enough, any object you're holding will automatically be thrown in the direction you made the camera turn to, not to mention the key to throw said object is set to ""f"", which would have been better suited to the ""E"" key, or even the right mouse button that seems to serve no purpose. There's also no auto-lock, so those accustomed to Halo-style targeting will definitely be let down a bit. Yes, it would destroy the point of the game, but considering there is an option to highlight said fly, it'd be nice to have a choice of difficulty that might impose some restrictions as far as how to progress further for the sake of automatically locking onto a target, and removing those options at a harder difficulty for those striving for realism.There isn't anything much else to say about this game, really. One moment you're hunting a fly, the next you're tearing the roof down for a ball or destroying the walls to get to the plunger that somehow found its way into the pipes. It's an interesting game that, pending skill and amount of time you sink into it, can keep the player invested for a decent amount of time, but not quite worth the full ten dollars (US) that is being asked for it on Steam. If you see this go on sale for a decent price, even half off, and enjoy silly games like the Goat Simulator or Ampu-Tea crossed with the visual aesthetics of Half-Life, then Fly in the House is something worth checking out.Overall Score: 6/10			"

												I've been looking for a game like this for awhile now.  To me, Fly In the House, while the premise is to hunt for the fly in 3 levels, is ideally a stress-relieving game.  So yeah, hunting for the fly becomes very frustrating after a time (especially in the Office level in Lamps setting.  The fly will escape the office and will not reset), but take to Free Mode and just throw everything everywhere to vent out your frustration, until you feel better.  Love the concept of this game, and I hope more levels will be implemented in the near future.10 dollars does seem a bit pricey for what you get in this game, yet if there's going to be more levels and the controls get slightly tuned in updates I believe its an ok game for what you get.Verdict: 8/10			"
