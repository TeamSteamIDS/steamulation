												Loved this game, got all the ships and most of the achievements, but after beating it on highest difficulty in Advanced mode, can't bring myself to replay it for one reason alone: I will never get a win against the boss like that again. All but one crew member had died, my ship was boarded by the enemy, my last crew member was mind controlled, every room had a breach, oxygen was gone, and all remaining power was diverted to the single weapon firing on auomatic that was being destroyed by my last, dying crewmember, which would also be enough to finish my ship off. Just before it broke, my crew member came back under my control, long enough to allow the weapon to fire one last time. My missle hit half a second before the rebel flagship salvo slammed into my ship. It was enough. My ship and the rebel flag both exploded simultaneously as the credits of victory started up. I can't top that. Ever.			"

Dark Souls came home drunk again. It was the third time this week. By now The Oregon Trail had grown used to such tumultuous behavior, even on a nightly basis. He stumbled through the doorway hollering about some curse of the undead. The Oregon Trail, keen on diffusing such situations, offered Dark Souls a place on the bed and a glass of estus. ""Would you like something to eat?"" she asked. ""We took down a bison today."" He shook his head and took her hand. ""You are so beautiful. Did you know that?"" The Oregon Trail blushed. After all these years he still had his charms about him. ""The first flame may be dying, but I want you to know that your flame is always lit in my heart."" She caressed his face. There was no denying that he was a one-of-a-kind gaming experience. His atmosphere, striking; his storytelling, excellent; not to mention his combat, addictive and unique. The Oregon Trail blew out the candle and pressed SPACE BAR to continue. Nine months later FTL was born.			"

												There's nothing like the feeling when a game which wasn't even on your radar comes along, completely blows you away and reminds you why you love this hobby very dearly. And that's paramount. Even the best of us lose our faith sometimes. Faster Than Light is one of those games that comes out of nowhere and makes you a believer again. It is a testament to the brilliance of design over budget and as such is a shining beacon of this medium.In Faster Than Light, the player takes on the role of a starship captain whose singular goal is to defend the Federation from a rebel threat. The concept is simple, you have to make it through seven grueling sectors to face the mammoth rebel flagship which will mercilessly put your nerves and skill to the test. It employs tough but fair school of design in which you will dearly pay for every single mistake you make, no matter how small. You may not even realize your mistake until it is too late.You start with a barebones crew and equipment which you'll want to heavily upgrade by the time you reach the end. You'll achieve that by travelling through the galaxy, doing quests, fighting or aiding other ships or just buying whatever you can afford. This is a roguelike so every playthrough is completely different with randomized quests and loot drops. Sometimes you may feel slighted by the item drops or the difficult situations you find yourself in, but almost every piece of equipment is useful in some way and there's almost always a way out of a sticky situation. Being a roguelike also means that if you die, you have to start all over again. The sense of urgency is further heightened by the oncoming rebel fleet which won't allow you to roam the galaxy however you wish. Absolutely everything in Faster Than Light is subject to careful forethought and planning, otherwise you might just back yourself into a corner.As the ship's captain, it is your duty to take care of absolutely everything that goes on your ship, the design is meticulously detailed. You have absolute control over a variety of systems including engines, shields, weapons, medbay, oxygen supply, helm, sensors, even doors. You also control every single crewmember. There are different races in the game and each specializes in a certain trait (except for humans). For example, Engis repair damaged systems faster, the Rock are immune to fire whereas the Mantis are great for ship intruders.This all might sound overwhelming and there's actually a lot more various nuances to talk about here, but the tutorial is fantastic and you'll get the hang of the game quickly. This is a classic case of easy to learn, difficult to master.The universe in Faster Than Light is pretty basic, it borrows liberally from various other sci-fi sources. Nevertheless, it is expertly put together. It is a very believable universe in which you'll learn about what's going on mostly through direct gameplay when interacting with other races and factions.The Advanced Edition adds more content to the game most notably a new race with a new ship, fantastic new weapons and new upgrades such as mind control, cloning bay and hacking. The completely free expansion fleshes out the universe even further, but much more importantly it adds a myriad of new combinations of tactics that are at your disposal.Faster Than Light is an exceptional work of game design. Its biggest accomplishment, which so few games manage to pull off, is that it draws you in, hooks you and never lets go. It is extremely addictive, even when you lose horribly and quit the game, all it takes is a few seconds and you're thinking about what you could've done differently and what tactics you will use next time you fire it up. And then you click play. Again.10 OUT OF 10 (MASTERPIECE)			"

												An amazing spectacle for the avid strategy gamer. FTL: Faster Than Light is a beautifully crafted, well-written space strategy game that consistently builds on it's gameplay, and writing. It constantly gives you a feel of tension and suspense as you fight off rebel reinforcements with your last missile while opening your airlock to extinguish fires, then sending your alien mantis-like crew members to attack oncoming pirate boarders. It gets you thinking and on your toes all the time and I would definitely recommend this awesome space strategy to anyone. 9.5/10			"

												One of the most fun little games I have played in a long time. Frustrating in places, and yet always an entertaining journey.The game has a massive random element to it, and even on normal difficulty can be frustratingly hard. You will need to play well AND get lucky, but the feeling you get when you finally beat the game with each cruiser is hard to describe ... relief and epic joy would be the best way to sum it up.Worth every penny, but be warned: This game can be addictive and you may lose a few nights sleep as you lose track of time and say 'Just one more sector' ....

												FTL plays like a top down game - You control the ship through a map by jumping from point to point. Each point triggers an event, combat events involve managing the crew to man the battlestations - do spot repairs - quell fires - and whatnot. Many tactics are available, and with the release of the additional content of the advanced edition there is plenty of playstyles to explore, add to that the unlockable ships and you got quite a nice experience. The game is stable, the music is effective and it really has a memorable gameplay. Permadeath will make each decision much more critical. There is a bit of a learning curve at first but once you grasp the basics - which is not too hard at all - its very very fun. Worth the full asking price any day.Tags : Tactical - Space Crew Sim*HALL OF FAME*EDIT : 09/26/2016 Adding my Tags to review in case I lose my categories... again...			"

												Being an avid Civilization fan, a friend of mine recommended this...game.I started off on a week night about 8pm. I had to work the next day, but found myself playing this....game....until 4am.After spending >100 hours (it’s sad, I admit) on this game, you start realising little things:If you destroy a system, its ‘hit points’ is at zero. But if you cause a hull breach, you can effectively make a system’s hit points go below zero (since you have to repair breaches before you can repair a system). Therefore, destroying a system and then nuking it with heavy lasers (killing the crew trying to repair it, and causing hull breaches) is still effective!You become a lot better the more you play. Now, I win about 1/4 games on normal. In the beginning, I played about 30 times before winning a game. Long story short – FTL is a work of art. It deserves a spot in the Louvre. It is an amazing rogue like game with some excellent programming. I haven’t found one bug, nor has the game ever crashed.These programmers deserve an Nobel prize for this game. Well done. "

 FTL: Faster Than Light  was my summer in Paris, if Paris was actually Somalia and summer was hot enough to melt my face off. And you want to know something about my trip? I loved every second of it.FTL is a sci-fi lover's (like myself) dream. Filled with references here and homages there, it never slows down, the action is always frantic yet methodical, and it's an absolute delight.FTL is a Real-Time Strategy game (with a turn-based element). You control a ship and its crew from an over-head, side on perspective. There is no movement of ship to control beyond jumping from beacon to beacon.When it comes time to fight your first ship (probably in the tutorial, seriously, do the tutorial), you can pause time by pressing the space-bar, to assess your options and your tactics, in a similar way to that of games like  Dragon Age: Origins  or  The Bureau: XCOM Declassified.  You must make sure at all times that your crew are alive and your hull (your health meter) isn't about to reach zero, or it's game-over. This is easier said than done, because the amount of micro-management is ENDLESS, to the point where it is all micro-management and there isn't any priority management, per say. You need to make sure you have enough power to all systems, no intruders are going to come on board, that you are doing damage to their ship, and if not, charging your FTL jump (your ""I NEED TO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!"" button), among countless other things.This game is  BRUTAL.  There are 3 difficulties (if you use the Advanced Edition, a major free DLC added to the game in 2014, you can still use the Vanilla version that was the original release): Easy, Normal, and Hard. The only real difference between them is how long you can hold out before being smashed. You need to get through 8 sectors and 1 final boss to complete a run (and subsequently, the game). The final boss is so hard, that even nearly 70 hours into the game (at the time of this review), I STILL haven't beaten it... even on easy.And yet, despite this massive, massively overwhelming difficulty, I wouldn't have this game any other way. Because without it, this game would have FAR less replay ability. But with it, each new run feels completely different. New tactics you might need to try, new ship purchases in hope of finding that Magnum Opus that is your favourite weapon, new dialogues, everything. Without this difficulty, all that wouldn't matter, because after beating it, you would feel less compelled to try differently, and get bored a lot quicker, something I am only realizing after so many hours.Everything this game does should be a set example for games in future years. It gets everything right, the customization, the balance of every factor, excitement. Even it's techno music (I just hurt the souls of many electronic music fans), something I don't particularly enjoy, is absolutely fantastic in this game. To put all this into perspective, I got my Dad to play this game, and even he has since clocked 30+ hours of his own time in the game.So with my melted face from my time in the Somalian weather, I must insist everyone who considers themselves an open (to all games) gamer, to play this game. It helps new players find their feet, then punches them down when they have the hang of it. It screams in the face of master strategists and sends them cowering. It is one of the most soul-destroying, exciting, charming, addictive, challenging, fun games out there. It's the best Strategy game I have ever played.PROS: +Good tutorial+Fun, Challenging+Good Interface, Music.+TONS of replay abilityCONS:-Your face may melt offI'm giving  FTL: Faster Than Light  9 out of 10.

												Everyone burned to death. Then everyone suffocated to death. Then, a few runs later, everyone was burned, suffocated, and blasted to death. Giant spiders ate my crew, strange monoliths evaporated them, and asteroids turned them into fine, dehydrated powders drifting through the void.Then I started getting better. I stayed away from the spiders, I vented the oxygen out of burning rooms, rather than sending a single hapless insectoid to fight the flames. And then, one glorious day, after so much blood, sweat, and tears, I destroyed the rebel flagship and won the game.That was 40 hours in. There was still much to be done. This was before Advanced Edition came out, of course, so the unlock quests were the only ways to unlock all of the ships. And how long did it take me to obtain the Crystal Cruiser? 100 more hours.That brings us to the present day, when I'm 450 hours in, and still banging out a game every week or two. And so, if you're still on the fence about buying FTL: Faster Than Light, ask yourself this: do you want a game that you'll play once and never touch again, or do you want a game that still has tons of replay-value after a frankly embarassing amount of time?

TL;DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Faster than Light is a 'Space Rogue-Like' game that came into being by virtue of a Kickstarter project by Indie Developer Subset Games. It promises a starship captain experience where the player can manage both crew and ship in relative detail.PLOT (No Spoilers):The player takes the role of a Starship Captain with vital information that will help turn the tide of war in the on going conflict between the Rebels and the Federation. The player is allowed to select and manage a variety of ships, each having their own set of crew and abilities which can expand as you progress. Once again, upgrade your ship, expand your crew and try to stay alive till the very end.PROS:+ Gameplay over Graphics: - The game sports simple pixel art graphics that invokes a retro feel, and, in my opinion, suits it very well. The gameplay is what makes this game shine however and as stated in the INTRODUCTION, this game attempts to simulate a Starship captain by letting the player assign crew to man the ships internal systems, order power to be diverted to different parts of the ship, focus fire on an enemy ship's weapon systems and many many more.+ Stratigically Brutal: - Easy, Normal or Hard, all extremley unforgiving. This is a game where you need to bite down hard and take the consequences of your actions and choices like an adult, much like all 'Rogue-Like' games. You die, then you start all-over again. Learning from your mistake is part of the game's charm.+ Wide Variety of Stuff: - Good varriety of ships, weapons, and crew all of which unlocks as you progress. The unlocking system was set up to ensure that every new game will be different and provide unique experiences.+ Soundtrack: - Great soundtrack from a small indie game. Bigger game developers should learn that not every game needs orchestral pieces to make a game's music pleasing.CONS:- No ship customization: - Aside from purchasing weapon system and ship components, you won't be able to customize the ship's looks or the layout since said layout is on a preset. I would have liked to construct my own ship. - One Game Mode: - The only available game mode is the default escape scenario. It would be nice if they would add new campaigns or scenarios like, escort mission, defense campaign etc. It would definitely spice things up. A much more expansive map would also be welcome.- Crew Interaction: - Being able to talk and may be train your crew outside combat (specially if you find an empty system) would be a welcome addition. More interaction is needed like basic dialogues between the people on your ship to give it more life. It would be a statisfying feeling if you have resolved a conflict between two crew members.CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME for a great price. It's definitely not for everyone, specially people who has no patience for Rogue-Like games. This games requires 25% skill, 25% planning and 50% luck. Everytime you start a new campaign it would be a different experience from the last. The game allows most sci-fi fans to totally immerse themselves in the shoes of a Starship captain much like the heroes from the great Space Travel franchises such as Star Trek, Firefly, Babylon 5 & Battlestar Galactica.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												FTL is a unique rogue-like title: It features all the common elements of the genre such as randomly-generated events that may help or harm you, permadeath and high difficulty. What makes this one special though, is that instead of controlling a single character, you control the crew of your ship.This game puts you in control of almost everything: You order your crew to specific rooms, be it to provide your ship with a bonus, repair a broken system, patch a hull breach, fight enemy boarders or put out fires.Meanwhile you as the player has to make smart decisions which involves opening or closing airlocks to ""kill"" fires or suffocate enemy invaders, managing your reactor's power to decide what do you want operating at full, partial or no capacity at this particular moment, and figuring out which enemy system you want to try and take out with your ship's weapons.Almost everything in this game is randomly generated with very few exceptions such as your ship's starting equipment.This game also features achievements (general and ship-specific) and unlockable ships: You can have 9 different ships, each with 2 different layouts for a total of 18. They are really different in playstyle and can make your game way easier or way harder depending on your choices. This can provide you with some replayability, if you are into ""collecting"". Some ships can be really hard to find, however.The difficulty may discourage some people from playing it, but that's a fact with nearly every rogue-like. The way I see it, this is how it goes: When you start a run, there's a chance you will fail and that chance will never go away. What you can do about is use what you can find and devise good strategies to make that chance of failure as minimal as possible.The graphics and soundtrack are not ""high-tech"" but are very artistic instead. If you are a fan of pixel art and chiptune music (which you can also buy as DLC). This game delivers an incredible experience in that aspect. Not everyone likes those though, so I recommend you watch the teaser to get a feel of it if you haven't already.Finally, if there's anything bad I can say about this game is that the random encounters/events are kinda limited and you'll soon figure out the best course of action for most of them. They could use slightly more variety. A very minor complaint, in my opinion.So, if you are after a game that will provide you with a unique ""star-trek-ish"" crew/ship managing experience based on randomly generated elements, then FTL is well-worth the price for you!

A bit about the game and developers.FTL: Faster Than Light is a space simulation game developed and published by a tiny indie company that has just two members, Subset Games. Great job developers!About Gameplay.So, as I said, FTL is a space simulation game. In it your objective is to fly from one point of the galaxy to the other. You're being chased by rebels, because you've stolen something from them. I say that this game is space simulation because you need to tell your ship crew what to fix, where to go, where to put fire down, and so on and on. You also decide where will your ship shoot at your opponent.Don't let this game fool you. It looks very fun and relaxing, but it is actually quite complex! Imagine how much you have to attack next - enemy's shield, or maybe guns.. Maybe their engine so they couldn't dodge... Or maybe their medical area so their crewman can't heal - while you have to make sure that there are no hostiles on your ship, and if there are, you have to order your crewmen to kill them. Then you have to put down the fires, fix your guns, fix your shields, fix your oxygen and so on and on.Now, don't get me wrong. This game is amazing! Also, in case that your ship gets destroyed, you have to do everything from the beginning. And that is what actually makes this game hard. There are never more than just one opponent (at least I've never faced more than one!) in one battle, but it's still quite hard to beat them. There are a lot of ships and ships skins that you can unlock as you progress in the game. Sadly I don't know what is your reward for beating the game, since I've only got to the half of it after trying the game out many, many times.In the game there are a lot of other areas in which you can jump to that can actually hurt your ship. In those areas there can be either meteors, which can ""beat your ship"" to death, or you can come too close to the sun which will then make your hull get damaged, which means you can die! There are also some random planets on which you can, randomly, get more crewmen on your ship. They can all even be different races! Every race has their own bonuses, but sadly I don't know them so I can't talk too much about that.Graphic and AudioGraphically speaking, the game is very pixelish. Well of course, it's an pixel, indie game! And I have to say, it's very well done! I love the artwork, the explosions, the space, the look of ships. It's very well done. Audio is very relaxing as well. I really enjoy all of the background songs in the game.Pros, cons and final grade.Pros:- A lot of ships to unlocks (and skins!)- Very nice background pictures and audio.- Cheap!Cons:- Quite hard.Final grade:  8/10Extra info:  Get this game. You won't regret it! It's just amazing.Thank you for reading my reviews!

												Here we are, the three humans that took care of the good ol' Kestrel since the very beginning, the three Zoltans they rescued from slave traders, a rockman person saved from kidnappers and the mantis they picked up from a crash site. No turning back, everyone knows what must be done. Take down that Flagship at any cost.Spirits are low on the ship, as our weapons are really underwhelming. Just a burst laser, a better burst laser and a rocket launcher that was on the ship since... nobody knows when. The speedy detour we took around the Flagship's path to the base yeilded nothing useful but the last pieces of scrap which we put into our cloning bay, as we had nothing else to spend it on.Here it comes, with it's four giant guns pointed at us, it's powerful shields up, it's huge crew taking positions, the boarding party already teleporting, their cloak at the ready and their hacking drone already latched onto our sensors system. I fire off the mind control and all hell breaks loose.Volleys of every kind of projectile you can imagine fly towards us constantly, barrage after barrage. Soldiers pop up everywhere, blasting our reinforced doors and sabotaging our systems.I have full faith in my pilot, and he has full faith in the engine crew.I ask for an estimate dodge chance. 55%, he says, with a fearless look that gave me the courage to go on under all this crushing pressure.Volley after volley, good ol' Kestrel did maneuvers I thought were impossible, dodging most of the missiles, lasers, beams and ion blasts as our weak weapons barely got through their shields.Every volley was a heart attack. Especially that missile launcher. The missiles that hit punched holes in our hull, draining it of oxygen, set the rooms ablaze and made the whole structure seem like it would collapse and shatter into hundreds of pieces at any second.My crew valiantly fought all the fires and fixed every piece of electronics, as best as they could. My mind control caused chaos on the Flagship, and I could see it through the sensors when the hacking drone had to cool down, but even then, that ship was terrifyingly powerful. It was really disheartening to see the damage repaired while the hacking drone made mind control impossible as designating targets was not possible without our sensors, and the enemy ship cloaked.Yet we kept fighting. Bit by bit, we tore piece by piece off of it. Punched every little hole, one by one. Every last enemy soldier boarding our ship was suffocated mercilessly, and survivors that came crawling in were kicked while they were down.A final missile dislodged a huge chunk of it, and it looked like it was done.We could not be more wrong.The ship was just damaged, and it managed to emergency FTL jump away. I cursed everything. I had serious thoughts of jumping out of the airlock to end all this unbearable suffering. But then my pilot called me up on the comms.""So, let's finish this, eh? That hunk'o'junk hasn't seen all we got to offer yet!""Fifty five percent dodge chance. Five lasers and a missile. Fifty five percent.We can do this. I hope.We quickly pulled back to patch up the few holes we had left and to let the oxygen generator refill our ship, almost starved from the vital gas by all the breaches, and got ready for round two.The first round was just the tip of the iceberg, and true hell had only begun.Even with a huge chunk missing, and with it one of it's signature cannons, it was not any weaker. In fact, it only became tougher after reinforcements beamed into it and it deployed it's drone system.Drones swarmed us, shooting up the shields, breaching our hull and running around destroying everything. These drones were tough. They would literally punch a hole in one of our outer walls, enter a room and begin trashing it. No oxygen. Even our toughest crewmembers needed to team up on one to stand the slighest chance of taking them down. It would be all quickly over if not for the cloning bay. But what truly amazed me, was their resolve.These were people that died up to a dozen times within just a few minutes.They would throw themselves at the terrifying robots, just holding their breath, and take them down with their own corpses if necessary. I could not have asked for a more valiant crew, nor I deserved to.But as the bloody territory war was fought inside our ship, a war of attrition with no clear winner was happening on the outside. Their defense drones would render our lowly missile launcher useless, and our lasers needed a perfect volley to simply scratch their hull.Meanwhile, the barrages went on. Fifty five percent dodge. My pilot is doing his job. Maybe he's scared. I'm sure we all are. But he doesn't show it. Oftentimes I feel he is holding the ship and all us together, preventing us from snapping and giving up. But there is no time to delve into these things when the mind control is recharged and awaits it's target.We keep on going, our ship, good ol' Kestrel, starting to give in to all the stray shots and holes the breaching drones are making. My screen light up with warnings. It is hard to breathe, really hard. We can barely keep ourselves supplied.The Flagship is not giving in. All we've done is superficial damage.An explosion and a warning brings grim news. Our oxygen generator room is breached, and the drone is already breaking down the door to the backup battery. Two good men, or, rather, a man and a woman's sacrifice drops the scary robot.Close to passing out from the lack of oxygen, I give order to repair the generator.""Just hold your breath... alright?""The ship is in utter chaos. Everyone is leaving their pot and doing side jobs and emergency maintenance more than their real jobs. After the two newly-appointed engineers collapse on the floor, the oxygen is fixed, and we can all breathe again... sort of. Though there are more breaches to fix, and more drones coming in.I start having my doubts, and angrily fire our surplus missiles at their defense drone fruitlessly, just out of rage.But then it happens.A lucky laser hit a sensitive control board. Or a munitions box. Or... who cares. Their engine room was set ablaze, and I seized the chance to mind control the operator. With the improved abilities the mind control gave them, they fended off their allies until the fire was so big it was out of control. Their engines were down. They could not dodge. This was the miracle we needed.All of our lasers focused their shields system. Four shield layers, five shots. It was easy with a stationary target. After a few volleys their shield went down. With a nice fire to go with it. A final mind control took the lives of every last operator in the ship, besides the weapons specialists in their sealed main cannon chambers. The Flagship was ablaze, and their drone control system soon went down. With no defense drones or engines, even our humble weapons made quick work of it.But it had one last trick up it's sleeve. A last bail-out FTL jump. We healed the heavily wounded and took positions. We are ready.It comes back. It looks... not very threatening. It's main cannons motly disabled, no crew to repair the damages... The fire was put out, but... my mind control didn't go through. Something was up with their shields. Even our missiles collided with them.I give the order and our weapons keep firing at them. And then it happens. A power surge warning.A power surge? But, their drone system is destroyed beyond repair, and their main cannons are barely functional, what could it be, I asked myself.As if answering my question, the biggest laser volley I've ever seen lit up the emptiness of space. I could not even count how many there were. Too many. But, somehow, our pilot dodges most of them. Leaving the shields to do their jobs.After it's shields went down, the Flagship's fate was sealed.We all cheered, victorious.I will always admire you, Will.55% dodge/10 "

												Faster than Light is an awesome top down, real time strategy, star ship simulator. Its fun, challenging, diverse and random. There are some real difficulty spikes that lead me to believe that its a dead end and impossible to beat that specific random challenge. But that's what random is. This is one of the only games that I sank time into and it was fun doing it.You are tasked with traveling through the galaxy, visiting sectors along the way. Each sector is like a game map with several locations. When you enter a sector, you see all the locations as dots on your star map. From there you need to plot a course in your mind to the exit of the sector. Each one of the locations is a gamble, will they have an enemy ship? Maybe a friendly ship? Perhaps a quest that will ask you to visit a different location on the map. It is all random. There are ship upgrades that will let you see various things on the map like where hostile ships are or if its a dangerous location.At its core, FTL is a real time strategy game with a pause.  For the most part you'll be fighting other ships, one on one. This is where the real thrill comes in for me. A game of chess. Weapons will power over time and you can fire them one by one, or save up all your weapons to use them all at once. Its all point and click with a few hot keys. The combat feels relaxing, fun and engaging with some tense moments, like having to fight next to a sun, hoping the flames don't burn your ship from the inside out, but its never stressful.The ship's hull is its health. Even if a crew constantly repairs everything you damage, they can't repair the hull without visiting a store to replenish it. To get to the hull, you need to get through the shields. Torpedoes can go through the shield but cost you a torpedo. Beam weapons won't affect the shield at all. Lasers will damage the shield, but unless the shield room itself gets damaged, the shields merely regenerate. There are ion weapons that temporarily disable rooms or shields. You can teleport over a party, but if the ship gets destroyed or escapes, your crew will be lost!  The teleporter has a cool down after its used. They're stuck on the ship until the teleporter is ready again.Each ship is different, even if it looks the same on the outside, the rooms and weapons are different. Most ships have bridges, engines, shields and weapons. There are other rooms like oxygen, medbays to heal, cloaking to ensure enemies can't shoot you, teleporters to take a ship from the inside, oxygen, sensors, droid room and even a door mechanism room. Systems that all require power from the reactor. A free update for the game ""advanced edition,"" added so many new rooms with new tactics and strategies. A mind control room that you can mind control the enemy crew. Hacking that breaks a room on an enemy ship over and over again while locking the doors of the room to ensure no one can get in or out. A clone bay that revives crew when they've died.The game forces you to mix up your strategies. Sometimes you'll fly into a nebula that will drain your reactor power, so you'll have to chose what you want active. How long can your crew survive without oxygen, because you need more power to your shields, engines or weapons? Its up to you and it feels so good to have the choice and the variety.When you explore too leisurely visiting every location the fleet might catch up. You're always being perused and the enemy fleet will progress like a wave to catch you. Their ships are overpowered. You can survive the first ship or two, but the ships will always be at your next location if you let their wave of progress overtake you. The only way to reset the wave is to exit the sector and visit a new sector. You can slow the progress of the wave by visiting locations in nebula and other things that can slow the wave. This ensures that you never feel overpowered, but it doesn't hinder your exploration.You have a limited crew and your ship has areas that get damaged, so you send the crew to repair those areas. If your engines get taken out you can't move. If your oxygen room gets taken out everyone on your ship will die. Holes get punctured in your hull from breaching weapons that you need to fix. Fires that start will spread from room to room. You can either have your people extinguish them OR you can open up the exterior doors of your ship and suck out all the O2. Enemies can then take out your door controls where you can't open or close your doors. These aren't just tactics that enemies use against you, these are your own tactics. Everything is balanced. Ships are just as sturdy as yours unless you're on easy difficulty.You can purchase or find weapons from destroyed ships or in random events. The weapons have a lot of diversity. Missiles and bombs go through enemy shields. Lasers can damage shields and rooms. Various types of beams can't damage shields, only rooms and crew. Ion weapons disable room systems. Shoot the shield to disable the shield temporarily. Shoot the engine room to disable their engines. Every weapon has a different recharge rate so you need to time your attacks. There are also robot drones that have weapons too and swarm around your ship or the enemies. There is a lot of play diversity and different strategies for every ship.You'll find plenty of alien races and learn how to deal with them all. Not just that, but you'll have them aboard your ship. The slug race is slow, weak, but has the ability to perceive what is in the rooms around them or see in nebula, so you won't need sensors. The Rockmen have a high defense, are fireproof, but slow. The mantis are great attackers, but can't repair as efficiently. The Engi have double the repair speed but they only do half the damage in hand to hand combat. The Zoltan can power the room they're in to spare power from your generator. The Crystal can lock down any room they're in, don't take as much damage from suffocation, but they move slightly slower. The Lanius will suck the oxygen from a room. Humans are the standard race that doesn't have any perk.You can hire new crew from stores, or pick them up along the way. There are slave ships that you can liberate or buy them from. Each member of your crew will gain experience on whatever they're working on. So its better to have a dedicated engineer than someone that goes from shields, to engineering, to piloting the ship. Their repair skills will also increase as they repair things. So when you're not in battle, it might be a good idea to have the entire crew help repair things.The game feels like Star Trek, while still being its own unique property. Helping civilizations, taking down space pirates, saving the federation from the rebel scum. The graphics might be simple, but you see exactly what's going on and you can even play it on some low tech systems. The music and sound design are excellent. The music is calming, spacy and enjoyable on its own.Each game lasts about 3 or 4 hours. Playing through and accomplishing goals will unlock new ships and new interior configurations for ships that you have. Each ship plays different and incorporates different strategies, not to mention the crew is different. Some ships start with a cloaking device, long range sensors, but no shields. Others have a super weapon, that cuts through other ships when its fully powered, but has a poor configuration. Still some ships are completely drone operated with only minimal weapons. Every game is a new way to play.There is a lot of strategy, depth and replay value to this game. Do you take out your enemy's engine, shields, weapons or robotic drones first? There are random events that make new challenges. Its a wonderful game worth $10.The game developer was nice enough to make a free update that adds even more content and replayability! The upgrades add a lot more quirky fun. Things like mind control, new weapons, a new race and new playable ships give you a lot of reason to return.			"

												FTL is an excellent example of how difficulty can be fun. I won't say that FTL is for everyone. It can be mind-numbingly difficult at times. It's the kind of game where you will play it for 20+ hours before your first win. On easy. The complexity and counterplay between making a decision during a battle and making a decision on what to buy or which beacon to explore leaves you with a rich gaming experience as each of these decisions can impact your attempt overall. Surprising depth in an amazingly simple package.			"

												On accident I took the medicine needed for an entire planet to survive.11/10it happens. As for a real review/message to newcomers in case if people get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by my quick and unoriginal comment, here:The game is fun, but can be RNG based, so a great deal of luck is needed for a beginner to win at first. After you start learning your own tricks and tips, the game will be less RNG reliant and more based on skill since you can use that skill to make the best out of a terrible RNG result or maybe even avoid an RNG tragedy entirely. Learn to play different ships since they are EXTREMELY varied because one may be more fun or easier for you (Those Lanius ships, horry ♥♥♥♥ lol they are fun and easy to command). You can board, shoot, hack, set aflame, and send drones to kill off a ship. Don't be discouraged by early deaths since there will be a learning curve. It will get increasingly fun until you actually complete it. Also, Advanced edition made the game very fun. I highly recommending it for a first playthrough.9/10			"

												Time to share my FTL story.It was a stealth ship - gifted by the Engi, a race of half organic half mechanical engineers who seeked to assist the Federation in any way they could. The Federation of course, were more than happy to accept the gift - In particular Tomas, JP and Shelton who were estatic at commandeering this state of the art technology. To aid them in the task, they hired an Engi, an act which they agreed would be fitting for it's first journey.Off they went, with hope hanging on a basic cloak system, the glaive beam and a couple of lasers. It was tough going at first without a shield, but they managed to rescue a Mantis, save a Rockman and acquire a drone. With a growing crew and the debris of pirates and foolish aggressors in their wake, the ragtag bunch of aliens fled the ever advancing rebel fleet. At one point the rebel fleet and the stealth ship clashed - but Tomas held steady at the helm, trusting his new crew members to fend off the enemies who boarded the craft and fired incessantly upon the blue-black creature. At one point, the engine caught fire - and JP came running out, it was unfortunately too much for a human. The gruff Rockman took one look, went in, and came out unscathed. It was a close one - they managed to escape and maintain some distance, but clearly things needed an improvement. And so in a timelapse-esque style, the ship grew in power and systems - upgraded engines, triple shields, terrifying drones and an energy sucking glaive beam that nearly bankrupted them all. But the stats of this weapon were too good to pass up, and Tomas the captain willingly threw in most of the ship's power to accomodate the beast. A few scrapes and cloaking maneuvers by Shelton made complete mincemeat of anyone who dared challenge the stealth ship, and by now the Rockman had made a friend, who was more than willing to see the mission through. Elsewhere, a young mantis teenager eager to participate in war games hopped on from his homelands, making the group seven in total. Though they all spoke different languages, and had different ideals, none dared challenge the eternal darkness and death that came with space, and it was this silent wish to live that propeled them onwards, as an engine would propel a shuttle. Of course, all journeys have to lead somewhere. For the lucky 7, it was time for the final battle. The rebel flagship closed in and Tomas maneuvered the craft with expert skill. Meanwhile, Shelton hammered at the enemy, drones fully engaged whilst the Rockmen focused their efforts on keeping the shields and cloak in orchestrated time. The Mantis ran around the cabins watching the carnage unfold - his time would come.Yet the mistake soon presented itself - the glaive beam was a too slow and power hungry and a wayward shot took it out almost immediately, leaving the ship with pitiful lazers. A barrage of missiles punctured metal and ripped debris into space - and with it, a horrible whine and woosh as air vacated the mangled rooms. It was at this time that the enemy teleported in, and the Mantis sprung into action. He clawed and carved his way through flesh and bone. The rockmen ran from room to room, extinguishing fires. Too little too late. With alarms blaring, Tomas looked on in horror - the engines were down, the health station was completely engulfed in fire and worse of all, the oxygen system had failed. Leaving the controls of what was now a sitting duck, the frightened Engi and Tomas crouched over the oxygen system, desperately trying to revive the lungs of a cold beast. Meanwhile, the Mantis was not having a easy time. Inexperienced and without help, a delicate dash ensued, as he dodged through vacuumed rooms and flaming debris. Dazed and terribly hurt, he headed to the engines. JP was nowhere to be seen - he was in fact also horribly injured, and lay in the sensor room, flames just feet away.Shelton had in this time also suffered terribly - first fire, then half his health to suffocation - he left the Rockmen to deal with the flames and crawled back to his controls, and it was then he realised that in all the frantic action, and with the ship 2 bars to oblivion, his prized drones were still up and running! The words hull critical flashed over and over through his screen, but he took several deep breaths.. and waited. The enemy ship turned to face them, it's weapons drawn, ready to seal the fate of it's prey. Shelton paused. There. The drones took the shield down for a split second and Shelton fired.A single desperate lazer shot made itself across the minute gap, past the regenerating shield. It tore into the hull and hit the engine with a horrifying explosion. In space, no one can hear you scream, and no one heard the explosions either.

Now time for normal difficulty.FTL is a fantastic game of strategy and risk, you will always be saying, eh just one more round at 8pm, then before you know it its 5:30am the next day. There is a large amount of content and hundreds of different combinations of events ensuring no game is the same as the one you previously played. Pros-Fairly simple to learn-Different scenarios for different gameplay each time-Different playing strategies-GREAT SOUNDTRACKCons-Death... So much death... (not necessarily a bad thing)-May get repetative for some people11/10 would get face eaten by giant space spiders again.Nominate for the 5 more minutes reward!			"

												FTL is an unique game, unlike anything you've played before. It mixes RTS combat with turn-based navigation and a story generator that will make you think well every decision you make. Its randomness  is a bit too much, but this is what makes it so special: it's impossible to know what awaits you.The game is cheap, has a huge replay value, thanks to its roguelike elements, comes with a free integrated expansion and mod support. There's a lot of cool mods made by the community (you can find them at www.ftlgame.com), including the Captain's Edition, an unofficial expansion that adds tons of content.Judging by the screenshots, FTL looks like a complicated game to play, but fear not, it isn't. It's quite simple to be honest. And surprisingly addictive. If you want a game to play over and over again, FTL can be your next choice.			"

												""do you think FTL is a good game?""TLDR: I think it's a fantastic game, FTL is a gold standard. But since you asked, I'll say why:The gameplay is great. You really want to start on Easy, and use the pause button very frequently. It's really a turn based game don't try to play it in real time. Then just try stuff, explore solar systems, and have a great time. Normal mode is hard enough that lots of people never beat it, and then they added a hard more that really is tough.The graphics are very simple but also very clean and clear. There is a lot more variation visually than you might think, but you will always know exactly what is happening at a glance. The music is really, really great. You don't need to be a fan of any specific type of music to appreciate how well the tone is constantly transmitted to you. Personally I wind up turning the music off in any game I play after a while, because you have heard it sooo many times, but with FTL I turn it back on, sometimes.There is lots of content to see. The different types of ships can change the tactical combat hugely, all kinds of things will have effects on the interactions you will have. Some people get frustrated because they have a hard time beating the final boss of the game, but the truth is that exploring the galaxy in various ways and encountering various things, the basic gameplay itself, is the point. The first time I got to the boss it was an accident and I was disappointed because I didn't get to finish the delivery quest I was working on.I have over 100 hours logged into Steam, and this game has gotten me through at least one long internet-free vacation on top of that. Most of that was before they added a huge, free expansion pack, too. If tactical turn based rougue like lite whatever space exploration sounds fun to you, at all, you will get some time out of this.The cherry on top of the FTL sundae is the price, it's been in a few bundles and goes 70-85% off pretty frequently. It's worth it at any price, really.			"

												A game that is always fun to play regardless of story, progress or success. The playing of the game itself is the ultimate reward. Dynamic, unexpected and consistently interesting combat and mechanics. Loads of ships and play styles. A change of ship, acquiring new upgrades or crew members, all have real impact on how you play. Something you can pick up for 5 minutes or 5 hours.If you haven't played it, now is the time. Find out why so many developers invoke FTL when they want to sell you on the idea that their game is fun and has depth and why it's almost never a good idea, because expecting something as good as FTL is almost always unfair to anything that isn't FTL One of the finest games ever made.

												Personal Rating: Terrific but unforgiving Space SimClassic Rating: ★★★★☆What makes FTL good for me?✓ Spaaaace: this is a quite simple Space Simulator and yet it's features' rich. ✓ Great atmosphere, short game sessions and high replay value.✓ Excellent Soundtrack, fits perfectly into gameplay.✓ Cute graphics, even if it lacks a proper fullscreen/high res setting.And then it's tough too because of:✘ RNG, which can be so frustrating.✘ Permadeath: True, you cannot save mid-game, you can only save and quit (to continue later).✘ A lot of micromanagement involved: every choice is hard to make and you can get killed in so many ways, each time a different one.I believe every one owns FTL already but if you don't yet, take advantage of the next sale and give it a go.

												Second playthrough:I encounter a pirate taking advantage of some poor defenseless civilians on some world...I decide to be the hero. I eradicate the pirate scum, however during the battle my medbay catches on fire!I send ensign Willow and Dolan into the fray to put out the fires.The battle is intense, yet seems manageable at first. Then, the fire catches on in the door control room, so I send the pilot, Hector, to assist.Both Willow and Dolan begin suffering from smoke inhalation and 3rd degree burns, so I tell them to get the hell out of there! Hector is also beginning to lost the fight with the flames, so I have him run back into the cockpit. As I try to figure out, wtf do I do now?... the fire catches on in the sensor room. In a short time I can no longer see any room on the ship other than those occupied by the horrified crew. It seems as if the end is here, after only 2 missions, when Hector gets the bright idea ""Hey, what if we turn off the oxygen systems!"" (You see, the rooms were not adjacent to the airlock, and even if they were, the door control room was destroyed so there was no possibility to remotely access them anyway.)Such a brilliant idea! It put out the fires! Then hector goes in to repair the medbay, with only 6 hp, and because, idk, maybe the fire accelerated the rate at which the oxygen was drained from that room, he suffocates and dies. But at least his dying words informed the rest of the crew that the plan indeed worked. Hector died a hero.Knowing the risks at this point, Willow waited until the O2 systems restored life support throughout the ship before going in to repair the medbay. After Willow and Dolan rocevered from their wounds, they finished repairing the rest of the ship. Now it is time to hold an honorable funeral for Hector.			"

												I'm pretty sure every nerd from my generation wanted to be a starship captain at some point. And while plenty of attempts at capital ship management have come and gone over the years, few seemed to capture the spirit of being a space commander like FTL. Featuring equal parts tactical combat, executive decisions, and airlocking tiny crewmembers, it's the one captaining sim that crosses over into whatever part of sci-fi tickles your fancy.In a charming twist, you are a federation captain trying to outrun the dastardly rebellion with valuable intel on their next move. There are dozens of ships you can start with, all featuring their own armaments, crews, and gimmicks, and all needing to be unlocked through deeds in game. You then have eight sectors of space to cross without being blasted, eaten, stranded, or otherwise murdered by hopping from jump point to jump point, one step ahead of the ever-encroaching rebel fleet. Some jump points will have enemy ships to fight, some will have story encounters where you get text options, some will have merchants, and so on. There's a remarkable amount of things to run into in FTL, so much that even 30 hours in you may be encountering things that are new to you.A large part of that journey of discovery is going to be the enemy ships that try to kill you. There are many kinds across the different races and factions, each one randomly rolled with weapons and systems. This is where the combat system really shines, because your own weapons and systems can be targeted manually to focus on the rooms that are causing you the most problems. If they have really nasty guns, you can obliterate their weapon control. If they have teleporters to send over boarding parties, you can blast it. If they're trying to get away, you can knock their engines out. Battles play out in real time but at a very measured pace, and you can pause freely to assess the situation and give new orders. It's an armchair commander's dream come true, watching the little crews scramble around their ships, fighting and putting out fires, as both vessels trade volleys.There's a lot to learn about the game, especially after the free update it got awhile back. Your ship can be upgraded with teleporters, drones, mind control, hacking, cloning bays, and more. Currency comes in the form of scrap, and learning how to best use your scrap might be the hardest part of the game since it needs to be spread across buying new equipment, upgrading your ship, and repairing your hull. FTL is a carefully-balanced game, keeping you a hair away from cold vacuum unless you've really mastered its intricacies. You need to know when to retreat from battle, when upgrading doors is more important that shields, and how long your crew can hold their breath. The learning curve is steep, but if you like the gameplay, having more to learn keeps the replay value high.Excellent, detailed pixel art and a delightfully atmospheric soundtrack round out this extremely deep package. With three difficulty levels and a bunch of unlockables and (internal) achievements to shoot for, FTL is an easy recommendation to anyone wanting a spaceship game in general. Your command over your vessel is so nuanced and gratifying that you'll find yourself caught up in the plight of your tiny crew over and over again. Mastering the art of combat and the delicate resource balance will take time and patience, but sticking it out to become a proper captain is a fantastically rewarding experience.			"

												As the rebels have come closer to find our ship and destroy us before we could send the message to what remains of the Federation Fleet, me and my crew decided to use the Long-Range Beacon to go to a nebula sector.What first seemed like a good idea, soon had bite back and hit us hard.Just as we were going through the nebula, observing the surroundings through every window possible, we soon found ourselves shot by a Mantis warship! They didn't even consider negotiating they just wanted our scraps and weapons.We locked on to their ship and started shooting, but in a mere second we had a boarding party on our ship. My crew wasn't capable of fighting 4 enemies at once, Berkley rushed to the cockpit as Matthieu and Jason locked themselves in the door control room and locked down the entire ship. Jason quickly opened the airlocks and vented every bit of oxygen from the ship, except the cockpit, surveillance room and door control room.As we were fighting with the intruders, our ship got devastated by enemy fire. Just after the intruders suffocated, we've got a direct hit on the life support system with a hull breach, but we managed to destroy their ship after all.Celebration had to wait, the life support system was down, we had a hull breach and the oxygen was escaping from the ship fast. Only 5% remaining, meaning there wasn't any oxygen left on the ship, but in the door control room and the cockpit. Berkley was wounded in the running and we had to make a decision fast. So I sent Matthieu and Jason to the life support system to repair it and the hull breach.Just before they closed the intercom channel, Matthieu said: ""It was an honour serving with you Captain.""They knew they signed up for a one way trip to save the rest of us. They took a deep breath, held it and ran to save the ship. Matthieu was losing consciousness fast and halfway through the repair he started to ran back to the control room to get some air, but he couldn't open the door. A few bangs on the door and it was over. Matthieu was gone. Jason held it for as long as he could, Matthieu repaired the hull breach so he had to worry about the life support system. Struggling with staying awake Jason pushed one last button before he exhaled his soul into the empty space and the system was back online. Oxygen started to spread across the ship, me and Berkley can finally breathe up.We rushed out from the cockpit to save the rest of the crew but it was too late. CPR and the med bay couldn't help them, they were already clinically dead. So it was only the two of us.Berkley started repairing the shield, the engines and the weapons system while I planned our route out of this wicked and cursed nebula.The damage was bad. Berkley got everything back to operational status but our hull damage was worse than ever. The ship barely held itself together.We managed to make it to a Long-Range Beacon and chose to go to a civilian sector now, hoping we would avoid any fight. The two of us could barely operate this ship, to be fully combat-effective, we tried to keep a low-profile until we get some crew members willing to join.After a few FTL jumps, I quikcly realized that no matter how hard I try to avoid a firefight, war doesn't work like that. No sectors are safe from pirates, slavers, rebel symphatizers and criminals. A pirate ship fully equipped and ready to blow us to pieces, required a toll from us to go past this sector. We didn't have too much scrap and it wasn't enough for them. We begged for their mercy but they didn't listen. One last fight, we locked on their ship and started shooting. It was only a few shot. With the first 3 shot they took out our engines, the surveillance room and the shields. Berkley got severely injured but was still trying to fight the fire in the engine room which came from the explosion, though due to his injuries Berkley was consumed by the fire in the end.Shooting a few more rockets and laser shots in the enemy seemed like a hopeless effort to breach through their strong shields and the last shot have marked our fate.As the ship was blown to pieces and I've got sucked out into space by the vacuum, there was only a few seconds to reflect on my life.Only a few seconds until I became the frozen captive of the empty space.I strongly recommend this game!You have the abilityto re-route power on your ship, vent the rooms to kill the intruders, while you are under fire and repairing severe damages on your ship, you have to cause damage to the enemy ship as well.Can't write much about it. Just simply amazing I always wanted to manage my own starship and crew. :DMass Effect was just a little demo to what this game offers for you. :D			"

												There are some games, which you can easily describe in a sentence. Army man shoots another army man, the team of Russia, Aztecs and Rome gets destroyed by the sneaky Gandhi, survivor walks for an hour, finds another survivor and drinks bleach. Yet, as much as I try to put FTL into a single sentence, I keep failing. A space-ship commander simulator, which lets you relive your captain fantasies of Star Trek? An easy to pick up rogue-lite, which will make you scream as your three hours’ worth of upgrades are blasted into junk by the final boss? A story, with an outcome almost entirely the same every time you play, but with a journey worth an entire sci-fi novel by itself? All of those things and much, much more are present here.FTL stands for Faster Than Light. A term usually used in various science fiction works. Just like this game. You might command a ship consisting of a bunch of humans and a slug, going through the Rock homeworlds and getting ambushed by space pirates. You direct all your power to the weapons, blast them a few rounds and then masterfully evade their gigantic missile by activating your cloaking device. After the pirates beg for mercy, you ponder for a minute about how much scrap and fuel can you get if you’d leave them or destroy them. Moments later, their orange-and-purple ship is obliterated into thousands of tiny pieces in spectacular 2D graphics. Your crew has just finished fixing the oxygen bay and you’re ready to move out. As you’re about to engage your FTL Engine, you take a second to admire the gorgeous scenery, I mean, space. Space can be really beautiful too, you know. Three minutes later your whole crew dies to killer Rock-men, who boarded your ship. Time to start again. FTL stands for Flying Till Losing. Because once you lose you can’t fly. Unless you restart the game. But why would you restart such an amazing run with a space-monk Zoltan Cruiser. They might be weak in melee combat, but their super-shields disable enemy boarding systems, so killer Rock-men aren’t a problem now. Navigating through the map, you see a distress signal left by someone. Great, people in distress always mean there’s some money, err, scrap to be found! Bah, another pirate ambush. Oh well, all you have to do is send all power to the guns and… BOOM! Your ship is nigh-unstoppable. Oh man, in space nobody can hear you scream, but the sounds of explosion and lasers shooting are so amazing, almost as awesome as the battle music! The themes are just great, they accompany, but not overshadow what happens in the game. Well, time to move on. Six minutes later you find yourself unable to escape the pursuing rebels and clash against one of their giant ships. Your super shield is gone almost immediately, and you meekly Zoltan crew dies from the engulfing flames. Let’s restart.FTL stands for Failing To Leave. Basically, this is one addictive game. Yes, frustration might get you, since it’s almost inevitable that your game will end up as a loss, this game is that hard. However, various unlockable ships and layouts help give some sense of progression, as this is a permanent-death game. Still, after a break, you will want to play more. Boot the game up, maybe choose a different ship. Yeah, the Engi Layout B seems cool-enough. Different ships not only change the visuals, but essentially the way you play. Standard ships might use the “blast-and-away” tactics, but horrible space-bugs Mantis usually try to get their prey by boarding. Space-human-robots (seeing a pattern here? SPACE!) Engies love to use drones and that means that they rarely do all the fighting themselves, instead, relying on autonomous robots to protect or attack. Alternative ship layouts take it one step further, in Engi case, there’s only one crew-member on board, rest of them are drones. That would be extremely problematic, however, various updates and even mods help the game get even more complex. For example, Captain’s Edition mod allows the sole Engi create new crewmember holograms. With an army of holo-friends, my Engi is ready to win this game. Twelve minutes later, the Engi ship runs out of fuel, getting lost in deep space. We will try again.FTL also stands for Flailing Through Levels. Your Rock cruiser finally manages to reach close to the final stage. Take a moment, go ahead, and reflect what a run was that. You saved a space station from an outbreak, helped the Zoltans reach nirvana, beat the mighty Mantis pirate KazaaakplethKilik and even unlocked his ship. You fought countless pirates, saved a defective rebel and helped lay off a siege of a friendly space station. One last foe until you’re ready to fight what awaits at the end of the game. The huge rebel space-ship proves no match for your skills, as you seamlessly transfer power from guns, to engines, to clone bay, all while choosing which parts of the opposing ship should be destroyed. The dream scenario: a victory against a worthy foe with minimal losses. You take a deep breath, time to see what lies in the final level. Eighteen minutes later, you enjoy the final moments of a Rock cruiser, little flaming bits of it flying in space. The boss was so close to defeat, yet you still lost. We are ready to win next time.

												FTL is a roguelike game based in space, where you guide your ship from beacon to beacon, and sector to sector. At each beacon, you encounter an event. Sometimes it will be nothing, sometimes it will be a pirate fight, sometimes it will be someone in distress that needs your help. It puts you in different scenarios, where your actions determine your fate, your future, and that of the creatures around you. The great soundtrack of this game will easily get stuck in your head, and you still won’t hate it! With runs lasting up to 2 hours if you drag it on to the end, this game is fun and worthwhile, if not simply to get a couple hours for your money’s worth.The controls are very simple, and most of the buttons have hotkeys to speed things up and make it easier. However, sometimes the controls are unresponsive. You can click and even press the hotkeys as much as you want, and it won’t work. I have played on multiple different computers, and have even talked to friends experiencing the same problem. This is one of the biggest issues with the game, as timing is often vital in battle situations and being delayed even a second can get you screwed in battle.While this game is very fun to start, and without a doubt quite challenging, it does eventually get boring and repetitive. There isn’t very much variation in the events, and you end up going through the same situations over and over again with very few different possible outcomes. The events are essentially what makes the game interesting, and I think having more to this aspect of the game would increase the amount of time you spend playing FTL by a lot. Even the advanced edition content added very little from what I could tell. Although this doesn’t affect gameplay at all and isn’t a big deal, I don’t like how you can’t have your own preset ship and crewman names, and crewman positions. If you want to set your own names, you have to reset it individually each time (aside from using the restart button to keep the same names as your last run). And every run, the crew will start in the default positions, so if you don’t like them, you have to move them every time. I often forget and end up moving them in the middle of the first fight, which isn’t a big deal, but can be annoying.Being able to set the crew positions is one of the most useful features. You can have your crew running around and repairing things or fighting off intruders, and when they’re all done, send them all back to their positions instantly at the press of a button! It’s useful to keep everyone in position at all time. It’s also really helpful given that moving crew individually is kind of awkward. The left click-right click maneuver is weird, and annoying to get used to. Left click to select then left click to move would work fine, as it’s the same system used for the weapons. Then right click can be used to deselect. Currently it’s the reverse of the controls for weapon use, and this makes it even more inconvenient to get used to.While many people will tell you that this game is extremely difficult, I will have to disagree. I found that it’s challenging, but sometimes in the end you just kind of get killed by random events. Sometimes a random event will get a lucky shot in, and you lose a vital team member or just an unlucky sequence of shots that puts you in a really bad situation. Of course sometimes you will lose of making your own mistake or being new to the game and what not, but often it will be because of an unlucky bad situation you were put in.The end-game sectors are where the game starts to legitimately get tougher. This is a good thing, because the progressive increase in difficulty forces you to adapt your strategy and equipment to take down shields more efficiently and make sure you can survive yourself. This transition into the more difficult sectors can be tough, and there’s really no way to get past it unless you’re ready for it coming out of the previous sectors. You need to upgrade your ship sufficiently, get better weapons and the system upgrades to power them, at least 3 levels of shield and probably a couple extra crewmen from the default 3. Sometimes this is impossible, and it can ruin a run, but it also forces you to think ahead a bit and prepare, which is good. In the end though, it should always be possible to win a run using just skill of the game.The final boss is also the only extremely hard part of the game. You have to fight 3 phases of it, in between which you could in theory go back to a repair station and fix up your ship, but chances are you either won’t be able to get to one without it being taken over by the rebels, or on your way back after getting fixed up you’ll fight more rebels and get weakened again. The later phases honestly become close to impossible without certain exact equipment which you have to be lucky to get.Overall, this game is fun for a while, and if you’re willing to persevere through all the tough parts to get really good at this game, there could easily be more than 100 hours worth of gameplay to unlock all the extra content. But in the end, for your casual gamer or roguelike lover, this game is probably only worthwhile to get while it’s on sale (which does happen pretty frequently). For me, this game was fun for a while, but about 15 hours in I started getting bored of runs half way through and it stopped being worthwhile to keep playing.			"

												NEVER GO FOR THE GIANT ALIEN SPIDERS...unless you have a clone bay that is...It's a game that's based on 10% skill and 90% luck (aka 0.00...01% skill and 99.99...99% luck).It's a game that requires patience and can easily take 10+ hours to beat for the first time.It's a game you will definitely not beat on the first try.It's a game that will make you want to impale the devs on a cactus and let them die of thirst. Or in FTL speak, give them up to slavers.It's a game with amazing replayibility, and is amazingly addictive.It's a game that's easily moddable (you can find mods at www.ftlgame.com).It's a game that I've managed one victory on hard mode.It's a game that I'm still learning things from and finding new events.It's a game I give 10/10, have 151 hours in, and bought for $3.33.

FTL delivers well-balanced and entertaining gameplay. You will feel true panic when their systems are being overloaded and the oxygen room takes a hit whilst their crew is simultaneously running around for repairs and fighting off enemies who’ve boarded the vessel. The action can get hectic, but it never stops being fun.Combat is great with challenging micromanagement, as crew members of each species are fitted for different tasks. There are a four types of weaponry: missiles, lasers, beams, and bombs. Each have their own advantages - missiles go through shields, lasers don’t require ammo, beams hit more than one room, and bombs simply explode a lot. Finding what combinations work best – and exploiting the ones which do – is one of the most entertaining parts of the game. The only thing FTL truly lacks is full-featured content. What it has included in the game is well-balanced and performs to near perfection, but there might not be enough to satisfy players who want to thoroughly explore the game.THE GOOD- Impressive depth- Intuitive gameplay- Great value for money- Great combat- Fun story decisionsTHE BAD- Basic audioDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												 let's be honest here: in war, there are no good guys and bad guys, it's us and it's them. it is their job to kill us, while it is our job to kill them and survive. that's that's what's behind the rebel captain telling you ""it's nothng personal, just following orders.""it's up to the player make the decisions to either follow the general ""rules of war"", be a inhumane monster, or some mix that just brings max benefit. what's so great about the vagueness of the story is that the player can and often will fill in the blanks. many times without even realizing they are (i mean, look how often ""space nazis"" comes up, and there's really no indication of this at all).the gameplay is all about learning to deal with what you are given.  though it may seem harsh sometimes, it is still possible to beat the game on hard with every ship.  you need to learn what to upgrade, and when.  you also need to know when you need to put that on the backburner to buy an important weapon or augmentation.  pause often.the music is enjoyable, and the graphics serve to let you know what is happening, which is all i really ask for in a game.the developers are fairly swell, a crowdfunding success story.  they even gave us advanced edition, which is a ton of content.

												Victory is sweetest when you've experienced defeat, and FTL allows you to experience that tenfold. Easy to learn yet difficult to master, FTL is not all about RNG but about the player's perseverance and dedication. But that can be said about any rougelike. What make's FTL special is its pausable real time combat system, allowing for easy micromanagement and the development of complex strategies. And strategy pays off.The iPad version is a great way to pass time while traveling for those who don't want to spend hours at a computer.			"

												- Played game a few times but i'll tell the story when i got to the Boss.- Ok i heard this ship was difficult so i got to give it EVERYTHING i got- Uses tacticts and does pretty well- Then a middle part of the battle when i missed ALL OF MY SHOTS- At this time i had about 15 hp left so i was still good - Loses more and more but then he has 3hp left- Pray that shots will hit- After a while of trading shots and in panic because of alot of my stations (Like the piloting room the shield room and so on) was on fire and some on red damage- The boss has 1 hp, and so do i- All my shots miss - 3 of his hits me GG10/10 would be tied with a Flagship again. And be sad because i failedIm going to continue trying btw.- My second try was with the Engi ship....- Pretty much same storyFeel even more sad- I tried a 3rd time, finished him off. - I COMPLETELY forgot that he has more than 1 life.- Failed against the drone flagship.Many tries, got some ships, but then the Great Day!After losses upon losses I DID IT. (On easy mode)The Federation Cruiser is my hero.And when i say that i the WoozieWolf! I FEEL ACCOMPLISHED. It took me 18 hours of testing strategies, trial and error, to do it, but that's not bad!And i say GG Now this is a more serious part of the review.I'll have to say this game is alot of fun, even IF you're a bit of a casual player. You just have to learn the basics. It may be difficult, stressing, triggering and even boring. But it's not the competitive aspect of the game that made me love it, it's the feel of acomplishment. Like when i got the Federation ship, and won the game with it, and how i got the rock ship, and when i unlocked all of these i got the LANIUS cruiser. And the replayability is, just crazy. And if you want a challange on easy mode just use a type C ship. They're usually difficult to use. And i do TRULY recommend this game if you have time and effort to use. You'll truly love it if you like singleplayer games. (And space! :D)Well this is the end of my ""Review""I hope it Helps?And maybe got you to buy the game.			"

												I REALLY wish there was some sort of neutral review option instead of the up or down thumbs. Let me just say that this game is extremely fun. It is extremely polished and it will keep you coming back for more time and time again when you die. And yes, you will die....ALOT. The main problem i have with this game is how it always seems like your opponents dont play by the same rules as you. This is laughably apparent when you encounter the flagship, but more on that later.This is a game where the RNG (random number generator or random number god) holds your fate in its hand almost every time you do a jump. It does not matter how decked out your ship is, how many max level crew you have or how prepared you THINK you are. Like i said in the previous paragraph, the game does not play by the same rules as you, and you will find many enounters that feel unfair, or some that are flat out impossible to win against depending on what ship you pick.And that leads me to the games boss, the flagship. If you manage to get to this behemoth of a ship, you will probably do what i did the first time i encountered it. First you will be awe struck at how big and how many systems and weapons it has, and then when it fires that first volley of lasers and missles which seem to never end, you will sit back, laugh out loud and roll your eyes. I am by no means saying the flagship cant be beaten, because it most definitely can. The problem is in order to beat it there are really only a small list of ship ""builds"" that are effective, and even with those setups, grasping victory can seem very difficult. Alot of the time you have to rely on luck, because while you think that 55% evasion you have actually equals 55%, it will feel like 10% when a full volley of missles and 2 volleys of lasers all impact with almost no misses whatsoever.As i said, the game is very fun, its definitely worth your time, and you will come back for more no matter how stupidly frustrating it can be.  Just realize that all the planning and ship upgrades in the world are just one or two jumps from ending up as space debris at any given moment.			"

												Bought this game for 3$ on a steam sale, which I realise is a total steal now that I've had my time to play it. I am yet to have a boring moment in my 8 hours of playing, as I have been occupied every second. It manages to do this even with its conceptually repetitive playthroughs, each short but still lively with original content and dilemmas that keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through. To put it in perspective, I have NEVER been without a chore, either fleeing, attacking, repairing, upgrading, or attempting to douse fires via lack of oxygen but find that the oxygen generator room is broken and that I'll have to repair it, but soon realise that it's completely futile as both the oxygen room itself and all the rooms around it are devoid of any oxygen, and that I might as well restart now as my crewmates will slowly suffocate to death but maybe, MAYBE, PLEASE I'M BEGIING YOU-   Nope, nevermind. I rate this game a solid 8/10, which my former self would've said nah, not worth it, CS:GO can keep me awake until 2 o'clock in the morning before I remember that I have multiple quizzes and tests the next day. But if you put it into perspective, I wouldn't rate many games above 8 that cost 30 bucks or more, and I literally snagged this for a TENTH of that price. Now my new ""Wait, I have homework tomorrow, right? Eh, whatever..."" game, can confirm totally worth.			"

												excellent game, If any game can make feel like a true spaceship captain its this one. +controlls are excellent+ excellent graphics+ challenging gameplay+ unique concepts-almost unfair in difficulty at timesUPDATEnow that the update is out there is almost nothing more to ask for in this game. There is hour upon hour of content and hundreds of styles of play. The addition of mind control and the clone bay change the game significantly. Im not completly certain but it seems like the difficulty has been tweeked a bit making easy mode actually easy.Highly recommend well worth the price			"

1-sentence review :Great game with great atmosphere, although the combats lack a little bit of depth and can get repetitive, especially at the beginning of a run ; it is anyway a must-play by everybody who calls himself a gamer ! :)Pros :- many different ships, builds & equipments- many different events- great gameplay mechanisms- skills matter, but...Cons :- ... but luck matters a lot, even if there's a lot of skills to learn, luck will decide of the fate more often than not ; for me, it's ok, but it's better to be aware of that- once learned, combats are relatively simple, and get repetitive, especially in the early stages ; reworking the weapon systems with more frequent upgrades and easier swapping (ie: could resell weapon for a better price) would have fixed a good part of the issue			"

												I nominated this game for a ""Best Game Design Award"" because it is simply a perfect gem, every game mechanic, every element is there for a reason, it's the total opposite of what most triple A games do lately with their feature creep open worlds that feel as big as empty and far less interesting (both narratively and gameplay wise) than ""smaller"" games like FTL.I don't particularly love ""rogue like"" games, that ""resets"" on every game and nonetheless I liked this a whole lot.It's cheap, it's worth the risk, do you a favor and play it :)			"

FTL is an impressive indie title which grasps players by the neck and makes them sweat with every decision as they are thrust into the threshold of space. FTL's Soundtrack is incredibly well done. It has a retro style to it, but that doesn't mean it is cheap. Far from it, actually, as the soundtrack professionally weaves emotions of adventure, battle, and most of all, going against all odds as you survive against the difficulty of your journey. This can be noticed as you can hear the happier, adventurerous themes while you explore the systems, or the intensity of the final battle, amplified by the drums. Also the overall melody of the soundtrack feels like something straight out of a space adventure, which helps it develop a little bit more of a personality, a personality, which, most games seem to have left behind.FTL's Graphical style is unique, it's top down and you see into the ship, and the characters are little sprites. At release, it was interesting to see a game go back to this style, and going back to it, it actually ages quite well. It's not visually impressive, but it doesn't look bad either. Also, this means the game runs on basically anything.The art style actually complements the gameplay, as the gameplay is the most important part of the game. Looking at the ship from a top-down perspective allows you to make tactical decisions based on the room, based on what is happening in the room, and based on who, or what, is in the room. For instance, is there a fire in the next room? Can we starve the room of oxygen to remove the fire? Can we lock the doors to keep intruders at bay and possibly kill them using the oxygen deprived environment or the raging inferno? Is the hull breached in the room, and is it safe enough to fix it before we suffer critical damage?These are the kinds of questions you will constantly ask yourself over the course of the game, and these are the sort of questions that will keep you playing.In FTL, you command a ship with your crew, and you may unlock more ships ( and therefore, more playstyles ), which will allow you to make completely different journeys each time, especially considering the fact that no journey will ever be the same. Each ship has a different crew, and you can even name the crew, making the experience just a little bit more personal.""I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.""Er, speaking of the crew, every ship needs a crew. When you lose all of your crew members, you will lose the game. You'll also lose if the ship is blown up, but that was a given.The crew is a vital part of the gameplay experience. You'll need multiple members to utilize every system in the ship, and I'll talk about systems later. The crew is needed to repair critical damage, man systems, fight in close quarters, and participate in various events that you will encounter. There are different species, all with different benefits. Here's a few:Human - Trains skills fasterRockman - No Fire Damage, 150 Health, slowed movement.Zoltan - Provides 1 free power to room, 75 health, explodes on death.Engi - Repairs fast, horrible at combat.Now, these aren't all of the species, because I want to let you discover them, and because it'll be a nice surprise. Certain species can have a positive influence on events, so be sure to add a touch of diversity to the crew.FTL has a perma-death system. There is no checkpoints. No savestates, or whatever. No going back until you die or complete your mission.Victory or death.So, how do you survive? This sounds tough.Well, a big part of survival in FTL is the combat, because well, there are so many things that will try to kill you.The weapons you have on your ship play a huge role in this, so let's list a couple to give you a good understanding.Lasers - Simple, but effective. They are versatile, but have no particular strength. They are easily blocked by enemy shields.Since lasers have many variations, they can be very powerful if you've got the right strategy in mind.Missiles - This type of weapon will penetrate enemy shields and has a good chance to do some solid damage and even breach hulls, but it is easily countered by defensive drones.These weapons consume one missile, so they are a bit costly to maintain.Weapons aren't the only important thing in battle.Systems are powerful additions to your arsenal, especially the essential ones. They are just as important as weapons, if not more important.Shields and engines are the big two that will keep you alive. Shields stop damage, and engines allow you to escape and evade.The weapons system is also important. If these don't work, you can't fight back. And if you can fight back, you'll probably die too.You also need oxygen, because without it, the crew can't breathe, obviously, and die.And there are also sensors, which serve as your eyes ( aside from the crew ).Now here is where crew and systems come hand-in-hand:Having someone man a particular system makes it work a bit better. Keeping the crew alive will reward them with expertise as they get better at what they do.A good pilot means you can evade a bit more. Someone good at repairing can fix things faster than the regular guy.A crew good at combat, and armed with a teleporter, can jump onto the enemy vessel and kill all of the enemy.The importance of systems make it that much more tense in combat. Let's say, for instance, that with a couple of hits to my ship, I'm dead.If I don't pull off the next battle like a pro, I'm done for. Here's where systems and weapons work together to create an impressive gameplay dynamic:I've got powerful shields that lets me absorb the enemy laser fire, but they won't hold up forever.I've got two missiles, and two lasers, and my upgraded sensors allows me to see inside the enemy ship.I notice that they only have two crew members for whatever reason, so I target their weapons, to keep myself alive, and then I focus on the room where the second enemy crew member is, killing him with a lucky hull breach and fire in the room.That crew member happened to be manning the shield systems at the time, so I get to easily pound the enemy with lasers.The last enemy, who is trying to escape, rushes to the cockpit, which I target. With the cockpit in ruins, he has to repair it before he can escape. And he can't fight back without an active weapon system.He's done for, and for now, I live.Let's fast forward a bit, and let's say I went into a nebula. My sensors are down, and my crew are my only eyes on the ship. Even I don't know who, or what is on my ship. We don't even have that much power to spare, so I can only power the vital systems, and only use one of my weapons.I battle an enemy, and he takes out my shield, but I can't spare anyone to fix it because he also got lucky and hit my oxygen at the same time. Since I couldn't tell what was happening on my ship, a fire broke out and is now consuming half of my ship. My engines are burned before I can deprive the room of oxygen, and we're sitting ducks. One final laser hits my ship, and our story ends.Another big part of survival is based on the choices you make.In FTL, you are sometimes forced to make tough decisions that can either help you, or hurt you.Sometimes you will ask yourself, 'Is this risk worth it? What if I lose someone?'Sometimes you will tell yourself, 'I have to take this risk. If I don't, we're going to die.'While some people argue that it is too luck based and random at times, I have to disagree, because this adds to the tense nature of the choices you make.In real life, when you make a decision, you don't know what will, or could happen, and in these random events, sometimes you will come across a bit of text that reveals a bit more of the universe to you, giving the game a little bit more personality as you move faster than light.

												I'll be honest : I am not keen on really difficult games and Rogue-likes are not my preferred games either. Yet, FTL is a almost insanely hard rogue-like and I have enjoyed so many times playing it (and losing miserably). Winning a game is arguably one of my proudest moments on videogames.What works brilliantly with FTL is that it's hard, but as games are played over and over, the player will get better, without feeling any sense of boredom or thinking that he/she cannot beat the game. The game can be beat, and the stories with your ship and crew are vividly tales, accompanied by a superb musical score, if you are into electronic space music.Anyway, don't let yourself evade this game because of its genre or its difficulty. It's worth it.			"

												I agree with everything positive said about this game.Also, this game is mean. It doesn't like me. It won't like you. Oh, you'll like the game, but it will use that to its advantage to show you how much it *doesn't* like you. Sometimes you may think it likes you. You may think FTL is your friend. But that's just to make you that much more upset when it shows you otherwise. It will hurt your feelings. I'm only playing it on easy, and I'm quite angsty at the moment.You'll be going along, happily building your ship up and lazering the crap out of anyone who gets in your way, gathering up scrap, and then suddenly something comes at you with a missile launcher (bypasses shields), missiles your shields, and their two beam drones make lunch meat out of your ship, while you're all ""b-b-but...I can shoot them like 7 times a round! I mean, I could before my weapons room was ON FIRE.""  The game is very RNG dependant, but I almost feel like that's kind of realistic, in this case. Regardless, the RNG plus the ability to screw yourself up, is pretty brutal.TRIGGER WARNING: THIS GAME HURTS FEELINGS ON PURPOSE.11/10 would be sad and angry metal salami (SAAMS) againPS - Screw the shop owner that warned me how dangerous things were when I pulled in with multiple sections of my ship ablaze.

												The first thing anyone should know about FTL: Faster Than Light, is you will die, often. FTL is Very fun game if you don't mind a challenging experience and permadeath. The storyline is basically you have to fly across the galaxy with an important objective, to warn your people of the incoming invasion, or something along those lines. The base gameplay is almost a turn based action game, with the ability to pause and select how and where you wish to attack. You command the basic ship at the start with the ability to unlock more ships as you progress through the game. The game is composed of 5 Sectors, each with ramping difficulty, but most players should be able to survive through them. The final stage the play must fight a boss ship, winning the game if they destroy it, but restarting all over if the fail. Depending on the ship you fly, there are all kinds of different mods, weapons, rooms, and crew members (of many races and abilities) to acquire, creating many different playstyles. These are purchased with scrap, the in game currency acquired by selling things at stores, completing side mission and destroying ships. Destroying ships also gives you drone parts, used for different types of drones, missiles, used for, well, missile launchers, and fuel. If you ship runs out of fuel in space, you can either wait for the bad guy army to catch up to you, or you can set a distress beacon. Throughout the game, the bad guys are chasing after you. You only have so much time to acquire resources and move on before you are overwhelmed. The galaxy in the game is randomly generated each time, and each sector is randomly generated as well, and each area in each sector is also randomly generated. The game will never be the same 2 playthroughs in a row. This adds replayability into the game, making the permadeath seem less of a drawback and more of an opportunity. The game, although retro looking, is actually beautiful. The graphic style suits the game very very well. The sound in the game is amazing, the music is so inviting and fits the game perfectly.FTL does many things right.ReplayabilityMany play stylesa constant feeling that every choice you make has real significanceThe graphic style of the game suits it very well. The music and sound of the game are phenomenal and fit so wellThe diverse races make the galaxy seem more populatedThe random events and their consequences make the player feel more in controlThe DLC/expansion is freeModding communityHas steam trading cardsFTL does some things wrong. The end boss is extremely difficult There are a few bugs that still haven't been patched outThe game can feel tedious if played more than 20 hoursSome playstyles, although fun, are near impossible to win withSometimes sectors are over populated, and you get into too many space battlesThe “luck of the draw” feeling comes in as you continue to playThis game is very fun to someone who likes a challenge. I would suggest that the best way to enjoy this game is not look try to enjoy beating the boss, enjoy the journey through space. Or even too try to earn the achievements to give the game another perpous. The game has its issues but all in all it is a great deal of fun. The modest price of $10.99(CAD) Is worth is to someone who might put 15+ hours into it. If its on sale, i think everyone should pick up this game, it's a wonderful little nugget of gold in the vast desert that is the steam indie game section.  "

 Faster than Death  TL;DR FTL is a Difficult and extremely intense strategy game, With every fight being one that might end your journey and resources being scarce you’ll be on the edge of your seat throughout your adventures. A fantastic soundtrack that always sets the tone of the battle. The Further in the adventure you get the more attached to your crew you’ll become making their demise that more real.Follow us here Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipPros 
Great soundtrackLarge array of ships to choose fromIntense strategic battlesVery easy to start a new game Many secrets and challenges to unlockCons Random difficulty rampsVery dependent on RNGNo way to save ships through a new game+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GameplayThis game is one of the few game I use the pause feature in to strategize my attacks and defense. After you do place where you want to attack you’ll have to sit back and watch at the edge of your seat as your weapons charge up and hope that they land. There are instances where your ship will catch fire or have a breach or be invaded, then you must fix the problems while still in the middle of a space battle. The game is great at being simple chaotic fun. The management of resources is just as important as anything else, you need to get as much scrap before fighting the final boss at a better chance to win. If your ship runs out of fuel you’ll be at the mercy of passing ships while still being chased by the rebellion. StoryKnowing that you are being chased by an overwhelming enemy and there are more ahead of you adds so much to the tension of the game. You can’t stay in a sector to long or you’re going to get caught by the extremely difficult rebellion battlecruisers. You are forced to continue and to meet the final boss with the little resources you were able to get. Characters What FTL does beautifully is creating character you get attached to without them being unique. The longer they are able to survive in the journey the better the become at the job they were assigned, so it really is crushing when one of them dies because you weren’t paying attention to the oxygen levels or something small like that. It is rare in a run to hit the max limit on crew sizes at least for very long. Art/Graphics With the simple pixel art and animations FTL is able to convey extreme space battles and an overwhelming sense of dread. With slight additions made to your ui, like a red flashing light the game jumps from 3 to a 10 really fast.Bonus Notes FTL I like to believe is a game for any steam library it’s a brilliant lunch game and the permadeath aspects means little commitment, the ability to just hop into a new game makes it worth the small price. Also, the addition of free content makes me love the developers of the game.If you like this join us here to get the latest Reviews:Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamship "

												This might seem a bit lengthy, but hear me out... I was playing the game, of coarse, and I happened to come across an enemy that only had a Burst Laser to hurt me (for those who don't know, it fires two lasers at your ship). I had two shields up and all he would do was bring them both down, recharge his weapon, and hit me again, doing literally no damage to my ship's hull what so ever. At that time, I was about to jump to the next area, but then I realised something... My crew was leveling up despite me doing nothing Their skill increased as this helpless little enemy was trying his hardest to simply put a scratch on me, so I did what anyone would have done. I left the game running, went to the kitchen, heated up some food, ate the food, went on Youtube, watched some videos, went back to the game, noticed they were skilled up all the way in that one section of the ship, switched them around, went to the bathroom, did some school work, came back, switched them around again, took a nap, watched all episodes of Game of Thrones, ran a marathon, cured cancer, etc etc. I did this until they were fully leveled up in everything that required nothing to do. 10/10 Would find loophole again  "

												FTL: Faster Than Light is a true gem in the rogue-like genre that never fails to disappoint. FTL has you take charge of a ship (of your choice) in the Federation fleet to take on the Rebels and defeat their flagship. FTL is all about managing your ship and your crew effectively in order to make your ship powerful enough to fight the boss (good luck with that one).+Nice art style+An incredibly good OST+It's set in space, who doesn't love space?+Each playthrough (depending on which systems you get and whether or not you beat the boss) takes between 20-30 minutes so it's easy to play a quick game+A wide range of ships to choose from/unlock including different layouts of the same ship+Several different races, each with their own specialities and backstories+Lots of customisation options for ships+Different ships suit different playstyles +Plenty of different enemy ship types+Extremely replayable+Some really good mods, especially FTL Infinite, and the game is simple to mod+/-The boss is extremely hard to beat, I still haven't beaten it at the time of writing this review but it doesn't really matter because playing through the game and unlocking new ships is where the fun comes from-Some of the ships are extremely difficult to unlock-It has in-game achievements but no Steam achievementsVerdict:9.5In my opinion this is one of the best, if not the best, rogue-likes on Steam and is a must have for all rogue-like fans.El K.

												A game where you control your crew members and the starship they pilot, going on missions, dealing with crises, battling foes, and having encounters with weird aliens has a lot of appeal.  This game brims with potential, most of which it lives up to.In the beginning, though, you don't really know what you're up against.  Playing on easy until you've got the confidence to advance is almost a necessity.  The game can feel capricious, punishing you for taking any risk, or slowly bleeding you by opportunity cost for taking no risk.  Later on,you'll know how the encounters you'll be facing stack up, and will only bother with the outfits that work well or choices that have paid out in the past.  There's still a few different playstyles, using different types of weapons, or boarding, or such, but it can definitely play out in a similar manner.It's also kind of a pain to unlock everything, because doing so involves either playing perfectly to get achievements or getting very lucky with finding certain encounters.  The crystal ship, in particular, is such a huge annoyance that I'll call it out specifically.  That one really should have been made so that you could advance towards it over multiple games, rather than having to get that '1 in a million' run.There are other minor irritations, too, like how poorly the game handles power juggling with Zoltan crew members.Once you've seen everything the game can do, you start to feel more acutely the stuff it can't do.  You'll never get in a big space battle with multiple ships.  You'll never go on a real 'away mission', at least one that's not handled entirely through text.  You'll never play anything but the same scenario (defeating the rebel flagship), unless you experiment with some user-made mods.Still, what's there is pretty good quality, and there are a lot of different encounters.  Some of them are really rare, while others crop up all over the place.  It's a nice game for short increments of time.Ed. The advanced edition just makes it even better.			"

												Faster Than Light is quite an amazing little game. It looks over simplistic at first, but there are several layers to discover, strategies and random events to make every attempt to beat the game challenging, unique and a lot of fun (expect most attemps will fail). It quickly became one of my favorites in my library of 1300+ games.This game is not for everyone, but if you like difficult turn-based strategy (combat is actually ""real-time with pause""), sci-fi, single player and roguelikes/permanent-death, you cannot go wrong with this one. It's definately not a game for those who only enjoy action games and mindless shooting and running. It takes a only a few hours to complete a game if you make it to the end, but you will probably have to restart several dozen of times before you reach that point in the first (unless you play in easy mode, which I never tried so I don't know).That being said, it you are not turned off by anything I wrote, buy FTL immediately. Gameplay is absolutely fantastic and addictive.			"

												There is absolutely nothing more demoralizing than dedicating almost 2 - 3 hours on a single playthrough just to get to the final boss and die. Yes there is. Dedicating another playthrough of 2 - 3 hours just to get to the final boss and die again. So if you're up to the task of wasting hours of your life away just to fall short of the finish line, try it. The feeling of victory is sweet and you will proudly soak up the accopmlishment of knowing you've saved the Federation. But if you lose, you sit there wondering to yourself... Is it me? Do I suck? Or is this game just cruel? Why do I keep coming back to it? Could I have done anything different? Is there a perfect load out? Is it just luck? Is it even possible to beat this game on any other mode but EASY? Am I a masochist? What am I doing with my life? Questions you will no doubt ask yourself. I know I have...			"

												I put off buying this game for a long time, mostly because i thought i wouldn't like it. Many of my friends & family kept pestering me to buy it, and a couple of years later i finally purchased it during one of the steam sales. After getting in a few hours of FTL, i now wish i had bought the game at launch day. It's absurdly difficult, but so wonderfully entertaining that you will keep coming back for more. I'm an absolute sucker for games with awesome soundtracks, and i fell deeply in love with FTL's beautifully soothing and atmospheric music. This game has brought me more joy and happiness than most AAA games have given me in the past decade. Faster Than Light is living proof that excellent game design more often than not, is more important than having a game with ultra high graphics and an insanely high budget.Seriously, buy this game.9.5/10			"

Although you follow the same general storyline in every play through, it still introduces new challenges and thought provoking events.  You are constantly running into issues where you have to make hard moral decisions that will affect your progress in the game.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys happiness.     12/10			"

												Beautiful game.I named my ship ""The Golden Perv"" and my crew were aptly ""Sir.Jimmy Saville"", ""Gary Glitter"" and the notorious ""Rolf Harris"". We drifted through space, far and wide. Helping those who sent distress signels are fighting tyranny wherever we found it! We were determined to finish our mission, and deliver the information (which was actually CP) to whever we had to go. We ended up crashing on a planet. We repaired our ship and rescued a man. We became good friends, sharing many jokes and rounds of ""Play Rolfs digerydoo while dancing on the table like a hooker"". We bonded. Allies. Then we were CRUELY attacked by pirates, our hull badly damaged, sheilds down and oxygen depleting. Rolf Harris and Sir Jimmy Saville tried to fix the oxygen while Gary Glitter and the man we picked up fought bravely. A missile struck the ship. Jimmy and Rolf were no more. RIP. But we fought them back and lived! Then we were ambushed yet again! This time, Gary Glitter died. The strange man had inherited the ship. He drifed. Years on end, missing his friends. Then he was stuck in an astroid belt, having the sheilds pummled by rock, while he was shot upon. The laser beams and missiles were set to auto as the strange man tried fixing the continually damage oxygen system. A fire started, and he burnt to death. Scared, alone, out of breath, and crispy is how the saga ended for The Golden Perv.			"

												This took a long while to for me to understand and appreciate.  At first I thought it to be ridiculously hard and luck driven, so I raged and uninstalled it with the intent to never play it again.  Sometime later I came across a tips and tricks thread and got a desire to play again.  I soon learned that I was playing the game poorly, and that it is not luck driven at all.  *See DarkTwinge's videos on Twitch.*  Shortly after I got my first win on easy... then my second... then my third.  I saw how fun this game can be.Then I took break from the game and forgot about it for a while.  Now that the free expansion was released, I decided to install it again and explore the content.  So I fired up a game and, 90 minutes later, I beat the game on my first try.  What a blast.If you are having a hard time with this game, please do not give up.  Take a break if you need to.  Then find why you are failing, come back, and correct the problems.  I'm glad I did because otherwise I would have missed out on really enjoying what this game has to offer.Highly recommended.			"

The main reason it's going to be hideous is because I'm not going to allow myself to delete anything I type, so this is all pretty much off the bat. :)When I first saw a trailer of this game a couple of years back, I made the mistake of thinking it'd be boring as ♥♥♥♥, I also initially found it to be that way for the tutorial, followed by the first half hour or so of gameplay... just some stupid nerdy sci-fi game where you tackle some stupid galaxy in your stupid ship with stupid lasers and stupid shield, stupid crew and stupid random ♥♥♥♥ happens all the stupid time and... hm, this game seems to have more to it than I thought, I actually like it and am a complete idiot.

												Loved it and want more. Any update would be fantastic. I guess that the mods are good to, but I'd love an official update to this game.A few things to note:You will die.You will die a lot.You will die more than you win.You can't save your progress. You die, you start over.HOWEVER:When you win, you'll be honestly proud of yourself for fighting so hard to win, because you have to do so much in order to win that you will feel like you've finished a journey or something. Either way, it's very rewarding when you win.The soundtrack is fantastic.The time between starting the game and death is random, fun, and is also never exactly the same.The side missions are fun, especially when you manage to unlock new ships. Plus the different species are interesting and sometimes game changing.The subtle lore of the game and the backstory of the different species, the cause of the war, etc.All in all, I'd recommend this game to someone who is cool-headed and loves a good old fashioned space explorer. And is willing to die.A lot.Seriously, prepare to die, and get ready to fly. Through an airlock. Or, you know, to victory.Maybe.FTL.BUY IT.			"

												""Just a few hit points on the hull, and these are the final moments of FTL. My sweaty hands press sweaty buttons as the flagship bears down upon the S.S. A-Hole. If only my Mom could see me now.""Let’s start off with the basics — FTL is a Rogue-LITE. There’s permadeath, but that’s about the only thing that really connects it to the classic concept of a rogue-like game. In fact, I think FTL is basically its own classification. I’ve never really played anything quite like it before, and it was refreshing to see a new concept on the market.Let’s talk about the pros. FTL’s gameplay is super solid. So far, I’ve come across no bugs at all, everything works as it should. The tutorial correctly explains each mechanic, and they’re each so simple that I thought at first the game would be a dud. Oh boy, how I was wrong. These simple mechanics scale into a huge atmosphere of strategy, where each move you make could decide your life or death in the final battle with the flagship. Just like in XCOM, you get attached to your crew super quickly, and when one dies it’s almost enough to rage quit. Each race manages to bring a different component to your crew, which again adds to the overall strategy.The combat relies on your micromanagement of different weapons, and your outfit in general. It’s satisfying to find a weapons strategy that destroys the enemy. Thankfully, there isn’t just ONE strategy to choose from, although they all revolve around your opponent’s shields.""One by one, my crew members are dead. The shields are down, the weapons turn orange, this is the end. But I know I just need a one more shot. I can do this.""Them cons tho.FTL does fall short in a few instances, and none bigger than the lore. If FTL could create a real world around it’s fantastic gameplay, the game would be SO MUCH BETTER. Also, the text-heavy encounters try to be physiologically difficult to decide on, but honestly it’s super easy to figure them out. Another large shortcoming is the lack of weapon variety and quest variety. Even with the expanded universe I find quests that I’ve already done and are super easy to do again with my foreknowledge. I just can’t see myself replaying this with so little variety.""One second. The weapon is charged, but so is his. They both fire.""			"

												FTL is a fantastic game that mixes elements of exploration, rogue-like event randomness, crew/ship management and survival in a perfect blend. Strategic play feels rewarded and the depth of combat rarely gets old. A variety of alien species, different ships, different layouts and random sectors/system help provide huge replay value. A winning run through the game can take up to around two hours.It is not an easy game which is both a blessing and a curse. Losing a decent run due to the RNG (random number generator) nature to some of the events you might come across as you travel to the final battle can sometimes get to you. It's worth sticking with for those good runs, even if they end in failure, that see you score high or tell an exciting story.The recent free content patch in the form of the Advanced Edition added a swathe of new features, events, ship systems and even a new race and playable ship. It has made a great game even better - even if it has also made the final boss even more frustrating and difficult!If you want to check out some first impressions of mine on the FTL Advanced Edition feel free to check out this video:

												I don't know why I love FTL that much. There's a lot of luck involved, the boss is near impossible, you quickly end up using pretty much the same tactics in every battles, and it might just be me but since most texts are more or less the same, I almost always skip them. I still find myself coming back to it again and again. Why am I doing that? Is it because of the nice atmosphere, the empowerement of commanding a crew and managing a ship into battle, the thrills of jumping from a star to another, not knowing what awaits and if I'll survive this time...Yeah, I objectively can't say why I'm in love with this game; the best I can do is to explain the feeling of adventure I get when I'm playing it.

												When single player games claim to have ""replayablity"" as a tagline, I generally roll my eyes. Usually these ""infinitely replayable"" games hold my interest for one full playthrough unless they are mind-numbingly boring or unplayably buggy, but I rarely ever start second playthrough (let alone complete one). I bought FTL at deep discount ($2.49) expecting to play through it once, kill a few hours, and get my money's worth. For once, I was incredibly suprised by a supposedly ""replayable"" game. I've spent about 30 hours on FTL, beaten the flagship once, and I'm still on the edge of my seat. There is something about the combination of true roguelike RNG and built-in replay mechanics that makes FTL something special. Though I've gotten many unlucky runs where everything seemed stacked against me, each crushing defeat felt truly unique. While FTL can be frustrating, it has never felt unfair. There is always something new to learn or try out. There is a real thrill that comes out of constructing a strategy, trying to implement it, and inevitably adapting it based on the hand you are dealt. STRONGLY RECOMMEND, even at full price.			"

												I got this game a few years ago and played a solid 25 hours making no headway because I was doing everything wrong. Over the past two weeks I picked it up again with the goal of finally winning. Took about 20 additional hours for my first (and thus far only) victory on Normal mode. I feel a lot better about reviewing it now that I've got enough hours and a victory logged. 100% recommended.You are the captain of a ship. You have to micromanage your crew and systems (weapons, shields, engines, oxygen. and piloting being the primary systems that you start with, with various systems and subsystems that differ from ship to ship or can be purchased along the way. Your goal is to explore every sector of the galaxy, progressing towards an exit beacon that propels you into the next one. You have limited time in each sector, and every jump costs one fuel. You'll often stumble across shops that let you install new weapons, hire new crew, buy new systems, buy basics like fuel and missiles, sell things you don't want anymore, and repair your ship if need be. Tons of different events that you can encounter on your travels, all having various outcomes based on your decisions. You'll make decisions or run into hostile ships after each jump with the goal being to survive long enough to upgrade your ship, get better weapons, make it to the end, and beat the final boss. That's FTL in a nutshell. Once you learn the ropes, the best ways to attack and defend, optimal ways to upgrade your ship, which events will punish you and which ones will help, you'll gradually make it further and further. On the surface the game seems completely RNG-based (and indeed, you can play perfectly and have a stretch of unlucky breaks that kill your run, or a stretch of lucky ones that win it), but the more you play, the better you get. You learn the tricks of the trade and suddenly you're relying way less on RNG and way more on your own skill.You start with one ship unlocked, and can unlock more through various quests in-game or by beating the game with other ships. There are ten ships in total, eight of which have three layouts, two of which have two. That's a grand total of 28 ships to choose from each with its own starting strengths, weaknesses, and intended playstyle. Different starting weapons and systems really shake things up. Lots of replay value.Game has three difficulties now, easy, normal, and hard. Normal is punishingly hard at times and it will take you a while to beat. You're gonna die a lot, but that's part of the fun. Even on easy mode, it's unlikely you'll be winning when you first start playing, as the game is still challenging and you stlil need to learn the ins and outs. I didn't play on easy mode even once until I had cleared normal (which happened at the 45 hour mark, but again the first 25 hours were me playing totally wrong so let's say 20), and what I learned in normal means I can win easy almost every time now, while normal is still very challenging and hard mode is completely beyond me.Captain your vessel, blow things up, die a lot, cry when your oxygen gets blown up and you suffocate from a hull breach, don't fight the giant alien spiders (they are no joke), get stranded with no fuel, go on a grand adventure, rinse and repeat until you win, cry again, and then rinse and repeat some more. That's FTL baby!			"

												The game for real gamers! There is no safety net here, each random encounter tests your spaceship management skills. In this survival strategy game, when you are dead you are perma-dead always keeping pressure on what you spend your scarce resources towards and the tactics you use in battle as you keep on the run from the Fleet in hot pursuit.Simple, challenging yet fantastically balanced gameplay keeps you coming back for ... just one more game... Ludicrous speed .. Go!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

												This game is incredible, and very challenging!  The only caveat is you have to enjoy roguelike gameplay where you build a sweet ship and then lose it all by doing something stupid.  Every time I die I learn something and come away with a new story.  For example, learning to board other ships instead of simply attacking them got me a few good stories about how I killed my crew and lost the game.  Some minor spoilers: The first time I did it, I accidentally left my ship's guns on autoattack and blew up the ship I boarded with my crew still on it.  The second time I did it, I boarded an ""auto-scout"" ship, which has no crew and therefore no oxygen, and my crew died before I could get them back.  The third time I did it I had the ship down to 1 health and didn't consider that we were in an asteroid field where it could blow up without me attacking it, and it did.  Eventually I got the hang of boarding ships and the payoff is well worth it.			"

												How did I miss writing a review for this?FTL is hands down the only rogue-like with replayability that I enjoy. You obviously don't know me so I guess that isn't saying much to you though. The game has a similar feel to XCOM:enemy unknown in its strategy system. If you rush and don't think things through, bad things will happen. And you will REALLY feel it in the long run. Unlike XCOM, playthroughs are shorter and you will learn from each mistake. The UI is beautifully done, and nearly every strategy you can come up with is viable. And it better be, because this game is HARD. I haven't personally even come close to beating the game on anything above the easiest setting. Advanced addition was an incredible update that added more to the gameplay, races, weapons, interactions, soundtrack and metagame. Everything feels even more chaotic, as you truly feel like a captain of a starship navigating in a maze of alien forces coming after your ♥♥♥. One wrong move and you're dead. One wrong move and it will cost you scrap that couldve gotten you that missle to pierce those shields you just didn't have the firepower to break through. One cheap out of repairing your health and you were one shot away from killing that drone and it kills you. One... you get the point. As stressful as it sounds, the one mistake costs you mechanics of the game give it incredible depth and replayability. Did I also mention that Advanced Edition can be turned off if you want to play the legacy version of the game? And oh yeah baby, this game has mods too. If you wanted a whole new campaign and an even bigger update than ADV edition was, Captains edition has you covered. If you just feel like adding a star destroyer as a playable ship, then whatever floats your boat.In conclusion I'm not sure what else you could possibly ask for this title. The devs have gone above and beyond the standard, and though it likely won't happen, I would absolutely love another update here in 2016. This may be an old title, but it's far from dead.Happy flying, Federation! Crush the Rebels!10/10 from me.			"

												Roguelike/lite / choose your own space adventure. Nicely designed game about your own selected crew in your own selected spaceship of which you can unlock more by progressing in the game and acchieving certain feats. The choose-your-own-adventure part of the game is nicely done, visit different nodes in space which may or may not give you loot, a challenge or progress the story a bit depending on your crew/ship/previous choices. The combat is real time with a turnbased feel to it due to the timing/cooldowns of the abilities. Beating the game for the first time might take some time, but just once you figured it all out you get a run in which you get absolutely slaughtered from the get go.The devs even released a free DLV adding a whole new race and some other mechanics to the mix. In conclusion: for the subgenre of games it's in, it's one of the best.			"

												What's a good way to sum up this roguelike spaceship simulator?Well, in one moment you could get very lucky in acquiring hefty scraps rewards, new crewmen, even say augments or weapons that give you a better chance at surviving to the end of the game. In another moment, you could be suffering the loss of a crewman through an event or be taking on the wrong kind of ship in the wrong type of environment... where you either win with heavy ship damages/casualties or lose in a very horrific fashion.See, this is FTL: Faster Than Light in a nutshell... a game where you play as a Federation Crusier on a mission back to deliver something to HQ while outrunning the Rebel Army within different sectors that has a lot things that are probably going to kill you if you're not lucky/prepared. Now much of this game revolves around a few things: luck, how well you can operate within different given situations, and what your style of ship-to-ship combat pertains to. A game like this, I feel at least, will sometimes be more luck-driven than as to how well you can handle a given situation. Of course, if you have certain augments/crewmen/weapons/etc when you arrive at some certain events, it can make traveling through the various sectors that you will come across a heck of a lot easier.Something to note: As with many roguelikes, you have to constantly stay ahead of the Rebel Army, indicated by a massive wall on your ship's radar as you jump from beacon to beacon within each sector. Now I don't think I need to say this, but it is ill advised to go straight to the exit of each sector. If you want to make it all the way to endgame, you must explore as much of the sector as possible while staying ahead of the Rebel Army before you're forced to leave the sector at the exit beacon. Doing this, you can get the most out of each sector in terms of scraps (among other things) to help upgrade your ship as well as buy weapons, augments, ship systems, and various other things from shops that you will come across.Word of warning: Make sure you plot your course through each sector thoroughly so that you will reach the exit while getting as much out the sector as possible... otherwise you may end up at dead-end points which will severely hamper your progress... or worse make you backtrack through the Rebel Fighter ships of the Rebel Army... which, to keep in mind, they do NOT mess around. Also, keep in mind of what sectors you visit... because each one has their own events, enemy ships, and hazards to deal with. Engi Sectors, for example, have ships that are bad to go against if you're particularly fond of using drones, Zoltan Sectors have you, more often than not, dealing with Zoltan Ships that have Super Shields that can't easily be bypassed with teleporters (unless you're on the Advanced Edition which offers a specific bypass augment), Mantis Sectors has you against ships that will try to board and kill off your crew, and so on and so forth.If you're lucky though, you may come across specific events that will help you in unlocking newer ships (which can alternatively be done for each one by beating the game with a specific ship)... which for some is easy to do, and others are easier said than done. Each starting ship that you unlock have different perks, advantages, etc. that can offer a different and unique experience to the game.I'm rambling at this point... so do I recommend this game? Sure, why not. If you like the notorious roguelike genre of games, I'd say go for it... it's worth the money, and you'll likely be spending hours upon hours unlocking each type of ship while taking on the different challenges that the game has to offer... while likely experiencing some frustrating difficulty spikes during gameplay.

												There's a lot I could say about this game, but I'm pretty confident that whatever I say, some other review has already covered it in depth.As such, what I can really say from myself is that FTL provides me with an immersive space adventure that's different each time; you never know for certain what's going to happen next. The ability to name your ship and each crewmember only adds to this. Sure, after playing for so long, I've seen almost every encounter type available, but when I'm playing I just feel like I'm in control of my ship and its crew, struggling to get along until the bitter end in this cruel universe. Each action has immediate consequences, and somehow making it to the end and defeating the final boss provides an extreme sense of satisfaction.Of course, this game isn't about getting to the end; it's about the journey along the way. The possibilities are endless, just like the reaches of space.... Except for the abrupt ending to your journey, which is almost certain you will die a very sudden, brutal, exploding death.			"

												The game is extremely difficult, but at the same time, the replayability and new experiance each death brings you softens the anger of the permadeath.The retention aspect of the game is top tier and the whole customization and procedural storytelling adds fantastic replayability. The game is challenging enough to make any casual player hate it though. If you hate Permadeath you will despise this game at moments.Also try playing this with a friend in Skype's Screensharing, it's actually kinda fun.			"

												I think FTL is a very addictive game ♥ You start with a crew and a ship. You have a mission to survive and there are so many ways to fail, yet so many places to explore and unpredictable events to unravel. What makes the game really fun is the decisions you make for your ship to survive and your strategy of micro-managing your crew, situations and resources in order to make it to your goal. Depending on the roles you give to each crew member will also depend which skills and strengths they develop.There are some interesting species to encounter and play as in FTL, from fireproof rockmen to telepathic slugs. The random name generation is quite amusing too.As a roguelike game, this means there is no mercy if you die and your ship explodes. Failling means the end and you will need to start all over again. The feeling is bad, but the desire to play again is always there, just to see if luck is in your hands next time.Also, you can unlock ships, in-game achivements and layouts if you do keep playing over again, depending on what you encounter and how far you get.Sometimes when played for too long with the same ship and crew, it's easy to become attached to the crew members. RIP Charlie :(I think those of you who ♥ sci-fi, challenging, strategic and resourceful survival games will really enjoy and play FTL over and over again. ♥ "

Recommended: FTL is a game that is intentionally punishing in the end fight, but irrespective of that, the journey to said end fight is often quite fun.  There is perhaps an over-reliance on procedural generation that can make the game overly inconsistent in difficulty, but to many, that's the appeal.  At it's heart, FTL is a simple space tactical game that uses it's rogue-like elements with decent proficiency to create that often-sought ""just one more game"" replayability.  It's not going to sell someone new to rogue-likes, I don't think, but it is well worth a look for fans of the genre.Read the full review on Highland Arrow here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												I think the best part of strategy games is often learning how everything works and interacts and actually experiencing the learning curve first hand. It can be frustrating because you'll die because of something you didn't know about- but you remember it for next time and forge ahead and slowly climb the ranks.FTL is excellent at this process. I've died in this game more than I've died in just about any other game and I've barely been playing it over more than a few months, but rather than getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and ragequitting I'm encouraged to try something new, to adjust my upgrade order, to select a different interaction with a ship, to mix up my weapons or combat technique or any number of different approaches to avoid or deal with the same problem in the future.It's a game that relies on RNG heavily, which normally makes for a really boring end game, but with FTL there's tons of end-game content and once you think you've learned everything and mastered the intricacies of turns, combat, crew members, upgrades and everything else there's still a heap of goals to strive for, new challenges to attempt and things to do.It's a fantastic game that never makes me feel rushed, and in those moments when I do feel pressured because I'm losing it's alright because I know I can adapt and try things a little different next time and get just a little bit better and a little bit further.

												Don't judge my review from the amount of hours on Steam. I've been playing FTL on the iPad since last year.Here's what I have to say.10 reasons for a 10/101. Dying over and over again, many times is the game. Unless you win the final fight.2. You will see giant alien spiders atleast once in every playthrough.(what I mean is you reach sector 8) Always reject them unless you have a clone bay.3. Ship layout doesn't always guarantee victory(even you Mantis B and Crystal B)4. Unlocking the Crystal ship is like winning the lottery. Match all three encounters and you win the prize.5. The game's soundtrack fits the game's theme perfectly, starting as a calm track; then becoming faster as you get into a fight.6. If you're surviving, you'll die. If you're thriving, you will die. If you're lucky, you'll win.7.  Boarding with 4 mantis/2 crystal & 2 mantis/4 rockmen with fire is extremely fun! Getting boarded, isn't.8. I love how stupidly powerful/stupid/powerful the enemy ships are. I wonder if they fixed the 5 shielded auto ship.9. The euphoria, ecstacy when winning a game will outweigh all of the times you lost before then.10.  Modding is extremely fun. Especially Captain's Edition, ship mods, and graphics mods.Those are ten decent reasons to buy FTL.P.S. ion intruders, ♥♥♥♥ off			"

												I'm not a fan of Star Trek or Star Wars, but I still love this game. It's very immersive and it really makes you feel like a captain of a space ship. Each new playthrough is random and full of interesting decision making and different tactics. Every time you restart the game it's a new adventure. Perfect for roleplaying.			"

The sound effects, the music and the game concept is all beautifully interwoven together and combine to make a really addicting game.And this is the first time I've ever used the word ""Interwoven"", AND the first game I've ever recommend with a review.

												FTL: Faster Than Light. A gloriously simple, yet complex game. This is a top-down rogue-like that simulates the experiences of managing a crew on your own spaceship in a futuristic setting. It was initially released on the 14th of September back in 2012 and is currently on sale for £6.99 or $9.99 on Steam.Chances are, if you’re into Sci-Fi, Strategy or Rogue-likes and you play on Steam. Then you’ve seen or heard of this game. It was also massively popularised by YouTubers such as Nerd3 and TotalBiscuit. And if you haven't, then you're actually missing out on quite a lot. The premise of the game, is that you control a crew of different races in different ships as you try to flee from the ongoing Rebellion and complete your mission for the Galactic Federation.One of the most notable things about the game is it's easily recognisable Indie and Pixely design which seems to give an Arcade or Retro feel without limiting the game to such a style entirely. However the design still feels exclusively (and entirely) it's own, although their is a definite feel of inspiration from games such as Spelunky, X-Com and the classic board game of Battleships.One of my favourite additions to the game would have to be it’s free expansion pack: “FTL:AE (Advanced Edition)”. This added a whole new series of Ship Classes, weapons, events, augments and a whole new race.If you do intend to play this game, then be warned: If you find yourself enjoying this game, then you will soon find it incredibly addicting and infuriating, terrifying and heart-breaking. However one of the biggest falls to this game is how quickly the use of RNG becomes an annoying sensation of ""Copy and Paste"" and the repetitive feelness of the same scenarios occurring time after time.In Summary;This game is a must get. Even if you aren’t a fan of rogue-likes or micro-managing in games, I would still recommend this. The gameplay is innovative and the design is immersive in it’s own 2D way. The variety of mod's and achievements/unlockables also make this game so replayable that at times, it almost becomes second-nature. It's only downsides are it's difficult gameplay and at times it's repetitiveness...Pro's:- Detailed & Beautiful Pixel Graphics- Beautiful Soundtrack (2 Hours Long)- Unique Gameplay- Variety in Freedom of Choice- Good Modding CommunityCon's:- Repetitive Gameplay- Insane Difficulty Curves- Overly Addictive & Infuriating9.5/10			"

												The good: Random, roguelike play, text based rpg aspects, no two games are alike. Unlocks, and varations on how you set up your ships (I don't mean the layouts but after you start) lead to much replayability. The bad: The game does everything it can to make you miserable and or lose. Before the expansion this was also true but not quite so vehemently. The end boss even on easy is impossible for me but apparently some people have solved it. After 64 hours I am giving up on it. Even with Advanced mode off the game is 10x harder than it was. Getting near my scores of several years ago is severely challenging in a bad way. Sometimes it feels like a run through is a complete waste of time. The ugly: What do you want for cheap? The game is too hard for people who aren't willing to dedicate their lives to solving it. I suspect being under 40 years old helps (because lets face it us old folks just aren't as 'smart' as we used to be.) And having the patience of job probably doesn't hurt either. The game has no frills graphics which I like but may be unexciting for those raised on MMOs and fancy gizmos. Overall: There is plenty of fun in it and I would recommend it for anyone who doesn't mind losing. All the time. Where you lose in the game will vary and much of the time it won't seem like you have much control over it. Even if you are great at multitasking and micromanaging the challenges are insurmountable. This is the nature of Rogue's descendents. Even those set in space. Except for the ones that are more 'like-lite' than 'like'.As they say the meaning is in the journey not in the destination so play it and revel in the many fiery deaths you get to experience. Unlocking ships is a mini game that can be fun if you get very lucky. I've managed 4 in 4 years so hey. Advanced edition offers more things to confound, amuse and mystify you. (New races, items, ships, etc)Don't be embarrassed to play on easy and don't forget to look for help because the game is designed to be ultra hard even on the easy mode. (There are people who will need to show their epine by claiming otherwise but ignore them. The truth is you learn in baby steps and die repeatedly, horribly and without mercy. You do get to do pretty mean things to others while doing so, so there is that.)Especially learn what the basics of the game are and then learn the basic 'no nos' because that will get you pretty far. Sector 8 is not hard to get to (though intact may be a different story) once you've managed to get to sector 5 which is not hard to get to once you learn how to get through sectors without being blown randomly. And then you get to learn how to die to the Rebel Flagship. If not in the first battle then in the next or the last. Only the lucky and skillful survive the final battle. I am neither so far.			"

												A great spaceship RPG / combat sim with strong strategy elements and an old school feel. The graphics are 2D and a bit basic, but the gameplay will definitely grasp you from the first minutes.

												This game is a FireFly simulator (you haven't watch it?! Begone, vilespawn!). You need to manage resource in a small spaceship on it's journey to impending doom. It seem simple at first, but the first minute you died, you will be angry and want to try again. But yet, you will fail again, many times, and times again. The control, gameplay, balance is crafted to perfection, don't be deceived by the simple graphic (is not pixel base, thank God), the graphic is what you want in this hectic, frenzy, chaotic game. You maybe want to spend just an half an hour, but before you three hours has passed. So be very careful my friend, because this is more than you ever wanted.			"

												Captain's Log, Stardate -309538.54318873666We have just departed the Federation base and the crew is optimistic about our chances, despite the fact that we have literally the entire Rebel fleet just a few light years behind us. We're passing an asteroid field and have decided to investigate it for resources that may aid in our journey. Captain out.And so begins your journey in FTL, where you, a lone ship, needs to cross to the far side of the galaxy to deliver important schematics regarding a superweapon the Rebels have constructed, and which you'll face in combat in the final sector. Sound familiar? It should, because FTL is a game meant to evoke memories of all those times you imagined being a starship captain, and placing you in control of everything from the crew's roles to where power is being allocated.In the grand tradition of Baldur's Gate, the game also features real-time-with-pause, which you'll need to use when everything starts exploding, catching on fire or being boarded by a killer robot. There's a bevy of ships to unlock (many of which bear an uncanny resemblence to famous sci-fi vessels like the SSV Normandy), each of which also has a variant that plays in very different ways, and since the game itself isn't very long, it's been designed for tremendous replay value. And you will get a LOT of that, since it's also punishingly hard, yet generally fair in how it kills youOf course, sometimes the RNG is merciless and you're dead within the first few minutes, but there's something about this game which makes you just want to click New Game again and go for it once more.Beacon destination set. Preparing to jump to light speed. Engage!			"

												This is one of my favourite games of all time. It has a lot of replayability, customisation and is very quirky. The art is amazing and detailed with no big flashy graphics. The soundtrack is also really cool and adds to the game. The Glaive Beam is soooooooooooo good, one-shotting a ship is so much fun. There is so much choice on how you play, which can give you better options for the encounters. I'd definitely recommend this game, 12/10. Final note: Giant alien spiders may cause rage quits.

												FTL is the single most frustrating game that I have ever played and I love it. No two games are ever the same. No matter how hard you try to duplicate that near perfect run, something will happen to make it vastly different from before. I'll just use the setup I killed the Mothership on, what's that? Dead in Sector 1? RAGEQUIT! Only, every time I do 'ragequit' I restart the game. I just can't get away from it. It's gravitational pull is too strong! (Hey look, a space joke. Go me!) FTL is nothing short of a modern day masterpiece. It's one of the very few games that I could listen to a soundtrack of again and again. I will show this game to my children, and they will die. I'm not very good at picking favourites, I have a very changeable personality and bounce around a lot. Saying that, a game would have to be rather incredible to even be considered in the same breath as FTL.			"

												Well, I just picked this game up a few days ago during the 2016 Steam Summer sale for 3 bucks. The first time I loaded it up, by the time I stopped I had over 13 hours played. That's how quickly this game hooked me. I just couldn't put it down. It's not possible to better spend 3 dollars!I didn't beat the game until about 19 hours played (on normal difficulty). I pride myself at being well above average at most video games so when this game posed this much of a challenge for me to beat just the one time, I felt a real sense of accomplishment.For new players thinking of getting this game, you have to understand that this game is very difficult. If you don't want to experience the frustration of dying your way through learning the basics repeatedly, you may want to invest the time to read a few guides, pull up the wiki and/or watch a few Youtube videos giving you some pointers and tips. That being said, I personally refrained from reading/watching any guides myself and while things were frustrating at times, learning the game firsthand this way was an extremely rewarding experience. I just know that not all gamers are like me and I'd hate to see someone quit this amazing game prematurely due to the frustration that learning it can cause.The game is not without fault though. While it's difficulty is one of it's primary attractions, it's also one of it's most apparent weaknesses. There are times this game is so punishing that it borders on the unfair.As good as this game is, great even, it requires a fair amount of luck. IMO, this is a fault. It may be better phrased that you have to avoid being unlucky. What I mean by this is, the game hinges on quite a bit of RNG. This RNG can be the difference between you becoming a Space God or you literally being so weak the game becomes unwinnable. Here's what I mean...Now I'll stipulate that this was fairly early on for me and I was very much still learning, but I played one game where I managed to get far enough into the game without being offered anything in the way of weapon upgrades that I literally could not destroy the enemy ships I was fighting against. With the default arsenal you're provided, it was not possible for me to win. I went through three entire sectors (fairly large chunks of the game) looking for a new weapon and found none. This is what I mean by having to avoid being unlucky, because due to the procedural nature of the game, while this is exceptionally uncommon, it's quite possible for the game to simply not give you the tools to actually win, forcing you to start over. Now while I've had my fair share of unlucky runs, this was the only run where I felt there was literally no chance at all for victory.Otherwise, expect this game to be like other procedural games where you'll have really great runs where the game gives you everything and bad runs where you're struggling to stay afloat. This is not in of itself a bad thing as it becomes very fun and FTL pulls it of beautifully. So beautifully that it becomes quite addicting. Starting a brand-new game and not knowing what wonders are in store for you this time or what horrors are bound to beset you and your crew is just an intoxicating experience that will enchant you from start to finish. And while this game will be frustrating at times, starting over from scratch almost immediately washes away any lingering adverse emotions the previous run may have left as you set out again, confident that during this new run, things are going to be different!

												I have never played another game that's been quite as immersive as FTL. If you haven't played it, you might dismiss it as some overly complex 2d strategy game that you'll never get the hang of and quit in frustration. Trust me, it's more than that. You assume the role of captain on your very own starship, which you're able to build on and customize as you go. Sounds easy enough, right? Nope. After travelling through beautiful and randomly generated galaxies with your loyal crew, the soundtrack will permeate your soul and appeal to your adventureous side just a tad too much. You'll make a command blunder and lose part or all of your crew who, by this point, feel like family. You'll be lucky to escape with anyone at all. You'll lie awake at night, kicking yourself for your moment of indescretion. You'll run through all the options that you could have taken but failed to do so. Eventually, you'll come to terms with your grief and return to the game to start over. Maybe things will go better for you this time. In time, you'll become a battle-hardened leader with a strategy and a passion for victory.Being a fan of Star Trek, nothing else has better helped me to feel the pressures and uncertainties faced by Kirk and Picard. This game practically generates Star Trek plots for you to tell your friends (and perhaps embellish the truth to make you look like you knew what you were doing facing those Mantis instead of fleeing). This is my favorite game and it's a true masterpiece. I highly recommend it. "

												A game that honestly looks pretty confusing, but is actually really easy and fun to pick up. Although the tutorial will have you stumble along as you blindly try to remember what each and every little system and sub-system does, once you get started the game becomes really easy to learn. That is, until you really start getting into it.Although at first you may be finding yourself dominating any ship that comes in your path, because of your beautiful, marvelous, non-AI brain, you'll be quickly fighting ships that, if exercise is not cautioned, will ♥♥♥♥ you up. Easy mode is probably what I'd start on first, since normal might as well be called ""No-forgiveness mode"".Despite the difficulty itself, the events and scenarios that the game will throw at you are varied and hard to avoid. Sometimes you'll have to fly through Nebulas where you're sensors will be effected, thus not allowing you to monitor your whole ship (or the enemies), you may think ""How is it a big deal if I can't see inside some parts of my ship?"" Well, smart guy/girl, if the opposing ship hits your ship, and causes a fire, you won't know where it is unless if you have a crew member in the room where the fire started, -OR- the opposing ship could beam its crew onto your ship, and they can go march about within your ship, tearing it apart from the inside and out, all while you fight an enemy spaceship.Speaking of crew, you start out with three crew members, and can get more at any point in the game. They can man various systems to improve their performance, put out fires, fix broken/destroyed systems, and, with a teleporter, can be beamed on the enemy ship to wreck havoc. I could go on about how great this game is, but in short: Go and buy it.			"

												I would highly recommend this to anybody who enjoys a good strategy game. After you learn the basics and all, It can become very, VERY, addicting. The day i bought it i spent 7 hours on it. Overall, Great game IMO. 9/0 would buy again.EDIT: After about another 3 hours, I feel I should add on to the review. The game is difficult and I almost guarantee you will not beat it in your first playthroughs. The goal of the game is to explore different areas of the map as the rebel fleet is chasing you. There are 3 types of the map. Nebulas, Civilian, and Hostile. Nebulas are areas of the map that block out your sensors, disabling you to see in areas of the ship that your crew isn't in. Nebulas will slow down the rebel fleet, but are difficult to traverse. Civilian areas are areas of the map that are mostly poulated by civilians. There are pirates here, so don't be stupid. I find plenty of merchants in this area so it is a good area to restock and repair. Hostile areas are areas mostly controled by hostiles, obviously. You can expect to battle nearly every checkpoint you travel to. Watch your hull, and make sure you repair it whenever you can. I hope this helps. If you have a question either comment on my profile or comment on the review.			"

												I have yet to find a game as finely balanced as FTL.  370 hours in and I'm still learning new strategies, and still struggling to do well on the game's normal difficulty.  It is rare to find a game that can still surprise me as often as this one does.  Yesterday I had the best ship and crew that I've ever put together, to a point where I was sure I'd breeze through to the end and curbstomp the final ship.  I died hard and fast to a lightweight ship that got the better of me because I decided to turn off my Vulcan canon and teleport over to their ship to finish them off.  I watched my beautiful perfect run fall apart, and saw my ship disintegrate.  My failure was complete.  I started a new game immediately.  I am addicted in the most wonderful way.			"

												FTL could have been the ultimate bada.s.s. Star Trek game. The game draws inspiration from this franchise but is not a rip-off at all. It has enough style and lore by itself. I'll be brief: graphics are good, music is too (love how themes change when you enter battle mode - it's the same theme only more tense), story is made up by you - a rouge-like experience where no game session is similar. BUT! One word:  gameplay . It is so damn deep and addictive! I loose several hours in a row in it though I don't usually play a video game too long in one session. Battle system is especially awesome. It's of a sheer joy to participate in tactical exchange between two starships: you control systems and subsystems, fix damaged ones, choose the right time to fire different weapons, harass the enemy with combat drones... It feels like gold to break enemy's shields and then cut their hull with laser! FTL got different unique races, augmentations, unlockable ships... Advanced Edition which came out in April of 2014 added to the gameplay a lot - new features, races, updated hud. Hard to believe it was free too. Game is an absolute must-own for sci-fi fans. Everyone else, buy it too!			"

												Space fans prepare yourself for another great game! FTL is a 2D, space adventure game where you carry information that is vital for the Federation. Your mission is to survive and travel to the Federation base and pass on the info before you die. On your journey you encounter pirates, rebels, mercernaries, slave traders, shops, and various races of aliens as well as the common humans. You can outfit your ship with different systems and technology that have different uses and provide different strategies. E.g ion weapons disable sytems for a short time, beam weapons damage multiple targets and rockets/bombs ignore shields. Different races have advantages too, so choose ones that suit you, some have exceptional engineering skills, others have better combat skills. All in all, the game is great fun and even if you're not into space games give it a chance. It'll surprise you, you'll be determined to make it to the end and unlock all of the ships. As a bonus it has a free DLC that comes with it so be sure to give it a try. 10 out of 10 would shoot lasers again and also 10 out of 10 would watch Star Wars again. :D			"

												Well..it's not easy to give this game a definite ""yay"" or ""nay"". It's challenging and may be frustrating for those who seek sunday entertainment. For me it was definitely a satisfying experience - the one when the game pisses you off just enough to think ""I'll show them next time!"" :)It is a rogue like space-captain simulator where you take command of a spaceship with a very important mission that can save the galaxy far far away. You need to upgrade your ships subsystems and be clever about it! Space scrap you gather will only suffice for some upgrades and those define the way you tackle your opponents so.. be smart, be experienced and don't be discouraged by some early failures... The game is worth it :)			"

You shouldn't be deterred by the difficulty, once you learn the ropes of the game, you'll spend hours jumping from beacon to beacon, trying to outrun the Rebel fleet.

												Before you try this game, here are a couple facts regarding FTL:FTL does not like you. FTL does not want to be your friend. FTL would love nothing more than to push you down the stairs and ruin your perfectly good day and kick you when you're trying to get back up, because that's just what FTL does for fun.The game is basically Oregon Trail in space. Except you also have to defend yourself against enemy spaceships shooting at you, and outrun a gigantic rebel army, and decide what to use your limited scrap pieces for, and deal with your sensors being down in this nebula and oh god the fire is spreading to other rooms in my ship but I can't open the air locks because my oxygen system is damaged and the enemy jammed my weapons where did these intruders come from crap did my pilot just die son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ and I was almost at the exit beacon too			"

												Human mind can barely understand how something so simple as FTL can still be so ingredibly complex and fun. If you are a fan of science fiction series like Star trek: TNG, Babylon 5, Stargate, etc. You will be addicted right away. You really feel like being a captain of your ship and you have to make decisions with the knowledge you have at a time. Things can really turn upside down just after the next FTL-jump.You can't describe the intense you got while playing this game.Tough sacrifices and narrow escapes of certain death are always part of your journey as you carry on the mission. Worthy experience to anyone who is able to learn from mistakes and won't give up easily.edit: nominated for steam awards 2016.10 - Perfect game9 - Excelent game, best of the genre8 - Good game, worth your time7 - Average game, nothing really special6 - Bad game, avoid5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time4 - Failed game, unpayable			"

												Completing a game of FTL is a satisfying victory I feel every self-respecting person should experience at least once. I thought that after I had beat the game one time, I would be done with it and move on to something else. That was not the case. I had continued to play the game over and over, trying to beat it with every ship and I had found myself even re-using ships I'd already beaten the game with. Simply put, the game has great replay-value.After 100 hours of playing this game, FTL had become one of my all time favorite games. Some compare its gameplay to that of a rougelike, due to an incidental and randomized journey through space and of course: perma-death. However I'd say the game is too unique to be classified under any one genre, but it's definitely an exciting game of strategy and survival.The game can be played at your own pace due to being able to pause and queue up commands at your own leisure, or it can be played as a brutally-challenging action-game that requires quick decisions. Even if you play the game slowly, it's still very difficult. The dastardly nature of the game makes it feel like all odds are against you and the only way to win is through sheer luck, but that is in fact not the case, as an experienced FTL player can beat the game (destroying the Flagship) consistently as long as they are careful and make the right choices. I've even wrote a detailed guide explaining this further.Although the game play is simple in concept, you'll notice it is fairly in-depth. You command a cruiser with up to 8 people on board, ranging from humans to alien bugs to rockmen -- each with their own unique traits and stats; i.e. Rockmen are slow, hard to kill and immune to fire while Humans' unique trait is being ""boring"". When you encounter an enemy cruiser, you must destroy their ship, flee or, when given the opportunity: negotiate. You have an arsenal of offensive options at your disposal such as weapons, drones, or boarding-crew. Additionally you have an entire ship of units to individually control in order to man certain parts of the ship (such as Pilot or Weapons room), repair broken systems, extinguish fires or fight off invaders. At it's simplest level, you're basically just shooting a laser at the enemy's ship until he blows up. At it's most complex level... you're actively using your Cloaking system to dodge enemy missiles, teleporting your crew onto the enemy ship to kill their pilot and disable their shield systems, carefully micromanaging your boarders so they don't die, lining up a salvo of lasers and beam weapons so they hit the enemy ship in rapid succession for maximum effectiveness, moving your engineer to repair one of your systems while you micromanage the blast-doors on your ship to extinguish fires and stop enemy boarders from approaching your weapons room. FTL's game play has a lot of depth and variety.And finally, the aesthetics. The visuals are simple and beautiful, it's got this sort of retro feel to it and everything is crisp and well-designed. The soundtrack is incredible, too, and even after 100 hours I still find myself nodding my head to the music and enjoying the overall atmospheric feel of the soundtrack.So to summarize: the game is amazing, challenging, has a lot of replay value, great aesthetics, and is definitely worth the $10.

												Let me start by addressing some of the complaints about this games such as it being all based on luck and how it lacks content. There is a huge amount, I would even go as far as saying an equal amount of strategy to this game as there is luck. From what you buy, to if you decide to buy anything at all and instead choose to upgrade your ship giving it that extra fire power or hiding behind your many layers of shields. There are so many different ways of playing this game and a large amount of content if you bother to use it. You are able to unlock new ships and new set ups from completing runs and unlocking achievements along the way giving you an insentive to beat the unbeatable. This game is for the people who are prepared to get frustrated, pull out their hair, quit the game and then come back to it the next day with a fresh mindset and with the hunger to get further each time, learning more and more with every click of the start button. I have heard many times that the game is unfair and too one sided, let me just say ""You is mad, cus You is bad"".I think its more than fair to say a large proportion of the game will come down to luck and finding either exactly what you need at a shop/encounter or you finding useless items not worth the jump taken to get there. For me this adds to the challenge and gives the game more depth, without it there would be less need for exploration of a star system and a lack of increasing intensity that you might not find a shop before you run out of fuel or needed items. If you were able to jump to a shop and have the full range of items from the game to choose from then this game would be a breeze. If you land at a shop and find the useless crap we all dread to stumble upon after jumping strategicly to the only shop visible then move on! Discover another shop. There are multiple shops per star system it just takes planning and insightful purchases to easily discover most of the map before moving on. However this game is not all based on random blind luck and any one that tells you so well...... I question their inteligence and so should you. This game has been built for replayability and the challenge that comes with it. Of course if you decide to send you crew down to a planet to help survivors there is a good chance they will not come back..... so dont!. If you rescue a crazy man from a pod or planet DONT take him on board. ""If you avoid risky encounters then you survive risky encounters"". That is a phrase that should be forced upon people when they start up the game. As for the lack of content....... well I have to say that I haven't encountered this as a problem. I understand the feeling of getting to the final boss with an almost perfect ship, defeating him and not being able to help but want to carry on. Surely this in its self proves that the game has been entertaining though. In my eyes if I come to the end of a movie and I am left wanting more then surely that movie was a success and made me feel exactly how it should have. Going back to pure content, I have played this game and have gone through so many runs of it. Obviously I have my favourite set up that I tend to repeat and replicate from time to time to beat the boss or at least see if I can get that far, but there are so many different ways you can play the game. There are so many different set ups to choose from and the thing is.... its all up to you. There was FREE DLC content that added even more if you thought there wasnt enough in the game, but beware it makes it more of a challenge.p.s. Avoid the nebula!			"

												SPAAAAACE!!! No seriously, this game rocks asteroids. Adventure, micro-management, combat, strategy, everything is as polished as a Naboo Starfighter. There is a real sense of progression and achievement as you conquer increasingly difficult galaxies while building up the strength of your ship and crew. Combat is smart and relies not only on your current build but also on your ability to adapt your tactics to the current situation. FTL being a rogue-like there is also a bit of luck involved, but I didn't find that frustrating as randomness in FTL creates a sense of tension and helplessness that adds a lot to the atmosphere. All in all, FTL is a great game that's easy to understand but challenging to master and you'll enjoy every last bit of it, slugs, zoltans and all!			"

												An ever-changing game experience, with random events, numerous hidden storylines, and difficult-to-get unlockables makes the replay value on this game high and mighty. One could spend months, years at a time playing through FTL, and like a snowflake, never run into a repeat. That, coupled with the game's creative and beautiful collection of stories, artwork, and music makes for one of the greatest experiences anyone could hope to witness from even the best of this century's newest games. The undeniable beauty makes the pain of losing bearable... The infinite choices gives you hope that you can avoid it... And the rare but unequaled sensation of self-fulfillment makes it all worth that one extra try. A true masterpiece.			"

												FTL: Faster than Light is a modern first person shooter set in the pre-historic era. Players team up with familiar faces such as Yoda from Cooking Mama: Hitler's Revenge, Dark Magician Girl from The Eldar Scrools: Minecraft, Kobe Bryant from Sleep Simulator 1966 and Cicero from Octodad: Ninja Warrior to battle against the evil forces of the Australian Government.The main protagonist, Scratch Cat (Voiced by Dwayne Cena), leads his team of up to 7 cultists through Customs and Border Security as they try to free the Jewish slaves from the clutches of the Pharaoh with the help of Mike Tyson and the Duke of Deception whilst saving Christmas and trying to find Wally. The varying enemy types really brighten the song up as they provide the driver with new challenges at each turn. Personally, my favorite boss battle is the very first one against The Dynamic Duo; Sir. Lynch III and Dr. Breen where players are forced to endure being called an embarrassment for a whole month. A few negatives that I have about the game are that there aren't a lot of choices on the menu and the water is too cold. These may be only minor things that may only affect some people but I feel that it is important that I identify these things.Something that I feel I should point out to anyone interested in this recipe is that the PvP aspect of the game can be very challenging and confusing to newcomers of the country. Though being a FPS, the LoL PvP suddenly changes the game into an open world MMORPG where monkeys rule the earth. This sudden change has been reported to give trees cancer and thus, caution should be taken when accessing the PvP feature under the sea.All in all, Fire Emblem: Awakening is a really well developed game with a passionate dev team. The car has great performance, gameplay, visuals and add a dash of salt to seal the deal. I really enjoyed my first lap and I feel as if many other would too. I give Watch Doge: New Vegas a score of 32.33 uh, repeating of course chicken nuggers out of 10.			"

												Cute, little rogue-like spaceship sim game.The role is simple, fly on the other side of galaxy map to warn your fleet about upcoming rebel invasion and it's weaknesses.Flying through 8 sectors, each containing many systems you have to hold on and maintain many encounters of enemies, random events and threats by space phenomena.Given yourself the ship of your choice, you can upgrade and set pretty much anything giving you so large options of Micromanagement. From manning the ship systems with your crew to weapons, shields, drones and ship's energy power distribution. During combats you can also pause the game any moment, thinking and planning your moves ahead which comes handy in most of the chaotic situations.Destroying enemy ships provides you with gear and scrap for which you can buy better stuff in Stores scattered over the space. Not only by simply destroying enemy ships you get victorious, you can also either disable their life support systems or send in the Assault team both resulting in killing the enemy crew, giving you much more rewards.Getting through the game makes you unlock more new ships or their new weapon/system/crew layouts after successfully completing achievements with each of them. Can you save yourself while getting through the space with Rebel fleet chasing your tail making you not to stop for long in each sector?Personally I am not much of a fan of Rogue like games but this one can be hard, fun and still mannageable at once.TL;DR -> 8,5/10, Would buy again.

FTL: Faster Than Light – Avanced Edition is a space tactical adventure game. Travel across a series of star systems, surviving friendly or deadly encounters along your way, upgrading your equipment and accomplishing various quests. But time runs short as you are pursued by the rebel fleet, and only by making it to the last system quickly enough do you stand any chance of saving the Federation.Pros: This game has plenty of replayability. You have series of systems to fly through, and in each case a selection of branching paths, making each playthrough different. There is a bunch of accomplishments that unlock alternative ship designs. You can select your crew, depending on your starting ship species, from people you save, make deal for slaves of hire people on space stations, and your crew will get experienced in whatever they are tasked at doing. You have a limited amount of upgrades you can add to your ship, making where you apply these upgrades a critical decision on the type and quantity of equipment you can have and use.Cons: I've said it before, but retro graphics just aren't my thing, and I'll leave it at that. The game doesn't allow you enough time to explore as much as you'd like to, as time is always a factor and you just have so many warp points you can travel to before you're caught up by the enemy fleet. Rooms are all pre-assigned, so you can't chose where to install your systems when you upgrade your ship: there's a pre-determined room in which it goes no matter what your defense strategy in case of boarding may be.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youIf you don't mind the graphics (or even enjoy them) and enjoy a simplified rogue-like challenge, this game may be for you. It's exactly what it's advertising to be, so if the game seems interesting to you, it probably will be.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												FTL where to begin it's one of my favorite games of all time. the thing about it is people complain it's hard because of RNG and other means that can't be controlled. people say it's ""too hard"" or ""i wish there was a Legit save feature"" but IT'S A ROUGE TYPE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HARD THERE ARE ""RUNS"" NOT SAVES MEANING IT'S MEANT FOR A ONE TIME TRY THEN RESTART.(SIDE-NOTE I'm going to guess that if i go to say the binding of isaac area it will be the same thing about the game being hard) for anyone getting ready  to buy this game look at guides play a little before reading guides some of the guides may invalid here soon because of the update coming up but it's worth looking at the guides. (most of the update seems to be more end game content.) but overall i suggest buying FTL but if you don't like dying over and over without hard saves or luck based events than i woould stray away from this game and other rouge types			"

												One moment your ship is fine the next you have a populated force scanning your crew and you find out that your crew member has commited villany crimes.You will be traveling through space when you stumble across a space pirate who attacks and then surrenders,in return gives you a slave.You can have robots to protect your ship or drones too.You can hire aliens to be part of your crew.You could come too close to a solar flare and your ship starts to burn.Your oxygen room is hit by a laser and then your crew starts to choke.You get a pirate asking you to hand over you crew or they will destroy you.You can choose multiple ships and customize your crew.You can have different ship layouts.Everytime you start a new adventure the place you visit in randomly generated so it is always new.There is so much to do and so much to unlock and it will take ages to explore the adventures you will endure with Faster Than Light.I couldn't recommend enough as even I was scared it was not worth my money and that I could find a better game for my moneys worth.If you like Star Wars,Star Trek,Mass Effect,Halo,Space,Planets,Aliens,Robots,Drones,Space Pirates,Space Ships,Random events,Lots of content,Awesome music,Good Mods,Powerful weapons and anything Sci-fi or anything like I just said then you owe it to yourself to buy this brilliant game.10/10 "

												What an awesome game!When you start it for the first time it's a little confusing, you don't know what the systems do, what you tripulation is good for, what the best upgrades are and how to spend your money smartly.Your first 2 to 3 hours will be spend learning all this, and dying, you will die alright, you will die a thousand times in a thousand different ways.You´ll get so close to finishing the game, and you´ll scream every time the final boss will destroy you for a very small miscaculation.Finally after putting more than 20 hours I can finish the game most times I try, and every time is different and challenging, everytime I unlock new ships and things to do.I recommend starting with the regular edition and getting to the special edition features after the first time you can finish the game.In short, the game is super well designed, dying in space has never been so fun!

												Faster Than Light is one of my favourite games on Steam.The premise of the game is that you are a memeber of ""The Federation"" and you have valuable information against a group of Rebels which have fragmented The Federation in a war. You and your crew jumps from Beacon to Beacon, from sector to sector, until you reach the 8th - and last sector, where you fight the rebel Flagship.The game plays well, with there being many different options to suit your playstyle. There are atleast 6 species of the Galaxy that can join your crew, ranging from Mantis Insectoids to Crystal men. There are many upgrades that allow you to improve you ships firepower and overall stats - some of which are upgrades for how much power your Reactor and sytems take in and can hold.FTL can be very unforgiving, however it is relatively fair in how it throws you into situations. Many times it's a product of your own doing. Except for the Space Spiders. Never trust the space spiders.Combat consists of your crew powering up the weapons systems and then targeting parts of the enemy ship. It is very satisfying and is executed excellently. It is fun to play and very strategic (hint: press Spacebar to pause, you'll need it) whilst being easy to access for new players. Hitting systems can cause a variety of things that will turn the odds in your favour. The enemies can also do these things to you too, so it can screw you over too. There are sometimes options for you to let your enemies live, in exchange for goods. You can choose to take this offer and show mercy, or kill them. These are ""events"" and happen throughout the game. Events help you to gather scrap and get special upgrades and ships. These were rather well done and are very high quality, with a huge amount of variety between them.I think this is a must have. FTL is very satisfying, with a huge a amount of replayability. There is a vast amount of content, and there is even more to come with FTL: Advanced Edition which is free to any Faster Than Light owner.			"

 Space fighting awesomenessThis is, with no doubt, a game that by far didn't live up to my expectations. It exceeded my expectations, it suprised me in every way, positively. It is a 2D game, but more emmersive than most games I ever played. Battlefield, Bioshock, Arma , Crysis; all top-notch, high end, GPU busting games, FTL communicated the athmosphere to me in the best way. There is a reason you can buy the soundtrack seperatly on Steam, it's in complete synchronisation with the genre of the game. Every run you make in the game is different, every run has got it's good moments, but also moments where you become so annoyed you could smash you keyboard in half. You unlock, discover, and think with this game, it grasps your attention, and doesn't let go untill you finish the run. Add the AE update on top of this all, bringing FREE extra content to the community, and you've got yourself a classic. Try to name games who bring the same kind of content nowaday, and are actually fully caring about the community. I'm extremely satisfied with this game, and it was one of the best purchases I ever made in gaming. It is an experience you don't want to miss. I recommend you spend that 10 euros/dollars, or less when it's on sale, it's worth every single cent. And yes, I'm a fanboy now.			"

												I get bored with games very easily. However, I have not gotten bored with this one yet. There are so many ships to unlock, achievements to be gotten, and best of all, the game changes each time you play. Many people say this game relies on luck, and it does, but I like that. It means that there is no strategy that is guaranteed to work each time, which makes it harder, but a lot more fun. This is not a game you play twice and win. You can play hundreds of times and might still not win, but it's not the winning that's fun. It's finding that perfect weapon for your build, that teleporter just when you need it, unlocking a new ship. I could go on and on. This is a very hard game, and it's very unforgiving, but winning isn't what makes this game fun. Its the journey.			"

												Probably one of the best space themed roguelikes I've played yet. The spaceship battle system is deep and fun to master, but even that it is just a small fraction of every element (random events, races, weapons, planets...) that keeps this charming exploration together.

Faster Than Light is a 2D roguelike game set in space, the roguelike genre has been crawling its way back into the spotlight, however it's not common to be set in such environment.You're part of the Galactic Federation that assigned you critical information that you must deliver eight sectors away, to do so you're given a spaceship that you must upgrade and fill with crew... All this, while being chased by the Rebel force, nice setup.Faster Than Light relies heavily in random generated encounters since every time you warp to a location, you have hundreds of possible encounters with multiple outcomes, however this outcomes are sometime random as well, since the answer you gave on one playthrough might not have the same outcome on the next one. Often enough you'll feel the game cheated on you and that the result wasn't fair, however this also makes the game alive and filled with high risk high reward situations.The combat system is pretty straight forward, when your weapons are loaded you can fire, when your enemy has their weapons loaded they can fire back, however you can assign crew members to certain stations, for example to the shield station which will make the shields recharge faster or to the engine station that will help you dodge incoming fire. Even though encounters are important you also have to make decisions inside your ship by choosing your crew members which unlock special encounters solutions but also come with their pros and cons. You'll have a whole bunch to choose from the Humans, the Engi, the Mantis, the Rockmen, the Zoltan, the Slugs, The Crystal and finally the Lanius.The art of this game really stands out mainly the soundtrack that is masterfully done setting the perfect atmosphere for a game that leaves you on the edge of your chair, you'll know what I'm talking about once everythings starts going wrong and your entire ship is set ablaze or when you find yourself drifting  in space with no fuel, waiting for friend or foe to approach you with a helping hand or a loaded cannon.However not everythings perfect, even though the game is filled with Quests and Encounters they somewhat lose their essence after some playthroughs when you start seeing them repeat too often with outcomes that you are now aware and can predict most of the time. Also the difficulty even on the easiest setting might be too hard for the casual gamers, which might put some people off the game after some tries.+ Diferent Strategies and Aproaches+ Great Variety of Items and Races+ Amazing Soundtrack- Encounters get repetitive after a while88% Cool Game!Join my Steam Group page for more reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/jereviews "

												FTL is an entertaining, very replayable and murderously RNG-dependent roguelike-like. Good for space captain fantasies, even if you will likely be violently disabused of them.You control a Federation spaceship transporting intelligence that must make its way through sectors of space being chased by the Rebel fleet, for the intel points out their fleet's weaknesses. This here plot is lightly described yet more than serviceable - more on this later.Gameplay consists of turn-based jumping between FTL beacons and fighting enemies in pausable real-time combat involving charging and aiming weapons & drones, and/or deploying your own crew to board or defend against boarders. Ship systems and additional items can be bought & upgraded using scrap metal, which can be found or salvaged from defeated enemies.You must also manage your fuel supply, as well as missile and drone supplies if you use either of them. If your ship's hull takes enough damage, or your crewmembers die, your game's over.Sometimes, multiple-choice events happen - they don't change between playthroughs with the exception of different choices being unlocked with upgraded systems or crewmembers of different species. You might come to remember some of the right choices after encountering them multiple times, but the Advanced Edition seems to add enough events that this isn't as big an issue.You can also unlock quite a variety of ships between playthroughs, some of which are better than others, but most of which provide new and interesting playstyles.While you have a lot of variety between upgrades, offensive and defensive strategies to choose from, apart from your starting equipment you are quite simply more dependent on random chance than usual for a game like this. This is compounded by the fact that on difficulties above Easy, you receive less resources and the game generates tougher enemies (in exchange for increased score of course). You can and will go from doing pretty well to barely limping along in the space of one jump. The difficulty wouldn't be so bad if you had more of a guarantee of receiving the tools to deal with or run away from it if you need to.Which is to say nothing of the final boss. It's grossly overpowered and pretty unfair even for a roguelike-like, especially when you never found enough resources to upgrade your systems enough to even stand a chance - or never got the chance to use them to upgrade in the first place because you were taking so much damage. To say nothing of how it turns FTL's metagame on its head with how different the final fight is.The fact is, with the flagship you need to pursue certain upgrades and ship strategies much more than others, unless you pick one of the most powerful ships, and/or go overkill or are lucky enough with other strategies. With all of this in mind, new players should therefore start on Easy - while I can respect its presence, it's kind of baffling why people thought the game needed a Hard mode in addition to Normal.I think there's a little bit of a bright side to the difficulty, though. FTL is not only a quite fun and quite polished game, but a quite involving game, and if you become involved it makes the near-deaths and actual deaths that much more intense. On that note, you can re-name your ship and its crewmembers, and giving them personalized names only adds to the immersion. The touch of the plot is light to allow the players to fill in the gaps with their imagination, and experience their own space adventures. This isn't as much of an advantage when you simply want to win, however.At least the devs' handling of the Advanced Edition is stellar. It features additional content in almost every area, including events written by Chris Avellone of Fallout fame, and you can even turn the additional content off for the vanilla experience.Of mention is the mod community. The official forums are host to an easy-to-use mod installation tool, and many user-created mods that you can pick & choose from. They range from minor event/cosmetic additions to new ships to entire new campaigns, and can greatly extend the life of the game. Just make sure you're on top of your game and mod updates.If you like your spaceships and your roguelike-likes, pick this up - and the soundtrack is great too - but be prepared to die and die again.

												I spent 40 hours playing before writing this; this a really good game in the fact that it compels you to come back & play repeatedly despite what some would call failure. That being said I have had a great time replaying this in any difficulty, as should you, if you intend to make the most of this game. There are definitely more games out there that will make things much more brutal just for attempting it. The thrill is in the chase, hoping you can get enough power/resources to balance killing the Rebel Flagship in Sector 8.The Good: Easy, casual playing with a desire to upgrade your ship while keeping ahead of the Rebel Fleet. Tutorial goes a long way to help the average FTL noob like myself. Once you get a foothold with ANY ship, you want to see it through to the end regardless of fail or pass. Even if you fail you feel compelled to retry, not something easily said of every game that makes you want to beat your head against a very hard surface. Advanced mode enhances this experience very much so with the new Clone Bay if nothing else.The Bad: I hate to say it, the average person may look to play Normal, but I recommend Easy to start out. Why? Even Normal mode can be brutal & harsh to someone 1st starting out. Once you gain the learning curve, it becomes SOMEWHAT easier only to be offset by AI cheese. In the 1st sector you can often get ambushed a bit unfairly if inexperienced. Easy = Normal, Normal = Hard, Hard= Wanting to throw your monitor through the wall.The Ugly: Graphics are not exactly great; don't look for extravagant, mind-boggling cutscenes/story as its more reminescent of 16/32 bit system. At the same time I retell of the AI toughness, it might turn-off/confuse some looking for something easy & casual without the burden of frustration. "

This is a long review, so if you just want a quick summary of this game please skip to Results and read from there.Subset Games makes an amazingly epic choose your own adventure space combat game. Similar to a storybook FTL: Faster than Light allows you to choose destinations to approach with each location giving you a dialogue with options explaining events at the chosen location. Campaign:You play as a federation ship whose mission is to fly throughout eight space sectors in order to deliver vital information to federation fleet. The rebels are taking over the entire space system and you must fight tooth and nail to achieve victory. In each system you will run across a variety of different individuals from Pirates, Aliens, Bandits, Slavers, Smugglers, Merchants, and Humanitarians who all trove the galaxy. As the game progresses you build a ship, stock it with a crew, maintain base systems, and complete quests. The end of the game is a three part battle with an monstrous flagship which unless equip can be near impossible. FTL: Faster Than Light is a fun game that’s highly addictive and keeps you wanting to come back for more. The combat is gripping, the constant threat of an oncoming fleet of rebels keeps you moving, and the amazing scenarios make you want not. This fantastic game although great has its limitations and may not be for everyone. FTL is a hard game, even on the easiest difficulty it is no cakewalk. Advanced Edition Content adds new items to the game adding more complexity and difficulty to an already hard enough situation. Gameplay:The game plays rather smoothly. Each “jump” you do acts as a turn and allows for the rebel fleet to progress further through a sector of the galaxy. If you and the rebel fleet cross paths you enter a battle, which if you play your cards right you can escape or even win. There is a steep learners curve, but once you’ve figured out the general game mechanics FTL plays rather easily. You have the ability to pause the game during any battle in order to maneuver troops and properly decide how to place your shots. The game asks you scenarios and the result of them are entirely dumb luck, so be prepared to take chances. For example you may end up trying to communicate with an alien race and get great rewards or an equal possibility is that crew member may die. The battles can be very intense and there can be situations where you are perfectly equip and the luck of where an asteroid lands can completely change a guaranteed victory into a struggling brawl. Difficulty:This game has a lot of luck involved, so about half of the difficulty in this game is the luck and not the skill. Although this may seem to make the game look bad, it offers variability that many games do not. You will be on your toes not just because of the difficulty from the actual skill of the game, but also because anything can happen and in one foul swoop you’re ship and crew will be gone. If you want examples of why please comment as I have many examples where I have lost because of luck, but don’t worry I also have lots of why I have lost because of skill as well haha. Hints:1) Make sure you visit every possible point you can for each sector, fight off as many enemies as possible because every piece of scrap matters and you will need it all if you want to win.2) Make sure you take advantage of your crew, the longer they man a station the more efficient they become at it.3) It’s a good idea to have a crew member in every station that placing one in can provide a benefit to your ship. 4) The mind control device is probably one of the best ways to distract an enemy ship’s crew and help easily destroy the ships interior. 5) The enemy ships will always have weapons of equal charge time charged before you.6) The best way to give yourself first shot advantage is the cloaking field, it is worth saving up for.7) The Flagship has four guns, the best way to defeat it is to defeat the crewmember manning each gun.8) In my opinion the best way to defeat the flagship is with as many flak cannons as you can get (and possibly a missle that teleports itself), the cloaking field, and mind control. This will allow you to control a crew member of the enemy ship, go invisible while you recharge your weapons, and garantee you hit through the flagships shields. 9) If you kill every person in the flagship an AI takes over which is a lot harder than if you just leave someone alive (try and kill everyone except one person that way you can use them with your mind control). Results:FTL is an amazing game, but it’s not for everyone. The graphics are not top of the line and the difficulty level is high enough to make you want to strangle someone. FTL offers so fantastic fights that really keep you on the edge of your seat coupled with fantastic variety making each play through feel like a new game. If you quit a game it will create a save, but you can only load that save one time meaning that if you die you must start over. I recommend FTL, and would even recommend paying full price, but if get this on a sale it is definitely a steam-steal. Pros:+Amazing depth and variety throughout the campaign+Option to play with or without advanced edition content+Loads of different weapons to choose from+Quests and distress signals to keep you invested in each sector+Choose your own path so you can preemptively target your gameplay.+Epic space battles that focus on managing both the interior and exterior of a ship. +Many different ship designs, but good luck getting them unless you plan to invest several hundred hours into this game. +Different sector types that offer different combat and elements. Cons:-The choice results are random, there are a lot of take your chance situations.-The battles can be decided by dumb luck rather than skill.-The final boss battle (the flagship) is rediculously difficult. [for advice check the hints section]-FTL has a lack of resolution settings and in windowed mode it looks like is barely 1024x768 and does not allow you to make it larger.			"

												This is one of the most unexpectedly wonderful games that I’ve encountered recently. It’s a rogue-like starship with a basic objective: destroy the rebel flagship and pick up as many supplies and resources on your way there as you can to help you do it.The most wonderful part of this game is that you can control all of the nifty little features that a typical space ship game should have that never does. Example: There is a fire in your weapons room. You can order your crew out of the weapons room and into another one and then use the individual door controls to vent atmosphere out of the weapons room to snuff out the fire, close the doors, repressurize and then it’s business as normal. (same tactic also works for boarding parties). That’s just a tiny little feature, but it’s stuff like that which make it feel like it’s actually your ship and you have a range of options on how to deal with situations you run into. If you want extra power on your shields or engines or weapons or sensors or door controls, you can actually assign your crew there to enhance the system in a pinch or build their skills for significant aids for the big battle.Missile, beams, burst lasers, hacking, boarding parties, mind control, drones and automated boarding bots, med bays, clone bays, mines, etc. etc. The game has a host of systems and every play is unique, not only based on what your starting ship is, but the things you will encounter and what things you will pick up and the crew you will find. There’s disorienting nebulae, ion pulse suns, solar flares, asteroid fields and more. You can choose where you want to go in order to scavenge supplies and try to delay the rebel fleet. Some strategies may be to your advantage, others may not. It’s up to you and RNGesus.Probably the biggest thing to note about this game is that it’s short – like really short. It’s not meant to be a 125 hour campaign (hello Crusader Kings II), it’s meant to be an old fashioned evening board game. Consequently, it typically takes only 2-3 hours to do a playthrough, regardless of whether you win or lose. Personally, I think this works to the game’s advantage. Because you do get to remember your crew and what their skills are, the weapons you pick up, and a general attachment to your ship, but not overly so that you cannot stand losing it and won’t ever pick the game up again. You should feel good about how far you came and that you did well even if you lose and look forward to trying a different strategy next time or just rolling the dice again and seeing what you encounter next time. You will most likely get to see the rebel flagship on most playthroughs on most ships, and whether you win or lose at that point is up to your achievements. It’s far more fun just to get there.			"

												I got this game for $0.99 during the Steam Summer Sale and regret nothing.  For being a fairly small indie game, it is highly addictive and challenging.

												Let me just start this review by saying that you can't go wrong with an indie game like this one. GraphicsEvery single one of these elements will not be altered by mods, I'll leave that for my mods segemnt towards the end of this review. The graphics of FTL are simple yet extravagent, the game itself is simple, the UI is easy to understand and learn, and the different backgrounds/planets and stars all have their unique characteristics and look absolutely lovely. This game is simplistic, so I can't really take points off of it for having simple textures, it's meant to be that way. GameplayOkay so first off this is a difficult lil game to learn in it's own respects, you have to master the art of pressing the spacebar (pause) before and after every show you take, and every shot your opponent takes. If you don't, well you'll end up losing crew members (which some crew members could take the entire length of the adventure to level up, and a loss like that is devestating to your progress). The best tip I can give you is to prepare to press the number keys (for your weapon systems) and the spacebar (for pausing the game) quite often as that will help you plan your strategy of attack a lot easier than not doing so in the first place. Obviously, I didn't pay attention to the tips or numbers above every panel in the game so it took me a while to realize I could use hotkeys, which made the game a lot more difficult than it should've been for me when first starting to play.  StoryThis game doesn't have much of a story, you're the captain of your own warship that gets sent on a mission to find a stronghold. Along the way you encounter ships and planets/asteroid fields and even colonies that try to brutally murder you and your crew within mere seconds of jumping into orbit. Your objective is to get to the end, with a powerful crew, upgraded subsystems and the weaponry to destroy the final boss (which is really, really difficult if you're unprepared). Overall it's an adventurious lil game and very, very addicting. You'll be racing to speedrun and beat highscores for hours if you get lucky enough to find good weapons along your journey. Mod SupportFinally right? This is one of the most amazing parts of FTL as literally every part of this game can be altered through modifications that the developers even asked the community to make. From the story, where you can make finite decisions, endless journies and even completely different campaigns and stories such as Infinite Space. To the graphic overhauls where you get new backgrounds and visual elements from mods like Better Backgrounds and Planets to a mod like Crew Diversity that allows you to have multiple crew members with different visual looks and personalities. Here's the list of all working mods at this very moment, I recommend starting off with Captain's Edition and seeing how you like it from there, as the base game was stupendous but the mods make it into a gem of an adventure.  SummarySo in total, I've spent countless hours on this game and on experiencing the diffrent ways of playing through it, although the Infinite Space mod has no real ending other than you either becoming so overpowered that you literally cannot die, or you dying within your first two sectors, it's still lovely. I'd recommend that you buy this game because it's an adventure, it's a simple pleasure and it's enjoyable yet addictive. For a cheap pricetag, I managed to snag it for $2 through a steam sale a few years back. Obviously worth it, since I put so many hours into it and so much time into this review. Go buy it, it's worth it. Overall, a solid 9/10 from my perspective, if you were able to learn the UI elements more simply (before the tutorial was introduced, because that's when I started playing. Yes, all the way back in 2013, I believe) and able to learn how to maneuver through combat, then I'd give it a perfect 10/10.			"

												FTL is the world's premiere door management simulator.---Your ship has been struck by an incendiary bomb, and the shield generator room is on fire. Never fear: instead of sending your soldiers in to put the fire out, simply open the doors to space and let the vacuum do it for you.Piratical praying mantises have just teleported into your cockpit, and if you'd upgraded your doors, they wouldn't be tearing through the ship, and your soldiers, like a hot knife through butter. But you didn't, because you wanted a bigger gun. So now you're all dead.A massive laser has cut a hole in your engine room, and you've sent half your crew to patch it up. Hope you remembered to open the ship's interior doors to balance out the atmosphere, so they don't suffocate in the process.Two of your crew have teleported to the enemy ship and are sabotaging its cloaking generator. To keep the enemy out, you've hacked the cloaking device--including its doors. Now, their heavily-upgraded door system is keeping them out, not you.You've got two crew left, and one of them just got mind-controlled by your alien foe. The engine room is his domain, now--but your last crew member is safe in the pilot's seat, behind a thick, thick door.---Almost every game has doors in it, but few of them do much with them. If FTL can make doors this important to your tactical choices, just imagine the depth you can achieve with  lasers, drones, teleporters, cloaking devices, mind control, power, sensors, and more?

												When I first downloaded this highly praised title (not on Steam) I was immediately surprised at how much depth a 2D game with RNG and permadeath could have.  I finally bought it through Steam (an embarrassingly high amount of hours later), and as an introduction to the genre I am now a huge fan of rogue-like and rogue-lite games. You're given a starter ship and a small crew to outrun the rebels and eventually face off against their flagship through 8 star systems.  While in flight you have to manage everything from power distribution of desired systems to crew locations to ammo, shield, and fuel management as well as system and weapon upgrades, hiring more crew etc etc.  In combat there are things like fire suppression, crew healing, oxygen management, weapon power management, target selection, shield management, etc etc etc.  Your attack abilities can range from multiple projectiles that wear down an enemies shields, drones that keep up a constant attack while your weapons recharge, porting over to the enemy ship and doing crew combat, targeting specific systems so they can't fly away or use their weapons, using lasers to destroy their hull, etc etc. Putting them all together can be intense and overwhelming and is a bit punishing at first.  I quickly learned that I needed to start the game in easy mode to make any sort of progress.  The further I made it the more I learned which weapons I liked, which upgrades worked for me, and how to manage my scrap for purchases.  The game has many RNG elements, and no two playthroughs will feel the same, but as you continue to play your progress consistently increases. The first time I beat the flagship by the skin of my teeth but then I began to beat it pretty easily and was ready for the next ship design or difficulty. There is a huge amount of replay value here.  It has to be one of the few games on a short list that I've ever replayed after beating it.  As you progress and unlock achievements you unlock different layouts and better ships.  Each of the ships has their own style of combat and crew eg. more focused on using drones for attack and defense or the crew is mostly a race that is better at porting over to a ship and attacking or has quick repair and heal ability which allows you to ignore medical upgrades and focus on others etc. I would definitely recommend picking this up on sale and giving it a try.  Very addictive and really polished.  I would just recommend starting it on easy mode!			"

												It's 2016 and you definitely could see let's plays and other reviews of this game, so I'll leave the boring details out.This is the kind of game that makes you start it on a Sunday evening at 11 P.M. to play it for 15 minues. The thing is, 15 minutes later it's 7 A.M. and you're late to work.The gameplay is fantastic and the replay value is nigh infinite.The soundtrack is a masterpiece, it fits the game's theme fantastically and creates powerful mood of lonely space exploration. It's almost romantic.The only problem I can think of is incorrect naming of difficulty levels. They're not Easy, Normal, Hard, but Hard, Very Hard and Almost Impossible respectively. You will rage quit a lot at first, but then you'll start loving the way it hurts.tl;dr: I haven't enjoyed a game as much since my childhood.			"

												Addictive and fun to play, FTL is the space roguelike that will have you desperatley struggling time and time again to complete it. Along the way you can unlock different ship layouts, recruit different races with different stats, but different weapons and upgrade different parts of your ship and, well every game will be different is what I'm trying to say! Very enjoyable and not very expensive, definitely worth a look if you are interested.			"

												Simple but with a lot of depth. Even after many hours I still have room for improvement which is uncommon for such a small game. Eventually I might even win on Normal difficulty. If you want to blow up space ships and get eaten by giant spiders this is 10/10 the game for you.			"

												FTL... Where do I start? Let me get this off my chest right off the bat: This game is going to kick your ♥♥♥. Even on it's ""Easy"" mode, it took me multiple runs through the game before I even made it to the last sector. It took me countless more runs to finally defeat the boss, and let me tell you, the first time you defeat the enemy flagship it is immensely gratifying.Everything about this game is fun. The combat mechanics and how you manage your ship is very clever, and you have to be constantly vigilant in a fight, lest your enemy get in that fatal hit on you. In a lot of the text-based encounters, there's a risk-vs-reward factor, where going in and say, investigating an abandoned space station might net you some extra scrap metal, but you might also lose your best Pilot in the process. The variety in ships you use and of those you can encounter is aplenty, and any number of different playstyles can be used with varying degrees of success.The little things about it are great too: there's just enough background information to hold the plot together, while also leaving lots to your imagination. The graphic style is quite charming, and every note of the soundtrack works perfectly in tandem with what's going on in the game.All in all, a great little indie title, for a very reasonable price. 9/10			"

												A game where you click enemy ships to slowly murder them until you can make a second layer of shields from slowly murdered ships. If you successfully murder enough enemy ships, you will get the exclusive priveledge of getting stomped by one huge ship that ♥♥♥♥♥ on the rules you encounter up to that point and does whatever it wants.BUT, if you murder ships in the most efficient way possible, select the right sentences when needed, effectively utilize murdered ship pieces and know everything the big ship will throw at you, you can MAYBE even get a chance of stomping the big ship back... until it ""gets away"" when ""destroyed"" only to come back two more times and stomp you anyway.Yes, the game is a mouse-driven RNG based rouge-like with a bit of a learning curve and a surprising amount of depth.It does involve a Dark Souls amount of death, and there is never a guarantee that you will win. But a lot of the RNG can be manipulated with enough skill and knowledge.Very effective time waster. I never really understood why people like The Binding of Isaac until I got into this.			"

												This cruel rougelike will test you to your very limits. A small mistake will cost you big here, although there are many things you cannot control. A lot of this game has RNG aspects, causing some very frustrating situations (I'm looking at you, giant alien spiders!). This game is insanely difficult, and there is no doubt that all players have raged at some point. There are many difficult situations to be made at times. An example of this is what to spend your precious scrap on. A single mistake can cost you big time, and can often result in the death of a crewmember or a loss entirely.In spite of this, this game is a blast to play, and it is very satisfying to hear the sound of a hull breach in an enemy ship or to destroy a ship. There are many different alien races that all have different advantages and disadvantages to them. For example, Rockmen have increased health but move much more slowly. There are many different ships that can be unlocked, with entirely different play styles.I have passed 20 hours of playtime at the time of writing, yet I've barely scratched the surface of this outstanding game. Unless you get angry REALLY easily, it would be idiotic not to pick up this game NOW.			"

Laconic Review: FTL: Faster Than Light is a perfect recipe for an addictive game. Its deceptive simplicity is betrayed by the room for strategy and tactics. This coupled with its rapid difficulty climb makes it absolutely engrossing. Its replayability is unquestionably high thanks to the game’s heavy use of RNG and its Oregon Trail-esque scenarios which can make a particular run easy or end it then and there. The game creates a retro vibe with its charming pixel art style and a very fitting soundtrack that definitely deserves to be sold on its own.9/10P.S. NEVER SEND IN CREW TO HELP WITH GIANT ALIEN SPIDERS IT NEVER  WORKS OUTFull Review:  FTL: Faster Than Light is another edition to the ever growing rogue-lite genre. Affectionately reffered to as “Oregon Trail in Space,” FTL is about making your way across a galaxy to deliver vital information about enemy rebels to The Federation. Along this trip you must equip yourself with weapons, fight enemy ships, and make Oregon Trail esque decision that can either lead to great rewards or have your best crew member be eaten by a giant alien spiders.The combat in FTL can be described as “semi-turn based.” Weapons require time to charge up before firing, however different weapons take different amounts of time to charge making it so weapons go off at set intervals but not strictly in turns. You can also target specific systems of the enemy ship to fire on in order to minimize damage taken and maximize damage dealt. For example, a common tactic is to use missiles, which ignore shields, to take out the shield system so that you may use your rapid fire laser weapons to take out their weapon system.There are 4 different weapon types: Laser, Beam, Missile, and Ion, each which have their own merits and disadvantages allowing a wide array of strategy to be used. However arming yourself and manfighting any ship that comes your way isn’t your only option. Along your trip in FTL you will come across stores which can sell you new crew members, weapons, ship augments, and ship systems for scrap you collect by defeating ships or as rewards for random scenarios. One possible system you can arm yourself with is a Drone Control system, which allows you to let drone AI do all the fighting for you while you can just focus on defense. Another system you can get is the Crew Teleport system which you use to send your most combat effective crewmembers onto the enemy ship. This allows you to defeat the enemy without destroying the ship which yields more scrap and has a chance to get you a new weapon, drone schematic, or ship augment.As this is a rogue-lite game, FTL makes extensive use of RNG. For example, you must make your way through 8 “sectors,” each sector has a procedurally generated star map with around 20 beacons each. The content and pattern of the beacons vary wildly with the only real guarantee being that you can make it from the starting point to the exit beacon that takes you to the next sector. Moreover, sectors are randomly made into one of three types, hostile, civilian, and nebula, each with their own race specific subtype. The sector type determines what is sold in stores, the likelihood of certain outcomes for scenarios, the types of enemies you face, and sector exclusive scenarios. While you can only go through 8 sectors in the game, the map will you give you multiple paths to choose from so you are not at the total mercy of RNG.FTL further elaborates its rogue-lite elements with its replayability. In fact the only overall progress possible in this game is unlocking new ships to start with. You unlock these ships by getting achievements, completing specific quests, and beating the game repeatedly. However the achievements required to unlock ships are seldom easy. The quests needed to unlock ships usually require you to make a few specific decisions across multiple scenarios while praying that RNG is with you. Not only that, beating the game is very difficult, as you advance across sectors enemy ships become better equipped to the point that making it to Sector 8 is a feat on its own. Then there’s what awaits at Sector 8, the Rebel Flagship, an enemy so strong it makes all other before it seem like shieldless auto-scouts.FTL has an almost retro feel thanks to its pixel art graphics. While not necessarily impressive, it works. It’s the closest thing FTL has as a weak point but in a way that only serves as a deterrent for those who wouldn’t be able to enjoy the gameplay to begin with. The graphics are complimented with the atmospheric chiptune soundrack. A soundtrack which definitely deserves to be sold on its own.Personally, I have a strong affinity towards roguelike and rogue-lite games and FTL is no exception. The way that doing the same thing in certain scenarios doesn’t always yield the same result across playthroughs can be both exciting and incredibly frustrating. Likewise the placement of stores and the frequency of difficult enemies can make me want to destroy my computer. But that’s just part of the challenge and what makes this game addictive. But remember, never try to send in crew to help with giant alien spiders			"

												I highly recommend FTL. It's a game that you can save and quite within a few minutes notice, but when you come back you are immidiatly immersed in the game play. I could barely believe I had already played over 7 hrs of it. as a bus rider, I like a game that is highly entertaing and deep, but can be saved at a moments notice so I can jum off the bus. Aditionally the permanance of death in this game makes the stakes super high. It is upsetting to loose crew members you have been working with for a long period of time, which is a testiment to how it emotionally bring you into the world of FTL.			"

												Random generation of the maps allow for nearly infite replayability. To me this is what games should be, solid game mechanics on top of flexible levels allowing you to play what makes the game fun over and over. At times you can feel invincible tearing through easy encouters, only to make a bad warp and have your game crumble in front of you. Other times you'll feel like you're barely outrunning the rebel menace and finding salvation through a lucky jump to some great ship parts. This game is not for people who like to know what is always coming, but I personally love how it always leaves me questioning if I am making the right decision. Buy this game if you like strategic thinking in an uncertain world.			"

												Questo FTL - Faster Than Light (grazie al cielo che il titolo è in inglese, il corrispettivo termine italiano è Velocità Superluminare, e nessuno vuole giocare a qualcosa con un nome così brutto), rinchiude tutto ciò che un RogueLike dovrebbe avere, con la differenza che al posto del nostro classico eroe solitario questa volta dovremo portare la nostra astronave alla fine dell'universo! La storia è semplicissima, ma tanto non serve a nessuno conoscerla: abbiamo rubato dei preziosissimi piani segreti e dobbiamo portarli in salvo alla fine dell'universo, mentre tutta la flotta galattica di non ricordo quale fazione ci starà alle calcagna, avanzando a rastrelliera, galassia dopo galassia, per trovarci e sterminarci. L'universo, in questo gioco, è rappresentato come una fila di galassie da esplorare (otto, per la precisione), ognuna composta da un buon numero di ""punti di interesse"" tra cui possiamo trovare richieste di aiuto, campi di asteroidi, pianeti in guerra, navi pirata pronti a tenderci una trappola e utilissimi negozi spaziali (oltre a tanti eventi più o meno unici, a cui possiamo reagire in diversi modi a seconda del nostro equipaggiamento e della composizione della nostra ciurma). Oltre all'ansia di aver alle spalle tutta l'armata galattica, dovremo fare i conti anche con il nostro serbatoio di carburante: ad ogni salto interstellare (ovvero un movimento da un punto della mappa ad un altro) consumeremo una unità di preziosa benzina, costringendoci a pianificare un poco i movimenti e spesso mandandoci alla ricerca  di negozi in cui fare rifornimento (o ad assaltare una nave civile rubandogli qualsiasi cosa).Leggi l'Astrorecensione su: http://theshelternetwork.com/ftl-verso-linfinito-ed-oltreeeeh/ "

FTL is one of the finest roguelikes in gaming history, complete with a unique art style and captivating soundtrack. You start out with the most basic equipment, but you'll bulk up your ship from a massive selection of weapons, augments, drones, upgrades, systems/subsystems, and crew. It requires a bit of micromanagement and planning, but the element of roguelike luck keeps you on your toes so you never become too attached to one particular strategy.""Missiles seem to be working well for me, but what if I run out?""""Do I spend scrap on upgrading my blast doors, or risk being boarded by the Mantis or Rock?""And above all,""How much do I like burning things?""With bombs, missiles, laser shots, laser beams, and flak weapons (which may cause hull, system, crew, breach, stun, ion, or fire damage while faring differently against shields, improved engines, cloaking, and defense drones), no full playthrough will ever be remotely the same, and you'll never want it to be.

												Nonserious review: OH GOD EVERYTHING IS BURNING PLEASE HELP ME OH GOD THE OXYGEN IS GONE WAIT DON'T BLOW US UP PLE- *explosions form a 9/10*Serious review = the rest of thisFTL is a space ship game in which you are the captain of a space ship trying to save the galaxy (universe?) from the Rebels, as you are playing the Federation. It is an extremely brutal game, which is good, because while excessive brutality is bad, I'd rather have that then have excessive hand-holding. As a review would do, pros and cons and neutrals will come next.PROS:Extreme difficulty, but not unfair difficulty. This game is very, very, VERY hard to actually win, in fact, in 26 hours, I have only won ONE TIME. Most of the times you lose, it is because you forgot to do something essential, such as repair the doors, put out the fire in the oxygen room before letting out all of the oxygen to put out the other fires, putting out fires, upgrading, etceteraA plethora (wow, who uses that word anymore?) of weapons. You got good weapons, bad weapons, pew pew weapons, BWEEE weapons, PCHEW weapons, VWABABA weapons, and more (in order, good weapons, bad weapons, laser weapons, beam weapons, explosive weapons, teleporting weapons)All the replayability ever. I can 100% guarantee that you will NEVER play the same run twice. Sometimes you'll get the GLAIVE BEAM OF DEATH, sometimes you will get the basic laser of OH GOD WE CAN'T PENETRATE THEIR SHIELDS, and sometimes you'll get both of them and then you can actually do somethingSo many unlockables. There are I believe 10 or 11 ships, maybe only 8, I really don't remember. Every ship has 3 types of that ship you can unlock except for 1 or 2 of them, plus they all have 2 ways of unlocking them, except for 3 of them, and one of them is one you start withMusic. The music is absolutely amazing. That is allNEUTRALSThere are noneNEGATIVESUuuuuuuuuuuuh... I can't think of any. And that is a good thing!All in all, this game is amazing and addictive, and I give it a 9/10. Why not a 10/10 even though I couldn't think of any negatives? BECAUSE THE GAME REFUSES TO GIVE ME THE GLAIVE BEAM! OH GOD GAME NO I'M SORRY FOR YELLING PLEASE NO DON'T SET THE OXYGEN SUPPLY ON FIRE OH GOD IS THAT A MANTIS BOMBER I'M SORR-			"

Work in ProgressThis review is incomplete. I will update/finish it when I find the time.This is currently my favorite offline game. Anytime my usual addictions are unavailable, I always head straight for FTL and tackle another playthrough. This game is easily worth the $10 USD price tag, if not more. The recent expansion pack only adds to this value, and I almost feel guilty for not paying for so much content. It could have easily been a $5 DLC. FTL is a roguelite space simulation game developed by Subset Games. It features perma-death, realtime strategy with the ability to pause and give orders, randomized level design, and nearly endless replay value.Starting off with the tutorial, you'll get a quick briefing of the plot and objective, followed by a rundown of the UI. After jumping to the next location, you'll find your first battle which offers some helpful tips like using missiles to take out enemy shield systems. After combat, upgrade your ships reactor and weapon system and you're all set. The whole tutorial takes about 5 minutes. If you can't be bothered with 5 minutes, skip it. You can mouse-over just about everything for detailed tooltips at any point in the game.My biggest, and only notable, gripe with this game is that it doesn't support Steam Achievements. I find this very odd since it has it's own in-game achievements not recognized by Steam.			"

												-crew killed by pirates-crew killed by fire-crew killed by asphyxiation-crew killed by asphyxiation again-crew killed by asphyxiation yet again-crew killed by asphyxiati... HOLY S%&!... this is hard (that's what she said)all in all fun, the visuals of the game actually remind me of a little game called Bik A Space Adventure; however that is where the similarities stop. This game is incredibly difficult and is one of the few games you should not be ashamed to play on easy. The concept is that you basically run a space ship that is carrying important information for The Federation/Universal gov thingy ,,, besides the point, the idea is that you cross various sectors of galaxies with your crew fighting space pirates, various aliens, rebels, etc... On your journey you will die a lot, and if you think ""oh I'll only die a few times"" or ""couldn't be that bad"" YOU ARE WRONG! You will die repeatedly in bizzare ways and other ways that make you believe that there is some malevolent god laughing at your feable attempts. However this should not diture casuals such as myself away from this game; it may be difficult, yet is still a blast for those less ""rouge like"" inclined because dying is half the fun and most of the battle. Any who I reccomend to pick this bad boy up on sale and join me in the serial  killer like process of almost systematically sufficating your crew.Best asphxyation sim out there 10/10			"

												Faster Than Light is a space semi-rouglike where you pilot a ship through space and micromanage the crew and systems onboard while trying to fight off enemies that will not stop until you're a pile of smoldering space-scrap.  It has a huge amount of hype behind it, and it is mostly well deserved.  The music is superb, the gameplay is fun and it's quite a charming game overall.  I would recommend picking it up, especially on sale - it hits $2.50 at times, and it is easily worth that.FTL has awesome, addictive gameplay with a high amount of replayability; however, while it may seem infinite at first, it really begins to seem like you've seen everything the game has to offer after a few play sessions.  Games take awhile, and, while random, there isn't really that big of a pool of things that can happen to you out in deep space.  While there may be minor variances, it mostly boils down to: Warp into a place, oh no! there's a spaceship here, fight it, warp to the next sector.  Don't get me wrong, the game is a lot of fun, but after 4 or 5 runs, you can kind of expect what's going to happen in a future game.To combat this, there are many different unlockable ships, all of which provide different ways to play, but that said, you really don't have much motivation to go unlock those after you've dumped a couple hours into it.Pros:SoundtrackFun gameplayInteresting mechanicsCons:Not a very large pool of random things that can happen (wears out fast)Games take a long timeIt's a little disappointing to me, especially since the game was so hyped in my circles, but that's alright, it's still a really solid game and, as I said, it comes cheap.  Pick it up on a sale, but until then don't worry about missing anything too important - it's fun and random, but you won't be playing it forever. B			"

												FTL Is an all around awesome game. Simple, easy to lear gameplay mechanings, a really well designed and extremly thought out UI, combat system, and over-all game mechanincs make this one super easy to pick up, and tons of fun to really tweak and master. The soundtrack is fantastic, the graphics are clean and look nice without having to have a gaming rig.  Not a big install, and overall the game seems well polished without any bugs. Don't be afraid to play this game more than once, or more than a few dozen or hundred times. And don't be afraid to love every single one of those runs, because they will all be different, and more importantly, they will all be fun. Each time you play again. If this were in an arcade, it would be the game we all sink our quarters into a few rounds, every single time we go.			"

												FTL is incrediably addictive. Sometimes it all goes well, and sometimes it goes so terribly wrong you want to smash the screen. The replay value is top notch! So many ships, weapons, enemies, encounters, and tactics!!!It's only gotten better since the extra content has been added.This is one of those games that you can get so many awesome experiences out of, but unfortunately only other FTL players will know your plight. Graphic design, mechanics, and the MUSIC are also great. I would HIGHLY recommend this game to any and all. So long as you have patience. :)			"

												FTL: Faster Than Light is a beauty. With an aura of adventure and strategy so other games cannot have, this is one of my favorite games. The game's balancing is excellent. The unlockable ships are not more powerful than the starter ship; it all depends on skill and play strategies. This game can weed out the unfit by having them rage quit because of the game's difficulty, but those who are in that crowd-myself included- can enter the Easy Mode which is less of a challenge. The permadeath experience causes you to mourn a crewmember's loss in two ways more than most games; Not only do you care about them, like in most games, but you also rebuke yourself for your foolishness if it is your fault and begin freaking out a bit when your ship starts failing. And the fealing of panic is spot-on. If there's a hull breach, then another, then six fires, you start panicking. This leads me to the excellent feature of the pause button. You can plan your attacks, repairs, and defenses. For those players who want more of a hardcore experience, you can test your skills without a pause button. The risks of death in random events are high, making you want to take part in less; this is a good feature as well. The overall experience of the game makes this incredible. The satisfaction of unlocking a new ship is incredible. The difficulty of a fire or a hull breach in your ship makes the experience even better. The difficulty and yet rewards in boarding parties is amazing as well. Everything in this game can be decided by a single variable in anything. If you have enemy boarders on your Engi ship, you're a bit screwed, but if the enemy has Human crew and you attack them with the Mantis, there is a lot less struggle. This game... Is incredible.

												FTL is a game about managing the crew of your spaceship as you explore and fight your way through to the rebel flagship. Managing your available crew and resources such as fuel and scrap is an important gameplay element. Plan ahead so that you can make it to the next repair-station and re-stock on fuel, but at the same time taking the gamble to buy a powerful weapon or upgrading your ship might be more beneficial in the end, if you get that far that is.The game is very difficult, and at first it will feel as if the games randomness screws you over repeatedly, but learn from your mistakes, and defating the final boss is a very rewarding experience.There are multiple ways to bypass your enemies, some are strictly combat oriented while others are event based and you get a choice whether to attack or not. Combat is also fairly diverse with many different types of weapons systems such as lasers, drones or why not just straight up board the enemy ship, which earns you more resources and possibly crewmembers as well.Multiple ships and crewmembers that all come with special abilities gives this game alot of replayability, though most of the ships have to be earned by finishing certain encounters that rely on alot of things happening in a certain order.The soundtrack is diverse and it is nice how the music seamlessly switches from a calmer exploration to the more agressive combat music as you engage enemy ships.The graphics style is also really nice, with a spirite based style of graphics that is very pleasing to look at.All in all FTL is a nice experience, though you will probably be frustrated with it a few times as you get no repair stations and slowly die with that awesome weapon you found early.

												Amazing game. It's a rougelike adventure where you are at the helm of a ship that is carrying information vital to the survival of the remaining Federation fleet; the last remaining hope for the federation after their crushing defeat from the Rebels. You will have your ups and downs, sometimes escaping death by less than a second, just to have all your success of escaping near death crush down on you when the next ship you encounter happens to be a Mantis war vessel armed to the teeth. You may lose and you may find the game to be a bit harsh at times, but it can be assured that you will always come back and try to save the Federation from the verge of defeat with what little is at your disposal, time and time again. 9/10			"

												I have heard quite a lot about this game prior to getting it myself (thank you Humble Bundle!). However I was not prepared for such a mind-blowing experience. I was captivated for over 20 hours, leaving the screen only to pee or grab something to bite. And something like that did not happen to me for a LOOOONG time. But you may ask what is the game about. Basically you get a space ship, crew and some weapons to start with. From then you write the story yourself. Do you feel like a badass? Name your captain Mal Reynolds and fly your Serenity through the space to warn the Federation about the Rebel fleet attack (oh wait, something is not right here) or maybe you want to fly your own Enterprise. Everything is up to you.But first you need to get over the simplistic graphics. These are rather functional, but come with an advantage of leaving a lot up to your own imagination, which may serve you better than anything drawn by ""A"" class designers in the end. So what are you waiting for? Hurry up on your own boundless space adventure. It does not matter whether you prefer Cpt. Reynolds or Cpt. Kirk, FTL: Faster Than Light has it all!			"

												FTL is an amazing game. The strategy involved is wonderful, and as you never know what you will get on any given run, (like any roguelike) you have to adapt on the fly. This game will kill you. A lot. It is not for the faint of heart, or light of patience. But that first time you beat the game with a ship feels like absolute Nirvana.The systems are wonderful, from cloaking to shields, you have to carefully plan what you will upgrade or purchase, but they give so much diversity in what you can do to win. Hack an enemy's Oxygen and watch their crew slowly suffocate. Blast them to pieces after a jump with rockets and lasers using a preigniter. Destroy their med bay, and teleport on board with giant space insects to butcher their crew. Activate cloaking to avoid a barrage of missiles and lasers. Light their ship on fire with fire bombs and cackle maniacally as they burn.All things aside, this is a great game to burn a few (hundred) hours on. Buy it. Do it now.			"

												I have perished to living batteries, giant mantises, rock-solid golems, telepathic orange space slugs, synthetic cyborgs,  giant space spiders, pirates, rebels, slavers, traders, merchants, madmen, asteroids, disease, solar flares, missiles, drones, lasers, oxygen-sucking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and living crystals. I have also saved the galaxy and the Federation, with my veteran crew on my glorious ship ""The Timbit""In all seriousness though, FTL is a fun space rogue-like that lets you commandeer a crew and help them survive in space to accomplish their mission, and each subsequent play-through will be memorable. Either you brilliantly navigate to the final boss and defeat the flagship with the bare minimum resources and whoop with joy. Or you may fume as you watch your ship perish, either in battle or to some other absurdity of the universe. This game is random, but it makes winning so much more interesting. Accept failed runs, and figure out the good choices that maximize your success chance on subsequent ones.The hard as nails comparison can be drawn similarly to games like Binding Of Isaac. Not for the faint of heart or impatient.Edit: I played FTL offline a lot on a laptop, so excuse my hours. Also the Advanced Edition adds substantial new content, (New Alien race, A new Ship, more upgrades and gear, galaxies, etc.).			"

												Everyone knows about FTL in some form or fashion, its a household name by this point in time.  It is a 2D topdown stratagy game, and also a Roguelike game, that features permadeath and random chance.  No two play throughs are the same.  You also have the ability to unlock other ships of other races to try new tactics, each ship has its own uniquie challenge and twist to add to the game.  However sometimes the game screws you from the start with a bout of bad luck, to unlock more ships often requires absurdly good luck while your blindly jumping around trying to get everything you need.

												Lt Bowie's log: 3265 (Status: Bowie's in Space)It's been five years and 6 complete sectors now, surely we must be close to our goal. The Federation outpost's signal's weak on my radar screen, it must still be pretty far out man (note to self: get crew to boost the HMS Starman's nipple antennae).From finding life on mars back in Sector 1 and seeing all the stars in between, where are we now?An advanced slaver ship orbiting a blackstar has hailed us demanding one of our own be offered up to them as cargo. Bit ironic for it being Valentine's Day. The captain's arrogant enough to claim he's ""the man who sold the world"" habitating on sector 5. First Engineer Alan Rickman tells me our engines are strong enough to pull away immediately without any confrontation. In my mind that means they're also strong enough to dodge, and between my piloting skills and Alan's skill on the engines only a few shots should hit us. Alan's golden years have only made him stronger. Weapons Officer Lemmy has gotten so skilled with his metal that they'll be facing a constant barrage of lasers, ions and missiles - it'll be rock & roll suicide on their part. The mantis called Charlie we picked up back in Sector 2 can keep the shields recharging faster than I've ever seen, and for a mantis he's pretty great with a spanner if the system's hit as well. And plenty more than one boarder's faced his claws before. Our other guy, Brian from Sector 3 is still doing ok, but still a bit of an absolute beginner. We've been through plenty of changes, and we're all the stronger for it. Let's hope their ship goes ashes to ashes before we take a hit.Our hull's in critical condition, but despite our opponent's advanced ship this shouldn't last long...

												I blew up repeatedly. Love this game, but I do feel that it is too random and not much skill. Sure you have to be somewhat skilled to finish the game, but you have to find the traders selling essential gear in order to finish the last boss. If you don't find these traders or find them when you are broke, you have almost certainly already failed the run.			"

												That's exactly the game I've been looking for.You select a spaceship and go into the deepest space. You manage the crew and fight with other spaceships. You'll be able to upgrade different systems like shields, engine, oxygen, weapons etc. Also there're subsystems like doors, sensors. For example, you can upgrade your doors so fire from one room won't get into another. That's really helpful, because there'll be a lot of explosions which will cause fire.While playing you gotta care about fuel and the condition of your spacecraft. If it's broken - the game ends.The best idea about this game for me is that YOU control every system and every single person from your crew you have on board. It's much more interesting this way.I strongly recommend to you buy this game if you prefer to think and not thoughtlessly shoot everything that comes in your sight. Buy it anyway.10/10!			"

Bit ironic for it being Valentine's Day. The captain's arrogant enough to claim he's ""the man who sold the world"" habitating on sector 5. First Engineer Alan Rickman tells me our engines are strong enough to pull away immediately without any confrontation. In my mind that means they're also strong enough to dodge, and between my piloting skills and Alan's skill on the engines only a few shots should hit us.

The mantis called Charlie we picked up back in Sector 2 can keep the shields recharging faster than I've ever seen, and for a mantis he's pretty great with a spanner if the system's hit as well. And plenty more than one boarder's faced his claws before. Our other guy, Brian from Sector 3 is still doing ok, but still a bit of an absolute beginner.

												FTL is a game about managing the crew of your spaceship as you explore and fight your way through to the rebel flagship. Managing your available crew and resources such as fuel and scrap is an important gameplay element. Plan ahead so that you can make it to the next repair-station and re-stock on fuel, but at the same time taking the gamble to buy a powerful weapon or upgrading your ship might be more beneficial in the end, if you get that far that is.The game is very difficult, and at first it will feel as if the games randomness screws you over repeatedly, but learn from your mistakes, and defating the final boss is a very rewarding experience.There are multiple ways to bypass your enemies, some are strictly combat oriented while others are event based and you get a choice whether to attack or not. Combat is also fairly diverse with many different types of weapons systems such as lasers, drones or why not just straight up board the enemy ship, which earns you more resources and possibly crewmembers as well.Multiple ships and crewmembers that all come with special abilities gives this game alot of replayability, though most of the ships have to be earned by finishing certain encounters that rely on alot of things happening in a certain order.The soundtrack is diverse and it is nice how the music seamlessly switches from a calmer exploration to the more agressive combat music as you engage enemy ships.The graphics style is also really nice, with a spirite based style of graphics that is very pleasing to look at.All in all FTL is a nice experience, though you will probably be frustrated with it a few times as you get no repair stations and slowly die with that awesome weapon you found early.

												A strategy game that has a surprising amount of depth and decision making involved, both in battle and outside of it. Quite unforgiving since you cannot go back in time and undo your choices but still so damn addictive to see how far you can get before your ship explodes, your pursuers catch you or you run out of fuel right in middle of desolate deep space. I think there is an ultimate goal of some sort but I have yet to find it, even on easy difficulty since I've been blown apart by some A-class capital ship or cruiserMusic is also A+ with a bit of retro-esque beep tunes mixed in.

No it doesn't matter which ship I'd use because it'll inevitably end with the ship exploding, possibly even in the first sector.I guess I'm just into that kind of stuff.10/10 would foolishly confront giant alien spiders again.

												Honestly, at the onset it's not exactly a game I thought I'd enjoy. However, at the time of publishing this review I have logged somewhere in the neighborhood of 430 hours...because it is so infinitely variable and simple (yet as strategic and complex as a randomly generated game can be!) I've unlocked *all* of the damnable quests, lost crew members that actually had developed skills to horrible infestations of giant spiders (a quest you can, of course, opt out of pursuing...but where's the fun in that?) Probably not quite what the developers had in mind when they made it, but...FTL is my go-to game when I have time constraints (i.e. kids needing to go to school in half an hour, or dinner to make, et cetera) because I can pretty much always walk away but pick up where I left off without having to overthink a next move.Also...ALWAYS explore when given the option. You can always repair your silly ship later if it doesn't pan out. And crew is expendible, after all. Just don't sell out to the stupid slavers, ever! "

												Amazing game. It's a rougelike adventure where you are at the helm of a ship that is carrying information vital to the survival of the remaining Federation fleet; the last remaining hope for the federation after their crushing defeat from the Rebels. You will have your ups and downs, sometimes escaping death by less than a second, just to have all your success of escaping near death crush down on you when the next ship you encounter happens to be a Mantis war vessel armed to the teeth. You may lose and you may find the game to be a bit harsh at times, but it can be assured that you will always come back and try to save the Federation from the verge of defeat with what little is at your disposal, time and time again. 9/10			"

												Everyone knows about FTL in some form or fashion, its a household name by this point in time.  It is a 2D topdown stratagy game, and also a Roguelike game, that features permadeath and random chance.  No two play throughs are the same.  You also have the ability to unlock other ships of other races to try new tactics, each ship has its own uniquie challenge and twist to add to the game.  However sometimes the game screws you from the start with a bout of bad luck, to unlock more ships often requires absurdly good luck while your blindly jumping around trying to get everything you need.

												FTL: Faster Than Light. A strong name for an originally overlooked game, This deep-space expedition of a game will have it's up and downs that have you at full power one game and struggling to survive against rebel ships, impeding fire, destroyed stystems, or breach in the hull of your very own ride out of here the next... and the weapons systems and overall controls are amazing! The thing that really defines this game as different from spacey games like it is that it does use the mouse and all it's functions, but at the same time it uses many key commands defined as a ""rogue-like"" setup; and if at first you don't get it, this game is a quick catch that will have you wanting to truly explore all of its secrets... not everything is given away with fake, cheesy surprise like, ""Oh! you found a new planet!"". The twists and turns and endlessly fun challenges provided by this game--once truly looked into--will make anybody want to play it non-stop. And to top my raving review on one of the biggest factors that make this rogue-like game truly unique... You can immediately and constantly pause this real-time strategy battle to adjust split-second decision tweaks to make your commanding experience follow your own commanding pace... SO HOP TO IT! This game is such a good buy, and the gameplay HOURS AND HOURS you will get out of it will nock your bucking socks off. BUY IT FOR THE SAKE OF AWESOMENESS. Plasma out.			"

												FTL is one of those games that will kick your ♥♥♥ 97% of the time, and the weirdest part is, you'll actually enjoy it.The graphics of this game are simple, which means pretty much anything can run it. Even my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop that used to get like 20 FPS in Terraria. Yet, don't be fooled with that, sometimes the backdrops are pretty good looking.The music of this game is pretty awesome too, from slow, calm songs to stuff that quickly escalates when you're in the middle of a fight. The sound effects are simple, and it's quite easy to recognize different mechanisms or weapons. The gameplay revolves mostly around micromanaging and strategy. Your weapons, your crew, your bots, they are mostly controlled by you. And sometimes, it's hard to take control of them during the heat of the battle. You also gotta plan your route carefully. Risky, but with a high chance of getting useful stuff? Or not risking it, but being unprepared in the face of danger when a raider ship demands your stuff? But when you get used to it, and you do it smoothly, it feels good, man. The difficulty of this game is truly remarkable. Everything wants you dead. Everything can go wrong. Is there something that can go wrong? Well, it's going to go wrong for you. You try to help people just to get backstabbed by raiders, you send your people to help and one of your crew dies to a spider attack or a plague, or you want to trade just to get yourself killed and looted. What's that? You don't want to help anybody? That's pretty good, but the game will find a way to ♥♥♥♥ you up, somehow. Like spawning a huge battleship that's way more equipped than you are, ripping you apart before you manage to escape. .....And this is on easy difficulty. This game is truly amazing, and I'd go as far as to say that it is an essential steam title. It's quite cheap, too. And after 40+ hours of gameplay, I've only reached the final boss twice. So, it's probably going to give you a lot to do.			"

												Faster Than Light is a must-have for tactical genre fans, and also those who likes the terms ""crew management"" and ""spaceship management"".In FTL, you are a runaway Galactic Federation ship carrying critical information that must escape the evil Rebels and reach the allied Federation fleet some sectors away.It features a top-down view, and battles are fought in real-time but can be paused using spacebar, to issue orders analyze the situation.You can upgrade the ship's modules using scrap acquired from destroying or capturing enemy ships, as well rewards from random events that happens once you arrive at a new point in space.There's shops in which you can buy equipment, crew, fuel and ammunition.The crew management is simple: there are ship consoles for each ship system module, and a console manned by one of your crew provides bonus to it's module - 25% in shields regeneration, for instance.Different races have different traits. For example: while the Humans are generic (blah, HUmans), the Mantis have a nice bonus on Close Quarters Combat - the ultimate boarders.During the battles, you can choose which room of the enemy ship your weapons should hit. Weapons vary from lasers to different kinds of missiles, bombs, cannons and also drones with different uses (repair, defense, attack, etc).Late in the game you can also equip yourself with Teleport and Cloaking modules, enabling you to invade and eliminate the enemy ship's crew using the teleport, and render yourself invisible for a few seconds using the cloak, being invulnerable to enemy targeting.And don't forget about the subsystems: Sensors, Medbay and your Doors!Leaving them broken will let your enemy run around freely inside your ship, enabling them do destroy your Oxygen system to suffocate your crew into Permadeath (yes - crew Permadeath and savegame Permadeath)!9/10, the only thing FTL doesn't provide is a continous-play mode (aka sandbox), but that doesn't affect the amazing piece of gaming art the developers delivered at all.

												Restart #112, finally got some luck and a good crew going. Hit the 4th area and feeling like I am finally going to beat this game.  Next encounter, Mantis board my ship and blow up my oxygen generator and half my systems. I finally blow up there ship and kill the boarding party. Sadly my oxygen is depleting fast. I send my crew to repair but it's too late, everyone is slowly suffocating to death and I don't get it repaired in time....#$&@*$*@Restart #113. First and second area cleared and moving to third, need fuel badly. Run out of fuel and get attacked by some pirates. I beam my boarding party on to their ship and start attacking internally, I clear most of the enemies but I've been focusing on the boarding party to much and when I look over at my ship I see it's mostly a ball of fire. I finish taking the enemy ship and beam my crew back but the teleporter room is on fire and my crew dies before I can get them out. They were still hurt from the fight before.....I still have my pilot on board so I open my external doors and vent out all the oxygen to get the fire out, Ok fire is out but I forget the fact that my pilot needs oxygen to live...and the oxygen generator is down.....Restart #114Best Rogue like I have ever played.

It's a really satisfying game if you do get good enough at it, but it's about 10 times more frustrating when you get 2 hours into a run and you lose because of a stupid mistake or because the game just didn't give you the right stuff.  Literally the only game I rage at, and the only game I keep coming back to after ragingEdit:  After 62 HOURS (over a good long while) I've finally beat the game.  On easy...  EASY!  I'll be playing this game more, and hopefully beating it on the higher levels of difficulty.http://steamcommunity.com/id/fritzpud/screenshot/48728490558739955 "

												FTL is an addictive, challenging game with fun RPG elements and surprisingly deep strategy.The difficulty level has an amazing balance to it that most ""roguelike"" games fail at - VERY tough at first while you learn the mechanics then quickly settles down to a sweet spot of constant tension and challenge but never frustration. Each playthrough becomes a narrative of highs and lows as crewmembers die, new ones join, your ship takes a beating, you get it repaired, you run from a nasty fight, you gain a new weapon, etc etc until your ultimate success or demise. Replayability of the game is high with various ships to unlock, lots of weapons to find, different strategies to try out and of course the random generation of a new galaxy each run.The game is 90+/100 for me, missing only steam achievements and leaderboards to take it higher. Highly recommend to any fan of strategy or RPG games.			"

												FTL: Faster than Light took a while for me to actually purchase, I've always heard stories about it and seen several videos. But once I finally got my hands on it, I couldn't let FTL go.It's one of these games I have difficulties with even on easy, and I always come back to this game.FTL is definately on my top 10, I greatly recommend it to anyone interested in sci-fi.

A Paladin's Review: FTL: Faster Than Light. The Creator of Its Own Genre for A Reason.Genre: 2D Strategy Sci-Fi Rogue-Like. Developed & Published by: Subset GamesPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux and Mobile.Business Model: Base Game + Free ExpansionCopy Gifted By A Friend Read the full and unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsI had seen this game get featured in various articles before its release and I'll admit that I kind of let this game slip under my radar until after release. Since this happened, I've been working on ways of preventing this from happening in the future. But I digress. After seeing what the game was about post-launch, I was interested in picking the game up very soon though lack of funds prevented me from getting the game initially. Thankfully, a good friend of mine gifted me the game. FTL: Faster Than Light is a rogue-like, real-time spaceship simulator. In FTL, you must fly your spaceship through hostile space, fight pirates, make diplomatic decisions, and avoid losing your entire crew and/or ship to the cold blackness of space. This game has you flying through various sectors of space collection equipment and scrap (currency) to improve the ship as well as meeting new races and seeing new regions of space. All the while, you must outrun the Rebel fleet that is trying to catch you before you reach the waiting Federation fleet. The Story and Gameplay.You're the captain of a starship for the Federation fleet that is being pursued by the overwhelming Rebel fleet. Why? Because you've learned important tactical information on how to defeat the Rebel fleet. You must deliver this information through a harrowing gauntlet of star systems and planets, avoiding overwhelming danger and surviving the odds. There are eight very dangerous sectors of space before you arrive at the Federation's Last Stand. There are up to four different paths you can take in each sector where a randomly generated situation will either benefit or debilitate your situation. After surviving the eight sectors, you'll join up with the Federation fleet to take on the invading Rebel fleet. At which point you must attack the Flagship of the Rebels directly while the Federation fleet attacks the Rebel fleet itself. Its game over if your ship or crew die at any point. For the most part, your choices have immediate consequences which will build up over time and may lead to success or failure. There are only a couple of choices you can make that will affect anything in the long-term. Generally, there are the prerequisites to acquiring new cruisers.Each new cruiser you acquire is built and balanced differently from each other to fit a certain play-style. Some are better at stealth, some have better offensive weapons and some are better at taking over the enemy ship or removing all of the crew members. Each cruiser also comes with a B-layout that changes what crew, weapons and modules are included on your ship as well as the color of the ship. There is a great variety of ships for FTL, its just unlocking them can take a long time. When starting the game you get to choose the ship, the layout, the name of the ship and the name of your initial crew, as well as which gender your Human crew are. You can also choose the difficulty setting easy or normal. However, I think they mislabeled these and its more like hard and insane. Not that its a bad thing, but ""normal"" is not as easy as you would think in most games. Once you've done all this, your ready to start out on your adventure through the stars. You can choose which planet you get to jump to from the galaxy map. Just keep in mind that every jump you make means that the rebels come that much closer to catching up to you. Even if they do, you can fight them off. Its generally not recommended because the only reward you'll get for beating them is one unit of fuel and no scrap. Scrap is the currency you use to repair your ship, buy new weapons and other miscellaneous items.While the main story may not be that strong, the real story is the journey you take in this harsh universe. Will you lose most of your crew in a freak accident only to survive all the way to the last sector on a wish and a prayer? Or will you escape from a sun's solar flare only to jump into an asteroid field and watch as your ship gets ripped apart by the asteroids and the nearby pirate's lasers? Or do you send your crew down to a randomly planet's distress call only to lose some of them as they are attacked by rebel forces? The story is played out with a lot of different text screens as you jump from one place in the galaxy map to the next. You'll encounter many different races, each with their own set of needs and personalities which you'll then have to decide what's best for your ship's continued survival. That's the fun with games like this is that you get to create the story in your head as you go along. It happened more than once that I would say ""ENGAGE"" at my monitor as my ship escaped a brutal battle or mourned over the loss of a comrade who bravely defended invading forces from taking over the ship. So, while the base story might not be much, its what you create from the universe that will really engage your interest in the game.Advanced Edition ThoughtsFTL: Advanced Edition fleshes everything about the game out, it's that simple. The new alien race adds a new mechanic where they suck the air out of the room they are in. There's new ships as well. It also comes with more music, weapons, encounters to overcome and UI enhancements to boot. It's a free expansion so no reason not to enjoy it. It can be disabled if you're wanting the vanilla FTL experience. PC SettingsFTL's settings are a bit lacking. You only have a few options to control the size of the game on your screen. Those included are: windowed mode, full-screen (stretched), full-screen (black borders) and full-screen (FTL's native resolution) which is not your monitor's resolution. You also have no control over key bindings, though the default keys are pretty smartly placed. There are also a bunch of other minor settings you can enable or disable to your liking and you can see in the screenshot above. Overall, my biggest criticism of the settings choices would be the lack of resolution options as I'm not a bit fan of the current ones but they should work well enough for you. The game also features a good tutorial to get you up to speed on how to play. There is also a Stats screen which contains your best performance and achievements for each ship you've flown. The game is well polished as far as being free from any bugs or crashing problems are concerned. Final ThoughtsFTL is a fantastic game and I don't think I'm saying anything new there. There's plenty of content and challenge, as I got 30 hours out of it. Though the RNG can easily ruin a run and I'd classify it as overly harsh, but there's something to enjoy every run. It's one of the few games that genuinely gives the feeling of being a starship captain. If your looking for a starship simulator that is an enjoyable, simple, and well crafted experience, then give FTL: Faster Than Light a look. This became my Game of the Year in 2012.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com] "

												Rogue-likes: the randomized frontier.FTL's randomness makes for some incredibly entertaining gameplay as you attempt to make the most of your trip from one side of the galaxy to the other to save the Federation, all while being chased by looming, innumerable rebel forces.You will extermish pirates to varying degrees of glee and bitterness. You will guide that lost civilian to their destination, find out it was a rebel trap, and smile. You will relish every victory.You will have to sell that Burst Laser III so you can upgrade your engines. You will open that Mantis escape pod because you are desperate for someone who can board ships. You will lose the last bit of your ship's HP to an unfortunately timed missle. Failing to make it to the end of a roughly 6-hour playthrough is what makes your victories significant.FTL is visually very simple, a hallmark of its indie production, but as much as it could benefit from a bigger-than-1280x800 resolution or perhaps even 3D graphics, I love how I can run it on my integrated graphics laptop.FTL is a tremendous value and important landmark in the history of crowdfunded games. Were I to wake up in an alternate universe where I had yet to create a Steam account, I would buy FTL again, for around three incarnations, anyway.			"

												After spending a few hours on this game I can already wholeheartedly recommend it. It's an indie game, so don't expect great graphics, but what you can expect is gameplay that will blow you away, a great soundtrack and an addiction to playing. You can restart the game countless times and the path will never be the same. Battles are nice and sometimes you have to think twice or even three times what is the best position for the laser, what room to hit, should I kill the crew? et cetera. There are some hidden ways of obtaining new ships or crew so even after hours of playing you will not know or have everything. The game can be hard, or even frustrating at times (even if you know how to play the game), knowing is only half the battle and in this case, thinking is the other.Bottomline, if you are looking for a great singleplayer indie game you won't be disappointed. 10/10			"

												This highly addictive spaceship- and crewmanagement simulation puts you in a spaceship captain's seat. Your goal is to deliver vital information to Federation's HQ passing eight more or less hostile sectors. You will micromanage your crew, adjust powersupply to your various systems, fend off boarding parties, put out fires,... while desperately waiting for your FTL-Drive to charge. Always one jump ahead of the rebel fleet pursuing you and permadeath (no save and load beside a save and quit) waiting in the next sector.			"

												I cannot recommend this game enough. With the hundreds of randomly generated encounters and the constant stress of possible permadeath constantly looming over your head, you're going to play this game 100 times over. A lot of hard to unlock content and for everything you unlock a second version to unlock. The replayability of this game is enormous because it's never the same game twice. Pick this up and lose your soul for a while. Its really worth it.			"

If you don't like to lose, don't buy this game. You. Will. Lose. So. Much. I LOVE a good challenge and I don't mind losing, so it's not a problem for me. Some people may look at this game and think ""Feh, looks easy."" You were saying? Yeah, there's an easy mode, BUT IT'S NOT EASY. I played 2 days of non-stop FTL of just trying to get to the final boss. When I finally got there, he munched me right up and spat me back out in about 3 seconds. Nontheless, I eventually beat him twice, but still. This game's a real challenge. Buy it now, captain your starship, save the Federation. Oh, and lose about 60 bajillion times.My ratings:Plot: 10/10 (It's random event results based, every time you jump to a new area a text based event comes up and the outcome changes every time, so you may gain a crew member one time and lose a crew member to the exact same scenario another time)Controls/HUD: 8/10 (Very easy to figure out where everything is and what is what, hotkeys don't make much sense without reconfiguration)Graphics: 10/10 (pixel-y graphics = win)Challenge: ∞/10 (Self-explanatory?)Total: ∞ + 28/40BUY THE GAME!

★★★★★One of the best games I've played in the last 10 years. Though I don't like Star Trek, I can see how fans of those series can totally dig this. I don't play ithe game as often as it encourages you to, but I do still listen to de amazing soundtrack almost daily. It's a great mix of action, micromanaging, exploration and (ad-hoc) planning. It's deep, engaging, interesting, rewarding but also punishing. This game made a footprint in the gaming industry as you can see the rogue-like aspects (and the managing) everywhere nowadays.It's worth every cent it's asking, no matter if it is the mobile version or the Steam version.

												This game is glorious, but can be difficult and punishing. On your first play, your ship is probably going to be destroyed, your entire crew is going to die, and you just don't know how you are supposed to survive the harsh realities of intergalactic space travel.Be sure to do easy mode the first few play-throughs while you figure how it works. Normal difficulty is really hard and you will probably starve for resources somewhere around sector five or six.I initially thought this game did not have much replayability, but I was wrong. Playing with the different ships and configurations can be a real challenge and encourages different play styles.			"

												If you don't own this game, frankly, you're missing out. It's an incredibly satisfying experience, and I get hooked every time I start it up. Expect to lose. A lot. But don't feel bad about it; dying is half the fun in this game! You learn better strategies as you keep playing (and inevitably being blown to bits), and once you finally beat the final boss... you're just on top of the world. I'm not a big fan of games that rely on luck as much as this game does, but this game is too much fun for me to care. ...Or at least justify having to care. It constantly makes you think and it rewards clever thinking. Just about anyone can have fun with this game; it's well worth the investment, even at full price.			"

												Ship log #4F-T55A7LWe were given something special to help aid in the fight against the rebels, Despite the Federations plight, we were it's sole hope of triumph.Throughout the kestrels travels many crew members had assisted in the fight against the rebel fleet in various battles through Engi space, to an uncharted nebula.But none of us could have foreseen the great doom that which was a mere science lab.Hidden beyond it's fancy air-lock were seven madmen in coats who had somehow turned the captain against the kestrels very own crew.Before the crew knew what had happened, the captain began punching Cubin and the rest had descended upon various subsystems.Amidst the battle two other crew members were taken from us, Tomas punched to death beside the FTL drive and Nelis asphyxiated in the weapons bay.Relentless with reckless abandon, the lab-coated madmen pursued Cubin and Martin to the med-bay only to suffocate and drop lifelessly in the mid-deck one by one.Cubin and Martin retreated to the medical bay fighting a losing battle, healing their asphyxiation in a now completely decompressed kestrel.This is the ships computer logging off.Rebel : These were the last recordings aboard the Kestrel, Should i delete them sir?Rebel leader : Oh no no, this is hilarious! Broadcast this through the entire Galaxy! But uhh.. what happened to the survivors?Rebel: We destroyed the med-bay and watched.*collective chuckle*Rebel leader : You're all promoted!10/10 would check a science lab again.			"

												This is a game about little space dudes trying to save their space empire from the evil space rebels, only to find that they run out of missiles on some dumb automated scout who's shields are too tough for their burst laser II to get through. So then they're sitting there waiting for their FTL drive to charge so they can jump away, hoping that their own shields hold, when the automated scout gets a missile through and hits their cockpit. So now their FTL is delayed, and the cockpit is on fire, and the mantis that was piloting the ship is trying his darnedest to put out the fire that's slowly killing him (but you know that giant space mantis has a hard time holding a fire extinguisher, so he'll die before the fire goes out). So the guy at weapons control heads to the cockpit to help, but since he's a rock dude he takes 15 years to get there. And while he's on his way, the mantis has had to leave before being cooked, heading to the med bay. So now the fire is spreading, entirely engulfing the cockpit and the hallway outside of it. The mantis, upon reaching the med bay, is surprised to find that it's not working because power has been routed from it to supply the weapons systems. So they reroute power to the med bay, taking it from the O2 supply. But don't worry, they'll bring that back up before everyone suffocates, hopefully.The rock dude has finally made it to the cockpit and is stomping out the fire, when another missile hits the shield generator and the shields go offline. Right as the shields go down, a halberd beam rips across the ship, hitting mostly empty rooms, but causing the automated warning sirens to alert the crew that hull integrity is down to 50%. Immediately, the remaining crew abandon their posts and rush to the shield room to get them back online. All of a sudden, the internal view screens go dark as the sensors are knocked offline by another missile.The crew is panicking now. The rock dude, having finally put out the fire, is starting repairs on the navigational systems (though the crew still wonders how a large humanoid rock man can fix a computer terminal by simply hitting it, but hey, whatever works). Repairs to the shields are around 50%, so they come partially online, stopping the halberd beam. The automated drone, knowing no sympathy (or any emotion for that fact), continues it's relentless assault. Missiles continue to hit the ship, some tearing holes in the hull, others starting more fires. The rock dude makes his final repairs and brings navigation back online. It's only got another minute or so before it resolves the jump trajectory, but the crew isn't sure if they have that long.Another explosion and siren sounds, this time signaling hull integrity at 25%. The shields are now fully online, and the mantis is back at the helm. There seems to be a shred of hope after all. The rock dude heads off to the sensor room to figure that mess out. Explosions continue to rock the ship; another missile strike to the shields (bringing them back down), and another halberd beam across the weapons systems. No shields, no weapons, and the only human on the crew is pretty sure that if she sneezes the whole ship will break apart.This is when the crew realizes that they never brought the O2 back online. They try to route power to it, but the O2 control was hit by a missile and is offline. And the room is on fire, along with a good portion of the rest of the ship. The crew will never know this though, because the sensors are still offline (the rock dude is sill on his way). No oxygen, an unrelenting missile barrage, and the heat from the out of control fire sap the rest of the hope from the crew. Will they make it?Probably not. But one thing is certain; they'll try again. And again. And again. Each journey a new adventure, a new story to be told. And maybe they'll get through to the end, to warn their friends in the space empire about the impending doom they all face.Or maybe they'll have all their doors open when the door control is hit by a missile and all the oxygen rushed into space. That'll happen at least once too.			"

ALWAYS. First it's him getting left behind on a space station full of cannibals, then him getting sniped by an anti-bio beam on his way to the med-bay, and even him just dying because I left him in a part of the ship with no oxygen for too long.

												If you don't own this game, you are missing out. FTL is a true gem of a game, something playable by people of all skill levels, with enough challenge and replayability to provide hundreds of hours of gameplay. My ONLY complains is the lack of consistency. I get a surrender offer for 6 fuel, 4 missiles, and 15 scrap..... I kill the crew leaving the ship intact, and there's 1 fuel 1 drone part, and 30 scrap. And various other events where RNG rewards create weird situations. THE only complaint. Everything else about the game is pure gold, and this one factor is very minimal but noticible. If you are offered a good surrender, take it, the kill or freely scavenging rewards may not be as good. Other than that, best of luck and have fun!

												Games such as FTL: Faster Than Light have been few and far between.  A proper rougelike, you never know what will happen during a run, and short of a proper ship layout, some luck, and a high level of skill, you probably won't get far often.  However, like any good roguelike, FTL isn't about winning everytime.  Too many games nowadays have no consequence for death.  This is all well and good in some ways, but we need more games like this one to make us genuinely try.As for the gameplay itself, I couldn't be more satisfied.  A mix of real-time and something like turn-based gameplay (you can pause the action at any time and set up what will happen next) give you the time to react to a situation as you see fit, but how you react and how it is timed is essential.  Will your weapon charge and fire, knocking out theirs before they can fire back; or should you aim instead at their shield room to make certain that your future volleys get through?  Will draining the oxygen from the engine room put out the fire before they are destroyed; or should you risk your men in the blazing room to put it out and keep that engine running?  Is that heavily guarded ship worth it, or should you sneak past?Enjoy your runs in FTL.  My advice?  Avoid giant spiders.			"

												When I describe this game to others I always mention the starting bit of Star Wars: A New Hope. You remember the ship that Princess Leia was in? She was trying to escape from the evil guys behind her.That's basically FTL in a nutshell. It's a game that gives you a lot of fun, but also a lot of nervous breakdowns. When you lose half of your crew because you wanted to help a station in distress, you quickly become a class 1 space ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and start ignoring all those cries for help.The game is surprisingly hard, something I didn't see since I was a kid (mid '90s), took me a long time to see the final boss, only to get humiliated by him in 30-45 seconds.Great game! :)			"

												FTL Faster Than Light is a rogue-like with the added twist of being set in space and based around ship management. The gameplay involves you mainly micromanaging your spaceship and crew as you travel through a number of random encounters trying to reach the other side of the map so you can deliver a warning to your rebel headquarters and defeat the final boss.FTL is a game that relies heavily on it's difficulty, being much shorter than your average rouge-like. You manage a number of fairly limited resources as you slowly improve your ship and crew. You gather fuel, missiles and money and hope for new and better weapons and drones as your crew members gain experience in whatever field they are working.It is a well made game and one I'm happily recommending but it's also a game that has some rather annoying limitations.Your ship has very little customization options which makes repeat playthroughs somewhat dull, an unusual trait for a rouge-like. Choosing a different ship often yields much the same gameplay as even though your starting position changes a little, the only real change longterm is the configuration of the various rooms on your ship.Another problem is the relatively short campaign you will begin to take note of once you've learned the basics and only the unforgiving higher difficulty gives it any sort of longevity.All in all FTL: Faster Than Light is a nice little game, but it is also a game that needs something more before I'll agree with the underdog hype that seems to be going around everywhere these days. Perhaps strong developer support and a growing modding community will one day make this into the game it could be but as it sits now it is nothing special.			"

												It's Dungeons Of Dredmor and The Binding Of Isaac but  in space. Faster Than Light is a roguelike game, meaning that if you die, it's truly game over. There's no reloading savegames, checkpoints, anything. You have to start all over again, except for a few things (like new ships or layouts) that you'll unlock during your games.The whole game is randomly created so you'll never play the same game twice. There's also a bit of micromanaging. Scrap the 'bit' part, in reality it's pretty important and you'll micromanage your crew in practically every battle. Your crew will have to repair important parts of your ship and setting them up correctly might make them reload your weapons faster, or recharge your shields faster. They'll even have to engage enemies in combat from time to time. Killed enemies will give you resources to upgrade your ship and buy stuff in shops. Stuff you desperately need in order to advance. In fact, soms of us might never even be able to complete the game, considering the fact that things are entirely random and it's also based on lots of luck. But it will never stop you from quitting the game. It's always fun, no matter what happens to your ship. You'll keep telling yourself; 'just one more game'. And isn't that what a game's supposed to do?FTL is a great game and anyone who gives it a try will absolutely learn to appreciate it. Maybe not instantly, but after a few games ?

												This game is really fun and challenging when you start playing it becuase you can feel that the game mechanics give it a lot of depth and you wan't wait to learn how the game works so you can figure out how to win and develop strategies. But as you keep playing it, you slowly begin to realize how wrong you were, and that the reality is there is no depth to the game because everything that happens depends almost entirely on luck and how little anything you actually do matters.You can play flawlessly, making all the right decisions, buying all the right upgrades to turn your ship into the perfect combat vessel that can dodge most shots, has the shields to absorb whatever manages to get through and still has a powerful enough armament to destroy anything you come across, but it won't matter because in the next battle suddenly you will be forced into a situation that is literally impossible to survive. This isn't fun, this isn't good gameplay, it's just terrible game design (or lack thereof) and I really wish people would stop making excuses for games whose developers bought into the fallacy that ""everything determined by RNG = hard = good game"" because it never works.And the most frustrating thing is that this is by no means a bad game. It is otherwise very well designed and is actually really fun as long as the RNG isn't arbitrarily killing you off. The only thing the game has to do to improve is to reduce the supremacy of the RNG in determining everything that happens and to let the player's actions have more influence. I don't care if they leave in a ""hardcore mode"" or call less random mode ""baby difficulty"" or whatever, I just want to enjoy playing a game.			"

No bugs, music is great, you're always on the edge of your seat, EXTREMELEY CHALLENGING, but in a good way, Normal is Hard, Hard is Very Hard, and Very Hard is (near) impossible. Fast responses, runs great on low end computers, doesnt't take that much space to download, and the list goes on and on.

												FTL is a game that you WILL die to, and that should definitely not make you quit. Due to this game's AMAZING replayability, every run will be different, you will never have the exact same run, which is exciting in every form.The music is definitely rememberable, for a small team of course.Ever since Advanced edition came out, the game has even more to offer, you can even alter your playing style, do you prefer sheer weapon power, Boarding tactics, or do you want a mass drone army?The game offers many variety of ships, from the default Kestral to the Lanius cruiser, each with their own unique playing style which is sure to fit some people!The line is, FTL is an amazing game, it's not for someone that doesn't likes its genre, but if you like Rogue Indie games, get this masterpiece. You won't regret it.			"

												FTL is a pretty tough game that requires a fair bit of thought and a lot of patience. Don't be put off by the old school graphics and assume that its just a crappy cheap game, it isn't. I've had many hours of fun with this game and that's even when i was failing to get passed the boss. It took me months to complete a game that can be completed in a few hours and i think that just goes to show how good a game it is that i never raged quit the whole thing and put it back on the shelf. When you finally complete the game its the best thing ever and the amount of versatility in the game will keep you coming back for more. Oh, and there's different difficulty settings if 'easy' wasn't hard enough!			"

												This is an awesome [enter Sci Fi franchise of your choice here] emulator. You command a ship that is fleeing an enemy fleet and you have limited resources in order to cross vast swathes of the galaxy. You cannot save everyone and people are going to die. You can be good or bad and the consequences are largely random (rather then getting the usual short-term boosts for evil and long term boosts for good). Even on easy it takes a while to get out of the first stages. It has the best, most desperate, moments of BSG and DS9. Here are a few decisions I have had to make while playing:- Should I flush my engineer into space to put out a fire or should I have my crew rush to his aid while I am in the middle of a fire fight?- Should I replace my engineer with an ill-begotten slave from a slave trader?- Should I allow that slave ship I am attacking to bribe me not to attack them because I am in perilous shape and need the supplies?- How long can I afford to suffocate my crew for?It is great, cheap, and it works on Linux.

												This game is a very well polished extension of the Roguelike genre. You pick a ship from a number of different designs each with their strengths and weaknesses, and are sent forth through a series of randomly generated star systems in the hopes of becoming powerful enough to destroy the Federation Flagship. However, instead of training a single character as you progress through the game, you improve your entire ship, its subsystems, its weapons and the crew within it.The game's charm lies within both its superb soundtrack which magnificently serves to highlight the action in the game, and its implementation of the game's different races and weapon types.

												In my honest opinion, FTL is amazing.When it was the standard edition I thought it was pretty good, and I still put quite a few hours into it, but to me it felt like it was just a little lacking.  After playing through a few times, I had decided upon my normal strategy, and varied little through different play throughs.  That may not be a problem for some more adventurous gamers, but after finding something that worked I just wanted to stick with it.  For me, the advanced edition solved that problem.  I thoroughly enjoy the new race, the Lanius, although my favorite part is probably the expansion of the available weapons.  Missiles, lasers, ions and beams was a good start, but often I just wished there was a little more variety in those classes themselves.  I found myself always trying to find as many 'burst laser IIs' as I could, maybe with an occasional beam weapon.  Now, I really enjoy trying to decide between the chain lasers, normal lasers, scrap throwers and ion stunners, all of which I think add a great deal of new tactics and depth to the gameplay.  Overall, I think this game is very well done, totally worth the money, and the day they come out with an FTL 2, or let you battle your ships with other players I'm sure I'll be lost in deep space for a very long time.

												FTL is an insanely addictive roguelike indie game which requires the player to micromanage systems on a spaceship.  Surprisingly in-depth, FTL is akin to a real time strategy/simulation; although it is possible to pause and issue commands  when it becomes frantic in later levels. Being a roguelike game, FTL is very difficult. It will require a few hours and many attempts to formulate a strategy. FTL claims that ""death is a part of the fun"" and it will keep you saying ""just one more game"". The variety of unlockable ships, weapon combinations and random level generation further add depth and replayability. The only potential negatives are that some may find the inevitability of death and the randomness nature of the game frustrating. If you purchase FTL knowing that it is a true roguelike, you will have hours of fun.			"

												FTL is the beginning of a genre I hope, one of strategic spaceship games where you're ordering crew and trying your best to stay alive against all odds as fires spring up, enemies board, and everything goes to hell quickly. If you love those scenes in Star Trek or even in the more modern movies with battleships as the crew rushes to keep the thing afloat, you'll love the on-the-edge gameplay of FTL. With a good mix of skill, organization, and sheer luck you can pull off some amazing feats that leave you feeling accomplished. It also has one of the best soundtracks for any game I've ever played.			"

												Captain Picard is my favourite character, since he's a pretty faithful recreation. Worf is made out of rocks, for some reason, and they just decided to cut Riker altogether. It's recommended that you buy a replica Starfleet uniform and elevate your chair on some sort of platform before playing. Remember not to simply click the buttons, but to actively shout ""Divert power from the engines to the shield generator! Charge the main lasers!""

												It's a hard game to describe as it is simple and deep at the same time. One thing I'm sure of is that this game is beautiful, engaging and very fun. Random encounters, random shops, random events and even random galaxies make every single playthrough unique. The gameplay revolves around your tactical choices of managing a ship and their crew members, you can even hire aliens or acquire them by different means and the ship is highly customizable. Most of the events always give you a choice, and you even get bonus choices if you have a specific alien, weapon, resources or other things, that's a VERY appreciated RPG touch. The battle is simple, yet harder to master, you need to choose where the weapons should be shooting, is it wiser to take down their weapons, their shields, or their drones? Your call, and keep some crew to repair the damage. Overall, I'm really happy about this title, the trailer was great, but the game inside is so much more, truly an indie master piece.			"

												This game is brilliant.It looks simple, and it is, very simple, to learn to play. Mastering it, however, will take a lot longer.The game revolves around your ship, fleeing Rebel forces and trying to reach the Allied Fleet. You start off with a few crew, some minor weapons, and few empty spaces on your ship for improvements and new systems. How you develop from there is entirely up to you.You can use your scrap to upgrade your weapons, turning your ship into a powerful gunship. You have the options of buying new, stronger, weapons as the you locate stores, or traders. Or, if you are really lucky, you'll just find a random weapon floating in space.Or, perhaps you'd like to capture enemy ships instead of destroying them. Then you want teleporters, and Mantis crewmen. Mantis are the insectoid race, and they are excellent in combat. Beam them into your enemy's ship, and watch as they tear through the crew until the ship is yours.Of course, these are just two of the ways you can play this. With the Advanced Edition upgrade, you get new systems to play with, which provide you with even more options.On top of all this, there is the hangar. Even if you beat the boss, there are another 9 ship classes to check out, and most of those have three variants, so there is still loads to do.Then you have the various quests and missions to do, 8 randomly generated sectors of space to explore in each game, and even the chance of discovering a lost lost system... If you are lucky. All while on the run from the Rebel Fleet.In short, I highly recommend this game. FTL is loads of fun, and rather addictive. And even if you do get tired of playing (eventually), there are many, many mods out there for it which will change up your gameplay.			"

												I didn't think I would enjoy this game but I do. I'm hooked.I thought that the fast-paced strategy would be chaotic and difficult to master. I was pleased to find out that you can pause the action at any moment and give orders, and that the mechanics are very simple and easy to understand. That doesn't mean that FTL is an easy game: plenty of choices and their consequences, as well as the random-generation make it quite the opposite. The game is never unfair to the player, giving many opportunities for upgrades and pacing the zones quite well.Critical thought and planning ahead are as important as combat in FTL; saving some ""scrap"" (the games spending and upgrading currency) could mean the difference between bribing a hostile pirate or having to engage in combat. Spending your ""scrap"" on ship upgrades could mean that you run out of fuel later in the game, or it could be the bump that saves your crew's lives.The most aesthetically pleasing thing about FTL is the way it can be played with only a mouse. Pausing the action is bound to the middle mouse button, leaving your other hand free to grab a snack, pick your nose, or stratch that itch. More often you'll find yourself chewing on the nails of your free hand, as the action in FTL can get extremely tense in the latter stages.Overall, I would recommend FTL to anybody who enjoys difficult strategy games. Being a roguelite is also a huge plus for me. The art is great, the music is great, and there is a fairly high replay value with unlocks and achievements.A+			"

												What is there to say about FTL other than it is an amazing game that can provide you hours of limitless fun. The wide range of weaponry allows for a variety of play styles and can keep speedrunners and explorers alike entertained. The real gem is the games combat system which allows for on the fly tactical decision making that can impact the fate of your ship and her crew, all at the slip of misplaced energy bars.The graphics of the game are charming, and allow for those with lower end computers to enjoy the same fun as people with more expensive rigs. While it may be a turn-off for some, the simplified blocky art style showcases the gritty and fearful nature of the game and what lies beyond the great expanse of space Procedural generation makes it so that no 2 adventures are the same, however the same cannot be said about the specific encounters or battles as they will inevitably repeat themselves. This can become annoying over multiple playthroughs, but overall will not detract from the game as a whole.In conclusion, I would reccomend this game to someone who has always wanted to be at the helm of their very own starship, or someone who just needs a casual breakaway from your everyday AAA-cookie cutter title.Rating: 9/10			"

												FTL is pretty much everything you see on an episode of Star Trek.  That's literally what it is; Star Trek: The Game.  Want to divert power from weapons into shields?  By gum, you can.  Want to use your scanners to avoid enemy ships?  A valid strategy!  Do you not take a deal with the Slugs because they tend to rip you off?  Well, depends on how much you need it.Officially, FTL is a rouge-like-like.  Each round is short, usually playable in one sitting, and will vary from every other round immensely.  With fantastic music and brilliant story situations, I would highly recommend this to anyone that sees games above a simple entertainment venue as well as anyone who wanted to be Captain Kirk when they were a kid.  Both categories of people, and many more at that, will be completely satisfied.			"

												Let me just start off by saying that I adore this game any other roguelike I currently own. It's a fantastic piece of work that almost seamlessly melds roguelike and strategy that's unforgiving in the hands of a novice but nontetheless rewarding and worth replaying constantly. It has the best soundtrack of any indie game I've played thus far, and making it a dynamic soundtrack with idle and battle versions definitely helped that. The writing is also interesting and clever, and definitely making it worth a try for any fan of sci-fi. Advanced Edition, the recent free expansion, expands upon the game's content by at least a third and adds yet another reason to get back at it.Regardless, I've come to dread the end level. Strategy and luck seem to go out the window in favor of luck alone. Your only real hope at winning is having fully upgraded almost everything, and if you don't have the right weapons and/or equipment you cannot hope to last the three phases of the boss. The boss presents no surprise and beating it becomes pretty formulaic. The Advanced Edition upgrades help mix it up a little and make it just a little less mind-numbing, but it still puts a dent in an otherwise near-perfect title.9.5/10			"

												I absolutely love this game and have poured hours into it. FTL has so many amazing features, my favourite being the many different paths one can take to develop your ship to destroy your enemies in various ways. You can disable/destroy their oxygen thereby suffocating them, transport your crew into their ship and kill them from the inside, set fires throughout their ship that will eventually consume them or simply destroy their hull.  The games mechanics are almost flawless, but the storyline needs some work. In fact I pay no attention to it when I perform a run since it is the same everytime. IMO there should either be multiple storylines, or one that explains the multiple runs, like in Spelunky for instance.All in all this greatest flaw that I can see takes little from the game, and I highly suggest buying it.

												Aside from Metal Slug, there aren't many pixel-graphic games that I enjoy. I know, I shouldn't go around judging games based on their graphics, and I don't. I just haven't played many pixelized games.The game itself is pretty good, it's rather strategic. The goal is to navigate your way to the boss, fighting through all sorts of randomly generated areas and enemy ships, with your ship. You have control of individual crewmembers, and those have different characteristics depending on what race (species?) they are. These crewmembers have different roles, all systems and weapons need crew manning them to be usable, and there has to be a pilot at the helm or your ship cannot dodge any attacks at all. Enemy crew can invade your ship, and your people have the ability to fight them off. Systems, weapons, and the hull can be damaged, and the crew has the ability to repair them all. While ship shapes are unchangable, there are a variety to unlock and some have special perks, and you have some options on what systems and weapons to place inside and on your ship, all of which impact your ship's combat capability. The boss is incredibly hard though. I've lost track of how many times I've gotten to it, but I've never beaten it once. It apparently has several stages, but I've only ever gotten past the first. In honesty, I'm not sure if $9.99 is worth a video game like this. Don't get me wrong, I love this game, but there's not very much in it and repetitiveness, for me, detracts from the appeal of a game. (I'm really iffy about prices for games... I don't think any game ever will be worth $60, unless inflation drives currency there.) I'd recommend this at full price, if you can totally spare the money, but if it's on sale? It's a great deal.Another thing I want to note is the game's music. The game itself is enjoyable, but the music is on another darn level. There was a time when I'd plug in both of my ear-phones, search up the soundtrack, and listen to it with my eyes closed. It literally gave me goosebumps and chills. I'm no expert in music or music analyzation, but I think this needs an award for its music. (Steam Awards, darn it.)I don't review often. I think this is my second or third time reviewing, and this may just be me rambling like an idiot, but thanks for sparing time to read through this.

												Aside from Metal Slug, there aren't many pixel-graphic games that I enjoy. I know, I shouldn't go around judging games based on their graphics, and I don't. I just haven't played many pixelized games.The game itself is pretty good, it's rather strategic. The goal is to navigate your way to the boss, fighting through all sorts of randomly generated areas and enemy ships, with your ship. You have control of individual crewmembers, and those have different characteristics depending on what race (species?) they are. These crewmembers have different roles, all systems and weapons need crew manning them to be usable, and there has to be a pilot at the helm or your ship cannot dodge any attacks at all. Enemy crew can invade your ship, and your people have the ability to fight them off. Systems, weapons, and the hull can be damaged, and the crew has the ability to repair them all. While ship shapes are unchangable, there are a variety to unlock and some have special perks, and you have some options on what systems and weapons to place inside and on your ship, all of which impact your ship's combat capability. The boss is incredibly hard though. I've lost track of how many times I've gotten to it, but I've never beaten it once. It apparently has several stages, but I've only ever gotten past the first. In honesty, I'm not sure if $9.99 is worth a video game like this. Don't get me wrong, I love this game, but there's not very much in it and repetitiveness, for me, detracts from the appeal of a game. (I'm really iffy about prices for games... I don't think any game ever will be worth $60, unless inflation drives currency there.) I'd recommend this at full price, if you can totally spare the money, but if it's on sale? It's a great deal.Another thing I want to note is the game's music. The game itself is enjoyable, but the music is on another darn level. There was a time when I'd plug in both of my ear-phones, search up the soundtrack, and listen to it with my eyes closed. It literally gave me goosebumps and chills. I'm no expert in music or music analyzation, but I think this needs an award for its music. (Steam Awards, darn it.)I don't review often. I think this is my second or third time reviewing, and this may just be me rambling like an idiot, but thanks for sparing time to read through this. Have a good day, evening, or night, and... uh... yeah... stuff.			"

												If anyone has played dungeon crawl, and liked it, this game is for you. While definitely not as hard as crawl, there will be many YASD moments (yet another stupid death). The game is heavily luck based, and usually one mistake will spell your destruction. It can be frustrating. If you don't like rouge-like difficulty then this is not the game for you.

												FTL is a game that is probably a pinnacle of certain individual's gaming enjoyment. A sci-fi, tactical, procedurally generated, customizable, spaceship game is something that I imagine quite a few people have been waiting for, even if they didn't realize it. The player takes the role of the crew of a small starship attempting to cover a certain distance of space to reach the Federation homeworld. The catch being that you are being pursued by rebel forces that are seeking to destroy you because you're carrying data that could result in the downfall of those forces. You jump from point to point interacting with rebel forces, pirates, science expeditions, galactic forces, etc., while attempting to maintian your position in front of the ever encroaching rebel force. Hijinks ensue.FTL is incredibly replayable, very challenging, rewarding, very engaging, and fun. For those who enjoy the genre it's a game that they will derive much enjoyment from, and for those who aren't sure of the genre, FTL is a great place to start. Great recommendation.			"

												Faster Than Light is a rouge like space game. The goal of FTL is to get through all 8 sectors and beat the boss. During your time travelling through each sector you will encounter many different situation that is randomly generated and will bring you to question what is more important. For example a ship is on fire do you want to risk a crew member to save them and get a certain reward. There is also shops which you can buy materials for the ship like fuel, rockets and drones. You can also buy extra equipment for your ship like a teleport and you can upgrade your ship increasing its chance of survival through out space. There are special crew members of different speices, new ships, challenges to improve replay value.  Rating 8/10 good buy for good night of gaming diffentlyworth £6.99 will spend many hours traveling through space fight of ships and upgrading ships.			"

												This is currently my favorite game in my entire Steam library.  I pour so many hours into this game it's starting to become a problem.FTL is a roguelike that puts you in control of your own federation starship on a mission to travel to and destroy the rebel flagship; sounds pretty easy right?.  Apparently, the rebels are winning because this federation has miniscule resources and as such you recieve a ship that's severely under-equiped for the job.  It is up to you, and your crew, to find the resources you need to make it to the end and defeat the flagship, a task that can be challenging even on the easiest difficulty.I refrain from calling it hard as it's really not as long as you make all the right decisions.  The word 'unforgiving' is a better description, as one mistake is all it takes to get a game over.  You can pause the game at any time during combat so there's no presure to fast click and multi-task in the heat of combat so the only reason failure is your own poor decision making, and that really appeals to me.Since you can name your ship and starting crew I'm tempted to call this ""Oregon Trail in Space"", and that's probably all I needed to say.  It has all the same appeal, difficulty, and unforgiving environment ""Oregon Trail"" had just that instead of choosing starting resources you choose a ship.			"

												It's a hard game to describe as it is simple and deep at the same time. One thing I'm sure of is that this game is beautiful, engaging and very fun. Random encounters, random shops, random events and even random galaxies make every single playthrough unique. The gameplay revolves around your tactical choices of managing a ship and their crew members, you can even hire aliens or acquire them by different means and the ship is highly customizable. Most of the events always give you a choice, and you even get bonus choices if you have a specific alien, weapon, resources or other things, that's a VERY appreciated RPG touch. The battle is simple, yet harder to master, you need to choose where the weapons should be shooting, is it wiser to take down their weapons, their shields, or their drones? Your call, and keep some crew to repair the damage. Overall, I'm really happy about this title, the trailer was great, but the game inside is so much more, truly an indie master piece.			"

A good amount of complexity with a dash of Star Trek randomness along with multiple paths/solutions really make this game shine.

												FTL is a very intresting and complex game, it's quite basic in terms of weapons, ships, races, sectors, and graphics. But that does not make it a basic game by any means, infact it can be the hardest game you have ever played and has almost unlimited replay value. Infact if told to, i probably would have payed double the asking price, its that good. It is a ship based game that takes place in a certain galaxy, and you, the captain need to guide your ship through 8 chalanging sectors, to save the galaxy. You have 9 completely different ships to chose from, each with their own different, races, layouts, weapons, designs, strategies, and of course types. There are currently 3 different layouts of each ship thus there are technicaly 29 different ships to chose from. Will you chose to go weapons heavy and obliverate anything that comes in your way,(limited by, luck.) or will you chose to methodicaly board and take out your enemies for better rewards the choice is usually yours. Luck is a huge factor in this game, but dont let luck control you! Be the bettter pilot and lead the Federation to victory!			"

												Disclaimer: Have you ever wandered trough Steam, checking out several games, their screenshots, checking them out to add to the wishlist (or buying them right there on the spot)? Well, I did. It was a cold winter sales, Steam made a huge sale on this game, the screenshots didn't promise much but since I'm generally hyped for Sci-Fi ships games I went away and got it. Well, it was cheap, it was indie (I like to support indie developers) so it wouldn't be a total loss. I downloaded the game (pretty small download) and the next few hours of my life were lost in this brilliant masterpiece.This game is an RTS/RPG mixture in wich you have your own ship and crew with minimalistic graphics, you travel trough space and sometimes you encounter some enemy ships (or you decide to turn hostile on them). You have to controll your crew and the game ends when they die. Pretty easy until here right? Now add up the fact that you have several modules on your ship, upgrades, money, fuel and ammunition. Getting more complex isn't it? Now add up the fact that you are prompted with most of the choices you have to do like, for example, you detect a ship who's requesting help, you go near it and they approach you with a question like: ""We got out of fuel, could you give us some?"" and then they prompt you with 2 choices: a) Give them the fuel (and wander if they'll give you something when you reach a safe spot or maybe you're just a good soul); b) Kill them and steal their money and ammunition. All of this and much more, make one of the most fun, innovative and immersive games I've played recently.Overall: 9/10Words can't describe this game at all. It's a immersive experience without using pretty graphics. Using it's own originality it conquered a space among most of the AAA games I've played and I don't regret a single penny from what I paid.PS: They upgrade everyone to Advanced Edition without asking for a single extra buck, +1 for that!

												Having played FTL through multiple times, and fallen in love with the game over and over, I can officially say you should take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt. With that out of the way, I love this game.StoryThe story of FTL is a simple, yet effective one, providing just enough backstory to set the player into the universe. The galaxy was controlled by the Federation, a coalition between humans and various other races, such as the robotic Engi, and the hyper-intelligent Zoltans, until the Rebellion came. Humans were fed up with being equal with other races, and led a successful rebellion against the Federation, all but destroying it. You are the commander of a small Federation cruiser, holding the only information that can help the Federation win the war. Your task is to fly through the galaxy, racing against the Rebels, to get to the last Federation base, and inform them of the weakness of the Rebel fleet.Gameplay:FTL is played from a top-down perspective, with you, the player, in control of a spaceship, requiring you to manage weapons, shields, engines, etc. to keep the ship alive in the depths of an unforgiving galaxy. When I say unforgiving, I mean unforgiving.  Just about everything is out to get you: Pirates, Rebel Ships, and Giant Alien Spiders make up only a tiny portion of the people who want to tear your ship apart peice by peice. You have to survive the constant onslaught with just your wits, carefully balancing your systems and crew to quickly end conflicts with as little damage as possible. In between events, you jump from point to point on a map of your current sector, which can hold shops, distress signals, and other miscellaneous warp points. As you travel through the galaxy, you'll acquire new crew, weapons, and systems to fight the ever-stronger enemies, in an arms race to the Federation Base, culminating into a final boss fight that will put your ship, and your skills, to the test. This game is not easy by any stretch of the imagination, and even on easy mode you will find yourself dying over and over. If you can get past the difficulty curve of the game, you'll find that it offers a very deep and rewarding experience, which will keep you coming back time and again.Visuals:The visuals in FTL are simplisitic, and two-dimensional, this doesn't mean that they are bad however. The game's art is fantastic, with the various ships, weapons, and aliens all having a unique look that suits their particular traits. The environments in this game are gorgious, with backgrounds of deep space, nebulae, and planets that never seem to get old.Writing:FTL's writing is funny, adding a bit of levity to an overall tense game. Many of the random events are incredibly out in left field, and the writing capitalizes on this, such as in the case of the aforementioned Giant Spiders. That said, the writing isn't all jokes, and also does a fantastic job of building the universe. In many of the encounters you are offered a chance to let enemy ships surrender, with really humanizes each encounter, and provides a moral dillemma with each ship you encounter. Often the rebels really aren't that dedicated to the cause, and are just average joes conscripted to help, and whether you should kill them or not is up to you.Music:One of the best aspects of this game is it's sound design. This game has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game, with beautiful ambient music to accompany the lulls in the action, and tense tracks during tough battles. All the music in FTL is very electronic, most easily described as a mix of Chiptune, Ambient, and Trance. The music is relaxing enough to play a long session without getting boring, and engaging enough to keep you on the edge of your seat during some of the harder fights in the game. The sound effects of the various weapons, crew, and environmental hazards all fit perfectly, and can repeat without ever sound grating or annoying. Overall, the sounds and music in FTL add just as much to the experience as the visuals, if not a bit more.Problems:For all that I've said about the game being fantastic, it does have a bit of a flaw that some people may find irritating. The way you unlock ships straddles the border between a good progress system, and an annoying grind, especially with many of the type B or random event ships. To unlock Type B cruisers, you must complete two of the corresponding ship's achievements, which can be anything from a normal run, to a pain in the ♥♥♥. (I'm looking at you Rock Cruiser.) On top of that, there's a secret ship owned by the crystal race which has two methods of unlocking: Complete a series of random events, dependent upon about fifty thousand different dice rolls going perfectly, or beat the game with every other ship's (excluding the new Lanius cruiser) Type A and Type B configurations.  That said, none of the ships are objectively better than the others, and are really just built to suit different playstyles.Final Thoughts:FTL is a great game that will provide hours of entertainment, for a bargain price of $10, about the same as going to a movie. If you feel that FTL might not be the game for you, I recommend waiting until it goes on sale to try it. For those of you intrigued by the concept of a spaceship simulator, or like strategy games, buy it. You won't be disappointed.			"

												It's a hard game to describe as it is simple and deep at the same time. One thing I'm sure of is that this game is beautiful, engaging and very fun. Random encounters, random shops, random events and even random galaxies make every single playthrough unique. The gameplay revolves around your tactical choices of managing a ship and their crew members, you can even hire aliens or acquire them by different means and the ship is highly customizable. Most of the events always give you a choice, and you even get bonus choices if you have a specific alien, weapon, resources or other things, that's a VERY appreciated RPG touch. The battle is simple, yet harder to master, you need to choose where the weapons should be shooting, is it wiser to take down their weapons, their shields, or their drones? Your call, and keep some crew to repair the damage. Overall, I'm really happy about this title, the trailer was great, but the game inside is so much more, truly an indie master piece.			"

												This game is brilliant.It looks simple, and it is, very simple, to learn to play. Mastering it, however, will take a lot longer.The game revolves around your ship, fleeing Rebel forces and trying to reach the Allied Fleet. You start off with a few crew, some minor weapons, and few empty spaces on your ship for improvements and new systems. How you develop from there is entirely up to you.You can use your scrap to upgrade your weapons, turning your ship into a powerful gunship. You have the options of buying new, stronger, weapons as the you locate stores, or traders. Or, if you are really lucky, you'll just find a random weapon floating in space.Or, perhaps you'd like to capture enemy ships instead of destroying them. Then you want teleporters, and Mantis crewmen. Mantis are the insectoid race, and they are excellent in combat. Beam them into your enemy's ship, and watch as they tear through the crew until the ship is yours.Of course, these are just two of the ways you can play this. With the Advanced Edition upgrade, you get new systems to play with, which provide you with even more options.On top of all this, there is the hangar. Even if you beat the boss, there are another 9 ship classes to check out, and most of those have three variants, so there is still loads to do.Then you have the various quests and missions to do, 8 randomly generated sectors of space to explore in each game, and even the chance of discovering a lost lost system... If you are lucky. All while on the run from the Rebel Fleet.In short, I highly recommend this game. FTL is loads of fun, and rather addictive. And even if you do get tired of playing (eventually), there are many, many mods out there for it which will change up your gameplay.			"

												People who think games like Dark Souls is hard have probably never played FTL before. This strategy game where you control a space-ship that is running away from the Rebel fleet in an attempt to save the galaxy is honestly one of the most difficult rouge-like's that I've ever played. There were so many times when I'd reach the final boss of the game with max health and soon find my ship completely destroyed in mere moments simply because they'd breach my defenses before I could even graze their ship. This unforgiving game only lets you have one life throughout the whole game, and finding that the game runs on the weirdest random number generator doesn't exactly make things a lot easier on the player. The different weapons and ships make this game a hell of a lot more interesting, as you constantly have to make changes to your every move throughout the entire game. One moment, you may be dominating a supply ship to the point where they try to flee; but they can't because you shot down their engines. The next, the exact same thing is happening to you. With the new Advanced Edition, the entire game pretty much was changed and rebalanced (Flak is the most OP weapon. Get as much as you can). This game deserves a 9/10, for it's only problem being that unlocking new ships is too vague for most people to get, and with it's weird random number generator it makes it nearly impossible to determine if ""this gameplay will get me a new ship to use"".

It's recommended that you buy a replica Starfleet uniform and elevate your chair on some sort of platform before playing. Remember not to simply click the buttons, but to actively shout ""Divert power from the engines to the shield generator! Charge the main lasers!"" Your neighbors will hate you and move away. 8/10			"

												FTL is a game that is probably a pinnacle of certain individual's gaming enjoyment. A sci-fi, tactical, procedurally generated, customizable, spaceship game is something that I imagine quite a few people have been waiting for, even if they didn't realize it. The player takes the role of the crew of a small starship attempting to cover a certain distance of space to reach the Federation homeworld. The catch being that you are being pursued by rebel forces that are seeking to destroy you because you're carrying data that could result in the downfall of those forces. You jump from point to point interacting with rebel forces, pirates, science expeditions, galactic forces, etc., while attempting to maintian your position in front of the ever encroaching rebel force. Hijinks ensue.FTL is incredibly replayable, very challenging, rewarding, very engaging, and fun. For those who enjoy the genre it's a game that they will derive much enjoyment from, and for those who aren't sure of the genre, FTL is a great place to start. Great recommendation.			"

												A rogue-like space mission in which you must deliver the last hope of a dying Federation in a marathon trip through several varied sectors. Your journey is restricted both by your limited fuel and the approaching Rebel fleet, so grinding isn't really an option. Each game should take around a half hour to an hour and a half and there is a nearly endless combination of weapons and modules to experiment with. Everything is controlled by very simple resources and upgrade trees, keeping the learning curve short. All great things which make for a great game. What I couldn't get over, and what drains a good portion of the fun out of this game for me, is just how random a rogue-like. It is nearly impossible to set a goal beyond survival and success. Various weapon combinations might excite you, but there is no guarantee you'll ever get a shot at testing them. The trade off here is, of course, that each playthrough is unique and if that's what you're looking for, FTL is perfect for you. However, if you look to strategy games for intense planning and not the fun a constant wrench in the works makes for, this might not be the game for you.			"

												When strategy meets action, there's a slim chance for success. FTL doesn't know what a no-win situation is, and smashes through the gaming barrier of the two genres with pinpoint accuracy. This game belongs in your library. Here's why:Space. The final frontier. These are the voyages of you in a tiny little vessel struggling to stay ahead of a fleet that is gunning for you with big, nasty battle-cruisers capable of vaporizing your ship and your crew with it....but not if you're clever.FTL puts you in the seat of the captain, granting you the freedom to wage war, (or not) at your discretion. You place people at the con, promote others to chief engineer, or grant them control over the weapon systems. It's up to you, and their lives are riding on your ability to think on your feet. If you've ever seen an episode of Star Trek, you know that things don't ever go the way you plan them to. The same applies here. Should you grant sanctuary to a rogue mantis? Will you risk the lives of your crew to stop a fire spreading on a colony? Dare you grant mercy to the crew of the warships trying to kill you?The choices are real, and the consequences can come back to haunt you on your next jump. So many times have I been stuck staring at the screen, with the grim understanding that I've just backed myself into a corner. However improbable though, your split-second decisions can turn the tide of war in your favor, yielding great riches or rare devices for your ship.The soundtrack is stimulating. With a score by Ben Prunty that not only keeps you pumped, but grants that delightful sense of immersion through ambience, you'll be wanting the OST by the end of your first playthrough. Invest in the soundtrack bundle.The dialogue is believable, and well-crafted. You'll never meet a situation that you're bored by, as you meet not only malicious bounty hunters, but obscure traders who sell black-market goods in the dark corners of the galaxy. With the ability to name and customize your crew, the chance to lose yourself in the cast of your very own sci-fi thriller is quite likely.You'll get attached to ships. You'll invest great time and effort into crafting the perfect frigate or cruiser, stealth bomber or invasion drop-ship as you find new and creative ways to travel the universe. You'll regret losing crew-mates, and you'll feel genuine rage at the overwhelmingly intelligent AI as they access the weaknesses of your vessel and turn your ship into a bucket of holes.Most of all though; you'll never look back and question that this game was money well-spent. FTL is a must-have for any person who wants to get infinite-replay value on the bridge of a starship. Don't take my word for it though...*points ahead*Thrusters on full.			"

												FTL is like one of those books where you get to make choices. You are a starship captain and it is your job to warn the Federation of the impending Rebel threat. You must decide which sectors to explore, while staying ahead of your enemy, and doing all the good things good starship captains do; like going tromping into a seemingly abandoned space station, all because of some faint life signs you can’t identify. Sometimes things will go great, like getting a new crew member or some much needed supplies, while other times ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan and everyone dies. Seeing your failed plans and bad decisions culminating in your voyage ending is soul crushing at first, but it's what makes FTL truly amazing.			"

												Firstly the soundtrack to this game is awesome, fits the feel of the game perfectly. FTL is pretty challenging with the hardest difficulty being normal, but that is hard enough. It takes lots of critical thinking and luck to win this game, due to limited resources and time, and managing all of the ships systems, crew members, and enemies either shooting you, teleporting onto your ship, and/or sending drones to attack.  A few missed attacks and you could go from a clear victory to death against the wrong opponent.  Great indie title that everyone should consider.			"

												Having played FTL through multiple times, and fallen in love with the game over and over, I can officially say you should take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt. With that out of the way, I love this game.StoryThe story of FTL is a simple, yet effective one, providing just enough backstory to set the player into the universe. The galaxy was controlled by the Federation, a coalition between humans and various other races, such as the robotic Engi, and the hyper-intelligent Zoltans, until the Rebellion came. Humans were fed up with being equal with other races, and led a successful rebellion against the Federation, all but destroying it. You are the commander of a small Federation cruiser, holding the only information that can help the Federation win the war. Your task is to fly through the galaxy, racing against the Rebels, to get to the last Federation base, and inform them of the weakness of the Rebel fleet.Gameplay:FTL is played from a top-down perspective, with you, the player, in control of a spaceship, requiring you to manage weapons, shields, engines, etc. to keep the ship alive in the depths of an unforgiving galaxy. When I say unforgiving, I mean unforgiving.  Just about everything is out to get you: Pirates, Rebel Ships, and Giant Alien Spiders make up only a tiny portion of the people who want to tear your ship apart peice by peice. You have to survive the constant onslaught with just your wits, carefully balancing your systems and crew to quickly end conflicts with as little damage as possible. In between events, you jump from point to point on a map of your current sector, which can hold shops, distress signals, and other miscellaneous warp points. As you travel through the galaxy, you'll acquire new crew, weapons, and systems to fight the ever-stronger enemies, in an arms race to the Federation Base, culminating into a final boss fight that will put your ship, and your skills, to the test. This game is not easy by any stretch of the imagination, and even on easy mode you will find yourself dying over and over. If you can get past the difficulty curve of the game, you'll find that it offers a very deep and rewarding experience, which will keep you coming back time and again.Visuals:The visuals in FTL are simplisitic, and two-dimensional, this doesn't mean that they are bad however. The game's art is fantastic, with the various ships, weapons, and aliens all having a unique look that suits their particular traits. The environments in this game are gorgious, with backgrounds of deep space, nebulae, and planets that never seem to get old.Writing:FTL's writing is funny, adding a bit of levity to an overall tense game. Many of the random events are incredibly out in left field, and the writing capitalizes on this, such as in the case of the aforementioned Giant Spiders. That said, the writing isn't all jokes, and also does a fantastic job of building the universe. In many of the encounters you are offered a chance to let enemy ships surrender, with really humanizes each encounter, and provides a moral dillemma with each ship you encounter. Often the rebels really aren't that dedicated to the cause, and are just average joes conscripted to help, and whether you should kill them or not is up to you.Music:One of the best aspects of this game is it's sound design. This game has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game, with beautiful ambient music to accompany the lulls in the action, and tense tracks during tough battles. All the music in FTL is very electronic, most easily described as a mix of Chiptune, Ambient, and Trance. The music is relaxing enough to play a long session without getting boring, and engaging enough to keep you on the edge of your seat during some of the harder fights in the game. The sound effects of the various weapons, crew, and environmental hazards all fit perfectly, and can repeat without ever sound grating or annoying. Overall, the sounds and music in FTL add just as much to the experience as the visuals, if not a bit more.Problems:For all that I've said about the game being fantastic, it does have a bit of a flaw that some people may find irritating. The way you unlock ships straddles the border between a good progress system, and an annoying grind, especially with many of the type B or random event ships. To unlock Type B cruisers, you must complete two of the corresponding ship's achievements, which can be anything from a normal run, to a pain in the ♥♥♥. (I'm looking at you Rock Cruiser.) On top of that, there's a secret ship owned by the crystal race which has two methods of unlocking: Complete a series of random events, dependent upon about fifty thousand different dice rolls going perfectly, or beat the game with every other ship's (excluding the new Lanius cruiser) Type A and Type B configurations.  That said, none of the ships are objectively better than the others, and are really just built to suit different playstyles.Final Thoughts:FTL is a great game that will provide hours of entertainment, for a bargain price of $10, about the same as going to a movie. If you feel that FTL might not be the game for you, I recommend waiting until it goes on sale to try it. For those of you intrigued by the concept of a spaceship simulator, or like strategy games, buy it. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Remember the old text based adventures that were choice based? Probably not.But FTL is kinda like that only that you gain some level of control over your fate. A lot of things are randomly generated so you can't really plan ahead.You are the mastermind of a ship and its crew, you are fighting against time to get across space. In order to survive the many ordeals of spacefaring you need to get money to recruit people, buy fuel, missiles and ship parts. You can also flat out upgrade the ship and the parts you own. But since you can't plan ahead you never know what you need, and neither are the shop offering the same items or are in the same place. So that's a game of dice. In the end you will most likely die on your way to the goal, but you learned some sort of valuable lesson, probably. You will feel frustrated but also ready to get right up in the saddle and try again.			"

Randomly generated sectors, a deep pool of events and a fair, yet strict dificulty ensures that you'll both die often and never run out of new things to see.  Unlocking new ships is almost entirely luck based, but as with many other Rougelikes, that's half the fun.  Pick it up if you can.  Then get blown up.  A lot.			"

												What is there to say about FTL other than it is an amazing game that can provide you hours of limitless fun. The wide range of weaponry allows for a variety of play styles and can keep speedrunners and explorers alike entertained. The real gem is the games combat system which allows for on the fly tactical decision making that can impact the fate of your ship and her crew, all at the slip of misplaced energy bars.The graphics of the game are charming, and allow for those with lower end computers to enjoy the same fun as people with more expensive rigs. While it may be a turn-off for some, the simplified blocky art style showcases the gritty and fearful nature of the game and what lies beyond the great expanse of space Procedural generation makes it so that no 2 adventures are the same, however the same cannot be said about the specific encounters or battles as they will inevitably repeat themselves. This can become annoying over multiple playthroughs, but overall will not detract from the game as a whole.In conclusion, I would reccomend this game to someone who has always wanted to be at the helm of their very own starship, or someone who just needs a casual breakaway from your everyday AAA-cookie cutter title.Rating: 9/10			"

												FTL is pretty much everything you see on an episode of Star Trek.  That's literally what it is; Star Trek: The Game.  Want to divert power from weapons into shields?  By gum, you can.  Want to use your scanners to avoid enemy ships?  A valid strategy!  Do you not take a deal with the Slugs because they tend to rip you off?  Well, depends on how much you need it.Officially, FTL is a rouge-like-like.  Each round is short, usually playable in one sitting, and will vary from every other round immensely.  With fantastic music and brilliant story situations, I would highly recommend this to anyone that sees games above a simple entertainment venue as well as anyone who wanted to be Captain Kirk when they were a kid.  Both categories of people, and many more at that, will be completely satisfied.			"
