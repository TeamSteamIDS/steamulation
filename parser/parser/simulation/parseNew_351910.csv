												It's already out of Early Access and there is little content except the relatively same repetitive level over and over, not worth $30 in any way whatsoever. Maybe grab it on a sale for $10, but that's the most you should be spending on this in it's current state			"

Early Access Review
								Alright, only about 2 hours in on this so take this with a grain of salt.[Positives]  I like it. Why I don't say love is because I am still only at the beginning but can definitely say it's making a great start.  To start the Ai in this game is a lot better then most I see of similar genre. While in other games you must single out each individual unit to give them a task and actually get them working in this game the vikings just get up and do it. Want a new tent built? Great all the units that were standing by the fire get up grab some timber from the woodcutter and get on it. Another great thing about the Ai is that there are specific jobs and they immediately fill those jobs and get to work as soon as the building is up. Now does that make the game easier? No, it just means there is a lot less time consumption on simple tasks. You still have a capacity of vikings to feed, arm, and shelter.  Combat. Alright let's get down to what's trying to kill you. Now in most games like this you'll have enemies that roam around the map and well try to kill you a disrupt your work. As far as I have gotten this isn't the major issue. In this game you have a basically end ""battle"" to each level. You choose when to engage in this battle but you never know what's gonna pop out and take a swing at you. Now don't think it's just the portal, there are still some enemies that I have seen lingering around the map. So it's still safe to say you won't be putting off making some battle ready vikings till the very end of your work. Also a big plus is they took into consideration that maybe your assault fails and the portal is now open. Well, you can construct and altar burn up some resources and you'll calm the attack down. So the final battle doesn't HAVE to be an all or nothing deal. Then again I didn't use it I fight to win! I also believe you can simply use the altar to make peace and have a non-aggressive victory as well.  Resources. Through the game you'll find you'll need to find food and materials. This can be handled by building a Wood Cutters Shack, a Quarry, a Fishery, and a Hunter's Lodge. Now while you can replant trees it is a slow process but you won't run out of wood, the quarry I haven't had any issues with running out of stone, the Fishery will catch fish to feed your people but it isn't the fastest process, and the hunter's lodge while faster then the Fishery it does warn that if you kill too many of the animal they will not be able to repopulate. SO, mind those resources!  Construction. As I said before the game does an amazing job with the Ai and contruction and even getting the people working in on it. Now for the buildings however there is quite a bit of challenge given you are set on more difficult terrain. There are some locations you just can't build on and others that are optimal for building on. This makes choosing your building locations much more difficult especially considering how resources need to flow through your area. Also a big plus by my standards: PATHS don't cost anything. Seriosly I can't stress how annoying it is for paths to cost X amount of resources when it's just a dirt path.  As for the art and style of the game. They hit the nail on the head. It fits perfectly and the scenery is simple and enjoyable. A nice cartoon-ish setting fits the casual play of the game and doesn't overwhelm you. Also a fun bit in the background that you'll love is each time you open a portal a volcano on another island explodes. I mean who doesn't love exploding volcanoes... that you're not directly beside.[Negatives]  Alright no game is perfect but, some mistakes can be forgiven.  Now you have to manage feeding your vikings and taking care of their needs. The problem I found was I have no way of knowing what they are complaining about until I see some in game identifiers. Like when you don't have enough homes for them. You'll start seeing them sleeping under trees. Also when there isn't enough food you'll just see a speech bubble pop up over their heads with a hunch of meat in it. Now while this isn't a major issue and does actually make you pay attention to your npcs I can see it being a problem when the towns become much larger and making sure everyone is taken care of becomes a much bigger task.  Another issue I had was the camera angle. While I did manage it and got by quite easily with the problem I had it would still be nice if I had more freedom with the camera to better position paths and building construction.  Also, been told this was a bug, but a some of my vikings were tring to make bows which requires sticks. They kept breaking the sticks for something along the lines of 5 in game days. I honeslty thought they were just failing a crafting recipe.  This may be a personal problem but later in the game you will run into a neutral mob called a boar. Now these things are big and at first glance quite intimidating. This deterred me from building near them and I even made some early game fighter vikings to try and fight them. Turns out that boars are just the second thing a hunter will hunt for after all the bunnies are gone. Blame that one on just being new.[Personal Notes]I will be continue to play this game. The maps are beautiful, the game is casual, and most importantly fun. You don't need the major strategy of an elite pro gamer to make it through levels but you still have to think it out and make plans. That's the right kind of difficulty for a game you can sit down to after a day of work and enjoy. Worth a good looking into and if you need a fun casual thinking game I highly recommend this.			"

												Valhalla Hills will remind many older gamers of titles like The Settlers and Culture, which is the normal given that the development team that creates the new Viking driven experience had a hand in the creation of both those already classic titles.The entire game is built around optimization, with gamers asked to carefully control the movement of their characters and the location of their buildings to create communities that can thrive and exploit the environment around them. Valhalla Hills manages to walk a fine line between excessive complexity, which is always a temptation for the city-building genre, and a lack of variety and is suited both for long-term fans of the main mechanics and for those who discover them for the first time.The narrative here is a pretty simple one, albeit quite funny and suitable for the temperamental gods of Norse mythology that inspired it: Odin’s in a pissy mood after his son Leko fails an “exam of the gods,” so he slams the door to Valhalla shut. Unable to rest their weary bones inside, the honorable Vikings are forced to turn to Leko — demoted to the unflattering position of “God of the Builders” — who will attempt to redeem himself by leading the heroes up the eponymous mountains. You can do this one of two ways: by opening the magic portals of Valhalla to fight the enemies within, or by appeasing the gods with tributes. And by building: doing tons and tons of building.From the bright, cartoon landscapes to the roly poly design of the little villagers, Valhalla Hills doesn’t take itself too seriously, which is not to say the game is simplistic, shallow, or easy. In fact, there are a number of interconnected systems to monitor and master. Each level begins with a procedurally generated landmass and the player’s task is to build a thriving community that will eventually — either economically or militarily — unlock the magical portal and the bridge to Valhalla.Like The Settlers, the player does not directly control the little Viking villagers, instead controlling where buildings are sited, the types of buildings, and the optimal paths between resources and structures. The population is autonomous and while the player may lay down a series of building sites, the workers will determine the build order. A good strategy is one that does not give the easily distracted villagers too many options.While each level invariably requires an early build sequence that includes finding a source of raw materials and food, then crafting a workshop and tools, once the basics are established the choice becomes how to deal with the monsters or hostile warriors that spawn through or guard the portal to Valhalla. The military option requires building barracks and forging and upgrading weapons, which of course require advanced workshops and rarer materials. Less bellicose players may choose to build a series of temples to control and placate the enemy, but that path also requires an escalating series of constructions and upgrades. Both strategies are viable options and on the middle and later maps, both require a vibrant, well-managed economy.Valhalla Hills has two basic modes: a “campaign” mode in which structures, upgrades, and game systems are introduced slowly, over a number of progressively larger maps; and an “open” mode in which all options are available from the start — as well as all monsters and other enemies. There isn’t much of a story beyond the opening cinematic that explains the premise, and while tooltips pop up every time a new structure or mechanic is introduced, neither is there a tutorial proper. Experienced players of The Settlers or other city builders can probably intuit a lot what they need to know, but it will take all players some trial and error and less than optimal results before the systems become clear.Once you do get into the flow of this game however, you will truly be able to appreciate what it has going for it. The graphical quality, while simple, is smooth and refined, striking an unexpected balance between old-school sensibilities and modern-day sharpness. The maps are fully articulated, allowing you to move and zoom freely about their entirely and providing a hexagonal grid only when it’s appropriate, allowing a more consistent sense of immersion.The music of Valhalla Hills is… alright. It’s soothing, adequately produced and thematically appropriate, but not memorable. Considering this title is mostly about magicing buildings into existence, large orchestral scores would’ve been strange, granted, but something a little more unique and stylish would have been nice during those times when I was hurrying up to wait.On the point of action, there isn’t a great deal of it. Most of the fighting you will encounter is when your brave followers decide to press onward to through the next portal toward Odin’s side. At these times, and depending on how you play it, guardians may appear to challenge your vikings to prove their worth. These battles are mostly a test of your preparedness and foersight, not of your tactics or formation of units. Niko is a builder, not a fighter, and it’s at these moments that it shows the most.This is honestly a very well built game and a pleasure to play. It’s not really all that complex or burdened with layers of technicalities of its own design. It feels inviting and wants you to have a good time poking around with your options in search discovering new features to add to your fun. But the lack of a strong tutorial system slides it to a farther end of the learning than I think the developers intended. You sort of need to have a strong grasp of RTS games like this one in order to feel confident any time soon, and that’s not the kind of thing a newcomer may want to put themselves through.Other should-be-important details, such as how to accrue Honor, a type of passive meta-stat required by Odin for your vikings to be accepted into his kingdom, goes largely unexplained even after it becomes necessary. I cleared the first few maps being told how impressive my Honor score was with no idea what that meant, how to check it, or how I could do it again.Valhalla Hills is all in all, a strong little RTS, with enough going on under the surface to satisfy most fans of the genre. Its style is fitting enough and the game endears itself to you and keeps you immersed. Valhalla Hills is a solid game that anyone who has ever played The Settlers will enjoy.			"

												I had high hopes for this game (being a Settlers/Cultures fan) and played it a lot. I really liked the idea of the game and have a lot of respect for the team behind it. I wish I could recommend it, but I just can't. There are non-trivial unfixed bugs (just look at the forum) and this game does not get updates anymore. Heck, I reported a bug 10 weeks ago and did not even get a response from the developers.edit (2017-03-11): Nine months have passed since I reported the bug I referred to above.  Nothing has happened since then.  Neither a dev nor someone working for the publisher posted anything in the VH Steam forum (which is the official forum for the game) since then.  This game is definitely dead.Anyway, right now one can apparently get the game (without the DLCs) for $1 in a HumbleBundle.  Considering that price there's a good chance that you won't regret buying this game; especially if you liked the Settler and Cultures games of the past.			"

												This game is a dissapointment, being a fan of the Cultures series I have to admit that the dumbed down mechanics are just horrible. Vikings just fall out of from the sky, and the game has been so streamlined that all you have to do is just mass-manufacture axes and head for the gate. It feels like a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥product and moreover the devs are trying to get money for DLCs only add biomes to the randomly generated maps which are by themselves lackluster.Despite buying this game on release, and rooting for it. I cannot recommend purchasing the game in its state. It feels incomplete and has no storyline. You just repeat the same thing over and over again, which is try to get to the gate and accumulate karma points...			"

								What YOU will do in this game (in its current early access state): (1) Place buildings, choosing carefully which building, when, and where (2) Click on a portal to advance to another levelWhat the AI does for you: (1) All research (2) enemy fights (3) production of food and resources - and basically everything else normally enjoyed by many gamers in the market for a title like this. An abnormally passive, albeit charming, experience.Hopefully the devs will note what some other reviewers have called out (lack of gameplay variety) and add that into the roadmap. It IS a charming, well produced game, but beauty alone is not everything sadly. :)  "

								It's a settlers game and so far so good. I like the theme with the vikings being banished and trying to prove them selves by building and going to Valhalla.You construct and and survive going from one island to another through the use of portals, but to use the portals you'd have to either fight the guardians or appease them by giving them an offering.

			Views: 2,199		

			Don't know if it's actually alpha or beta, the developers don't communicate so we just wen't with alpha since it's months til release. A good settlers game though.		

It's easy to pick up and understand what it requires you to do. The UI and controls are easy and intuative, and the overall quality is nice. Plus it looks beautiful once you have a lot of constructions build, especially at night.The one complaint I have so far is that I can move my camera more upwards, so no being able to look from a more of a top-down view is really bugging me. There's also a good amount of optimization that needs to be done which I presume will happen over the course of the early access stage.Overall it's a nice game with nice progression that I'm happy I bought. Just needs a few tweaks to make it more enjoyable, like that damn camera control.			"

												I reluctantly decided ""Not recommended"". The graphics are good, it doesn't crash, it seems well made in most respects. But it has some serious balance issues which make it very frustrating, and in a way you can't solve with your own skill.If food gets low, your society will fall into a spiral where the people making food are too hungry to work but won't eat the little food that comes up. Civilian vikings will walk halfway across the map to sleep under a tree (instead of the closer trees), then aggro a bear and decide to stand there and punch it until they die. You're constantly fighting the terrain, trying to build a mine that can reach ore (and after it takes 20 minutes to build you realize its range is only 2 octagons and it nope, no ore).  Every game has these sorts of issues, but this game has ALL of them. Instead of a smoothly flowing strategy game you get a series of ridiculous stumbling block events that you have no controls to break out of.			"

Early Access Review
								If i could compare this game to another game... It would have to be the older Settlers games. Except instead of controling romans. You control Vikings, Already, thats a much cooler type of people to play with . Do keep in mind that it is still beta. So some glitches, and other unfinished things are needed. But besides that, the game is uber fun. each viking requires sleep and food, and thats the only needs they desire. and technicly they can provide both of those by themselves by sleeping under a tree, or picking berries from a bush.The story goes that Odin is angry at the Vikings for some reason, so when vikings die, they don't ""really"" die, they go in some sort of purgatory viking world, where if you die, you just get swooshed to a island, and you must fight for your honor. How does a viking get into valhalla? Easy, so building and killing grants honor points, and each viking how there own seperate bar of honor. when they reach 10000 honor points, they ascend into valhalla.  Heres the pretty good part, when a single viking performs a task that would grant honor points, all other active vikings also get the honor points. So its really a group effort situation.In resume. beautiful graphics,  AI i would say is 80% smart, you get to build beautiful viking villages, and the game technicly has unlimited gameplay, since every time you beat a map, a randomly generated map will be created for your next level, and they do indeed get harder and harder.so far so good8/10eNjoy ^-^			"

Banished to the mortal world by Odin, you play as Leko, the god of building as you reclaim your right and honor as a God by guiding cute, little vikings on their quest to ascend to Valhalla! Game OverviewValhalla Hills' story starts of with Odin banishing his son into the world of mortals due to his ""uncharacteristic interest"" in building things instead of showing his worth through battle.You will play as ""Leko"", the god of building, and lead the forsaken viking heroes on a quest to return to Valhalla. However, that task is easier said than done.Many obstacles like underworld guards will come to block your path, in which you can approach by two different ways: either battle it out with them or by appeasing them with your sacrifices (in which these are the common goals that is required for you to clear a stage). The most important part before anything else is that you must teach and guide your people on how to survive and live through the lands and accumulate honor to prove your worth to Odin in order to ascend back to Valhalla.The Pros Fun and Satisfying Gameplay - Though the game requires time to play through, the end result of your actions is quite satisfying as you see your little town of vikings run smoothly, which is further complimented by the beautiful graphics of the game. Charming Art Design - A perfect cartoonic design that presents a charming appeal regardless of audience age is showcased throughout the game. It is also quite a view to see when the game transitions from day to night. Good Audio - The game presents an atmospheric audio that suits the theme of a city-building simulation that is played and executed in a serene and melodic fashion. The kind of soundtrack that is pleasant to the ears even if you are hearing it for long periods of time. The Cons Insufficient Story Depth - Aside from the introductory setting, there isn't really anything that follows up to make it more immersive story-wise, and having only two goals of either battling the guards or appease them through sacrifices to clear a stage doesn't really help in that sense. Weak Tutorial - For someone that is essentially a beginner with city-building simulation games, it took me quite a bit of time to figure out how to play out the game efficiently, which is the result of me skipping out on the tutorial itself (though it is present at any stage of the game) since the large amount of text didn't seem too interesting and I assumed that you can figure the game without holding on the ropes. However, for those seasoned people out there, this may not be a problem for you.  The VerdictFor those who like city building simulation games and would like to try out a more fantasy take on that kind of genre, this game is perfect for you!Furthermore, the game developers are quite active in terms of updates which could lead on this game being better and more accessible for other gamers.If you like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other reviews, or follow our curator group at Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.

								The concept of this game is really interesting. The lifetime of each map is something around 20 minutes (It's longer the longer you play, because there are more challenges on your way to the portal). The flow of the game is something like this: You start a game => it generates random map (with random size defined by unlocks) => you build your village => prepare army/satisfy gods => enter a portal => you unlocked new things => start over (or you can alternatively continue to build your village, but trust me, you most probably don't want that). I could feel, that this is still a very early version of the game, but nonetheless it's fun for some time.			"

												As much as I wanted to like and recommend this game, I just can't. There's no real challenge here, and while I appreciate the nods to the Settlers series (placing buildings with specific functions, no direct control over my Vikings, careful micro-management of supply chains), there's not much else to do.Here's how a typical level goes:Place buildings to get production goingMicro-manage the production of materials, food, weapons when the supply chain breaks downProduce soldiers when food production is sufficientPlace army camp close to a ""portal"" to release hostile creaturesDefeat hostile creatures in a fight that literally takes less than 10 secondsProceed to next levelInitially, I enjoyed the Settlers-like vibe to the production/supply chain management, and I liked seeing my Vikings carrying goods between locations and using the road system I'd built them, but it got old very quickly. I have no idea *why* I am doing any of this, who my enemies are or what benefits I get from defeating them. It's just rinse, repeat ad nauseum. The only gameplay variances come from the unlocks, which open new buildings, terrains and technologies for use, but none of these have proven to be game-changers yet.After 10+ hours, I'm left feeling like this is an unfinished game, and that I should rather go dig up my copy of The Settlers IV instead.

 Intro - About  	This amazing mythological strategy game is a great game to relax to but always have that never ending rush of excitement that will never seize to wow you. A good mix of fantasy and building makes you interested throughout the game. You start out as a few Vikings on an island and must give them the resources they need to survive the wilderness and deadly foes. Build huts to allow them to get rest, build  woodcutters to supply wood, quarry's for stone, fishery and hunter for food, military for recruiting to fight off the enemies that come from the portal. Once you defeat them you gain more things to build. Pros & Cons ++  Pros + Great graphics+ Charming atmosphere + Enjoyable and rewarding experience+ Plenty of options to play the way you want or to speed up process.-- Cons - Not enough tutorials- Ai are almost always just running around or doing nothing- Repedative play  Summary  	This is a great game, and is very much like a mobile game. Almost relatable to Sims or clash of clans. None the less the works great for PC and runs well and responds to everything and optomizable options and graphics to maximize performance of your game-play.	Replay-ability is strong, with you every growing and evolving population of Vikings. You learn to build different building and give more of your people to have places to work to get an efficient flow of any resource you need to keep them living and to fight. Personal Opinion 	This was a toughy at first because I had no idea what I was doing and the tutorials did not guide me enough to fully grasp the way the game was meant to be played. After a little while of playing, I slowly learned what I was supposed to do and was quickly up on my feet and had all my Vikings up an working. The graphics are very charming and makes for a smooth game-play and less stress on the eyes for those of you that binge play. 	The fact that you can speed up build process and harvesting was wonderful, and the pause button allows you to get up out of your seat without having to worry about random attacks on your unarmed Vikings, and take a look around your village to check and see if everything is going as you expected. Final recommendation: 	I was *iffy* at first but the true game-play kept me playing long enough to understand what I needed to do. I soon fell in love with the ease of play but great excitement of the battles. I Recommend this extremely charming fantasy strategy game and I will be playing this very often! I rate this game    ----     7.5/10 If you found this review helpful and want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow here! "

												I dont understand all the bad reviews. This is not a 4x. it is not CIV 17.5. It is not a milsim, its just a mellow relaxing little twist on settlers. Especially settlers 1 & 2. I'm pretty sure you will like this if you liked the early settlers. (in my opinion, settlers started going downhill after 4). I was hesitating to buy this, as i really like the genre, but it had so many negative reviews. I watched i video by petard (who loved it) and i decided to get it.PRO:* the scenery is pretty and the models are cute* you have a little more control over your troops than early settlers, but still not a lot. This is not a game for heavy military strategy. thats one of the mistakes that the settlers series ended up making* the terrain varies from map to map providing diffferent challenges* roads are way easier to manage than in settlers 1* resource movement (which stumps a lot of people it seems) is important, it doesnt ""just happen""  (see below)CON:* music is nice, but a few more tracks would be better* you do tend to start most games placing the same buildings in the same orderRESOURCE MOVENT:(I want to call this out seperately since this is a common complaint of even some positve reviewers. I think it is a PRO but could legitimatly be seen as a CON by some people.)As your village gets more spread out, resources will not be distributed the way you want without doing extra work. Each building has a limited range of influence, if you have a remote fishing hut, the fish will not get transported to your central stockpile. your villagers will only make the trek out to the hut when the are starving.Since the fisherman stops fishing when his hut is full (5 fish) this could mean that people may not have enough to eat. (hunger really slows your vikings down). There are a number of strategies to deal with this in the game. Additional stockpile workers, additional stockpiles and couriers a the three most obvious. This makes VH a game where you really have to think about storage an transport. Which i like  - this makes it more than just a settlers cloneSUMMARY:if you want a military strategy or a deep 4X, look somewhere else.  If you want a relaxing town builder with cute vikings with resource management and a little fighting then you should probably get this "

Early Access Review
								I used to love playing the Settlers series of games, but that kind of ended with #2 before it got a bit too military focused, and somehow lost some of the charm. So far, I've really enjoyed Valhalla Hills - it has that charm, and more. It is still early-access so I'm not sure if/how my few cons will be addressed, but here they are:- the game starts to get a bit choppy once your island gets more populated and you have a few buildings going, but then again I'm playing on a laptop, so this may not be a huge deal- seems to be no way to control what goes into a stockpile, which isn't a huge drawback. Each stockpile can hold multiple stacks (of up to 5-10 items, so far), but they only have a number of stacks they can hold. The basic stockpile will gladly hold 6 stacks of 5 logs, which is inconvenient if you wanted to have it store food or somethingSo far, those are my only two issues with the game!Pros:- the pacing is good. The quests slowly introduce you to each building, but it never feels like a chore, more of a guided sandbox play, which I enjoy.- the military aspect isn't difficult so far. There's a few dudes to beat when you want to unlock the gate to finish each level (if you choose to go military route - can bypass by sacrificing goods at the altar). Some missions have baddies roaming around, but they're fairly easy to deal with and so far they do not respawn.- the animation is good, and I enjoy watching my little dudes march around, like the old settlers games.- there is an interesting variety of buildings so far, and I am still unlocking more, which gives good incentive to keep playing- the graphics are really nice, even on lower settings!Overall if you like a chill-out-and-build kind of game, this is it. Lots of fun and I am looking forward to playing more.			"

TLDR:A pretty solid and gorgeous town management game inspired by norse mythology that, unfortunately, in terms of story leaves something to be desired.Valhalla Hills is a real time town management game in which you play as Leko, son of Odin, who instead of being a distinguished and devoted warrior as his ancestors, prefers to spend his time building houses. Because of this Odin banishes you to live among the mortals on Earth until you regain your honour.The game offers you two different modes to play, Classic and Open. Open mode offers a more challenging experience in which you have every building unlocked. On the other hand, Classic mode gradually increases in difficulty and unlocks more things as you play, and it is thus recommended to new players.On Classic mode, the story starts nice and interesting but it quickly falls short and lacks any depth by only having a nicely put introductory cutscene. I still haven’t beaten the game but, from what I’ve played, there is no connection between each mission in terms of story, which I find to be rather disapointing.Gameplay:The game plays very simple, different colors when placing buildings, and other elements of the UI make the game somewhat intuitive and easy to understand how everything works out. Still, it has been a while since I’ve played one of these management games, and so, I must say that the tutorial and instructions that this game gives you do not really teach you some essential things, other than what some buildings do, and because of that it took me a while to learn how resource and tool distributing systems worked out. At its core, it plays like most town management games out there, especially ones like the Settlers series. You start with a small number of vikings, which you have no direct control of,  and a handfull of resources and from there you need to figure out the best way to prosper and expand your little settlement. Usually this means building basic resources buildings such as woodcutters, toolmakers and hunters or fishermen right off the bat and, afterwards, making sure you have a steady supply of resources coming from these places in order to feed the needs of your settlers.On each mission the objective is always the same, you have to open a portal to Valhalla. First, you need to get a unit close to the portal in order to activate it and, after that, you need to deal with the guardians that come out of these portals. This can be done in two ways, by simply killing them with your soldiers or by performing sacrifices.Pros:Gorgeous looking visualsNice and cheerful soundtrackRewarding gameplayCons:Barebones storySomewhat lacking tutorialsRepetitive levels and gameplayOverall thoughts:Valhalla Hills is overall a very good and pleasing title, it looks, sounds and plays great but sometimes I just wish it had something more going for it. Some of its mechanics are not well explained on the tutorial sections but after thinking for a little bit, you should start to realize how certain systems work. Eventually, you might also come across certain situations in which your vikings are wandering randomly with no idea what to do or take some time to perform a certain task, this can get somewhat infuriating but the fact that you can speed up time helps a lot. And last but by no means least, I really wish each mission was more varied other than just a bigger island to fight for and expand through and that the story was told by little bits spread across each mission, or establishing a link between them.VerdictIf you’re a huge fan of the genre and you’re looking for another city management game with a wonderful and charming setting I’d say you check this one out. Despite its lack of story depth and somewhat repetitive levels, at its core Valhalla Hills stands strong on its own. Eitherways, I suggest waiting for a sale because I think that the current price is somewhat high for what it initially offers.			"

												Bought this some time ago, given how I love settlement building games and I was hoping this would be on the line with Settlers and Anno games for this price. I went through first 10 levels or so and every level is the same, they just get bigger. Lot of the buildings are pointless, there's no need for any kind of economy and all you have to do is build one camp of soldiers, take it to the portal and clear the guardians. And that's it. All there is to this game. Luckily my refund was accepted.			"

Early Access Review
								This game brought some humorous factors, for example every viking has a name and sort of different personality. You would see one of them wanna take his own little advanture, while the others stick to their own path! And the music, is great! You are managing your workers, but not manipulating them. So it's kinda tricky sometimes to guide them to do what you want. Then you fail and you start to realize how to better manage your whole supply chain next time.I was really confused in the first few maps which they supposed to teach you the game. It doesn't really explain very well the mechanic. But don't worry the situation won't turn into a hot mess. Very soon you will start to taste the real fun of the game. All in all, it's a very enjoyable game and worth the money. 8/10			"

												I am currently finding this game very enjoyable. It still has a few bugs to squash (then again what game doesn't) but Funatics seem activly involved on the forums so that is a very good and welcome sign.The game play is simple enough not to put you off, yet complex enough to keep you interested. None of the levels have been overly complicated so far, however I am not that far in and it is getting progressivly more difficult.The ""Normal"" mode trains you how to play the game, progressivly unlocking items as you go along so as not to overwhelm you. There is a sandbox type mode that has everything already unlocked but if you don't have a good grip on the game yet this mode should be avoided to start, unless you like pain, confusion, and rage quiting.Graphics wise the game does enough to look good (built on UE4) but doesn't have any un-needed fluff or eye-candy, which can be seen as a good or bad thing.Overall I'm excited to see what this game still has in store and what updates are just around the corner.If you like settlers, ANNO, Tropico, Cultures, and games of that nature this is right up your alley. If not there isn't much in this one that will entice you to keep playing.			"

								In its current state (maybe always as an intention) it lacks enough player involvement. Simply place the buildings down in what appears to be the best positions, usually in a certain order, add some paths, then just sit and watch (or do some real life stuff) until you feel ready to open the portal. A fun game should need almost constant interaction, or at least give the player something useful to do on a regular basis - this game is far too automated to the point it plays itself more than the player does.If you like to watch games then buy it.If you prefer to actually play the games yourself then I can't recommend this in its present form.

												Please be aware - I've only played 6 hours of this so far, so take it as you will.I so wanted to like this game. I played the Original Settlers back on the Amiga and it was my favourite game EVAR. I played all the later Settlers games and loved them all too. So when I saw this, I was over the moon.However, I have not been at all grabbed by this game. There seems to be no point to it at all. No ""hurrah, I beat the level"". No particular difficulties to overcome or objectives to achieve. The only thing you seem to do is repeatedly fight your way through portals, with the nebulous overall goal of eventually (through building, fighting etc) getting each of your little dudes up to 100,000 honour points so that they can individually get into Valhalla.I know we've seen ""Set up a town, go through a portal"" before - but there were always challenges in they way of that. Here there seems to be no challenge, and it all just seems terribly...pointless.I am wrestling with the decision of whether or not to refund this game, and I have NEVER refunded a game before, that is the measure of how disappointed I am.For those that are interested - the graphics are ok, but sadly the music is dull and not in the slightest bit catchy. I still get the music from the original Settlers stuck in my head, complete with the sounds effects 20 years later. All I remember about the music from this is that I remember thinking ""this is dull"".			"

												I've made a full video review of Valhalla hills here - 


YouTube™ Video: Valhalla Hills Review - Gameplay and Game Mechanics 

			Views: 996		

			A review of the recently released game - Valhalla Hills. I'll be showcasing the gameplay, along with a breakdown of the games mechanics and production chains - from the simplest to the most complex.		

For those of you that prefer a written review, here it goes:Valhalla Hills is a game very similar to the Cultures franchise and early Settlers games. In fact Valhalla Hills has been developed by Funatics Software - the same company that made these games, so it's to be expected. They've taken a well-loved pair of franchises and changed things up a little, in parts for the better - in parts for worse.Normally games of this genre involve building up an army and destroying the opposition, In Valhalla Hills there is no specific enemy you must defeat to win the level, there is however a wide variety of enemies that are standing in the way between your settlement and your objective. To win the level in Valhalla Hills you need to enter the portal that lies at the top of the mountain and it's usually guarded pretty heavily - there’s also the option to win economically with a sacrifice (basically a bribe to the guards). The aim of the game is to get your Vikings enough honour to enter Valhalla, which in a way makes some aspects of the game feel like a grind. Once a level is complete it's on to the next level to grind more honour! But I’m getting ahead of myself, let’s examine some game mechanics. Production chains are pretty good actually, I'm happy with them. For the production chain of generating resources for buildings, we start with the basics - logs and quarry stone. These are good starting point for building your settlement and will be sufficient for a while. As you progress you'll need to refine these materials with another set of buildings, turning logs into planks and quarry stone into stone bricks. This is as far as the construction materials production chain goes, every structure in the game can be built with either; logs, quarry stone, planks or stone bricks. Like i said I’m happy with that, it's one step beyond what Settlers 3&4 offer but not a rabbit hole of complexity like in Cultures - a nice healthy middle ground. However this is the simplest production chain there is, it just gets more complex after that... mostly in a good way. There's a few irregularities I’ve noticed in the current build (v1.02.01) such as the kitchen, which takes the separate food items your Vikings have produced and combines them into a single unit of food (bread and meat become sandwiches) - this makes life easier for your hungry Vikings, but the nutritional value of the sandwiches is less than the sum of its parts - its wastefulness is a bit irritating!The games AI seems to be a bit silly sometimes, they will stray too far and get attacked, after a bit of fighting back and losing health, they run off, then it seems like the AI resets and they head back to their exact previous location! The cycle of fighting, running and returning usually continues until they die. This issue is exacerbated by the inability to directly control your Vikings, they're off on their own and can't be commanded, Perhaps this is a feature, forcing you to quickly produce some troops and clear the local area - it's an RTS after all.Speaking of the inability to control your Vikings, I get the feeling that Valhalla Hills is trapped in an identity crisis between the highly personal attachment to the Vikings that Cultures offers and the sense of distance from your people that Settlers has, where people are pretty much numbers and nothing more. It's a strange aspect to the game - You can follow your Vikings and rename them, but you can't directly control them and for the most part you have little influence on their daily activities. Finally, if we think back to fighting up to the portal and the other main objective of the game - grinding enough honour to be worthy of Valhalla. I get a sense of ""what’s the point?"" there's currently no campaigns (once again, reviewing build v1.02.01) and no multiplayer. The only justification you have for your actions is the 2 minute long intro animation that plays when you load the game. There's also a feeling of ""Where’s the sense of accomplishment?"" once you make it to the portal, A little bit of music plays and **VICTORY!** appears on the screen, accompanied below by a [Next level] button, then it’s on to the next level to do it all again. There's currently a real lack of a feeling of accomplishment, it would be nice to see a statistics page like Setters 3 and 4 have. Show me the number battles I’ve won, show me the number of buildings I’ve built, rain some Godly Nordic lightening fireworks from the sky, something - anything! I'm really on the fence as to recommend this game or not, it's definitely got a lot of potential. A thumbs up as of right now? Perhaps not. Please bare in mind that I’m biased because I love this kind of game, I’m a big fan of Cultures and I've been playing Settlers 3/4 on a weekly basis on my YouTube channel for over a year now. If you love the RTS genre, or you're a big fan of the Cultures and Settlers franchises and you're looking for a modern revamp then YES, give this game a try, I think you'll really enjoy it. If you're unsure, or you’re new to these kinds of games, then NO - perhaps save your money and either wait for a sale or first try one of the other similar titles available, I'd recommend you take a look at Cultures 2, Settlers 2 (10th anniversary addition), Settlers 3 and Settlers 4. Hope you found this review helpful! Cya all at Odin’s dinner table!			"

												You know, people always make out the Vikings and Norse mythology in general to be a complex web of intricately-woven tales of honor, bravery, and combat. I mean, with some badasses like Odin, Thor, and Loki included in the mythology, it's pretty difficult to not be interested in their crazy tales. But.....what about the mythological figures no one talks about? Like Leko, the supposed son of Odin and the god of building? Does that not ring a bell? Well, I don't blame you, I'm pretty sure he's fictional, and he's coincidentally also the protagonist of this game.The BreakdownValhalla Hills begins with a brief cutscene describing the story of the game. Leko, that guy I mentioned earlier, has been banished from Valhalla by his own father, Odin, because he wasn't into fighting people or something. Poor bloke! Anyway, he now sets off to regain his father's favor by being honorable through whatever means possible. And by that, I mean building stuff and fighting stuff using his little Viking minions people.See, Valhalla Hills is a randomly-generated strategy game primarily focused on building with a side emphasis on combat. It's up to you, Leko, to open and enter the portal on each map through whatever means you choose. This may mean fighting the portal guardians using your Vikings or offering them various resources. Personally, I primarily like to offer resources because fighting can be pretty challenging. Regardless, just managing a town itself can be quite the struggle. You start with only a few Vikings, but by building a complex web of inter-connected buildings the process of maintaining a bunch of happy and healthy Vikings can be quite the struggle.This is mainly because of the nature of the game. Valhalla Hills is not a story-based or progression-based RTS like what  you may be used to. Instead, the only story is given in one short cutscene, and the rest of the game plays out in randomly-generated maps with an arcade sort of feel to them. Each map could take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour to complete, as it just depends on if you want to rush to enter the portal or not. However, depending on how you complete this task can alter how you play. If you want to fight your way to the portal, that can prove to be quite the ordeal because you would need to first build tools, harvest resources, make homes, make even more buildings, find a way to feed all of your Vikings, and finally make some soldiers to fight the portal guardians.However, this is one area where I feel like the game is a little weak. It can be very, very difficult to properly balance soldiers with food production. See, soldiers eat a bunch of food even while just sitting around, which is frustrating because it requires a constant and large supply of food to them. Yet, they can't leave their military camp for some reason, so they need to have food near them. Yet, since you can't order Vikings around or move the soldiers' camp, you need to either only use them defensively or build your town far out near the portal. I know this sounds odd, and to me it really is. It basically makes the option of fighting the portal guardians basically implausible because it'd take ages to be able to build a town large enough to both place soldiers in a path all the way to the portal (which is typically far away from your starting area) and simultaneously feed them all. Sure, after a while you can unlock couriers to transport food near soldiers, but it's still a hassle, and it's frustrating trying to do a military-based run, which takes some of the fun out of that aspect of the game.However, despite that, attempting peaceful runs is still quite fun. It's both challenging and enjoyable to try and balance the needs of non-military Vikings while keeping them busy. When you get a successful, bustling town running finally, it's a joy to just sit and watch all your Vikings go about their daily schedules. In that sense, the game can be really rewarding. Yet, there's even more rewards given to successful playstyles in the form of unlockables. And wow, this game has a ton! Only after a few hours of playing, I've unlocked a bunch of hats, buildings, environment types, and even new enemies. It definitely helps increase the replayability of the game, which is important for arcade-style games like this that caters to people who don't want to play for hours upon hours (though that is certainly an option). Though, if you do decide to keep at it and play for a while, eventually some of your Vikings will reach Valhalla itself. This is because every Viking gains honor as you play, and when they reach 100,000 they'll ascend to Valhalla. I don't think it does much, but it's still a nice addition.And y'know, there's a lot of little intricate details that the game includes that are quite nice just to have. Each building explains what it does and there's a mini-tutorial given at the start for most of them. In addition to that, the depth of the seemingly simple economy is quite impressive. What seems like a simple progression of getting resources --> feeding vikings --> fighting stuff/collecting portal offerings is much more complicated than that. For example, if you only have 1 fisherman but have 50 Vikings, they'll eventually go hungry, causing them to work less and less until they stop working entirely, at which point you may become doomed to failure. Or, if you chop down too many trees but don't have someone who plants new ones, you'll struggle to get more wood which can collapse a large part of the town's economy. Likewise, if you hunt too many animals and don't have an animal breeder to balance the food supply, your townsfolk may starve eventually. Sure, these are all small details, but they add up to make a fun, challenging, and engaging experience.The game may be a little complicated gameplay-wise, but it certainly isn't graphically. Everything has a simple, cartoony look to it that I think actually works quite well. The Vikings look cute (and you can give them hats!), the environments look simple but lovely, and the animations and lighting all flow in a nice, cohesive manner. In fact, I think that's the key to this game's graphical beauty: everything just flows nicely. Unreal Engine 4's lighting capabilities probably helps with that too. Yet, despite the game's aesthetic beauty, it still runs quite nicely, at least from my experience. My computer is a little old, but the game still ran very smoothly with no issues whatsoever. Sound-wise, it's what you might expect: some nice, pleasant tunes and standard sound effects for stuff like building placement. Nothing really stood out to me there.ProsFun, challenging, and rewarding arcade-style RTS gameplay focused on city building on a randomly-generated map (though combat is an option)Loads of replayability in the form of dozens of unlockable buildings, environment types, enemies, and hatsBeautiful graphical cohesion - a big, successful town simply looks gorgeous. Thanks Unreal Engine 4! (oh, and it runs nice too)Steam achievements, trading cards, and cloud save supportConsStory is largely non-existent besides a short initial cutsceneThe gameplay can become somewhat repetitive after long play sessions, so it's best played in short burstsMilitary-focused playstyles will suffer from a massive drain on food supplies, so be warned if you're interested in that aspect of the gameValhalla Hills can be a highly challenging experience, especially for those who are interested in focusing on combat. Yet, it's still certainly very satisfying to play, from witnessing the gradual progression of a tiny settlement to a bustling, sprawling city of Vikings. If you're interested in arcade-style RTS gameplay that's both fun and rewarding with beautiful graphics as well, this game is definitely worth checking out.Final Verdict: 8/10 "

												i really like this game.  It's definately a good Settlers 2 type game with beautiful graphics.  It runs extremely smooth and is worth the money you pay.  There's loads of good points but no one wants to see fluff in reviews so ill just list minor issuesminor annoyances :  - when attacking you just end up building roads everywhere to help your military get to where they want to go (maybe consider removing terrain walk speed slowness for hunters and military units as it just get's messy and it's a little annoying) - Mouse scroll zoom zooms to where the mouse is instead of the center of the screen (I find this annoying, but im just nit picking this one) - all maps encourage you to just bum-rush the stage instead of enjoying a nice long building experience.  So what i find is that i destroy the dwarfs and all their open portals early, then ""enjoy the game,"" but while im ""enjoying the game"" i just think....  ""why dont i just go to the next level, what's the point?"" - The maps are always pretty much finished before you even begin mining Iron Ore, so the iron axes are pretty much useless, unless you're just RP'ing  - Kitchens are useless.  Maybe you should impliement a lock down on food within the kitchens to prevent hungry workers from taking ingriedients and eating them.  I understand you are meant to build kitchens far away from your main base with couriers going to it to manufaction ""10"" food for your army, but feeding large armies is never a problem that requires this.  Also the food requires ""4+5+6"" foods and all you get is a ""10"" food...  I get this makes ur guys work for longer, but it's just not worth it at all. - on huge maps, armies occasionally cannot find their way to new camp locations placed far away from the previous location so they just stand there bugging out until you move the camp back to a closer location - as cool as the Ice giants look, they are far too weak, you need to buff them considerably - Underwhelming feeling of victory at the end of stages.  you open the final portal, kill the 20 guards and you're riddled with feelings of ""Well i could have just done this 45 minutes ago if i wanted to...""  There's no ""back and forth"" struggle or surprise setbacks (i know you have the dwarfs, but you can see all their doors so you're always prepared or camping the opening doors). - ""Unlocked all Achievements"" achievement can be obtained before all achievements have been completed (lol wot?)Hopefully the upcoming DLCs address some issues with the game, but overall, it's highly enjoyable and recommend it for all builder/management loving gamers			"

												I really wanted to enjoy this game. I followed it for a long while, and had it in the wishlist for ages. But when Humble dropped it my lap this week I found it to be a major disapointment. The game is so dumbed down that you literally have to become stupider to play it. Logic is thrown out for convenience. And even with a Titan X 12GB, 26GB of RAM and a mid range Core i7, this game was jumpy.  "

Early Access Review
								Make sure to pick it up for under $10.This game is VERY charming and I love the colors, the art style, and the personality it brings. However it's not enough to prompt hours and hours of gameplay.The lack of a central story or progression in game leads it to fall short. Basically it's the same thing each time with what seems to be random generated small, then slowly larger islands as you move up in level/progress. It wasn't enough to pull me in to dump hours and hours into the game.			"

Valhalla Hills is a city builder game where you play Leko, son of Odin as he tries to regain his honour back in his fathers eyes by helping mortal Vikings to build, survive and become worthy enough to enter Valhalla.The game starts with a wonderful little story about how Leko ends up banished from Valhalla as he displays signs of creativity and enjoys building and doesn't seem to care for the traditional fighting ways of the Vikings. Odin tells him to go to Earth and become the God of the Builders and not to return. Leko, however, decides he can win a place in Valhalla with his father if he can just regain enough honor.Valhalla Hills is reminiscent of some of the old great city builder strategy games but with it's own nice little spin. Rather than having every building unlocked for you from the start, you have to unlock them over time by regaining honor which you do by completing missions or various objectives. You do have the option to play in 'Open Mode' which allows everything to be unlocked from the start but this is significantly harder and I would not recommend this for people just starting out. The classic mode has a nice difficulty curve and teaches you what you need to know as it goes on, explaining each building or new feature to you as you unlock it preventing you from missing out on what vital buildings do.The gameplay is pretty easy to learn if you are familiar with these types of games. You are guided through the basics like how to build, building speed, managing resources and such and each time you unlock something new, build a building for the first time or there is a new event it is explained. There is also a nice colour grid to help with placement which speeds things up a lot. Despite saying this, if you are new to this genre you might struggle. Though there is a lot that is explained to you there is also a lot that is missed out. I've played this genre for a many years but ended up making two crucial errors early on which messed up two entire missions because something very simple wasn't explained. This can become a huge problem which I'll explain further in the cons. Each mission starts you with a few Vikings, some resources to get you started and an end portal on your map and your goal is to reach and open the end portal either killing or appeasing the guardians on the way. Your Vikings can be assigned various roles but from there onwards they will handle their duties themselves with no extra input from you (most of the time). They have basic needs as well and will require things like food and sleep with some extra needs/perks like some booze for the soldiers to keep them happy and strong. Its your job to build these things to fulfil the needs of your mortals so you can conquer each map and bring yourself closer to going home. There is a nice selection of buildings from what I've seen so far but I feel the shape and design of the map can limit how you place them. The maps start of fairly small meaning your first few 'villages' will look fairly similar because certain buildings have to be placed near others for them to work successfully. Despite me enjoying myself a lot so far there are some cons I would like to mention because they are noticeable. The first is that the story starts very, very strong and I was excited to play through and see more about Leko's struggles but from what I've seen there is no more to the story. The missions themselves start with no further addition to the storyline and it seems that the opening cutscene is all there is to it. This is very disappointing because the start itself was very engaging. My second issue is the fact that if you build wrong, even one building, chances are it'll mess up your entire mission. Resources are very scarce and once you have used one up you are screwed. For example, the woodcutter has a certain range where he can fell trees and there are only a certain amount of trees dotted around the map, once he destroys those trees that building is useless and I'll have to build another using logs (which can only be made in a woodcutter). If I have no logs, like I did then I'll have to demolish a building to get some as it's the only way I found to get more. Except, I had other buildings I had placed to be built and you cannot control the build priority at all so they started building those using up all my logs again. In the end I had to restart because they had all started to starve because they couldn't build the bakery. This needs to be fixed. You shouldn't require a basic material to build a building that can only be obtained from that building. This forces you to build some things in a very specific order. My last gripe I think is directly related to my previous one. You have to create each tool you need yourself rather than it being automatically created if you have the resources. This becomes a very boring thing to do over and over again but I do believe this is in place because of how limited your resources are and to stop you using up everything making tools when you need buildings first. Overall I think Valhalla Hills is a fun game with some great features though it's lacking in any story depth. I do feel that the $30 price is too high because of this but the game is 100% worth it if it goes on sale. Another great genre edition perfect for those who are familiar with but prefer a more relaxed take on the city builder strategy genre. "

												tldr: This game is not worth 30$/€, at all.(I got my game in a 1$ bundle and still can't force myself to play it more after some islands).I wanted to like this game but it's pretty mediocre.Simple for the brain but tedious for the hands. You can enter loopholes in the production blocking the progression and forcing you to restart, it's not a big deal once you know it but it's frustrating and 1 aspect of the many poor design choices.Interface is cardboard, not really fun to navigate through. IA is idiotic, uses longer trajects than expected, they talk to sleeping Vikings. Graphics are ok but I suspect Steam pictures to be 4K or shopped. In 1080p and all Max, the render is really inferior to those pics (Tweaking GPU pannel should not be the step to match those pics).Anyway maybe for 13€ I'd be neutral but for 30€ avoid it at all cost.

												Bought this game because it's of a type I figured I'd enjoy, and for the most part I do. But the AI of the little Vikings you manage, is not very robust. Examples: Viking goes to sleep under a tree where ice guards patrol, he gets attacked, and tries to fight for a bit before running away, not towards safety, but towards an area he will be cornered, he manages to survive, but then goes to sleep in the same spot over and over again, eventually dies. Same Viking, prior to his death, doesn't chop down trees closest to the village, wanders off to where wolves or the previously mentioned ice guards were. If attacked, the vikings will run around in stupid directions, often towards something else that will want to kill them, and then go back to try and fight the same things when they have maybe 20% health left.But, even when you take this borderline suicidal behaviour into account, the game is able to keep me interested. If the Vikings running off and dying like fools is likely to drive you mad, don't get the game, if this behaviour won't give you rage, or will satisfy the sadist in you, then buy it.			"

Product received for free
As the newly-titled ""God of Building"" band together with rejected heroes and earn enough honor to rejoin your father, Odin, in Valhalla. Build, fight, and prove your worth!Story/Premise.You are Leko, son of Odin. You have been cast out of Valhalla because, unlike the other Vikings, you prefer building to pillaging. In order to make your way back to Valhalla, you need to regain your honour by leading a ragtag group of exiled heroes through a series of maps and portals until you've amassed enough honour to ascend to Valhalla. The introductory cutscene is the only actual bit of story you'll get. From then on, you clear map after map in order to earn honour..Game play.-Main Menu-In the main menu, you can view your individual Viking's progress towards returning to Valhalla. Once they've earned enough honour and ascended, they can be called back down with increased combat prowess.You can also start a new map, continue your game, and change the options (graphics, sound, the standard stuff). Additionally, you can view your progress towards unlocks here, which are presented in the form of in-game ""achievements""--some of which are also Steam achievements.Let's jump in with a new map.-Resource management-Welcome to the hills, God of Building! Here in this verdant collection of islands, you'll be building a settlement and fighting off enemies and wildlife. Your Viking brethren will literally fall from the sky and, once they've landed, they'll gather around your starting crystal and wait for you to build.When you build wood cutters and quarries next to wood and rocks respectively, Vikings are automatically assigned to the task of harvesting. These materials are used to build other buildings.Food is the most important of your resources to manage, however, because, without it, your Vikings won't work. That means no building, no hunting, no fishing, and no harvesting. Everything screeches to a halt and your Vikings can die from hunger, which means you'll likely have to restart the map. This can be done by simply clicking ""restart"" in the main menu.At first, you'll rely on the berry bushes that grow in each level. They'll soon run out, however, so you'll need to assign hunters and fisherman. Those wild animals and fish can be exhausted as well, so don't rely on them too much! Build farms and bakers so that your Vikings can have a viable food source.The other materials can be refined in order to build more complex structures. These can also be used to create tools, which make more complicated tasks such as farming and bread baking, possible. Vikings can also be considered a resource. You can request Vikings by building homes for them, which increases the max amount you can have at once. Take care because there's a max number of Vikings you can request, shown in the top, left corner of the U.I. If you send a bunch of them to their deaths in battle and have hit your cap for requests, you won't have enough Warriors to clear the map unless you shut down production buildings and stretch your workforce thin.-City building-As you progress, you unlock more options for sustainability in the hills. You begin with the ability to hunt and fish, which can exhaust its supply and run out. Once you've stripped an area of You quickly unlock more reliable options like baking and farming, which are self-sustaining. These, however, require refined materials. You also unlock things like foresters, which can replace the trees your wood cutter cuts down.It's important to plan where you're putting your buildings. The terrain, which is sometimes more uneven than others, will hinder your placement: when you go to place a building, you're presented with three colours: green, yellow, and orange. These affect the building cost.*Green-- the regular cost to build.*Yellow--slightly increased cost in order to build an additional platform to compensate for the terrain.*Orange--Greatly increased cost in order to build an additional platform to compensate for the terrain.In true city builder style, you have no control over your Viking brethren. You can suggest tasks by placing buildings, but it's up to their discretion--and range--as to whether or not they'll hop to work. Once placed, a building has an effective range, which can be increased by linking them with paths. If your buildings are not in range of each other--say, your mill, tool maker, and wheat farm in range with your bakery--then they won't function. -Battle-Warrior units differ from your regular Vikings. They can take a beating and they also won't lift a figure to build or harvest. They'll still take up your food, though, so it's a good idea to limit your number of warriors until you're ready to go on the offensive. They are key to clearing the map. After you complete a random task--i.e, build a certain building or collect x amount of resources--you're allowed to open the Portal and face the enemies that await you. You have to defeat these Portal Guardians in order to use the Portal and go to the next map. Battle consists of watching your Viking Warriors clash with various enemies--from wolves to otherworldly spirits. You don't play any part in it, but you can cheer them on as both parties take turns whacking each other.After you've defeated the Portal Guardians, you'll be rewarded with a mass of honour and transported to the victory screen. In the post-battle victory screen, you'll see all of the nifty things you've unlocked by completing various objectives such as clearing various size maps or killing a certain number of enemies. Unlocks include more buildings, which offer more survival and combat options, map types, and terrains. You can also see your progress towards other unlocks by clicking an arrow to the next screen..Soundtrack.The music is soaring and peaceful--a lot of wind instruments. It's the same throughout your building and warrior-rallying, changing only to reflect when your followers get into fights. *I found the fight music to be a little grating, especially when it shifted frequently between the two tracks every few seconds because my warriors tended to wander about and stumble into combat on larger maps. .Graphics/ Art Style.Valhalla Hills is lovely. Your Vikings are stubby, cartoonish little men and women babble gibberish. The landscape--whether bright green and rife with life or crystalline white and flush with snow--is vibrant. Snow falls, the wind blows through the trees, and the waves lick at the shore to create an immersive atmosphere..Longevity/Difficulty.You can clear maps in a few minutes or in over an hour depending on size. You can easily rush the objective or just sit around and develop a lovely little settlement--it's up to you. No two maps are the same so there's plenty of replayability if you just want to do a quick run or if you want to go on an honour collecting spree. Some maps are a juggling act. You'll need to prioritize getting  steady source of food, but you'll also need to manage building resources so that you don't run out and get stuck without the ability to build anything. There are two modes, Classic and Open Game. Classic scales in difficulty as you unlock achievements and ease your way in. Open Game allows you to dive right in with everything unlocked from the get-go and is significantly more difficult. .Bottom Line.Valhalla Hills is both fun and engaging. You can play for a few minutes, or for a few hours and no two maps are the same so you'll spend your time figuring out how best to position your buildings. With two game modes and a variety of map sizes, you'll surely get your money's worth of game time. For fans of the city-building and strategy/RTS genres, Valhalla Hills is a definite yes.			"

Early Access Review
								Good game with a bit of potential. Generally speaking it has alot of same feel and functions that you would hope to play with in a basic colony builder. I found myself falling into the familiar - yet fun - routine of trying to sort out basic problems while optimising my little village(s). Where the game started to take off more me is in the exploration you find yourself doing on maps and the constant randomness of the maps you play on. Because of the constant change I feel like trying map after map so it gets high marks for replayability at this time. Downsides at the moment - seeing as I'm reviewing this in early access - is that the 'end game' is pretty empty at this point. The few items like iron weapons and gold as an example are a nice perk for your warriors but certainly not necessary as you can just chug mead like a good viking and just have an uber army easily. The Kitchen - which  requires a solid amount of infrastructure to produce - is something that I enjoy from other games like Anno 2070 where you try to build up resources to have a cool pay off at the end. The problem is that at the moment this is one item - and it barely works even if you throw hordes of resources at it - which I found aggravating for an 'end game' item. Game is a great deal of fun the first 8-10 hrs. - then I began to imagine how modding and an increase items and building to construct would really help the game. The gameplay is fun along the lines of Banished but without the community and fun items to build at the moment. Would recommend - but it will need to be taken as a 8-10 hr. game in early access.			"

												Valhalla Hills is the game that I have been waiting for a while. Still it doesn't have large amount of content (lack of update tho)Stunning graphics and art style, it is just near damn perfect. In fact character designs, level design and building design/models are incredibly good enough. Gameplay is very simple and easy to play as a casual gamer. (Easir than Tropico,Anno and other city builder games, I assume.)  Valhalla Hills starts with a level and when you clear it, get to the exit, other levels starts to get bigger and a bit harder with different enemy types. You usually do make some buildings. That buildings does not feel important sadly. You just need some things to get for portal and exit the level... And yes you have to take care of your people (aka Vikings).  As i say before the gameplay is like ; Make buildings, lead your people to exit portal and find it, then get what it need or fight, clear the level and exit. Very simply and easy gameplay, fair enough to learn (on normal). You just have to make the building in the right place and make some adjustments. The point is ; yeah I do recommend this game. Valhalla is out of early access and still needs support. But It has a bit limited gameplay and content. Levels gets boring and starts looking like as the same (everyone says it, but it is true.), Buildings and people are not really prominent. There is some issues with updates. If you have money and you're looking for a game that you'd play for a weekend or a few week, get it.  I do not know about the game's future. But it got halloween and some updates. I hope it'll get more updates and more content(s). Still, I trust to Funatics Software since they're the group who is behind of Cultures. Game gets updates more or less... It has potential a lot.Valhalla awaits you. 74/100			"

												I was surprised by all the negative reviews because not only is this game fun, but it is challenging too. Maybe the other reviewers didn't play it long enough to encounter the Dark Gnomes or the Skeleton Warriors. Also, there is a progression path with unlocks based on the things that you do. So, the more you play, the more you can unlock and do ""extra"" stuff that you couldn't do before, which makes the game even more fun. At almost 20 hours, I have 50% of the achievements, so I'm estimating 40 hours of gameplay before I ""complete"" the game. But then there's a harder game mode that I haven't even tried for the ""elite"" players. I think too many people give up before they give the game a chance. I admit the first few hours, as I was trying to figure stuff out, I agreed with most of the negative reviewers. But now that I have played more of it and understand how things work, I found that it is a pretty fun game. Besides, the music/soundtrack is pretty darn good too.  "

So far i would highly recommend this game to anyone that's interested, expecially for the price.""  So this game is done, no longer on early access. And it's a great game all in all, the only problem's i've had is that rotating the camera is a pain and the game get's a little boring and repetitive at time's.   The dev's are making dlc as you read this (I'm hoping it will alleviate the aforementioned repetitiveness), and im actually exited to give them more of my money, I know that's weird but it's the truth.

												I like it. It's what the past 2 Settlers games should've been; simplistic economic management with overwhelming personality. Graphically appealing with an absolutely beautiful art style and an amazing soundtrack as you build up your small Viking village outside the gates of Valhalla. The whole concept of the game is to build up your village so that it can support a small force that is strong enough to defeat the guardians of the Portals. You start with a group of about 5 vikings and you generally end the mission with a significantly larger numebr. You'll unlock new buildings and aesthetics as more achievements are accomplished and missions are completed. As the game drags on, you'll eventually have some pretty large cities. All in all, I really like this game. The devs clearly love their project and have put a lot of work into it and it has clearly paid off. And come on guys, it was made with assistance from Real Vikings, the trailer showed me so.			"

												Not Worth the Money. When i first saw this game on Youtube being played i immediately wanted it. It ticked all the boxes for me, that being; RTS, Sandbox, vikings and creation. Simply to me it looked good. After completely forgetting about it for over a year it popped up on the humble bundle. I paid £8.21 for Valhalla Hills along with another 7 games which to me was a BARGIN! So i started playing it and was thrown into the story which was cool but then immediately i ran into issues with the game. I could not change the camera angle and it was stuck at an almost horizontal level. On googling this and trying to find guides i discovered you had to use the mouse wheel button, not scrolling the wheel, instead pressing it down. Now my mouse does not have the ability to do this and i met a lot of people online with the exact issue. So i then thought ""Okay i must strive forward"" and got into the game. It's fun for the first 20 minutes and you constantly seem to unlock things but i soon started to realise something. This game is fundamentally the exact same level over and over. (Unless you consider more monsters and a different ((similarly looking)) island a big change) That meaning you always have to build from nothing and get through the portal. I am unaware of how many missions there are but i can tell you from a little bit of research the game always has that same quest for you to complete. This would be fine but when playing from a nearly horizontal view it soon became very difficult to just see what it was i was building or what was going on around me. Along this i had many other simple issues (Some of which i feel might have been solved if i had played a bit longer but alas, i will not being playing anymore) Woodcutters seem to destroy all the forests and do not replant anything meaning you eventually run out of wood, your people cannot seem to find their building materials very fast even if they are in plentiful reserve, without food your entire village populus seems to die without much warning and can put your game to a halt. In conclusion i can say that this game is cute but lacks very simple things that make it personally unplayable for me.  I would say if you can get into it then it might be worth buying on sale £8 or below but for the price of £23.99 it is NOT worth it.			"

												This game is a chore. I love strategy and simulation but this ? The camera does not work properly. The maps, when you get to higher lever, are mainly impossible to use: mainly places where you cannot build anything. So you will try and try again to optimise the space but in vain because suddenly the ennemy is here but you did not have the space yet to build military equipments. That's a shame because the game is pretty and funny, the way the wikings do what they have to do let you deal with the city planning and building, but you cannot do much things. Like, I am currently on a map where only two places are ok for the woodcutter, one for the fisher, one for the stone cutter, then you'll have to navigate trhough the map, using road a lot, for the rest, while your vikings are being killed because the reste of the map is dangerous, and while you are struggling with the camera they are all dead !

												I bought this game on december the 4th and played around 14 hours, maybe a little more due to being offline regular (not sure if that adds up). Anyway i still feel the urge to play and thats a good thing. Normaly when a game is not to good its shelved after 10+ hours. I have to say, the more i play and discover the better it gets. Did i struggle in the beginning with food on larger population, now after some tweaking around with storage and couriers that problem is solved. There is really reward in figuring out good logistics, especialy when it actualy works. And most things in this game actualy work :-PI didn't come along to many bugs, at least no game breaking ones, small issues, where its not even sure if its a bug or my lack of knowledge. The game looks very good, nice details on the buildings, it's a real pleasure to look at the world while it grows and comes to life.			"

Early Access Review
								I am a huge fan of the Cultures series of games, so I was thrilled to find out there is a new game from the same developer. I was not disappointed. Valhalla Hills is incredibly fun and polished, even as an EA title. The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is very satisfying. There's a real sense of progression and it is fun to just watch the vikings go about their days on each map. The day/night cyle is especially impressive. The whole package is fantastic. I look forward to seeing what additional changes they make and new content they add, but honestly, it could be released as is right now. I highly recommend it for fans of games like Cultures, The Settlers, etc..			"

Early Access Review
								Valhalla Hills, is a fun building simulation game, where we help our fellow abandoned vikings from Asgard's gates, and fighting our way to a portal to access the kingdom.You will be throwed straight away to take care of a bunch of fallen vikings from the sky and settle a new home at mountains.  You have the mind of a home-builder, to give your fellow drunken friends a roof over their heads, where you will have the skills to build Production, Logistics and combat. These three functions will allow you to build houses, military, woodcutters etc.  Every work will be assigned automatically to a viking, where we can expand it's tools. By putting down either a home, or any kind of work related, the current building can be placed on the map, but be aware, that the map will limit you for space and offers green, for less rescources needed, yellow, for more. When you have finished building and designing your home, then we are taking the next step. A army to defend and attack the portal, you will face Guardians that will stop every single viking. By killing them, wins the current game. After that, you have a option to either move on and get new buildings or either continue with the current home you made.Overall game design, the game looks stunning with it's use of UE4 engine. The design of vikings and atsmophere really gives the feeling of it's time, where you want to keep playing. The interface is friendly and extremely simple. Unfortunately this game does not offer any kind of Co-op / Multiplayer which i could imagine bring more fun to the games content. If you like taking care of fallen vikings, be the builder and brain to recover drunk energy to fight the guardians and return to Asgard's gates, then this game is definitely for you.Here is a demo:

												A.I. is so broken that the game is literally unplayable in it's current state (with dwarf enemies enabled)You can play the game in a bulding/portal opening style until the point where the enemy faction shows up but, from that point it's a total mess and you either disable it in the map generator (but then the game gets boring real fast) or face the following issues.As you cannot directly control the behavior of your troops, fighting is a nightmare given how utterly dumb and brainless your vikings are. A few examples:- Fighters randomly engage and chase down helpless carriers while their faces are getting bashed in by enemy soldiers- Your vikings are willing to fight basically anyone and anything in their vicinity rather than destroying the cave which countinously spawns enemy soldiers who are killing them (again you CANNOT command them to attack a specific target)- Arrows fly so slow, that archers are basically useless against moving targets. As they cannot land one hit on moving targets the guard towers are basically rendered useless. Enemy minions are happily waltzing through my borders to expend their territory and build towers while the 5 archers eqipped with longbows are unable to hit them - Supply depot mechanics are broken. No gold or weapons are getting delivered to your remote army camp to train and upgrade your soldiers, so you have to continously relocate your army camp back to where the goods are stored. Dudes are crying without weapons at the depot, yet your carriers will not deliver the pile of axes from the blacksmith. - Carriers who got attacked while delivering goods will try to get that one specific item until ETERNITY at the cost of their lives- I don't even wan't to start on the logistics part... because that is just.. insanely bad.While the game is really atmospheric and brings back the old Settlers feeling, the disfunctioning and mindless A.I. renders it unenjoyable.Save yourself the trouble and skip this for now until they FIX IT, or just play with the dwarf enemies disabled.

+ Fantastic vividly colorful graphics, with some great looking environments and backgrounds+ Great User Interface making everything easy to learn and do+ The gameplay itself can be extremely addicting once you get further in the game, it's so much fun to just build up your settlement and watch all your little vikings go about their day doing all sorts of various tasks (at times I completely forgot about the main objective lol)+ A good progression system that slowly introduces you to more buildings and stronger enemies+ Nice relaxing soundtrack+ The AI while a bit slow seem to be well organized and do their assigned tasks effectively+ Some nice camera controls - I was a bit discouraged at first because you can not control individual vikings, meaning you can't move them or tell them what to do, you kinda just have to watch and let them figure things out. The worst part is when you raise an army you can't tell them to attack enemies, you have to either build close to the enemies or move the camp itself.- A large portion of your vikings typically just stand around and do nothing, this is because for most buildings you can only have 1 viking assigned, so say if I build a Woodcutter building only 1 viking can be assigned, and if I need more wood I need to build more buildings which honestly just slows down your progress.

												In general, it has a joyful arts and lovely characters. Not difficult to learn how to control and will very get used to it soon. What has disappointed me would be the mouse clicking, Sometimes You need to click twice in order to select an object. The AI is somehow stupid that will let the Vikings to the woods and get contact with the wolfs and bears resulting in death and losing a manpower quota. I still recommend this game as it is a  RTS/Simulation  like, just that and nothing else.			"

Early Access Review
								Great looking game. Fun for a bit. Needs a few changes in my opinion to make this a great game. It lacks the whats next? No new upgrades once you pass the tutorial. I want to feel like im kicking♥♥♥♥♥with my new axes. How about silver to kill wolfs that kind of thing? Still a cool game but not quite what I was hoping it would be. Now that Ive passed the first ten I understand better how to play. All the peices have to work together which requires good planning. I do recommend this game if its on sale and you like doing the same thing over and over and over...			"

												Bland, little control, variety or progression.Bought this as a form of city builder/civ like game. Interesting at first but quickly gets stale, I have played this for 12 hours and already feel I've experienced as much as I can. With this style of game I'd expect to have played for at least 40 hours before feeling I was tired of the game.Not worth £30.			"

												TL;DR: Well can i recommend this Game at its current state for 30€? No i can't. But keep an eye out for the game where its heading!!But lets get a little bit into the details why i choose to not recommend this game. I will first make a list of positive and negative issues here and then discuss it a little bit later:Positive:Nice graphics and cute lookGood MusicEasy to learnNice atmosphereNegative:Repetitive small mapsAI still a little clumsy (Early Access!)No deep production chainsMissing Ui element like worker overviewSo what to make out of this list. First i wanted to keep it short and put down what came to my mind first. I think this game has some potential but will disappoint a lot of people. If you are a strategy, building management simulation enthusiast with games like Anno Series, Cities Skylines, Settler and so on you will be bored pretty fast. I am one of the biggest fans of the early settlers series (2+3) and even like Anno or Cities Skylines but Valhalla Hills (VH) looses in every department to this games. The maps are too small, There is no real development of your settlement and the production chains stay shallow. You'll lack integral UI Statistics about your workers, their needs and item Priority.  Overall the game stays shallow.TBH i first was hyped when i read Settler developers engaging in this project. For me it looks like this game is a development of a Game Engine and proof of concept perhaps for a new Settler Game. If it is so, plz tell your customers. I feel like they want to get some bucks for engine development from light minded users. The Engine looks nice and Music and Graphics for VH are really cool. So take the engine and make a new SETTLER plz!!! With maps like in S2 + S3 and then mix in Research and stuff like in S7.But i will have an eye out for the game from time to time and check where its heading. But i believe it will not offer a deep simulation experience.			"

												Not worth the $30 price tag. More like a $5-$10 game.Super simple gameplay. Think Banished but with way smaller maps, no deaths, no real way to direct your people, and restarting every 20mins.Could be an interesting game if they made the maps bigger and made building a bit more rewarding. As is i'm just rushing axes with minimal food and blowing past the guards.The game is a cheap $10 game that you might spend an hour or two playing if you are really really into it. I was not and did not. And with the price tage of $30 I can not recommend this game at all.			"

												An incredibly well-done successor to the old Cultures games. The AI can be a bit frustrating at times, but massively improved. The gameplay does have a bit of a shallow learning curve, introducing  new buildings relatively slowly and increasing difficulty in very managable steps, but still fun. If you've played and enjoyed any of the Cultures series, chances are you'll have a blast with this one!			"

												I wanted to like this game, but i can't. I was expecting a game quite similar to the early Settlers-games, but I's very much like a facebook-game. There is no challenge and no need to adjust tactics to new situations. The only thing that's making the game a bit difficult ist the stupidity of the A.I. and the way you have to grind your way through levels to be able to build new or better buildings. Therefore I absolutely can't recommend Valhalla Hills.			"

Early Access Review
								Very fun game so far, can be very relaxing if you choose to go peaceful way or you can make a small army. I play normal game mode, where I learn the game and unlock stuff with time. Maps are very Vertical, maps get bigger and bigger, Mountains go higher and higher. Reminds me of God games genre, Black and White (but, you are not a god here, ...more like Viking Hive Mind), games like Settlers, and also very old game like ....Lemmings, as in helping getting my minions from Point A to Point B.You can name and customise each Viking you got, all of them, if not killed in battle, progress to the next area. So it feels great, to have your own people go further and further to reach Valhalla.Great music aswell. Already a fun game, Can't wait to see how this game will be updated.			"

Early Access Review
								If you have ever played and enjoyed any Settlers game, you'll love this game. It has a great artistic design that looks good and the sound design is just as excellent. I'm not a huge fan of the Viking era but this game grabbed me. The maps start out small and grow as you progress closer to Valhalla. I've logged about eight hours of this review and new buildings are still getting unlocked, which is impressive for an early access game. The economy is simplistic yet challenging to maintain if you don't pay attention, mindlessly grow your village. Buildings all tie together as well. Making bread for example requires you to build a wheat farm, mill, and finally a bakery which makes for an engaging way to lay out your village. Every map is randomly generated so every new map will be different but never game breaking and allows you to progress. The game is basically a viking themed settlers game placed on randomly generated maps. One thing I think the game could greatly benifit is from including competitive MP like a race condition to Valhalla (per map) or just simply battling each other with army camps.			"

Early Access Review
								Haven't played settlers-like games for long. I though it would be a bit dull. However bought it on a sale. It turned out that due to environment hostility, nice music, smooth graphics, hand-tuned game mechanics, handy GUI and random maps it is really enjoyable and playful, sometimes challenging. It's not simple to develop your settlement the way that does not disturb any hostile creatures. You have to invest a lot in your small army. You have to plan resources and keep everyone dry and full with food. And you enjoy every minute since it's simple, handy and colorful. Althouht, do not expect this to be a smart city builder / sandbox of any kind. This is more like an RTS - 20-60 minutes rounds following each other. So it's also time-friendly - a very important feature for me.Early Access Note: the Vikings are sometimes a but stupid. But that's playful and it's kinda improves the challenge. They take food from the wrong place, disturbing all the creatures on the island. They sometimes craft instruments for too long (at some point in time it was fixed with other production chain - I didn't really understand was that and update or a level-up). But thanks to developers the game looks finished. I do not understand why they state as early access.			"

Early Access Review
								Update (November 28th, 2015) v1.0:The game was released way too early. None of the features I was hoping for have been implemented. This game was developed by the same people who are responsible for the Settlers 2 and it's nowhere close to that quality.There's no campaign and no long-term replay value at all! You only get an infinite string of random maps with zero progression besides unlocking structures piece by piece. Once everything is unlocked, there's no incentive to continue.The logistics system is awful. Is it too much to ask for a Settlers level of quality here? That game is 20 years old!!! You can't control the supply chains, you can't really follow the logic behind it either.Final verdict: Play the free version of ""Settlers 2 Gold"" (abandonware) with the fan-expansion ""Return to the Roots"" instead of this tablet garbage.3/10 points---------- original review -------------Reviewing: v.0.10.16 (August 29th)Genre: Settlers meet Facebook.I'm a huge fan of these kind of strategy games since the late 1980s. When people remember the good old days they tend to forget how shallow most games were back then. Modern games like Anno 2070 are the exact opposite, overladen with depth at the cost of sheer fun. If a single map takes 4-5 hours to finish that's not an achievement, it's a sign of bad game design in my opinion.The challenge is to hit the sweet spot between intuitive fun and complexity. ""Valhalla Hills"" is still in early access which shouldn't be forgotten here. In its current incarnation it leans heavily towards simplicity. A little too much for my taste. The progression is slooooooow almost to the point where I feel a little insulted. Not a big deal though because you'll eventually unlock the more complex production chains.The real problem right now are the utterly missing feedback tools. There is a statistic screen that doesn't really help though. Example: You start a level and have 10 vikings right away. No one tells you what is needed to satisfy their demands. NOTHING! You're probably going to build some huts to give them a place to sleep. Some food production to feed them. Hmm... so you're producing 5 fish. What exactly does that mean? Is 1 viking eating 1 fish per time unit? If so, why are the fish simply being stored in the fishery and not being consumed? Somehow my vikings are feasting on berries they collect without having a berry collecting building.Please give us analytical tools so we can understand wtf is going on!The positives:- Visuals are absolutely stunning, pros at work!- Had no ctd yet- smooth gameplay- overall very professional feel- devs used to work on ""The Settlers 2"" which makes me confident of things to comeThe neutrals:- no a.i. opponents => you can/will play at your own pace which can be both positive or negative depending on your personal taste. Nobody ever complained about that in city builders for example. I would prefer having other tribes nearby with whom you can trade or fight. Would be intriguing if you need resource they have a monopoly on. Choice: trade for it or fight over it. Unfortunately I don't suppose it will be implemented.The cons:- too shallow right now- difficult to assess cause and effect due to lack of analytical tools- forgettable music, mediocre sound effects- no cohesive campaign yet. That was a bad surprise. In the main menu you can only select to play a new map which then is randomly created. The progression only consists of unlocking new stuff. I was expecting a campaign map with scenarios attached to each other. This needs to be implemented!!!Conclusion:Lot of work to be done. The technical foundation is extremely good so there's hope. The devs can purely focus on improving gameplay instead of having to deal with technical issues.I can only give a moderate recommendation at this point. Only bought it because it was on sale for 16 Euro and I trust the developers' skills and dedication. Wouldn't have bought it for 20 bucks.Rating for the tested version: 6/10Will update this review. Will increase the score if the devs meet expectations and lower to a thumbs down if not.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, and unlike a lot of people who start their reviews like this and then give a game a negative review I am going to do the opposite and give it a positive review. Why? Becuase the spirit and intention of the game was really good and I feel that two little things really betrayed the game and had the developers gotten those two things right, the reviews would not be mixed but positive instead. But before I get to the bit where I talk about those two things I would like to explain what I did like about this game:This game tried to encompass that good old citybuilder feel that was so popular about 10-15 years ago but is a lot less so today. I'm talking about games like “Settlers” where there is a nice mix between economic factors and a little bit of warrior management, but not too much. God knows there are already enough military games out there! So when I saw this game I honestly really wanted it to be like “Settlers” especially given that the people that made Settlers apparently don’t want to make that game anymore and it’s getting harder and harder to find a fun non-modern citybuilder (of course we have Tropico and Cities Skylines to scratch that itch). But I longed for one set in history hence I really wanted this to work. Now from an artistic perspective they actually get a lot right. I like the art style and interface a lot and the music is very fitting and adds to the ambience.The first thing that really betrays this game is the camera. It is awful and is something the devs should have really prioritized. When you’re playing a citybuilder you want to seamlessly switch between an overview of your civilization and a screen that shows a smaller area where you want to do your work. It was such a little thing but I’m sure had they got that right this game would have another 5 points up on it’s score.The second thing that really bothered me was the level system. Often they would have us build a whole town on a tiny island just to find out that the creeps at the end were quite easy and that we didn’t need to build quite so much. Then we have to start again in the next island. No, they should have just put various objectives on a single map. That would have been more fun.Look it’s a good game and had potential to be up there but sadly those two things make the game a bit annoying to play. Perhaps I may give it more of an effort in the future but for now I will give it a positive review as I believe these devs are going the right direction.  "

Considering it's an Early Access game, it is surprisingly well polished!The maps being randomised keeps the experience fresh, particularly when you progress a bit further in the game!This is a solid 'thumbs up' from me.I hope more people are inclined to try it out, as it's a genuinely fun time! :)			"

Early Access Review
								If I had to summarize Valhalla Hills, I'd say it is Cultures, a game from 2000, with a lot less micromanagement, but sadly also loosing some of its depth. Valhalla Hills doesn't has a story-mode aside from the short story of being the cast out son of Odin who needs to build his way back to Valhalla. Instead, you play on randomly generated maps where you start at the foot of a mountain. You have to build a base and prepare your vikings to open a portal at the top of the mountain to advance to the next map. The units are vikings you cannot control directly. If you encounter a map you can't win or you don't want to play, you can simply generate a new map, but you loose the progress of the current one.New buildings, biomes and stronger enemies are unlocked while playing by a kind of achievement system. On one side it gives the the game some progression and it doesn't bombard you with too much information, on the other side, the beginning is too easy and feels repetitive. It takes around 6-8 hours to unlock everything, but I hope the developer will add more content because it gets quite repetitive after 4 hours.As I've mentioned above, the building part is quite nice, but the victory condition requires some more polish. After building the first few buildings to get building materials and food, you can assemble a little military force and start fighting your way through to the portal. the portal is usually guarded by several enemies that can either be killed, or you can sacrifice materials to bribe them. Sadly, the difficulty to produce these materials varies wildly. I had a few games in a row where I had to sacrifice water and plain old wood, very basic materials to bribe the strongest enemies. Other times I had to produce high quality products to bribe weak enemies, so fighting was much easier. The developer should put some more work into this ending to make it more satisfying for the player. Building a large and expensive monument could be a solution.The mentioned fighting system isn't very fun either as it is partly luck. each unit does a fix value of damage to the enemy, but sadly you can't tell your units whom to fight first. The difference between winning and loosing a battle isn't preparation and tactics, but the luck of which enemy gets attacked by your stubborn vikings first, and if the enemies focus your vikings or if they spread their attacks over your units. Even worse: it can happen that a viking gets hungry on the way to war and wanders off to get food or sleep while the other are fighting. This makes fighting kind of luck based, something I don't really like in a building game. Some general orders for your vikings would be helpful.The game uses the Unreal 4 engine to produce a good art style.The game is held in a cartoon style with exaggerated animations that can easily create the aquarium effect well known from games of the settler series or city-builder games. Sometimes you just want to take a moment and watch your vikings while they work... typically German, I know. The game looks especially nice during night time when all the different houses have torches in front of their door. The sound is good and fits the setting, yet nothing special.All in all, Valhalla Hills show a lot of promise in it's early stage. It still needs a lot of work, but the team has a lot of knowledge in building games and a strong publisher covering their back. I look forward to seeing new content. If you like the genre, it is already worth a purchase.			"

												Cute little strategy game that reminds you of good old Settlers. Fights and warfare is one of the game s weak features, it would be better if it didnt have fighting parts at all. It gets tedious and boring after playing for a while, so it is better to play it just one map and then stop. It greatly misses some narrative or mission quests that would keep you going for more. Overall it is not bad though.			"

												I bought this game for $1.  It's fun, but I don't think I would pay more than that.  It's kind of fun to play games, but there is no real reward for getting a viking to Valhalla and no real end game.  I think once this game has some sort of campaign or rewards, it will be better.  Definitely worth a shot if you can get it for pretty cheap.			"

												For the first hour or two I was very engaged and delighted by this game. Reminding me of the old Majesty series with a Banished-like twist to it I was quickly locked in for several hours and nights of gameplay. However, after playing through a dozen or so of the ""missions"" I quickly realized that this game is not very deep and quite frankly is not all that exciting once you realize ""that's it?"" is really ""that's it"". This game is about 10 years too late to be a solid contender for modern games. Pros:Fun premiseGreat colors and charming graphicsSimple to learnCons:Lacking depthNo real need for intense strategy; same plan works every timeUI / Controls not all that greatNot worth full price, maybe worth it on a $1.99 or $0.99 sale. Try Banished instead or reinstall an old RTS.			"

												This game is actually quite good, the strategy is neat and the concepts used are smart to represent a developing civilization. Now it is a pain sometimes that you can make woodcutters and miners collect exact resources from the map so you can place a building there, it can be so hard to place buildings at times with almost no where available. I also reach a point where stone is difficult to collect as you just run out but I have no doubt there will be something later game for me to use for that.			"

												This game could have been sooooo good, and it's just NOT... at all. I purchased it because it somewhat reminded me of Black & White which was released 13 years ago and thought Valhalla Hills should blow it away. Valhalla Hills was really inferior. The gameplay was boring, the tutorials lacking, the camera angles and movements are clumsy, the characters literally have no character. So disappointed. Requested refund. Developers - go back 13 years (13 YEARS!!!) and look how much a game like Black & White blew you guys out of the water... like a complete fail. So sad for you....			"

								This is based off of just 1hr of gameplay, but I think this game is awesome.. I enjoy building... I messed up a few times in the economy at the start of the game and I would have to restart, but then I realized my mistake and learned from it. The graphics are great, and the movement(gui) is easy to get used to. this game somewhat makes me think of Black&White but without the big diety and you choosing to be evil or good to your settlement.

												It's an OK game, but too much is up to the faulty AI. You can only control your buildings, not your Vikings - they do everything automatically and the way they make their decisions is not clear. After a few hours of gameplay, I found that I was googling too much about how things work and the whole thing had just become a quest to unveil the mysteries of the Viking's seemingly random behavior instead of a fun game to play. At this price, there are much better games in this genre available right here on Steam.			"

												Mind you, I bought this game in a bundle for less than $3Ignoring the original price, Valhalla Hills is fun game with decent gameplay. Nothing really stands out though, so it may felt like any other city simulation games out there.Starting the game, Valhalla Hills only introduced you to few structures, and as you conquer each map and gather resources, new kind of structures will be available. This helps new player getting accustomed to new structures, seeing as in-game explanation is frustratingly minimum. You had to figure out how each structures interacts with objects in the map, as well as other structures in Valhalla Hills.Overall, Valhalla Hills is a decent game, and will keep you occupied for a few hours. But, in my good conscience, I cannot recommend buying this game at its original price. At least wait for huge discount, or buy it in cheap bundles.			"

												Classic feel strategy game with a very cute and beautiful updated style. Very reminiscent of The Settlers (IV is the one i know) and related to other games such as Caesar III and Stronghold. The game offers two difficulty modes, one a gradual difficulty curve which is nice and easy to start with and getting more difficult at a non threatening pace through the means of an unlocking system. The Other I haven't tried but appears to be more challenging from the off; probably made for your second play through.I bought it (and two other games) from Humble Bundle for $1 which is a steal as I already have 19+ hours out of it. All in all I have really enjoyed this game and found it to be nostalgic with all the visual benefits of modern technology.Simple and sweet.£24 does seem fair for the game at full price. If you like old strategy games like those previously mentioned you must give this a try. I can imagine it to have lots of replayability. If nothing else definitely worth picking up in a sale.			"

												So, I bought this to play on my Mac. Almost immediately requested a Steam refund.The touchpad doesn't work at all: as soon as I touch it at all, the viewport zooms in as far as it can, and then I cannot zoom out at all. (Unplayable.)So, I dragged out an old trackball I had in a closet; but there appears to be no way to tilt the view with the mouse *anyway*, despite having gotten zoom working. For reasons unclear, the pointer occasionally jumps across the screen, or ends up somewhere slightly other than where I'm trying to move it at the end of the movement, leading me to click in the wrong place. (Unplayable, ugh.)On a *literally top of the line* trash-can-Mac-Pro (that's dual AMD FirePro W9000 cards! Although this isn't a gaming machine, I should seriously never be *able* to make any game play slowly on this workstation), the interface is laggy, and the graphics strangely jumpy. (Not unplayable, but at least unpleasant.)I'm genuinely sad that I can't speak as to whether the game is actually any fun; although I struggled through the first three tutorial missions, the vast majority of my time and effort went into trying to place the mouse pointer where I needed to, to click whatever interface-element was dictated by the tutorials; I was barely even able to put any effort into paying attention to the instructions themselves.(The one takeaway I *do* have for non-Mac gamers: the interface *is* a little backwards and strange; it seems very unpolished, in terms of user-experience. This almost feels like it was designed to be a tablet game, and then the decision was belatedly made to port it to the PC?)			"

												I had this game near when it was first released. They have improved some things since then. I enjoy this game a lot. It's very relaxing. The models are ok, but I love the lighting effects. I think that maybe they could have graphs that show trends in things like food, and a prediction of when you might run out but really it isn't that big of a deal.This isn't a game that requires intense strategy, at least not for me. It's a game where you try to do as much as you can, with as little as possible early on, then watch as your city grows to consume an entire island, and bathe it in the golden fires of your people.I love that the bonuses to your soldiers are permanent too. I think fighting the enemy AI would be too difficult given that you have a limit on how many vikings you can call down per session.			"

												Valhalla Hills is a city builder that is quite similar to early Settlers games. Unfortunately the whole game feels highly unpolished and it's looking very unlikely that any of the issues will ever be fixed.The basic city building gameplay is decent but not great. The production chains are rather simple and the game is missing a number of core features and UI tools I'd expect in a good city builder. I strongly disliked the courier network system, too. Combat is also pretty terrible, but that's frankly normal for the genre.The procedurally generated maps are rather repetitive and there's no proper campaign mode. In Classic mode you simply keep playing through new random maps slowly unlocking new buildings and stronger enemies. The game could have used much more variation with the maps and the objectives. There's also the Open game mode where everything is unlocked from the beginning, but you are still playing on the same repetitive random maps so this feels somewhat pointless.Production values are not particularly good either. I wasn't a big fan of the highly generic art style which reminded me quite heavily of mobile games. Music is decent but way too repetitive and the sound effects are minimal at best.Perhaps the biggest issue, however, is that the game is full of bugs. I ran across two critical bugs and lots of minor issues. On one map the final portal was unreachable, so the only option was to restart. On another map my military units got stuck on the scenery and the only way to fix this was to create a brand new military camp. These bugs are even more annoying as the save system in the game is extremely limited.With more development time and extra content Valhalla Hills could have been a pretty solid city builder. Unfortunately, the game was released way too early and many of the bugs and problems were never fixed. As it is, you are much better off playing something like Settlers II 10th Anniversary Edition instead.I played the classic mode long enough to unlock almost all the buildings but didn't ascend any of my vikings to Valhalla yet. The game just got too repetitive for me to continue.The good:- Core gameplay is decent enough, if not particularly deepThe bad:- Extremely repetitive maps- Poorly designed UI- Generic art style- Courier network system is annoying- Repetitive music and minimal sound effects- Extremely limited save systemThe ugly:- Very buggy, including several gamebreaking issues			"

												I just can't do it, put some time in and I have to say I am pretty bummed because it looked great. Glad I got it for cheap on Humble Bundle.Pros:-Great graphics, especially at night.-Terrain encourages you to think about your layout and infrastructure.-Interesting idea of sending Vikings to Valhalla based on how they perform.-Unlock stuff as you keep playing, giving incentive to keep trying new things.Cons:-Not fun. Obviously a personal thing, but it was the biggest for me. I have to decide where to invest my time and this game made me not want to hit the play button. -I quickly started to just not care about my village or my inhabitants. There is no point in the game since there is no real campaign, just bigger and bigger maps where you have to do the same thing over and over starting from scratch every time.-Feels unfinished and like it should be played on my phone/tablet.-Way too expensive. If you plan to try it wait for a sale. Like a huge one. -Frustrating bugs, sometimes things just don't work. Vikings don't use available resources, odd graphical lag, etc...-Minor last point, I get the cartoon-graphic thing is nice sometimes but it's just silly here. It felt like watching Nickelodeon or something, not leading a band of Vikings to Valhalla.Skip it and check out the many other better and cheaper offerings in the genre.			"

												Because so much of the game is automated, the rules behind the systems are too opaque for this to be an engaging resource manager--I don't know why I'm doing what I'm doing, and it doesn't seem to matter much anyway. The tutorials aren't much help.The camera is annoying: you can somewhat, unsatisfactorily adjust the tilt and zoom but you can't swing around the Y axis. No matter what you do, you'll never feel like the camera placement is right. Valhalla Hills was made in Unreal Engine 4, but it doesn't show on screen; the developers could have accomplished the same cartoony aesthetic in Unity.Who would enjoy this game? Maybe children. Their standards are low enough. AVOID			"

												You are the exiled God of builders, sent away by your father Odin because he`s an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and now have to work your way back into Valhalla. You start out on a small island and move your way to larger and larger land masses. All fine and dandy until you get to the game mechanics that don`t really work that well. The warriors are gathered around a large pole and unable to locate an axe even if the all-seeing mighty Odin came down from the heavens and shoved it up their arses shaft down and them sqeezed them all into vaze-like ornaments. They do respond when enemies appear but the combat is as exciting as watching drool going down my 6 mo chin. The rest of the buildings kind of work, but there`s not clear way of getting an idea of the level of production a building has nor can you see the radious of a building after making it.You go on to a repetitive series of missions where you get access to more and more buildings and vikings. The camera work is shabby, the visuals are something a pimple faced teenager can do in a couple of sleepless nights in his parent`s basement, the feeling the game gets you is like the one of watching paint dry. The first settler games, released 10 years before this were better made. This is a half arsed attempt from the devs. This is the first review I`ve written, despite having more than 100 games just to tell people just how boring and bland this game is. It has absolutely nothing going for it. Go get Knights and Merchants or the early Settler games.			"

												After having this game on my wishlist for a long time where I just couldn't get myself to take the plunge; I finally got it on a humble deal.  Must be honest and say that if I had paid more for it, I probably would have asked for a refund.  That being said, the game is very ""okay"", not bad, not great either.  Was quite surprised to see I only played 3.6 hours (over a two day period), it felt much, much longer.  Gonna give it a thumbs up since there's no ""ok"" option and I don't think it deserves a thumbs down.			"

												Didn't care for it. I felt stupid because I didn't understand why I couldn't control anything or make any decisions. Turns out all you do is build some buildings. There is some strategy to building the buildings, but generally looks like if you had the basic formula for which buildings to build in order then you could use that on every single map. It might be a good introductory game for someone who is new to PC gaming and strategy games in general.			"

												Hija,I am still pondering about this game, there are plenty of things I like, as a old Settlers 1 2 3 and 4 player it is very easy to see the influence of those games in Valhalla Hills. It also has Culture's in it but I don't remember enough about the game to really see this part of it in this game.The graphical style fits the game, its relaxed yet has a lot of atmosphere, it has most of the buildings you expect. Woodcutters, Sawmills, Wheat farms, Mills, Bakery's etc. There is also the military side of the game but here I start to feel the lack of the game.You see, I never feel like I am in any kind of trouble, if you played the old settlers, you knew that at some point the AI would swarm you and destroy you quite easy if you are to laid back.In this game, there are no Romans or Vikings or Egyptians, just beings that live underground and come out of it, starts building towers (without units in it..) and then spread its influence across the map, but it never really attacks, I never ever build a guard tower, 9 military units suplied by gold to increase damage and brew to increase health is enough to win the map.The AI of your own Vikings aren't that clever either, they don't spread goods around when your start to build a lot of buildings, quite often I see a gold mine have 5 ores, yet my smelters aren't full. The couriers that they give a tip for, to use when the map gets larger and more populated, are very bad at actually moving goods around. This with the fact of some key functions, like being able to manually say what items to store in storage buildings doesn't help, and you end up with 20 sticks in it, which aren't that usefull..Forresters like to start planting trees not near the building itself but far away for some reason, and you can't put where they work yourself like you could in the old settlers. All in all its fun and yet frustrating, its not bad but not good either. Perhaps, future DLC will add or improve. So while I recommend it, I would say a 6/10.

								**Keep in mind, the game is early access and as such, the critic I have for the current version of the game might not stand afloat in the near future.**I would love to yell at the top of my lungs ""Go buy this!!"". But at the moment it's simply too unbalanced, and the AI is Frightening poor. You can have half of your population running around trying to eat the same apple, to the extend that they end up starving to death... Beside that, the balance is mostly based on how much food the different buildings produce. Currently it's at the 'Banished' Level, at which you will need 40-50% of your population in the food making chain. lastly but not least. Being unable to choose when you want new vikings to join your settlement (beside limiting it by building houses, which brings on a whole other kind of problem). Is in my opinion not the smartest, if starvation befalls your city for a period, it can permanently kill off a huge amount of your max population you can have in your city. Because the darn stone just keeps spawning more and more people.These 3 things really feels like a thorn in my side while playing. If they are corrected (or looked into), I would Love give this a thumps up, and yell to all my peers to go buy it or they will miss out in something amazing. But currently it's simply too.. wonky.Also this might not be needed, but.. It's a settlers game kind of game.. It's lives up to that in every way. So I have no worries about this turning out amazing!			"

YouTube™ Video: ➜ A Quick Look @ 'Valhalla Hills' (GeForce GT 640, Win 10) 

			Views: 277		

			This game is available here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/351910/ PLEASE NOTE: At the time of this video the game is still in Early Access.		

A cool artstyle and gameplay greet you in this city building style adventure.  You spent your whole life in service to the gods of Asgard. You died an honorable death. You earned your place in the halls of Valhalla. But when you knocked on its gates to receive your final reward, none answered. Odin has turned his back on your people. He underestimates the Viking spirit. He underestimates you.Force their hand as you lead your people past the dangers waiting on Valhalla Hills and fight to prove your honor, your strength, your worthiness. Look after your Vikings, gathering food, chopping wood, and mastering the complex economics of wilderness survival. Reach the portal at the top of each mountain, and shout your battle cry loud enough for the gods to hear. If they will not give your people the reward you all deserve, then by your axe, you will take it from them.   -  Recommended!			"

												I really do not get this game. The pacing is really slow - both in the sense that you will want to keep the game on fast forward at all times, and in the sense that buildings very slowly (one per mission). I keep hoping that it will get more fun when I finally get to the point where there is some strategy to consider, and it's slowly getting there, but it's taking ages to get fun. There is also the issue that missions generally don't work very well; nominally there is a boss fight, but odds are that the wolves roaming the countryside are far deadlier, resulting in a rather unticlimatic game with a ""peaceful"" option which doesn't work because you still need to build a large military to deal with the afore mentioned deadly wolves. Finally, there is the pointlessly tacked on valour mechanic for the vikings. It's not terrible, but I can't recomemend it because it takes so long to get interesting.			"

								From what i've already played of this game I absolutely love it. It's a rather fun take on a rts game by moving it into 3 dimensions of movement compared to the the 2.5d games like starcraft. I really enjoy the gameplay and feel of this game even for it being early access which if it's not done properly can stall the game development if there are too many bugs and unplayability. These gents at Deadalic Entertainment and Funatics Software have already given a rather very stable and enjoyable early access launch. the progression feels very fluid for the first few missions and gives plent of helpful advice in the early game to get you familiar with the game mechanics and how they work. I also enjoy the procedurally generated maps so that no playthrough is ever the same. This game has a lot of potential even to show the game industry that not all great games just come from the industry giants.I also love the artstyle that the devs used to build there characters. I can see a lot of great things coming to this game to help flesh it out to bolster its enjoyability. I highly recommend this game to players such as myself that are looking for that little something differant that sets this game apart from the rts genre. 8.75/10			"

								Remember the old settlers and how they used to be played? Place buildings, establish production chains, develop infrastructure through roads and couriers and recruit geologists to find ore. Its pretty much the basics of the game where the obstacles are found in the terrain, wondering dangerous animals and various enemies.Unfortunately it´s another game which presents the challenge in form of building restrictions, the terrain is not always pleasant and you may not be able to put up your chain of production where you wish it to be. Why do I state ""unfortunately""? Because I love these type of games along with pretty base building and always hope for a different challenge rather than space restrictions.Your vikings will tend to themselves, gather the necessary raw materials and build the tools necessary to do their jobs. When you build a military camp you decide the number of vikings stationed there and their roles, you move the camps around to danger areas to fight foes and back to safety so your battle tired vikings can rest.I will recommend this game with the carefull notion that not every aspect of the game seems polished in regard to ressource management, sometimes your vikings will starve with food nearby and there are a few problems with fetching items, but overall I have not yet runned into major issues. It is still a ton of fun to build your village and see it prosper.I will recommend watching a youtube video or two and visit the forums.			"

								The game is playable there are some glaring problems.For starters when you are starting out you get very small maps.  If the map is poorly generated you could end up on starting right beside some guards before you even get a chance to build anything - ie, your dead.Food regeneration rate on maps is horrible and building wheat crops takes a ton of time.  You can put in fisherman but for some reason they stop producing.  Hunters lodges will wipe out all the wildlife.  Those little berries you pick dont seem to come back.  By the time you are ready to take on the gate your troops could be starving.If you use the altar at some point it may ask for ale which requires wheat and water.  Now your army gets unhappy and they starve.Twigs - you dont get enough of them.  Everyone needs em including some structures.  Your army will take them all and all your workers need them for tools.  The drop is way too low from your foresters.There is no balance between a military victory vs an altar victory.  You cant do both it seems.Hopefully these issues will be addressed.			"

								Don't bother with this game:   Too many silly annoying things.   The Vikings won't make lumber even when surrounded by trees. They will starve to death because there is no teeny weenie little berries to eat, but there are so many rabbits, bears, fox, fish and bread in the storge lockers they cannot hold any more, positively stupid.  Oh and just when you are about to get a viking to Valhalla the game freezes and all your progress is lost - all new Vikings at zero again and two days later same thing happens again.  Where are the saves that go to the steam cloud - gone: overridden by the game's  not a cloud cloud - and just vanishes I guess. So no, Don't waste your money on it until it becomes F2P.  Even then you are just wasting your good time.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is cute in graphics. There are some interesting buildings to unlock and the portals are also interesting. There is some fun factor in the game. The maps start small and grow larger and hiller as you go. I still play cultures and settlers (not the last one).But the main challenge of this game is the food..The consumption of food is over rapid. The production of food is slow. So, you will get blah and blah are too hungry to work. There is no balance between the production of food and the intake of food. I was told bread is better for your vikings..So stupidly I played until I got a bakery going. It made no difference. The little vikings would pick up 1 to 2 things and go zooming around to eat food, wash, rinse, and repeat. As far as I could see there was no difference between bakery, fishing, wild berries, and wild mushrooms..No buffs. This is also bad because you are alloted so many vikings. I suppose if you stuck with the basics and just built food buildings it might even out (but I seriously doubt it). The space alloted to buildings is wacky. I am not talking about map size (maps you start small and they get bigger as you complete the map). The game has potiental, but I doubt the food will change. If you like food challenges ..this game is for you. If you are looking for older settlers or cultures .. this game is not for you. I had an easier time defeating the mobs from the portal than feeding the vikings..To me the game would be okay for maybe 10 bucks..not the price shown.36 Vikings - 4 fisheries, 3 Hunters, and a bakery could not feed 36 vikings. Just LoL..FAIL! I also noticed that the vikings will go way out of range to get food, but won't walk 2 buildings away to get fish.. Berries are no help because the idiots don't give them time to grow back..This game fails because feeding 36 vikings shouldn't be an issue ..Pathing is horrible.. They carry 1 item at a time..1 facking item.. XD.. To date this the most horrible balanced game I have wasted money on..It is NOTHING like Cultures or earlier Settlers games..infact it is an insult to those games..			"

												The onboarding is a mess. Everyone is tired, hungry and bored. I spent like 20 mins trying to figure what to do with every single button. The user experience is so bad and improvised it looks amateur. They planned a different game mechanic but didnt care to explain it properly. When you finally figure, it doesn't pay off. Looks like a complete waste of time			"

												No, please no. I thought it was a classic Settlers style kind of game, which it is to some extend. The only difference here is that you feel like you do even less. This lore isn't meant for lore either, I get that, but it's way too stereotypic aswell. I don't feel like I'm playing a game, but more playing an old school point and click game, rather than strategy and empire building. If you like that way of gameplay, be sure to check this out, just don't have any expectations if you want to build and grow armies like one of the Age of games, or grow an empire like the Settlers.

												This game is absolutly interesting!! I love this game. Actually, this is the game created for anybody who is not idiots. You have to think, you have to calculate time, make decision what gonna build first, which enemy to kill first, bla..bla..bla.., so you must be a clever person before you can love this game. Therefore, I hope anyone didn't recommend this game will be smarter and review again. Intelligent brain is waiting for you!!			"

Early Access Review
								How are the reviews positive?This game should be called F*cking Vikings Starving. It's ridiculous. It's hard to tell if your production capacity meets the requirements of your population. Even if you go nuts and build farms, mills, bakeries, and kitchens, inevitably your f*cking vikings starve when there is food nearby. You can take the advice given on the forums and keep everything in a local vicinity, connect everything with paths,overproduce food and even store it in containers- however, your vikings will still f*cking starve. You'll spend hours collecting resources putting food production at the forefront of your priorities.. and your f*cking vikings starve. There's not even an easy way to tell if your viking's will even have enough food. I wish I had not bought this game and instead kept my $20 bucks and used it to feed a real viking, because at least then I'd have some control whether it f*cking starved or not. I think this game has finally broken my early-release game buying, most games suck when their done why on earth would they be any good before their final stage?I do like that you can rename the vikings. I guess to be fair they should rename this game ""Vikings you can name to be your friends... Inevitably starving to f*cking death"".			"

								Played this game for a about an hour and got bored really quick. It looks cool, and the reviews make it out to be good, but all you do is build, and restart, build, restart, it's just a rince and repeat game that doesn't have much going for it, at least for now. It's early access though, so I can't complain too much. I did refund it however. Hopefully the devs make improvement down the road. 2/5 in its current state, definitely not worth 15 dollars though, more like 5 dollars.			"

								First of all, the game is in no way ""bad"" in itself. There's a LOT of potential to be had from this game.Since it's still early access, there's bound to be more stuff comming, and I CANNOT wait for that. (Unless this is DayZ in disguise, huehue)TL;DRNot bad game, much potential.Is in balancing process, so feels too easy.Does not feel incentivised to build huge production chainsWould not recommend in current state (state of balancing), but keep a lookout on the updates. I, for one, cannot wait to play it when that part is done :)It pains me to give this one a thumbs down.ReallyIt reminds so much of the older settlers games, which will always be my favorite series in this genre.The problem is, after the first 20 minutes, it's just the same every single map.Also, it's the developers behind the game series Cultures, another great series.In each map, or island, you have to open a portal and get through it. This can be done by either fighting the portal guardians, or making a sacrifice.The problem here is that the sacrifices take a max of 5 minutes per map, and the same with fighting. It's just way too easy, and kind of boring in the end, even frustratingly so.For the most part, I haven't had to construct any interesting production chains, since even though you can build a long chain to bake bread, the sacrifice only needs like 15 wood logs, the easiest resource to obtain.Sure, I could just build myself those chains, but with zero reason, there's zero incentive.As I said, having to vote this down pains me. But until devs make it ""harder"", or give me any reason to invest more time into each map, this verdict will stand.			"

												Wow. This game is awful. I've played less than an hour because it was incredibly laggy on my windows 7 pc. I recently upgraded to windows 10 and the game just crashed on the loading screen. This does not happen to me with any other games on my computer and didn't happen to any before I upgraded to windows 10. I'm incredibly dissapointed since this seemed like a cute city builder type of game that I normally LOVE to play. Recommend? I heavily advise others NOT to buy at full price. I would even hesitate to purchase this at a discount since I honestly can't even play it and when I did, it just wasn't what I expected. Waste of money IMHO.  "

												Agree with most of the other negative reviews.During the first 30 minutes, there were a lot of nice things to learn about the game, such as that roads extend the reach of buildings, in a dynamic way, and that you get a lot of the same vikings back as you play the game, but ultimately, the game is repetitive, and not in a fun way. Depending on RNG, you might even start close to enemy units, which can lead to a sort of ""half death"" for your people, where they kill them before you get a proper chance to build an small militia, but don't kill your base, meaning you just get new vikings, that struggle to get new resources and new weapons, all in a cycle of slowly unlocking new buildings and map modifiers, in a vein attempt to introduce replayability to a game that really is just not fun enough to begin with. Only good thing, is I got this from a humble bundle, so I didn't pay the full price.			"

												Nice idea, frustrating execution.I really like the general idea of a Viking themed simulation game, especially with the sort of overarching progression that the game is aiming for. The game runs well on my 2-year old midrange PC, and I find the aesthetic pleasing - especially the ice themed enemies, which shine prettily at night. It really hits that sweet spot of concept and visuals which hooked me in right away.However, when it comes to the gameplay I find it frustrating and slow. On the first play, there is a LOT of text to read and understand, while there's not a lot to actually *do*. Even when gameplay gets more advanced, there's little real choice regarding the builds you make. Supply chains are finnicky to set up, difficult to monitor, and there is little control over whether it works. You can't choose which Vikings fill which roles, or provide them any specific orders. Vikings working at a building very slowly carry the resources they need from wherever they happen to be lying, and it's painful to start the game and have to wait several days for the first axes to be ready to use. This frustration is a little mitigated by the Courier and Carrier systems, where you can add workers to a building to stock it with resources, but this adds different frustrations - such as the Leather you start with being stored (irrevocably) in a building you don't want it in.The Vikings themselves are not very clever. I have had several starve because they wouldn't walk another meter to get food, and one or two get into an endless loop of being beaten to a bush to pick food, turning round, walking home, repeat. Some woodcutters have endlessly punched trees, complaining about missing tools, even when there's a perfectly good axe sitting in the next building across. This is where the lack of ability to easily monitor supply chains gets very annoying, because hungry Vikings can break your food supply chain and make others starve.But these supply chain problems mean it's impractical to get an army going early on, and hence some maps (with restricted space and lots of enemies) become unfun, with many restarts required to find the pixel-perfect building placement.When the map specifics are nice, the stars align, and you do get things right, it's a satisfying experience watching your well oiled machine produce warriors which can carve Ice Golems into table centerpieces. But these experiences come along too late in the game, are infrequent, and outside of those experiences the game doesn't execute the fantasy well enough.Play this game for the aesthetic and to appreciate what others in the genre do really well. Don't play it expecting extended fun, even in the Dwarf Fortress sense of ""fun"".			"

												It's hard to decide whether to recommend this or not, because I personally have a soft spot for the Settlers.  One of my earliest memories is playing Settlers 2.  So my judgement is biased.It has good and bad.  I like the viking dudes running around in the wild, doing manly things and just hanging out, scratching their man beards and what not.  I like the 3D style of building a town uphill towards the top.  I like the graphics, the lighting, day/night cycle, battling ice peoples, and everything has a real historical reference.But I don't like how damn annoying it is.  You drop a foundation down and just sit there and tap your finger, and stare at friggin Ragnor, while he's rolling around in the grass, checking out a butterfly, like ""BUILD the STUPID building man!""There is so much waiting around, and not a lot of user interaction.  You have to wait for the tool to be available, then for the lumber, then you put down a foundation, then you have to wait for it to be levelled, then built, then the worker gets there.  You wait, you wait you wait some more.  It's also kinda laggy and the loading screens are like 3 minutes.  I can run GTA 5 no problem, and this games graphics are almost non existent.  Like I mean there is actually nothing going on that requires CPU usage.  There is also some weird debug graphics glitch thing that popped up and won't go away. I dunno.  Yes, I push fast forward a lot, but that's no fun.  Everyone is scrambling around and that really breaks immersion.  The game is just too anal about doing things in a certain order.  If I build two lumberjack huts, and I STILL have to wait for lumber in the second level.  Nope.  I'm out.It's not really a good game because that supply system makes it boring, but if you don't pick it up and play it, your kinda missing out because there isn't any game like it.			"
