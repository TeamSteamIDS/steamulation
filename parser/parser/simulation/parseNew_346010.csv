								So I gotta be completely honest here...This game is freaking beautiful. The animation quality, texturing, modeling, and even the music are all fantastic!Even the menu for the levels is addictive in a way... I'm actually HOPING they get around to finishing this because the framework of it is really astonishing.My only complaint is the lack of a tutorial; it kind of sets you out in the middle of the first level with the VERY basic blocks and such and doesn't tell you about certain mechanics.For instance: You can add steering devices for wheels. STEERING DEVICES FOR WHEELS. I'VE LITERALLY NEVER SEEN ANY OTHER GAME DO THIS BEFORE.Truthfully, I feel this is going to be one of those great games once (or if... though I hope not if!) the devs finish it.Really I think I'm going to play more, because this game is something special! :)			"

								This is the BEST game I've EVER played with my two boys, aged 7 and 9. A+++++ 11/10, best ever. Together we've learned about physics, gravity, centre of mass, flight, ballast, geometery, engineering, problem solving, and other great topics. As a bonus is it probably the first game my wife has shown any interest in too! It's also sparked more interest in the kids toward real-life building, and they've dusted off their lego and are often inspired to build in real life after playing.In the course of 'beating' the first island we built a number of tanks with progressively better steering and durabily, a couple flying machines including a kamakazee model, a crane, a couple cars, and a number of mostly useless but fun ""prototypes."" Awsome.I've found many games like this have been too complicated or been burdened by a cumbersome UI. This game perfectly strikes the balance between simplicity and complexity. The game mechanics are deep enough to stay very interesting for a long time, and simple enough that we've never been frustrated. I really hope the devs stick to this winning formula they have here and just work on content, refinements, and more building pieces.			"

								Really nice game!For the price would recommend to anyone, who can sit for few hours and give it a try.Good+ SteamPlay (Win/Mac/Linux) support+ It's cheap+ No limits (expect size, which can be disabled) on what you can build+ All part available from mission one+ Little instructions given (just some basic stuff), and you have to use your head to figure out your own approach for each level/stage+ Playable even with low FPS (quite useful if you have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC)+ Nice visual style+ Relaxing sandbox experience (at least for me)+ Active DeveloperBad- No multiplayer (dev's plans are not clear on this point yet :( )- No steam related features yet (achievements, cards, ....)- Controls can be clunky at timesBottom line: best early access game of 2015 (if you are not fixed on multiplayer games)UPDATE: Feb 23 2015: V0.04: We have Mac/Linux support on Steam now (plus a lot of other changes)UPDATE: Jul 16 2015: V0.10: Steam Workshop supportUPDATE: Oct 24 2015: V0.20: Unity 5			"

								I've only played the first 4 or 5 levels, but I would say the game is worth the $7 for early access already. My favorite part about Kerbal Space Program was unexpected and hilarious explosions, and my favorite part of playing with LEGO was thinking up weird death machines. Besiege has begun to combine those interests, and I'm excited to see where development takes it.Hopefully there will be many more blocks, weapons, etc to build with. Right now we only have the basics.			"

								Besiege is a physics based building game where you create all kinds of crazy medieval siege engines to complete objectives ranging from delivering wood to slaughtering sheep. You want a flying block of flamethrowers? Go for it. You want a giant trebuchet? Go for it. You want to make a p*nis? You naughty little so and so, go for it anyway.+Nice graphics and simplistic level design suit the game well+The possibilites of what you can make are endless+The sandbox mode provides a great way of creating and testing different ideas+Cheap and great value for money+Physics are pretty realistic+Variety of different mission objectives as previously mentioned+A lot of parts to choose from ranging from simple to use blocks to more complex components+The game has a very basic tutorial which forces you to learn more complex things for yourself encouraging trial and error therefore increasing play-time+Doesn't require high performance to be playable as long as you use the timescale settings-There are only fifteen missions at the moment and I can't find any timescale for them implementing all of the missions which are currently unavailable in the game-No Steamworks features-The turning mechanic doesn't feel right and is sometimes quite clunkyVerdict:8A great physics based builder that's worth the small asking price despite the current lack of content.El K.

								Besiege.Man, this game. I watched a stream of it and i instantly bought it.For the first hour, i thought i was playing the game wrong. Because the game encourages creativity with your machines.Yet all i built was a block with wheels and studded with cannons.Is that at all original? Nope.Did it even work? Kinda.Was it enough for the objectives? Sometimes.Did it get wrecked? Yeap. Did it look totally awesome? Hell yeah!So far, when you start the game, you are greeted by the main menu which is basically the title of the game, an options menu and a moveable 3d model of the earth (or rather, besiege's version of the earth). Much of the parts of the globe are clickable and they correspond to a level or area in the game. When you click one, it takes you to a table top figurine looking 3d model that again you click in order to choose a level to play in. For now, ipsilon is the only playable area. There are more areas to come soon in future updates.It was a little hard to figure out how to make working siege machines but when you figure it out, those knights had better watch their backs. Aaaaaand maybe the sheep too. Yes. The sheep. They litter the fields of ipsilon and just graze there like they expect you to just leave them behind. Diabolical little critters, those sheep.Getting their blood and guts all over my nice siege machine, clogging and gumming up the works with their entrails.Clever little sheep. Clever indeed.I really like the charm of the game itself, as it reminded me a lot of crush the castle on iOS only much more expanded and you aren't limited to trebuchets. I hope the devs add more parts, more ammunition types besides the flaming ball and the bomb ball, more weapons and more customization options as well as more enemies cause crushing a ton of em under my siege machine is just plain fun.The game looks absolutely beautiful as it gives off that kind of tabletop looking vibe and the fact that your siege machine can and will take damage and you see the damage actually happening. Your siege machines have to be structurally sound otherwise your machine could break, burn or explode before you even get the chance to move the machine, kill anything, or blow up stuff.I just can't get over the tabletop feel of it. It is just so damn cool looking to me.I recommend it to anyone that likes the medieval era kind of war, anyone who likes simulations and anyone who enjoys building games. Support the devs!9 Dead sheep out of 10.Would be a 10 when they add in new stuff for sure.I hope they add goats in too.			"

								This game is a whole lot of fun with a bunch of creative levels and spawns a whole bunch of creativity inside of you. Besiege also taught me a lot about myself, such as-Engineering is probably not a viable career choice for me-Everything that can go wrong, will go wrong-Things you didn't know that could go wrong, will definitely go wrong-The things that go wrong, will work out better and beat the level for you-If you have no idea what you're doing, it's all about luck and how your machine explodes-I like to find complicated solutions to simple problems because instead of playing all these hard levels that I saw all the videos on where people made 360 noscope machines and mobile Nazi death camps, I ended up playing on the easy levels, like where you just have to kill sheep, and seeing what complicated ways I could recreate Hiroshima on these poor animals.

								Last summer I played through a game called Katawa Shoujo. After beating the game, I took a look at my life and asked myself, ""what the f*** is wrong with me?"" After realizing how empty my life was and how I would never find someone as perfect as Lilly Satou, I began to spiral into depression. A hole had formed in my soul.Fast forward to two weeks ago. I find this game, start playing it. On my fifth or sixth attempt at making a bipedal transformer robot to annhilate a herd of sheep with a self destructing catapult I realised something. For the first time in months I didn't feel dead on the inside. I felt alive. Suddenly my life had purpose.And that purpose was to cold-bloodedly murder every motherf***ing sheep in sight.			"

It is already very, very well functioning.The building is intuitive, sleek, and polished. The physics are good, and the destruction is pretty decent already and I hope it'll only continue to improve. I absolutely love the art direction, and the art that is in the game is very well done. The music/sound is decent.

								Besiege is insanely fun. Mowing down hordes of tiny cannon fodder with your self made death machine is strangely enjoyable. The price is fantastic, £4.99 is a bargain right? Correct, especially considering the fact that this gem is still in early access. The inclusion of the steam workshop allowing players to share their creations with the community is another positive. The graphics are a plus too, with a nice 'fluffy' style and gorgeous in-game freeze frames. Overall, Besiege was something different, a breath of fresh air and a definate recommendation.			"

								I never knew about Besiege until it was featured on the Steam Store, and I'm glad I did because its such a gorgeous medieval-themed physics builder. As soon as I saw the unique artstyle in the game I was immediately allured.Besiege is one of those games where it takes me back to feeling like a child, constantly using my imagination and creativity to build the structures necessary to conquer a level. The ambient music is serene and fits the game perfectly, and in general, this game has so much potential. Buy the game, its only 7 bucks! Support the two developers into making this awesome game.

								Awesome. Just awesome. And here's why:You know when you go around on youtube and see someone play a cool game, and you're all like ""OMFG I WANT THAT GAME TOO!""? Well, Besiege is one of those games, but most of those games are most fun when you didn't watch those videos, because it will spoil alot of the fun. But Besiege on the other hand, is early access, so the most of the fun has yet to come. Also can you create many, many, many different sorts of things, and thus creating almost endless joy.Now, let's get down to business.Pros;-Physxx duuude! -Wide variety of levels, also lots of room to mess around in sandbox-It's early access, and for one of such, it is quite big.-Unlimited resources-Good framerate. I mention this because my laptop can't handle much, but yet, if i keep the graphics normal, it works fine.-Fun to look at-graphics-Being indirectly able to share creations. I feel like they should be saved on Besiege's own database. My laptop broke down, and I lost everything.Cons;-No way to change objects' color-No tutorials for (for example) aviation(=flight)-No information on objects' mass-The enemies, except for the archers and the bombs, don't even touch you     -> You should have a button for this in levels with knights, so that you can make it a bit more challenging-No custom maps (yet?)-Not alot of information on what stuff does. This doesn't necessarily bother me, but for unexperienced players this will be a problem.-The basics should be explained at the 1st stage, the weaponry at the first fighting/explosive stage, and so on.Conclusion;Great game, but minor things that I expect to be updated and patched pretty soon.One of my all-time favorites 8.7/10 - Cpt.

This game is so much fun for the price, and more content is on its way. This is a MUST buy game. I am enthusiastically waiting for the upcoming updates  -HiPFiRED If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

								Besiege is a game where the objective is to build creative and/or effective mechanical structures to destroy villages.  As you progress, the villages build up their defenses, so you'll have to build creatively.  Integrate smashing, explosives, cannons, fire, catapults, and ramming into your village destroying death machine!Pros:-Pleasing, vibrant visuals-Easy to learn-Well done menu that puts all the building components at your ease-Great game that makes you think-Good price for such an abundant gameCons:-People who aren't puzzle gamers may find the game tedious or boringRating: 9/10 for the average gamer, 10/10 for the puzzle gamer.  Either way it's a great title!			"

								Besiege is a gem hidden among the trash that has recently come to steam, (cough cough grass simulator). A great game with good physics, beautiful graphics, a relatively easy to use building system, and overall fun gameplay. Smash sheep, splatter soldiers, or just build to your hearts content, the endless possiblities that besiege offers are simply astonishing. I am writing this review in early access, however from what I have seen so far into the game, although only being one campaign level, and a bit of a bugged sandbox, I see a game with the potential to turn into one of the best games on steam. If you enjoy a game that gives you the power to smush over affectionate sheep, create elaborate contraptions, and build practically anything, this is the game for you. Once more, a simply superb game and I hope to see it really live to its potential.			"

I hope this grows into an amazing and huge game, so far the levels are great, though I always wish there was more. Maybe they can add workshop integration for player made levels? Hopefully there will be a level editor soon so that we can already build our own levels, so theres always more fun! This is in EA, so there isnt a lot, but the concept is fun.			"

								A great game, liked the visuals. If you are apprehensive about touched up images being put in screenshot section of game, don't be. It looks exactly like it indicates it would. Also mechanics play out really nice,there's lot of freedom when it comes to construction of machines. Lack of proper tutorial can be the only factor that I consider to be against this game, i.e. it expects you to know the mechanics of how torque of rotors affects the flight pattern and so on. It would be nice if they included this information in game, not as a ready to build model or anything but some material explaining how various parts behave. Even if they don't there's going to be community made guides about this stuff, so not a deal breaker.Major factor that's in favor is that it plays incredibly well for an alpha. Framerate drops when there's many blocks but it may also be due to my system not being powerful enough, it's on the minimum side of requirements. Camera needs some time to get used to.			"

								I saw some creations around the Internet and ended up buying it.Well...BAD IDEA, I CAN'T STOP PLAYING THIS THING, IT'S SO AMAZING,I WANT MY LIFE BACK!Ok now, seriously.- Game EngineBe aware, if you build things really freaking big, it will eat everything that your computer have.GTA V on Ultra? Piece of Cake, 60fps.Machine with 478 blocks? Can't go past 3fps when I hit play.- PhysicsThey DO work, and it's amazing. You build a plane with less weight on the front? You will only make loops. You build a catapult without reinforcement? It will break in half.The game devs are probably fired employees from Ubisoft, and they stol all the physics before leaving.- GameplayBuild things, Duh.Preferably things that brings death to knights and sheeps. Yeah, those are the best things. Big freaking death things that explode half of the map.- SoundMeh. Calm and relaxing.Change this for god's sake, WE'RE EXPLODING THINGS, GIVE ME SYSTEM OF A DOWN OR MEGADETH!- GraphicsNot important on this game. It's like Minecraft, it's not about the graphics, it's about the creative possibilities.But they're pretty good.- Early AccessStill with 20 levels, but the Sandbox Mode is enabled so you can keep creating things. You will take a lot of time to clear those levels by the way (Flying baloons, I'm talking to you guys, you made me waste 40 minutes only on your level).That's about it. I deffinitely recommend this game. Waiting for the future updates!			"

 Besiege? Where do I begin? Well, what is it? It's like Call of Duty, except less shooting and more quality. They give you the tools and the objectives, you make the epic machinery. Essentially, it's a medieval construction simulation, with some exploding sheep.How's the gameplay?I play on a really crappy laptop. Pretty sure it was handed down by my grandfather when he was a child. Anyways, this game still runs smoothly on it. I mean, when I add 124 cannons to my invention it does lag up a little, but c'mon. Who needs 124 cannons, really?The controls are very easy to learn. As long as you know how to read, you shouldn't have trouble. It falls into the category of easy to learn, but extremely difficult to master. There are literally unlimited possiblities. You just need to have the skills and the knowledge to bring out the true potential this game has.How're the graphics?Ugh. They're gorgeous.You think that literally popping enemies open, watching their guts and blood splatter all over the map as you shred their bodies to pieces with your deadly innovation, wouldn't be beautiful? Well you're wrong.Every animation, every explosion, every texture, is spot on. Definitely one of my favorite styles of graphics too: clean, organized, easy to navigate, and elegant. You see, I like to be elegant while hacking flocks of birds to pieces and sending pieces of rock from castles and monuments flying into the air. It makes me feel better about myself.Is the game buggy? And no, we're not asking you to compare it to an insect.It does have a few glitches and faults.But really, don't we all? *whoa man that's deep*Sometimes, I'll be driving along in my flame-throwing-saw-wielding-semi-flying-ten-wheeled-construction-of-destruction, and the wheels will just decide they can't even anymore, and they flip up in the air and my innocent little vehicle getting torn to pieces. By the air. That does happen. Sometimes.But the bugs certainly don't make it unplayable by any stretch. If anything, they're just funny. I'm usually too busy laughing my tonsils out to actually get annoyed at the glitches.Is it worth the price?YES. If a game costs less than the price of a sandwich at Burger King, you really can't go wrong. And Besiege does. Enough said.Does it have any replay value?Absolutely! Every level leaves you with the feeling of: 'Did I make the awesomest and most effective invention possible for that objective?' ... 'Could I have done it faster?' ... 'Could I have done it without blowing up my entire invention?' And, generally speaking, that drives you to try again, even if you've already beaten the level.So, all in all, is Besiege a good game?Good? GOOD?!?!  IS IT GOOD?!?!Lol yes.It's amazing.It's better than the meal at Burger King that costs the same amount of money, it will last you a lot more time... and heck it has less saturated fat too!And get this: it's not even done.There are only 2 areas publicly available as of yet. The second isn't even all the way done. It's in freaking Early Access. And it's this good.If you don't buy this, and by the time it's done it's an epic game that costs a lot more and has a huge fanbase, don't say I didn't call it out. Do your dietary health a favor, skip your lunch at Burger King, eat some celery instead, and buy this game. You won't regret it.~ caleb4est			"

								Besiege is one of those ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" types of games, but after a few attempts at creating a genocidal contraption of doom, you tend to learn the ropes. As these areas of your mind are unlocked, and you see your ridiculous machinations spring forth and wreak death and doom across the land, you cannot help but feel a form of excitement, and joy within your heart.As of now, there is only one landscape you may burn, but the others are in development.Seems rather legit for early access, and I cannot wait for future updates.Get it now while it's rather cheaply priced.

								One of a kind!You create ""vehicles"" to do jobs on maps to proceed to the next map.There are blocks, wheels, weapons, armor and even items for flying. So you can build a spidertank, a giant flamethrowing spider, a flying flamethrowing cannon-spider, or just an exploding spider-on-wheels. Or no spider at all. Whatever your sick mind can produce.Sounds strange, but it's a fun game. And for a very fair price too!The good- Great visual art-style. Very nice and fitting- Super intuitive UI, that's how you make an UI!- Great innovative concept/idea- Superfair price!The bad- No REAL tutorial (yet?), so at least on the first map where you have to evade obstacles, you're left alone clueless. But if you're into puzzle-games, especially physics, then this should be an added bonus :) Maybe this even is intentional, but optional hints could not hurt morons like me :)It's still Early-Access so things will change. Yet it's already worth playing and will occupy you quite long. Admitted, if you know how to do things, you could rush through.			"

What you think it is = Create medieval machinery to acomplish multiple tasks throughout the different levelsWhat it really is = Create the most ridiculous machine to complete the first level.After playing you'll question how a $6 low budget alpha at version 0.05 can be tons more fun than the newest AAA title to be♥♥♥♥♥♥out onto the public.In short, its much like KSP for pshycopaths.Also; dear devs, please add multiplayer, medieval battlebots are what we all want, Why you might ask? Because my broken barely working hunk of randomly placed wood is better than your broken barely working hunk of randomly placed wood and I need a game mode to prove it. Summary: Buy this game because it is absolutely amazing for its price with devs that update and add new content very often, its not overly buggy, its tons of fun, and has massive replayability just building the craziest thing you can, and thats all with only 1 world and a unfinshed sandbox zone.

								This game is the best. The building system is simple enough to pick up easily, but complex enough to be limitless. The 20 currently available levels are incredibly fun, with countless solutions, and the sandbox mode will entertain you between updates. It runs very smoothly, and the lighting engine is just milky and delicious. While sometimes it will skip frames calculating physics, there is an option to modify timespeed, so you can always adjust it to something more plausible. The community has come up with some crazy stuff, so you can just download other people's hard work when you're too lazy to think. And, you can release your ""ingenious"" garbage to the Workshop, only to be shot down by massively superior projects. Anyway, have fun.			"

								I have been eagerly awaiting the day I could scrounge up a few extra bucks out of my college-peasant pockets to play this title.  I have messed around with this game a bit and I have to say: It's pretty great.  Not only does it allow you to lay siege upon medieval buildings and sheep, but it actually challenges you to ""think outside the box"".  For an early access game, it is worth every cent.  So far, bugs are minimal and gameplay is enjoyable.  The controls take some getting used to, but you will be constructing mobile destruction units in no time at all.  What's more, the implementation of realistic physics is astounding.  I'm an artillery-buff myself, so of course I treasure every moment  where I can utilize the CANNONS of Besiege!  I strongly suggest this game as a purchase and at very least a wishlist item.  PHYSICS! EXPLOSIONS! GORE! CANNONS! What more could you want as a repressed continental tyrant!  Thank you to the makers of this game.  I'm looking forward to future updates. Now let me ask those of you who think you want this game...Do you think you have what it takes to conquer?~kingofhearts2540~			"

								1) Started besiege2) WooW I'm here to build medieval sieging machines!3) Built cool looking catapult.4) Realized, that there's a way to build caterpillar tracks.5) Destroyed catapult.6) Built a tank...Now let me tell you..The thing we all probably like is, that you can use all blocks at the start of the game and you don't have to unlock them (That might be actually more interesting but..) There is something like unlocking system hidden in you. You'll say ""What are all of these things used for? And you will probably use basic things during your first hours in this game, but in some time you'll learn, how does all the blocks work, and then you'll find many combinations of them and ways how to utilize them. (And it will not take a lot of time.)Every day I play this game I get many ideas of new things I can construct, that I don't even have enough time to build them all.  And your only limits in this game? Your imagination, building skills, and in some ways even your computer. But My calculator-like computer runs this game on 50-60 fps, so you sure don't have to be scared of that. :-)			"

								Amazing game. Who DOESN'T want to make helicopters or catapults? Who DOESN'T want to spent 30 minutes making a car to ram over sheep? Who DOESN'T want to make a hammer and fling a knight into space? Who DOES like gravity?house Con 1 Only three I can think of. It is extremely easy to kill stuff. I mean, if you poke it oh-so slightly with a spike, it dies. Silly Thing 1 Why would sheep follow something that's been killing other sheep plenty of times..? But I can't complain, because it's in early access- but the price promises you what you expect out of this game. Con 2 No level editor :(                                                                  Con 3 Nowhere near complete and needs more levels. Fun nonetheless.Con 4 Multiplayer should be added. Imagine building a giant crane and flinging your enemy into oblivion... :PPro 1 The flexibility of the game is amazing. Not really any restriction. Tons of things you can do.Pro 2 Since I first made this review, workshop support has been added so it's even easier to get people's creations!Pro 3 It is incredibly smooth, and if it starts to lag, in the top left corner you can slow down time.Pro 4 You get to gib sheepPro 5 You can spend HOURS and HOURS and still not get bored (of killing sheep, ofcourse). You make multiple creations- and if you want you can put them up to download, too.Pro 6 Saving machines     Pro 7 You get to kill sheepPro 8 Sandbox mode. To kill more sheep.Pro 9 4 god powers- Click to ignite, drag, zero gravity and invincibillity. Adds to pro 1 I suppose.Pro 10 Water cannons. Sprinkle your enemies with pellets of high pressured water to death!Pro 11 Skin packs, that you can turn on and off for different blocks. There are probably more pros that I have missed, but these are the basic and the ones I could think.                                                               10 out of 10.			"

								If Minecraft is like LEGO, then Besiege is like LEGO Mindstorm.You can build many machine (or with mods, any machine!) and play with it! The sky is the limit! Literally, since when you reach the sky your machine will be frozen due to freezing temperature.Or your computer is the limit! Since large machine tends to drops frame rate but that's a legit reason to upgrade your rig!Built a lot of contraption, watch your creation wreak havoc on enemy soldier or on itself!With an epic skills and epic gear, you have access to wide arrays of blocks you can use, each with it's own purposes.Physic calculation? Who needs them. Just try putting things, and retry if it exploded.Besiege show us example on how a game with ""Best Use Of A Farm Animal"" award should be.Yaks? Check; Sheep? Check; Exploding yaks? Check; Sheep that tries to ram you while on fire? Check.This game is great! Trust me, I'm an engineer!			"

								Hey look, buddy, I'm an Besiegineer. That means I siege castlesNot castles like ""Hogwarts"", because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of magistrology. I siege medieval castlesFor instance...  How am I going to siege some monstrosity of a tower from ruining my skyline's integrity? The answer... Use a ballista. And if that don't work... use more ballista. Like this heavy load, trebuchet, little ol' number designed by me... ...Built by me... ...and you'd best hope... It's not pointed at you.			"

								OK, so it's definitely early access.  The game is not finished, there's a campaign but only about what looks like 1/4 of it is actually built.  So what does that mean?Do you buy a game like this to play a campaign?  Probably not.  You buy it for the physics sandbox and the fun you can have trying to make the damn things fly without crashing.So, the campaign as it is, is fun, but over quick.  The great stuff is, there's an almost infinite number of ways to 'win' each mission depending on what you like to build, for example, one mission I think you're supposed to build a flying machine to kill birds, I couldn't figure out how to build one that'd work so I put a bladed windmill on a post and raised that in front of the oncoming birds and chopped them up, job's right.You'll find this game will challenge your ingenuity, like what do you do when you need an angled piece of wood?  The not so great stuff is, it's short, not always intuitive and has a reasonably steep learning curve.  If you invest into it (plus there are already a lot of youtube tutorials) you'll be rewarded.If you like to build, buy this game.  End of story.Oh and Developers - some decent audio please please please....			"

								Now... If you were to choose to buy any game at $7, this would be the one. You get better graphics performance, even on a terrible Macbook Air 11"". 11"". Do you understand how amazing this game is?I love how you can just switch between sandbox mode and campaign mode so seamlessly. Seriously, does anyone realise that any other game would have to reload the game and it's rule components? Less time wasted, more time building!Anyways... If you're a real cheapskate, this game on sale is literally the best bargain since Steam accidentally listed CS:GO for free. Get this or riot.~ Aureum Ignis			"

								An average day in the life of besiege:-Build some kind of car chassis.-Realize that the car chassis is completely unfit for the task at hand-Pimp the hell out of the car chassis-Realize it is extremely weak but very heavy due to all the stuff on it-Put a ton of braces on it- Watch as your massive unholy creation from the ninth layer of hell utterly decimates the land, and you writhe your hands in satisfaction-Just before finishing a level you get bombarded by a chicken who scrapes one of the bombs launchers you have on the side of your majestic beast-The bombs goes off and what doesn't go rocketing into the air burns into a crisp and ends up in a red and black pile of charred nothingness on the flat ground.-Sit there-Contemplate life choices-press the space bar again twice and thoroughly enjoy the process just as much, but the first thing you do is drive right over and kill that damn chicken.11/10 best game.

My regular ending of each successful missions be like:""♥♥♥♥♥ttttt, that actually worked!? In your face, medievals!""I'm not at all far into the game but the satisfactions gained from each missions straightforwardly tells me that I simply like the game. The first thing to point out is that the game has a very short tutorial at the start and it will expect you to do a bit self-learning by doing its earlier missions that are all catered for you to use various tools and weapons for your machine's design. Unlike plenty other games, this game doesn't require you to unlock a certain materials or weapons, rather everything was made available to you from the start and there is no currency in the game thus you are able to design your machine with maximum capabilities and resources. Upon knowing the available selection of materials and weapons and how they work, you are then left to your own creativity on how to accomplish a mission and it can be done in any way possible, only restricted by a maximum size of how large and wide your machine can be. Basically, this game does not have a high learning curve and it doesn't require anyone to master physics to enjoy it. The game looks and runs brilliantly. The UI is simplistic enough and you won't have to go through much exploring to get used to it. You may need to get used to the camera's movement and control at the start but I assume that is the case for any games at all. All in all, it's a great game to play from time to time and if you decide to play it, don't think too much. Blast em all on and watch the sheeps and soldiers flew and bleed to fulfill your enjoyment.Update: Updated for Steam Awards. I placed it under nomination for ""Did It Work?"" category under ""We Didn't Think Everything"".			"

								With the recent announcement of both multiplayer and level editor, I could say its gone a long journey, Besiege is one of those games which let you do whatever you want, may it be a tank, to a snake. a plane to a truck. Even if your building sucks, it could work, and thats enough to fight the peasants, the frieghters, the knights and castles. You really don't want to build? Then download from the community workshop, it has hundreds of creations waiting to destroy, fly, fight and crash.I'd say its one of the better games I bought in a while.			"

								Since the dawn of video gaming, we've all experienced the most satisfying kills, the most satisfying slaughterings... Years ago, when my journey started, I remember being told to conquer the enemy armies of elves, undead, orcs... And I clicked. I clicked on sheeps. The jubilation of sheep exploding due to the sheer force of my hundred clicks. Now this game... This game is heaven. There's hundreds of sheeps! And your clicks have evolved into a builder with only your imagination limiting the ways of magnificent destruction you can unleash on those sheep. 10/10, I'll go back to thinking of ways to destroy sheep.

								DISCLAIMER: Let me just say that I understand this game came out under a week before I made this review. Okay? Okay.This game is amazing. Compared to other early access games, it is outstanding; the graphics are polished to perfection, the controls are incredibly user friendly, and it is simply a good game all around. That being said, I only have two complaints.1: There needs to be some other form of tutorial in which the game guides the user through making different types of machines, possibly even giving the player examples. I only got so much from the tips, and couldn't figure out how to build a plane whatsoever. Regardless, I made death machines. My concern is that unexperienced or close-minded players will begin playing, not understand, rage, and leave a bad review. So, yeah. Just a suggestion.2: There is not much content. Only one island. And a floating cube-sandbox thing. Here's a pros and cons list for scrubs who can't be bothered to read my paragraphPros:-destroy♥♥♥♥♥♥with fire and explosions-amazing graphics-no bugs (so far)-very polished-i think you can build planes-only 7 bucks-you can skip a level if you're stuckCons:-a grand total of 16 levels, including sandbox-needs more n00b-friendly tutorial-...that's about it.IN CONCLUSION:Amazing game while it lasted, would pick up instantly when it gets updated.9/10, gr8 m8			"

								Fantastic game concept, beautiful yet simple graphics, great interface and all for £5.50!One of the best game purchases of my life. longtime gamer.I have looked through the rest of the reviews and it looks as tho the people who do no not recommend the game do so on the basis that they don't believe there is a lot of content, the fact is that for your £5.50 you get 2 islands with some 10 or more levels on each and the sandbox enviroment but you create the content and gameplay for yourself by building whatever your imagination will let you.  The devs are constantly updating and introducing new content which is great.So to summarise - if you are creative and then like to be hugely destructive this is just the game for you. I can't recommend it highly enough. Keep up the good work.			"

								I can't recommend this highly enough.  While you'll likely begin with a simple wooden go-cart covered in spikes/saws/drills/giant spinning blades, each level nudges you into building some new type of monstrosity, and oh, the monstrosities you shall create.  You'll build catapults, you'll build flying machines, you'll build things that look like medieval torture device carnival rides.  Your engineering failures will be massive and catastrophic, and just as much fun as the successes.The range of weapons and mechanical pieces provide plenty of options without being redundant.  The mechanical bits (hinges, springs, joints, etc.) allow for an incredible amount of freedom in design (Tip: each activated piece can have both its parameters and hotkey reassigned - e.g. to give each of two opposing springs different elasticity and make them pull separately).  Everything functions smoothly, the physics engine is excellent, and the artistic design is (subjectively) very easy on the eyes.  The Early Access aspect appears to be mainly in content, with additional levels being added over time, but also making it an absolute steal for the price.			"

								I killed a bunch of people with a bomb-launching catapult, and then came home to play Besiege and got to do it all over again.EDIT:In all seriousness, Besiege is a great game. Get it if you enjoy building or destroying things. The game looks great and runs great. I recommend you to buy it, but when the game is fully out, because all the levels are not out yet. Thus resulting in you finishing all of the levels early and resorting to sandbox mode to have fun. If you get the game when it is out of Early Access, you'll have more options. If you want to get it now, that's fine- but it will get boring quicker. Great game for great price. 9/10			"

								Besiege is a realistic medival warfare simulator... If flamethowers, airplanes, giant mechs, and much much more of that caliber existed in the middle ages. Besiege is a demonstation of the fact, that a good physics-engine, vast creative tool and plasing visuals is more than enough to make an excellent game - a game that anyone that anyone who enjoys sandbox-games should at least give a shot.

YouTube™ Video: Besiege - A fun physics game! 

			Views: 1,204		

			Besieged is the perfect example of making physics entertaining. This game implements realistic physics into a medieval siege, where you build a physics based mechanism and use it against objectives...		

Besiege is a fun physics based game where you build a mechanism to destroy different objectives.The building in the game is very smooth and certainly polished as there are little to no bugs, which is suprising as it's early access. There is a wide variety of things to choose from and the ways you can build are very limitless so that creating things can be done with a lot of freedom, you can build huge moveable towers, seige engines, catapults and even flying machines!When it comes to the execution of your builds everything is physics based, your machines structure is affected by gravity and many other realistic factors, this allows you to apply common knowledge to your build and also makes it challenging and introduces this games aspect of experimentation. It is very enjoyable tweaking things around and making things work and at the same time it is quite hilarious watching some dumb builds fall over and sometimes explode. Destroying objects such as farm animals and players is quite hilarious, watching masses of bodies spinning in the air without limbs. God i'm weird. Destroying buildings is like knocking down a tower of playing blocks, and it's quite enjoyable to watch!The game is quite small but it is definately worth the price, although the base of the game is small, it seems to be a game I would personally easily spend 50 hours on!

								This is a game that I highly recommend. It's one of the few non-broken steam greenlight/early access games.The engine is beautiful and I'm really impressed by the visuals. It's a really nice toy-box kind of look that gives a kind of serenity to your slaughter. It also runs great and I have had no performance issues whatsoever. I haven't heard how it runs on low-end systems, however. I'd be interested to see it run on potato-like laptop to see if the minimum specs listed are truely accurate.The building works well and personally I don't believe that there is anything they need to do to improve it. It's intuitive and works well. It's pretty clear what the parts do from the 1-2 word names that the parts have. I'm also assuming that there is going to be more parts added to the game as the alpha progresses.Overall the gameplay is fun and has replay value. A major concern of mine that the physics engine would be broken or glitchy turned out to not be true. Everything works how you would expect it to and the consistency of the engine makes troubleshooting your designs easy. My first straight run took about 100 minutes. However, I am going to replay it many times to see just how ridiculous of contraptions I can make to complete the objectives. With some really minor improvements and expansion to the content already present, as well as levels being added eventually, this is going to be an even better game than it is now. Well worth the $7. 8/10 "

								Besiege is a fun physics based contstruction game, set in the medevil times, where you construct a structor of descruction, of your design, with the objects, tools, and weapons handed to you to make use of, and it's fun!Looking at the videos, I thought that I wouldn't know how to be good at this game, starting it out and playing for the first half an hour, so I gave up for a little bit and went to look at some community pictures, and after looking at a few of them, I went back in the game, played for another half an hour, and I was destroying everything elegantly, and improving from then on with better and better structures of destructions.

			fun creating stuff with physics =) More info at: http://www.ksalue.com/_/game-shock/besiege-alpha-preview-r696 End video song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVafDaVTVkk ~Twitter:...		

The game is also really polished too, really slick UI and main menu, and just surprising really neat for an alpha, and the only thing they actually need to do, from what I can see, is just add more complex building parts, more control options / custom controls, a better tutorial with better descriptions of parts, and the rest of the games content in terms of the games campaign which will inevitably be added later on.What I would like to see, since right now in ever level it's a one shot kind of attack where you can't re-arm yourself, is check points in the more later levels where you go to a certain area in a level to save, repair, reconstruct, and replenish ammo, from there you continue the level and finish it.There isn't really anything else much to say right now other than the game is good looking with nice graphics, simple controls, and that it is a really fun game with a really high replay value. Also, it's a game where it would definitely benefit from having mod support, with community content flowing into it to keep it alive and kicking for a really, really long time. Worth the purchase? Heck way it is.Shameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.			"

								Great physics engine and building game with literally endless possibilities. You'll need to be creative yet practical to destroy, steal, and kill your way through a limited yet somewhat challenging series of levels. It'll take you at least an hour to figure out all the mechanics, as there is no tutorial for each and every part. The graphics are wonderful making every screenshot you take seem like a piece of art. Bugs in this game are more hilarious than game-breaking.Pros:- Endless possibilities- Download other people's creations- Nice set of levels- More to come- Lots of weapons and parts- Gorgeous graphics- Nice medieval style- Flight is possible and even necessary for some levels- Good priceCons- No tutorial- Somewhat slow updates- Singleplayer- Community is not well-developed past youtubeOverall 8.6/10			"

Make a machine that launches projectiles only to realise the projectile will launch your machine.Besiege is crazy. You just can't help it but laugh to your heart's content once you see your elegant and complex catapult being launched instead of the rocks it was supposed to throw or your 30-cannon platform being torn to pieces due to the backfire. You will fail, my friend. But you will laugh. And then, you will try again, until you reach victory.Besiege is a physics-building hybrid, where you construct elaborate war machines with the objective to clear each stage. Anything that comes to your mind, you can craft it: from old-fashioned trebuchets and helicopters to tanks with windmill-like contraptions that maul your foes and needle-armored cars. Your imagination is the limit, and you will spend many hours building the weirdest machines you can imagine. Engineering in Besiege is simply beautiful. Just like Lego, you snap together blocks, wheels, pistons, weapons and many, many more while praying your machine is gonna work, let alone move. Following trial and error, you will imrpove your machines or build new ones. The way to realise your goals has many paths, and you are free to follow the one that suits your imaginations. The best thing you can do, and I strongly reccomend it, is search on the internet for ideas. I have seen (and built) flying machines that can carpet bomb the entire map, catapults that self-reload, transforming robots and more. Before you grasp the basics of this game, it's worth trying to follow some guides and build some other hilarious and crazy stuff first.When trying to complete objectives, keep in mind there's a limit in size to what you can build. However, the free-build mode allows you to alter the game's objectives and make your own, allowing you to go as big and wild as you want.In story mode, things are simple: you got a build phase, where time is stopped for you to build your machine, and action phase, where you witness you machine in action as your enemy's troops are trying to destroy it. You can swap between phases as often as you like, something really useful for your experimentation.On the downside, there's not an actual story to follow which is not a bad thing. The music gets a bit monotonous at times, and it would be nice to see some extra graphic features added, like more grass, buildings and trees, since mostly the objectives are present in your map.As an early access game, I absolutely reccomend you grab it. Although there are not many campaign stages, its toy box and free build features are unrivalled: you can make the biggest, meanest, and most hilarious war machine and watch it destroy a tiny village full of men and sheep. It feels pretty close to completion than other titles, and I have the feeling it's gonna be big when the full version will be released.RATING:Gameplay: 8.5/10Presentation: 7.5/10Enjoyment (replacing story): 8/10Unique Factor: Engineering Freedom: 9.5/10OVERALL: 8.3/10 "

Early Access Review
								*THIS GAME IS EARLY ACCESS*Therefore alot is not available, currently only a makeshift sandbox world and 1 continent with 15 levels that can be replayed over and over.First off, this game is beautiful. The maps, the displays, UI, physics; just all beautiful.I had difficulty in the start because all my cannons would fire at once or my contraption would snap from tension and being to rigid and thats when I realized that this is not just some clicking simulation, no sir. You need to account for torque, being too rigid, weight, moveability, wheels snapping, key mapping, or even just being a big rubberband of wood and wires...Once you have a stable block of wood that doesnt crumble or self destruct you can add some weapons like cannons or flamethrowers or spikes. Now you don't want all your cannons going off at once since its a one shot weapon so you'll have to change some key mapping for those. Oh right, lets not forget; every action there is reaction, so if you have a weapon on a flimsy limb the force can snap it off...So after meddling with things maybe you want to head to sandbox (if you're not already there) and try building ballistas' or catapults, all capable with the handy dandy wire thingy that lets you quickly expand/contract it like a rubber band. Or there are these things called pistons that expand/contract themselves into smaller/larger blocks. There are so many possibilities right now it's crazy.Tired of being on the ground? you can make a FREAKING AIRPLANE. No jokes. Being an early access there are some bad things of course.a) Trying to change item when building can spawn one at that spot of clicking instead of changing items (not often, mostly sandbox)b) The amount of levels is pretty slim but other continents are already laid out for future updatesc) Enemies are slim variety; but as with (b) I'm expecting more as it progresses!Usually these early access games can cost you an arm and a leg but this one is pretty dirt cheap in comparison and is a ton of fun. If you reaaally don't want to scringe on $7ish and you ever see it on sale, you go buy the crap out of it.I'm expecting great things from this game; hopefully workshop compatibility, more items/enemies, gamemodes. I don't think I can stress this enough though, this is early access so its missing alot yes, there are a few minor problems yes, but is this still a great game currently? yes.I thoroughly am enjoying this game. 9.5/10			"

A rewarding feeling is always there as the player uses their own imagination to create wacky, or serious, siege crafts to alter their gameplay on how they wish to conquer the world.I chose this or a salad for lunch.

""Besiege"" ReviewBesiege is a fantastic sandbox build it-and-break it game that should be an integral part of everyone's library. As one of my personal picks, I'd easily recommend it to anyone. Objective In Besiege, you must create vehicles and weapons to conquer various zones and regions. This includes killing soldiers and sheep, breaking down citadel walls, and crushing obstacles. You have the freedom to add huge weaponized structures, propellers, armor, wheels, and more to absolutely anything you can think of. You can save and load anything from your previous creations or from workshop creations, as long as it fits in a certain size box in order to progress to the next level. Levels are fairly simple, but with the countless ways to build, the most important aspect is not just completing objectives. Audio, Graphics, and Performance I would recommend running Besiege on at least a GTX 750Ti or AMD equivalent, as it is very graphics-intensive on the best settings. There are weather and wind effects which are fairly taxing on your system. On a laptop, the game ran pretty hot, but on a GTX 860M it did run well. On Intel Integrated Graphics, expect a range from 5-25 fps. It looks phenomenal, and fire/water have very nice particle effects. Value 7 bucks for a Early Access game with very regular updates, huge amounts of workshop content, and a very supportive community behind it... wait, 7 bucks? This game is a must buy. Absolute must buy. Despite the name and how it may insinuate some undesirable copycat rpg, it's not. It's Minecraft on steroids, it's Blockstorm on crack. Besiege, although it is in Early Access and has limited story mode content, has a sandbox mode which will undoubtedly provide every user hours of gameplay beyond any form of organized content it can provide. With the aforementioned workshop content, you can install mods, custom vehicles, even community concepts from movies.AspectRatingOriginality10Graphics10+Audio10Value10Overall10 Final Points on the Game An absolutely stunning graphics engine, phenomenal sound effects, and a new take on build 'n' smash makes Besiege one of my personal picks.Be sure to check out any of my other reviews on my profile, and please upvote if this helped you, I hope it did!

Early Access Review
								Excellent game, especially for the current price (7 USD), though once they add more levels, it'd easily be worth double that. Though at the time of writing this review, the game does suffer from some minor problems due to it being early access. The game itself is fun, engaging, and challanging. It's a unique experience at full of replayability.The objectives are simple enough. Currently you will either be asked to destroy something, move something, or go to something. The levels are also simple and clean, much like the (very attractive, though still simple) graphics. In fact, the entire game is only about 100 megs, which for a full 3d game with this much dynamic content, says a lot about how much the developer(s) care about keeping it efficient. The interface is a little bit more complicated, but only because of the inherint complexity of building things.And this is where the game really shines, with building things. There are only about 40 parts, at a guess, but with them you can build pretty much anything you set your mind to, so long as you aren't too ridiculous. Catapults and go-carts are only the tip of the iceburg. Build a machine gun! A helicopter! A transformer! The only limit is your imagination and you mechanical prowess. After beating all the currently available levels (about 15, at another guess), I had the urge to go play them again, but differently, and possibly with self-imposed challanges like 'no wheels'. I doubt that the game will give you hundreds of hours of playtime, but it will deliver nigh-unrivaled entertainment (and potentially, challange!) in a much more compact package than most games these days. The only real problem I can see someone having is if they are extremely impatient and easily frustrated. A friend of mine who is a little impatient enjoys the game, but if you're the type who mashes buttons and yells at your computer, well, we don't need you, but you're probably on a console anyway.

The only real reason to buy this game is for it's sandbox mode. Honestly though, if you're not super creative you shouldn't buy this game. I wish the devs would put more focus into finishing the other islands. I really don't see this game EVER coming out of early access. I wouldn't really recommend this game other than to a few of my personal friends. That being said, if you think of yourself as creative and enjoy making little gizmos, I would recommend this game for you. If you were never good at roller coaster tycoon, you probably wont be good at besiege.			"

								Percival stood up once more, sweat-soaked armor clanking. He looked around the battlefield, saw the mangled bodies of his dying comrades whose screams filled the air and whose blood soaked into the earth. His sword, which his father had given to him when he left the farm to fight in the service of the Queen, lay shattered in the dust. He looked straight ahead, where he saw the single thing that had shed so much blood: The Machine of A Thousand Blades. It slowly turned and faced Percival, as if it was some foul beast that had caught wind of his scent. Its wheels creaked and groaned as it began to bear down on this sole survivor.Percival gasped, and picked up a bow from a fallen comrade. He nocked a single arrow towards this horrendous behemoth of war. His only hope was to find some sort of weak spot in the massive wall of iron that protected the monstrosity. Already mounds of blunted arrows lay cast all over the battlefield, fired by archers who had failed at the very thing Percival was attempting to do. It came now, closer. A bead of sweat fell to the ground from his forehead. He spared a thought for Gwendolyn: about what their life might have been like had he not been drafted. The machine was in range. He could wait no longer. He breathed in and fired. Would it hit its mark? Could anyone stop this great war machine? Would Percival live to see his farm again?lol no. He was sliced in half by a circular saw. 10/10			"

								13 / 10, would mechanically eviscerate an artful creation in a terrifying, uncontrollable trundle, ending in a deafening blast again.  Actually, right now.Why haven't you bought this game yet?!  It's like all the violence you always wanted out of your lego/erector kit, with none of the ""What happened to the neighbors' RV and where is the lawnmower??""awkwardness.  Sorry, dad, I was actually aiming for the boat.This is not a physical /simulation/ in the strictest sense, but I sure have burned and bombed and flown and driven and chopped and sliced and dropped and spun quite enough to be duly impressed with the engine.  Looking forward to the Unity 5 build!PROS!- Blow stuff up!- Drive over your enemies.- Slice through your enemies.- Whirr violently.- Crash and die in a fireball of glory from oversteering.- Flexibility and control, like Lego and ErectorCONS?- Your imagination might not be awesome enough.  Start besieging and give it a workout!- Blow yourself up!  Over and over and over!  (may not be an actual con)- Early access, which is also not necessarily a con, just a warning that if you want to 'beat' the official content part of the game, it won't take too long.  But that's not why you're here, is it?  No, you're here for glory and blood, and likes and votes on your favorite online community.PROSEA couple details I've noticed - stacking motorized wheels in the same rotational direction compounds rotational velocity, and this is great fun for creating massive lift in a high-speed rotating wing.  If you're building a quad copter with proper rotors (vice the tiny flying screws), flip the opposite corner wheels and blades - the torsion in one direction from the NE/SW pair will offset that of the NW/SE pair and provide tons of lift for massive cargo capacity with a gentle lilt for airborne control.  And you can easily get enough kit into the legal bounding box to build a total Ipsilon conquerer.Remember, every action has an equal and opposite reaction, more or less.  That thing you're spinning is pushing forward against the mass to which is attached, which is likewise pulling backward, y'know, relatively.  Don't forget your swivel joints, and try not to rip yourself a new axle.Get used to using a keyboard!  Every control is assignable - imagine doing all these things: releasing bombs, firing cannons, moving forward/back/up/down/left/right, igniting/extinguishing flamethrowers, pulling springs, turning gears, steering, flapping, et cetera ad infinitum.  Now imagine doing them all in multiple sets.  Yeah, you're going to need all of the 101+ on that keyboard for your ulimate besiegery monster.I look forward to a standardized best-practice sort of control scheme from the community, similar to the WASD standard nowadays.My wishlist -Fluid dynamics - air, water, and fuel, with related containers, pumps, dispersion... volatility [daisy cutter, anyone?]Micro- and mega- parts, or adjustable (stepped) scale for existing parts.Use the standard bounding box for 'normal' difficulty, but add a larger size for 'medium' and larger still for 'easy', which would still allow level advancement (but forfeit street cred, you lamer).  Or a smaller box for 'hardcore' difficulty.Paint, Colors, Decals!The moon and low gravity glory!I'm off now, to test out an idea with some sliders and create a proper DoomTrain.			"

								This is great for people that like to build great machines but are too poor to go to engineering school or buy lots of legos (megablocks ARE NOT the same). There's also missions and 2 sandboxes to choose from. All in all, it's perfect for when you want to destory a castle with a bomber or cannon truck without going to prison.+It's like $8+Only needs 2gb of RAM+Workshop access+A lot of different parts-Slows down a bit when making complex machines-Updates to content is a little slow-Catapult building is rough when the pieces snap instead of bend-Killed myself a few time with fire(you are always flammable)-Singleplayer onlyBuy it though, for real			"

Early Access Review
								When speaking of an Early Access title on Steam it is important to note that development is not yet done.  Any comments here about bugs and design issues may have been corrected in an update after this Review has been posted.  Please consider the posting date before using this as a gauge on the quality of the title being looked at.A physics-based sandbox wherein users are encouraged to create their own war machines using a series of simple mechanical devices; Spiderling Studios' Besiege lets users' creativity run wild with how to be the most destructive and does so beautifully.While Early Access and Kickstarter began as a way for users to help shape the future of games it has quickly degraded into a way for developers to get a quick cash-in that leaves half-baked messes in end-users' laps.  Titles like Double Fine's Spacebase DF-9 and Broken Age are examples of how to take people's money and give them less than what they paid for in return.  Developers like Double Fine abandon games like Spacebase DF-9 only half completed and missing all the promised depth and challenge.  Besiege, by having promised little more than the ability to make your favourite doomsday device and giving a great deal of mechanics that users can use in any way, has already surpassed my expectations wildly.At this stage in development Besiege has two game modes: Sandbox and Campaign.  Sandbox sets the player in a space filled with many things to destroy and interact with but no explicit goal.  Campaign however sets the player in a much smaller field with the need to build their war machine to fulfill a specific goal.  Players can be tasked with destroying a castle or village, navigating a minefield to reach a specific point, killing an army, or several things at once.Just as with Garry's Mod or the Kerbal Space Program, Besiege gives players the ability to do whatever they want and rewards them with an entertaining if not always expected result.  The Internet is already filled with screenshots by more creative users that show off flying cities, walking automatons, and dune buggies.  The limits of ones imagination are really the biggest thing in a player's way.Spinning bladed death platforms like in the BBC's Robot Wars television series are easy to make, sending streams of blood everywhere as soldiers are rend limb from virtual limb.  You can make ornithopters, helicopters, blimps - it is truly a wonder to find yourself creating a machine to drop a series of flamethrowing platforms on people.Graphically Besiege takes a light, cartoonish feel while at the same time providing pools, spurts, splashes and mists of blood when killing enemies and innocents via the games many weapons.  Fire and explosion effects give a pseudo-realistic spread and additional destruction that can help and hurt the player's plans.And then there is the physics.  Besiege's physics take my not entirely useless PC and make it grind to a halt at times.  The more complex you build your war machine, the slower the results will play out.  This of course will be improved by the team at Spiderling Studios as the game continues to grow and take shape, but it can be quite annoying now when you make your bomber rise into the air to drop its payload of flaming bombs and time begins to slow.Developers are presently looking to refine their physics and add more weapons and mechanics in addition to completing upcoming game modes like the heretofore mysterious Moon, which Spiderling Studios have yet to give concrete details on, but may end up with new physics and enemies to play with.  And where the current campaign mode is just a single continent they are working on an additional four campaigns in order to progress to global domination, and it would be great if with these new continents came new art styles and enemy behaviour.  Where the current continent campaign of Ipsilon is strictly European, perhaps Phi will end up Chinese, Persian, or Indian.  And it would be a nice way to spice up the game were the dev team to introduce a map maker and integrate Steam Workshop for sharing of challenges.  There is a world of potential that Spiderling can bring to the game.Even as a staunch opponent of Pre-ordering and Early Access purchases - by promising little and giving users a great many ways to do it Besiege has won me over.  If you want a quick laugh as you accidentally blow yourself up, or a challenging interactive puzzle game, you will not be disappointed with this Early Access title.  At 7 dollars, this game is a steal for any creative-types out there.			"

								I don't ususally write reviews, but I made an exception for this game.Besiege is a Sandbox/Puzzle/Build game where the player's objective is to utterly annihilate enemy structures and armies using their own monstrous machine of destruction. The game features realistic physics, fantastic user interfaces and simple control schemes to assist in the player's creativity. I haven't played much, but I got hooked the moment I started. I also haven't encountered any glitches or bugs, a rare situation among early access games. The game feels and plays fluidly, not to mention, it looks fantastic. Even though I've only played a few hours, I've created several tanks, catapults and explosives within that time span.10/10 Would recommend. Totally worth the cost. I can't wait to see what features will be implemented in future releases of the game.			"

								I super, super much recommend Besiege but let's start with obvious disclaimers anyway: Besiege is still early access. I sometimes see people forgetting this and getting stupidly angry. Don't expect a finished product when you buy early access title.Now with that out of the way, Besiege is my favourite building game ever. I remember seeing some gifs of some early creations many years ago, drooling in envy because I thought I could never do something like that. Then I started playing and the (completely optional) campaign missions did a good job coaching me to try new things and I am constantly coming up with new ideas of what to do.Especially with some (easy-to-install) mods that expand the available building tools Besiege becomes a really powerful and fun physics toy.Only limit on your creativity is your available CPU power, and that is one part where the early access shows. Bigger creations can get quite heavy on your machine and with my medium-range CPU I need to restrict some of my craziest ambitions. That is a bummer, but hopefully it will be fixed in the future, and nevertheless I am having tons of good time with Besiege as it is.			"

								+ Great art style+ Great music and ambience+ Good mini campaign available at the moment, more coming+ Lots of different parts, weapons and gear, new added in every update+ SANDBOX!+ If you like it, blood! (can be turned off)+ Your creativity is pretty much the limit+ Runs well even in not really powerfull PC's (turning all graphic options off)+ Just 100 MB to download at the momentCons:- If you don't have a really powerfull computer, creating a large machine will result in a big fps drop. All is fine in the build mode, but as soon as the game starts emulating physics, it can get ugly.This has been one of the greatest games someone ever gifted me, great early access and price/quality relation.You can play from 20 mins to 5 hours, it doesn't matter, and you will still have fun.If you know about physics and design, the game might be easy for you, however, if you are like the vast majority of us you will probably create massive moving.... things at first with 30 cannons and flamethrowers attached to it.It moves! and looks deadly! You will be very proud of it until you fire the cannons and everything turns to shreds.But practice makes perfect!After some hours of playing I could create a reloadable trebuchet with two spare bombs, 8 cannons, two flame throwers, two wheel-blades, two saw blades at the back, and it can convert into battering ram through the power of pistons and a detachable metal spike ball and springs....They are doing minor updates every 2-3 weeks (blocks, bug fixes, minor features) and major updates (world parts, campaign, major changes) every 2-3 months.If you like creating things and have a good laugh at comical failure, buy this.No, really.Buy it.

								So far in early access it's a fun little game. Have been gaming casually lately and I find this one pretty relaxing. The physics are probably the best part, along with tools to make just about anything. Siege carts, tanks, trebuchets, flying machines.. the possibilites are endless depending on your creativity and knowledge of the mechanics. Barely had to read any tutorial because the UI is so clean and laid out nicely. I feel like I understand how pretty much all of the tools work already. If you're into physics games, or mechanically inclined I say definitely check this game out!			"

								A lot of people including myself have been burned by some early access game, so naturally I was a little sketical about purchasing it. I can't resist the demolition and bridge builder style of flash games, so I really couldn't help but get it. For $7.79 it's hard to say no anyways.The game on a whole is very slick. The graphics are very smooth and easy on the eyes, minimalistic. but in such a way that looks very proffesional. The pictures on the store page look cinematic, something you wouldn't expect to find in the game, but it's almost the exact same in game, no added filters to glam it up, the game really does look good. You won't find pictures of it, but the in game menus are stunning, really clean and incredibly proffesional looking.The gameplay is absurdly fun. You can do pretty much whatever you like and beat the level a hundred different ways. In one of the first levels you destory a small building. You can destory it with a few blocks and some wheels. Or you can create a trebuchet with 78 Cannons attached and 37 flame throwers. If that doesn't tickle your fancy you can make an plane loaded with half a dozen massive bombs and drop them over the tiny house, or just fly right into it.Tonnes of fun, you can easily spend half an hour building just one machine.Pros:-Cheap-Good graphics-Really fun-Good for a quick game-Good for long game-Can play a level over and over-Minimal bugsCons:-Not much for levels right now-Controls can sometimes feel a little weird-Could use a bit more variety in blocks-Still has some bugs (expected, usually hilarious)Overall, for an early access game, 9/10Compared to most early access, 11/10.There seems to be a lot of stuff on the way, and a lot of it is also there as ""Coming soon"", so you can get idea of what is to come as well (like playing on the moon).

								Besiege is an early access, simulation game from Spiderling Studios. Let’s get rocking.The GoodHave you ever wanted to create gigantic machines with the sole purposes of wreaking havoc, taking life, and racking up an outrageous amount of property damage? Did you answer yes? If, so, you should probably get some help…or just get Besiege and live out those homicidal fantasies of yours in the game.If you can dream it, you can build it. Granted, your dreams will be limited by the amount of materials given to you in the game for use in the construction of aforementioned death machines, but, if you take a look at the Steam Workshop, you’ll see that there isn’t much of a limit as to what you can build here.Once you get the hang of how things work, you’ll find yourself spending in inordinate amount of time playing this game. It’s a solid time killer and quite a lot of fun.The BadThe font in the game is incredibly small. Maybe that’s just at my resolution, but I don’t know.The MehSometimes the physics in the game don’t work like you’d expect physics to work in real life. It doesn’t come up often, but it does come up.It’s still in early access, so, there’s not much to do besides a short “campaign” and messing around in the sandbox.Verdict: YeaIf you have a deep love for both creation and destruction and you can’t keep those voices quiet in your head, this just might be the game for you. Seriously though, it’s a fun game and if you have the cash, you shouldn’t hesitate to add it to your collection.			"

								Its not expensive and fun to play. I hope they will add longer maps and a highscore function though. You can build very creatively but you dont have a long range map to test your creations limit. Often my throwing creations projectile hits the invisible wall. Maybe add a driving range of sorts? 10 hours in I feel pretty done with this game till a new content release comes. Though jumping in and watching your bombs rip everything to pieces in slomotion now and then is the bom-diggity!Ive personally made:-Catapults-Trebuchets-118 cannon artillery-Bombs-A claymore mine sort of thing-Balistas-Weird veichles-Bad aerial machines (this♥♥♥♥♥♥is hard)-Lifting contraptions (cranes and such)-Weird things that dont have a name like the ""Jumping murder cube of springs"" and the ""Makeshift gun of selfdestruction"")My point is you can already make alot of things and this game IS worth 7 eur. Even in alpha. Fun for the creative mind.			"

								This game, its pretty amazing in my opinion, although camera control can sometimes be a pain and weighting out my constructs that fly is a nightmare to get the balancing right, it's all worth it in the end, this game takes a amount of skill to build advanced constructs with much more than the average ones built by the mediocre player, it takes time and a little heart to build these machines, but I do like this game, the handlings smooth, we get updates here and there which keep me interested in it, sadly I wish I could say totally interested but I don't try to invest my time on to many games :P , but yeah in all honesty if you can run it, get it, its an awesome game...

								This game can be fun for absolutely anyone (novice or experienced), and this title, I have to say, is pretty much the first of its kind.Let's say that you've just started the game. I remember that when I saw my first machine spring to life and crush the tiny house (which is the desired goal of the first level) I instantly smiled and wanted to play more.As the levels got more and more challenging, they required more enginuity. Even though it may take a lot longer to build multiple different potentially successful machines to build the level, the satisfaction of beating each one, and learning as you go, is still the same.This is why I say that it works for anyone: skilled engineers can fiddle with various parts and learn more about the game's mechanics, whilst novice vehicle-constructors can enjoy how easy it is to learn without being taught at all. My tip: always experiment with various mechanical items and see what they do. You might just find a new edge to beat the level!			"

								Worth every penny.I've had a lot of fun playing this, and I cannot wait to see what else they will add throughout development.If you're one of those people who (smartly) avoids early access, this title already has quite a lot of content for the price they're offering. So it's worth it.The only complaint from me is it is sometimes difficult to achieve some missions. I like to try to build complex machines but ultimately they fail horribly, which can be tedious sometimes. But that's my own fault, not the developers.Pros: Great physics Beautiful art style Decent soundtrack Playground for creative mindsCons:None! "

Its normaly a building game that you have to destroy stuff but when you turn cheats on it becomes like sandbox. I absolutely love the cheats and its a really fun game. It will get challenging futher through the story and flying is kinda hard (for me atleast :P) and building things like tanks, planes, helicopters, motercycles, cars, trucks and way more crazy things like a metal gear and a transformer (yes it is possible to make one). I definately would recomend this game.			"

								This game is an example of early access done right - reasonable pricetag, tons of replayability, endless discovery and configurations of siege engines. The one thing I have an issue with is my 36 cannon masterpiece lags the game. is it because two rows of 12 are on pistons? This is an insanely fun toy to play with. You get about 15 levels to mess around with, and a sandbox mode. Lots of options, great building system, and hilarious antics are guaranteed. You will definnitely laugh out loud many times.

Early Access Review
								Besiege isn't really a BAD game. What's there is actually very solid, especially for an Early Access game. The visuals are beautiful, the gameplay is entertaining and well put together, and the whole thing is all quite fun............for about 5 minutes.You see, Besiege's biggest problem is that, well, there's just not a whole lot to do. Thanks to this being an Early Access game, there are only about 20 levels or so in the main ""story"" mode, with the devs promising to add more later on.Almost all of these levels revolve around destroying something, with occasional breaks to grab something and deliver it somewhere, or get to a certain point in the map or whatever. While entertaning at first, these levels quickly become repetitive (at least for me) and lose their charm after the first few stages. You can go to the sandbox and screw around with making ridiculous, absurd contraptions, but this also gets very dull very quickly.Bottom line:    Besiege has all the trappings of a fantastic game. It is just brimming with potential, and IF the devs stick with it, it could become something truly special. For now, though, Besiege just doesn't have enough content. I would recommend waiting until they finish the game before you decide to buy it.*EDIT*Since this is an Early Access game, it is always updating and adding new content. Thus, as more and more stuff is added, this review becomes more and more outdated.However, I believe that my message still stands. Be wary and be smart. Besiege is simply too lacking in things to do at this point, and that will certainly change over time.Once (or if) the game exits Early Access, I will re-review it. I'm sure that by that point it will be pretty awesome.			"

								I absolutely love this game to death, as it is fun, and so creative for a kid like me with a huge imagination.It does have just a few downsides...1. The lag.The lag is a problem due to many entities moving at once. This is not the greatest for low-end computers. I have a computer with 6GB of RAM and a 1GB GPU, and an iMac with 4GB of RAM and a 128MB GPU. They both run the game fine with small items, but builds with around 100+ blocks lag the computer and start decreasing the framerate dramatically. I would recommend a non-attatched entity remover built into the game. Cannonballs are an example for this. With one of the newer updates, we were intoduced to the Infinite Ammo option, allowing you to spam cannons. There are so many cannonballs not removed that it will start lagging the system trying to calculate all of those entities.2. ControlsDon't get me wrong, but the controls are fine, but in some ways, they are sorta on the ""eh"" side. Placing braces or blocks are an example. The game will make it move to an undesired location, making you have to remove the block. (That's pretty much it for this.)3. Semi-glitchy GameplayThe gameplay is amazing, and sometimes, the glitches are funny as hell, but shaking is something most of us with 30+ hours in the game have noticed. I have made creations that are amazing, and out of nowhere, it will start shaking insanely and throw the entire creation into pieces. I don't know why it happens, but it will need to be fixed in the future. It can get really annoying. Another way of glitching in Besiege is some blocks get caught on other blocks. I have only experienced this a few times, and it isn't that big of a deal, but when you are trying to fling a bomb at a tower and it explodes in your face, that can be a problem.Anyway, this is just a review in the Early Access time. In future updates, everything will more than likely be fixed. This is NOT to turn away people from buying this game, as it is an absolute rollercoaster of creativity at your fingertips. I would HIGHLY recommend this game for anyone with an extremely creative mind, such as myself.10/10. I will play this game until the end of time.			"

								I have this game almost since beginning. Its a lot of fun and i really really like it. its also alot of fun to build awesome or just plain dumb but working machines to solve the level. This game is a good example for ""if its stupid but works, it aint stupid"".  I won a lot of levels by building a catapult or some spinning machine of death... or just 3 blocks and 2 wheels. Sadly, very sadly the progress is very slow... i just played it again after a long time (a year or so) and there is almost nothing new. A level editor would be cool.

								Besiege is like a wonky♥♥♥♥♥version of Kerbal Space Program set in the dark ages. You will build many many contraptions of varying utility, most of which will immediately fall apart/spazz out/spontaneously combust upon use. There's only a few maps available at this point, and the phsyics are awesome in a laughably inconsistent kind of way. Still, there's plenty of promise here, and even more importantly, a bus-sized catapult amount of fun. It's totally worth the $7 currently asked by the developers, and anyone even remotely interested in building stuff that breaks other stuff should press ""add to cart"" without hesitation. I rate it as trebuchet/catapult - would definitely spontaneously combust again.			"

								Great way to confront your creative ideas with a little bit dose of reality, and then use whatever it is you've created to cause mayhem, destruction, and chaos.Seriously, I would never think that building a weak♥♥♥♥♥trebuchet for half an hour would be so demanding, yet so satisfying. I shed a single tear while watching a tower ending its' miserable life after meeting with it. And it can be much better than this.			"

								Besiege is one of my favorite games. It requires a lot of creativity and imagination. The game is very simple, yet very complex, as there are simple things like pistons, but with a unique mind, you could use them to create something like a rapid-firing cannon!  What I really love though, is that it costs way less than its worth. So if you enjoy sandbox, building, or strategy games like me, Besiege is something to consider.			"

								Its a very fun game that has endless possibilites. You start out with the campaign, but then branch out to the sandbox to create even better designs. If you get stuck on the campaign like me you can just play around in the sandbox  or redo levels with overly complicated machines, which is totally fine. I recommend this game to anyone.			"

								 An good game for building stuff. This game has an excelent UI and the best physics engine I have ever seen (when it is working), Watching your creation blow up in 1% slow motion is a highlight.pros- UI, physics, graphics, missions, offline capability, and mods.cons-short singleplayer campaign (not yet complete), no ropes(like in ME) only winches, mods are not on workshop, some levels are not cpu friendly. in short, and excelent building game DEFINETLY worth the price.

								I've been playing this game since it released on early access and i find it alot of fun, sure the levels are lackluster and sorta repetitive but i came for the sandbox and fin that just downloading machines off the workshop and getting a few fun mods off of the forums makes the game have alot more playability. (i dont really care about the campaign) 9/10 would buy again.dont recommend building something over 1000 blocks or your pc kills itself			"

								Although the game is currently developing by just 2 guys, it already has great performance. The art style of this game are the ones that I prefered most.(Thats why it caught my eyes before it was released.) The game, as we all know, it's still in alpha but it is definitely playable. Inside the game, the first land is opened for players, and the rest are ""Under Construction"". Also, there is a ""Sandbox Mode"" already in game. Players can build and test their own designs.Overall, it's a nice and clean game. Looking forward to see more gameplay mechanics, constructible parts and weapons!			"

								Find an obvious solution. Then actually solve the puzzle in half a dozen obviously not intended ways, each more hilarious than the last. The more incidental explosions the better.In a genre that depressingly often boils down to ""guess what the developer was thinking"" this game is the outstanding exception. It's not finished yet, but 90% of players already won't use most of the large toolbox it offers.			"

								Not a bad game at all. Not going in my play everyday file, but it is engrossing. It is entertaining. It is hairpulling.. :-p Start with a blank brain for any ideas. You see a structure before you.. you have access to all the building blocks. Now figure out how they work, and create to destroy that structure. Sound like a cheating Godmode? Nope. For a few reasons. Initially you have no idea what exactly the parts do and how they do it together. Learning curve. Second. As you progress the enemy does also. Little infantrymen, archers, stone castles.. and even things that challenge beyond that. Bombs and tanktraps.. even floating places that require aviation ( I ve not gotten there yet )Think of it like SE meets ME minus any survival resouce gathering and not doing it cheating or in an edit mode.. because the challenges make up for the other bits. Now, if your a wiz at engineering, or at understanding how to design aircraft out of bubblegum and a few sticks.. your probably not going to be as entertained.. but for a zero engineering mind like me.. its great!!! The really really good building types are putting out workshop items that defy belief. M1A1 tanks.. jets..  its fascinating... me.. I am still trying to figure out how to make a catapult work. At least I figured out a gravity drop crushing ball.. :-p			"

								This game probably gets the game of the year award for me.If I was to explain what this game is in a phrase, it would be:Lego for PC but for real men.Positives:+ Great community (A huge plus even though this game has loads of content already)+ Great community creations (You even got a f*king dat boi machine)+ Moddability (Easy to mod)+ Great PC performance (All my systems, even the potato ones could run this well)+ Infinite Possibilities (Lots of mechanics and items to choose from)+ Advanced Physics (Challenging but not impossible for the casuals to overcome)+ Quality Textures (Well made textures in the vanilla version. Mods too have great downloadable textures)+ No unlocks (Thank god)+ No IAPs (Because f*ck IAPs)+ Cheap price (No IAPs yet with a great price tag????)+ Honest developers (They seem to be truthful and explain things in detail)+ Lots of content (Just check the workshop yourself)+ Natural Marketing (This game has little to no marketing but has captured so much ground on reddit and other gaming forums. You don't wanna miss out don't you ;P )Negatives:- Tutorial seems lacking for this game (This can be a good thing though as it forces you to explore the game)- The DOF is so annoying (Able to turn it off)Just buy the damn game already while I find more ways to kill and destory.

								BesiegeAbsolutely brilliant game! This is one of my favourite games in steam for sure. There is nothing like this in steam right now, it's different in many ways compared other games similar to this, one of those things is being the best.It's a very strategic game with some elements of anger when you can not get past levels. Highly recommended. If you enjoy making puzzles and challenging yourself, this is deffinnedly a must have for you! Levels are not too hard but not too easy to complete. Ofc this depends how good you are, but it's from my perspective.This game has so much blocks etc in it, you will spend some thime trying to understant what they all do, but you will learn them pretty easily. The community also offers a lot of guides and tips to help other players, that is also a big plus for this game. You can also download some cool vehicles that other people have made and belive me when I say this: there are a lot of pretty interesting and cool things that you can download.  There's a very nicely done campaign with many and many levels. There is many ""islands"" as I like to call them that have the levels to play trough. This game has allready good amount of levels and in the future there will be lot more to come. There is also a ""moon"" which sounds extremely great! Overall, brilliant game with great physics and a beautiful style that only this has! My grade for this game 9/10			"

Only complaint right now are the camera controls that isn't as nice as I'd like it to be. *Edit: Found Middle Mouse. EVERYTHING IS BETTER!!But I personally don't care when I can add cannons to ALLL the space!!!However, ithere's only a few levels  at the moment and while already well worth the money you'll pay for this, there's not much into it yet unless you're one for experimentation and such. If you're the type to go for objectives and goals rather than experimenting with the myriad of weapons you can make then I suggest to wait until more levels have been made.			"

I can't stress enough how rewarding it is to build a giant contraption of mayhem and have it work and complete your goal of total annihalation!

YouTube™ Video: Besiege: Creative Destruction 

			Views: 195		

			Today I check out Besiege from Spiderling Studios. This is a cool physics based building game with some puzzle elements. I'm in love! Leave a like if you enjoyed and subscribe for more content.		

Besiege is a beautiful blend of pyshics and puzzle elements in one simple formula. At first you build relatively simple siege engines to solve most problems. Eventually however you begin to try more and more things. For the amount of items you can use to create your weapons of destruction its astonishing what you can create. When I bought this game I lost all my spare time over a weekend. Loved every second! Can not wait for even more parts to play with.			"

								Designing your own catapults and siege cars, and then wrecking castles with them, is incredibly fun. The only limiting factor on this game is your own creativity. The best thing about this game is creating obscure and ridiculous designs to complete each level.+ Intuitive controls+ Diverse and creative levels+ Appealing minimalistic design+ Generous pricing+ Smooth and fast gameplay+ Great visual style+ Has a 'sandbox' mode+ Get to kill sheep- Can't rewrite the camera keymaps.

								An amazing physics-based game.In Besiege, you'll take the role of a medieval war engineer. You will have to build different siege machines responding to the testing situations the game offers. Its artstyle and simplistic design may make you think it's an easy game. And you're going to be wrong. Because your first creation, that you'll be proud of, will probably crumble after you fire the first cannon.Improve your engineering skills, conquer the 2 available continents and build the ultimate siege machine!Being already a very good game, its designers update it to add new levels to challenge even the best siege machine designers out there. In addition, there's a sandbox map to test your creations. So it can only get better.It's a 10/10.			"

								Besiege is one of the most intellectually stimulating game I've ever played. It's blood lust meets engineering in the sexiest of ways.The player is given a goal of destroying a certain portion of the buildings/troops/etc on the field for each level. Inside of a certain buildable area, the player uses a vast toolbox of parts, pieces and mecahnisms to build machines able to detroy the necessary targets. You can roll over them, fly over them, bomb or burn them - your imagination is the limit. Machines can be saved and loaded, taken from or added to so you don't have to remember that one design you used to beat that one level.I highly recommend this game.			"

								For an alpha it is already VERY solid. I suspect it is only described as such because of a lack of content. What you will recieve for your small and fair sum is a Siege Engine builder with a rewarding difficulty curve. Take time to discover what each item does and find the most devious ways to use, nay UNLEASH it/them on your poor unsuspecting foes.Whilst the aforementioned lack of content means you may well dispatch the level available in a few hours the old adage 'There is more than one way to skin a cat' will continuously drag you back to design a killing machine bigger/better/crueller than the last.Definitley recommended.

								Great Game. Very simple controls and building, but you can do a lot with what it gives you. I was really impressed with the different interactions between the parts, There are a ton of different ways to approach each mission, and comparing and contrasting methods with my friends is the best part. I can't wait for more levels. Some things i would like to see for the future with this game:1. A Map Editor.  This would increase the life of the game indefinitely, because you could download and share maps. A good Map Editor would be amazing.2. Multiplayer. Either in sandbox mode or the above mentioned map editor if that's possilbe. Being able to load in multiple different machines would add a lot to the game. You could have races,  dog fights, tank fights, or anything. That would be the difference between a game that you can put 40 or 50 hours into and a game that you can put 300 hours into. That being said, even without those features this game is great and I highly recommend it.			"

								Really love the possibilities of what you can build, and the variation of things you can use to make stuff. It's one of those games that you spend an hour on, but realize it's been 3 hours, it's just so entertaining. Levels have a lot of variation and are pretty satisfying to complete. The graphics are very appealing and have a nice mixture of cartoon and reaistic looking stuff. The physics is generally pretty top notch, although it's a bit glitchy at times, but what game isn't? It would be nice if the collision on objects could just be touched up a bit, but it's really no big deal, barely effects the majority of gameplay. Looking forward to future updates for more levels and stuff.OVERALL: I'd give it a 7/10 right now, but it looks like that's going to eventually be a 10 in future updates, considering the most recent one was so good. GOOD JOB GUYS THANKS FOR MAKING THIS IT'S FUN BYE.			"

								An incredible creativity tool that combines the simplicity of a child's building blocks with a deep complexity that can mean all the difference between ""I made a box with wheels"" and ""I made a functioning replica V-22 Osprey complete with armaments.""There are a few physics bugs that come up from time to time, particularly with braces. but they are minor and easy to compensate for. Some clever players have even found a way to use these bugs to their advantage (see the water cannon scramjets for a great example). I wish the sandbox mode map was bigger to accomodate fast vehicles, and I would like to see building angles smaller than 90 degrees as a default feature rather than one which needs to be modded in, but these things rarely present enough of an issue to bother me. Get this game. If you are at all mechanically inclined and like to build things, it's absolutely worth the money.			"

								By Zeus' beard! This game is totally amazing! Build killing machines with a super simple interface and let loose on high resolution buildings and enemies. Awesome! The absolute best thing about this game is the silky smooth user interface. There is zero complications in building the killing machine of your dreams! And the physics and fire effects are impressive enough to add another layer of strategy. The game still needs to be fleshed out with more levels. I think it could use a sandbox mode and maybe a level editor, too. My only gripe is that these are some parts that I still don't know how to use. I don't know if the game will walk me through their use down the line (some levels emphasize certain parts) but a dedicated tutorial would be nice.			"

								With Kerbal Space Program leaving Early Access I found myself in a bit of a slump. I mean, to me, KSP was the only game which I felt good recommending steam's ""Buy Unfinished Games"" program for. Filled with thousands of empty promises, and even more zombie survival games, the service just feels like it exhibits the worst of game development. And then along comes Besiege; a beautifully polished physics sandbox game with a fantastic price and transparent development. This is what early access is all about. I feel better about the service now, and hope this is an example to future developers wanting to use this model. Anyway, it's pretty much digital Lego with pointy bits and explosions ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ "

								This is one of those rare games where trial and error is more entertaining than actually passing the mission. The game's only constraints are the current number of block types available and the bounding lines for your creation (which can be shut off in sandbox mode.)My only complaints for the game (still in alpha atm, of course):Number one is the camera. It's horrible right now, forcing you to look at very odd angles to see something. A problem that is compounded when testing your contraption in combat. You can't zoom in on a certain point, but rather at the center point of the creation box.The game can quickly bog down your computer on some levels, the framerate plummeting as an entire group of soldiers goes from alive to blood smear without the in-between animation.The music, minor but still an issue, quickly gets annoying. It sounds like ""No Particular Place To Go"" and I can only take so much Chuck Berry when the same two lines of a song play through my head as I'm trying to kill. I'm sure it's just me and shows I'm only nitpicking as the mute button works just as well on here as it does on ads.One thing that is worth noting is the lack of a tutorial. This game is fine with starting you out with nothing as the first few missions are only testing beds and have no risk but challenge you to add onto your initial creations. But a tutorial for basic designs (or starting with a few simple designs) would have been helpful. Learning what use a few blocks have or how to make the most of other blocks would be useful as well. Otherwise, there's always youtube and the trial and error process.The graphics are wildly entertaining and makes me feel like I'm tearing through the glass villages my mother used to set up during the winter. Which actually makes it far more satisfying. Your creation has no limits at all to what you want to put on it, BUT keep in mind that weight is a huge part of this physics engine and your ""liberator"" can break apart under its own weight.The only thing I'd say is that in its current state the price is on par for a large game. Meaning you are spending more on this than you would for a phone app of the same content. Worth the price but will only be giving you new stuff for about two hours upon which time you will need to replay missions with impractical contraptions. However, the main menu shows that LOTS of stuff is still planned for the future.			"

								I have seen a lot of Besiege screenshots, clips and gifs of brutal warmachines on the internet lately. I became pretty curious about this game, and thought: Why not? I am not disappointed about my purchase. Time flies by when building these machines. And the interesting thing is: you don't have to build a war machine in every level. Sometimes you just need to build a vehicle to complete a level. You can be creative in the things you build and how you want to complete the levels.And it is not always easy to build a good working machine. Sometimes you find out that the construction is not strong enough and the machine falls apart. Or maybe you find out that you had to use other weapons to destroy something.If you just want to build machines without any limits and see how they work, you can play it in the sandbox mode, which gives you a lot more freedom.The graphics are simple and cartoony, but they still look nice and pretty.  The UI is simple but also very clear. There are also a few tutorials about the very basics, but later you have to find out how you build something. Although this is an Early Access game, I think it is a good one so far. It is not finished yet, they add more building parts in updates.  And there is yet one zone with 16 levels to complete, but here are more to come in the future. And I am looking forward to the new levels to complete.My rating for this game: 8/10.			"

You build siege engines, flying machines, Rube-Goldberg machines, statues that wave, collapse and catch-fire... You solve puzzle by building bizarre machines. You can set sheep on fire, fire spinning blades at ranks of soldiers, drop bombs from airships onto castles below... And it's still got loads more levels and components to come.

								Play this game to feel like the Green Lantern -- your powers of destruction are limited only by your imagination. It's very light on levels still, but then again, the main draw of the game is dreaming up and then implementing your own crazy contraptions. The fact that all the machines are saved in plain text files allows for some advanced designs that wouldn't be possible with the normal editor.More a toy than a traditional story-driven computer game, this one is highly recommended.

								Besiege, Besiege, Besiege.When I first saw this little indie game, I was intrigued. I've always loved building mecanical creations, both in games and with tools (lots of LEGO). So when I picked it up about six months ago (for only $6.00!) I instantly had to try it out.The game (as many people can tell you) is a physics-based sandbox puzzle game. You build things to complete a set objective, and then you fail at it twenty times, tweaking it repeatedly until you get that ""Aha!"" moment, find something that works, and complete the level. At the time of this review, there are about 35 separate levels between two areas, with more on the way. Each level objective varies from stage to stage. Some will just require you to destroy things, while others require more precision, such as the level ""Diom Well"", where you need to get poison barrels into a well.The levels, however, are not the key part of this game. That would be the sandbox area and the ability to build machines of mammoth proportions. In this area, you are given the freedom to build anything you desire, ranging from giant mechs to light aircraft. It was the moment I built a giant trebuchet that made me love this game.Don't get me wrong, this game is NOT perfect. Some of the levels can be quite annoying (""Village of Diom"" can die in a fire for all I care) and the mechanics for flight are very cumbersome.But for its faults, there are plenty of redeeming qualitites that lead me to recommend Besiege to someone-if they have a creative mind. That is the key factor to whether or not you will enjoy this game. If you are not a very creative person...then this is definitely not the game for you. Besiege's levels require someone to think outside of the box to complete them. And any enjoyment of the sandbox solely depends on your creativity.So, yes, I do recommend Besiege. The game is not that expensive at the time of this review ($8.00) so even if you don't like the game it didn't cost that much in the first place. (And refunds exist for a reason...) But this is one game that will stay in my library for years to come.			"

So when I picked it up about six months ago (for only $6.00!) I instantly had to try it out.The game (as many people can tell you) is a physics-based sandbox puzzle game. You build things to complete a set objective, and then you fail at it twenty times, tweaking it repeatedly until you get that ""Aha!"" moment, find something that works, and complete the level. At the time of this review, there are about 35 separate levels between two areas, with more on the way. Each level objective varies from stage to stage. Some will just require you to destroy things, while others require more precision, such as the level ""Diom Well"", where you need to get poison barrels into a well.The levels, however, are not the key part of this game. That would be the sandbox area and the ability to build machines of mammoth proportions. In this area, you are given the freedom to build anything you desire, ranging from giant mechs to light aircraft. It was the moment I built a giant trebuchet that made me love this game.Don't get me wrong, this game is NOT perfect. Some of the levels can be quite annoying (""Village of Diom"" can die in a fire for all I care) and the mechanics for flight are very cumbersome.But for its faults, there are plenty of redeeming qualitites that lead me to recommend Besiege to someone-if they have a creative mind. That is the key factor to whether or not you will enjoy this game. If you are not a very creative person...then this is definitely not the game for you. Besiege's levels require someone to think outside of the box to complete them. And any enjoyment of the sandbox solely depends on your creativity.So, yes, I do recommend Besiege. The game is not that expensive at the time of this review ($8.00) so even if you don't like the game it didn't cost that much in the first place. (And refunds exist for a reason...) But this is one game that will stay in my library for years to come.			"

Early Access Review
								This was the most fun and well made Alpha build of a game I ever played!At first you may go for simple machines to go through the levels and you'll finish the game quite fast... But it's not the ammount of levels that matter in this game! It's the ammount of different machines and creation you can construct to pass those levels!You won't get bored of playing the levels over and over again because they'll never be the same! Today you may build a catapult, tomorrow a hammer, the next day a freaking helicopter!!All I have to say is, for this cheap, this game has more content and stuff to do than many other games out there that cost twice as much or more...Now, I'm no game critic nor am I quite the game connoisseur, but if someone asked me I'd rate the game as follows:Gameplay: 8/10 - because if you don't put some effort and thinking into it, chance is, it'll be a simple and possibly clunky machine.Desgin: 9/10 - Actually I'm not giving a 10/10 because my 10 goes for reallistic graphics, but this is a different realm, and the style is amazing and I wouldn't change it a bit!Level design: 8/10 - They're simple and straight forward. That's the best and the worst of it. I'd like to see some more intricate levels and I'd love to see community made maps (if that hasn't been implemented yet)Community creations: 10/10 - I love games where the community can share their work and this game allows it by letting people use others machines blueprint files, and it's as easy as copy pasta :PAnd believe me, I've seen some amazing creations. They're just incredible!Last, but definetly not least...Fun: 8/10 - You can replay this game over and over again and you'll want to go back to it as soon as you close it!""But why just 8?"", you might ask... Well... As mentioned above, you'll have to put time, effort, and thought into your creations, and TO ME, not being able to be objective in a game, makes it less fun at times - with this I mean I'M LAZY AND I CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO THINK AND BUILD SOMETHING. It's not the game. It's me xDFinal score - 8/10 for all the above reasons.Remember, I'm not a game critic nor connoisseur. I'm just giving you my 2 cents and also remember that your experience and opinions may vary.Lasly, I just want to say that this game is awesome, and you should buy it! It's not expensive AT ALL and you'll be happy to have and play it.			"

								Besiege is an overall awesome game!!! It has a few downsides, like how hard it is to really make a good, stable model, and there is a bit of lag every once in a while (for me) but that's ok. Just like Gary's Mod, there is an awesome workshop where people (who DO know how to build stuff) make crazy, awesome machines that you only have to click a button to get. I you love Gary's Mod, your probably going to love this because it's a simplified, medieval version of it (kind of) I haven't spent too much  time on this game yet, but so far, the diversity of maps, the different game modes, and the awesome stuff you can build will definately not dissapoint you! Thanks for reading guys!! Please thumbs up this review, I'd like formore people to see it :)			"

								ADDITION - PLEASE READI figured out well not so much figured.. let's say found out that those 2 annoyances below was not actually the game and for some reason was one of the many quirky flaws with windows 8, it started behaving like this on all software andI have now got Windows 7 and the same equipment works fine so this game does not have the 2 bug/glitches mentioned below... I hope I can be forgiven for my lack of knowledge...This game's new rating as promised is 9.5/10, buy it now!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is an awesome game if you have ever heard of Crush the Castle and Kerbal Space Program then you're going to love this! (Click this link to play Crush the Castle, the best free Flash game EVER! http://armorgames.com/play/3614/crush-the-castle)I will note however that it needs a lot of work especially registering 1 click as 2-4 clicks which can get very annoying, I also found a few levels where if I tried clicking on play I got ""OUT OF BOUNDS"" it would be nice to know how I was out of bounds and I ended up destroying my own creation trying to work out what the hell was out of bounds... apparently nothing i just was.. You need to get this and support the developers, here's to hoping they read this review and take my 2 little annoyances into consideration when update time comes around! I'm giving this an 8.8/10 (fix these issues and it will easily be a 9.5/10)			"

								Out of all of the Early Access Games that I've ever played, I'd have to put this at the very top. Just for the fact that there are very few and only minor bugs, with giant amounts of potential. It's the Kerbal Space Program of Medieval times! All I want to see from this is open-source/mod-a-bility, more campaign missions (already coming), a functional sandbox mode, and achievements. Other than that, 9/10!			"

								Really good game if you like physics puzzels or mayhem in general. There is not a lot of content (different levels) yet, since it is early acces this is not that uncommon. Thus with my limited playtime atm I still feel that I have a good impression of it so far. There are a lot of options machine wise, destruction can be achieved by simple riding over things or with cannons, flamethrowers, blades and whathavenot also catapults and other mechanics are constructable. This all feels very intuitively and it is a lot of fun constructing something and seeing what happens!			"

The game has a huge lack of levels.The game has tons of content and is defintly worth the price, but as i said earlier its just not finished...

Somewhere along the way I got tricked into adulthood and now I can't really do those things without my wife questioning our relationship.  Then came Besiege.  Besiege says, ""Hey!  Hey...remember that feeling you would get when you spent 4 hours building a lego car that made no sense at all, and then you'd take great joy in watching it fly apart?  I can give that back to you.""  Boy does it deliver.  Check out my video review if you want to remember, too.

								This game is fantastic, an engineer's playground. You don't technically have to be an engineer to enjoy it, though; I'm not and I still have a blast playing it. It's a great casual game to screw around with and laugh at with friends. If you have seven dollars and an hour to kill, buy it. If you have seven dollars and several weeks worth of hours to kill, buy it. It never gets old better than Tuck Everlasting. If a developer is reading this, here are two suggestions: one, a way to implement players creating their own levels would be so neat if you could somehow pull off the objectives, just a thought, and two, this is really more of a bug fix: the dead bodies and knocked over trees are often the cause of a failure, as a machine will be stuck  on a body and fall apart, so I recommend what I call a two hit system: on the first time a person is killed or a tree is knocked over, they behave as they normally do. The second time a machine hits it hard enough to cause the first hit's result, the object explodes into a particle effect and is gone. This will get bodies out of the way and prevent ruined sessions because a wheel hit a soldier's body and shattered like glass.			"

If you have a creative mind that wants to destory sheep and outfit armor to defend against an arrow storm that will blot out the sun, then you'll want this game.

								Great place to sink your creativity in. The game is, so far, quite easy to complete. That's not the point, though - clearing levels is just a way of unlocking maps on which you can build.The real reason for playing this is for the intuitive and addictive creation experience. Imagine having an infinite supply of Legos (or as many as your computer can render) and then adding a splash of physics and great art direction that moves everything from what could have been a sterile/bland setting, to a cartoonish and fun playing field. Even when you fail miserably at something, it's still fun to see it crumble and burn/explode (not necessarily in that order).Recommend it for people that loved their Legos.			"

								11/10 ign.for a serious review scroll down a little Honestly this is one of the best and most creative games i've ever played, the mechanics were used by popular games like Autocraft or Crashtastic but Besiege perfected it. they gave it an unbelievably perfect feel, with good graphics. And despite the fact this is an extremely early alpha game (only 0.04 as of the publishing of this review) it has next to no bugs and has more gameplay than you'd expect from a 60 dollar game for only 7 dollars US. It really brings out the creativity in people. It seems so simple from what you've seen until you play it when you realize al the potential. If you're thinking about buying this and you're looking in the reviews to see if it's worth it then it's a yes from me. i'd give it an honest rating of 9/10.			"

								This game was a blast to play. I absolutely love the look of it, the art direction is stellar and the developer really nailed a unique look that blends perfectly with the style of the game.The gameplay consists of you utilizing a variety of pieces, parts and equipment to make unique and interesting machines and use those machines to complete objectives.There is only 15 levels currently with the early access version, but they get the gameplay ideas across quite well. There is also some kind of sandbox mode, which I have yet to dip into but I imagine its just straight up building crazy♥♥♥♥♥devices with less restrictions.I build a lot of dumb things, and solved the puzzles in odd ways. I then looked up other peoples solutions to the puzzles and was pleasantly surprised to see how many other strange ways there are, it's not just me, everyone is bizarre :)I highly recommend this at its current price, with more content I could even recommend it at higher price points.Feel free to check out some of my playthroughs of the games current levels to get a better idea of gameplay if you need it.

Build machines with many options available to shoot, burn or just cut enemies in half in many levels that requires you to think and make a machine to complete the task. Fun game to waste some time on and great for people with creativity.  6/10  "

								Besiege essentially boils down to this, you get building blocks and using these blocks you make siege engines, flying contraptions and doomsday machines and are tasked to destroy or steal some object, or kill some people or some poor, defenseless, innocent sheep (allegedly innocent that is, you can see that murderous posture they have in their grazing, ready to strike in a moments notice). It is a game that can be played simply with a bare minimum degree of complexity and with trial or error, or with a high degree of complexity and engineering for you to perfectly craft the siege machine of your dreams. Aesthetically the game is beautiful, as it takes its models and object design from what I could only describe as very Leonardo da Vinci, giving this game a very Renaissance feel to it. Gameplay wise it is very engaging and fun to play if you're into building contraptions, and could be appropriately described as a more complex angry birds. Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles in which the solution is open ended and up to you.			"

								This game really challenges what you know about basic engineering and it almost inspires you to learn more just to match what some of the other users have created! Even though this game hasn't even reached V1.0 it already is so much fun to play and the potential to add more is endless. One of the best mechanics in the game is the ability to slow down time, you can use this mechanic to view destruction in an ""awesomer"" way and it can also be used to stop framerate lag. If you haven't already ordered this game I really recommend this to you. Even though it is in early access the developers are constantly improving and working on the game to maximise the fun you can have on it. Even if building games don't normally appeal to you I think this one will!			"

								Quite honestly one of the best games I played. Here my pros and cons:Pros:+ It is just insanely fun to see your machine doing stuff. In fact, it's so much fun that for me, it doesn't even matter if it actually does what I intended it to do, or just spazzes out and explodes.+ The game is beautiful. Nothing left to say here.+ One of the best physics engines I've seen out there.  It really deserved the work though, since players are going to try to trick it in every possible way.+ Simply a awesome concept.Cons:-Was having a hard time thinking of any, so I'll leave that empty.10/10 from me.

								This game is good. Let me start with that. If you want a game where you're (mostly) only limited by creativity, this is a game for you. If you want a game where you can build a helecopter and watch it drop bombs on an unsuspecting village in slow motion, with burning sheep flying across this sky, this is a game for you. And if you like to sit and ponder how you could make other people's creations better, by trying to design a mechanical auto-stabalizing gyroscope this is a game for you (I couldn't :c).Pros:**+You can build pretty much anything within the scope of your medieval siege engine fantasies.+Its being updated (usually) monthly.+Good community constantly creating and designing new things, and the modding scene is good.+Once you've played it through and destroyed all the levels with your machines whose main directive is to flail until the objective is complete you can put everything you've learned to the test and build something that can actually intentionally complete the objective each time.+Once you're bored with creating machines to beat the main levels (Happened for me at around 50 hours) you can build machines in the sandbox with no objective. This leads to some things, like aircraft and helecoptors, which originally were basically useless but became much more useful when flying levels were added. +At time of writing its £4.99 or your regional equivilent. Thats rediculous. I would still recommend this if it was three times the price, maybe no more than that because of it being quite early in development and I wouldn't be able to justify the price tag, but currently its wonderfully cheap.+One thing I personally enjoy is the 'Scribblenaut' feel to it. You can solve a level in a million different ways. Some will be efficient. Some not. But its going to be your way. Thats a good feeling.+Another thing is that due to the control scheme rotations are only possible by 90 degrees in a specific plane on blocks. This means things fit together like lego. You can, however, get a mod which allows you to rotate blocks in any direction by any angle. When you're done playing with your lego, it can transform into Kinex and you get a whole new set of possiblities.Cons:-Currently there isn't that many levels or that much raw content.* I set this as a con, but it does show the game is good in its own way, because what they've done with the content allows you to make it last so much longer than you think.-The sheep. Boom.-Its in early access.* Again, this is more of a conditional negative. Its in early access and I believe it will one day release and that day will be beautiful. Until then theres always the danger that its dropped. Again, I don't think that will happen, but its possible.-The yaks. Boom.-I have to pad this list out to make me seem unbiased at a glance. And thats a good thing.**-It is glitchy. ** This may be the first real negative. Its really glitchy and there are issues with the physics and things. I don't think this will change due to the fact Im realistic. Few things are game-breaking issues and you can work around/with the glitches, but its still glitchy.-There are a few editor issues.* You cant copy/paste blocks or sets of blocks. You can't move a block once its placed, you have to delete it and replace one. The menu is easy to use and non-intrustive, but if you're building something with lots of different pieces sometimes it can get tedious.TLDR; If you're trying to decide if you should buy it or not and you're able to afford it, buy it... Just stay away from the animals.Signed - A totally unbiased fan.Baa.* I believe this applies ONLY to the build of the game on September 3rd 2015 and I believe will be changed in the future.** I DONT believe this applies ONLY to the build of the game on September 3rd 2015 and I DO NOT believe will be changed in the future.

Creation..Check, Explosions.. Check, Fun times for Sure!Besiege can really take you back to your childhood, Remember when you used to play with Lego well think about the fun you used to have with the little plastic blocks and multiply it by a hundred and all this without the worry of stepping on them.If you can Imagine it you can probably create it, The freedom to create is something I adore in games and is something I wish I could see more of but Besiege does is brilliantly, I've had tons of fun just thinking of a theme and seeing how many levels its possible to beat before you see your creation fail miserably as it rips itself in apart.The Pros:Fun for all agesEasy To PlayGets the mind workingNearly endless possibilityGreat Value for Money! $$$The Cons:Frame rate can suffer with workshop itemsHard to maserNot always easy to position partsNot finished - At the time of review the game is still in early access, while its a highly polished game and perfectly playable some may want for the final releaseOverall a very good game, Highly recommended to all "

Besiege is the best game i have ever played, and that is top notch considering that it is still in early access, not full release yet.the physics mechanics are astonishing, blowing up the crap out of anything is a wonderfull and satisfying thing, and with the ability to create anything to do so, besiege has, and will allways have, infinite potential.and if you dont beleive me, i didnt use 7$ and have over 1,600 hours in the game for nothing.if you are into any type of videogame, besiege can be the game for you, you just have to put your mind to whatever you want to make out of your ability in besiege.now, if you are into multiplayer games, and dont consider besiege becasue of its sole singleplayer gameplay, hold your horses, because multiplayer is coming later this year, and if you miss it, that ones on you.cheers, von, seukari, TGYD, ITR, and the other gal's and guy's at spiderling,stuChris.

								This reminds me of Black and White for some reason, the look and feel. Meaning i love the graphics style and music! Gameplay can be difficult depending on your ingenuity but so rewarding when your contraption pulls off a successful mission, cough* cough* by pure luck. But i still confess, i meant to do that.Overall it’s a really fun little game, and it’s only in early Access still, with more to come. Now I just wish I can find I better way to fly my machine in a straight line…			"

								This game is what Gmod aspires to be. Far more fun, and is sheer catnip for creativity. It's probably the first game that made me use the same thrust pods found on a LEM in order to create a precision XYZ control method for a stable floating platform with detable weapons packages. The fact that I just typed this should be reason enough to fork over some support money now and reward the duo responsible to finish what is probably the tightest most finished Alpha ever.It's what RUST aspires to be - and can't - because RUST isn't fun. This is fun. This is insanely polished (the rough edges being some lag for massive machines and some levels - but we're talking optimization - not show-stoppers). It also sits on less than half a gig of your HD - and runs fine on my lowly dual-core 2.4ghz Mac Mini.			"

								When I purchased this game I think it was £4, I have over 400 hours on this game, it is easily one of my favorite games and one of the best £4 I ever spent. At present the game only has 30 levels, what really makes this game great is the amazing content the community puts up, so even if you can't build that well, there is still plenty to do.The only negative about this game, for me at least is the update schedule. It has been a long time since we have had new levels, but the devs have said v0.3 is coming soon.For an early access game it is very well polished, if you are at all considering getting this game, I suggest you give it a go,I highly recommend it.

								Ok, so let us start with the goal of this game; RUIN SOMEONE'S DAY.Thats it, don't we all love chaos? Either destroy their fort, kill their troops or steal their valuables and what not? And the fun part: You gotta do it with whatever kind of apocalyptic death contraption you deem aproppriated for the task.The flying kamikaze wheeled unicorn? Check.The conversible battering ram with cannons? Sure.The spinning death wheel? Absolutelly.Space Cthulhu? Why not?If you like to build things to destroy things, you can't go wrong with this game.

Early Access Review
								tl;dr Quite fun and bloody game about building dextructive medieval ""things"" and destroing stuff with it, however there are little levels - as of yet.Gameplay:First off, you can build your dream vehicle, tank, driveable catapult, whatever you can imagine. Then, when you hit ""play"", it's your job to fullfill a task given, for example killing sheep or warriors. Another common task is to destroy a building. That's pretty much the gameplay, nothing more to say. The longer you experiment, the more effectiv your builds become and the faster you can finish the level.9/10 by now, it's a hell lot of fun for a that simple game!Parts:As of yet, there are not that many parts in the game. However, I'm sure that more will be added soon, also, the little variety at the moment already makes for a large diversity of buildings/vehicles/...6/10 by nowGraphics:I personally like the graphics, they're little details and it looks quite empty, but the important things are clearly visible. Additionally, the art-style of the game is very appealing to me. It looks identical to the screenshots on the official page and the Steam-page, so if you enjoy those you will enjoy the graphics ingame aswell. What I don't like, though, is that the focus is somehow strange, it's extremely blurry pretty much everywhere on the screen except for some little parts. I didn't find an option where to correct this, but I didn't spend much time in the option menu aswell, so this might aswell be able to being turned off.8/10, without the strange blurry effects it'd be a 10/10, subjectivelyLevels:There aren't many as of yet, I finished the available ones in 2.3 hours, however, I experimented quite a bit already. I will surely put more time into the game, as I want to finish the levels better and more effective. You can somehow guess from the menu that the game will have around 6 times the content when it's finished, so roughly 15 hours I'd say. For 7€ at the moment this is quite good, others give away 30 minutes of DLC-content for 15€. Also, there's a sandbox mode soon, so there'll be loads of more content in the future, even without the devs working on more.4/10 by nowAI:The AI is simply doing what you think it'd do (except for sheeps). Normal villagers run around when they spot your vecicle, archers shoot arrows at you, the knights simply run for you and the sheep... they run directly into your vehicle or just walk around in a little area. Nothing more. If you have spikes on your vehicle you can pretty much enjoy them killing themselfs. :P11/10 for suicid-sheeps.			"

A copy/paste tool would be useful, but hey-it's early access. I wouldn't be suprised to see that added at some point.			"

								You like building and creating unique stuff? If so this game might be for you. In Besiege you will need to make your own ""medieval"" war machine to defeat your enemies or some buildings. One thing what is really amazing in this game is that even though it's still on Alpha, there's just so many possibilities already. I wonder how complex stuff you can make in the future :).			"

								Besiege is a great game filled with oppurtunity for unlimited creativity and innovation. While still in early acces at this time it is easy to see the upside to how this game can progress. Currently it has very little choices of parts to build off and no game depth but hopefully this will be addressed in the future. The joy of this game is what you make of it, that which you build becomes that which you enjoy. I encourage all to buy now before the price increases and you miss out on a game which can progress in so many glorious directions......Oh and you get to enjoy the slaughter of little tiny sheep. What more do you want?			"

								This game is early access but one of the most polished early access games ive ever played. The UI is slick and easy to use and although theres not much of a tutorial its easy to pick up and figure out plus it leaves more to your own creativity. You can build machines from simple and efficient to outrageous and almost useless, but what you can create is limitless which gives this game plenty of replay value. Hopefully the dev keeps up with it and adds content to make an already great preview even better. If you have even a little creativity and like building all sorts of contraptions support the  dev and get this game!			"

This is the very best beta I've taken part in testing. It doesn't feel like an unfinished product. It's so stable, and entertaining, and already has enough content to provide you hours of entertainment, that it feels like a complete game. A short game, though. At this current moment, there's only like 10-15 levels, and a sandbox, but those two factors alone, like i said, are hours of entertainment. This is the diamond in the rough.			"

								This is one of the games I don't stop playing over time, and it is definitely one of my favorites. Not only that, but it gets better and better, as they have a few updates here and there. What's the most surprising about this game, however, is the price. It's both one of the cheapest, while also the best rated games you can find at the moment. It might not have that many hours of gameplay ready for you yet, but it is a worthy experience, and there's more than just completing levels to it.			"

The graphics are beautiful, the UI is smooth and very clean, drenching your contraption in sheep blood is very satisfying.This is only an early alpha release. It's very polished however. It's lacking levels, but that's understandable, given that it's V 0.0.2. Well done on creating medieval KSP.			"

								Once you get a few of the most useful mods, such as Precision Building Project 2, you'll realise this game could benefit greatly from reworked/updated building. For example, you can only rotate a block on one plane (clockwise and counter-clockwise), you can't just place blocks at half of the normal spacing, you actually have to make a sort of support to do that (in the vanilla version of the game, of course).The game's controls cannot be remapped which i find a little unfortunate. You'd want to build a machine that you control with the standard (for most people) WASD scheme only to find out that WASD is used to move the camera around (I barely use that feature at all).But, the game is otherwise really fun and has tons of potential.The artstyle is lovely, physics are fine as long as you arent fixed on building abominations that defy them, the background music fits the game well and it's just pretty addictive if I do say so myself.Also, don't let other people's creations discourage you.

								best physics game yet imo, it is being developed slowly but would you rather have more levels that are  buggy and not levels they take their time on and make more awesome content, i mean this isnt a game with a story or end game, its just a game to hop on everyonce in a while if an idea pops in your head lol:P but i would completly recommend if on sale, or when more content comes then i would recomend even off sale:)			"

Early Access Review
								Skeptical by the ""Early Access"" title, I thought this was going to be a game of broken promises. However, I decided to give it a shot just because I am a sucker for physics, building, and medieval genres. Besiege is on the path to be one of the best simulators on Steam. The goal is simple; complete the objective by any means you wish. The tools are quite versatile and allow you to go as far out as you want with your creations. Another dynamic aspect to the game is the physics engine. You could build the most awesome machine but every moment of force is calculated. Even just pulling too hard on your catapult and the whole thing might shatter into wooden bits. Watching shrapnel fly around and bodies ran from the sky will billows of smoke and fire is just purely satisfying.As of this review (2/10/2015), there is only one world available (a collection of levels) and a free building mode. There are quite a few worlds and modes that are listed as ""coming soon"". So hopefully we see further development of this title. 7$ is more than fair for what is available right now but I would pay even more money for a game full of levels, challenges, environments etc. Basically, the foundation as been laid out so well that as long as they continue to produce content, this game will be one of the top indie games of 2015.But as of now, considering how well polished the game is (I mean, just look at dem grafeeks), the intelligence of the physics engine, and the great tools, it's definitely worth a purchase.

								comparable to Portal as far as awesome classic puzzle games go. a great mental challenge with lots and lots of room for creativity. not very many levels to go through yet, but this sure is fun. it's a genius idea for a game that has never been done this well. they give you the tools and materials to build just about anything. (whether it works or completely blows up is up to your design)100% worth the full price, even with how short the levels are so far. there will be more to come, and the sandbox level has infinite possibilities. major props to the creators of this amazing game!

								Only a few hours into this game and already loving it. It's a great little building game where the objective is (usually) to smash enemy castles and armies to pieces with a siege machine of your own making. The game also mixes up the missions you do, so you may have to make a crane to collect resources and deliver it somewhere or torch a flock of seagulls. This adds a little spice to the flavour of the game.It reminds me a lot of Garry's mod - but with objectives. That is a huge plus in my book. Add multiplayer to this and it could well be one of the best games of all time. The price tag is also very welcoming for an EA title - too many devs these days are pricing their games over £15 for EA, which is a huge gamble for a game that is not finished. Besiege is also fairly bug free and plays very well. It looks and feels very polished for an Early Access game.All-in-all, this is definitely worthy of your time and I look forward to future developments. This is Early Access done right and I wish there was more like this on Steam.Jimbo Rating: 8/10			"

 What is better than inventing medieval war machines? I don’t know, tell me! Anyway, that’s what Besiege is about: building things, destroying stuff, and, if you’re a creative mind, having a good time. The game offers a broad range of materials, weapons, joints and mechanical structures as well as various unique and challenging levels, and even if all of the zones that exist by now have been conquered, players are able to find new ways of completing their objectives and construct new machines again and again.I think that anyone can have fun with this small, but fascinating game about medieval besieging, and I’m sure that it will become even more thrilling after its full release.

								(Review date: 03/23/2015 - This is an Early Access game, the criticism on this Review may change as the game updates).Besiege is a Sandbox game which you have the power of building whatever you want, with objects such as Wheels, Weapons (Flame Throwers, Cannons, Water Cannons, Large Spikes and much more), and other objects which help with your vehicle/machine/thing to work (such as traction, suspensions and movements). You can pretty much build anything you like with the assets that the game comes with. You can also flip several objects to work in reverse ways (E.g.: Wheel running backwards), and so on. You can save your machines any time you like and how many you like as well.The game has a Sandbox mode and a Campaign mode. Right now only one ""Chapter"" of levels exist, you must build something in order to complete the mission/level (Reach some specific areas, destroy buildings, destroy a % of the people, and so on). The Campaign mode has a limited space for your building, so it's not that easy to pick up and win, but on the Sandbox, you can choose if you want a limited space (like the Campaign mode) or with no limitations.The game also supports the Steam Workshop which many people shares their own machines that may help you with the campaign or just to have fun on the Sandbox (some of them may extrapolate the space limit, so some of them only works on Sandbox mode).I give a recommendation, I had plans on buying this, but I got as a gift by one of my Friends. Gotta say it was a pretty good one. My only complaint are that the save progress doesn't go on Steam Cloud servers, if you're playing on multiple computers, you'll have different files for your Campaign save and your saved Machines.The price is very fair, but don't forget that this is on Early Access stage, so don't expect much of content right now.

								This game started amazing.The wonder of creation in their awesome building system made solving the different challenges so much fun.The difficulty of the levels is what you make of it. If you decide to go and make it easy for yourself, go ahead. If you want to give yourself restrictions and make it a challenge, go ahead.But it being in early access, there isn't much content and they're a little slow to add new content, so after the initial levels I kind of lost interest. But then I opened the workshop and found a plethora of constructive creations and spent that much more time playing in sandbox.Awesome game, add more levels, 9/10			"

								I absolutely love this game, if you have any money to buy a game, this should be the one! I also have some potential ideas for future items (These are obviously just ideas, and therefore I do not expect you to put these in)1. An in built video editor: The trailer for Beseige is one of the best that I have seen in a long time, but not everyone can make their videos that good, my first idea is an in built video editor which allows you to record clips and then edit them with music and such. (Basically like Rockstar video editor, but for Beseige)2. Multiplayer building mode: Get players to build a machine for a set task or fight, and them place them in an arena for the worlds most insane fights3. Brakes: One thing that annoys me a tad about Beseige is the fact that when you stop moving a wheel it keeps on spinning, an item that could be used to prevent this could be an item such as a Brake, it would work by attaching it to the side of a wheel and pressing a keybind to activate it, when the keybind is pressed the wheel or gear that it is attached to will stop completely.So just to reiterate these are some personal ideas, and the game is epic!

								Wonderful simulator where, by the looks of things, you play the role of a medieval psychopath who somehow managed to become a military engineer under a monarchic ruler that displays questionable decision-making skills. Your noble sponsor grants you access to all the resources you will need to build machines beyond imagination and sanity. No-one of the royal court will object your decision to siege a castle using a helicopter-catapult and neither they will question the viability of placing a flamethrower next to a wooden beam within your own construction – you are the military engineer and as long as enemies keep falling, you shall be rewarded generously. I say generously, but I simply mean that you will not be seeing your head on a pike of your own bewitched machine, which, frankly enough, used to be quite a big thing for anyone who practiced science in the medieval times.The game is relatively short at the moment, in fact it is extremely short, but there are promises to expand it significantly. Overall, it is still a nice and a simple game to enjoy in the evening at a price of your fancy Starbucks coffee drink. However, I do need to confess that I consume Starbucks coffee drinks on semi-regular basis, but no-one can judge me as for I am… THE (pronounce “e” as “i” in the word “this”) military engineer.			"

								This game is about creating machines and vehicles out of blocks and parts and using them to pass levels, destroy medieval buildings and kill stuff. There aren't that many parts and levels yet but there is still enough to make loads of different machines and have fun, even more so with mods which are fairly easy to get with this game. There are so many things you could build if you have ideas, but if you don't it gets boring quick. The bad bits are that vehicles do break or won't work too easily sometimes, the camera angles are a annoying, big complicated vehicles can lag alot and there needs to be an easier way to create stirring now that they made the wheels wobble around. If this game had more levels, more parts, more worlds, maybe a level editor, possibly player vs player or joining friends games it would be absolutely amazing.			"

								Besiege is an awesome sandbox game! Graphics are excellent, and the physics are fluid and well refined. The levels (or challenges) are fun and can be solved an infinite amount of ways. Creative possibilities are only limited by the constantly growing selection of items. The ""test map"" is a useful addition for messing around with new ideas and machines. The game is definetly worth the purchase if your looking for entertainment with endless possibilities that also has a series of challenges. I highly recommend Besiege to everyone, even if sandbox games aren't your primary genre.			"

О таком конструкторе мечтали наверно все дети земли. Осторожно! Игра очень затягивает!  10 из 10.This game showed me on my weak point. In the imagination. Yes, yes, the imagination in this game plays a major role. If you have it, you can do whatever your heart desires. About this constructor must have dreamed of all the children of the earth.

								Best game ive played since arma 3. I know they are totally different but ive owned plenty of games inbetween. Here are some pros and cons.Pros: -Building can be easy or complex-The ""hide hud"" feature allows for a movie like experiance thats great for youtube videos (if youre into that)-Great level design-Never gets boring-plenty of things to blow up, I.E. houses, castles, statues, trees, rocks, knights and pesents. -many moreCons: -Early access but hey you cant complain (this can be a pro too, so you dont finish the game too fast)-Because of early access, youll have to wait for updates coming out with new levels and building equipment. (this is the ""can be a pro"" i was talking about)-limited to 90 degree angles during building mode. Not a big deal for you can still make unique contraptions. "

								It's the Kerbal Space Program but with siege weapons. I'll try to make this to the point and cover the things that matter to someone considering buying.Simply put, you're given a square space and an unlimited supply of different modular parts to build a vehicle capable of accomplishing a given task depending on which island/mission you're on. Gameplay overall is solid as could be for an early access game. It generally bodes well when an early access alpha's architecture is as well put together as this one is. 9/10. The building system is good, I'd say 8.5/10. Number of blocks and parts is also very good for the tasks they give you. Easily 9/10 for parts. Mission variety as of this date 5/25/2015 is not great. I beat this game in a single sitdown of an hour and a half before the update, and another hour and a half for the new missions. Luckily since this game is still early access we can at least hope for greater mission variety in some future updates. But as of right now, I'm going to say 4/10. Sound/Music quality is inconsequential at this point as there is no music and what sound effects are in the game are more atmospheric than anything else. Sure, cannons make a shooting noise or bombs blow up, but there really is no reason to try and check this aspect at this early a stage of this game's development. X/10.			"

								It's one of those ""has a lot of potential"" games.The graphics are very nice and the physics more or less work fine. Building siege weapons is easy enough even for someone not bless with engineering skills. Though if you think that you can build something that turns and moves quickly and gently - think again. Its more or less ""cow on a roller-blades"" situation with everything you are going to build.Flying... doesn't really work. I've tried different ways to build flying mechanisms and all of them cannot be controlled for more than 3 seconds before falling down and breaking into pieces.At the moment there's nothing really to do here. First island can be finished in under 30 minutes, a lot of the sounds are missing, there barely any music, very few parts and enemies as well. The sandbox is fun for exactly 10 minutes before you realize that you pretty much tried everything you could to build something amazing and failed miserably.So... yeah - it has potential but right now its barren. Though i suppose that the small price is its redeeming quality. You can buy it if you are prepared to wait for whatever amount of time it takes the developers to finish it.			"

								What makes Besiege so great is its approachability. Its easy to make something that slaughters and blows stuff up.Underneath the surface there is far more complexity. Allowing those who commit to their imagination to make truly amazing things.This is like playing with Legos. Its fun and very creative but at the end of the day its limited to your imagination. The game still needs far more bells and whistles. There is only 15 levels and a sandbox mode. Hopefully there will be far more and the developer delivers. (Written Feb/22/15)I made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

								Besiege is a physics based game where only your creativity and maybe a little bit of your luck can help you.Besiege may look like a game you will play for a day or two and then you will forget about it forever. But if you ask me i can see lots of potential in the game .why you will as ? well let me explaine-Because it does something not many games even dare to do in our days , is make a game where you need to think and use your Imagination.Sadly in our days most of the games are based on simple rules or maybe not even a single rule , leaving you just looking at the screen and clicking.  And besiege is not one of those games. Besiege has no real tutorial as you get into the game. So its your duty to figure out how to play. But don't worry its not just trows you into the water and says swim ****! No its starts slowly with an easy task and slowly moves to bigger and harder challenges.Right now as its in alpha its not much contant, yes . but as i said its only alpha so meaning lots of contant will be added in the near future. And already you can see whats the map size is going to be and what the devs are working on and (hell know how many levels every piece of land contains).Plus for the price tag of 6.99$ you can't really complain , and the replay ability is huge.And if you're still scared picking this game up just because its in ""alpha"" and its ""100% full of bugs and all those things"" forget about it. As long as i have played there are no bugs at all, yes im pretty sure its not gonna be some bugs here and there. But even if you find some they are so little and unnoticeable at first you would not even care. So if you ask me the game is in alpha just because its really not that much contant, but even now its lots of what you can do.So if you ever had an idea of picking up Besiege go for it 100% i think its a wonderful game and its for sure deserves your attention.Thank you for reading my review and peace ! <3			"

								I haven't played that much yet because I still intend to wait a bit until it's closer to the finished game. But so far I do have a great feeling! There already are a lot of possible ways to construct deadly machines which means that even if you managed to succeed in an area you can try to approach it a bit differently. Plus it can also mean a lot of fun if your construction terribly fails :).So although this is just version 0.05 - you can actually spend a couple of hours having fun with it and experiment with new constructions. I think it's already worth the money! There are frequent updates and at this point I'm very optimistic that this will turn out to be an amazing game when it's done!			"

The beautiful physics engine paired up with brilliant cartoonish aesthetics will certainly charm you. it can sometimes be frustrating to maticulously go about every design aspect of your masterpiece you are gaurenteed to find help where you most need it. Just a few weeks out of early access a thriving community of youtubers, sculpters and demolition junkies are pouring hours of work into this game, it has so much to offer even with only 12 default levels. As an early access it stands tall amongst others for its surprising fluidity and lack of bugs and glitches.

I have to say this is probably one the best...no, no, THE BEST early access game I've ever played, for its price I would get it right now!~Do remember, THIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS REVIEW!!!Pros:-Realistic Physics-Easy building mechanic (nothing fancy)-Medival LegosCons:-Messy Camera angles (please do fix this, its a very annoying downside to the game)-Not yet optimised properly (this occurs when you build a medium-large machine and your FPS drops from 55 to 12 when you try and simulate it).-Lacks flight options (A lot, in fact)Overall, this game has a lot of potential especially when those 'cons' are taken care of. FOR THE DEVS, I would like to see more awesome content in the future and more 'flight' options.I would give this game an early access score of 85/100 "

								A lot of early access games are in bad condition or unplayabe, in such cases, I'll often come back to check them out as they're further along in development.Besiege is still lacking in full content, but what's there already shows a remarkably high level of polish, and is a lot of fun. I spent several hours just messing around, trying to create all manner of crazy contraptions. The highlights of which include, a functional trebuchet, a full tank with articulated turret, and a working ballista.You'll likely fail often, and when you do, you're rewarded with hilarious mechanical breakdowns, explosions, and slo-mo fireballs. Instead of getting frustrated, I generally find myself laughing at what just played out on screen.I just hope they add rockets at some point ;) "

								A lot of early access games are in bad condition or unplayabe, in such cases, I'll often come back to check them out as they're further along in development.Besiege is still lacking in full content, but what's there already shows a remarkably high level of polish, and is a lot of fun. I spent several hours just messing around, trying to create all manner of crazy contraptions. The highlights of which include, a functional trebuchet, a full tank with articulated turret, and a working ballista.You'll likely fail often, and when you do, you're rewarded with hilarious mechanical breakdowns, explosions, and slo-mo fireballs. Instead of getting frustrated, I generally find myself laughing at what just played out on screen.I just hope they add rockets at some point ;) "

								This is a physics puzzler by which you need to build different siege engines to accomplish each level's objective. For instance, the first level requires you to destroy a small house. The second level requires you to adapt your design to destroy a windmill on a hill. The current levels as of February 8th are 15 campaign levels and a sanbbox obstacle course. The parts to build with are varied from basic blocks to pistons to springs and many other weapons like blades, spikes, and even bombd. And the build mode is very intuitive. The graphics settings can enable and disable SSAO, Shadows, Bloom, and Vignette. In the same settings folder, you can find an option to ignite anything with a click of a button, and disable the build limits.			"

								A pretty fun game that's very easy to learn. You can design several types of fun medieval looking contraptions like for example on one level I built a Ballista that launched rocks, on another one I built a funny looking helicopter that dropped bombs and on one level I built a moving platform that crushed sheeps. One thing I don't like that much is the camera controls, they're a bit too clunky for my taste. Still a very fun game especially for it's low price.			"

								There's a lot of great things to say about this game.  The graphics and models are easy on the eyes, the music is serene, and the physics are pretty darned realistic.  My only complaint is the lack of a tutorial, which is significant considering the learning curve.  I admit that I did partially have fun failing in the creations I made, but I also found myself frustrated at times because I couldn't figure out how certain parts worked together.  I'm hoping to see some sort of in-game video tutorial showing first-time players how most of these parts function as a whole.  For now, I'll be consulting Wikis and YouTube videos.  Considering the price however, I'd say that $6.99 is a great deal for what you're getting here.

								If you're into building machines capable of blowing up an entire castle, then look no further, this is the game for you. It has strong aspects when it comes to physics, which behaved 'rather' realistically. The game so far is worth it for its price, despite it being an early access game. I have to say this is probably one the best...no, no, THE BEST early access game I've ever played, for its price I would get it right now!~Do remember, THIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS REVIEW!!!Pros:-Realistic Physics-Easy building mechanic (nothing fancy)-Medival LegosCons:-Messy Camera angles (please do fix this, its a very annoying downside to the game)-Not yet optimised properly (this occurs when you build a medium-large machine and your FPS drops from 55 to 12 when you try and simulate it).-Lacks flight options (A lot, in fact)Overall, this game has a lot of potential especially when those 'cons' are taken care of. FOR THE DEVS, I would like to see more awesome content in the future and more 'flight' options.I would give this game an early access score of 85/100 "

								At its current state, it lacks a fair amount of content and level/objective based gameplay. There is more to come in the future and I have a good feeling that the developer will pull through and make a content rich game. For now It makes up for these short comings for being just fun and imaginative. Even with its limited set of tools (which they have been adding to) you can pull off some interesting and wild contructions. The art style is clean, cute and has a board game feel to it. The physics are fun and feel spot on. If you are willing to deal with the possible headaches that come with a early access title, and enjoy games such as space engineers and other forms of building block games, you should get a kick out of this. The current price is around 6.99 and I feel it was money well spent.This will be updated at release.			"

								Besiege is really a one of a kind game and it feels extraordinarily polished for an alpha (even a beta). I played through the entire campaign & messed around in sandbox mode. I’ve spent a total of about six hours in game which equates to about a dollar an hour for its current price; however, when they release more content I’d hope they increase the price as the developer really deserves the money.Even if development was to completely halt and future progress was not guaranteed it’s still worth buying in its current state.Anyone that says it doesn’t contain enough content for the price is a fool. It costs about the same as a standard DLC for other games and equates to about the same length of playability before it gets boring.The only real issues I had was I felt like the driving of the siege engine could have been improved (however it’s still fantastic as it is), and sometimes the camera / object placement could be a little janky.It’s important to note that if you want to get your money’s worth (which in my opinion is about 6-7 hours) don’t just rush through the levels… take your time and enjoy them, see what crazy contraptions you can build to achieve your goals.

There's 1 and bit islands to conquer, plus a sandbox mode for all your demolition needs. I haven't encountered any bugs (yet), so I think most updates will be content over bugfixes.While Besiege relies on player discovery for making things, I think a tutorial or some hints wouldn't go amiss, for concepts such as flight. But like I said, it's Early Access, so there's still work to be done. But what's here is already very well put together and is perfectly playable. Certainly worth the money.			"

Funny, Creative, and very easy to get into.Besiege is a game where you build contraptions to complete the objective(s) in each stage. Every stage can be completed in a multitude of different ways, as long as you complete the required objective(s). This game is open from start to finish, you dont have to beat every stage to unlock certain parts, cheats, or any feature, You can even disable the box which limits how big your creation can be, and where it spawns (this ofcourse prevents level progression, but all the levels are already unlocked for you). There are quite a few parts, ranging from construction bits, to mechanical moving parts, and weapons. You can build anything from a medieval tank, a catapult, and even a giant walking death robot with the right skill and parts.You dont need a NASA gaming computer to run this game (however it does help if you build absurdly large creations with tons of moving parts), and for only $6.99 this game is excellent. There are few to no game breaking bugs that I can think of or have encountered, and the game runs very smooth. If you dont know what to buy, and have 7 dollars, pick this game up, its great. "

								Only 7 hours through this game, and it already has untapped potential. Similar to Kerbal Space Program, this game allows you to build medieval siege weapons through (currently) 10 stages and a sandbox for the more creative souls. Though this is on early access, a dreaded path that no one wishes to cross currently, this is worth it, and only coming in at $6.99, well priced, for a game that you can build a catapault that launches peasants at their own cottage or a flying UFO that has tendrils that can abduct knights, if you have an imaginative and creative mind, the possibilities are endless.

								With care and grace I made a wheeled cart. The cart grew, gaining a catapult arm. Then it was armored. The cart was extended to allow for better accuracy, and more easily move over tarrain. Castles are crushed, armies and left bloodied. What can stop this armored bomb throwing death machine? Simple! The bomb landing too close and turining the well oiled war machine into flaming splinters of wood. Which isn't always bad...			"

								10/10. This game will blow you up and make you LOL like a wee child. The levels are fun. The explosions will make you jovial. The slaughter of white sheep popping under your wheels will make you gush with happiness.However, the camera may cause you to lose some hair. I found it to be extremely frustrating and hardly ever where I wanted it to be. There are no options in switching controls, or how to navigate the camera, so you're just stuck with whatever settings they give you. While this didn't ruin the game for me, it did make certain aspects more difficult to enjoy; especially when you're driving your craft, trying to blow up that citadel, and then the camera never moves, so you're stuck right-clicking, using the arrow keys, and attempting to press 'Y' at the same time.

								Great game for an Early Access title! Here's why:+ Very much playable for an Alpha release, little to no bugs+ 15 Levels to play through, plus a sandbox mode+ Total freedom to build, with lots of parts to choose from+ Great physics - very well optimised+ Fully adjustable time scale (you can slow mo!)+ Great overall art and design; great UI and graphics+ Decent price, cheap even+ More content to come in future updates- Lacks Vsync option, screen tears up quite a bit- Some levels may be quite short, depending on how you solve themOverallIt's a very simple, clean, and fun little game. It has not much to offer in levels and puzzles, but it has a world of possibilities to offer to those who are willing to play around and experiment with the construction mechanics.			"

								1. Spent an hour to build a prototype for my siege tower.2. Spent another few hours to completely build a working siege tower.3. Realize that my siege tower sucks, then scrap it's final model.4. Spent another hours rebuilding my siege tower prototype into something different.5. Completed an armored siege turret with cannon nest that can be rotated for 360` in it's top, and it also has some defensive shrapnel cannons and flamethrowers to fend off melee attackers.6. My game hasn't progressed very far because of step 1-5. But i tell you, my time is well spent.This game makes me forsake the campaign simply because it has a vast possibility in how you can embody your ideas to build a siege machine (or a car, a helicopter, anything!). Let your brain gone wild! It's fun, you will lose your precious hours just to play with those blocks alone.			"

								Besiege is really a one of a kind game and it feels extraordinarily polished for an alpha (even a beta). I played through the entire campaign & messed around in sandbox mode. I’ve spent a total of about six hours in game which equates to about a dollar an hour for its current price; however, when they release more content I’d hope they increase the price as the developer really deserves the money.Even if development was to completely halt and future progress was not guaranteed it’s still worth buying in its current state.Anyone that says it doesn’t contain enough content for the price is a fool. It costs about the same as a standard DLC for other games and equates to about the same length of playability before it gets boring.The only real issues I had was I felt like the driving of the siege engine could have been improved (however it’s still fantastic as it is), and sometimes the camera / object placement could be a little janky.It’s important to note that if you want to get your money’s worth (which in my opinion is about 6-7 hours) don’t just rush through the levels… take your time and enjoy them, see what crazy contraptions you can build to achieve your goals.

								While lacking in content, Besiege is endlessly entertaining, in a 'I'm ruining your♥♥♥♥♥♥lol' way.Ignoring the lack of content, what's here is already very well polished and plays very well. There's 1 and bit islands to conquer, plus a sandbox mode for all your demolition needs. I haven't encountered any bugs (yet), so I think most updates will be content over bugfixes.While Besiege relies on player discovery for making things, I think a tutorial or some hints wouldn't go amiss, for concepts such as flight. But like I said, it's Early Access, so there's still work to be done. But what's here is already very well put together and is perfectly playable. Certainly worth the money.			"

Funny, Creative, and very easy to get into.Besiege is a game where you build contraptions to complete the objective(s) in each stage. Every stage can be completed in a multitude of different ways, as long as you complete the required objective(s). This game is open from start to finish, you dont have to beat every stage to unlock certain parts, cheats, or any feature, You can even disable the box which limits how big your creation can be, and where it spawns (this ofcourse prevents level progression, but all the levels are already unlocked for you). There are quite a few parts, ranging from construction bits, to mechanical moving parts, and weapons. You can build anything from a medieval tank, a catapult, and even a giant walking death robot with the right skill and parts.You dont need a NASA gaming computer to run this game (however it does help if you build absurdly large creations with tons of moving parts), and for only $6.99 this game is excellent. There are few to no game breaking bugs that I can think of or have encountered, and the game runs very smooth. If you dont know what to buy, and have 7 dollars, pick this game up, its great. "

								Great game for an Early Access title! Here's why:+ Very much playable for an Alpha release, little to no bugs+ 15 Levels to play through, plus a sandbox mode+ Total freedom to build, with lots of parts to choose from+ Great physics - very well optimised+ Fully adjustable time scale (you can slow mo!)+ Great overall art and design; great UI and graphics+ Decent price, cheap even+ More content to come in future updates- Lacks Vsync option, screen tears up quite a bit- Some levels may be quite short, depending on how you solve themOverallIt's a very simple, clean, and fun little game. It has not much to offer in levels and puzzles, but it has a world of possibilities to offer to those who are willing to play around and experiment with the construction mechanics.			"

								1. Spent an hour to build a prototype for my siege tower.2. Spent another few hours to completely build a working siege tower.3. Realize that my siege tower sucks, then scrap it's final model.4. Spent another hours rebuilding my siege tower prototype into something different.5. Completed an armored siege turret with cannon nest that can be rotated for 360` in it's top, and it also has some defensive shrapnel cannons and flamethrowers to fend off melee attackers.6. My game hasn't progressed very far because of step 1-5. But i tell you, my time is well spent.This game makes me forsake the campaign simply because it has a vast possibility in how you can embody your ideas to build a siege machine (or a car, a helicopter, anything!). Let your brain gone wild! It's fun, you will lose your precious hours just to play with those blocks alone.			"

								(1/31/2015) Excellent game! Despite not having very many levels at this point in early access, the existing ones are diverse and fun to replay. The physics are simulated well and the game looks very nice, with a kind of ""vignette"" effect. The tutorial is sparse, but the UI is simple and easy to understand (and looks GREAT!) so you can tinker around freely and get a feel for how each part works within an hour or so of gameplay. Since it's a very open-ended game you really have to think about how to complete the objectives, so you'll pass through the levels only as fast as you can engineer working machines. I found that the pacing worked out well for me but I can imagine steam workshop integration being a godsend for less patient folks. Overall very solid and fun game, I recommend it especially at the current price!			"

								Great game, nuff said, but I'll say more.The first thing you'll notice is the polish.  Simply launching the game only takes half a second to load, which is pretty amazing.  You'll then find yourself with a UI so beautiful it will bring tears to the eyes.Gameplay is simple, but fun with lots of room open to experiment in trying to build more advanced things.Before I get into the bad, just buy it, it's great.  The only reason my negative list is longer is so many things are good I can't even think of them all.You'll see a lot of people complain about the camera.  After looking into it though, I realized it's not because the controls are bad, they make a lot of sense really, the problem is arrow keys are movement and WASD + mouse is camera.  If you're left handed you'll be fine, right handed though? RIP.The physics are fun, but the gameplay speed highly effects how they work.  At 100% catapults will almost always blow themselves up.  I found it nessacary to bring it to 15% a lot to not blow up.  Also, %50 feels like what normal simulation speed should be.The game is pretty short.  I LP'd it start to finish, with some basic understanding of the game going in, in 2 hours.  Then did about 30 minutes of messing around in sandbox and felt done.  There's more coming I know, but yeah, it's quick if you don't like messing around.Side Note:  If a dev reads this, I think you should try really hard to get steam workshop integration going.  If you give players the tools to make challenges it will extend the life time of the game a billion-fold.			"

								While lacking in content, Besiege is endlessly entertaining, in a 'I'm ruining your♥♥♥♥♥♥lol' way.Ignoring the lack of content, what's here is already very well polished and plays very well. There's 1 and bit islands to conquer, plus a sandbox mode for all your demolition needs. I haven't encountered any bugs (yet), so I think most updates will be content over bugfixes.While Besiege relies on player discovery for making things, I think a tutorial or some hints wouldn't go amiss, for concepts such as flight. But like I said, it's Early Access, so there's still work to be done. But what's here is already very well put together and is perfectly playable. Certainly worth the money.			"

Funny, Creative, and very easy to get into.Besiege is a game where you build contraptions to complete the objective(s) in each stage. Every stage can be completed in a multitude of different ways, as long as you complete the required objective(s). This game is open from start to finish, you dont have to beat every stage to unlock certain parts, cheats, or any feature, You can even disable the box which limits how big your creation can be, and where it spawns (this ofcourse prevents level progression, but all the levels are already unlocked for you). There are quite a few parts, ranging from construction bits, to mechanical moving parts, and weapons. You can build anything from a medieval tank, a catapult, and even a giant walking death robot with the right skill and parts.You dont need a NASA gaming computer to run this game (however it does help if you build absurdly large creations with tons of moving parts), and for only $6.99 this game is excellent. There are few to no game breaking bugs that I can think of or have encountered, and the game runs very smooth. If you dont know what to buy, and have 7 dollars, pick this game up, its great. "

								Only 7 hours through this game, and it already has untapped potential. Similar to Kerbal Space Program, this game allows you to build medieval siege weapons through (currently) 10 stages and a sandbox for the more creative souls. Though this is on early access, a dreaded path that no one wishes to cross currently, this is worth it, and only coming in at $6.99, well priced, for a game that you can build a catapault that launches peasants at their own cottage or a flying UFO that has tendrils that can abduct knights, if you have an imaginative and creative mind, the possibilities are endless.

I foresee many, many more hours of amusing physics-based entertainment with the full release.The modding potential on this game would be massive too, should the developers allow for it. Plenty of room for more gadgets and tools to further add to the already extensive possibilities for constructing whatever death-machine you can conceive of.Immensely entertaining, even for a limited alpha - and at that price, I'd definitely recommend trying it out for yourself.

								For a game this early in development - the developers are tentatively throwing out a 1.5-2 year period before full release, as mentioned in the EA description section above - Besieged is already showing a ludicrous amount of polish. Graphics and artstyle are shiny, efficient, and stylistically attractive, and there's a solid framework already in place. Meanwhile, the crux of the game's concept, the physics, are wonderfully and hilariously responsive.10/10 would fail to make a functioning airborne siege engine again.			"

								A game that is in early devolpment, and isn't about plane crashes, voxel survival, or a zombie plague? Gaben be praised!Well worth the 7 dollars, not much in the game yet but the possiblites look great. Workshop add-ons, multiplayer contraption figthing, and a fun sandbox buliding game similar to kerbal space program is what I hope see in this game's future. Also it runs very well for a unfinshed game (unless you place way more blocks and parts than you know you should be). Solid frame rate and great graphics. Looks very polished even though it's still in development. The only bug I ran into was that sometimes you accidently might put 2 parts in one spot if your clicking too fast and not paying attention. That might be my mouse however. I suggest you pick it up if you have an extra 7 dollars laying around or the game goes on sale. It's pretty fun, and more updates are bound to come. For now, it just has a few fun levels and a sandbox. So don't excpect that much to do until some extra content get's rolled out. But still a pretty solid game. 7/10 for what it has to offer as of now.			"

								This is probably the most realistic and innovative physics based game engine I have seen in my... what, 8-9 years of gaming. It's very fun, it can have hours of creativity and destruction involved, no matter which way you choose to complete each level to progress, finally, to Wynnfrith's Keep, and thus finish the Early Access. Then, just mess around with the stuff you have at your disposal in the new Sandbox, which is a Work in Progress. It's definetily worth the $7, if I may say so myself. Masterpiece in the making, good job Spiderling Studios! you guys are the best :)			"

								The game really wasn't what I was expecting it to be, and that's partially my fault, but here's what I've got to say:Pros:-Allows your creativity to flourish-Runs really well;  no bugs or glitches so far for me at least-Cartoon like graphics adds a very fun atmosphere to the gameCons:-Very complicated building mechanics-More often than not, your creations will failI'd recommend this game to the people who want a fun challenge for their creativity, but if you're expecting this to be a simple building game like Minecraft or something, then do not buy this game! It can get very frustrating, just like for me. I tried playing it casually, thinking that it was going to be a simple, yet challenging game. Needless to say, out of probably a hundred different vehicles; twenty of them didn't completely fall apart as the game started. Maybe even less actually went on to beat the level.			"

								Liquifying sheep with a Da Vinci bomberplane 10/10But seriously, this game is amazing. You can build whatever siege device you can imagine, whether it be catapults, cannons, flamethrowers, towers, rams, rolling butcher stations, or even planes. It brings out your creative destructive side, bringing the most devastation at any price.The only complaint I have found is with the camera, which can be a bit disagreeable at times, but the reset camera button fixes it for a while.I don't know why you're still reading this.

								When I was a small child, I would always draw designs for cars and stuff. Bikes sometimes. Vehicles that moved, and I would come up with all these little mechanisms for them that surely wouldn't work.And now Besiege has come along and I'm doing it all over again.The thing that makes this such a great Early Access game is the content and the price. It's currently in active development, not even close to complete, and the content that I have right now is fully worth the $7 price tag to me. The experimentation is simply so joyous. In the few hours I've played so far, I never take the time to fully think my ideas through. I throw them out there, see what works, see what doesn't, and keep adapting them until I have exactly what I want. It's great fun to play with friends around too, as group idea sessions are the best kind of idea sessions.Any negatives? Obviously early access and unfinished, but again, worthy content already, My only qualm is the guilt I feel when I accidentally murder an innocent sheep, but I'm quickly becoming numb.

								TIP: When building your structures it does not matter if it survives till the next round. As long as it accomplishes the goal, anything goes!I enjoy that there isn't any rigid building limits in the game even on the first stage. There is a size limit, but it can be removed and is pretty large anyway. If you want to build a 20 cannon war machine just to destroy a small farmhouse and 4 sheep in the first stage you can. I've played this more hours than steam has tracked because I got this via the humble bundle instead, which gives you the DRM free version of this game, a steam key as well as a linux/mac version.Anyway for the price its many hours of fun. No tutorials really so you will want to take the time to fiddle with the parts to see how they can be used. Or watch a youtube video of some of the other players if you want to lean on their experience. "

								There are two major parts to this game: building and playing with your creation (or one that you downloaded from the workshop).Playing around with a built machine is great! The simulation is fun.However, the building part needs some love. Built a part of your machine just a tiny bit too far left? well, better erase every single part manually and rebuild that part from scratch. Because who needs the ability to just put aside one piece of the machine, add something in between, and reattach it, right? Sure, for your first couple of machines you won't miss it, but the ability to move around entire parts, copy paste them, rotate them etc, nothing's there.			"

								Besiege is a truly outstanding game that will run smoothly on pretty much any machine (tested on 20 test computers). The amount of work put into it is truly amazing. The developers did all the work, and now all you have to do is create. What should you create? I don't know, anything, really!Enjoy.(PS: I would totally hope that an IOS (iPhone) version of this comes out! It'd be epic.)			"

								This is a highly recommended game, however it does become hard at times (why my hours are so low.) It requires a lot of thought, and can really test my brain at times. If you can manage to combine thought with practition then this game is a lot of fun! This game is also in early access, so expect some big improvements!			"

								While it only took about 3 hours to beat the 10 levels in this early access game, there is still alot of replay value. I could spend countless more hours engineeering cool seigecraft and flying contraptions. If this is just the beginning i cannot wait to see what the finished game will bring. There are many different pieces you can slap on your siege weapons from spikes and cannons to wings and fireballs. And for only 7 bucks!			"

								Besiege is a really good game if you like to build workable siege structures were you can control moving parts and weaponry. I does take some logical thinking in regards to movement and weapon placement and firing since weapon types are fired at once, such as all cannons will fire at the same time. It is a very fun and innovative game and I can’t wait to see it expand in further revisions.   10 out of 10!!!!			"

								After watching some videos of Jacksepticguy play Beseige, I thought to myself, ""Why wouldn't I want to play it?"" So, after getting the game and beating it in 2.6 hours, I have this to say,It's limited, something to be expected. There are very few levels, currently, yet the game, in itself, is extremely fun. Basically, build whatever, minus the lag most games bring. Flamethrower your enemies or use massive spinning blades of death to cut the dogs down. Or just use the logic of ""More cannons!"" That last point will most certainly bring a variety of universally hilarious jokes.You have a variey of missions, from mass-murder to explosives to navigating a minefield. Overally, while those are limited, I feel as though I want to keep attempting to play it, to see what X will bring, or maybe Y. It's a game that challenges you to make your designs more...perfect. That or more derpy, depends on who you ask.10/10, will most defiantly keep playing.			"

								So I guess you're supposed to build realistic siege equipment to realistically batter down castles and apperently kill sheep (must've been all the rage 800 years ago). At first, you're going to probably try to, you know, build a working catapult. You get it to work and stuff and you're so proud of yourself. But then you think, why are there sawblades? What do I do with pistons and springs? And from deep inside of you, this game drags out the most diabolical, heinous part of you and you begin to create the most blasphemous middle ages machinery possible. I built a giant frame, put 3 layers of pistons hanging from the ceiling, waited for the little soldiers to crawl inside...... and then I smashed them mercilessly into bloody smears on the ground. 10/10 Would throw sheep into sawblade pits again			"

								So, what's good about this game?+An incredible amount of things to create, ranging from tanks, giant robots, helicopters, or fortresses.+Getting started is pretty simple since the build system is pretty intuitive.+There's a good diversity of mechanical systems which make the first point possible.+The UI is pretty user-friendly.+It appeals to that little destructive tendency that many of us seem to have.Problems:-Well, it's still early access, so things will seem a bit limited sometimes.-Building particularly large contraptions sometimes seems a bit time-consuming as there appears to be no way to place blocks en masse just yet (unless I'm missing something). Making large panels can take quite a while.-Sometimes building feels a bit constrained due to the grid-based nature of the build system, and the fact that the vast majority of blocks are cubic (there are some ways to mess around with the dimensions and break out of the grid, but it's going to make things very difficult and has limited applications).The game is certainly well-made, but the early-access situation makes itself evident with a lack of a few features that could facilitate building some larger machines. Regardless of the issues, the fun of the game is certainly enough to make up for the minor gripes, and the fact that it is early-access at the time of this writing very well means that the minor gripes can be fixed as time goes on.

								I don't know about you, but I love designing things. And I love destroying things.What makes Besiege popular and lovable is it provides two basic aspects I mentioned above - build & destroy. Not to mention that you are given total freedom to build whatever you want with the available tools.The physics are really accurate you can literally blow your own cannon catapult if you didn't build the structure properly. So  it will challenge you to be more creative.The game itself is still in Alpha but is playable with minimal content. And it has potential to be the best sandbox game in 2015.			"

There are some serious lag problems when your machine gets very complicated, but I found you just have to adjust your design to work around it. I'd LOVE for them to add Joystick support and maybe even an advanced mode where you can change even more properties (hinge friction, weight of blocks, etc.) All in all it is a great game and part of that is its simplicity.

								I have found that the aesthetic of the game is really rather gorgeous, and that the physics are equally satisfying.  It has quite a few options when building one's weapon of war, however I went through all of the parts and used them in some manner in just over an hour and a half.  This brings me to the only real issues with the game, the content and contruction process could use a bit of an expansion and that  I think it would benefit from some sort of multiplayer function. Thankfully, the game is still in Early-Access, I recommend getting it on sale.			"

								My friends and I refer to this game as Kerbal Siege Program.Essentially, build a mighty machine, test it and watch it explode. Make adjustments and watch machine explode in more and more entertaining ways, until it eventually blows up so spectacularly it ends up completing the level.There are (at the time of writing) only 15 levels (and a sandbox arena) but even then the game encompasses raiding, pillaging, short-range destruction, long-ranged destruction, scattering massed ranks of troops, stealing the enemy's stuff, navigating minefields and traversing a mountain pass while under fire.Oh, and butchering a herd of sheep. That's a thing.On a more serious note, this game is really quite exceptional. It's easy to get started, but your machines can be as complex or as simple as you like. Also the art style is really neat, and although the physics can get a little bit mediaeval at times (*cough* perpetual motion machines *cough*) the game is surprisingly well-polished for an alpha, and I can only see the game improving as more content is added, both in the form of levels and parts. Sharing machines is also possible, although that's the only multiplayer experience the game currently offers. Nonetheless, I can't help but give this game 10/10, it's without a doubt the most promising game I've ever played.			"

As long as you have an imagination you can play for hours on end. There are so many possibilites to create and experiment. It's so much fun to watch your creation reak havoc or even watch it burn down to the ground. The visuals are fantastic and fit the game very well for me. Sound's are just as good and it all just comes to life in front of you (enemy troops could use a bit more tinkering to make them feel more life like but still great for early stages) I can not wait to see what Beseige has to offer in future updates.

								A fun filled physics game with more than what meets the eye. Build your own Siege machines or a robot that faps until flames shoot out of it. Slaughter sheep with rotating circular saws. Fly into buildings and blow up. Try to launch your catapult but rip your machine into pieces. This game is Like Kerbal Space Program but Medieval. I am still excited to see what more is to come.			"

								SUPER potential for a great game. Reminder, it is early-alpha and super stable! It is amazing, playing it feels like a beta, but as long as the devs keep their promise of adding new content and continue improving the game, then I can say that this will be a very very very good game.Also, it's only 7 bucks...Content: 6/10 (could use more)UI: 8/10 (Fluid, smooth, looks nice, but can you change it so that if you click in the toolbar it does not place blocks on this behind it)Gameplay: 7.5/10 (fun, keeps me interested, very stable, I've yet to experience a crash, I've had some frame loss though with large machines or machines that have a lot of moving parts).Overall rating: 8/10 I'd reccomend it to anyone who enjoys seige weapons and destruction or the mindless slaughtering of soldiers and sheep.

								An awesome game, it is early access but as long as they keep pushing content it will be awesome. Even if they didn't I would be happy knowing I spent $7 on it. There are some serious lag problems when your machine gets very complicated, but I found you just have to adjust your design to work around it. I'd LOVE for them to add Joystick support and maybe even an advanced mode where you can change even more properties (hinge friction, weight of blocks, etc.) All in all it is a great game and part of that is its simplicity.

								Nice physics, good controls. If they finish the game using design which is this good, it's going to be great. Even with a relatively limited amount of building blocks, you can build really nice machines, since the blocks are well chosen. They will probably add more, but even like this, it is a good compromise between having a compact set of blocks (so that they are easy to remember and find) and a lot of building options. Also, since you can define which keys control each block, you can even do things like differential tank-like steering, where you control wheels on each side separately, allowing you to turn on the spot.

								I usually don't review stuff. I usually purchase Early Access games and immediately regret the decision. But this one is different. I knew it was different when I wasn't greeted with a Unity launcher, for one. Two, the aesthetic and functionality of the UI is pretty solid, though the camera control is a little funky. Three, the basic gameplay is already there. The basic parts are all there. It's a virtually feature-complete game that's just begging for more parts and scenarios, and I have a lot o confidence that it'll get them.It didn't take me long to finish the scenarios present in this build, but I enjoyed it immensely. I did some really stupid things to conquer my foes at times, and I don't regret a thing. If it works, it works, no matter how stupid the idea was. So far, the content is pretty minimal, but I'm already looking forward to trying out new tactics and designs. Keep an eye on this one.			"

Besiege ReviewThis is for the 0.2 version.Besiege is, so far, a pretty nice game for those who enjoy sandbox/construction games. The premise is simple - Here's a mission, go build a machine to accomplish the mission, happy flags appear and you go to the next level.Pros:Great aestheticsMachine editing is simple to understand and easy to useMissions aren't overly hard, but they still manage to challenge the playerCons:Editing multiple parts at once (for example, weights) is a tedious processCurrently unable to allow wheels to rotate the other way while using the machineFlying is absurdly hardConclusion:For the current price of $7, it's certainly worth buying. Even when you've done all the levels, it's fun to run through them again using different machines.Score: 7/10 (but I wouldn't be surprised if I'd come to like the game more as development progresses.)

								This game takes a while to learn, especially the flight concept, but it is fun when you get used to it. The game is still a WIP and is still pretty bare, and doesn't have much content, but the building part of it is fun.  It's not the type of game where you build one machine and then use it the rest of the game, each stage is unique and requires a somewhat new design, which is what I love about this game, and I can't wait for it to be finished.

								I picked up this game when it came out, and I was inspired to write a review. To start, Besige is a game that focuses on the aspect of creating gigantic seige machines to destroy levels/complete objectives. You could play through the levels, or you could go into the ""Sandbox"" area, where you have no affixed objective, in the Sandbox, you're free to Create machines, explore the world, or fly around your new machine! Over all, Besige is a very creative, origional, and fun EARLY ACCESS game that is worth the pick up, I reccomend this to people who like Kerbal Space Program, Robocraft, and Minecraft. Simply a must have!			"

								This game has far exceeded my expectations and at this price I cannot recommend it highly enough.The joy of seeing your seige engine destoy a group of soldiers (or sheep) and a village doesn't get old. The current accessible continent is a good tutorial with some simple objectives using the items avaliable. On each level you can use all the blocks for building a seige engine with various weapons for the situation.I really like the look of this game, the plain white back ground with the scenery surrounding the objective colourful and interesting to look at. The textures and graphics are very good and i have no noticed any bugs or missing textures for objects. The camera controls are good but would like to be able to move the pan controls to the number pad!The basic physics and mechanics work well and are totally usuable now to build some mad devices of destruction. I found the framerate dropping when using large structures (over 200 blocks I believe) but most of the time it barely faultered. I hope to see more of the levels using what can be seen in Sandbox mode to add more challenge.I have to say for an early access this is very promising and will be very interested in what happens with each update and what will happen when the modding community gets going. I can see alot of potential and would like to see this game do well. I wonder if it could be ported to Andorid and iOS in the future...			"

								Besiege, a game with one problem and multiple ways to solve that problem. Sounds like a lot of games, right? WRONG! Your views completely shift when the problem becomes ""why is this building still standing?"" and the solution: BESIEGE. Take control of the builder mode where you are given a box and can build whatever you want in that box. Want a snake-thing that can shoot flames? Thats nice. Or maybe a droid with cannons? Thats cool too. But if you don't like thinking inside the box, thats fine, just delete the box! Now, which do you wanna build? The giant four-legged monster that can level an entire town with one foot? Or the catapult that fires giant flaming boulders across the map? Or... something of your own imagination? The choices are endless, and this is just the beginning! How can there be a start to something that goes on forever? Easy, start with the Starting block and go from there. This isn't even the full game yet! The developers really have something here, and I aplaud their work. And the physics are amazing! Watch out for the flamethrowers because your wooden machine could become a smoldering pile of coal and metal bits. Oh, theres a building in your way? Tak it down with a well placed cannon shot... or a fist punch... or a bomb drop... or a plane crash... or a flying boulder... or a flying sheep... over a speeding car... or a wirring fan blade... or a spike piston... or a gyro ball... or a tank... or a giraffe... The choices are endless! So what are you waiting for? The tooth fairy to come and give you money? Christmas? Your Birthday? Well I'm here to say: ""Happy Birthday, happy quanza, happy new year, happy christmas, happy easter, happy jubalee for christs sake! Do yourself a favor and get BESIEGE! One problem besiege doesn't have is not being able to press the ""like"" button enough!			"

Early Access Review
								(For pro's and cons, skip to the botttom)This is probably the most fun few hours i've ever had on any game.At first, you might look at Besiege and think that, because of the apparent lack of content, it's just another incomplete steam early access game, and therefore not worth the money at this stage. This COULDNT be further from the truth.From what I've played so far, the levels are all based on simple concepts (move this, destroy that, get to their etc) but it's surprising how replayable the levels are. This is simply down to the fact that you can complete the levels in any way you see fit, building whatever mad contraptions come into your head. The building mechanics in this game are superb, and it's strangely satisfying to see your creation coming together. On top of that, this game is GORGEOUS. The fire and blood effects look fantastic, and the quirky art style really adds uniqueness to the game.I do have some minor quibbles, however. Sometimes (and this might just be down to my lack of skill, but it is nonetheless a fault), I find that the camera is a little awkward to control, particulary when you are trying place small components in specific places. On top of that, players of other physics sandbox games may be slightly frustrated at the limited types of parts. However, seeing as this game is still an alpha, I'm willing to forgive it for this, especially as the developers seem to be very active (there are reportedly several other game modes and mechanics already in development).Overall, besiege is a fantastic little game, and shows real polish, even in its current state. Best of all?£5/$7.Pros:Addictive and replayable levelsExcellent building mechanicsFantastic art style/graphicsActive, supportive developers and communityBeautifilly polished and (so far in my playtime) bug freePromises of many future updatesCheap!Cons:Slightly awkward camera movementLimited amount of components			"

You can make monstrosities as complicated as you like, from tiny little explosion carts to rolling, fire-spewing, cannon-firing, catapulting fortresses. Just watch you don't set your own machine on fire, eh?And finally a note on the amosphere.

Early Access Review
								Normally I would never tell people to buy into early access. However, I will just say this: This game in alpha with 2 more years of development to go is more fun, more polished, and more feature complete for 7$ than a lot of buggy piece of crap AAA titles out there that are charging you 60$.Whats awesome about it:Unlike a lot of sandbox games that have level progressions and slowly dole out the blocks to try to make you complete the levels, this game just gives you all the stuff and says ""Hey, here you go! Go to town!"" And it's glorious.There are no artificial restrictions placed on you either. There is no ""You can only place 4 cannons in this level!"" kind of thing. The only restriction is a simple bounding box. As long as your machine fits in the bounding box the game doesn't care what you do. Want to make a giant wall with 200 cannons and 50 flame throwers? Go for it! Want to make a flying machine carrying 10 bombs and fly it straight into a castle? Go for it! There are a zillion ways to solve the levels, and no right answer.And you would think that would make the game too easy, but trust me it doesn't. The physics and engineering principles are what make the games difficulty.The only thing I would complain about if I was going to complain is the lack of content, And by content I mean there is only like 15 levels atm. But I can't really complain about that because it's in alpha early access so there you go. The amount of things you can do with the limited content already is amazing.So to make a long story short (too late), this game does one thing and does it very well. If you like to build things, then watch as it and everything else on the screen blows up in a massive mushroom cloud of hilarious blood, fire, and death you should buy this game. This is early access done right. You won't be dissapointed.			"

								I picked up this game when it came out, and I was inspired to write a review. To start, Besige is a game that focuses on the aspect of creating gigantic seige machines to destroy levels/complete objectives. You could play through the levels, or you could go into the ""Sandbox"" area, where you have no affixed objective, in the Sandbox, you're free to Create machines, explore the world, or fly around your new machine! Over all, Besige is a very creative, origional, and fun EARLY ACCESS game that is worth the pick up, I reccomend this to people who like Kerbal Space Program, Robocraft, and Minecraft. Simply a must have!			"

								Generally, I think it's excellent. Lots of potential and already loads of fun.My only gripe is that controlling anything complex is hard. Key bindings clash with camera controls, Home/PageUp/etc... don't work, my keyboard appears to ghost in this game (key combos that work in other games). It needs a more advanced control system where components (especially wheels) can be grouped to perform collective actions.The last release was good fun with a few bugs. I've just tried the latest update and it's excellent! Not too challenging but a whole lot of fun and some of the new ideas are truly excellent.I can't wait to see what they do next.			"

								Lovely visuals, a solid physics simulation, a good set of blocks/devices to use, and some well designed puzzles that can truly be solved in a variety of ways. Having to think about the physics of the device you're building, and discovering new ways to combine things for the desired effect, make this a joy to play for anyone who likes solving physics puzzles.The tutorial does NOT teach you how to use all the components, nor should it IMO. It gives you a basic introduction to just a couple of them, and then leaves you to discover the rest yourself. Personally, I love the feeling of discovery that comes with learning how to use a component for the first time, and having the possibilities the component unlocks unfold in my mind.To be clear, it could use some quality of life improvements to help with construction of your devices/vehicles, like:- ability to select and move groups of blocks, or to copy/paste block sets- ability to copy/paste the properties of components without so much clicking (needs a hotkey paste)I'd also say they should change the default controls so that wasd will control device movement instead of the camera, and put the camera controls on the arrow keys, but it's managable.More levels will also be very welcome, as I ""finished"" all the available levels (30ish) in something like 6 hours, but they're working on that.

								So, what's good about this game?+An incredible amount of things to create, ranging from tanks, giant robots, helicopters, or fortresses.+Getting started is pretty simple since the build system is pretty intuitive.+There's a good diversity of mechanical systems which make the first point possible.+The UI is pretty user-friendly.+It appeals to that little destructive tendency that many of us seem to have.Problems:-Well, it's still early access, so things will seem a bit limited sometimes.-Building particularly large contraptions sometimes seems a bit time-consuming as there appears to be no way to place blocks en masse just yet (unless I'm missing something). Making large panels can take quite a while.-Sometimes building feels a bit constrained due to the grid-based nature of the build system, and the fact that the vast majority of blocks are cubic (there are some ways to mess around with the dimensions and break out of the grid, but it's going to make things very difficult and has limited applications).The game is certainly well-made, but the early-access situation makes itself evident with a lack of a few features that could facilitate building some larger machines. Regardless of the issues, the fun of the game is certainly enough to make up for the minor gripes, and the fact that it is early-access at the time of this writing very well means that the minor gripes can be fixed as time goes on.

It is amazing, playing it feels like a beta, but as long as the devs keep their promise of adding new content and continue improving the game, then I can say that this will be a very very very good game.Also, it's only 7 bucks...Content: 6/10 (could use more)UI: 8/10 (Fluid, smooth, looks nice, but can you change it so that if you click in the toolbar it does not place blocks on this behind it)Gameplay: 7.5/10 (fun, keeps me interested, very stable, I've yet to experience a crash, I've had some frame loss though with large machines or machines that have a lot of moving parts).Overall rating: 8/10 I'd reccomend it to anyone who enjoys seige weapons and destruction or the mindless slaughtering of soldiers and sheep.

								If you like building stuff and making crash and/or blow things up, then get this game!Think of lego with a physics engine, damage system and explosions. lots of fire and explosions.Once you start this game, you are thrown into a world, where your only objective is to kill, burn or destroy everything in your path, with whatever insane war machine you create. Many parts exist to create what ever you want, including propellors, pistons, hinges, joints, or something more fun like cannons and flamethrowers. The only issue I have with this game is that this game experiences a lot of slowdown with the more parts you add. Since each part undergoes its own physics, larger crafts tend to break apart more easily, and buckling causes a lot of lag on slower machines ( like mine D: )but if you are able to work around this, you can create almost anything, including planes, catapults, helicopters or even mecha walkers, if you have the knowhow. Since parts must have their keys bound separatley to different keys, it opens up alot of possibility but also increases the difficulty of creating things. If this isnt your kind of consturction style, try out robocraft, its free and much easier to build in. Either way, I strongy reccomend both.  happy slaughtering! :)			"

Key bindings clash with camera controls, Home/PageUp/etc... don't work, my keyboard appears to ghost in this game (key combos that work in other games). It needs a more advanced control system where components (especially wheels) can be grouped to perform collective actions.The last release was good fun with a few bugs. I've just tried the latest update and it's excellent! Not too challenging but a whole lot of fun and some of the new ideas are truly excellent.I can't wait to see what they do next.			"

								A seriously good game, even in its current state. The shadows may be a bit buggy, but the game runs well, and everything looks pretty good. The machines you can make using this are amazing, so I would definetely recommend the game to those who like tinkering with machines, or have aspirations in engineering, otherwise I would recommend that you watch some gameplay, as this game may pique your interest due to it being bonkers at times. the pricing is great and I hope some good content is released along the way			"

It's maybe just a bit too challenging, but all it takes is a quick 10 minute turorial on youtube and you'll see all the extra tricks needed to beat the tough levels.Its only major fault is that its short!

The only minuses so far are lack of content (yes, it is early access) and camera controls (could be lot worse tho). All in all, the games is one of the best early access games I've played in a very long time.You should definately concider buying this, if you love to play with physics and you love to build stuff.

								This game has far exceeded my expectations and at this price I cannot recommend it highly enough.The joy of seeing your seige engine destoy a group of soldiers (or sheep) and a village doesn't get old. The current accessible continent is a good tutorial with some simple objectives using the items avaliable. On each level you can use all the blocks for building a seige engine with various weapons for the situation.I really like the look of this game, the plain white back ground with the scenery surrounding the objective colourful and interesting to look at. The textures and graphics are very good and i have no noticed any bugs or missing textures for objects. The camera controls are good but would like to be able to move the pan controls to the number pad!The basic physics and mechanics work well and are totally usuable now to build some mad devices of destruction. I found the framerate dropping when using large structures (over 200 blocks I believe) but most of the time it barely faultered. I hope to see more of the levels using what can be seen in Sandbox mode to add more challenge.I have to say for an early access this is very promising and will be very interested in what happens with each update and what will happen when the modding community gets going. I can see alot of potential and would like to see this game do well. I wonder if it could be ported to Andorid and iOS in the future...			"

								Well, where do I start?Besiege is a very cheap indie game that has A LOT of potential, to say that it is only early access.The game is very fun, and the replay value is high. Being able to create a staggering amount of structures is immense for the price tag, you cannot go wrong. The graphics are cool, the little amount of bugs is impressive, and overall feels like a well-polished game(for early-access).If you are a very creative person who likes garry's mod, Minecraft etc. Buy it. You will like to create your own machines that can fly, transform, or just make the most useless machine, like a pc for example. But if you are not a very creative person who doesn't like inventing, then this may not be the game for you.			"

								This is a fantastic Indie Game, that really unleashes your creativity, as well as being really fun to play. In the game you are able to make whatever your heart desires, all with a physics style that is sure to put a smile on your face. You can include weapons, armour and flying components to make basic or more advanced killing machines, either to complete missions, or just for fun in sandbox mode. Some of the more advanced machines are much more difficult to build, but fun is guaranteed along the way. The user Interface is perfectly designed, and very simple to use, with even the more advanced tools being as simple to use as the game is to play. The graphics look fantastic, and the game runs brilliantly, and really seeing sheep explode in a firey blood bath seems a great addition to the game.I would rate the game 10/10 for fun, 9/10 for the creativity made possible, 10/10 for the graphical style, and 9/10 just for the physics alone.Overall rating: 9/10, well worth checking out, and I am really looking forward to updates in the future.

								While the point of this game is simple (make a machine that completes the given objective), the machine that you build can be as complex as your imagination allows. Each level offers an objective, such as kill the soldiers or destroy 80% of this castle. You're allowed to build a machine that completes the objective within a certain sized cube (I think each side is about 20 blocks). If you want to build bigger, there is sandbox mode that removes the size restriction, but it prevents unlocking the next level. At this stage in development the game offers about 20 unique pieces to build with, but I've never wished for any additional pieces. There's so many different ways to combine pieces to make a workable machine. Additionally, certain pieces allow customization, such as changing the rotation speed of a spinning block or how much a spring resists motion. The only limitation to this game is your imagination; Besiege is a blast as long as you can think of something to build.The only downside I've encountered is that it's often the simplest machines that complete the objective. I was able to pass the sheep level by using a basic car and running the sheep over. I would really enjoy additional levels that wouldn't let me be so lazy. I say this because the game shines when you try to build crazy machines that test the laws of physics. The most fun I've had is watching my machines, particularly those built with bombs or contractable springs, catastrophically fail. However, there is no greater sense of accomplishment when you build a crafty machine that is able to pass a level.At $7, this is the best early access purchase I've ever made. For the price it already feels complete and the developer plans to add more levels at different locations (like the moon!) and more pieces to build. I should note that the game has already been updated with a few new pieces (cogs, boulder, low-friction half-pipe).Things I like:  Graphics: They aren't really high definition, but the style is enchanting. I can't find words to describe it.  Reseting the camera: The camera is fairly wonky, but it's easily reset.  Saving machines: Starting from scratch every time would suck.Things I dislike:  Collision physics: Some moving parts phase through others without breaking, usually when parts are moving fast. Not sure what that's about. It's hilarious though.  My deficient imagination: I would play more often if I could think of things to build.Unless you have no creativity and no imagination, buy this game! If you need more convincing just look up hilarious videos online of various machines people have already built.			"

Another idea I have is to allow players to create castles with pre-built walls/towers/gates/other, then submit them for friends and other players to try and destroy. This could be real time with both players trying to destroy or protect an objective within a time limit or maybe just have the castle pre-made by a player for them to try and destroy within a time limit.

								I haven't had this much fun with a game in a long while. It's like lego on steriods. It is such a simple game but allows you to be so creative in making some really unique, interesting, complex, hilarious, and disasterous machines. It is also such a beautiful game, very well done art style, love the look of the game.I can't wait for some more advanced scenarios, really look forward to solving some very hard puzzles that require some serious design thought. I mean what's currently in the game is nice and sandboxy and does a good job acquanting the player to how the game works, but some I'm eager to see some seriously advanced scenarios.Also, if this game had a multiplayer system to pit multiple players machines against each other in a battle bot style scenario I would be just about the happiest camper in the world.Love this game, my kudos to the devs/designers. This is just so well done and has so much more potential I'm sure you'll tap. My hats off to you. Seriously, just such great work.			"

								I usually don't review stuff. I usually purchase Early Access games and immediately regret the decision. But this one is different. I knew it was different when I wasn't greeted with a Unity launcher, for one. Two, the aesthetic and functionality of the UI is pretty solid, though the camera control is a little funky. Three, the basic gameplay is already there. The basic parts are all there. It's a virtually feature-complete game that's just begging for more parts and scenarios, and I have a lot o confidence that it'll get them.It didn't take me long to finish the scenarios present in this build, but I enjoyed it immensely. I did some really stupid things to conquer my foes at times, and I don't regret a thing. If it works, it works, no matter how stupid the idea was. So far, the content is pretty minimal, but I'm already looking forward to trying out new tactics and designs. Keep an eye on this one.			"

								Besiege is one of those rare experimental games that asks the right question and gives you the right answer.Question: How would it feel like to be able to build your own siege weapons and then get to use them to overcome obstacles like castles, windmills and sheeps?Answer: Besiege.The game is in production at the time of this writing, but already it is both functional and gorgeous.The building tools are intuitive so that you will be building out of your imagination in no time and the attention to details is superb. The world of Besiege looks warm, unique and welcoming.Building siege weapons to destroy things is a simple premise, so Besiege gives you a level progression system with objectives.Each level has specific objectives, so you have to think creatively and design wisely in order to achieve the objectives.My only critique is that it would have been nice to have had a simple story campaign attached to the formula, but given that this is an indie game, I can understand why they would want to focus on the core design for the first game.Get Besiege if you like the idea of building your own siege weapons and testing their efficiency.Avoid if experimental building games are not your cup of tea.

								This game is well worth the $6.99 price tag just for the UI alone. Very refreshing to see an early access game that I can actually get behind. Currently there are only around 12 levels to beat and they increase in difficulty the more you progress but as the dev stated there is more content coming soon.			"

								Imagine yourself how you construct a medieval machine that can kill innocent people and sheep’s or destroy buildings like windmills and forts. Welcome to Besiege, the physics based building game that allows you to build this and very much more. If you want to know what you can create, take a look at the workshop and enjoy all the creations constructed by players, it’s impressive what you can do. All you need is creativity, patience and a bit knowledge about physic.GameplayTo learn the basics you can play the little campaign which includes a few levels with a task that you have to complete. Most of the time you should kill soldiers, sheep’s or destroy the buildings. At the beginning it’s easy but at the end it’s a challenge. There is also a sandbox mode where you can create your constructions without limits and all the time you need. You want to create a real tank? Do it! You want to build a mass murder machine? What are you waiting for? I could list a lot more things but to keep it short: Build what you want! If you need inspiration you can go to the workshop or look a few videos, there are also many tutorials out there that helps you to understand the game. GraphicBesiege has a minimalistic art style and it looks awesome. It’s a unique graphic style that I’ve never seen before. The hand drawn textures are very clear and very detailed. Also the User Interface, that’s clear to and practically. But don’t underestimate this game when it comes to the performance. This game is like a physics simulator and need a strong PC to run smooth. Bigger constructions with many movable parts need a powerful system. ParticularitiesAs I said above, that game has realistic physic effects. That means that you have to consider the gravity. If you build a large object with wood, you have to stabilize it with some metal or it will break up. The physics are the real challenge in this game. Besiege is a nice game if you are creative, have patience and understand the physics of the world. If you like constructing machines in a sandbox world than you should get it instantly, it’s totally worth it. I have a lot of fun with this game, to build some crazy machines or improve objects form the workshop. Should be in every library.  "

								​It's like somebody saw how my friends and I played with legos as kids and turned it into a game.  While the early access version (as of v 0.4) is light on scenarios/puzzles, the siege-engine building is fully functional and remarkably fun.  It is easy to construct a basic working siege engine in a few minutes though more time and experimentation is rewarded as the simulation and construction tools allow you to create everything from basic catapults to walking/flying/transforming death machines.The only thing that could be said to be missing at this point is a suite of puzzles/challenges commensurate to the tools you are given.  The current puzzle set serves as a good basic tutorial but does not offer much challenge on its own.   Once beaten, the available levels and the sandbox mode mostly serve as testing grounds in which to play around with building even more insane creations.  There are many more levels in development, but if sandbox construction doesn't sound like your thing it might make sense to hold off until the rest of the levels are completed.Even at this early stage it is worth the price of admission; if you do not tend to buy early access titles then keep an eye on this one as it is sure to be even more impressive at launch.    While the devs are still adding more features at this point and have yet to add most of the pre-built challenge levels, there's still enough here to provide several hours of great entertainment already - if you enjoy making giant dancing robots who tear themselves to pieces as they crush medieval villages under foot.​			"

								Besiege is without a doubt the best value for money on the Steam Store. Even though it's only in early access it still offers hours and hours of entertainment as you build progressively more outrageous devices. The simple construction tools and physics engine allow for shameless exploitation and endless fun. Show those puny knights who's boss and grind them into paste or make a machine designed purely to explode in as spectacular a manner as possible. The given objectives are only the start on a grand journey that ends in spectacular destruction.			"

								A lone sheep is looking at you from about 10m away. It isn't really doing anything so you get the idea to build an overly complicated flying catapult/ helicopter thing to remove it from your path. Then just for added affect, outfit the contraption with saws, cannons, flamethrowers, and explosives. Run the scenario and your machine immediatly has a catostrophic failure and breaks into a million pieces. Explosions go off, cannonballs fly, flames are everywhere, saws spin chaoticly across the map, and splinters are everywhere. And when the smoke clears and the dust settles, the sheep is still there unharmed.11/10 will build next thing even more complicated. "

								So pretty much you start out on the first stage, you build a siege engine to knock down the small cottage and you go to the next level which will be a building that's harder to knock down. You start out with the siege engine you made during the last level and if it doesn't work, you can either alter it or start fresh. Really great game. Very unique and gorgeous graphics. My only real critique of this game is that camera controls are a little confusing starting out and it's not initially clear how all of the driving/flying parts work. I'd give this game a strong 8.5/10. 10/10 if they include a tutorial. Very well done.			"

								This game is absolutely amazing, that is if you can even play it. For this game, you need quite a beefy pc to be able to experience this game fully. If you meet this requirement, get it! You are able to build any creation you want, and download anybody elses if they upload it to steam or a besiege download website. This game has many puzzling and challenging levels to fight through, and I'm really excited for the next update. While I'm on the topic, Updates. Updates are going to be coming slowly for a while, so if you are planning to get this game just for the missions, wait until its finished. The current game missions only took me about a day to finish. The sandbox is also not finished, but it is fleshy with content. If you like puzzling, creative games, get this game.			"

								fantastic game and seems that it will only get better. Its the ultimate destruction and innovation sandbox. I can hardly describe the feeling after spending a long time trying to make a plane without any tutorials and then achieveing it (its hard to make things fly in Besiege). I had so much fun just flying around and learning how to fly this thing I created!!! I didnt feel like that way for a long time when playing a video game. I recommend Besiege to anyoneEDIT:This game is good enough on its own single player experience, but if Multiplayer was implemented Besiege would be one of the greates inde multiplayer out there.

								This game is amazing! If you are thinking about getting it, get it while it is still cheap! I have a pretty average laptop and it runs fine. The game is fun and challenging to try and finish the levels. I just finished it up and i have found that climbing hills and flying are the hardest parts of this game fo me. not impossible but all of my airplane things turned in to crazy bombers that just slam in to the target.Over all. this game is amazing if you have some creativity. I would say if you are on the fence, go for it!			"

								​It's like somebody saw how my friends and I played with legos as kids and turned it into a game.  While the early access version (as of v 0.4) is light on scenarios/puzzles, the siege-engine building is fully functional and remarkably fun.  It is easy to construct a basic working siege engine in a few minutes though more time and experimentation is rewarded as the simulation and construction tools allow you to create everything from basic catapults to walking/flying/transforming death machines.The only thing that could be said to be missing at this point is a suite of puzzles/challenges commensurate to the tools you are given.  The current puzzle set serves as a good basic tutorial but does not offer much challenge on its own.   Once beaten, the available levels and the sandbox mode mostly serve as testing grounds in which to play around with building even more insane creations.  There are many more levels in development, but if sandbox construction doesn't sound like your thing it might make sense to hold off until the rest of the levels are completed.Even at this early stage it is worth the price of admission; if you do not tend to buy early access titles then keep an eye on this one as it is sure to be even more impressive at launch.    While the devs are still adding more features at this point and have yet to add most of the pre-built challenge levels, there's still enough here to provide several hours of great entertainment already - if you enjoy making giant dancing robots who tear themselves to pieces as they crush medieval villages under foot.​			"

It's all about building the right death machine the right way. It has a teeny learning curve, but if you're using steam, you can learn this game pretty quick.If you're thinking about it, go for it.

								Steam Review -  Beat a castle by building a pyramid of explosvies and ramming it through soldiers to hit the walls. 10/10Serious review:This game is excellent, and even at it's current level, I would be quite happy to pay £2-3 for it. However, the game menu (a beautiful spinning globe) shows several levels, portrayed as continents, that are purportedly 'under construction' along with a sandbox mode. When (hopefully) these come out, the game will quite probably take many hours to complete. My current playtime of 3.2 hours was enough to complete the current levels, while mucking about with various ways to kill sheep, and so is probably 2 hours play for someone new, with no ideas borrowed from videos. For only £4.99, and the hope of another 3-5 campaigns of the same length, this gives better £ to hour ratio than I expected, and certainly beats some of the more expensive games availble.I highly recommend this, however, before you build a metal plated explosive firing tank, be aware, I did this, and my FPS promtly dropped to 5. Whether this is unavoidable or not I don't know, it may have been the object I made, but I hope the developers add either better optimisation for more 'parts' of vehicles, or add larger blocks, such as a 5x2 metal plate, so you can armour things without playing a slideshow.However, other than that small qualm, this game is absolutely excellent, and will easily provide hours of entertaining play.

								Beiege is a very beautiful game that encourages a ton of creativity. You can download mods for besiege and other peoples creations. On the downside, this game isn't updated very often and lacks content.Overall for only $6.99 I don't see what you are losing for buying this game.			"

								I picked up this game when it came out, and I was inspired to write a review. To start, Besige is a game that focuses on the aspect of creating gigantic seige machines to destroy levels/complete objectives. You could play through the levels, or you could go into the ""Sandbox"" area, where you have no affixed objective, in the Sandbox, you're free to Create machines, explore the world, or fly around your new machine! Over all, Besige is a very creative, origional, and fun EARLY ACCESS game that is worth the pick up, I reccomend this to people who like Kerbal Space Program, Robocraft, and Minecraft. Simply a must have!			"

								My friends and I refer to this game as Kerbal Siege Program.Essentially, build a mighty machine, test it and watch it explode. Make adjustments and watch machine explode in more and more entertaining ways, until it eventually blows up so spectacularly it ends up completing the level.There are (at the time of writing) only 15 levels (and a sandbox arena) but even then the game encompasses raiding, pillaging, short-range destruction, long-ranged destruction, scattering massed ranks of troops, stealing the enemy's stuff, navigating minefields and traversing a mountain pass while under fire.Oh, and butchering a herd of sheep. That's a thing.On a more serious note, this game is really quite exceptional. It's easy to get started, but your machines can be as complex or as simple as you like. Also the art style is really neat, and although the physics can get a little bit mediaeval at times (*cough* perpetual motion machines *cough*) the game is surprisingly well-polished for an alpha, and I can only see the game improving as more content is added, both in the form of levels and parts. Sharing machines is also possible, although that's the only multiplayer experience the game currently offers. Nonetheless, I can't help but give this game 10/10, it's without a doubt the most promising game I've ever played.			"

								As of this review I have only put in 12 hours of gameplay and even though I beat all the given levels (much more will be added later) there is still a ton of hours to be put in this game. As long as you have an imagination you can play for hours on end. There are so many possibilites to create and experiment. It's so much fun to watch your creation reak havoc or even watch it burn down to the ground. The visuals are fantastic and fit the game very well for me. Sound's are just as good and it all just comes to life in front of you (enemy troops could use a bit more tinkering to make them feel more life like but still great for early stages) I can not wait to see what Beseige has to offer in future updates. KEEP UP THE FANTASTIC WORK!			"

								Lovely visuals, a solid physics simulation, a good set of blocks/devices to use, and some well designed puzzles that can truly be solved in a variety of ways. Having to think about the physics of the device you're building, and discovering new ways to combine things for the desired effect, make this a joy to play for anyone who likes solving physics puzzles.The tutorial does NOT teach you how to use all the components, nor should it IMO. It gives you a basic introduction to just a couple of them, and then leaves you to discover the rest yourself. Personally, I love the feeling of discovery that comes with learning how to use a component for the first time, and having the possibilities the component unlocks unfold in my mind.To be clear, it could use some quality of life improvements to help with construction of your devices/vehicles, like:- ability to select and move groups of blocks, or to copy/paste block sets- ability to copy/paste the properties of components without so much clicking (needs a hotkey paste)I'd also say they should change the default controls so that wasd will control device movement instead of the camera, and put the camera controls on the arrow keys, but it's managable.More levels will also be very welcome, as I ""finished"" all the available levels (30ish) in something like 6 hours, but they're working on that.

You can make very cool war machines out of limitless supplies yet the game is super challenging (yet certainly not impossible). The individual challenges prompt you to adapt and build new and creative machines. This game is brand new and if it's anything like Kerbal Space Program its price is likely to spike hard once it gets off the ground. I bought Kerbal for $20 early on at full price and it is now $40.

								Reasonably priced for what you get now.  It needs some fleshing out, and the steering mechanics are wonky.  What it needs above all is either a full tutorial or a guide.Gameplay is super fun once you get going, though.  While it's fun to see your machine going to pieces for no good reason a few times, after a while it just becomes frustrating, though I suspect this will be cleared up some in the future.			"

								This is a very, very fun game. It is incredibily enjoyable. If you like games where you are free to use your mind to create anything you want in a sandbox setting, you should consider getting this game. I've played it for many hours before it was on Steam.+ A lot of choices when it comes to designing your war machine.+ A very good physics engine.+ Variety in missions.+ Great Graphics and Art Style.+ Time Scale adjuster.+ Many hours of enjoyment.+ Juicy, Plump, Squishy knights.- Few missions (So far)- Got through 4 missions with the same machine, or with minor tweaks to machine.- Needs more Blocks and Items- Needs more sandbox options, like reloading cannons/catapults.

								I have not played this game long; but in the time I have it has been more than just enjoyable. At first I bought it with the faint idea that I'd only be destroying things with my contraptions. I call them ""contraptions"" because I named them ridiculous things. That it would be walls, castles, and perhaps villages in that I was not wrong but there was more to this game. With imagination comes creativity and with those 2 together there is a bloom of comedy. Ideas of getting villagers/settlers (Please correct me on what they're called) on my contraptions was fairly amusing. Whether it was on a land-craft or aeronautic vehicle didn't matter I always had a pilot.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has time for it. While you can have simple builds, one thing will lead to another and you're building a whole infrastructure for a wooden space launch. I loved that I could save my builds, that an icon was generated for them, and that I could download other builds. The game is truly a masterpiece in the making. There are mods out there which give the game more flexibility than it already has. I do hope and wish that in time the default game will implement them indefinitely. I am eager to see what is to come.			"

								I highly recommend playing this game, the developers have very good ideas and the missions are awesome. The sandbox mode allows you to create even better and bigger machines, but there are still some tiny bugs that bother me. For example, if you save a machine, sometimes the reinforcements don't attach anymore or the 1-block wood piles become 2-block wood pines. Esspecially at builing a very design-focused machine, these things can make you quite annoyed. Anyways, I can't wait for more Updates, the way this game is going is just way too awesome to not try this game.			"

								This game is both cheap and EPIC even in early access stage. It's fully playable and gameplay is amazing. I encourage everyone to buy it and contribute with your creations, bug reports and ideas. The things that I love about it is sophisticated but simple graphics, great sounds, great special effects and physics. Just look at some creations of players - this is just madness what you can do in alpha version of the game.What I would like to see in future is liquids, electricity generator, steam physics, steam based power plant, batteries, different size of cogs, different size of wheels, gasoline and engines. Timer would be nice (instead of just key activator). Also I would like to be able to create blocks of half size so I can for example build internal parts of a car that don't take that much space. "

The visuals are great, smooth and unique with a kind of cute feel. The physics are awesome, the challenge is in the design so if you like COD cutscenes you probably wont enjoy this. I'm really excited every time there is an update, each new piece of content adds some new aspect and I spend all day thinking about how I can combine things to slay sheep and raise peaceful hamlets more efficiently.

								This is a great game! Is there a possibiltiy of multiplayer? Putting my machines against a friends would be fun to do. Or have team games to make it a lot more tense. Another idea I have is to allow players to create castles with pre-built walls/towers/gates/other, then submit them for friends and other players to try and destroy. This could be real time with both players trying to destroy or protect an objective within a time limit or maybe just have the castle pre-made by a player for them to try and destroy within a time limit.

								I haven't had such a laugh in a while! Totaly worth those two coffees. The building system is incredibly simple and leaves a lot of room for creativity, it lets you combine same blocks over and over to create ridiculous killing machines. If you like destruction in any way possible, this is a game for you.			"

								One of the best early access games out there.  Pretty much everything works perfectly, and the concept is great and really fun.  All this game really lacks at this point is content, as there is currently only one set of levels in the game.  However, these are some very fun and creative levels, and as they add more the price will increase, so if you are interested I suggest buying now and saving a little money.  Great game, and I highly recommend it.			"

								What caught me off guard was the cheap seven dollar price. What stole my heart was the sheer ridiculousness of the things I could create. A device that could spin me around so hard I would fly into a hurricane of pain and destruction for everything in the area, including myself? Check. A plane that can get so wonky that any air-traffic controller would turn in his resignation? Check. Catapults that explode before I even chuck a bomb? Check check. Enemies that run in droves to meet the meatgrinder? Well I mean c'mon no one has self preservation. The game is fun, enticing, and with the promise of more? Well I'm happy. In short, great game, great price, much reccomendation.			"

Critique the ideas, make some suggestions of your own- freelance mayhem in blood and guts glory with fire and explosions. ""You sure it will hold up firing that many cannons at once?""

								I can warmly recommend this game to anyone who likes destruction or building gamesThe trailers just show simple destruction and explosions, but there is so much more to it!With bsg. editing or buiding mods, you can enhance besiege immeasurebly:You can now build  smooth sleek creations, creating jets or monster trucks with incredible detailedness,you can change parameters to the point where reality itself starts to crumble,discovering bugs yet unknown to man, creating surreal machines.But you can also challenge yourself and build equally amazing vanilla creations wich can keep up with modded machines with ease and excelence, beating multiple Isles with one single creation consisting of just ten blocks or less.Or you can just download creations, enjoying the intricate and creatively destructive masterpieces.Just don't expect to have significant long-time challenges delivered by the game itself,you have to be able to enjoy a game without a story or many instructions to like besiege.But this is the true beauty of besiege: you can build whaterver you would like to build.You also have to keep in mind that you can't just start the game and build the most awesome creations in the entire workshop, it takes quite some time until you are a fully experienced Besiegeneer. Starting to buildA few tipsBesiege is a suprisingly complex game even though it just seems like a small buiding game you can play for a bit. That's why anyone who really wants to start building should read as much guides as you can find and seek the advice of more experienced members of the community, but probably the most important thing of all: Practice. I would describe myself as a besiege-scientist who loves to discover (hopefully) amazing bugs, and I personally use a „trick“ to build my creations: I think of besiege as a kind of alternate reality.(And yes, that might sound kind of crazy but wait!)Just like our world, it too is gowerned by strict laws wich generate a beautifull complexity, just like in the real world, you can take a close look at those laws and understand them,eventually thinking just like a inhabitant inside of the game would. And at that point, not even the sky is your limit. You can just glitch it out of your way. But hey, thats just my crazy way of playing and understanding besiege.Recommended ModsBuilding Tool mod by The Guys You DespisePrecision Building Project 2 by ITRNo Bounds Mod by ITRYou can find a site with all mods here![forum.spiderlinggames.co.uk]Recommended GuidesBesiege for BeginnersThe most basic basics.Neutex's Guide on Advanced EngineeringA guide of excelent quality, highly recommended.Advanced GlitchingRequires mods or bsg. file editingThe two guides are made by me, and yes, there is probably a bit of bias involved...-bsg.-file editing made easy- A must-watch for basically everyone, it describes bsg.-file editing in depth while being easy to understand, enabling you to edit the save files like a pro.Also, quick personal tip: You can reverse engineer any feature of a machine by saving it and searching in the save file for the controll key of the feature.Or look for hidden blocks by searching: <Scale x=""0"" y=""0"" z=""1"" /> and its variations.The Great Guide on Particle GeneratorsA big with guide on a glitch-weapon class, written with scientific depth and detailednessLevitation through Vector EntanglementThis guide introduces a revolutionary building mechanic that makes building stable aircraft ridiculously easy.And if you made it all the way down here, Just buy the damn game, it costs hardly anything at all and is absolutely amazing.

								My first creation in this game was a small vehicle covered in cannons and flamethrowers.  It worked fine, but by the time I got to the fourth level, I needed some protection and a way to dispatch the wall in front of me.  So, I countered that wall with a wall of my own, covered in armor plates and cannons.  When I fired it, it blasted the opposing wall apart and was sent flying backwards from the recoil and rolled (surprisingly harmlessly) over my vehicle, which I then drove around the flaming wreckage of the wall to destroy the rest of everything.  When I got to the iron stealing level, I dropped the vehicle entirely and went with a cannon turret which knocked the ore balls into the target zone from afar.  Since then, I've mostly been trying to find ways to complete every objective with pretty much cannons only.  What I'm saying is, buy this game and use cannons for everything.			"

								A nice and simple, yet satisfying game. Have played for around 5 hours now and I mustay it is great. It makes you think outside the box, made me repeatedly rebuild my contraptions. Loving the art work, the physics are great.The camera is quite annoying, it is quite easy to control, but you sometimes can't see a certain spot you want to. Lack of levels, I know it is justa indie game, but 5 more levels per island would be nice.Co-op or multiplauyer would be good too, have your friend build a base and you have to buld your contraption to destroy the target or move the logs.Overall, this is a great game and well worth the full price tag, but I would personally wait till they game is completed so you don't have to wait for more levels to be released.

								I may not have the greatest amount of time played o this game, but I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Sandbox games. It is fairly cheap, and gives hours of fun if this is your thing. The possibilities are endless! Simple scoring:Art and Design: 7/10This is not groundbreaking at any level, but the general artwork is nice and smooth. The destruction engine is pretty simple sadly, so you wont get any cool demolishons and the gore is fairly basic.Story and Gameplay: 8/10As I stated before, this game has massive replay value in story and sandbox mode, if you want to♥♥♥♥♥♥around or make serious war machines, you will easily stack hours upon hours with this game. The story is a major shortcomming however, even if the sandbox feature is fantastic you dont get muhc out of destroying 16 different stuctures besides knowledge about the game.Personal enjoyment: 6/10Im not big on Sandbox games, so my opinion is rather biased. I do enjoy the concept, but often find myself to lazy to make anything special. It is however a decent timewaster If i dont feel like playing my prefered genres.Things to keep in mind:Be aware of your specs, as major constructions can easily create lag. Reducing speed is luckily an optionThe game is still in development, so some things might change for the futureFinal Score: 7/10 aka Good			"

My computer runs Besiege at 35-40 fps. (CS:GO runs at 60-70 fps.) It costs you only 7.99€! That's not much for game like this.I would rate this game 4/5.

								This game, I love it. Besiege has so many options to make your own siege-engine. Wanna go airborne, no problem! Wanna fire hurling balls of fire at your enemies, done! Swat large flocks of birds of the air? It's all possible.Option to slow time while playing is very nice since it allows lower-end computers to handle more complex machines as well. Also the community feedback and machine sharing online is great. I rate this game 9/10. Only con I could find was that building sometimes is kinda awkward since you can only build bricks in 6 directions. No diagonals allowed :'(, can be helped through modding though.			"

								Having followed this game since early in its development I've really enjoyed having more parts and different gameplay elements added. This game lets you take a break from more serious titles and just build awesome machines to accomplish a certain goal of a stage, whether that be blowing up a ton of stuff with a giant spinning saw car, or using a helicopter to turn a lever and move cubes around. Besiege is optimised well, the controls are intuitive and it reminds me of the sort of cool stuff you used to make in gmod but there's no annoying metal clashing sound effect.Would reccomend, it's a very fun game and the devs keep adding more stages, parts and options for existing components to work more like you would want them to.

Early Access Review
								I can warmly recommend this game to anyone who likes destruction or building gamesThe trailers just show simple destruction and explosions, but there is so much more to it!With bsg. editing or buiding mods, you can enhance besiege immeasurebly:You can now build  smooth sleek creations, creating jets or monster trucks with incredible detailedness,you can change parameters to the point where reality itself starts to crumble,discovering bugs yet unknown to man, creating surreal machines.But you can also challenge yourself and build equally amazing vanilla creations wich can keep up with modded machines with ease and excelence, beating multiple Isles with one single creation consisting of just ten blocks or less.Or you can just download creations, enjoying the intricate and creatively destructive masterpieces.Just don't expect to have significant long-time challenges delivered by the game itself,you have to be able to enjoy a game without a story or many instructions to like besiege.But this is the true beauty of besiege: you can build whaterver you would like to build.You also have to keep in mind that you can't just start the game and build the most awesome creations in the entire workshop, it takes quite some time until you are a fully experienced Besiegeneer. Starting to buildA few tipsBesiege is a suprisingly complex game even though it just seems like a small buiding game you can play for a bit. That's why anyone who really wants to start building should read as much guides as you can find and seek the advice of more experienced members of the community, but probably the most important thing of all: Practice. I would describe myself as a besiege-scientist who loves to discover (hopefully) amazing bugs, and I personally use a „trick“ to build my creations: I think of besiege as a kind of alternate reality.(And yes, that might sound kind of crazy but wait!)Just like our world, it too is gowerned by strict laws wich generate a beautifull complexity, just like in the real world, you can take a close look at those laws and understand them,eventually thinking just like a inhabitant inside of the game would. And at that point, not even the sky is your limit. You can just glitch it out of your way. But hey, thats just my crazy way of playing and understanding besiege.Recommended ModsBuilding Tool mod by The Guys You DespisePrecision Building Project 2 by ITRNo Bounds Mod by ITRYou can find a site with all mods here![forum.spiderlinggames.co.uk]Recommended GuidesBesiege for BeginnersThe most basic basics.Neutex's Guide on Advanced EngineeringA guide of excelent quality, highly recommended.Advanced GlitchingRequires mods or bsg. file editingThe two guides are made by me, and yes, there is probably a bit of bias involved...-bsg.-file editing made easy- A must-watch for basically everyone, it describes bsg.-file editing in depth while being easy to understand, enabling you to edit the save files like a pro.Also, quick personal tip: You can reverse engineer any feature of a machine by saving it and searching in the save file for the controll key of the feature.Or look for hidden blocks by searching: <Scale x=""0"" y=""0"" z=""1"" /> and its variations.The Great Guide on Particle GeneratorsA big with guide on a glitch-weapon class, written with scientific depth and detailednessLevitation through Vector EntanglementThis guide introduces a revolutionary building mechanic that makes building stable aircraft ridiculously easy.And if you made it all the way down here, Just buy the damn game, it costs hardly anything at all and is absolutely amazing.

								Besiege asks one question: What do I make now?You can build what ever you want to complete each of the challenges. It doesn't matter how ridiculous it is. All that matters is whether or not it can succeed.You can build helicopter, cars, mechs, trains, and whatever else you can think of. If you can't make it with the vanilla game's resources, there's also mods that will give you even more creative freedom in the game!Not good at creating stuff? Lacking an idea on what crazy thing to build next? The steam workshop allows you to download machines shared by others who own the game as well!The game, however, is quite demanding so you'll need to be careful of how many parts you use at any one time. A bit of a creative restriction for you there, but that's the price that we pay to have the freedom to craft whatever we want. You can also freeze and slowdown time... which is awesome.Anyway, you should totally buy this game. Also, when in doubt, a big enough explosion will clear every mission... Legit, I just strapped a bunch of bombs to a plank of wood for the transport the two iron ores mission and completed it that way...EXPLOSIONS! "

								In terms of graphics, art style and UI - this is the most beautiful game I've ever played. The DoF is used very well, as is the vignette and everything else to give it a very 'crisp' and 'smooth' feel.The gameplay itself is fairly simple, but with tons of possibilities. Each level can be solved in a multitude of ways, and that's just assuming you actually want to solve it and not make a trebuchet that fires smaller catapults with flamethrowers on them.The only criticism I have is that it has very few levels so far, but it's quite obvious that the developer plans to add a lot more, so take that with a grain of salt. I'm not sure if it's planned, but a level creator would be very advantageous in this game, because even with the dev releasing more levels there'll still be a demand for more, and given how most levels are constructed I can see a simple level editor being quite easy to use. 10/10 would fire a flamethrower catapult out of a trebuchet again.

								It's basically all the mechanical features that I would have loved to have in minecraft. It plays solidly, and is very polished (for an alpha). I have noticed no game breaking bugs thus far, and the only serious inconvenience comes in the form of chugging with more complex structures. The camera controls could also use some work (there is no veritcal movement, just horizontal). So with only two minor problems I've noticed, plus a good deal of polish, I'd say that it's worth the low price as is. It reminds me a lot of Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts. There's still a lot of potential, and I hope they fully explore it. I have the feeling that they'll change the way supports work, but right now they're really convenient, and I hope they don't. The game is a sandbox, so your creativity is only limited by what tools they put in place. I'm hoping they'll give us magical blocks or weapons, such as lodestones, or staffs of lightning that you can strap to your machine. We've got the basics, and they're good. The game is solid. Here's hoping they fully explore the possibilities and don't limit themselves.			"

								For years, I struggled with hard drug abuse. I was hooked on various drugs until they could no longer please me, so I would move to more intense, more addictive drugs. I ended up with a crippling heroin addiction. Luckily, my wife and family were there to support me and try to get me back on track.  They put me through therapy, but I just couldn't put down the needle. My therapist suggested I find a hobby that could keep my mind off of the drugs, but every hobby I tried just couldn't supersede the addiction heroin. That is, until I found this game. Since beginning to play this game, heroin has never crossed my mind. The addiction I feel for this game has completely obliterated the addiction level I had for heroin. I never thought it was possible, but since purchasing this game, my life has gotten far worse.  My addiction to this game took everything from me. My wife, my house, my kids. Everything. So if you're looking at this game and deciding whether or not to purchase it, consider your life as it is now.  Because once you purchase this game, you can't go back. It will change you, consume you, ruin you.TL;DR: Buy it, it's tight			"

								An absolutely Beautiful game that is Worth the money, heck, It's worth more than you pay. The game has infinite potential given that is already a fantastic game even though it is in early alpha.     The game is a big challenge when first starting out, but as you play the short little story mode and get used to making creative machines for simple tasks, You can move to sand box and start building to your hearts content. Like I said, The game has you complete a simple task such as ""Get to the check point"".  Now, you COULD build a simple four wheel car that can steer its way to the check point, but why not build a trebochet that can launch the starting block all the way to the checkpoint so you can celebrate when you actually manage to land on it?    Buy this game, right,now!  (Or, you know, you could always just beg a friend over and over to get it for you)			"

								I came here, bored of the games in my library. I saw the desciption and prepred for explosions, fire, mayhem, and hilarity.Boy, did I get what I payed for.One thing, I'd like there to be an easier way to share your contraptions with your friends. I've tried emailing the file, and it worked, but I feel like there should be a way to download other people's machines right off Steam or something.One other thing. I'd love a muliplayer mode. LIke to build crazy war machines just to see you and your friends crash and burn.But this is one of the best games I've played in a while. Can't wait for more content!			"

When you create things and building things, it creates very authentic sound which greatly enchances your experience.Pros: Beautiful graphicVery authentic soundNice crafting systemKey binding system Cons:Lags like hell if you put too much blocks for your siege weapon.

								Although this game currently lacks levels it certainly does NOT lack content when it comes to buildings parts. The physics are excellent and the graphics are stunningly cute. No matter how much stuff you attach to your contraption: it won't break if you do it properly. I love over-doing it completely and building machines that could survive the apocalypse just to slay a few knights.The humor is great and the developers really care. Endless re-playability.

								Besiege is a game where you can build what ever you want from little cars to flying machines(which are very hard to make) to a giant freaking death tank.  and it feels like there are no limits to what you can make.  Plus the levels have a basic enough goal where there is no specific way to complete the level.  So you start with one block, and you just build onto it with the variety of blocks(you have unlimited resources unlike autocraft).  I would recommend this game to people who are talented at engineering and figuring things out, (like me :) ) and that sort of thing.  Because some people get so frustrated over not being able to finish some of the levels(like pewdiepie and jacksepticeye XD)and rate the game poorly.  So if your not good at that sort of thing, than don't get this game.			"

								Wow, an absolutely fantastic purchase despite being in early access. There's something deeply intriguing about siege machines and completely destroying castles and slaughtering soldiers, and in a lot of games you can pick your vehicle and go ahead in a hyper-realistic environment. With Besiege, you are stuck in a highly stylized, almost a thematically story-driven world, building your siege engines from scratch. I could see myself playing this for a LONG time. Let's break it down, shall we?PROS:-A multitude of blocks to choose from, and more coming in the future-About 30 levels so far, and the number rising over time-Art style is immensely satisfying and the ambiance set by it and the music is magical-Easy to navigate options menu, minimalist but stylish, and an interactive world map-Flying blocks and crafts!-Slow motion slider, going from a freeze frame to twice the speed: You can literally pause your siege anywhere you want, making it great for screenshots-Workshop support and mods-Well optimized in the Unity engine-Overall just a beautiful experienceCONS:-Still in early access, some features are yet to be implemented-Camera is adjustable but is slightly fidgety, as with most sandbox games-Game doesn't hold your hand an awful lot, so you may need inspiration from other sources; this is just my opinionFantastic game to buy. Fun to both get serious about creating a tank capable of demolishing everything, or just to mess around with. Honestly, it's humbling when you see the scale of the machines and the destruction that ensues. Pure. ♥♥♥♥ing. Art. Buy it.			"

								It's presently a late-medieval (well, late enough for single-shot cannons) physics-based sandbox game.  There's an explicit sandbox mode as well as 15 goal-oriented stages (destroy X% of possible destructibles, grab items and drop them somewhere, make a vehicle and have it go through a series of checkpoints, that sort of thing).  In each, you have unlimited type to assemble something out of multiple components (right now, all parts are available in unlimited numbers every stage) within a certain volume of space; and then hit 'go' to make things happen.  Interaction during this phase comes as you activate pistons, turn steering columns, send wheels into forward and reverse, have 'grabbers' release whatever they've picked up, and so forth.The interface is guided towards you building *one* machine, since you currently need to place parts where they connect to other parts rather than arbitrarily, but you can delete the connecting parts to make separate things.  I just made an eight-vehicle force:  four fully autonomous shredders (a cube of wood with saw blades for wheels, just moves around erratically slaughtering everybody it meets); three vehicles carrying bombs (each independently steered and detonated); and one larger vehicle with blades, itself controlled independently of the car bombs.  One could have instead solved the same stage with a flying vehicle dropping bombs, or with a megamachine with multiple catapults, or maybe even a machine that carried a supply of bombs and used a claw-like arm to pick them up and drop them above wherever they needed to be.  People have already made creative and complex machines.System requirements are pretty low but if you build a very complicated machine the calculations can take a fair bit of power and slower machines might need to reduce the timescale.It's still early, and there's a lot that will be subject to change -- more content (the 15 provided stages don't take very long to complete) is obvious, more parts, finer control over parts would be good.  Notably, there's no fine-grained rotation (e.g. swiveling parts can only start swiveled at 90-degree angles, nothing more precise), and there should be more ways to cut/paste components and save/load/move individual sets of blocks to allow simpler reuse and assembly.  The ways you assemble things could certainly use some work, because while you *can* do a lot, you can get into situations where you simply need to tear something down and rebuild it entirely because you can only move all blocks at once rather than lift or shift a section.If you're looking for something to brutally challenge you on its own (rather than with self-imposed handicaps), this isn't it yet -- it probably won't take you long to 'beat'.  If you enjoy a more freeform exercise where you can take situations and see how you resolve them in goofy ways, or if you have a yen to reconstruct giant siege engines without terrifying your neighbors and getting the police called on you, this is definitely worth a look.

								Pretty good, fun, physics/sandbox game. Have you ever wanted to destroy things to get your way in this world? That's what Besiege is for! Destroy Kingdoms and have them meet their downfall. Build your War Machines to conquer lands. I sure did...for a little bit before the machine fell apart... Anyway, despite it being difficult to work around the flaws in your build, it's still a good game. I would reccommend knowing a good amount of physics before planning to finish this game quickly. I don't know a whole lot and still got by in this game fairly well so far, despite my failed builds. Anyway, if you're interested in a Mediveal Building/Sandbox Physics game, i'd reccommend getting this one. It's very cheap for what you get out of it. You'll enjoy it.			"

								I normally do not ever buy Early Access games on Steam, no matter how beautiful and polished they appear. If it's so wonderful, they can complete and release the game and I'll pay for it then. But Besiege is actually beautiful and polished, and I'm glad I lost my mind for a second and bought it despite its being in Early Access. It's a clever game with lovely graphics and an active dev team, and even if all development were to stop today, it'd be good enough to be worth the price.Which is not to say that I personally love playing it. I didn't like Kerbal Space Program, and while I like this game better, it's still extremely hard for me to get into because I have trouble visualizing or imagining how a piece will act on or be acted on by the other pieces once you press ""play"" and set the machine into motion. I struggled with designing complex machines or machines that ran smoothly, and I mostly just blundered through the first few levels with a combination of luck and some deeply janky contraptions.But, even if you're not sure this is your type of game, I suggest giving it a spin. It's a cool little indie project that lives up to the hype. Rating: 3/55: Loved it; 4: Liked it; 3: It's OK; 2: Didn't like it; 1: Hated it "

Fun to both get serious about creating a tank capable of demolishing everything, or just to mess around with. Honestly, it's humbling when you see the scale of the machines and the destruction that ensues. Pure. ♥♥♥♥ing. Art. Buy it.			"

Early Access Review
								*** Update ***It's been confirmed by the developers that there will be an update shortly that will be using the Unity 5 engine. This will support multi core PhysX which will address the problems that many users are facing. As the developers are aware of the issue and are providing an imminent fix then I can now recommend the game based on the game play alone._______________________________________________Right now, it's impossible to recommend this game. This isn't due to the mechanics or game play, or even the relative lack of content so far is it is still in early access. I am referring to the terrible frame rate drops that occur once structures get to big. By 'too big' I mean anything with 50+ blocks and by 'terrible frame rate' I'm talking about a drop from 60fps down to 3. Three. 1 + 2. Uno, dos, tres. Now looking at the required system specs above they've fairly basic;Processor: 2.2Ghz Dual Core Memory: 2 GB RAM Graphics: 512mb Dedicated VRAMI'm runningProcessor: 2.9Ghz Quad Code i7Memory: 8GB RAMGraphics: GTX 860M with 2GB of vRAMSo it clearly isn't my set up that's causing the problem. My playtime above has lasted as long as it has as to begin with I didn't really know what I was doing and as such only really started to make large contraptions in the last half an hour or so of game play. Things may improve in future updates, but who knows, as it is this game is almost unplayable.			"

								Review based on ver. 0.02This game is simple, to build a machine that you can control it to complete the level.Pros:1. Game machanics is well done and gameplay is entertaining. 2. Graphics is very beautiful and stylish.3. The level design is good and gets harder when you proceed.4. The price is very reasonable and acceptable. For $6.99, you can't go wrong.Cons:1. It is Unity3d engine powered games, so the quality of dynamic shadow is a big issue.2. Pretty bad performance because of Unity engine. In level 5, my PC cannot handle it.FPS is about 5 but I am playing it on a 24-core machine with a GTX Titan...3. Lack of variation in sound effect and ambient sound. 4. Lack of some basic options in menu.Since it is on very very early stage, sound and options will be better for sure. The most problems come fromthe Unity engine not the developers. It they chose UE4 instead of Unity, they would not have these issues.But it is not their fault so I can't really blame them on this point. And still, I really enjoy playing it.With a lot of potentias, it will definitely be a great game which worth at least $14.99.So, it is still good for $6.99, and highly recommended.Update 1:Just did a quick check on both GPU and CPU usage. It seems that problem comes fromUnity engine's bad performance of CPU physics simulation. It is unoptimized for multi-core and multi-threading, when your siege machine is too complex.It still uses only 1 or 2 cores to calculate the physics which can bottleneck other hardware.Hope they could fix this in the future.

								Already very fun, but has potential for so much more. Gorgeous graphics and artstyle. Nice looking minimalistic interface (maybe a little too minimalistic). Right now, the game sorely lacks the ability to move segments of the machine independently from each other. If you wanna make a longer arm for your catapult, you have to delete the whole thing and build it again instead of just making it longer. But that will come, I'm sure. I just hope the development will be rapid and will lead to a finished product, which is far too uncommon for early access games, unfortunately.			"

I made a box with a propellor on top. It flew up in the air spinning wildly. I've made some better things, like a bomber that actually works really well and can beat nearly every level in the game and a tank that nearly crashed the game. This is the most beautiful game in the world and needs more recognition.

								For years, I struggled with hard drug abuse. I was hooked on various drugs until they could no longer please me, so I would move to more intense, more addictive drugs. I ended up with a crippling heroin addiction. Luckily, my wife and family were there to support me and try to get me back on track.  They put me through therapy, but I just couldn't put down the needle. My therapist suggested I find a hobby that could keep my mind off of the drugs, but every hobby I tried just couldn't supersede the addiction heroin. That is, until I found this game. Since beginning to play this game, heroin has never crossed my mind. The addiction I feel for this game has completely obliterated the addiction level I had for heroin. I never thought it was possible, but since purchasing this game, my life has gotten far worse.  My addiction to this game took everything from me. My wife, my house, my kids. Everything. So if you're looking at this game and deciding whether or not to purchase it, consider your life as it is now.  Because once you purchase this game, you can't go back. It will change you, consume you, ruin you.TL;DR: Buy it, it's tight			"

								Although this game currently lacks levels it certainly does NOT lack content when it comes to buildings parts. The physics are excellent and the graphics are stunningly cute. No matter how much stuff you attach to your contraption: it won't break if you do it properly. I love over-doing it completely and building machines that could survive the apocalypse just to slay a few knights.The humor is great and the developers really care. Endless re-playability. I love it.			"

								I can see this game having a fair bit of longevity - even after completing the levels, you come back to see if there is a better way, either by improving your machine or creating an alternative one. For an Early Access game, it is very stable - I've not had any crashes or problems at all. At the moment, there is a whole level to play plus the sandbox (minus some textures) - but everything is working.			"

								My first creation in this game was a small vehicle covered in cannons and flamethrowers.  It worked fine, but by the time I got to the fourth level, I needed some protection and a way to dispatch the wall in front of me.  So, I countered that wall with a wall of my own, covered in armor plates and cannons.  When I fired it, it blasted the opposing wall apart and was sent flying backwards from the recoil and rolled (surprisingly harmlessly) over my vehicle, which I then drove around the flaming wreckage of the wall to destroy the rest of everything.  When I got to the iron stealing level, I dropped the vehicle entirely and went with a cannon turret which knocked the ore balls into the target zone from afar.  Since then, I've mostly been trying to find ways to complete every objective with pretty much cannons only.  What I'm saying is, buy this game and use cannons for everything.			"

								I can warmly recommend this game to anyone who likes destruction or building gamesThe trailers just show simple destruction and explosions, but there is so much more to it!With bsg. editing or buiding mods, you can enhance besiege immeasurebly:You can now build  smooth sleek creations, creating jets or monster trucks with incredible detailedness,you can change parameters to the point where reality itself starts to crumble,discovering bugs yet unknown to man, creating surreal machines.But you can also challenge yourself and build equally amazing vanilla creations wich can keep up with modded machines with ease and excelence, beating multiple Isles with one single creation consisting of just ten blocks or less.Or you can just download creations, enjoying the intricate and creatively destructive masterpieces.Just don't expect to have significant long-time challenges delivered by the game itself,you have to be able to enjoy a game without a story or many instructions to like besiege.But this is the true beauty of besiege: you can build whaterver you would like to build.You also have to keep in mind that you can't just start the game and build the most awesome creations in the entire workshop, it takes quite some time until you are a fully experienced Besiegeneer. Starting to buildA few tipsBesiege is a suprisingly complex game even though it just seems like a small buiding game you can play for a bit. That's why anyone who really wants to start building should read as much guides as you can find and seek the advice of more experienced members of the community, but probably the most important thing of all: Practice. I would describe myself as a besiege-scientist who loves to discover (hopefully) amazing bugs, and I personally use a „trick“ to build my creations: I think of besiege as a kind of alternate reality.(And yes, that might sound kind of crazy but wait!)Just like our world, it too is gowerned by strict laws wich generate a beautifull complexity, just like in the real world, you can take a close look at those laws and understand them,eventually thinking just like a inhabitant inside of the game would. And at that point, not even the sky is your limit. You can just glitch it out of your way. But hey, thats just my crazy way of playing and understanding besiege.Recommended ModsBuilding Tool mod by The Guys You DespisePrecision Building Project 2 by ITRNo Bounds Mod by ITRYou can find a site with all mods here![forum.spiderlinggames.co.uk]Recommended GuidesBesiege for BeginnersThe most basic basics.Neutex's Guide on Advanced EngineeringA guide of excelent quality, highly recommended.Advanced GlitchingRequires mods or bsg. file editingThe two guides are made by me, and yes, there is probably a bit of bias involved...-bsg.-file editing made easy- A must-watch for basically everyone, it describes bsg.-file editing in depth while being easy to understand, enabling you to edit the save files like a pro.Also, quick personal tip: You can reverse engineer any feature of a machine by saving it and searching in the save file for the controll key of the feature.Or look for hidden blocks by searching: <Scale x=""0"" y=""0"" z=""1"" /> and its variations.The Great Guide on Particle GeneratorsA big with guide on a glitch-weapon class, written with scientific depth and detailednessLevitation through Vector EntanglementThis guide introduces a revolutionary building mechanic that makes building stable aircraft ridiculously easy.And if you made it all the way down here, Just buy the damn game, it costs hardly anything at all and is absolutely amazing.

								Play this if you like building contraptions, if you are not a good builder or you dont like trial and error because you WILL be testing things over and over then you should probably let this one slip by. But if you're creative and you have fun building vehicles and machines then i would recommend this one. A great physics sandbox game. if you even like puzzles then this one could even be worth a try since you have to complete certain levels if you're not just screw'in around in sanbox mode. Have fun.

								Besiege has been on my wishlist for at least a year now and kept not getting bought by me until I finally picked it up in the winter sale and - WOW - THIS IS A COOL GAME. I was afraid it'd be a bit complex or have weird controls but no - what I cool game. I love crushing the little people beneath my wheels with a monstrous contraption that breaks apart and spawns smaller contraptions spinning and hawing their way through the battlefield setting everything and everyone on fire. So cool. Needs an instant replay function. I emphatically recommend this game. I wish I'd bought it a year ago.			"

								Pretty good, fun, physics/sandbox game. Have you ever wanted to destroy things to get your way in this world? That's what Besiege is for! Destroy Kingdoms and have them meet their downfall. Build your War Machines to conquer lands. I sure did...for a little bit before the machine fell apart... Anyway, despite it being difficult to work around the flaws in your build, it's still a good game. I would reccommend knowing a good amount of physics before planning to finish this game quickly. I don't know a whole lot and still got by in this game fairly well so far, despite my failed builds. Anyway, if you're interested in a Mediveal Building/Sandbox Physics game, i'd reccommend getting this one. It's very cheap for what you get out of it. You'll enjoy it.			"

Early Access Review
								Indie games can sometimes be hit or miss with today’s gamers, but we can’t overlook their importance for the industry.  Besiege falls into this category, but with a major twist.It’s in alpha.Now don’t get discouraged, friends.  I know what you’re thinking.  This, pay-for-an-unfinished-game-before-it-comes-out thinking that seems to be wildly popular on formats such as Steam is a silly way to run an industry.  Why should you pay for an unfinished game?  There’s a reason. Besiege is a medieval weapons building and physics simulator.  A lot to take in yes, but let me explain.  You are given multiple building materials, moving bits, and yes, crazy medieval weapons.  The current version of the game has one of five worlds open.  You are given a task in each level of the world, such as destroy a house or kill 90% of everything, and cannot move to the next level without completing the task at hand.  The fun part comes from how you do it.  There are no restrictions, and however you get the job done is up to you.  You can be simple or extravagant.  The choice is yours. Besiege presents you with a blank slate, teaming with destructive, creative potential.  Do you build a trebuchet?  Or perhaps a wall of cannons?  Maybe you just want to see how ridiculous you can get and still beat the level.  These are all possible scenarios.  Additionally, this game looks fantastic for a game in alpha.  It also plays great. And sounds great.  This game quickly makes you forget that it is in alpha.This bring me back to the original point.  Yes it is in alpha.  But does that take away from the game?  Perhaps content wise, yes, but the folks at Spiderling Games have proven their worth in the small amount available.  Rather than open a lot of the game at lower quality, the developers took the time to concentrate on one area of the game and make it represent closer to what the finished product may ultimately look like.  Because of this, the alpha version of Besiege feels complete.  The seven dollars you may have reluctantly paid for “another buggy early access game” quickly becomes worth it as you see your giant flame throwing head you modeled after Steve Buscemi’s face burn a bunch of sheep alive, although that may not be exactly the goal given to you. Did I mention the sheep?Failure is spectacular in this game and actually quite a big part of the hilarity.  The grander your killing machine the more spectacular the destruction can be if you don’t build it right.  Sometimes, you even find yourself setting yourself up for failure, just to see the results. Besiege’s incomplete state does leave you with the feeling of yearning for something more.  It is short and can seem to be unfulfilling after a while but, thankfully, the developers address this too.  Regular updates occur to Besiege with new blocks and weapons every so often, and new worlds have estimated release dates on them.  This keeps me going, and involved with the game because I know that more content will soon be added. The physical game plays well with minor problems.  One of the few is the camera.  While it is fairly easy to grasp, it can be difficult at times to move throughout the playable field which is necessary on larger missions.  Additionally, it can sometimes be cumbersome to re-map key bindings on more complicated machines, but the time you invest in this will make for a beautiful result in the long run. I have bought alpha-stage games before only to be disappointed that they never come to fruition or are simply unplayable.  Besiege is the first game i actually feel like the developers will keep adding to it until it is finished.  This, to me, is the benefit of early access gaming.  Small developers, like Spiderling Games, can take the time to make what they really want, while keeping fans interested. VERDICT? Just buy it! Ultimately, the game an early access game, but don’t let that discourage you.  For seven dollars it is an absolute BARGAIN.  There is so much creative potential, it looks fantastic, its intuitive, and it still has more content coming.  The continued playability doubled with the future release of more content makes this game extremely appealing, and should more than make up for its few shortcomings			"

								GameplayCasual sandbox physics simulator. Endless possibilities and creative freedom. Besiege offers a growing number of parts/weapons/tools at your disposal to complete a variety of challenges. Physics work believably, constructing and testing different machines is challenging. Each zone consists of one objective and the ability to construct a new machine or edit the previously successful vehicle. Simple in nature but the difficulty slowly rises as you must become more creative in your designs. One zone you might grab and carry boulders to a marker, and the next you could be constructing flying machines to take down gunships.Controls are widely customizable in terms of part functions. Camera controls are a bit awkward once you start driving/flying your machine, making it frustrating to operate. Currently includes a nice sandbox mode for testing builds. Besiege seems to be regularly updated which is a nice thing to see in an Early Access.SoundFairly absent of any noticeable music, not entirely a downside but it would help break up the silence and occasional animal/soldier sound effects.GraphicsSimplistic and charming. Environments are created on an endless plane and while these structures are constricted to a small area, they appear more like artistic renders than simply blocks waiting to fall over. Enemies and objects are minimal but beautifully crafted. Destruction works in an enjoyably fluid way, meaning each piece and part reacts accordingly once effected by another object/weapon. Visual effects like fire/smoke/sparks are mesmerizing and even more so once you slow down time using the in-game slider.Replay ValueA great deal of replay value is possible in Besiege and the increasing number of updates add new parts to tinker with. However this is largely dependent on the players creativity. Starting out it may seem a little rocky but once you familiarize yourself with the function of each part you'll begin to create more intricate machines. Each zone offers the same objective but the creative control aspect makes for an infinite number of ways to complete it.Wrapping UpCharming, challenging, and enjoyable. Easy to learn but hard to master. With a very reasonable price tag, Besiege is a solid Early Access title that is shaping up to be an incredibly worthwhile game.			"

								Besiege asks one question: What do I make now?You can build what ever you want to complete each of the challenges. It doesn't matter how ridiculous it is. All that matters is whether or not it can succeed.You can build helicopter, cars, mechs, trains, and whatever else you can think of. If you can't make it with the vanilla game's resources, there's also mods that will give you even more creative freedom in the game!Not good at creating stuff? Lacking an idea on what crazy thing to build next? The steam workshop allows you to download machines shared by others who own the game as well!The game, however, is quite demanding so you'll need to be careful of how many parts you use at any one time. A bit of a creative restriction for you there, but that's the price that we pay to have the freedom to craft whatever we want. You can also freeze and slowdown time... which is awesome.Anyway, you should totally buy this game. Also, when in doubt, a big enough explosion will clear every mission... Legit, I just strapped a bunch of bombs to a plank of wood for the transport the two iron ores mission and completed it that way...EXPLOSIONS! "

								Having followed this game since early in its development I've really enjoyed having more parts and different gameplay elements added. This game lets you take a break from more serious titles and just build awesome machines to accomplish a certain goal of a stage, whether that be blowing up a ton of stuff with a giant spinning saw car, or using a helicopter to turn a lever and move cubes around. Besiege is optimised well, the controls are intuitive and it reminds me of the sort of cool stuff you used to make in gmod but there's no annoying metal clashing sound effect.Would reccomend, it's a very fun game and the devs keep adding more stages, parts and options for existing components to work more like you would want them to.

And soon, they are going to add multiplayer... and a level editor!! Jesus christ on a bloody bicycle! Im can see a very bright future for this game, and the Besiege team has done a great job. And whey they add multiplayer and level editor in around september this year, it will be a lot more fun, to be able to create custom games, veichles, and levels with friends, and just see the mayhem. ill end this with three words.

								I can warmly recommend this game to anyone who likes destruction or building gamesThe trailers just show simple destruction and explosions, but there is so much more to it!With bsg. editing or buiding mods, you can enhance besiege immeasurebly:You can now build  smooth sleek creations, creating jets or monster trucks with incredible detailedness,you can change parameters to the point where reality itself starts to crumble,discovering bugs yet unknown to man, creating surreal machines.But you can also challenge yourself and build equally amazing vanilla creations wich can keep up with modded machines with ease and excelence, beating multiple Isles with one single creation consisting of just ten blocks or less.Or you can just download creations, enjoying the intricate and creatively destructive masterpieces.Just don't expect to have significant long-time challenges delivered by the game itself,you have to be able to enjoy a game without a story or many instructions to like besiege.But this is the true beauty of besiege: you can build whaterver you would like to build.You also have to keep in mind that you can't just start the game and build the most awesome creations in the entire workshop, it takes quite some time until you are a fully experienced Besiegeneer. Starting to buildA few tipsBesiege is a suprisingly complex game even though it just seems like a small buiding game you can play for a bit. That's why anyone who really wants to start building should read as much guides as you can find and seek the advice of more experienced members of the community, but probably the most important thing of all: Practice. I would describe myself as a besiege-scientist who loves to discover (hopefully) amazing bugs, and I personally use a „trick“ to build my creations: I think of besiege as a kind of alternate reality.(And yes, that might sound kind of crazy but wait!)Just like our world, it too is gowerned by strict laws wich generate a beautifull complexity, just like in the real world, you can take a close look at those laws and understand them,eventually thinking just like a inhabitant inside of the game would. And at that point, not even the sky is your limit. You can just glitch it out of your way. But hey, thats just my crazy way of playing and understanding besiege.Recommended ModsBuilding Tool mod by The Guys You DespisePrecision Building Project 2 by ITRNo Bounds Mod by ITRYou can find a site with all mods here![forum.spiderlinggames.co.uk]Recommended GuidesBesiege for BeginnersThe most basic basics.Neutex's Guide on Advanced EngineeringA guide of excelent quality, highly recommended.Advanced GlitchingRequires mods or bsg. file editingThe two guides are made by me, and yes, there is probably a bit of bias involved...-bsg.-file editing made easy- A must-watch for basically everyone, it describes bsg.-file editing in depth while being easy to understand, enabling you to edit the save files like a pro.Also, quick personal tip: You can reverse engineer any feature of a machine by saving it and searching in the save file for the controll key of the feature.Or look for hidden blocks by searching: <Scale x=""0"" y=""0"" z=""1"" /> and its variations.The Great Guide on Particle GeneratorsA big with guide on a glitch-weapon class, written with scientific depth and detailednessLevitation through Vector EntanglementThis guide introduces a revolutionary building mechanic that makes building stable aircraft ridiculously easy.And if you made it all the way down here, Just buy the damn game, it costs hardly anything at all and is absolutely amazing.

								Basically:This game is awesome. but it is not for everybody.It is the most open-ended engineering and building game in the market by a massive stretch, and when you add in modding, the possibilities are literally endless. if you are an imaginative person who loves thinking about building stuff - and whatever stuff tbh cause you are guaranteed to be able to make it - then you need this game. The levels are pretty unique and really well designed - the game is very well balanced as well (unless you mod, which is fun in other ways), and the Devs are really good at keeping the game interesting, be it with new blocks or levels, but honestly you can keep it interesting by yourself by just building more stuff. Once you really get into the game and learn how everything works, stuff gets more fun, and the more you play, the better it gets because you become a much more able engineer. This is one of the only games i can say just keeps getting better the more you play it. not to mention, the community is awesome, and some people are insane when it comes to steam workshop creations. And remember - this game is still only early access. The incoming multiplayer update is going to revolutionise the game, and undoubtedly for the better. With 95% recommended reviews and a cost of about 7 bucks, there is really no way you can go wrong. I have read some of the negative reviews, and some are outdated, but some have reasonable points, though most acknowledge it is actually a pretty good game in some way. Despite this, with 95% recommended reviews and a cost of about 5 bucks, there is really no way you can go wrong.PS: you kinda feel like the bad guy, and it is really cool to be able to not be a hero and just end up destroying everything insteadFinal judgement: Just get it.

								My first creation in this game was a small vehicle covered in cannons and flamethrowers.  It worked fine, but by the time I got to the fourth level, I needed some protection and a way to dispatch the wall in front of me.  So, I countered that wall with a wall of my own, covered in armor plates and cannons.  When I fired it, it blasted the opposing wall apart and was sent flying backwards from the recoil and rolled (surprisingly harmlessly) over my vehicle, which I then drove around the flaming wreckage of the wall to destroy the rest of everything.  When I got to the iron stealing level, I dropped the vehicle entirely and went with a cannon turret which knocked the ore balls into the target zone from afar.  Since then, I've mostly been trying to find ways to complete every objective with pretty much cannons only.  What I'm saying is, buy this game and use cannons for everything.			"

								A nice and simple, yet satisfying game. Have played for around 5 hours now and I mustay it is great. It makes you think outside the box, made me repeatedly rebuild my contraptions. Loving the art work, the physics are great.The camera is quite annoying, it is quite easy to control, but you sometimes can't see a certain spot you want to. Lack of levels, I know it is justa indie game, but 5 more levels per island would be nice.Co-op or multiplauyer would be good too, have your friend build a base and you have to buld your contraption to destroy the target or move the logs.Overall, this is a great game and well worth the full price tag, but I would personally wait till they game is completed so you don't have to wait for more levels to be released.

								Besiege is an easy to learn, tough to master type of game. I've dumped many hours into building and fine-tuning my creations, and I have never gotten bored. The physics engine is pretty good, the destruction models are great, and the workshop integration really gives this game a great amount of depth. On the bad side, updates are slow to come, as is communication with the dev team, and the NPC animation is lackluster, practically non-existent.TL;DR, fantastic game, but don't expect weekly patches.

								I got this game quite a while ago, and at the time all that was on the Steam Workshop was catapults, cars, and walls of cannons. Now, there is tanks, machine guns, jetpacks, aircraft carriers, jets, mechs, hovercrafts, nukes..... The list goes on. So, to sum it up, great game, great graphics, and best of all... NUKES!!!!!!!!

								A fantastic game with tons of possibilities! I downloaded it way back when it wasn't even on Steam yet and I've been a loyal fan ever since. The aspect of creating your own machines is simply perfect. I'd like to see more frequent updates but I guess it takes a lot of time to do that.I can recommend this game to anybody who is creative and who likes to build their own machines. The game is well worth the money it costs.I can't wait to see new levels. Way to go Spiderling!			"

								Alright, time to list off the pros and cons.PROSCheap.WEAPONS!!!An option for blood and guts, so I can show it to my mom and not get grounded for 5 months.Killing armies. Woohoo!Killing peasants. WOOHOO!Killing farmers. WWOOOOHHOOOO!!Killing birds. WWWWOOOOOOOOHHHHOOOOOOOO!!!!Killing bulls. WWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!Burning houses.Blowing houses up.Smashing houses.Shredding houses.Driving through houses.Smashing castles.Blowing castles up.Driving through castle.Smashing random crap.Blowing up random crap.Driving over and through random crap.A planned multiplayer update! This might make me lose a couple hundred friends, even though I don't have that much, but who cares? Well, I sort of do.Puzzles.Use your imagination for great good fun and evil!If your imagination is as sucky as mine (which isn't possible, really), then you can get some great machines from the workshop!Change the keybinds for certain blocks!Change the blocks' strength, speed, etc.Get mods!Get skins!Physics!Okay, I cut the pros a little short, but that's because I had do do the cons as well, which take me a while to figure out. Here they are.Physics.You can't drag blocks.You can't resize blocks.Seriously. Two cons and so many pros that I can't count, but maybe it's because I never went to school. I can count to five, though! Also, to make wheels that turn, you need to put steering hinges or steering blocks before the wheels and maybe flip them to get it to work. Little tip that took me a bit to figure out. Too bad I can't recommend the game multiple times. I'll just break the rules and write a bunch of reviews on different accounts, each recommending it.  That'll cost a lot of money, though. Still worth it! That was a joke, just so you know. About the multiple accounts. Is it even breaking the rules, though...?P.S. I haven't had Besiege very long, and I have schoolwork and school to worry about, so my time on it may be low, but realize I've had this for like five days and I'm up to 27.2 hours. This is a morning, too, so I haven't played it yet today. Just realized I needed to add this.			"

								In its current EA state, this game is incredibly short. Even if you try to make new builds for every level, but you really don't have to do that. There are basically three to four builds necessary: a catapult, a grinder, a collector, and a small racer (for one level). Artwork is fantastic and music is very appropriate. Looks like there are lots of plans for expansion from the main menu. The physics sandbox feels great and building is really fun and easy. Lots of room for creativity and different ways to solve the same problem.Totally worth a few bucks.			"

								One of the few games that makes you feel stupid in a good way.It's far more fun to fluke a level by the dying thrashing of one very broken machine than it is to construct the perfect killing machine.Who doesn't love the idea of vaguely controlling a shambling, rapidly disintegrating machine with 10 spinning blades, 6 flamethrowers and enough canons to tear it's own head off.It may be early access but what is there works perfectly and you'll happily play levels over again.

								As a standalone / vanilla game I'd give this game an 8.5/10. Building is easy to start doing, and as you get more advanced possibilities of creations are endless. The levels are all amazing, and it's fun to try to rebeat all the levels with different creations. The only reason I wouldn't give the vanilla game a 10/10 is because the modding community is what makes this game a 10/10. Don't get me wrong its a ton of fun without mods, but there are completely endless possibilities with mods. I started out making catapults and cars and hovercraft and other fun stuff. But when I installed a few building mods, it opened up a whole new domain of what could be done with this game. I'm not that gifted at building myself, but I've seen some crazy stuff like transformers, sniper defense mini games, trains, super realistic functioning models of battleships, the stuff you can do in this game is jawdropping. It's worth the $8.00 just to build in vanilla, but with mods its even more of a deal. "

								Ok. Let me make it clear. If you have a little money left and dont know what to do with it, buy this. It's a great game. Now that the 'Multiverse' Update is coming which introduces Multiplayer, I can't be more excited about it. The game runs even on low end computers, like macbooks, but if you want to play it with larger creations you need a better PC. So the more blocks are placed in-game, the more CPU and RAM it takes, makes sense...As a RLE (Real-Life-Example), I have got the game on both my main PC and laptop, so I can enjoy the works of 'Spiderling Studios'.Sayed in short, it is a VERY cost-effective game title to own in your library.

								Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is fun.I started off not knowing what the hell I was doing. I built some horrible broken mechanical demon that couldn't even destroy the house in the first level. Until I put a bunch of cannons on it. I named it ""Abomination"" and left it to rot. Shortly afterwards, I created some prototype vehicles, and didn't get very far with those either. At this point, I was getting bored. Then I had an idea.Cannons. Many, many, many cannons. Filling up the entire frame of the construct, low and high, fit to tear apart almost any building that stood in my way. My first true creation. I christened it 'Godslayer'. Over a short period of time, I worked to improve it. Godslayer V2 had wheels and suspension, V3 had spikes, blades, and even more cannons. V4 was fitted with plows and flamethrowers, but sacrificed some of the raw cannonpower, and V5, the current version, had reduced recoil and two large catapults containing bombs at the back. A true master piece in my eyes. And yet, I had grown tired of it. As my experience with the game grew, so did my need for more complex machinery.And so I sought to create more machines. At this stage I made something called 'Sorta works'. I don't know what it is or what I was attempting to make, but I was not pleased with the outcome. After that, I made a prototype Ballista, which was made to fire a long block of wood with a spike at the front towards the target. It only worked half the time, so I abandoned it and got to work on something a touch more complex.It started with nothing but a large array of pistons in a line with a spike on the end, which would extend forwards and poke whatever was infront of it. I was pleased with it, but I saw plenty of room for improvement. Version 2 had wheels, a cannon, and a contractable spring to stabilize the pistons. V3 had a working catapult and even more cannons, aligned so that they would reach over cannons in front when the pistons were active. The current version, V4, made the catapult piston based so that its range could be altered, cannons were added and keybindings were altered to make the machine easier and more convinient to use, and spinning blades were added to the front to evicerate whoever decides to stand in front of it. This unstoppable amalgamation of wood and steel proceeded to tear apart buildings, evicerate armies, and flatten fortresses with relative ease. It isn't perfect or impressive by any means, but it is a creation that I am proud of, and may continue to build upon. Truly, this game is fantastic. Even with the limited resources there is a huge variety of things to create. The updates may come slowly, but they will come. Buy it while it's cheap so you can get to destroying buildings with a phallus-shaped mechanical monstrosity. Which I have also done. "

You can try to create something big and powerful to do many great things or go small and compact to see what suprizes awaits you. Would definitely recommend this game, its so creative and i love the physics engine. Not much slowness or lag either. Enjoy every bits and bobbs of it! :)			"

								The freedom of creativity in the game fantastic. I mean, if you want to destroy some farmers, their homes and their chickens for instance, you can. The sheer capacity for destruction and murder that this game enables is amazing, and if that wasnt good enough for you you sadistic F***, you can also do it in zero gravity and watch the victims of your brutal contraptions, be it chicken or human or sheep, explode in red mist as they float in a completely helpless state.10/10 would partake in physics-based homicide again			"

								Incredibly cute artstyle, very much freedom in building anything you want to, pretty challenging as well!Rather than how most games of that genre force you to use a set of blocks to make something, you just get everything and the challenge actually exists in trying to build something for the current situation.Would be nice to be able to download solutions from other people to at least try solving a level you're stuck on with something solvable, but other than that, I really have nothing negative to say! :)			"

								Besiege can be adequately described as the best and most limitless creativity toy around. It's, as you can probably already tell, a medieval-styled Crazy Machines with unlimited parts and well... medieval objectives.Why settle with a Trebuchet though if you can take to the skies in a Da-Vinci-like flying machine just to rain down fire on the enemy? Build a giant chariot with sawblades like in the trailer and watch your foes crumble and be gored to perfection, and if there is any true siege work on castles to be done, you can always deliver explosives right to the enemy's doorstep. How? Your way!Be wary of your amazing contraption taking fire though, those cannons and blades are going to be hard to use when your machine falls apart into ashes. Armour provides proof against hazards like oil pots, arrow fire and gouts of flames, but with the main part of your contraption made of reinforced plywood and medieval acceleration at it's finest/weakest, it's going to slow you down quite a bit.The Scenatios only restrict you in how big your vehicle/tower/plane/gun platform/glider/paradropper or hybrid can be and if you already completed a level, you can switch off this restriction at any point for unlimited siegecraft.I also must say that the game is very hardware-friendly and performs well for a freeform physics sandbox. Add to all that the spectacle on which you are probably most likely (I hope so for you) is served at an absolute bargain price and getting updated regularly, I only have one question to ask to you, dear reader:Why are you NOT playing this game right now?

								Best value for money I think I've ever had from ANY game. Don't let those hours played fool you, I've had much more 'no-life' than that playing Besiege. And those hrs have been quality good fun gaming. ;)I'm not 100% sure, but I don't think any other game has made me, or does make me laugh harder than Besiege does. From igniting a spinning chicken to yak lobbing, it just seems to get funnier - ofc the caveat being you need a warped sense of humour and a little creative thinking to begin with, but aye, burning, drilling, and smashing a yak or just driving up and shooting a knight point blank in the face (with a missile) never seems to get old.It goes like this at 1st - spend 2hrs creating a masterpiece of destruction and mayhem, hit 'start simulation' and watch as said masterpiece self-destructs creating a huge mass of shrapnel that flies toward the intended target destroying it anyway and completing the level. Win. :)At the price, if this looks like your kind of game - then it propably is!Once you're comfortable with building stuff, go to the Besiege (SpiderlingGames) forums and DL 'Spaar's ModLoader' and TesseractCat's 'Editor+ Mod' (thanks you guys!) Edit: And the 'No Bounds' mod by ITR (awesome)And a last note - the progress isn't exactly speedy, but every update does add days more fun just not usually in an overt fashion - new blocks etc.EA or not - great value for money IMHO.

								I only have around 30 mins put into this game, but after having watched Robbaz build a village burning Corgi, I can certainly reccomend this fine game.As for the serious review...Did you play with legos as a kid? Maybe you were the one tearing everyone's masterpiece down. That's irrelevant, this game is for you.Aside from a few wonkey default key binds,(rebindable) Besieged is a great sandbox, physics based game. With a great and somewhat addicting Bridge Constructor like level layout.As for the value of buying the game in early access goes, the answer is yes. This game has no game breaking bugs and is being regularly developed. I could only imagine the price going up as it exists early access.			"

								I don't often buy indie games. I decided to splurge. In my country with terrible exhcange rates even 7 bucks amounts to 130 times that amount. Which is a lot. But holy cow 7 bucks well spent. This game is extremely good looking. It is absolutely fantastic. The building is so simple and easy to understand, but the physics is realistic enough to frustrate you and force you to build realistic machines. Don't get me even started on the aesthetics. Dang this game is beautiful. Sometimes I just look at it. Its just nice to look at. Anyway buy this game if you like fun. And you like fun that looks beautiful. This is bascially why indie games are so much better than mainstream stuff.			"

								Besiege is a fun puzzle/contraption building game.  It has a lot of unique pieces to build your creations from.The level design is nice and eases you into addtional features as the levels progress.  It takes some times lots of trial and error to figure out what works and what does not.  There are a few interface options i wish they would add, such as removing ""chunks"" of parts rather than indivdual ones, when you just need to make a section a little bit taller/smaller, ect.Overall all  i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys thinking and problem sovling.  The added physics can help create a very dynamic contraptions.  There is a ton of replay value as you could run through the levels over and over again with different creations and beat the levels multiple ways.  I did a Let's Play through the beggining of the game and goes over the basic ideas and concepts.

								Right now, Besiege is a game I would recommend. It is fun to spend hours building the perfect machine to pass levels or to build the most ridiculous thing in sandbox mode and sharing it with friends. The game is still early access though. It is still rough around some edges. Sandbox mode needs to be expanded so that you can place NPCs and structures where you want, there needs to be a camera option that doesn't follow the center of gravity of a creation (this is especially true when a creation blows up and the camera goes everywhere but where you want it to be. This makes it hard to take cool screenshots.), some of the in game settings won't apply when they are selected (I'm looking at you, tooltips), and some other really minor things that border of gripes. Despite the roughness, Besiege is worth every penny. I haven't had so much fun building death machines since Little Big Planet. In a way, this game feels like a medieval Little Big Planet with how it plays, which is a huge positive for me at least. I'll tell you the same thing I've told my friends, buy this game asap. I give the early access build of Besiege an 8/10. I can only see this score increasing in the future. tl;dr 8/10 buy this game			"

								Review for Besiege:(TL;DR Pick this game up, it's totally worth the price.)Pros:1. The replayability is fantastic. After you finish a zone it gives you your stats. You have the ability to go back and change your machine and try a different approach.2. The zones themselves make you think and is a real challenge when you pick the game up. When I mean challenge, I don't mean difficulty. Again, it makes you think and it brings a nice sense of accomplishment everytime you finish a zone.3.  The game looks amazing. The shadows are well done, and the artwork/design of the game is beautiful. They did a fantastic job with the games appearance.4. While the items they give you to build with don't seem like much, the things you can create are infinite. Go look at what the ♥♥♥♥♥ community did/videos or pictures of what people build. Its crazy.5. The tools they give you help at greatly with your machine(s). You get to screw around with the properties, get to see how many blocks you currently have on your machine, and even the centre of mass which helps out immensely when trying to figure out how to get the weight to be stable.Cons:1. The amount of zones currently of this review is a little small, but then again its early access so I don't expect a complete game at all.2. Camera can be a little wonky, but the reset button is there for a reason and It doesn't ruin the enjoyment at all when I was playing.3. Learning how to make machines can get a little complicated at first but you get the hang of it after a little while.Other than that I really haven't seen anything wrong with the game. It's a very well built game. You may get stumped when trying to make complicated machines, but getting the reward of seeing it work is very satisfying.Final Verdict: 9.0/10 Very well built game. I recommend it for anyone who likes building games. Im very excited for the new zones and I will be playing this game for quite a while.			"

								I was curious about the game ever since I saw the .gifThe physics of it are very realistic. There's a lot of freedom to be creative: mobile killing machines, flying machines raining down descrution, siege weapons firing explosives, etc. Plus there area  lot of awesome things you can download from the workshop.It does take a bit to learn what everything does, and I think a tutorial would really help - so I'd recommend just horsing around for awhile and trying to use each part (to get used to what it can do).

Early Access Review
								ALPHA V0.04As always I was weary of an Early Acces title, but I had been looking for a game like Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts (hey, it was good in it's own right) and after reading the Early Acces thingy I was convinced for two reasons: they promised variety in levels aestethics and gameplay and they promised to always deliver a price proportionate to the content. So I bought this in it's earliest form, so I could eventually enjoy all of the content at the cheapest price. And to be honest, I was surprised by how robust this V0.04 alpha already is. The mechanics feel very near completion. My only problem is the lack of actual levels, but for 7 bucks this game is worth your money. And if they deliver upon their promises this game will eventually be worth way more than the 7 bucks you paid for it.If you're into building vehicles with physics and driving them around, this game's just the best there is. Even at this stage it's a blast, and that's at version 0.04. I can only imagine what this game will be like in a year from now.			"

								Besiege is an awesome game with an awesome community. I can't really build very good, although I beat all levels of the current campaign with my own creations. The really great thing about Besiege is its community. There is a huge variety of builds in the Workshop, from classic Catapults to modded Hovercars. There also is a great modding community, which has made some awesome mods (one is a mulitplayer mod), like the Rocket Flamethrower mod and camera enhancement mods. I would fully recommend buying it, you cant do anything wrong for $5 ;)			"

								The game is awesome.. i really like that the maps are really well designed and big , you shouldn't worry about space. There  are missions of all kind (Destroy,kill,deliver,steal) , it would be nice if they make ""protect"" missions also. At first i thought the game would be easy to play , but after that ... :) This game is making me feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There are some strange things like ""sliders , pistons , ejectors , water pumps e.t.c"" If you are thinking ""Should i buy it?"" Yes , you should , it's really fun. It would be awesome if they add CO-OP campaign or Multiplayer PVP 9/11- The ♥♥♥♥ing tutorial , should explain more..			"

								PLEASE READ WARNING AT THE END.Here are the basic details from my experiences in the game:-There are levels, albeit not many and it's been over a year since I have bought the game and I have noticed that they have introduced a new sandbox and the empty sandbox among various bugfixes, but no new levels, so dont go in expecting a fully fledged ""campaign"" so all in all you get a small campagin that may take you an hour or two, maybe even less to complete and you get 3 sandboxes to mess around in, the old sandbox, new sandbox and the barren expanse (empty sandbox).-You build siege machines, planes, airships, tanks, etc. If you have an idea for a killing machine, then you can most probably build it in Beseige. -Workshop content is a lot of fun to play with, especially hillclimbers and off road vehicles.-The building system can be quite a learning curve, especially when you try and build a flying machine.-Graphics are nice to look at, no complaints.-Game is quite cheap and you can squeeze quite a few hours out of it.Overall, for $9.99 I cant really complain. If you enjoy games that allow you to create various machines/vehicles, buy Besiege. It's a small game with not a lot of content as of yet but to be honest building is where you will spend most of your time.WARNING: Unless you have a ♥♥♥♥ing beast of a PC, I do not recommend you buy this game. I originally had this game on my laptop, it ran, but when creating medium sized machines the FPS would hit around 15-20. I built a gaming rig 2 months back, its pretty high end to be honest yet when I try to build a big machine or try to load a player created machine that has a decent amount of parts, the game goes down to like 10 FPS, coompletley unplayable and it takes away from the creation factor. I want to build and play big machines but I cannot because for some reason my high end PC cannot handle it, maybe the game is just terribly optimized, I can run all new games flawlessly bar this one. I know the game is in early access, but come on, its been over a year since its initial release.If not for the low FPS issue I would give this game a 9/10, I enjoy it, but this one issue ruins it for me so I cant help but give this game 6/10 (in its current state).
