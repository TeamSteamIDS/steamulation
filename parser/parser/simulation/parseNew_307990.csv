												Sorry if this review is late but steam is glitching up for me at the moment. Wildlife Park 2 Fantasy is a small EP that is worth the $1 price (if your a fan of this game). this pack contains two types of animals, dragons and unicorns. This is where the pack becomes a little bit disapointing where there is simply a lack of other fantastical creatures such as; ogres, trolls, imps and other creatures based around mythology. Overall this pack will please fans of this game and delivers a new idea that is never before seen in zoo simulators.			"

												after a few hours my park took a turn for the worse so i decided to buy two dragons to mate. as soon as i bought them i realised the unicorn enclosure wasnt strong enough and  they escaped and ate all the workers... so i was 3mil in debt with two dragons on the loose.			"

												Well now since the previous problem was fixed, I am a happy customer. I really appreciate the quick response from those high up. It means a lot to me and, Im sure the community as well. I would now recommend this game to anyone, this game is a lot of fun and is way better than ZT.			"

												Friend bought me this as a joke, honestly he wasted his money.Its quite clearly a DLC but it isn't marked as one, and as such comes with no instructions so when you chose freeplay your clueless as on how to startdon't buy it, it isn't a stand alone even though it doesn't require the original game			"

												I got this game from a ♥♥♥♥♥ slaying attack helicopter. It is pretty good.I enslaved some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥unicorns and gave them numbers rather than real names because i think Hitlers methods were effective. I also gave them a handyman named James because he is gay and likes to play with drill tools. Unfortunately for my zoo's visitors my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥horses died within a few minutes because of thirst. I imagine they were glad that they died because of being around James so much as he is a welsh individual who would probably shag them for the rest of eternity if they had immortality. Overall id say this game is pretty good. I rate 9/11.			"

												It seemed like a good idea at first.But then things turned for the worst.This product was deemed too fantastic by the public, and the government was forced to shut it down. This game was the only thing that kept me alive, and they tried to take it away from me. I've been in hiding for the past two years, and they still haven't found me yet.I'm at risk right now but I need to warn youThis game is the best game imaginable, and if you are safe from the government please play this game.Just know that you are at a high risk of being exposed to extremely good media.You have been warned			"

												Okay, so since I'd seen from previous reviews that the dragons would be expensive, I'd started my park with a lot more funds than I usually would've. I didn't require a tutorial because I'd played all the other expansions, and I've gotten to tenth generation Fire Dragons so far. I guess I find this more interesting than other users because I've always been more focused on breeding than doing Missions.			"

												I agree with most of the people in the comments this game should be labled as a DLC because with no tutorials or any guident the game is nearly impossable to play.By looking at my account it looks like I have spent a while on this game in all truth I have only played it for 20 minuits. :P			"

												Ever had that dream about running an wildlife park with 2 kinds of ''fantasy'' animals an unicorn and a dragon? NO me neither but you can experience it in WIldlife park 2 fantasy ... a worthy ''standalone'' from the popular wildlife park series. Lots of fun prob if you buy the full game ... =)			"

												This is not really so much a game as a DLC for a larger game. Sadly, with only this pack you really cant enjoy the game as a whole and i wasnt even able to figure out how it worked since i had so few creatures to use. Negative review because it should have been more clear about needing some larger product. as for what it would be like with that larger product? i can only guess.			"
