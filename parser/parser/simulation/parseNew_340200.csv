												Bloop is goop you got to get into a receptacle... by the use of gravity and lines. That's the problem and the solutions can be devious and fiendish even. Especially when the game doesn't register your solution as you completing the level, that's fun.			"

			Bloop PC Gameplay [60FPS] http://store.steampowered.com/app/340200/ Subscribe to see more: http://bit.ly/seph_au Focus on steam games, indies and early access. No nonsense.		

Basic yet somewhat interesting 'story', easy to learn controls and surprisingly good soundtrack, which ranges from chill jazz to piano melodies. Progressing through 42 levels will gradually introduce new game mechanics and just in case that doesn't sound like enough content it also includes a level editor. If you are a fan of puzzle games, particularly the 'bridge builders', Bloop is worth a second look at.  Should keep you entertained for quite a few hours. Cheers.			"

Bloop is a pretty good puzzle game which might seem basic at first glance, but quickly becomes accessible to only die-hard puzzle fans who don’t mind spending a lot of time on a single level. It features a lot of content for a low price and has nice physics and a big challenge, however, it’s kind of annoying that you can’t skip levels at all if you’re stuck on one.			"

												Nice puzzle game, gets pretty difficult and time-consuming after about 6 levels, and there's 42 of them so you can expect to get much playtime out of this. It's extremely cheap as well, so definitely worth your money if you like puzzle. It seems to me that there is no correct way to solve these puzzles; anything goes and experimentation gets you a long way.			"

												Bloop is a quirky little physics based puzzle game, that isn't the first of its kind, but will most definitely not be the last, so what makes this little game so interesting? Let's dive in and find out.Gameplay: 83/100 B-Nothing revolutionary here, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. What Bloop lacks in innovation, it more than makes up for it with a polish in gameplay. It's not perfect and some levels are a bit of a pain to figure out, but they're not impossible, in fact, they're clever and often times will require the player to think outside of the box. It's a simple game, very few controls and a handful of concepts to master, but like any good puzzle game, it has a nice balance between simplicity and complexity.Audio: 92/100 A-Some folks might think I'm giving this game a little too high a score for the audio, but I'm a sucker for good sound development, but even more for jazzy/lounge soundtracks and Bloop is filled with it along with other tracks, but they are never distracting or overwhelming, taking away from your concentration. If the soundtrack was available to buy, I would most definitely buy it. Aside from that, the game's effects aren't anything unique, but like the gameplay, is well made.Visuals: 84/100 B-Speaking of distractions, the visuals are a bit messy. I don't mean it in a bad way, it's cool looking and full of little gags that made me giggle like a schoolgirl, but the faded watercolor look sometimes drew my attention away from the problem I was trying to solve (Or was that just Borderlands 2 vying for my attention again?). Anyways, back on point, Bloop isn't bad to look at all, the colors are all nice and the shapes and stylings are, well - bloopy.Content: 75/100 CThere isn't really much here to talk about besides the gradual progression of puzzles and difficulty. You probably won't be blasting through the game in an hour or even two, but once you get done with it, that's kinda it. It's a good time killer, but once spent, it won't do much for you, so you're better off sharing it and letting others try it out.Design: 77/100 C+One of Bloop's selling points is it's organic and physics based puzzles, that said, this involves a good portion of open world problem solving, involving you the player to create your own solutions more or less, within the bounds of the stage in the form of number of moves, or pieces you can use. The game could definitely benefit some small zoom option, but it's really nitpicking. It does what it needs to do.Performance: 79/100 C-This would definitely be higher if it wasn't for the simple fact that on the highest resolution, this simple game seemed to lag on my computer. I couldn't figure it out. Of course on the lowest resolution, it was smooth as butter, but a bit harder to read. Overall, the game ran just fine. There isn't much you can really tweak and outside of the resolution, the other options didn't seem to affect the games performance by much.Verdict: 82/100 B-Bloop is nice. Bloop is friendly. Bloop isn't hateful. Bloop is just Bloop. It's a fun game for the most part and while it may only be worth one or two playthroughs per person, it is definitely a game you should give to another person, especially as a way to introduce someone to the physics based puzzler.

												Fun puzzle game. Your main goal for all 42 puzzles is to get the liquid from the source to the target flask. There are different mechanics. Sometimes you only have a limited amount or length of lines you can draw. Or there are fancy boxes who work a little like magnets. Or there are those evil sawblades.The levels are not too hard to solve, but getting them to 100% is not easy.I can recommend it, if you get it on sale or in a bundle. The only bad thing about this game: no achievements, no trading cards.			"

												It looked like a nice puzzle game, but it's not much of a puzzle because of the bad physics: you just draw some lines, cross your fingers and hope that the physics will work in your favor, which can be really stressful sometimes. There were some cases where I would replay the exact same solution multiple times and each time it would yield a different result. I had to lower the resolution for a few levels to work properly, and the controls can also be a bit unresponsive sometimes.			"

The game has both challenging and unique puzzles that will keep you rattling your brain. Also comes with a level editor but no Steam Workshop support yet.

												Cannot recommend!The game is super buggy - it takes me multiple loads just to get it to load and let me into puzzles to play.  I get strange errors when I close the game, and often need to close the game from Task Manager.Bugs aside... the idea behind this game is good, but the puzzles are poorly designed... the ""flow"" (not of liquid) of the puzzles is clunky... often to complete a level you need to trap some liquid and solve one liquid color independently, then use the ""Bloop Mechanic"" to untrap the other liquid to solve its puzzle parts.If this developer would fix the bugs, and hire a good puzzle level designer - and perhaps include much more tutorial... this could be a good game.I'm afraid as it is... the game is rubbish.  Don't buy - not even on sale!			"

												Bloop is a really neat physics-based puzzle game in which you place platforms in an effort to guide liquids to their jars. There are also various obstacles and mechanics that you encounter and have to overcome, such as pendulums, elevators, etc. The art style is minimalistic, yet aesthetically pleasing, and suits the game quite well. To draw a comparison to another game, Bloop is sort of like Crayon Physics Deluxe, but with fluids instead of a rolling ball. Given the nature of this type of game, I feel that working with fluids, rather than a ball, allows for more flexibility and mechanical complexity (of which I am a fan of); the other side to this coin is that this causes a spike in difficulty that not all players will be able to appreciate. While I am a fan of difficult games, the quick spike in the transistion of difficulty between levels does cause a bit of frustration and can be a little off-putting at times. That being said, it isn't enough to turn me away from the game, just enough to cause me to take a break and come back later with even more determination.When I first started this game, I had a small and inconsistent problem regarding it crashing a few times. I posted a review that stated my problem so that potential buyers could be aware of this. Whithin a mere minutes of my post, the developer (a SINGLE person) messaged me on Steam, asking what the problem was, and offering to help resolve it (the problem was resolved). This is a developer that TRULY cares about his work and his audience. These are the type of developers that are saving the gaming industry, one game at a time.This game is enjoyable, difficult, and requires you to think outside the box, so to speak. I recommend this game to anybody who enjoys physics-based puzzle games that require deep and abstract thinking. The difficulty ramps up a little quicker than it probably should, but that's really my only gripe regarding this game. This gem belongs in any thinker's collection.			"

												The core idea of Bloop actually isn't that bad at all, even if it is nothing new whatsoever. You need to build a chain of bridges in order to fill some sort of liquid into a small bottle. While the first levels are surprisingly fun, the poor implementation of the more complicated mechanics is so terrible, so that it gets way too hard too early. I liked the basic idea of this game, but the poor realisation of the concept made me uninstall it after roughly 10 minutes.			"

There were problems loading, no way to get partial completion (even though the score is a percentage), and the levels went from too easy to too difficult within the first 5 levels. It's not much of a puzzle if the player is just drawing lines and hoping the goo physics work this time.			"

												It does look as an interesting physics game. Get fluid from A to B with maximum efficiency. The game, however is not appealing.The menu is unclear, the ""Play"" button is named ""Fun fun"", and the ""Exit"", is ""Blue Pill"" (watch Matrix if you want to know why). The menu song is one of the spaceside background songs from Kerbal Space Program. The intro ""cutscene"" was bugged the first time I ran the game, requiring me to kill the game process to try again. After going through a boring collage of pictures and scrolling lines of text, I was presented with the level selector screen. By the way, you have to double click a level to open it.I played up to level 4, so I can't talk much about the stability and/or glitches the gameplay may provide, but all-in-all, the game didn't caught my attention. For an indie game, it looks interesting but more work is required on it before receiving good grades. Maybe if this were released as an Early Access stage? It just doesn't look finished.Small pro: Made me want to play Kerbal now...			"

												I'm not really into physics games, but I had to try this out and give it a review.First of all, the game suffers from numerous technical issues. Sometimes the game doesn't start, cutscenes get stuck, alt-tabbing frequently crashes the game on windows 8. So you have to aware that there might (most likely) be some issues.Secondly, the game itself. Difficulty curve is not well laid out, the first few levels are too easy, then the game gets too hard very quickly. (as I said, I'm not a big fan of puzzle games, so that could be related to my missing experience in this particular genre) The game mechanics are very simple to learn, and each level has multiple solutions. The game is proud of that, but that makes the game feel strange. You never know if that is supposed to be a proper solution or some kind of workaround or glitch. The same goes about the behavior of lifts and other elements in the game. Even if you find a solution, it just won't feel right.Thirdly, the music and all sounds are just simply annoying. It makes you tear your ears out, and hang yourself. Yep, it's that boring. The art itself is somewhat similar to that too, generic, nothing special.Fourthly, the texts. Asides the few grammar and composition issues the texts are the worst part of the game. The author tried to be cute and funny so hard, that they became irritating. It's like ponies on fluffy clouds. Makes you want to kill yourself the second time after you hanged yourself because of the music. And the third time. The fourth time. The fifth...So in short, avoid the game.However, if you still want to try out a game from the developer, and you are interested in the concept, check out Bloop Reloaded. That's definitely a big improvement over this one.And there is something else I have to say here. I presonally don't like the idea of releasing a game, then release a better version as a separate purchase a few weeks later. I understand the circumstances of the releases (this version being stuck in greenlight for a long time), and that the products are separated by years of development. However I still think reloaded should have been free (or greatly discounted) for Bloop owners. ""The right thing to do.""			"

The text are slow and if you click your mouse the dialogue is skipped. You have to wait. Second, the graphic, is bad. Its simple, yes, but its bad too. It looks like its made up by a kid using Paint. Gameplay wise, I can't tell much as I only played the first two level. It's a liquid physics-based puzzle, much like the mobile hit Where's My Water. You just need to let the liquid to be inside the bottle, in which you have to draw some lines to make it happen. Not bad, but I've seen it in some mobile games.Single player, no multiplayer, no achievement, no trading cards, not worth it.			"

Music on the other hand is pretty Geddy Lee for the most part.Gameplay:I would say this game is the true Dark Souls II in terms of difficulty; FromSoftware needs to take some notes from these devs.Overall I would give it a Peep Beep Meme Creep/Newgrounds out of ten.

												Be what it is, Bloop is a fun and quite challenging puzzle game for your average gamer! A fun experience for you and who ever you decide to show it to, Bloop can be either fun or very frustrating. Launching the game was at first very complicated as it is not in a window meaning you can not re - position the window to do the settings The game does not even come with a configure tab via steam! Very dissapointing and sure to put you off of the game.Playing the game finally was really weird as it has very bad frame drop issues which for me just kills the gameplay! It seems no matter what PC you have it will be the same!Apart from that the game is quite fun and a little different from anything I have seen before.The pricing on the other hand is VERY strange. Ever seen the game called polarity? An excellent portal remake for those who do not have alot of money to spend on games so I have heard. I honestly would be ok with the two switching places :LAll in all I have mixed feelings for this game, but I must go with my heart and respectfully say my rating on it.Final Verdict:Do I recommend this game?No :LWhat would I rate the game out of 10?2.1/10Thanks for reading, and be sure to game on!

												Very basic puzzler.Basic graphics, with a bit of a story line.I won't give any spoilers, but there is a familiar twist - why? I have no idea, maybe the developers thought it would be interesting. I am not a puzzler freak, but my mind wanted me to continue on to find out what happens in the story.Some of the lines dont quite line up, and you end up missing liquids, losing those precious last bits.It will definitely keep the puzzle solving people busy.But if you are looking for great graphics, and eye popping HD content, look elsewhere. Yet simple, and easy to grasp.I score it as follows:Graphics: 3/10Playability: 6/10Story: 4/10so a total of 4.3/10			"

												Bloop is a physics puzzle game where you have to draw platforms so that liquid can come out of a faucet and flow along the platforms you created into a beaker. The levels aren't complete unless you can get a certain amount of liquid - ""Bloopies"", as they're called - inside that beaker, so you'd better make sure your platforms aren't an inch off of the beaker so that everything starts bouncing. After all, half of the game is physics!Unfortunately, Bloop is terribly presented and horribly optimized. These issues are extremely off-putting, and it's why, even though the game is kinda cute at times, I have to give a negative review and warn other users to spend their money elsewhere on puzzle games.First, the presentation. Bloop has an odd art style that I haven't seen much use of before. It's part abstract and part psychadelic. The colors are a little weird, the physics and motion of everything seems a little off, and it kinda made my head hurt to look at for too long. The soundtrack is immensely boring and will put you to sleep - not something that should happen during a puzzle game unless it's the puzzles themselves.Continuing on about the presentation, the puzzles themselves weren't too confusing, but those really annoying pop-up ""tutorials"" were less helpful than my own mind putting together what the ""Clear"" button does. When an abstract mechanic came along - namely, the elevators in puzzle 4 - those pop-ups did nothing but infuriate me because they wouldn't go away. I did read them, and they did not provide any helpful information as to how I was supposed to clear the level. I ended up ""rage-quitting"" at that 4th puzzle, simply because I just couldn't be bothered to figure it all out.Second, the optimization. Bloop is the only game where you have to double-click a level to play it rather than single-click. It threw me off for a good minute before I figured out what was going on. The framerate is terrible; I'm not going to say I was running a program that detects framerates, but the game was not running smoothly and seemed to almost freeze at times. I was running at 1920x1080, which other games have performed at with smooth as silk framerates. It's also worth mentioning here that a friend of mine was experiencing crashes when attempting to ALT+TAB, and could not even get past the introductory cutscene because the game would freeze at that point.Oh, and to skip cutscenes, I think the input is SPACE + LMB. Which is weird, considering I can skip the game's intro developer showcase (the thing before the main menu) with just the LMB. Coupled with the weird double-click for level select, I'm curious to know if Studio 2SD has played any PC games released in the past 5 years.I think some serious work needs to be done to this game before it can be considered a good puzzle game. Not to mention its short length, or at least what it seems like - the first three levels were not very in-depth, and only 42 levels makes this seem like a very short game. Regrettably, I cannot justify purchasing Bloop unless it's in a bundle. For 2D physics puzzles, there are probably much better alternatives.			"

												Bloop is a cute game with some well meaning designs. The problem is that it also has some aggrivating design flaws and has major stability problems. Bloop WILL crash to desktop A LOT. I spent about an hour struggling with this and I've thrown my hands into the air and uninstalled. This is the kind of quality i would expect from an ""early access"" game, but this is a full release. Crashing to desktop should never *ever* happen. Don't waste your time or money. If the developers can't take the time to release a stable product, you shouldn't spend the money to support them. Its harsh, but that is the reality. You are selling a product that should be worth buying. Bloop is NOT worth buying.			"

												Nikola Tesla,as he invented the electricity.As in real life,he wanted to share his invention to anyone,and make it free for anyone.He tested it,but it wasn't powerfull enough,so he added more power!So,because of too many energy,Bloop ""born"".He told to Tesla to bring him food.So that's what you're doing for the whole game,you're collecting food for BloopAs being said,this game is one of the worst games i've ever played.Cons: -The Tutorial-Animation from the begining (Nikola Tesla,who was standing in the same position,but his moustache,eye and eyebrows were ""dancing"" arroud)-Bad framerate-Story (Seriously?)-Instead of ""Quit"",you have ""Blue pill""Pros:-Price.Only the price.Don't buy it at full price.I managed and bought it for only 0.08$,which was nice.

												Whenever I first bought this game it looked like a simplistic physics puzzle game... and it is. However upon installing and playing the game I quickly realized that it was not worth the four dollars I had payed for it.-Negative First of all, the play button, instead of simply saying ""Play"" It says 'fun, fun, fun"" and in order to exit the game you have to press 'Blue Pill' instead of ""Exit"". I'm sure that this is a reference to something, but the title screen of a game is not the place to put references. Especially is the reference replaces the name of an important button. The creators should have put the refernces in the story or as images that blend well with the levels. How to start playing a level is also unclear. There is no mention of how to start the level, all you can do is experiment ( You start a level by double clicking, by the way  ). The opening story is also beyond bugged. It's completely broken. Images only appear half of the time, the text repeats its self sometimes or is completely out of order and sometimes the game just comletely crashes. It also seems like the creator does not know what the game will do. At about the third or fourth level 'elevators' are introduced and there is a text box that pops up saying that the elevators will move eventually. Making it seem like they did not know how often they made the elevators move. Not to mention that the game does not use the best grammar ( Which is just a pet peeve of mine, it is not anything game breaking, it would just make the game seem a lot nicer if it had good grammar.)  or that I had to restart the game four times just to get it to work.+PositiveOn the contrary, this game does have an interesting concept and could be good if they spent a little more time on it. For example, spend more time on bug fixing and proofreading the game and maybe even thinking a few of their original decisions over in order to try to make the game more 'user friendly'. I also like the name of the game. I hope to see some fixes in the future.			"

												This game is full of glitches. The opening ""cutscene"" had this glitch where I couldn't progress and the game crashed once during the brief period I played it. I recognised Kerbal Space Program music in here and what sounded like Gunpoint. Why use music from other games? It makes me wonder if the use of this music was permitted.The concept's pretty solid, but not nearly as fun as you might think. I got bored after two levels and I like puzzle and physics games. It feels like a game designed by someone in commerce to make a quick buck, rather than someone who had an idea and wanted to make something they loved, but that's just my impression.I wouldn't recommend this game even if it was fifty cents.

You draw a line where and make a connection between the pipe and the vial/vase/thing in the middle. Whenever you press start at the bottom left alot of fluid will be coming out of the pipe. The fluid/water/the blobs have to go inside of the vial thing in the middle. You keep doing this in every level.Game is buggy.Game is repetitive.Music is really bad.Bad Physics.There are 42 levels.Other things.Just avoid this game..-------------------I Give this game a 0/10			"

												Well, the game seems like a unique and fun puzzle game, but it glitched out on me three times so that I didn't beat a level after getting to 100%, so I'm done with it.Also, the first time I loaded it up, the intro story was all messed up. I don't even know how to describe it. It was like the cutscene had been gutted, and the parts were pouring all over the screen in a random fashion. Restarting fixed the problem.The puzzles themselves are interesting, though mildly tedious.  The glitches made the tedium boring rather than challenging, since I had to do the same levels over and over.Also... no achievements? Seems like that'd be a no brainer with a game like this.			"
