												After logging many hours on this game in the last two years, I finally decided to write a review. My taste in PC games mostly includes the strategy (especially turn based and pausable RTS) genre. I'm a fan of the X-Com Games, The Total War Series, Close Combat, etc. I played all of the Jagged Alliance Games and enjoyed them all. In my opinion, JABIA is a good game if you like this type of game; a game that requires a lot of management (inventory, strategy, assembling teams, et.). I found the planning and execution of my plans in this game a lot of fun. There are a few rough edges. They could have included a way to look at items ordered after you ordered them, as in the old JA Games. As it is now, you place the order and you have to remember what you ordered until it arrives and the only place it can arrive is at the Drassen Airport, requiring a lot of 'mule' trips by your mercs who will spend much of their time running back and forth for supplies and using newly hired mercs as mules when they come in. The end result of this is that I found myself spending much of my time organizing logistics for reenforcement and resupply. If, like me, you enjoy this in a game, then you won't mind it and may even have fun with it. If this kind of micro-management isn't to your taste, skip this game.The other part of the game is the tactical combat. This is done using a real time pausable system that requires many pauses and movement order updates during combat to be succesful (survive). With a small group of mercs (one or two teams of 6 each) it can be very exciting and great fun, but as the game goes on, and especially when you are getting ready for the final assaults on the enemy strongholds, you will probably have several dozen mercs going against hundreds of bad guys in just a few sectors. At this point the tactical combat becomes overwhelming as it is virtually impossible to be everywhere at once and are therefore forced to send a small group of mercs at a time against many enemies to whittle them down slowly, and it becomes a drawn out meat grinder of attrition. Not much sneaking around, tactical planning here. Just a whole bunch of shooting against very long odds. I think JA2 did much better by forcing the player, VIA limited finances and merc contracts, to run fewer teams and keep the game managable, while not requiring quite so many mercs to succesfully complete the game.  When you hire mercs in BIA, you pay the fee up front and they are yours for the whole campaign regardless of the length of time they work for you, and the money you find and earn in this game will easily run into the hundreds of thousands, so there is a balance issue here. Also, militia are pretty innafective, and when they die the weapons you equip them with dissapear. I found it much more effective, once you've been in the game for awhile to just leave teams of mercs within striking distance of primary towns and mines that you have captured and send them in when enemies try to attack. Mercs can move amazingly fast along roads and, as mentioned before, you'll have the money and therefore can afford the extra mercs to do the job.   Some things I really like about this game:-Friendly fire is a threat. This adds some realism that I welcome, especially with grenades and explosives. You don't have the automatic grenade placement of the new Xcom. ""Watch out for that tree branch...Hit the dirt!""-The strategic logistical and organizational planning and the tactical planning for each sector. A lot of fun here if you like that sort of thing.-The great fun of fast moving firefights once you get used to the interface, especially when the skirmishes are small.There are some annoying bugs and design flaws, a few of which are:-In close combat you can't shoot at an enemy when he gets close to you. You'll hear comments like ""Can't make the shot"" and your merc will just stand there as the enemy soldier cuts you to pieces, even if you have a pistol or SMG.-Unlike the other good games in this series, you can't repair any equipment but weapons. Body armor just takes damage until it's useless, and it is very expensive.-Sometimes when told to fire repeatedly at one target, your mercs will cycle through the count-down time for aiming, then cycle through again without firing. They seem to be able to do this indefinately so you have to watch them carefully.-When in a firefight, mercs are often forced into a kneeling position (frequently exposing themselves to enemy fire) when doing certain tasks, like first aid, clearing a weapon or disarming a mine. This also happens when you try to arm a LAW (Light Anti-tank Weapon). This unfortunate glitch will get you hit fast!-Game stops working occasionally for no apperent reason ('JABIA has stopped working'). This doesn't happen often, but just when you are about to win an intense twenty minute firefight, it's a bit annoying.NOTE: There is a very good mod that helps this game quite a bit called the ""Realistic Rebalancing Mod for Jagged Alliance - back in Action"" by KILLATOMATE. I highly recommend using this mod to help some balancing issues and decrease the frequency of some glitches within the game.As it is, I find this to be a very good game that has a lot of replayability. It's interesting to start off with various combinations of mercs to build different teams, then progress theough the game by taking areas of the map over in different order, etc. If they had taken a little more time and care in the development of this game, it could have been great.

												This is a very tenuous thumbs up.  The pause/realtime system was indeed a break & a daring experiement for the franchise, but I think it works.  I'm not one of those ""turn based purists"" who think anything else is blasphemy.  I'm fine with it, actually.The characters are familiar, and most of returning player expectations are met in that it delivers what it says on the book - a reboot of JA2 into a new game engine.  The same systems are all in play, and that's a good thing.  It's got your sector-by-sector conquer and consolidate, your cheesy dialogs and plenty of gun-fetish to go around.But it also falls flat in some areas.  Any real firearms enthusiast can find a hundred different flaws, errors and downright screw-ups in that equipment list.  The AI, both friendly and enemy, is questionable at best.  A lot of the light humor from JA2 has either turned dark or disappeared.  With the helicopter removed, supply logisitics are simply nightmarish, now.  Most offensive of all, Elliot is gone.However, all that being said... when I look at this game and compare it to all the increasingly horrible crap out there that tries to leech JAs name whilst simulataneously grinding that name into the mud... I find myself compelled to defend the easily superior quality of this product on general principle.The combat is still solid (usually), the tactics still interesting, the new problems that each town presents still challenging, and overall... yes, it's still fun.  Far from perfect, but fun.In short, it is not the best JA game out there, but at least I can say is really is a proper JA game and not some crappy knock-off and/or wannabe junk.  It may just be JA2's ugly brother, but it's still family.  That's more than I can say for the rest of the garbage out there.			"

												I'm a fan of the original JA games. This one started out ok, but turned into a disappointment way too quick.What I simply don't like in this one is the difficulty curve, or should I say the steep changes in enemy arsenal and numbers. First you're up against like six enemies equipped with machetes and revolvers. Next sector you're up against 20 guys with assault rifles and grenades. I mean... WHAT?! In the old JA games, there were never such differences between neighboring areas, save for late-game ones. Then there's the issue with very micromanage-y combat, hard to read environments (sometimes a branch of a tree blocks vision, other times a man-sized ventilation shaft offers zero protection) and clunky interface that by default assumes you want to keep queueing new actions to happen after old ones are complete, unless you manually clear old orders first. Every. Single. Time. Guns also can't be fired in melee range, apparently, and melee hits register still after the target is ten meters away.Lots of potential, but poor execution and lack of steady progression killed the fun for me way too quick. Can't recommend. Shame.			"

												I love the Jagged Aliance Series, but I don't get warm with this one.The graphics are good, the sound and look is ok, weapons and merc are good too. I mainly do not like the game because of the new combat system. The good old turn based combat system was great, this one feels just odd. I mean its not super bad, but it's just not what I want from such a game. Also I mustn't make my own merc, which is a big downer. Another thing is, that you can't repair your body armor like in the previous titles (not sure if they fixed this). Also inventory management is clunky. The ""story"" is also a rip off, of the old titles or pretty much a one to one copy, nothing new here, no imagination. I really wanted to like this game, but I just cannot.If its on sale for cheap you can give it a try, but its not worth more than 8€.			"

												I've tried time and time again to like this game. I install it, play it for a while, and every time I have to uninstall it because I'm so immensely frustrated at the shoddy mechanics. The camera is fine for everything but actually seeing what you're doing, and you need to point and click where you want characters to go based on the camera's view. Point and click, mind you, on any pixel in a large map with thousands of tiny variations in elevation which can mean the difference between spotting and shooting and enemy or being blinded by the tip of a mintue hill. You CONSTANTLY have to deal with adjusting your position so you're behind cover but still able to see and shoot the AI, who by the way, do not have to deal with ANY of what I've complained about so far.There are so many other small things I could complain about, but the above is what's making me vow to never play this again. Who would have thought a grid system would be make or break for this kind of game.On the plus side, I really like the idea of a plan and go tactics game.			"

												This review is for the Windows version. The MAC/Linux version is unplayable at this point.I am a fan of JA2 and i was quite disappointed when JABIA was released. It was unfinished and overpriced on release. But things have changed. Most of the game's problems can be fixed by using mods and the price of the game has decreased considerably. I played the modded Windows version for 220 hours and really enjoyed it. I can only recommend this game.The story/scheme of the game is very similar to JA2: You are hired to liberate a small 3rd world country and can only afford to send in a few wannabe mercenaries. You start to liberate/loot remote locations in order to get your hands on more money and better weapons while you recruit NPCs and improve their skills.In contrast to JA2 this game is in 3D and in real time. Which is awesome in my opinion. You dont have to watch 40 AI moves until it is your turn. You can pause and intervene at any time. The game offers a lot of freedom. You can run away from tough battles and come back later with better equipment. You can even leave the first battle of the game and explore instead.There are a few flaws, however:-Mercs have less character compared to JA2 and there is no option to create your own mercenary.-AI is just as stupid as in JA2 and attack squads are very predictable-Animations in this game feel like placeholders (all weapons have same reload animation and sound)-Annoying melee combat. Guns cannot be fired at melee range and melee hits damage all of your gear.-Explosives (C4) can only be placed on brittle walls. you cannot set traps for enemies.-You will spend a lot of time managing your inventory-Militia is not very useful and recruiting is tedious.-You cannot train/repair/heal on the strategical map (which was a nice feature in JA2)-Enemies cheat / have superhuman skill (fixed by mod)-Weapons are imbalanced and have wierd stats (fixed by mod)-Broken Stealth: enemies hear you walk/climb from up to 150m (fixed by mod)-Broken Camouflage: camouflage not working properly, especially at night (fixed by mod)People also complain about horrible aimtime in CQC, but this can be solved by using the Run stance (F3) at close range. This will result in rapid-fire instead of aimed-fire.Some reviewers claim that combat gameplay is ""micromanagy"" and ""tedious"". In my opinion combat is very simple and entertaining as long as you avoid common mistakes and use hotkeys. It is even possible to play the game completely in real time without any pausing as long as you know what you are doing.Watch the following gameplay videos and decide for yourself:

												It is such a shame that Jagged Alliance went on to be one of the most abused franchises in the gaming industry. By ""abused"" I mean that pretty much every release with the name JA slapped on it was a huge disappointment when compared to JA2 (on which I spent so many hours, I could've built a spaceship using only a spoon in that time).Anyway, let's talk about BIA.BIA is quite an awkward game. On one hand it's a fresh approach to the genre and the title, on the other hand it sometimes makes you want to pistol-whip the living daylights out of the developers.PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE MODDED VERSION (using either Combat Evolved or the Realistic Rebalancing Mod). The vanilla game will disappoint you. Plain and simple. The combat system. The combat system is in real-time, yet it can be paused at any moment, and orders can be queued to your soldiers. It's awkwardly good - it needs a lot of getting used to, but once you get a hang of it, you can use it to your advantage and it's fun. Still, sometimes combat gets confusing, mainly when you're attacking using multiple teams. The graphics. They're alright. They do the trick. Camera angles may get weird sometimes, but usually they're ok. Sounds. Pretty much the same as the graphics. The voiceover isn't great, but it's not a deal-breaker. Gameplay. It can get challenging, you'll get lots of gameplay hours out of it. The UI is ok, I've seen worse. Stability is ok, although the game has some tendencies to crash on you. What disappointed me a little was the lack of the lovely JA2 humour, with the Deidranna cutscenes missing altogether and other details not incorporated at all (like the florist website and many other things). BIA tries to take a more serious approach and fails, since humour was a big part of what made JA2 so much fun.The AI is a mixed bag, one fight they'll just run towards you and get mowed down, a few moments later they'll use cover and cause some serious trouble.I played BIA using both of the aforementioned mods (in two separate gameplays, of course) and it was fun. They fixed a lot of issues, brought in tons of new guns and modifications, Combat Evolved also gave you access to a lot of old friends from JA2.So, do I recommend this game?Yes, as long as you mod it. You miss out on a lot playing the vanilla game.The modded version gives you a touch of good ol' Sir Tech JA2, so if you're a long-time fan, don't even bother playing BIA straight out of the box.Of all the other JA clones or ""remakes"" out there, this is probably the best one.

												I still dont understand why so many JA fans didnt like this game.I loved it and finished it 3 x now.While it is not turn-based, you can pause the combat and give orders, which is huge.I thought the graphics were excellent and the story (as well as the map) recreates the original faithfully.Since it's release, I have been pretty sad at the fan reviews because even though this company made a short sequel (not all that great in story comparatively), I dont think a true sequel will be made due to the negativity....which is sad in my opinion.Anyway, I highly recommend this game and I have played JA since the original release. I love RPGs and squad based games and I love this game.One last recommedation. If you do wind up buyign this game (and you should if you like these sort of games), definitely download the mod: Combat Evolved. It does an AMAZING job!!!			"

												First I was positively surprised with the game. It looks really good, the locations are very detailed and allow us to engage combat in different ways. The combat system itself was changed from the original one. Fights run in real time but the player has an active pause option which can be used to give order to your mercaneries. There's also plenty of equipment and weapons to use. Whats also a pros is the fact that the game is sometimes funny. Some items descriptions can put a smile on you face. Unfortunately, in some aspects game was simplified against the original JA2. After passing a week in ingame time I was sure that I would have to prolong the contracst with hired mercaneries ( as it had to be done in the original game). Surprisingly you dont have to do it anymore. Player needs to pay the mercanery once and doesnt have to worry about prolonging contracst ( Despite the fact that ingame mercanery company statute describes the detailes of prolonging the contracts! ). This is a terrible solution which makes the game far too easy. In origninal JA2 money was a major problem and you had to think a lot how to hire new meraneries and have enough money to prolong the contracts. This made the game a real challange. Right now its just a casual, easy to play production. All because of this silly decision, which for me makes the game unplayable. The simplification is also visiable in the aspecst of characters development. Original system was uniqe and iteresting, you could train your mercs in different ways. Now you only spends random points after reaching the next level... Also new the militia traning system is silly and far worse then the one used before. To sum up, Im dissapointed and I can't reccomend this game to die hard fans of old Jagged Alliance games. Although this production could be interesting to players new to the series who dont like too chalenging games.			"

												I am 50+ hours into this game, and I mean to complete it.After going through all the mixed reviews for this game, I decided to wait for a sale and try it out. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. IF you're expecting some sort of revolutionary (or evolutionary) successor in the JA franchise, you're going to be disappointed. Back In Action is not that -- it's a re-envisioned, updated version of Jagged Alliance 2, with the ultimate aim of liberating Arulco from Deidrianna. Graphics are now 3D, and the game engine is ""real-time"" but combat can be paused for you to issue orders/commands. The nice thing about this system is that you can simultaneously coordinate attacks from different entry points, create overlapping fields of fire, ambush enemies stealthily with a knife, etc.Some things have been simplified too: you only pay for your merc once. Militia recruitment is simplified (all you need is to arm them). And you cannot create your own character (this was fun in the original JA2, but I'm not convinced absolutely essential).The game focuses mainly on combat. In JA2 it was turn based, here, it's real-time with pausing enabled. Sight lines and physics seem ok. Can things go wrong? Of course. Just as they do in real life. So pay no mind to those who expect their tactics and plans to be executed perfectly. But that's part of the realism, and to me, the appeal of this JA title. Some things I didn't like: no helo transport (am going everywhere on foot, which is a pain) thus far, no ETA for my online orders at Drassen, no crafting of special items, inability to repair anything except weapons (though this can be thought of as realism I guess -- how can your merc repair everything from guns to knives to armor? Seriously?).Still I paid $11 for this title when on sale, got 2 extra DLC mission packs, and some mediocre firearms in some other packs. Based on that, I'm going to recommend this game. Get it when it's on sale. It's really quite fun!6.5/10.0			"

												This is a ""Plan & Go"" style, squad size command, RTS game using the Jagged Alliance theme. If you are good at people/logistic management, you will enjoy this game.There are a lot of game reviews on Steam that breakdown and list the flaws of the game and make comparison to other similar games; but these are for the 'control freaks' who have failed to realise that just like in the real world, things are never perfect.If you just accept the flaws of the game (imperfect game rules), play and plan strategy according to the game rules, overcome the problems as you encounter them, ...you will do well in this game.

												In many ways this game is an improvement on Jagged Alliance 2. Besides the obvious graphics updates, the pausable-real-time combat engine works well, and the 3D map layouts provide both challenges and opportunities. Figuring out how to assault a road block or clear out a building is quite rewarding.What really kills the game is that everything besides the combat is extremely tedious. Managing inventory, amor, militia and your mercs should be a pleasant change of pace between combat, but running around buying a gun and then figuring out which door you need to open so that you can give it to a militiaman is more trouble than it's worth. The little cutscenes from JA2 - corny as they were - also appear to be missing, so the game feels almost bereft of plot or character.After a couple of dozen hours, I've liberated just under half of Arulco, but I feel like I've already experienced everything the game has to offer.

												I was always more of an X-COM/UFO fan than a JA fan. I like the pause-and-go of the UFO series for example. The most enjoyable feature for me is squad management - assigning roles and weapons, planning an approach and then executing the plan. Seeing your mercs storm a building from two sides and take down the hostiles inside in a perfectly coordinated assault is incredibly satisfying. JA:BiA does squad management really well - not as fluid and rewarding as the latest XCOM, but with all of the detailed management of equipment that the latter left out.I'm a bit annoyed by the repetition though (clearing the same area over and over again), but in general this game is very enjoyable.

												Terrible game:1. Enemy snipers standing upright and being more accurate than your prone snipers with the same weapon.2. Enemies running through doors that were closed infront of them.3. Missing four times in a row on a ""very likely"" with good morale is not a freak occurance.4. Grenade launcher grenades (and regular ones) can explode right in your face if you try to shoot them outside of ""your reach"".4.1. Your AI will gladly destroy your whole team if you leave an AI with a grenade launcher and guard mode active.4.2. The damn thing is useless most of the time because you can't arch it enough to hit anything behind anything highter than a thigh high wall.4.3. Your AI will waste ammo firing on a long dead enemy, this also goes for grenade launchers, so disarm that moron before you advance with your nearby troops.5. Not being able to save mid-battle until you have disengaged the enemy.5.1. The combat autosave is useless and is more likely to put you in an unwinnable situation, than it is to be of any use.5.2. Reloading save games can glitch people through ladders and into houses.5.3. Auto saves sometimes drop you right into combat without pausing the game.5.4. Reloading saves will almost always make that one character that can't stand another one ♥♥♥♥♥.6. AI allies on guard will shoot each other in the back just to get that low health stun-locked enemy standing right infront of another ally.7. Sightlines are a mess, and there is no real way to tell if an ground level enemy will be able to see your soldier crawling in the middle of a roof.			"

												This could have been a great game. It had the potential to be a worthy successor to the excellent JA1 and JA2 games of our youth. Nice graphics, a decent combat system. Unfortunately, it seems they never really got round to finishing the game. It's like they cut a load of corners, spent too much time designing junk items (like a wide variety of t-shirts and food items), didn't properly test it, rushed it to market and then started on the DLC cashgrab as soon as they could.A few gripes and missing features :There's several really annoying bugs (for example, items in sector inventory will disappear randomly and only reappear if you save and reload). Gameplay is unbalanced - expect to face off against skilled, well-armed enemies with your two or three pistol-wielding mercs pretty early on. If you move into an occupied sector, expect to be dumped right next to the enemy forces - you need to move next to the danger area and manually enter the zone if you want to try any kind of stealthy approach.There are cars and lorries all over the landscape but none of them are usable. Forget about quick transport between locations.Explosives can only be used at specific weak points in walls so forget about making your own entrance to a building. You'll often find locks that can't be picked or forced. You can't shoot locks or blow up doors. Mercs and militia will happily jump on landmines, even when they've been detected. There's no autopause when a mine is detected, either, so if you're sending a merc through a potentially mined area, do so carefully.The militia system has been horribly simplified. Rather than go through the tedium of vetting recruits and teaching them to use guns, why not just hand that random person on the street, potentially violent prisoner in a locked cell or hospital patient found in a locked ward an assault rifle? What could possibly go wrong?Only one weapon attachment is allowed at a time and is removed if you change weapons. Want a silencer, laser sight and fancy optics on that gun? Forget it. Want to switch to another gun when your inventory is full? Drop something first.Shooting an enemy will interrupt and stun them (fine, that's a good idea) yet hitting them with a baseball bat or machete doesn't, allowing the enemy a chance to beat the snot out of your merc.IMP no longer exists. Forget about making your own merc.Enjoyed those witty interactions between mercs or those cutscenes of Deidranna abusing her staff in JA2? Interesting, well-written dialogue with NPCs? You won't find them here. By the time you're storming the palace you'll just want the game to be over and done with.Conclusion : Meh. Don't bother. Unless it's really, really cheap in a sale.			"

												This is a worse version of the origion Jaggad alliance 2 which it is based on. There where so many small things which I dident  like and in some regards where worse than the original. First of is the thing I like the most which the original. The characters. They are like cheap imitations of the originals. The voice acting is not realy that good and where are the cool comments and the intriges between the diffrent characters. Where are M.E.R.C? >_< Then we have real time combat whicj is all fine except that the enemy AI is quite bad and the pause funtion only work when it feels like it. The most important thing is that you could sett it so you paused the game when a character is finish with its actions, which is important if you storm a city with 18 mercs. But this never worked for some reason. So I had to pause the game frequently to se that all was doing something. Then it is the tactical map. They try to show that if 2 armies meet that you zoom in on the map and the look on the map depends on where you was on the tactial map. But this is fake. They already was special sectors put on the map and you go ito the one you are in. Also the enemy that comes to attack the towns you have secured always tkes the same route  and attack the same towns. After a while I noticed this and only fortified that town. You can also ""cheat"" for ex. If you want to get away or intercept some enemy coming on the tactical map. You can just go into combt mode runt the the end of the screen and go back into the tactical map go for a short while so you come inte the next sector and then zoom in and do the same. This makes your trvel go much faster and you mercs do not get as tired. :D. Also if you are about to storm a fort and you think there are a bit to many enemies you can if you find a good spot do this. For ex. At one place I found that they had 2-3 guards at a gate a bit far from the others so I stod near it zoomd into combat mode killed them, zoom out and then zoomed in again and there where 3 more guards. I did this for a while and after some time they stoped to have guards there but then I had killed like 15 of 30 enemies in the area. ^^ Then we have that yo cant train militia which is fine but why must I go into combat mode and run to talk to them to give them weapons, why not just be able to do that on the tactical screen?. Many things are more simple like the medical stuff where you dont need to treat wounds extra on the tactical map. Lastly where are the humor. I loved the humor with the queen, Eliot, M.E.R.C and many more characters which is laking in this game. The orignal is one of my favorit game of all time and I dont think this lived up to it. :( But I liked playing it anyway.			"

												Long-waited revival of Jagged Alliance experience in full 3 dimensions. Jagged Alliance 2, simply put, is the king of the small, but proud sub-genre of strategies, namely, a squad-based tactical wargames. JA Back in Action is the 3d re-vision of classical JA2, with new engine based on real-time action with commanding pause mode. To my regret, I wasn’t impressed with that cover-version, so I’m not gonna persuade you to buy it. Game’s decent, even engaging sometimes, but really not that much as original JA2. Even with the all downsides that original Jagged Alliance 2 have, it is still a much better game than its remake Back in Action.Short audition of features:1) 3d view works fine enough, but I can’t say same thing about control above the camera view. Due to real-time gaming pattern, I often was in the not-so-fun position where I can see neither enemies, nor my own soldiers in the middle of the shootout. Somebody’s shooting, but who? On whom? It was not obvious way too often. The biggest throw-down of the given 3D engine is not a bad camera, though. It is very limited destructibility. You have plenty of C4 there, but you only allowed blowing certain points at every sector. You can’t even open closed door with the shotgun!2) All controls are giving the feeling that developers were in need to invent a wheel anew. Or at least, a bicycle. Even moving a map from side to side with the sliding of mouse was added after some patches. And when you‘ll make yourself familiar with the basic controls, you’ll still be wandering with some “decisions” about user interface. Like management of your mercs in teams, or management of inventory of taken sectors.3) Smart pause mode itself is good, comparing only with the best examples in the genre. But crude AI behavior and sometimes ridiculous camera makes that modus not so desirable, so to say. It is still a good option, but not the essential, like in games on Apeiron engine (7.62, Marauder) or even in the Dragon Age titles.4) AI of the enemies… they shoot precisely, even with the weakest of weapons, but instead of taking the advantage of those superb skills, they always tend to rush forward, by the shortest path available. And they don’t give much attention to the dead bodies of their comrades, if they don’t heard a shot or seen the shooter. In short, they are quite dumb. There are several maps in the game, where some additional rules were added to enemies behavior, and it is there you’ll probably meet some troubles, and get an urge to plan something ahead. 3-4 serious fights in the whole game, I’d say it’s not enough, but that’s me. Someone likes easy games, and the majority of games now are making for those casual players. So take a hint: buy some PSG-1 rifles and collimators, to shoot far and precise enough, and quite fast at the same time. With those rifles you’ll be having the upper hand almost in every situation that game has for you.By the way! The AI of guards you’re hiring for defending your sectors… it’s the same as with soldiers, but even worse! They don’t use any tactical advantages of the defending position; they just rush on the bullets! And, unlike the Jagged Alliance 2, you can’t just hire new guards via global map. You need to get some guns, go to the sector where the fight with Deidranna forces was, arm manually each new volunteer… And if he dies, he won’t leave his gun on the body, you need to find or buy a new one. So you need to participate in every fight by yourself, and it will be faster that way.I can keep up with that list, but that’s major things: the game went in 3D, but became much plainer in the process, if we compare it with the vanilla Jagged Alliance 2. Back In Action took almost everything that wasn’t so necessary and fun, like over-pompious music themes, and constant transitions of items between sectors. A 3D perspective is not bad to have, and smart pause mode can be tolerable. But illogical and un-informative camera views, clumsy controls and blunt behavior of any opponents are not giving the taste of satisfaction even when you prevail above them.Take me right, I’m not thinking that the Jagged Alliance is a perfect game, even if I’m calling it the king of the tactical genre. Were it up to me, I’d cut or remade some features from it as well, and all that constant fuss with the inventory items, which need to fix, optimize, transfer from sector to sector, from drop zone to battle lines – in the first hand. I’d add some really fitting and atmospheric music to the background, just to fight the urge to fell asleep over the keyboard, while I’m planning another phase of ongoing war conflict. And to think more of it… Maybe the most challenging thing that was made under the brand of Jagged Alliance was not that 2nd game we’re so much talking about? Maybe it is the add-on to the first Jagged Alliance, the Deadly Games? There you have a line of separated missions for your squad of mercs. You have one map, where you fixing all your tasks, and after it, that’s all, you’re victorious! It feels much more refined, than questionable economic system of the JA2 game. The developers of Back In Action thought in that direction as well. They made two DLC with such maps, in every case you have some quest to get in somewhere and kill there somebody, via some sub-stages on the way. Sadly, but both of those DLC’s are just shown how amateur those developers are. There are different reasons for this conclusion, but hear this: in the mission Shades of Red you need to storm some embassy where hostages are being held. The developers make the several ways to get to that embassy, and the cleverest one was from the basement, which you can penetrate via sewerage tunnel. That way you don’t need to dodge the rockets, which the insurgents will be shooting in case of direct assault. But, but, but… In the end the devs decided it is not good for balance, so now you can’t get to embassy via tunnel. You see it from one end near the river, you can get there with a C4 blast through the wall. But you can’t go further to the tunnel. After you storm the embassy in the hardest, direct assault way, you get down to the basement, and then you see another end of that tunnel, and you realizing, how far Back In Action from the real complete state. Even now, after 3 years after release, with all after-market fixes, like adding the possibility to use mouse to move the map… it is still far from complete, not only in the DLC maps, but in the major game as well.Finally, so many words after, a conclusion: you CAN buy the Back In Action, if you have a thing for tactical games. It is not a bad game; it is playable and sometimes even brings some fun!I’ll mark it 6.5/10. It looks good, it sounds and feels almost like old-good Jagged Alliance. Simple-sized for newer, casual players (who can forgot to reload gun between getting into the fights, for example) – but still you controlling a team of mercs, and still you’re in the lead of private war going in the colorful little Latin country. You may find many mods, honing the improvements Back In Action made to Jagged Alliance franchise. There are not so many games in the genre, after all, and Back In Action is certainly not in the worst part of that list.			"

												Avoid this game. I'm a big enough fan of the original Jagged Alliance 2 game that I can overlook this one's oh-so-many flaws, but Back in Action simply isn't worth buying. Maybe in several months when they're done patching the oh-so-many bugs and missing features (if they're trying to make this a Jagged Alliance game, anyways; this is a glorified knock-off that the Drassen sweat shop kids would be beaten for producing), then and only then will this be worth it. But I'm not sure it'll get patched, so right now it's a nostalgic paperweight.			"

												One of those games you really _want_ to like.But just can't.JABIA really has a couple of nice ideas and the general gameplay:You have a squad (or more than one later on), fight over the isle in mosty real time and free the cities and camps to overthrow the evil queen... What could go wrong? => Well, unfortunately, the devil lays in the detail. While the game itself might entertain quite a bit, there are so so many small issues, that they kinda sum up to leech the fun out of the game.* Controls: Are never thorougly explained, I had to look them up in the www as lots of key, that make the game easier to control, are never shown anywhere in the game. Even worse: you cannot change them!* Graphics is pretty ok in general. FPS sometimes go down in bigger cities, but not as much as it becomes unplayable. But unfotunately you cannot zoom out as much as you want, making snipering a game of scrolling around.* Mico-Management. Usually I like realistig micro management. But in this game you have to literally open every single item stack, remember which is which to change weapons etc. until you cleared an area (only then you can drop around freely - ONLY those you opened so far, however).* Music: Gets boring. Fast. Like really really fast: turned it off while still in the first area.* UI: Does not scale (or is just always tiny?), nor be resized. Also several, seemingly minor, but still annoying issues, like you cannot compare your currently equipped stuff while opening an item stack. You can only compare that to your carried equipment. What to compare weapon? Unequip first, put in carry slot, then open item stack again - reverse afterwards. Same goes for other stuff, like interchanging equipment between squad members.Also several stuff is not displayed (like weapon accuracy), so if you're not a weapon enthusiast, it's often hard to decide which one is better.* AI: Just stupid. SOO stupid. Sometimes stays around while under fire. Sometimes turning around weirdly. Sometimes hits with a pistol my sniper several times although he is half a km away, and cannot hit him, although it says ""very likely to hit"". They vision cones are awfully small. But sometimes they spot you while crouching below a tree at night, from 100m afar. * Bugs - and this is really bad, as I played the game late, like >3 years after reloase, so I guess no bugfixes anymore:** Achievements came up pretty weird: First 2 areas were fine, then some appeared which I definetely did not trigger, while others appeared later or never. Like ""Layed 100mines"" came randomly after throwing a grenade. And BEFORE the ""Layed first mine"" one O.ô** Sometimes mines did not trigger at all** Or my guys just did not shoot. Gave the order, aim was fine, enemy did not spot them yet and stand still. Nothing. Only level reload sometimes helped.** Weird stuff like you cannot lay mines everywhere you want. Making them useless most of the time.** .....Well, would-be great game, if they'd spend more love on the details.Would-be.			"

												I have got so much enjoyment out of this game that I really would owe it a more thorough review, but I'll settle for a few thoughts for now.In my opinion the contemporary reviews were as bad as they were because of the initial lack of the fog of war. That's been taken care of ages ago and that completely changed the game for the better, at least for me.I see many people still hate it, but honestly I don't know why. The stop & go system works very well, and actually I think it's superior and less artificial as the traditional turn based system. And yes, I played the original JA in the 90's as it came out and enjoyed it, but I enjoy this even far more.As for the bugs and crashing, I really haven't encountered anything nearly game breaking, only a few minor annoyances. As for complaints of the game being too difficult unless you skip regions - simply not true. It can be difficult at times if you don't know what you're doing, but all the more satisfying when you finally do.So here's my lazy effort for a game that has brought so much entertainment to me. The bottom line: Thumbs up!			"

												This is not an easy game, so if you are a casual gamer or impatient, pass on this one. Remember that you are a part of a STRUGGLING rebel group trying to overthrow a goverment, so expect it to be difficult to kill hundreds of soldiers with a couple squads of 6 or less mercs(though you can have multiple squads in the same location, you'll just have to tab between them). As a fan of strategy games, I can say that this game does have an unusually steep difficulty curve, but not an impossible one. You can expect to lose and replace squad members(unless you're a fan of copious saving and reloading), and you may have to retreat a few times, but with the right prep work a single mid-level merc can take out a squad of 15 without taking a hit. You MUST have a strategy in mind before moving in, and you must learn to be flexible. As the in-game time progresses, locations receive more and more reinforcements, so you must act quickly to secure a few early and get your daily income up to otherwise the entire game will be an uphill battle. Arming the locals is crucial, unless you leave some mercs behind to defend against the ai squads which is a good idea in a few locations. For those who say this game is too hard, I would be happy to write a strategy guide(not a walkthrough), but only if someone comments that they would like one, not going to spend the time if no-one is going to read it.

												I really enjoyed JA Back in Action. However it does have its flaws. The game starts off awesome, with your 1 or 2 mercs tactically taking out bad guys, using stealth and flanking. It's great! But after capturing a few areas, the enemies quickly become OP, with machine guns and snipers, heavy armour and they can spot you from miles away. Flanking and stealth doesn't really work any more if you pump an entire clip into an enemy and they still don't die..... Plus, if you do manage to kill them, they drop crappy items! Maybe a couple of $$ and some crappy pistol ammo. Ummmm what happened to all the gear you were carrying Mr. Dead Bad Guy?Because of this, I started a new game 3 times and lost motivation each time I reached that point in the game, never going any further because it wasn't much fun.HOWEVER! Using the Realistic Rebalancing Mod, it fixes all that and more! After getting this mod, I finally had fun and finished the game. My only flaw now would be the level design in some of the later levels isn't as good as the starting levels. A lot of big open spaces where long range weapons and high marksmanship stats are all that matter.I would definitely recommend JA Back in Action, as the first few levels will definitely get you hooked. And if you want to improve the game balance, just simply use the Realistic Rebalancing Mod.			"

												All round Good tactical squad level combat game with some quest elements. Uses a plan and go simultaneous Wego system, and you can switch to realtime with pausing as required. Easy to coordinate attacks with all your squad mates. I have played this game 3 times and logged more than 311  hours to date and I know this game well. The environment is open, so you can stop anywhere on the map, although the scripted action takes place in dozens of marked locations on the map such as towns, hideouts, sam sites, mines etc. Lots of weapon types. Clothing is camo rated. Towns have militias you can arm.Not perfect tho. Explosives are there but redundant. Fancy Shotguns come too late. I don't use body armour as it falls apart too fast, don't need it. Only one attachment per weapon, although I'm happy with a scope. 3D environment is nice but camera is a little restrictive. But hey there are some mods that resolve the balance issues. And the Nags are minor. All that aside, the plan and go engine works well. Play the tutorial to get the most out of it. I like this game better than 7.62 and Xcom. I want a full sequel!			"

												The good Old Jagged Alliance is Back in Action! Well maybe not old, but definetly Jagged Aliance, and for sure back in action. The changes include 3D view, a nice graphical firework, and real time option with active pause. I might be biased about this, since that's why I bought the game, yet those are two great ideas.  Not so good ideas include, RPG elements are only elements.  Managing statistics of your men is all what you get. Dialogues mean choice between accept mission, and leave, no matter how many lines has the character to say. And last but not least, you don't have to pay salary to the mercenaries. Once hired, it's service for life. Not that this makes the game easier, but does not feel like commanding mercenary army anymore. And you can't create your own merc. All in all, if you loved Jagged Alliance, give JABiA a try, if you would like to play Jagged Alliance, but the old mechanics is somethig you can't stand, this game is a must!			"

Before you buy it, watch the gameplay video, or even download the demo. The gameplay is the major factor for your decision to buy it or not.The pausing/unpausing battle system may remind you the Baldur's gate battle system but it doesn't feel as polished and may get frustrating some times.I would prefer the simple and efficient turnbased system that ja2 had instead of pausing in the middle of the battle, doing mundane tasks over and over and ruining the feeling of immersion in the battle, but that is my personal opinion. Others may like the tactical approach of the battle.The game gets negative reviews cause there are people that don't like the way the battle system was implemented and there are people that try to compare this to ja2. This is an entirely different approach to the jagged alliance universe from the approach the ja2 had and the developers didn't try to make a new version of ja2, but an entirely new game.You could compare the change in gameplay from ja2 to ja bia to that from Fallout 2 to Fallout tactics, but Fallout Tactics doesn't have mixed reviews cause it has both turnbased and rts options, both well implemented, and you can choose to play it the way you like it.Another negative factor is the existence of bugs and balance issues that can be fixed by community mods, but you have to download them and install them manually instead of fixing them with an official patch or from the workshop.TLDR: If you like the gameplay video, get this! If you prefer the old turnbased battle system don't get this! "

												(BEAT THE GAME YEARS AGO OFF STEAM, GOING AT IT AGAIN!)If you're a fan of JA 1 and 2, you NEED to at least try this game.Don't pay the nay-sayers any heed, this is a GREAT game, especially if you use the Realistic Rebalancing Mod. This is sort of a community patch, changing some broken weapons and buggy systems for the greater good.http://www.moddb.com/mods/realistic-rebalancing-modBasically, it's JA2's story. The government coup, payed for by a handful of diamonds late at night on the streets of prague. Dedrianna is still the main antagonist, though the cinematics featuring her and Elliot (idiot!) are missing.You do NOT have a personal avatar this time around, instead you hire starting mercenaries with a small starting fund. It's about enough to get three beginner mercs with basic armaments. You'll see a lot of familiar faces in the merc roster, but they have a lot less personality than previous titles. The UI is a rather drab green colour, and there is less exposition in this game. Each merc only needs to be payed a one-time, flat rate for their contract. No repeated costs. For balance reasons, mercs are now very expensive.To make up for the lack of flair, BIA features a more streamlined combat and logistics system. There is only one airstrip, just north of drassen. You capture it straight away, and can start ordering guns and mercs in the first day with little difficulty. Shipping weapons and items to the front-lines can be done by one merc, and is a simple task. Though you may find it taking quite a while to arm up, this should come as no surprise to vets of the series. Capturing an area will leave any items discovered during battle in the item section of that area on the world map. No need to run around grabbing stuff.Recruiting NPC militia is a little more annoying this time around. You have to actually run about in the map to each recruit, and hand them a gun. You can use the area inventory for this, or your character's personal inventory. It's annoying, but this makes it so you can have some pretty serious militia. If you leave just one merc in the area to help out with combat, a well-armed militia can make short work of anyone attempting to re-capture your towns. Upgrading the militia's skills is done from the world map, just click on the town or house or whatever, and you get a simple menu at the bottom left for progressively more expensive level-ups.There are some hiccups with the combat system. Controls seem a little janky, as far as contemporary tactics games go. You need to manually enable auto-attack (guard) mode for your mercs at the start of every battle. Otherwise, they'll sit around yelling at you while they get helplessly massacred. Panning around the scene will prevent you from using buttons to change stance and such, and the queue-based command system that BIA uses during the Pause screen in combat can be tough to get used to. If you take the time to learn to use it though, you'll find each fight works itself out a lot faster than JA2 combat ever did. This can make easier battles fly by in a devestating hail of gunfire, instead of a protracted hour-long clickfest.BIA doesn't let you zoom out as far as I would like, but you can zoom the camera down with the mousewheel, and view the combat from a sort of soldier's-eye view. This is good for longer-range engagements, and looks pretty cool.The Rebalancing Mod adds some extra weapons, there's a pretty decent number of available guns in the game with that installed. They're all reasonably well balanced, and combat is a brain-over-brawn affair. You need to have really good unit placement and firing lines to be successful, especially when your enemy finally starts getting high powered rifles and body armor. Saving when you're in combat is impossible, so you can't cheese the shot rolls. It's a good way of doing it, as the game will auto-save every time you get spotted by the enemy. You can easily retry an engagement, and since the combat is so fast-paced, this really doesn't seem to be that big of a pain.The entire map seems to be rendered in 3d, so if you encounter an enemy patrol in the middle of nowhere, you will fight in a forest or desert just like in JA2. That being said, the 3d world battle map is surprisingly small. You may find that starting combat in a field will also include the nearby town, and you'll end up on the side of a HUGE combat map. Approach direction, and party location is very important for starting battles. You can easily place your squad in a specific street or courtyard using the world map, and then wait for the enemy to step into your auto-battle range. It's a really nice feature that works very well for multi-squad engagements, and planned attack missions. Want to approach from the west side of the village because it's got no sandbag walls? Load the game back to the map and circle around!Really, seriously consider giving this game a go. Right now it's non-sale price is $15 USD. There is a LOT of fun to be had here for that price.			"

												It is considered bad business, when attempting to do a remake/sequel of a product, ignore what was it's most shining qualities. Jagged Alliance 2 was known for it's turn-based strategy, degree of micromanagement that rewarded those with a shred finanical planning with a bigger margin of error, and memorable characters with very unique voices and facial graphics. Jagged Alliance 2 was a shining example from the old era of games, when PCs could only go so far on graphics and had to focus on the actual depth of the game. This is a facet that some Indie Companies are returning to. So now we come to the ""remake"" of Jagged Alliance 2, Jagged Alliance 2: Back in Action.I acquired this game by an Ebay sale, for $10, and still feel that I got ripped off. I have tried to play this game, wanting to love it cause of it's heritage, in which I spent long hours with Jagged Alliance 2. However, this so-called 'Innovative' Plan-N-Go function is not only a slap in the face to what was a main fun point of JA2, but is clunky in it's own execution. Plan-N-Go is not innovative. It isn't really 'Turn-Based'. All it is, is just Pausable Real-Time, with a very obtuse method of programming in moves. It creates a situation however where you have to pause constantly, as no planned tactics really go according to plan. Why the developers ignored the fans, who didn't want this development, I simply will not understand.The characters are..bland. The facial graphics are horrid, the voice acting is just horrible, and how this new game can do WORSE in this area, from it's decade old original just outright boggles me.The music is good. Very good, so good I wish I could extract the music files and then just delete the game and be done with it.Graphics? Yes, it has pretty graphics. Then again, so do all other games out now from big bucks studios. Pretty graphics is no longer a selling point, as many gamers are actually turning away from games that brag about graphics as they realize these games have just graphics..and nothing else. JA: BiA is a good example of this.The DLC focus and the sudden expansion hint at the companies own realization that they released a stinker of a game with very limited shelf life. Their content release, with attached price-tags, show they aren't really proud of this game and are looking to just cash in as soon as possible before a better version is released.Should you buy this game? Only if the price drops below that of a 16 oz. Pepsi. But spend your money on the Pepsi instead, as you'll get more enjoyment out of it. Pirate this game. The developers don't deserve a single penny. Money should be given for good products, not handed over to people who push out a horrible product, and laugh when you expect some actual quality for your investment.I am hoping the developers of Jagged Alliance: Flashback look at this game, and see within it, a tale on what NOT to do.

												This is an excellent tactical game, much better than it's reputation. In fact I would argue that, while flawed, this is one of the best tactical engines ever made. This game also feels like a ""real Jagged alliance"", and this comes from someone who played the originals when they were first released.Unfortunately a lot of JA fans who have their heads stuck on that is ""has to be turn-based"" in order to be a ""real JA"" whined like little girls about this wonderful engine being pausable real time. That earned the game a bad rep and it didn't sell well. Too bad because that meant we never got a proper sequel and a sequel to this game would have been amazing. The irony is that if it had not been a JA game it would have been hailed as one of the great tactical games ever, but instead we got narrow-minded whining and the developers gave up on the engine.It's not perfect, there are flaws and annoying details, that's why my heart bleeds that we'll never see a proper sequel, but that does not change the fact that this is one of the most detailed and innovative hybrid tactical games ever. Still recommended today in 2015, the graphics are a bit dated now of course, but it's an intensely enjoyable game and there are some good mods to make it better (it's also really easy to adjust things yourself by editing text files). Highly recommended. At the time of this writing I have 530 hours sunk into this game.If you like this kind of game, don't miss JABIA just because of whiney old-school fans who can't see beyond ""turn based"".			"

												Personally I really like this game. There are a few things that should be changed and or fixed to make the game more polished. The A.I. is kinda stupid at times, and at others seemingly clairvoiant. The inventory management system could be better, but it has some pretty awesome features. This is a RPG RTS, and I have been hooked.			"

												I'm going to be honest, my first time playing this. I always pushed it aside thinking it was just another remake. Maybe they added stuff, added characters, added scenes. So I finally got curious and decided to give the game a try. After two hours of gameplay and freeing the airport and finding Ira (who ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, sounds a lot worse.) I decided it isn't a remake, this game is nothing more than a crummy reboot that didn't work out. All this game accoplished was made me want to play JA2 and thats about it. And they didn't add stuff in fact they took stuff out.It just falls short of what the original was. It's kind of like a kid acting like it's father, yeah it's cute...but stop it.			"

												I love the original even though it was a bit old when I played it. Graphics were poor and the controls and many interfaces were clunky. I was overjoyed to spot this update in a shop recently and just had to buy it. Afterall, all they had to do was to modernise it and it would be pretty much perfect. The hard bit that many other games fail on, the GAMEPLAY, was perfect. Turns out that the people behind this new thing decided to change the thing that made this game so special in the first place and change it into just another overhead RTS where reactions are more important than brains.Very disappointing. I'm going to find the original again.			"

												I've played the first mission now and I'm more than disappointed... I'm angry! Pros:+ it looks nice+ Tactical mode would work well, if not influenced by other stuff, you will read below...+ sneaking seems to work wellContras:- Controls! What the F***?! Why do I need to press ALT to rotate the camera? Why can't I use the middle mouse button like in every other game? Or another example: you would except to enter the main menu by pressing ESC, guess what... nothing happens. ridiculous- You can't change controls. You can't look up the controls. have to play the tutorial- Action Queue. So, I spottet an enemy and emtpy the queue (press clear all in tactical mode AND the stop button on the right side) but my mercs just folow there last move command before acting like I want them to.- Graphics bug in the UI when I click buttons on the right side in tactical mode- Game is telling me that my merc can hit a target but keeps shooting at the edge of a wall and get killed by the enemy...- Achievements don't work.- Missing NPCs. 2 Years and there are sill gamebreaking bugs in it?Well, I could life with most of these bugs, but the controls are just so horrible I can't enjoy the game. I mean what is the point in having nice 3D graphics if you struggle to look around/change perspective just because you don't wan't to f*** around with a super sensitive, inverted(!!!) keyboard/mouse combination.

												I do not recomment this if you liked any of the previous games.What's good:-The music is catchy but not annoying.-The camoflage mechanic makes sense but is barely working in hiding a merc that is in the enemies vision cone.Instead of using one type of camoflage like in the old games you wear different clothes with different camoflage colours that add up to a cumulative percentage.-The online shop is available right away and has unlimited stock for each item a day which makes equiping a squad.What's bad:-No SELF MADE MERC.Unless you use an editor to change a pre existing Merc you won't be able to make your own out of ""Balancing Issues"".-No proper tutorial.-Blatant crippling streamlining.  *Weapons can't be pre build anymore. No different Ammo types, only 1 type of attachment and no preloading weapons unless they were once equipped and reloaded. Attachments also take up a slot in your inventory once you change weapons and have to be reattached.  *The Map and Menues are so simplyfied that they turned useless.  *Squad management is not explained and barely there.  *Training, Sleeping and support roles like Medica Care and Item Fixing are gone. Only weapons can be repaired once by one.  *Severely reduced controls.No wire clippers for fences, No shooting of easy Locks, no grabing of guns out of enemies hands, no shooting of civilians or NPCs, NO USE OF C4 ON ANYTHING OTHER THEN WALLS THAT ARE CRACKED AND HAVE A GREEN SPOT ON THEM.NO DESTRUCTABLE TERAIN, FENCES or NORMAL WALLS.Appart from that NPCs seem to always have the better Aim and perception even with inferior Weapons.On Normal DifficultyAs a sample: Scope with 100 Marksman and Sniper Rifle expert perk armed with an ANTI MATTER RIFLE and 12xScope wasn't able to kill a person wearing a Helmet with a headshot.A weapon that should DESTROY anyone that gets hit.On a different note the same merc couldn't hit a Target that was WELL in range eventhough it sayd ""Certain to Hit"" while the target was able to shoot and nearly kill her with a Sub Machine Gun.This shows bad balancing.For a tip:Get grenades and Launchers. Using grenades on enemies around corners to flush them out is the only propper way to get rid of them since even expert mercs with 100 Marksman Skill won't be able to hit a targed 5 Meters away from them.Even if they hit they won't do any noticable damage unless you use pistols or shotguns up close.

												I bought this as a risk on Amazon for £4 having never played a game like it before... little did i know that two weeks later i would find myself still completely immersed in the game play. The story lacks a little umph!, but the physics of the game are well designed and the real-time plan and go system is a beautiful asset, and apart from XCOM, i have found no similar games to JA:BiA.The game is well worth buying but not at the price on steam, Buy from amazon for about £2.90 and it will be one of the best buys you will make if you enjoy tactical shooters with a strategic edge and nac for micro management.Pro's - After re-balancing MOD (but not needed for enjoyable play) -- Excellent and unique interface for plan and go!.- Graphics are more than satisfying for its year.- Lots of Content and great micromanagement.- Challenging with multiple ways to achieve victory.- Openly modded with text config files.Cons' -- Story lacks any real drive for the final goal.- Before the updates, movement and objects for mercenaries had some flaws.- Bigger cities require beefy processor to handle all the moving objects i.e children and civilians.

												Jagged Alliance is great.Ever since the first Jagged Alliance, i've been hooked. Jagged Alliance 2 was even more brilliant. Party banter, crazy plots-if you wanted- , well balanced gameplay, good maps, sometimes utterly frustrating amounts of enemy presence.And then this came. Back in Action takes the JA2 soul and puts it into a new body. It's not as good as the original, but it comes SO close that I could do nothing else than recommend this game to everyone. You will not be sorry. Pick your team well, or pick it poorly and let it play out. Use planning, the landscape and careful tactics to your advantage as you tackle the vast army under Deidranna's command. Take her down, and save the country of Arulco.Do it now!Did you buy it yet?Good. If not, well, do it anyway!!! "

Late game becomes a slugfest due to this, instead of the more realistic assault scenarios of the early game.Enemies don't drop enough itemsNot enough rooftop access in the game, I guess it was too OP and they couldn't figure out a better way to nerf it besides not allowing you to get on roof tops "

												This game is still my go-to when I feel like some stress-free tactical badguy popping, but it's not without its issues.I've tried picking up JA2, but it feels far too clunky for 2016. The remake, by comparison, is streamlined almost to the point of oversimplicity. JA:BIA combines the slightly crap humour and storytelling of a game from the late 90s (most of the voice acting is recycled from JA2) with the visuals and minimalist UX of a 2014 iphone game.The mid-to-late game is almost unplayable without a rebalancing patch. I wrote my own, but I believe there are some downloadable from the interwebs. The maps are large and varied, but mostly unused. The AI - both enemy and merc - is almost nonexistant. Planning and executing a successful building assault or map clearance is still satisfying though, and while the game feels full of missed opportunities and never really lives up to its promise, it still has a certain charm. If you like plan-and-go-tactics and JA:BIA is on sale, then buy it, mod it, and enjoy it for what it is. If nothing in the premise speaks to you, or you're not willing to do the work to make it shine, then avoid.			"

												Jagged Alliance:  Back in Action is an exercise in compromises between improving an already good strategy game and keeping it true to the original. On one hand, the graphics are definitely better and the 3d aspect adds a lot to the overall look and feel of the game. On the other hand, the real-time battle system can be a real turnoff to purists looking for a straight upgrade to the original series.Other than the graphical and audio updates, most of the game is the same. You still have to save Arulco from the evil Deidranna and must do so by recruiting mercenaries, liberating towns, and stocking up on the latest military hardware. Combat tends to be a bit more frantic this time around, since it’s no longer turn-based, and you will have to find whatever method gets you the most success with the least number of loaded saves. On my playthrough I found that having a trio of snipers and three assault-style mercs set up in a layered line formation in guard mode (auto-attack) tended to work really well and I could just un-pause the game while they murdered everything with very few interruptions needed (your experience may vary). The game is unfortunately, not without its issues, hence the mixed rating on steam store. Determining line-of-sight is an absolute chore and the graphical interface does very little to help you determine the topology of the map you’re fighting on. This can lead to your characters being more exposed than you think they are and/or not able to fire on an enemy. This is aggravated a bit by the fact that your player must have a high perception score in order to automatically fire on far away targets in guard mode. While this isn’t a problem at the beginning of combat, when you suddenly have more enemies coming into the battle and have to start micro-managing forces it can become a bit of a pain.JA:BIA is another one of those games that makes you wish that Steam allowed for neutral ratings. I managed an entire playthrough and even enjoyed figuring out how to clear some of the maps, but I still wouldn’t rate this as a particularly “great” game, just an “okay” one that’s good for one playthrough and really moreso for people who aren’t religious Jagged Alliance fans (who would probably hate this game to death.)

Nah don't think so but you can bet your bottom dollar that the guy you have shot with your last round  and are looting NEVER has the same calibre ammo as your wepon takes.But anyway the music is good, battle sounds ok but firearms sound a bit too alike,voice acting is ok as well.It's cheap as chips at the moment so it  is great value for very little coin-give it a try...

												Deep, fun and engrossing strategy game. Back in Action is a great business and military sim.This is my first JA game. I have not played JA2 before BiA, however I did try playing JA2 that I brought for $10 at my local gameshop, but its low-res 2D graphics, complicated interface and lack of a tutorial made JA2 unplayable for me, so I went back into JA: BiA as this remake is a much better version of the inferior JA2.The Plan & Go system is great and works well, it speeds up the battles and allows you to command your Mercs to launch attacks and ambushes simultaneously. All future Jagged Alliance games should re-use the Plan & Go system.8/10			"

												As an avid fan of Jagged Alliance 2, I thought BiA could be what Wildfire miserably failed to be: the extension to the JA series that it has long-since needed and deserved. However... I was utterly disappointed. This ""game"" (if one can refer to it as that, since the word ""game"" implies fun and enjoyment, and you won't find any of that here!) performed poorly in every single aspect, be it gameplay, audio, visuals, or the TERRIBLE rehash of the original game's epic, almost titanic story. The complete lack of an option to create and customise your own merc is a VERY harsh blow to this title's already frail foundation, but the coup de grace is undoubtedly the horribly poor butchering of the pre-existing characters in the game. Not only have their voices (which were top-notch stuff in the original) been changed, but their personalities, skill-sets, and hell, even their appearances as well! Simply put, this ""game"" is best left to rot in the feces-strewn pile of horrible remakes throughout the history of games. A MUCH better choice would be to just buy the GOG.com version of the original (Jagged Alliance 2) instead, which - ironically - costs only one third of this atrociously poorly ""made"" (or shall I say... REMADE!) title. 0/10			"

												This game suffers from the same problem that all real-time tactical squad combat games suffer from: and that is poor AI.  There is only one tactic that you need to win ever battle in this game - simply lay prone behind a corner with a couple guys, fire a round to get the AI to investigate and just farm kills.   This is the same flaw with X-COM Apocalypse, it's the same problem with the entire UFO series, and it persists in Jagged Alliance BiA.If you want the REAL Jagged Alliance experience, do yourself a favor and go grab a copy of the originals.   They might be old games, but they're still some of the best.			"

												Pretty good.  It is hard and forces you to make tactical decisions and comprimises that matter.  The ai isn't terrible either.  I really wish that they went for a turn based combat system more akin to the original Jagged Alliance and Xcom.  However, the real time with frequent pauses to set up your team works after a bit of a learning curve.  Fun tactical combat experience with sufficient depth, detail, and difficulty to keep you interested.  Recommended for tactical combat fans.			"

												Not nearly as good as Jagged Alliance 2. Far from it, yet, it is enjoyable nonetheless. Until someone makes a true sequel, this game is well worth it.The graphics are good, except the mercenary pictures. they are ""3D"" and really ugly. Although you can spot some likenesses of the original mercs, these are really annoying to look at. They do change when equipping headgear though, so you can hide the face rather well with masks and helmets.Now the biggest disappointment for hardcore JA2 fans; The plan-and-go gameplay, which tries to merge RTS with Turn-based combat. As someone else said; prepare to do some micro-management. But I found the system to actually work surprisingly well. Ofcourse I prefer the true-turn-based combat of the original, yet this new hybrid thing isn't as bad as many would say. You can still plan ahead, set waypoints and execute excellent ambushes. The system is much deeper than you'd think. Just try it and you won't be disappointed.The story is the same as in the original, as well as most of the quests. I netted 176 hours into this one and is well worth the money imho. The only major gripe is, for me, not being able to create your own merc. A huge oversight. But other than a few things getting used to, it really is an under-rated game. For someone like me who absolutely hates RTS games, I thoroughly enjoyed it and even started a new campaign after a year.In short: I got my money's worth and recommend this game for anyone who likes to take combat at his/hers own pace.

												I want to like this game. I really want to. It is a shame that after Jagged Alliance 2 this franchise has been savaged at a pretty good clip.A continuation of the Jagged Alliance series that doesn't quite fit the bill. At times this game can be HIGHLY and EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING, as the bullet physics simply do not MAKE SENSE. I have had to replay scenario after scenario simply because my sniper who is equipped with a .50 cal barrett and a sniper scope is somehow unable to make a shot within 5 seconds that somehow bounces off an incoming enemy who is running towards my prone merc anticipating a shot. Jagged Alliance 2 was an amazing game. The characters each had their personalities and idiosyncrasies. This game comes across as feeling flat as there is zero dialogue between mercs.This game could have been so much more yet the devs failed on a variety of key points.1.) In this new series, your merc is UNABLE to repair armour. What does this mean? It means that you have to essentially shlep a merc back and forth, running orders for new armour. This translates into a huge waste of time and a waste of money. The game is seriously derailed because after a while you lose your armour and every single enemy AI you encounter has brand new armour. Lame.2.) The game is highly unbalanced and the devs are incompetent about this. It requires Ivan 6 seconds using a Barrett .50 cal with a scope to take a shot and all of his attributes are 90+ across the board. Yet it takes an enemy AI 2 seconds standing up to squeeze round after round and Ivan is dead before he gets a shot off. Idiotic.3.) It took me a record FIVE SHOTS from a PSG-1 50 feet away to drop an enemy AI. Each shot the enemy just shook it off. One shot alone with a 7.62 round 50 feet away to your head and your head would magically disappear into a fine mist. And yet the dev at BitComposer overlook this glaring fact.4.) Waiting patiently works against you. By the time I was ready and good to attack major cities, the number of enemy AI had bloated to over 80 a city. It took me around 3 hours of repeated saving and trying before I was able to take over the Docks which had 40 dead enemies. Ridiculous.5.) Enemy AI shooting mechanics are UNREALISTIC. I have had a merc prone some 50 feet away on an incline, which means he is facing the slope before having reached it. The other side the enemy AI has somehow managed to SHOOT ME THROUGH THE ♥♥♥♥ING HILL. Seriously...6.) Enemy AI will spot you miles down the road. Camouflage does not work. I have had snipers prone among trees and grass blended right in and the AI has been able to see me and also SHOOT ME THROUGH TREES AND ROCKS.7.) Camouflage counts for nothing.8.) The game forces you to heavily rely on micromanagement of cities with its system of hiring miltia. In Jagged Alliance 2 you could simply equip militia and watch a quick run through as they fount incoming troops. Whatever leftover troops were automatically leveled up. After a while, you could have a full compliment of militia and ANY town would be safe. In Back in Action, the computer will forever send 10 man teams to Cambria. Seeing that Cambria is an important city with its arms dealer, you are forced to park mercs to defend it. 9.) Regular militia are essentially useless. There are no defensive capabilities with militia. You can equip them with the latest weapons and armour and they will simply walk out in the open and get mowed down. It will cost you 10s of thousands to continue equipping them with weapons. 10.) There are no interrupts in this game like there were in Jagged Alliance 2 which is a shame, since you were rewarded for carefully planning your moves. 11.) Even with the balancing mod, your mercs take far too long to shoot. While it makes sense to take longer to peer down a scope and shoot, trained mercs in real-life who use red-dot sites or holographic sights can shoot in under 2 seconds at a target. In this game you can be lying prone on the ground with a machine gun and it will take your merc 2-3 seconds to ready himself to shoot while the AI will mow you down. Unless you are willing to play a game that involves loading save after save hours on end, don't bother getting this. If you do get this, get the Realism Balanced mod which not only addresses the glaring gun flaws but adds new weapons. It makes the game playable.All I want to ask the devs is, WTF kind of QA do you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ do at BitComposer?Take a look at the screenshot below.  Wolf is UNDER WATER hidden behind trees with roots blocking the view. And yet he is still spotted. W T F IS THIS B U L L S H I Thttp://i.imgur.com/WrxqmVn.jpgDo not buy this game unless you want to spend 90% of your time reloading save after save.What's german for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs who make broken games?

												The gaming process is great, but the implementation (at least, on OS X) is incredibly buggy.For example, the very first weapon merchant seemingly got his guns duplicated every time I visited him, making the game slower and slower, so at some point I just became unable to speak with him, waiting for 10 minutes after ""mouth"" click and getting no shop pop-up;also, each merchant has the most stupid bug, letting me to drop any ""cheap"" my weapon or item on any ""expensive"" item of the merchant, and get that expensive item for free!The last but not the least was that when I've got another merc in the team, it arrived at the airport, and I've moved him and joined to the other two mercs — during the next battle the savegame became corrupted, removing all the remaining enemies from the map, making unable to move to the world map, and, most funnily, getting all the mercs on the map duplicated!Since that save contained the result of			"

They were great experiances. This is a great ♥♥♥♥ing experiance as well just give it a damn try. Look past the fact its called jagged alliance look past the same kinda of aesthetics (being the laptop layout and island setting) . This is an entirely different style of squad tactics and its done very well.  Think of dragon age origins with guns and you will have a pretty good idea of what the game play feels like. AI isnt the best but it does a pretty good jib of providing a challenge. There are a few things you do need to keep an eye on. Your mercs tend to not defend themselves very well when they are rushed by a melee enemy. You cant fire a gun in melee for what ever reason but you can use your firearm as a blunt instrument however you will need to click the attack button in order for your merc to lay the smack down. So mircomanagement is a thing, but in a dragon age origin style pause and play game why wouldnt there be a major focus on micro mangaement . Ive put in a few hours and im loving every second of it. I cant wait to see more. If you like pause and play combat andhave a hard on for squad tactics with guns and frag granades galore give this title a shot			"

												Back In Action is one of those titles were the Metascore actually says it all. 62 % average is actually rather generous. Jagged Alliance 2 still remains my favorite game of all times and is right up there with X-COM as prime examples of TBS gaming at it's best. Back in Action is the tragic reality of what happens when classic IP's go up for sale in a gaming industry were Call of Duty and Halo are the kind of titles that investors would rather commit to. Back in Action does not deserve to carry the name. And BitComposer has done the franchise a great injustice by allowing such a game to be made, and not to mention alienating the old fans by asking us for our input (via their forum in the infancy of the games development) and then doing the exact opposite of what the majority asked for.   And when sales and reviews were terrible... they still insisted that Turn Based Games are dead... And then XCOM Enemy Unknown was released...If you never played JA or you aren't to concerned with deep strategic gameplay mixed with a serious learning curb, then you might enjoy this. If you like a good TBS title, XCOM Enemy Unknown isn't without its faults, but is leagues above this poorly designed attempt at cashing in on a cult classic. Especially with the DLC's included (like Enemy Within).        "

												This game is sloppy and complicated. I am actually surprised it was released recently. I really wanted to like Jagged Alliance. I'm a huge fan of Fallout Brotherhood, and I just got off a XCom : Enemy Unknown kick. Jagged Alliance falls flat in it's ability to explain how to play. There's a tutorial, but it pushes into the world and makes you sink or swim. Even something as simple as shooting at a target is complicated. Why is defending a perimeter is hard? There are tactics-style games from 5 years ago that do it better than Jagged Alliance. I could not figure out how to play, and after a hour or two, I gave up. XCOM must have spoiled me. Jagged Alliance makes moving and shooting so frustrating that is ruined any chance for me picking it back up.			"

												I have all the JA games ever made and this one is just lacking something. I can live with real-time-combat system but when there isn't that custom merc creation this just isn't my game. Creating the Alter-Ego was the heartand soul of the JA2 and it makes the JA2 much better than JA-BiA. This feels like ruined game whick had much potential though. I think the developers just went too lazy and didn't finish the final product. The game basically works but it isn't polished enough and when the main stroy is borrowed from the JA2 the gameplay feels more or less boring. I waited something new and special and this just turned me off. Oh one more thing. The AI is just horrible. There are only few people I know who still can make good AI - coding and it's shame this project didn't include any of them. The ""consolidation"" today has sweeped out good programmers and sadly this game suffers from same phenomenon too.			"

												Do not buy this game. Do not play this game. Do not listen to anyone who says this game is anything other than a waste of cash. Obligatory comment re: having played all the JA series, XCOM, Shadowrun Returns, Antisquad, et cetera. The JA reboot's problem is that after six hours' play, you can see the exact moment that the developers shrugged, said ""meh, it's good enough"" (or ran out of budget) and handed it over to the modding community to fix its many glaring problems.It looks nice, but lacks the soul of the original. You'll find your local militia getting overwhelmed regardless of equipment. Many maps are simply too large for a small squad to beat, and the enemy forces are both vicious and highly mobile. There are any number of glaring line of sight and cover issues, and equipment degrades so fast you'd think you were swimming through acid. Overwatch fire is ineffective. The metagame of protecting your territory and hiring more teams or getting new equipment is just tacked-on rather than integrated into the overall experience.All in all, and being a huge fan of small-unit tactics games, I'd say give this one a miss. If you never played JA2 you'll find this game frustrating because it's bad. If you did play JA2, you'll find yourself uninstalling this and going back to it because this is just so unfulfilling.			"

												This actually is a very good game, There are very few Turn Based Stratergys these days that add the character bulding elements quite so well.  Its a very challenging game that can lead to frustration, sometimes losing hours of saves because one of the guys you spent hours on died!  Most of the time you can get them up with a medic but you can quickly take on catastrophic casualties.The side missions can be difficult and not very well explained, there are a fair few good guides for the faint of heart and if your one of these hardcore types I am pretty sure they can keep you going for a good while. Supplys can be hard to work out, and the flow of time is very odd at times :D  The story really is neither here nore there. If you looking for Depth and story telling this is not the game for you. If you want to spend hours and hours planning your perfect kills then this is the game for you. Stealth is very hard to master on this game, You always feel like your guys could not hit a cows♥♥♥♥♥♥with a bango.  You learn to never expect your guys to take out a key target with one shot.. I find lining up a fire death squad works great but then you quickly find you have a ton of guys charging in at you.The AI, is really nothing to write home about, They respond when they hear or see things, this can be quite a long distance too... But if you silently slaughter someone, and run away, they will quite happily step over their dead body.. Just assume they hated them so much they care little they died horrifically. Overall, the game hits the spot when it comes to upgrading a team, and shooting things turn based style. Lots of options of weapons, Lots of options of entry into buildings, Lots of configurations in building your team.What is really missing from this game, is your own customed avatar of death. Its by far the one thing i hate, you cant create your very own guy with your own specific set of skills to start you off and that my friends is a damn shame.OVERALL RATING 80%Its a good game that has kept me playing about 150 hours, but I have still not completed it! True i keep restarting but who doesnt :D			"

You could complete the revolution of a real banana republic in less time. Let me put it this way: Kurt Cobain spent 20% as much time suffering from migraines (""Not Recommended"") and he killed himself.

												The game is unfinished! It lags no matter what settings you have, it has the same amount of framerate issues at highest as the lowest settings, no difference. I cant finish the game because in a certain point of the game it crashes and you cant even continue because it keeps crashing. The game without mods is almost unplayable! The difficulty is BRUTAL! There is no money to earn so you cant buy anything. Armor breaks too easily and costs WAY too much. Mercenaries costs more than you earn in a whole week and the enemies later on are basically bullet sponges. The pathfinding is abysmal, the enemy AI is worthless and your teammates wont even shoot back when getting attacked. If you want your squad to go anywhere but straight forward you will have problems because they will get stuck, run into mines or just do stupid crap so you have to pinpoint every teammembers movement by yourself to save you the trouble. And that goes with everything you do! The combat without micromanagement is game over! There is fun to be had because it has great potential. But its too broken to even bother!			"

												Gameplay is mess, just when you think you are having fun some game-breaking issue comes along. The inventory system is a mess, want to repair the guns all these gun you looted? You have to equip each gun and swap them out every time. Supply system is a tedious and invovles running naked people to and from the airport, looking for vendors to buy and sell your loot while waiting for the sipment of supplies. A lot of your game time is wasted just doing that. AI is downright stupid. they run right at you and are highly accurate no matter how much of an disadvantage they are in. The planning system rarely goes as planned thanks to the dumb AI and blocking/pathfinding issues, be prepared to bump into stuff, spin in circles, crouch or prone for no reason, walk instead of run, turn an easy throw of a grenade that lands at your feet. Line of sight is awful, somehow enemies are able to see me through walls or windows even though I'm crouched or prone. Enemy patrols take over zones you had liberated without much effort even when the miltia is upgraded. You will feel like this is the special forces unit of The Three Stooges.			"

												This game is disappointing, because it could have been so much better.The biggest gripe i have with it, is that you can´t create your own solider like in former games, but there are many more flaws on the gameplay level. No Fog of War, No general Inventory, No training for soliders or militia, an easily exploitable enemy AI, and a few minor things. Overall it feels like a dumbed down and way easier version of JA2.On the technical side its not flawless either. The UI is cumbersome to use, the Map is hard to navigate. And my favourite pet peeve: The keys are not customizable. Overall its a step backwards compared to JA2.But with all those flaws, i still will play it, because there isnt alot else in this genre at the moment. It is still entertaining overall and i want to explore the map and play through the story.Give it a try if you really liked the former Jagged Alliance games, but dont set your hopes too high, this is not a new masterpiece, its a medicore game.

												Definitely a deviation from the JA series but is an ok game in its own right. By far, my biggest complaints are with the AI.Your soldiers are absolute morons and can't do anything without being micromanaged. Even when set to guard your Mercs often won't shoot at enemies within range and sight zone, you have to manually tell them ""Hey kill that guys who's shooting your face."" They see a mine? Better halt em or they'll run over it. This is super annoying when splitting a squad into smaller teams for flanking. Want them to go talk to someone? Better hope there's no closed doors in the way. They are incapable of opening them to get to somewhere on their own. Also ran into several issues with game freezes & crashes.For a real time squad based game, which I tend to hate in comparison to turn based, it isn't too bad thanks to the ability to pause and issue commands. Though sadly, even that system has its flaws. Once your guys run out of shoot commands, they'll stop shooting. I often found myself just staying in real time or loading up with dozens of shoot commands to cut down on the micromanaging.			"

												The biggest mistake Back in Action did was to put Jagged Alliance in front of it.Like the latest Star Trek movie Back in Action (BiA) use the same names and places but has nothing in common what we once associated with Jagged Alliance.However this doesn't necessarily mean it's bad, but wrong expectations will lead to disappointment.If you're planing to buy BiA  in expectation to relive a previous decade old Jagged Alliance experiences you will be disappointment.If you plan to play BiA because you are looking for a good squad based tacticsgame you will find a decent one.I'm especially fond of the Plan&Go system.Plan&Go gives you the same depth like round based. Actually it's even deeper than round based because you can synchronize actions and have you mercenaries act simultaneously instead consecutively.Downs are the very bad inventory system and not rebindable controls.Back in Action is a good strategy game and I will finish it a second time with an all female amazon squad.

												A fun game with potential for greatness with some polish and/or mods - this title has me hooked on the series again. I welcome the improvement in the game like the 'Plan & Go' system which many die-hard fans were suspicious of - it really helps make the game more enjoyable to play with its fast-paced action. It cuts back on a lot of tedium of the conventional turn based orders but the system still offers you great amount of flexibility to pause and issue very carefully thought out orders to your squad with actions which could be synchronized so it gets the best part of turn based gameplay. There are several features which may disappoint such as the lack of fog of war, the way you can't always loot what enemies carry, some unrealistic stats for some weapons and an interface which can be more streamlined especially with managing, selling, transferring inventory on your mercs. But thankfully a lot of these issues are already addressed by mods you can install.  "

												Back in action is a little backwards. The tactics are questionable, opportunities for stealth limited, thiers often to many enemy to make a show of it as being rushed buy them is the game, harder the maps more the ememy, less opportunity for stealth. Thiers more or less one tactic which is all you need to easilly complete this game. The enemy are nerfed to the point of an enemy with a assault riffle will hit you with automatic fire where your own soldiers with sniper rifles can barely make a hit. You often need to manually aim for your soldiers so they shoot out further to take out enemies shooting at you. Your soldiers competancy is in question too even with max skill, or maybe its the nerfing of the enemy? which is what really spoils this game. You die many times which will teach to play better but will also frustrate you. A simple obstacle can not be overcome, you cant go through a window, over a gaurd rail, climb onto a roof without a ladder which are very rare, this really restricts the variety of tactics. You want to play the game because of its potential which for this genere games like this are rare. I recommend Jagged Alliance Crossfire, because your soldiers can breach windows, climb roofs and jump down from things. Pitty but RPG games of old are often better than thier remakes!			"

												It's not an 1 to 1 remastered JA 2 with better graphics, but I like it.When you encounter enemies it's a only kind of turn based, you can stop the game any time and give your orders to the mercs. The map design is good and I love the individual mercs. Bad things I have to admit.1. It's boring and time consuming to repair all weapons after a battle (the orginal JA2 did it better).2. In the hand of the enemy the weapons behave different (enemies hit you with a burst of a submachine from the hip over long range).3. Less story: Some parts from the original like Deidranna shoutinging at Elliot, Mike and helicopter flights are missing.The developers stopped their support and there are still some flaws in the game. In the forum you find mods from fans which improve the game.There is a demo which you should try first.It's not so outstanding like its predecessors (Jagged Alliance 1 or 2) at their time and I recommend buying the complete package with all DLCs on a sales action.My guide:

												So its similiar to Jagged Alliance 2 in theme and setting - you are hired by the deposed Enrico Chivasomethingorotherforeign(His real last name is cooler) to go kill some queen because shes oppressing some country. You hire mercenaries and go in and shoot everything that moves and/or looks at you funny and try to liberate the country.So the similiarities tend to end there, they are games of a different albeit similiar genre. I think the real time RTS is more fluid and certainly looks a lot more cinematic when you're in a dramatic realtime battle, but in its current format its fun, but i think the (sometimes tedious) Jagged Alliance 2 1.13 combat is far superior. Of course while this combat never gets tedious because its a lot faster and more fluid than the turn based system, i tend to find that this combat can be more frustrating. i tend to know why something happened in JA2, i ran out of bullets and was reloaded and he put a shotgun shell through my gut, well okay fair enough. But in Back in Action i've done things such as kicked open a door, ambushing a machine gun wielding bad guy from behind, with three soldiers with SMGs and shotguns at close range, in the hip fire stance, he turned around from his crouch and gunned them all down in a matter of moments before they could even fire. However its still fun, its still worth playing especially if you get it on sale, the original price might be a bit steep. 8/10 - rated slightly higher than i would have just because its such a good setting and genre and they dont make enough of these in modern gaming			"

												Fired this game up after a pause(~6month) and LOL-d hard at the very beginning, on the first hire: ""Fidel is not himself lately. And it´s not a bad thing"". Haven´t finished the prequels- tried them as a kid a bit- and maybe this game isn´t like the prequels, but it doesn´t mean it´s bad to the bones. The characters are funny and the whole game has the ""parody thing"" going on. The best thing about JABIA is the camera handling imo. With ALT key it´s possible to peak behind every corner and with aided aiming lines it´s possible to precisely plan my actions. And for the good camera work I´ve ditched ""other"" turn based games to come enjoy this one. In general if you know the rules the game sets for you, then it´s more certain in outcome than other tactical turn based games. And that´s what I like about this game; if I choose the right team with right equipment for the job then the outcome is mine to decide. Main factors to take into account are equipment+skills which decide my mercs aiming time and enemies are wallhacking aimbots.But both sides hit if the teamwork is planned correctly. If the rules are accepted from the very beginning then the game can be entertaining- can´t be anything better than setting team to nade the room and then rush in to clean the room with pump action shotguns and all that executing out in a few secs.Now to the AI part. Yep the AI and game mechanics is unfinished. It´s actually possible to go on stealth kills against lvl 1(maybe 2 also) enemies but but later in game against higher level AI the only way is rambo style. (DLC Point Blank was fun bc I could go with 45 cal silenced pistol and take out the whole garrison alone). In the early stage it´s important to choose correct merc for certain tasks, if it says expert in stealth, then stealth approach is doable etc...The most fun part is the start of the game, where I can play out different approaches till it goes rambo style with 2 squads of rambos.And for as old a game as this, it still looks good though unoptimised.Later in game there is indeed lot´s of micromanagement- all actions must be double checked on mercs, mules have to carry equipment over the map etc. But grinding money for equipment can be fun too.One good side of the game is that when I return to my favourite multiplayer FPS I always think more tactically and am doing much better. Haven´t experienced this with any other tactical turn based games, so it must do something right in the end...			"

												Buggy piece of crap.  I got used to the display freezing on me every once in a while when rotating the screen.  I got used to the awkward controls like using the mouse with ALT to rotate the screen, not being able to hot-key merc selection while in the inventory screen.  Even figured out the oddities that don't seem to be explained in the game like where you pick up the stuff you order from the online merchant, how you synchronize actions in command mode (which was incorrectly explained in the tutorial), and how you go from the world map back to the tactical map.But this this bug I found was the last straw.  After purchasing items from the online merchant and picking up from the crate at the airport, apparently the items reappear in the crate if you go to the world map and back to the tactical view.  This is a bug that you would think would work to your advantage and I wouldn't be so upset about right?  Well sometimes the delivery crate also contains spiders (I'm assuming this is not a bug).  They don't hurt you and are merely an annoyance (or some kind of dry joke).  However, apparently the ""items reappearing"" bug must cause the spiders to multiply in the crate everytime you go to the world screen and back to the tactical screen.  This in itself wouldn't be such a big deal except that the spiders multiply it means that there are more items for the game to load when to go into the tactical view.  Eventually, there were so many spiders in the crate, I couldn't even retrieve the items I purchased because I had to scroll past all the spiders that had built up.  Even further, at some point, I stopped being able to speak to the merchant in the area as I believe he suffered from a similar bug which caused the number of items he was selling to build up.Finally, this last time I went into the tactical view of the area, it simply wouldn't load and the game froze up.  I'm guessing the number of items it had to load was too great and my system simply didn't have the resources.I loved the previous Jagged Alliance incarnations and this one was initially looking pretty good despite its many quirks.  But Kalypso crossed the line when they basically made my saved game, that I spent hours on, unplayable.  Even if there is a fix put out for this bug, I'm not sure how it would fix my saved game as I'm sure the item list for each sector is saved in the file.If you got this far through my rant, I reward you with this recommendataion.  No matter how extreme the discount is on this game, don't buy it until the publisher unscrews themselves and fixes the bugs.  Save yourself the money and the heartache.			"

												A fun game with potential for greatness with some polish and/or mods - this title has me hooked on the series again. I welcome the improvement in the game like the 'Plan & Go' system which many die-hard fans were suspicious of - it really helps make the game more enjoyable to play with its fast-paced action. It cuts back on a lot of tedium of the conventional turn based orders but the system still offers you great amount of flexibility to pause and issue very carefully thought out orders to your squad with actions which could be synchronized so it gets the best part of turn based gameplay. There are several features which may disappoint such as the lack of fog of war, the way you can't always loot what enemies carry, some unrealistic stats for some weapons and an interface which can be more streamlined especially with managing, selling, transferring inventory on your mercs. But thankfully a lot of these issues are already addressed by mods you can install.  "

												The biggest mistake Back in Action did was to put Jagged Alliance in front of it.Like the latest Star Trek movie Back in Action (BiA) use the same names and places but has nothing in common what we once associated with Jagged Alliance.However this doesn't necessarily mean it's bad, but wrong expectations will lead to disappointment.If you're planing to buy BiA  in expectation to relive a previous decade old Jagged Alliance experiences you will be disappointment.If you plan to play BiA because you are looking for a good squad based tacticsgame you will find a decent one.I'm especially fond of the Plan&Go system.Plan&Go gives you the same depth like round based. Actually it's even deeper than round based because you can synchronize actions and have you mercenaries act simultaneously instead consecutively.Downs are the very bad inventory system and not rebindable controls.Back in Action is a good strategy game and I will finish it a second time with an all female amazon squad.

Bugs prevent me from finishing the tutorial, and from playing at all (another bug messing with screen size detection draws half of the interface off-screen). So I couldn't even make an hour gameplay. The linux forum of the game seems discontinued for months.I'll try the windows version, because I really want to love this game. If I get more than 10 hours of gameplay, probably it is good enough for a bundle game. But for what I've seen in this short time, the game feels so unpolished and love-lacking...  "

												In my mind, there are Four aspects that make up a game. There's the Story (within that, the character development), The Gameplay (within that, the difficulty), The Graphics (within this, the audio as well as the visual.) and the game's ability to be enjoyed (and replayability, of course.). Naturally, there's also bugs as an issue but, that's something that works out over time.JA:BIA is a Mediocre game. It has passable graphics and audio (for a relatively minor B grade game), next to no story (they didn't need to develop the story - the story existed from the origins of this game) and acceptable gameplay. The Gameplay is RTwP (real time with pause) which is a fantastic genre that people don't see enough of, or appreciate at all. While it's not the TBS of the original games, this particular form of gameplay is very entertaining, bringing one to the last note on this list, the game's ability to be enjoyed.If you have played the original JA games, you probably won't like this as a JA game. IF you pretend it's not a JA game, it's pretty fun. So, my word to you is to play it as if it were not a JA game, but simply a game to stand on its own two feet. It deserves some attention for its gameplay delivery. I'd give it a solid 6/10. It's not fantastic, but you'll definitely get your money's worth.			"

												Do you like Xcom: Enemy Unknown? If so you'll probably like this too. Like Xcom this is based on an old turn based series, unlike Xcom this game has gone the pausable realtime route (you're able to pause the game any time and issue orders). Very satifying strategy game with some great RPG elements not to mention the huge variety of guns and other equipment in the game. "

												First off, I have only played Jagged Alliance 2, but if you have played any previous installments of Jagged Alliance at all, you might be disappointed with this game.  The combat is one up on the old turn based that the old games had, but the fact that your militia are so underpowered and undergeared, I found that it makes it very difficult to get into the game very far.

												Good old Jagged Alliance. At first it feels just like you remember it, but after a few hours you realize that it is just a pretty husk of the game you once loved. It lacks the crafting system from the old game, meaning, no weapon modifications built from iron pipes and glue, springs and rods etc.The combat can be done in real time, which makes the action part a lot more intensive, but with the enemy AI being next to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and the enemies numbers near infinate, it falls flat. The only problem in the game is ammo management, which is a logistical problem.TLDR; This is a logistics management game, not the fun adventure/action game you used to play.			"

												Im not sure if this game is this friggan bad or if I am just playing it wrong.Lets talk about the very base of the game first. The combat system is real time but it has all the quirks of a TBS game. It sucks. Its just freaking aweful. Either go real time like Men of War or turn based like the older games to what I know or any good turn based game. Instead what we have here is a game with a system that plain dousn't work. Its a bad combination of elements from either. Basically what happens is you try to plan something out than something goes wrong and it all falls apart faster than you can do anything about it partially because of the clunkiness of the game as a whole but also because it just dousn't work. I had to save and load and repeat just to beat the first mission. It took over an hour. Planning or not, dousn't matter. Silencers don't do much since the enemy AI is already brain dead and pretty much just runs straight at you occasionally doing some interesting flanking stuff but Im not sure thats even on purpose. I say Im not sure because this game sucks so bad I can't get very far in it. I havn't played the originals but they cannot be this bad.There are just alot of things that are off about this game. They should have stayed TBS as it would solve alot of them. Its just flawed in its core elements. Nothing more worth saying really.			"

												To remake a game and remove many of the features of the original is utterly stupid and lazy, as if the programmers and game designers were abject failures at their craft.  There is no character creation, the humorous cutscenes were removed, no mines, and the game feels nothing like Jagged Alliance 2 at all.The publisher claimed that the remake was being made to address ""the weaknesses of the original.""  What weakness, praytell?  Idiots.  The orignal game was perfect, and this a failed attempt to bring the game into the modern era.  Why is it that we cannot get a faithful remake of our favorite classic games?  Thankfully, there is a market for the original classics and we can continue to play them well into the future.			"

												I had more hopes for a rework of the series, well I'm slightly dissapointed.Better graphics and nice 3D effects. Gameplay is a bit better than earlier and I really like the active pause and action planning with possibility to time actions of your merc's.The change from actions based on turn/point into times needed in active mode.Less weapons to choose from, less accesories and no more DIY accesories. Health regained instantly after applying meds (no need to w8 for them to heal) - exception when your merc was revived. Merc's are employed for the whole game (at least it seems so) - it was bit of a pain to remember to renew your contract but it was more realistic + earlier you could hire more expensive merc's for a shorter time. You can only hire military by giving them a weapon personally (the pain ...) , I preffered older militia training rather than this ""new"" way.			"

												Enjoyable, though I'd liken it more to an RPG than a TBS for sure. I've never played the old ones but I really do like the concept and general gameplay. It's also nice to play a challenging RPG for once though the difficulty curve is really uneven.That said, this is a title published by a B-producer and it REALLY shows. There are massive amounts of glitches, quirks, dumb things, and the UI really needs a good streamlining/overhaul in general. The first thing that happened to one of my mecs was climbing a ladder with no way to stop them. And even after I'd learned everthing regarding combat, I still make lots of mistakes regarding stances, guard mode etc. Fortunately the game has an autosave feature every combat, but having to use it to fix a mistake feels really cheesy...I still like it a lot though, despite the flaws. This is my type of game, managing a mercenary company on a world map picking your targets and building a team as versatile or specialized as you want is fun.			"

												JA:BIA is a fun squad combat game, with some role play elements. Quests are usually ... find item A and run to B, but it's a nice touch that keeps you busy. The combat is addicting and fun. The good mix of mercs, merc personalities to get a good morale, items and approaches to areas give you tons of options to play. After the recent patch a lot of problems got fixed and the game plays smoother and the gameplay got deeper. The aim time on top of your merc, shooting through objects with the right caliber ammo, attachments working right, guns being in the right gun class, new ammo for the grenade launcher etc. JA:BIA got closer to JA2, but it still lacks some depth, inventory and militia handling is still uncomfortable, your own merc is missing as well .... Round based strategy purists will not like the real time approach, even with the pause and command options. It doesn't really matter though, cause the game is more then solid now. 7,5/10			"

												Rough around the edges but very addicitve. The game is focused around squad micromanagement and tactical combat with some minor macro options. You can pause/resume any time you see fit and different weapons/gadgets allow you to approach encounters in various ways. Squad relationship options are limited but have a significant stat impact (certain mercs love/hate each other, have preferences, etc). My main gripes with the game were that #1 stats override tactics in many occasions (you can spray a target in point blank with an MP5K and still miss) and #2 movement is a bit limited (no side-step option, no peak/lean from cover,etc). Overall, an enjoyable game that is easy to pick up and play, has a fair ammount of replayability but needed that xtra dev time/love to really shine.  "

The meat of the game however, planning your attack and executing, is brilliant. You have the freedom to hire a multitude of characters with different strengths and weaknesses, manage multiple squads, tons of different weapons and items. Each character levels up and has a unique personality (voice). This is about as close as you can get to running your own mercenary empire.			"

												For the most part feeling goes into 2 directions with this game, those that played the original game and hate this one because it’s not at JA game.   And new players who hate it because well…  it’s a hard game to like.   I fall into about the .01% who actually really liked the game a lot.   I enjoyed both the combat and the ability to mod the game.   I tinkered for hours and hours with the weapons and download great mods that introduced new gear.   I would love to tell you that if only players would do X they too could love the game but alas I can’t.  All the things that make 99% of all gamers hate the game are things I was able to overlook.  Let’s take the inventory management for example, before the last major patch from Bit-Composer managing your inventory was something written straight out of hell.  Of the 300 some hours I have playing I would guess that somewhere around 140 of them were not playing just managing the darn inventory.  Then you have the fans, I understand JA was a fun game but that was over a decade ago.  Folks just couldn’t separate the old game from this new version and accept it for what it was.   Folks took it as some personal slight that BitComposer was out to ruin the JA name.   From the horrible AI, to the poor game making skills for bitComposer JABIA was guaranteed to be hated.  Yet inside this hot mess of a game lies something that I personally find fun and enjoyable, and I just can’t explain why.    Perhaps for only me I would rate this game   88/100   for everyone else 65/100			"

												Good strategy game if you like real time pause mechanics.  I prefer this method to true turn based.  Lots of weapons and items to use and the mercenaries are able to grow in whatever directio you prefer to take them as they level up.  If you enjoy trying different strategies and ways of completing a task this could be a good game to spend loads of time on.			"

												This game requires an awkward review. Its a lousy Jagged Alliance game. But its a great game on its own right. The issue is that they changed the combat system and a lot of core mechanics that are at the heart of a Jagged Alliance game. Had they released this as a separate series and kept everything else the same - the game would have been received a lot better.			"

												Jagged Alliance Back in Action is a great Startegy, Shooter game.Once you get into this game you wil not regret it, JABIA is ENSLAVING once you start to play you can't get away!!However on the downside of things although JABIA is an awesome game they dont really explain how to use some of the really basic things in the Tutorial like how Militia works. KIMBOF1's Score = 4.5/5Yes the tutorial is not clear but once you learn everything JABIA can become a very good game.			"

												This game is a jumbled mess.It looks like the old school Jagged Alliance, but the controls and features are implemented so obtusely that an operation can be botched by one of your soldiers stupidly walking at a leisurely pace into a platoon of heavily armed enemies. I'll spare you the details, but it's a constant problem while playing.A very flawed tribute...			"

												While the game can be entertaining at times, there are major flaws with the design...- Mercenaries are traditionally retired Special Forces down to those with minimal Armed Forces training.. Regardless, anyone working in a team would know not to shoot their own team-mate; the biggest game-play flaw to-date is that your own men will shoot the other. I've tried in many different configurations from 2 to 3 men per team. When I try to have the front man crouch and the rear man stand ( as is one important form ) the rear-man ends up in front because of issues with pathing and the front man, now rear, shoots the rear man, now front... Same with 3 man team, I try to have 1 crouch and 2 stand ( so 2 standing fire on either side of the crouched shoulder ) but the issue still arises. No matter the positions whether all crouched, proned, standing or in various different settings ( so they can move together ) they end up shooting each other.- Pathing is terrible, team-mates get stuck in corners and run for ages before the system corrects the issue.- Tutorial is heavily scripted and if you complete an action prior to it asking ( such as repairing the weapon ) then the tutorial breaks and you can no longer continue.- Group pathing is also terrible, as mentioned in - number 1; the group does not move as one when you want it to if you want the game to be played as a RTS without setting up the space-bar system ( but players still don't move together even when you try ). Another issue is with rotation, ie you have finally got the crouched man in front and the standing man in rear, now when you want to move 90 to 180 degrees in another direction, it is reversed ( and lets hope the ai is in the correct position so your team-mates don't shoot each other ).- When you order an item from the ""online store"", there is no estimated time to arrival regardless of whether you select ""Standard shipping"" or ""Expedited shipping"".- Online Store Receipt doesn't list what you ordered.- Online Store E-Mail when your items arive doesn't state which order arrived with which items.- No common sense among mercenaries in this game. This game is more frustrating that enjoyable.- If you give a weapon to a recruit and leave to the world map while the recruit is pulling the weapon out ( read as: They received the weapon, the dialog closed, the animation is playing ) the money, the weapon and the recruit is lost. You have to find or buy a new weapon in order to recruit the person for a second time.- On level load, players randomly shoot their own team-player.- Kill cam resets YOUR camera settings ( and game-play continues without being able to stop it when active meaning it needs to be disabled in the gameplay options [ game-play is the right spot for it because it interferes with it ] )The game is riddled with bugs.

They just get stuck and keep on walking. No commands are possible anymore. Only reload helps, but still, not able to enter houses.If anyone knows hot to fix this, I would be very to be contacted!Thanks!			"

												Good job completely and utterly ruining an entire branch of a game that has been epic ever since it came out.I play strat games, rts tbh, etc, i loved the ♥♥♥♥ out of JA ever since i was a child, always looked forward to more, but this installment is so broken, the UI is janky at best, even with mods, you cant make your own merc like in the prior games (which in my opinon kind of ruins the whole aspect of the game itself) and the enemy AI is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid that no matter what mechanics you want to try and play, wether you want to be a ninja, assassin and try doing everything in stealth, or just go straight out balls to the wall fire fight, it always comes down to getting the enemies to swarm your position with you behind a wall and run into a death, because no matter what happens after that one shot the lot of them seem to instantly know where you are wether youre hiding or not and they all come running into the party.

												As a person who played all JA series, I feel that this is one of those games that can actually make you spend time to sit down, ponder of what actions to do and keep re-trying of the particular scenario that you are trying to achieve.Much as I would want everything to be perfect while in this game. The game makes you keep playing to a certain extend. Not physically stressed but mentally. Its tiresome. Yes. But it is fun due to never ending difficulty rush in the game and though majority of the AI are silly and quite easily baited.For those who are perfectionist and wants to have a knack at it.

												This is far from any Jagged Alliance original that was produced before this. It hasn't got the same charisma as the games before. Having taken away the 'create your merc' option was such a terrible idea and took away from the experience of a JA game.The enemy difficulty shoots up dramatically from revolver and machete users to SKS and AK users after taking one or two beginnning towns. My team of 3 who were beind trees and in prone position (AKM, SCAR & CAR-15), were taken out by 7 enemies standing in the open. I understand I was expecting casualties but I got taken out and all 7 enemies were still standing.I loaded up again and tried even better cover, I got taken out again with no casualities on the enemy side. This time my men wouldn't shoot because of ant hills even though the view showed an all green cone.I cannot recommend this game to any original fans even after trying for a few hours.			"

												to make it quick and simple: the worth of this game is not even 1$.If you are looking for a ""tactical game"", take XCOM Enemy Unknown. Heck, even Deux Ex Human Revolution have more tactical indepth then this ""jagged alliance"" installment. (and do not fool yourself, the highly recommended ""realistic mods"" do not make this game even a bit better.- mercs do not retain formation when moved as squad. a squad movement command will always default to the standard formation: 2 mercs in front line, 2 in the backline. when you now issue an attack command, the 2 mercs in the backline will kill the two in front of them. micromanaging all mercs is not always desirable.- abilities mean ""virtualy"" nothing. sure, 100strength = 100 hitpoints, 100agility = 100stamina and you need 10mechanical in order to use weapon oil, but besides that...  dexterity and marksmanship are required to calculate ""hit probability"", but there is no difference between 60dex 40marksman and 100 100. there is no difference between 50 and 100 perception. more strength does not make you inflict more melee damage. intelligence is also worthless. enemies spot you, no matter if you got the right camouflage, moving at night and your stealth is 100, even if you are not moving and hiding at 200m distance in a brush.- camouflage not working- stealth not working, you just need to be in the point of view of the enemy and he got you- line of sight is only true for you, not the ai (especialy funny, when you are up on a roof in prone stance and the emey a) spots you (lol) and shoots andhits you, while you can not shoot back.- every AI soldier is a master at arms, who have 100% hit chance at any range, from any position, no matter if the players mercs are hidden and behind some cover- tactics are not possiblea) only about 30% of the enemy forces are actualy patroling. everyone else is hunkered down in a perfect position, waiting for you to come, even if you let them wait 10 days.b) sneaking to an unuspecting guard and killing it, does not work, thanks to not working stealth and perception.c) there is no good positioning, or flanking. the enemy always hit you, regardless of cover and when you are engaged in combat, all your mercs positions are miracurously known by the enemies.every encounter in this game is a shootout between your mercs and the enemies, without cover, on plain field. whoever brings the best weapons, wins.any difficulty / challenge in this game comes from the extremely sloppy programming, frustration will be your constant companion during this game.the realistic rebalancing and combat evolved mods are making things a bit better, but just a bit.

												DO NOT BUY IT!!! I know it looks like a great game, and it supose to be if it wasen't from all the bugs that drive us crazy! Don't trust me? Try to look the reviews on the internet. Here are some exsamples of the bugs thats drive me crazy:- The sniper tells you that hit the target is impossible with the best rifle in the game, but the enemy is hiting you with a hand gun. From the distance, if is not a bug he has a super pocket sniper rifle that I don't know about it... Or my merc is blind and I don't know it.- The merc ignores your comand. Insted of stop runing and do what you want he will just keep runing and geting shoot at by the enemy. If you press HALT, he will just ignore you and keep runing. - You open a door and you can't go in? This is bad, right? Now imagine a huge city with doors you can't go in or out. Invisible walls!- You change your merc weapon from a knife to a rifle. But, when you try to shoot a enemy he runs at him and try to stab him with a AK-47 rifle? Dude, try to pull the daim trigger!- How about a enemy shooting at you through the wall, and you can't shoot back!And that is just for start... This game is so lame that they went back to the old system and release the Jagged Alliance Flashback after this one.			"

												This is fun. Everything bad you have heard about it is true:- Very unbalanced (enemy goes from farmers with knives to elite seal, delta, gamma, omega, epsilon operator that can snipe  your dudes or dudettes on the other side of the map whilst standing and using a machinegun on full auto, in like no-time)- Going back to protect captured points suck (but just capture the southern SAM station and place a team there)- The combat system does not play as well as a turn-based system does- WHY WOULD YOU NOT HAVE QUICKSAVE???- Why would so-called top-shelf mercs go into a combat zone without a couple of millions in their budget? Iz stopid..- And why can't they hit♥♥♥♥♥♥Still, it's fun! "

												Although having an interesting setting (conquering an island with recruited mercenaries), game fails to deliver, mostly because of unclear controls : it's hard to understand what's going on, and ultimately, it seems it doesn't really matter anyway.This game, like many others, would have beneficed from having a tutorial about how to build tactics & actually play that game, instead of only about teaching you what each button does.My main beef against this game was the following situation : by night, I approached a mining complex. My men were prone in the darkness, 2 of them armed with assault rifles, 1 with a shotguns and 2 with good handguns. The enemies were on lower height, in full light, with poor handguns, standing. They didn't run for cover when I started to shoot at them. They didn't need to, they decimated my team before I could kill more than a couple of them... Bummer... :-/After that, I just reloaded, and walking around the complex, killing the guards 1 by 1, without anyone wondering why there were gunshots around.There's no special abilities, no suppressing fire (coz all fire is suppressing but you don't know by how much), so that unrealistic gameplay doesn't have any depth nor special things...I read a walkthrough, and apparently, you can stealth with 2 men armed with handguns for many missions. It's not what I expected and wanted to do in this game.			"

												Note, If you are a fan of JA, look at something else. If you are a fan of this, just go away, you will not like what I have to say about this sad, sorry, S.O.B. of a game. Most of my game time is because I left the game on overnight and did not notice until the next morning.I want to give this a good review, I really do. But in good concience, I can't. In fact I hate the blasted thing. And I have been putting off writing this in hopes that it would be fixed, but so much for that. This is the first Jagged Alliance game I have ever had  and at first I liked it, then I actually began playing it. The game is frought with bugs, logic failures and factual errors, alot of them. To begin with the game will crash ittermitantly for no particular reason and it is not my rig (MSI Redline modified by XoticPC). Then there are the other little annoying things, character pictures go all fuzzy and you sometimes pop around the map with lag, but I could live with that if it wern't for the gameplay. Oh god, here it comes. Your characters are absoutly clueless and need major micromanaging to keep them on target. You literally have to hold their hands through every single encouter. Who to aim at, kneel, stand, run, where to go ect. I would not be suprised if they needed instruction on how to wipe their virtal hinies. They will not even return fire unless given explicit orders to fire at a specific target. I can hear you yelling at me through your screen, ""Use the Guard Mode!"". Yes, you could use the guard mode but that does not use the full range of the weapon only acone of what the character can ""see"". With fog of war on this makes sense, with it off, not so much. Another problem, if you order them to move to a location and the dinkleberry pathefinder system doesn't think they can fit in just right, they bounce around in the space like so many pinballs cought between a pair of bumpers. In a combination of these two problems, you can actually kill off your whole squad with friendly fire. If you have lets say six guys lined up behind cover and somebody pops up on your flank while guard mode is on, the far character will actually drill rounds through the rest of the squad like a 10 year old playing CoD. Moving on to the other  bits, few of the vanilla guns have proper names, all grenades, cannon shots and tank rounds look like smoke grenades and the reloading is a bit too short for mgs. But the most game breaking thing about this is also the biggest logical error. If you leave the enemy alone long enough, you will be facing a bunch of Navy Seals guarding a garbage dump, no kidding, I saw 6 Spec Ops (Lvl 5 enemies) looking after Queen D's rubish pile. This is just stupid for lack of a better word, there are steep learning curves then there is this. This is worse than unfair, it is just totally illogical. It makes not sense to sit your best guys on your least important junk. I'm sorry but this just kills the game.For those like myself that like comprehensive stuff, I'll break it down.Concept 8/10I like the Idea behind the game, lead a gurrillia war against an opressive dictator with mercs and liberate the country, in other words, every JA game in the cookie oven. Still, it had so much potential and was dropped it in the mud. Tsk, tsk.Graphics 6/10They are not bad but are way under par for a title like this made a scant 3 years back. The whole thing just feel kind of janky. This inculudes the buggy gliches and whatnot.Interface 5/10Even worse than the graphics, still feels cheap and lacks fluidity to the placement to the buttons and some thigs are missing totally from the interface.Stability/Moddability 3/10Mods can be found for this If you look for them, but there are not that many, also, this does not have workshop available. When you do find a mod, only use one, mabe two if they are dissimilar because this is buggy as is and mods are notthe best thing to throw at something like that. Some mods do correct some of the problems with the game, but I have yet to find one that can fix that stupid enemy generator. I run a realism one to correct some of those aforementioned errors but that is like empting the ocean with a pale and shovel. And a good modder should not have to make up for the numerous♥♥♥♥♥♥ups by the devs.Gameplay -10/10Yes, I said negative 10, if you don't like that, tuff turkey. This just kills it for me, like I said above, there are aspects of the game that just make you want to hit something. Incredibly frusterating and totally illogical. The enemy just steamroles you if you do not skip about 70% of the areas and make a mad dash for the finish line. Yes,you can skip most of the game and just go for the jugular, but what is the bloody point of the game if you are just going to end it in 5 game days anyway? P.S. The DLCs are a rip off.Conclusion (11/5)/10 I ain't breaking out a calculator for this. Bad, it's just bad.So, the game could have been much better if the Devs game a darn. But as I played the game, I felt that the game had alot of rough edges, almost like it was done very quickly on a beer budget while trying to make a champagne title. Many of the aspects do not make sense and the map looks like an ink blot on constuction paper. In other words, this could be better played if you had Seal Team 6 an a couple of helicopters.  Now I know I am going to get a lot of ""learn to play"" BS out of the fans of this game, I have one thing to say to you, shut up. If somebody was shooting at you and you had a rifle in your hand would you just sit and stare into space? No you would pull the trigger and not wait for someone to tell you to do it. (Well, I would, if you have a 1000 plus hours on this game, lets face it, you live in your mom's basement and would soil yourself and have a heart attack if someone shot at you). Final take away, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!! If you want an RTS that has pause and has some RPG elements and feels like a gurrilla type thing, I got nothing for you, can't think of a thing for you sorry.Update: I have found a mod combo that does make this better and have found it to be more playable. However that does not change my views of the base game for which this review is for.			"

												One day, in Germansburg, Germany, a man sat down in a room full of other men and said 'How about we remake Jagged Alliance 2, but then strip out basic features that made the first game great, ignore the community, and then drop support?' The men around the room looked at each other with stern German faces, until one said 'Who the ♥♥♥♥ is this English guy?' in German, and had the crazy Anglophone dragged from the room. Not being ones to shy away from taking an easy out, however, the Germans took the idea and ran with it, and released a modern strategy game that is mechanically inferior to a game released in 1999.

												A truly awesome game that, honestly, does feel like a JA game, though not really in the same realm as JA2. That ol' fella is the bar, and BiA does a decent job trying to get there. Okay, it doesn't really have the strange, memorable dialogue of old (though, ironically, the mercs are the same!), and the AI could stand to be improved, and maybe, just MAYBE, you NEED mods to play this, but I definitely got my money's worth, and more.

Then they said it couldnt be done and a 14 year old modder did it within 3 days of the game's launch. The kid, sadly, stopped updating and the game hasnt seen ANY official fixes, only DLC.

												That's by far the worst Jagged Alliance Sequel ever. I don't understand, like many people already mentioned, why they can't just copy Jagged Alliance 2 with better graphics. That would be way better and even cheaper to produce than all this crap they produced the last years. This game is in fact pretty much like a copy of Jagged Alliance 2, but without round based battles and every time you change your weapon you also have to reattach the scope and you can now only attach one part to your guns (scope, laser, etc) while you could attach many of them in older games. I really don't understand how it is possible to mess up a game that much.			"

												Well, as a huge Jagged Alliance fan I tried so hard to get to enjoy this game...You know these bad console ports? Yeah... this feels exactly like it. Clunky UI. No adjustable mouse/keyboard bindings. Rotating the map makes you want to smash your monitor against the wall and you have to keep fiddling with it because the world entities are so small you can easily overlook them, oh and the indicator icons for useable objects get hidden by overlaying world objects... Trees, leaves, pillars.. you name it.There are many interesting ideas in this game that could be awesome but someone forgot to add the finshing touch and they remain clunky/complicated and messy... 3 words that pretty much sum up entire game interface.A pity, this could have become a worthy JA successor.

You can play action-point based or realtime and it has other game mode functions so you can customize too. The game may look a bit insane in the menus and controls, it also looks kind of boring at first glance on the videos and advanced (you need to keep track of many things), yes, you need to, but it's easy as hell when you know it, you'll learn it fast, and when you can handle everything it is really nice and fun game when being alone in the weekends :)			"

												I really enjoy this game, and have put many hours into it.Let me first say, I haven't played too much of the original JA. A lot of the hate tends to do with ""This is nothing like the original"". Regardless I still find this a great game.Bugs be damned though. Many times I have the discourse of ""God dammit I told you to run!!!"". or ""How the F*** Are they hitting me for half damage and I cant even get a shot off?""  Getting suited for various missions, where unless I have suited my mercs for each various encounter ahead of times, I'm always having to run back to the airport to change for whatever missions (Night, Desert, Woods, Urban) but sometimes the time it take from airport to combat, your are ill prepared (Stock up for a night mission, arrive during the day).I think this game takes a lot to master, however It has been fun, and has given me hours of enjoyment.I did buy this with a bundle pack ($6 for the game and DLC). I'd would say this game and it's DLC's are a good $20 well spent, but nothing more.			"

												Since I bought it only recently, I cannot say anything about the bugfest it probably was. In my 67 hours of Liberating Arulco it crashed only 2 times. It is a worthy remake, and I recommend it! Sure, some of the things could be done better/ differently - but it is fun!Pro:- a lot of freedom of how-to-proceed- ...how to kill- ...and which mercenaries to hire- side missions- JA!!!!Con:- you find a lot of details of how-it-could-be-done-better, and get angry that these tiny changes aren´t there- difficult at first, easy once you have a dream team- really stupid AI- your team is not clever either- no aliens :-(			"

												Well, I played Jagged Alliance 1 + 2 ages ago. These games are classics! When I read the reviews of this version, I thought  omg this doen't look good. But when I saw that the bundle was on sale, ok, why not! Let's try this! I'm happy that I bought it. It's different when you played the first two Jagged Alliance but it will grow on ya. Now, I only play the game with Realistic Rebalancing Mod, because it fixes bugs, ads weapons etc.+ graphics looks nice+ healing + repairing is instant+ exp system, whenever you do something, you gain xp+ tactical screen is nice+ you don't have to pay the mercs overy week, just one fee+ autosave at start level and before every combat event- you can't create your own merc anymore- you can only repair guns, so no repairing armor etc.- only one weapon slot (for silencer or scope), so you can't do both			"

												A lot of people seem to hate this game becuase it is too different from its predecessors and to some extent I can see what the complaints are about, however I don't think the game is as bad as people claim. Before I wrote this review I went back to Jagged alliance and Jagged alliance 2, loved both those games and played them a lot (btw the ui in those two games haven't aged well, specially the first game).Jagged Alliance Back in action is more of a spiritual succesor rather than a ""Jagged Alliance 3"" and for that I think they did a decent job. The ui is much better than previous installments and the real time combat (which you can pause to give orders) is a refreshing additon that makes the game feel more fluent than previous installments. That being said I am a big fan of the Xcom remake by Firaxis and I can see the potential of turnbased combat done well. A future installment of Jagged Alliance could possibly add a optional feature where you could play ""old school"" with turnbased or real time. I don't find this to be a big issue.What I do think is a big issue with this game is lack of ""finishing touches"", kind of poor item configuration and lack of modifications such as in previous installments (i.e. combining different materials to make new items or improve current items). By finishing touches I am referring to items that seem to have the wrong stats (there are mods that reconfigure items to the proper stats and ammo type), there's a ton of useless items in game that have no use at all (During my first playthrough it took me quite some time to figure out the clock and broken controller couldn't be applied to C4 to make a bomb). The game lacks many features that would have been handy, such as improved tooltip, an option to carefully open doors (since every enemy on the map seem to hear you when you open a door for some reason), an actual sneak system (you know as in previous installments). The tool tip in the game doesn't really give much info, i.e. the different traits that the mercs have don't actually mention what bonuses they get for i.e. ""Expert Melee"" (Another thing that mods sorted). One of the features I really miss is the ability to train your mercs, which is really needed for most of the mercs you recruit from Arulco (or you'll end up with a lot of ""mules""). You could obviously train them by having them fight, repair or act as medic, but most of them have so poor stats that they can't do any of that decently.Controls are good, I like the tactical system where you can give your mercs several commands and even sync their movements, however their pathfinding is horrible. More than once I've setup my mercs for an ambush while the last guy tries to run over people rather than around them and mess up my setup (since after a while the one being run up against moves to let the idiot pass). The fact that you never have to sleep is handy but unrealistic and makes the game faster paced than it should be. Rather than sleeping you can simply give your mercs something to eat to regain stamina. My ""elite"" squad didn't sleep for 7 days straight while they went from sector to sector and cleared it all out (and since there are plenty of medical supplies and food this was never an issue). The resting system from previous installments forced you to be more tactical about your choices, so you wouldn't be vulnerable during your main squads downtime. The music in the game is ok, works well with the combat and at least I didn't get bothered by it in the long run. I think the reason I like this game so much is more about the potential it has/had rather than the actual outcome. It had so much potential, but it seems almost as if the developers didn't have time to finish the game, it certainly lacks polish.If you enjoyed this game I recommend trying out Jagged Alliance Crossfire, pretty much the same game but with a new mission. There are also some dlcs with just a tactical map mission (I tried one of them which was with Igor, Shadow and Fox), was quite fun but lasts you for about 30-60min depending on your playstyle).If you do play this game my suggestion is play on hard since normal is simply too easy (keep in mind this is a tactical game your mercs are not rambo) and when you have finished the game try one of the good mods i.e. Realistic mod by Killatomate (http://www.moddb.com/mods/realistic-rebalancing-mod), which sorts out many of the issues I've mentioned.

												This game seems to polarize players, but I for one LOVE it. There are few good tactical squad level games out there, and this is one of the best. It bridges the gap between real time and turn based nicely, and offers many hours of enjoyment. It does have some bugs, but most of those are soved via mods (the one by Killatomate is my favorite) "

												I've played almost 100h with this product, So you can definitely see that I liked it.I played JG2 in the past. It was very hard game, with strong team management and fruitfull (and very frustratic) battles over all places in Arulco. Sinde then, any many many mods we all waits for an other step into the genre.Instead of next step we have simply remake. It has very nice graphic, and new deep of battles density thanks to plan'n'action game style. Please, take a note: this is not RTS game, your boys and girls dies bloody fast (and aims terribly bad). You need to use covers, silence killing, melee skills, land mines and everything you can got from you squads (automated rocket rifle rocks!). On this part I haven't found many bugs (most likely game is well patched now), only one frustratic bug:When your mercs are in small space, AI have very big issues to avoid collissions. I don'd need to explain that such situation during firefight usually ends with save loading or with farewell to your wonderfull killers.Of course in compare to the previous JA game (especially JA2), this product have some not implemented features, and that  makes game too easy on management level (especially if you don't want to speed up too much like me):- Merc contract NEVER ends - so if you play a long game, it's quite easy to have almost all mercs (obviously some of them don't want to work with each other)- Mines resources (so also your income) never ends.I hope, I don't need to explain that without such limitations, you end up with stack of useless money (I've ended with 900k), for which you're buing repair kits, special ammo or Guardian vests at best. Most of the weapon or ammo, or even bunch of granades are easy to gather from army of dead enemies.Also If you gather good team with 2 paramedics and 1 Sniper (I've used my Amazon team for this with Raven, Spider, Fox, Vicki and 2 others) then you can simply go through the whole map, in the gaps between enemy zones and simply take over southern Sam site (next to Meduna). After that you can be sure that any Queen attacking party will be stopped there, and it's very easy to defend in entrance, especially with mine field.So in general: I liked game VERY much, I enjoyed the time I spent on it and for sure I'll back to it with some mods that are available over internet, but for some veterans it might be a little bit too easy, especially when you setup your ground.

												I see this game has mixed reviews so I figured I'd put in my 4 cents. I'll put the Pros/Cons at the bottom for the tl;dr version.When I first saw this game I thought the game mechanics looked interesting. The game is played in a kind of tactical overview in real-time, but it allows for you to pause everything and plan out your next moves. The game also offers quite a large list of auto-pause options such as ""When an enemy spots a team member"". I thought this was a nice touch, as it gives you peace of mind that one of your mercenaries will not waltz to their death while you try to deal with another.I started the game on hard and with enemies not visible. I feel like this adds a nice challenge, especially to those new to the genre. I can understand why people would dislike having enemies always visible on the map, it really takes away from the stealthy part of the game and makes being cautious pointless, as you know where the danger lies. So I strongly suggest to at least play with enemies hidden.There is a vast list of mercenaries that you can hire of varying degrees of skill. Of course the more skilled mercenaries will cost more, so much that you will be unable to get them until a bit later in the game. However, all mercenaries gain experience from killing enemies or doing certain actions (successfully lock picking door, healing a team member, etc.). Allowing XP to be gained not just from killing enemies is a nice touch I'd say. This allows for your medic who may not be the best shot to still level up some while taking care of your team.Maps are large and have nice detail and plenty to stumble across. The world map plays out by having squads of your mercenaries slide about as ""Squad A"" ""Squad B"" etc. You'll start with 3 to 4 mercenaries and build your way up from there. This can get a bit tedious once you have a few squads you need to manage at the same time, it also becomes a bit hectic since the enemy will be sending squads to ""Recapture"" towns/outposts that you've liberated. This is probably my biggest complaint of the game. Once you defeat all the enemies of an area it is considered ""liberated"". Once liberated there are militiamen that SHOULD defend the town that you've taken back for them. However, I've never had an instance when the militia were able to fend off invaders. Therefore, you need to go back to the conquered town and recapture it. I have seen some people say that leaving a mercenary in each town will be good enough to fend off attacks, but I haven't tried this out yet.Of course the best part of the game is the combat and not the micromanagement. There are multiple stances that each mercenary can take that will affect their aim (prone, crouch, etc.), each has its pros/cons, and you'll need to think about how your attack will play out before sending them in. In my experience I've had some cases call for a sniper while I flank with pistols/assault rifles (open field), while others have me using a flash bang and then sending in two shotgun wielding mercenaries to blast away multiple enemies that have bottlenecked into a room/hallway.The AI can be kind of dumb at times, but overall I'd say the game presents a nice challenge.Overall I'd say this game is definitely worth the price, especially if it's on sale.Pros:- A nice challenge if you have the settings right (no enemy visibility, hard)- A variety of weapons for every occasion with attachments! (Rifle w/ scope, silenced pistol, frag grenades, shotguns, etc.)- Maps are large and the ability to plan out your actions before an attack is nice (have teammates hold fire until others are in position, have some mercenaries run to flank while another draws fire, etc.)- It has been able to keep me entertained for a while, and I still come back to it.Cons:- Micromanagement can be annoying (You have to sell items from each merc's inventory, so if one merc is not near the shop, they must run to it. It's not a huge annoyance to me though.)- Militia are pretty useless. Once you capture a town I shouldn't feel 95% positive that I'm going to lose it if I venture off to complete more of the story.- Can be a bit slow to start up. I may just suck at the game, but it took me the longest time to get from 4 mercs to 5 mercs. There may be big money later in the game that I haven't gotten to yet.			"

												I honestly can't place my finger on what exactly it is about this game that keeps me coming back to it.  I just enjoy it.  The difficulty curve in the game is a little sharp (starts out really easy for a few missions and then swings way out of balance in the opposite direction a couple missions later and stays there) and sometimes characters get stuck on actions you give them (you will, at some point, scream ""I told you to get down, you [explitive deleted]!""), and the AI often charges you one at a time like a group of bad guys in a cheesey samurai/western/martial arts film, but for some reason, I've logged well over two hundred hours in the game.  Crazy.Worth noting that the Combat Evolved mod adds a ton of weapons (and balances them), armor, other equipment, new mercenaries, and rounds the sharpness out of the difficulty curve.  I highly recommend that if the base game doesn't float your boat.  About half my play time has been with that mod.I enjoy the game despite its flaws, though I would buy it when its on sale.  And no, I never played a previous Jagged Alliance.  I know I should.			"

												Playing this game on a Macbook Pro 2013. i7 2.6GHz, 16GB Ram.AVOID IT FOR MACs. The port has been done badly.I love the jagged Alliance games and when this was ported to OSX I got it. During gameplay the game, on occasion, hangs. Already over the past hour I had to force quit it 3 times.Also whats with ports to OSX being Windowed modes. Fooling us with a stretched screen is just stupid. Move your mouse to the bottom and the Dock appears, same thing for the upper border.For the view controls talk about stupid. Some controlls, like rotating the screen, you press Alt and move the mouse. SOunds Fair so lets give it a try. Well the screen rotates but the freaking mouse pointer also moves. So you have to release the Alt button, move the pointer back and cointinue turning your view.I don't get why the ""Esc"" key doesn't open the menu when in combat, or while some windows it can be used to close them and others is doesn't.Also when switching from the options menu back to the game the game takes a few seconds to register your mouse control when selecting all mercs.The Mac port isn't worth it. Avoid it. I wish I can get my money back.			"

												If you are hoping for a relaunch of the Jagged Alliance franchise its best not to look here. The game has some great point but at some point in the development process the devs decided it would be too hard to recreate the parts that most people love in JA2 and just started making their own game. Unforuntately, the game was marketed as a remake/update of JA2 and its not. Its misses the charm and wit of the original. The game even shipped without fog of war but was patched in 4 months after release. Now I have just checked the developer's forums and they seem to have given up on the game and there will be no more updates. The game is as is and now they are hinting at a Jagged Alliance 3. Unfortunately, I fear they will need to find a new audience for this game because JA2 fans should stay away. Its too bad the devs couldn't ship what was promised.			"

												This may just be the worst game I have had the displeasure to play on steam so far. The thing that really killed it for me was the camera constantly swinging the top down view all across the map with no way to fix it in place or make it follow.Was also not a fan of the lack of turns which means your guys get killed by AI before you can figure out how to give them commands properly. This isn't conducive to enjoyment while learning. Over all unless you are hardcore into this real time type of combat game I recommend staying clear. I did not also play its companion (Crossfire) which came with it as a package, so technically I have no recommendation for that but the same problems exist in both as I understand it.			"

												Well, as a huge Jagged Alliance fan I tried so hard to get to enjoy this game...You know these bad console ports? Yeah... this feels exactly like it. Clunky UI. No adjustable mouse/keyboard bindings. Rotating the map makes you want to smash your monitor against the wall and you have to keep fiddling with it because the world entities are so small you can easily overlook them, oh and the indicator icons for useable objects get hidden by overlaying world objects... Trees, leaves, pillars.. you name it.There are many interesting ideas in this game that could be awesome but someone forgot to add the finshing touch and they remain clunky/complicated and messy... 3 words that pretty much sum up entire game interface.A pity, this could have become a worthy JA successor.

												I really enjoy this game, and have put many hours into it.Let me first say, I haven't played too much of the original JA. A lot of the hate tends to do with ""This is nothing like the original"". Regardless I still find this a great game.Bugs be damned though. Many times I have the discourse of ""God dammit I told you to run!!!"". or ""How the F*** Are they hitting me for half damage and I cant even get a shot off?""  Getting suited for various missions, where unless I have suited my mercs for each various encounter ahead of times, I'm always having to run back to the airport to change for whatever missions (Night, Desert, Woods, Urban) but sometimes the time it take from airport to combat, your are ill prepared (Stock up for a night mission, arrive during the day).I think this game takes a lot to master, however It has been fun, and has given me hours of enjoyment.I did buy this with a bundle pack ($6 for the game and DLC). I'd would say this game and it's DLC's are a good $20 well spent, but nothing more.			"

												The game has a lot of potential, but the AI is irritating and tedious. Controlling your forces so they all attack at the same time when the enemy comes into range is broken, or rather just a poorly implemented game mechanic. You will have all of your squad in a defensive formation lined up and one will be fighting the enemy and dying while the rest of your squad just sits there.I don't know if I pushed into hard territories too quickly before leveling up or what, but the AI seems to have supieor armor, range, damage stats all around. I will commonly eliminate an entire enemy squad except one that is just out of my squad's range and it will kill my whole squad. I have played a lot of tactical strategies and none make me so frusterated and cussng at the game like this one. I enjoyed the game a lot and I like many of its features, but it's not worth the stress for me. I have better things to do with my time and far betetr games to play than this one. 4/10			"

(Rifle w/ scope, silenced pistol, frag grenades, shotguns, etc.)- Maps are large and the ability to plan out your actions before an attack is nice (have teammates hold fire until others are in position, have some mercenaries run to flank while another draws fire, etc.)- It has been able to keep me entertained for a while, and I still come back to it.Cons:- Micromanagement can be annoying (You have to sell items from each merc's inventory, so if one merc is not near the shop, they must run to it. It's not a huge annoyance to me though.)- Militia are pretty useless. Once you capture a town I shouldn't feel 95% positive that I'm going to lose it if I venture off to complete more of the story.- Can be a bit slow to start up. I may just suck at the game, but it took me the longest time to get from 4 mercs to 5 mercs. There may be big money later in the game that I haven't gotten to yet.			"

												It's only a shell of the original. The map controle sucks. Not a bad game but not JA2. I wish they had just improved the look of the old game and left the rest alone. The lap top isn't even a lap top. Not a bad game but a poor remake of JA2.			"

												I remember playing a previous edition of this game. This game has been played a lot, good value but somewhat repetitive. I took my time playing and that was probably not a good choice. I was good at the tactical level but too slow/bad in the strategic one. Still had good challenges, the 3D terrain can sometimes be hard to use to your advantage as you spin the camera around.			"

												This review will cover the vanilla game and the highly recommended Realistic balence mod.Vanilla:I dont recommend you play the game stock like this, why you ask? Well... Cons:The difficulty will spontanious ramp up half way through and leave you screwed.RNG does not help AT ALL and you end up missing point blank shots.RNGHard to make money if you're new.Amoungst other stuff, but that would be more of a strategy game problem(Ai stupidity...etc)Now, I wouldn't recommend this if their weren't any pros.Pros:You can customize your units as you please, your favorite guns, outfits, etc.Set up ambushes, defend your bases, and have the ability to leave the area at will.(If not in combat)Being able to leave the area means you can actually run around out the map, to the world map and flank enemies on the outer flanks.(If you buy the game you'll see what I mean)Ai doesnt hesitate to put up a fight.And more...MODDED:YES, GET THE REALISTIC BALENCE MOD, ONLY WAY TO PLAY.All in all, buy it, play a vanilla play through, when you're done raging, get the mod and have fun.

												True tactics that's what I love in this game. If you do everything right, set proper orders for your troops, and turn off tactic pause - battle can last only seconds. It's not that ridiculous turn-based battle, where even you have everything under control you have to wait every turn (now I understand why somebody likes auto-battle). Especially when there are tons of enemies. I've been fond of real-time tactics since Fallout Tactics.On the other hand it's erally dull game. Old heroes, old idea, but it's not a remake! There is no sense in many things. For instance we kill a relative of main villain to free children in the factory, ut after that they stay there (working now for revolution). Or you can hit twice when it's 'unlikely to hit' but can't hit when it's 'certain hit'.6/10 But I like where tactics genre's going			"

The plan-and-go system is excellent, graphics are pleasing and the voice overs, although they will never match the original are adequate. The only draw back is the lack of a character creation. Creating your own character was half the fun in Jagged Alliance 2. Without that, I feel less connection to the game.			"

												Updated Review 1 November 2014--------------------------------------------------I change to recommended because I have spend 100+ hours on this game and I enjoy this game as long as I set my mind this game is just some sort of real time tactical squad game with pause (RTwP) with no personality. It might taste bland but this is offset by some cool graphics and nice level design. I was expecting some underground level but hey this is good enough to be enjoyed. If this game use turn based combat and adopt true mercenery personality, this game can be a true successor of Jagged Alliance 2 but it is not. I get this game collection for 4 bucks and I think I get my money worth for all the time I spend on the game. If developer don't make proper sequel of JA2, so be it. Life sucks anyway.  Old Review (Not Recommended)-------------------------------------------------If I have to describe this game in a single sentence I'll have to say this game doesn't capture the essence of what makes Jagged Alliance a great game - interesting characterization and challenging combat. Though technically this Back In Action (BIA) games is superior in term of graphic and some of level design are good, it fails royally in other aspect which makes JA1 and JA2 a great game.OK lets see what the developer of this game failed:1) Cumbersome combat system. I don't mind playing this game as real time combat game but the implementation of this system in the game is so mediocre it ruins the game. The camera keep changing during pause while really annoys me. I think I spend a lot of time fixing the camera view than actually playing the game which kind of shame. 2) Weak characterization in term of dialog, voice over and portrait. I'm quite baffled why the developer can't just reuse the old voice over which is great. That's one of the biggest selling feature of old Jagged Alliance games. The new dialog and voice over is horrible by Jagged Alliance standard. Lets not even talk about that 3D portrait (only Spider looks good). It looks odd and playing with cumbersome combat and sub-standard voice over, you wonder is this really Jagged Alliance that used to be a great game?Simply put, this is not a Jagged Alliance games. Only in name but not in the spirit of what makes Jagged Alliance a great game. I'm trying to finish this game but I can't promise that.			"

												Playing this game on a Macbook Pro 2013. i7 2.6GHz, 16GB Ram.AVOID IT FOR MACs. The port has been done badly.I love the jagged Alliance games and when this was ported to OSX I got it. During gameplay the game, on occasion, hangs. Already over the past hour I had to force quit it 3 times.Also whats with ports to OSX being Windowed modes. Fooling us with a stretched screen is just stupid. Move your mouse to the bottom and the Dock appears, same thing for the upper border.For the view controls talk about stupid. Some controlls, like rotating the screen, you press Alt and move the mouse. SOunds Fair so lets give it a try. Well the screen rotates but the freaking mouse pointer also moves. So you have to release the Alt button, move the pointer back and cointinue turning your view.I don't get why the ""Esc"" key doesn't open the menu when in combat, or while some windows it can be used to close them and others is doesn't.Also when switching from the options menu back to the game the game takes a few seconds to register your mouse control when selecting all mercs.The Mac port isn't worth it. Avoid it. I wish I can get my money back.			"

												This may just be the worst game I have had the displeasure to play on steam so far. The thing that really killed it for me was the camera constantly swinging the top down view all across the map with no way to fix it in place or make it follow.Was also not a fan of the lack of turns which means your guys get killed by AI before you can figure out how to give them commands properly. This isn't conducive to enjoyment while learning. Over all unless you are hardcore into this real time type of combat game I recommend staying clear. I did not also play its companion (Crossfire) which came with it as a package, so technically I have no recommendation for that but the same problems exist in both as I understand it.			"

												This game is presently almost unplayable in Linux. The behavior of the cursor is completely unpredictable, which makes precise movement nearly impossible. More often than not, the cursor will simply appear as the ""no"" sign, which also renders most actions (most critically the field of view cone) unusuable. My entire, well-armed squad just got wiped by a single hostile with a pistol, simply because I couldn't force my team to face in the correct direction.

												One of my all time favorite games! It's simply a very great game! If you liked the old Jagged series, well this is abit different because you can actually choose the game mode you want. You can play action-point based or realtime and it has other game mode functions so you can customize too. The game may look a bit insane in the menus and controls, it also looks kind of boring at first glance on the videos and advanced (you need to keep track of many things), yes, you need to, but it's easy as hell when you know it, you'll learn it fast, and when you can handle everything it is really nice and fun game when being alone in the weekends :)			"

												I see this game has mixed reviews so I figured I'd put in my 4 cents. I'll put the Pros/Cons at the bottom for the tl;dr version.When I first saw this game I thought the game mechanics looked interesting. The game is played in a kind of tactical overview in real-time, but it allows for you to pause everything and plan out your next moves. The game also offers quite a large list of auto-pause options such as ""When an enemy spots a team member"". I thought this was a nice touch, as it gives you peace of mind that one of your mercenaries will not waltz to their death while you try to deal with another.I started the game on hard and with enemies not visible. I feel like this adds a nice challenge, especially to those new to the genre. I can understand why people would dislike having enemies always visible on the map, it really takes away from the stealthy part of the game and makes being cautious pointless, as you know where the danger lies. So I strongly suggest to at least play with enemies hidden.There is a vast list of mercenaries that you can hire of varying degrees of skill. Of course the more skilled mercenaries will cost more, so much that you will be unable to get them until a bit later in the game. However, all mercenaries gain experience from killing enemies or doing certain actions (successfully lock picking door, healing a team member, etc.). Allowing XP to be gained not just from killing enemies is a nice touch I'd say. This allows for your medic who may not be the best shot to still level up some while taking care of your team.Maps are large and have nice detail and plenty to stumble across. The world map plays out by having squads of your mercenaries slide about as ""Squad A"" ""Squad B"" etc. You'll start with 3 to 4 mercenaries and build your way up from there. This can get a bit tedious once you have a few squads you need to manage at the same time, it also becomes a bit hectic since the enemy will be sending squads to ""Recapture"" towns/outposts that you've liberated. This is probably my biggest complaint of the game. Once you defeat all the enemies of an area it is considered ""liberated"". Once liberated there are militiamen that SHOULD defend the town that you've taken back for them. However, I've never had an instance when the militia were able to fend off invaders. Therefore, you need to go back to the conquered town and recapture it. I have seen some people say that leaving a mercenary in each town will be good enough to fend off attacks, but I haven't tried this out yet.Of course the best part of the game is the combat and not the micromanagement. There are multiple stances that each mercenary can take that will affect their aim (prone, crouch, etc.), each has its pros/cons, and you'll need to think about how your attack will play out before sending them in. In my experience I've had some cases call for a sniper while I flank with pistols/assault rifles (open field), while others have me using a flash bang and then sending in two shotgun wielding mercenaries to blast away multiple enemies that have bottlenecked into a room/hallway.The AI can be kind of dumb at times, but overall I'd say the game presents a nice challenge.Overall I'd say this game is definitely worth the price, especially if it's on sale.Pros:- A nice challenge if you have the settings right (no enemy visibility, hard)- A variety of weapons for every occasion with attachments! (Rifle w/ scope, silenced pistol, frag grenades, shotguns, etc.)- Maps are large and the ability to plan out your actions before an attack is nice (have teammates hold fire until others are in position, have some mercenaries run to flank while another draws fire, etc.)- It has been able to keep me entertained for a while, and I still come back to it.Cons:- Micromanagement can be annoying (You have to sell items from each merc's inventory, so if one merc is not near the shop, they must run to it. It's not a huge annoyance to me though.)- Militia are pretty useless. Once you capture a town I shouldn't feel 95% positive that I'm going to lose it if I venture off to complete more of the story.- Can be a bit slow to start up. I may just suck at the game, but it took me the longest time to get from 4 mercs to 5 mercs. There may be big money later in the game that I haven't gotten to yet.			"

I would not mind seeing this mechanic again.The campaign is classic JA...to a fault,,,but it's been such a long time since I played JA that this was a nice way to re-experience the game.This is a long, hard, grueling campaign, but I finished it and loved it.

												I know this game is becoming dated (released in Feb 2012), but if you are looking for a game with nearly endless replay abilities (achievable by trying the game with different mercenaries) that you can stop gameplay, save, and do something else at any point without missing a beat this is for you.  I would recommend installing a player MOD to further enhance the gameplay (available on the net for free -  from Combat Evolved (search ""jabia combat evolved"" to find it from Bing or Google, and then make some of your own edits by ""adjusting"" files in c:/ProgramFiles(x86)/Steam/Steamapps/common/JABIA/bin_win32/configs (Use care to keep copies of your originals and don't expect any support for changes made this way) you are in for a long playable game that will have you cracking up!  By the way, Fox is a riot!			"

												Great mix of Action-strategy, story could be made better, levels are original and offer multiple ways how to complete them, AI is sometimes kinda dumb, but can ale surprise. Great continuation of old commandos by my oppinion			"

												No fog of war, which sucks, and the GUI definately needed extra work.Basic principles are still sound though and you never get too old to enjoy putting down your enemies at 100+ meters with a head shot!			"

												Brings back many fond memories.  They removed many nice features of JA2 but did add some new stuff.  Overall, while disappointing (to a hardcore JA2 fan) this is still the best game of this type to be released in many years.			"

												""Jagged Alliance - Back and buggy"" could be the title for Mac & Linux version. Quit playing the game after the game froze & destroyed the savegame file. You can have many saves, but it will not help you since it is only one savegame file. All your eggs in one basket... Are we supposed to use timemachine on the savegame folder?			"

												Jagged Alliance - Back in Action.I wish I could say something nice about this game, I really do, but I can't.Jagged Alliance 2 was a groundbreaking game that was years ahead of it's time. They used the faces of real people as the models for the characters, and then rendered them, much like modern games, and had some of the best voice acting to give your mercs some personality. This game doesn't have either of these two things.JA2 also used a Turn Based Strategy gameplay that had you gripping your mouse and keyboard going ""♥♥♥♥♥♥shit♥♥♥♥♥♥ did I make the right call?"", and this game doesn't have that either.I have NEVER been more disappointed by anything in my entire life. Developing this game was the worst insult anybody could have done to the JA series, and buying it is a great was to lose your money.Watching the Starwars Prequels and playing DNF straight after is a better use of your time.

												Especially from version 1.13 on this game brings good ol' Jagged Alliance atmosphere back, granted in a different way. But I like the new stop & play mode, got used to it by UFO Aftermath. Give this game a chance and don't listen to all the critics, most  of them have played a very early build, but almost all annoyances are gone now.			"

												Ah the good ole days.  Great game for turn based RPG.  RNG monster isn't always against you.  I wouldn't recommend melee combat.  Even with a great merc with perfect stealth you often don't one shot a mob and they end up doing serious damage to your sneaking merc.  Much easier to get close and use a silenced handgun.  Game gets extremely easy after a couple play throughs when you realize you can pretty much sneak to zones you shouldn't be in to get the best weapons in the game way too early.  It is possible to win the entire game with 1-2 mercs.  Not bashing this game at all.  I love it completely.  Really wish there would be a newer one come out with updated graphics and game engine.

												The voice acting is on par with 80's B movie action flicks, which has got to be what they were going for because no one does voice acting this bad on accident. The gameplay is alright, although sometimes I think the AI must be mentally handicapped as they won't react to things going on around them. All in all it is somewhat of a slow grind, that you could skip by just running to the final objective and finishing the mission. I recommend doing it this way so you could refund in the 2 hour window.			"

Will not spend 29.99 to not be able to play though. Looking into donating 30 bucks to Kalypso for the game and will continue to play other version.			"

												I play this game on a Mac and can only review it on the mac. I've always wondered how someone can have 50 hours in a game and not recommend it... well now I understand. BUGS! I actually really enjoy this game and the tactical rts/rpg elements, however the game is too buggy and eventually became unplayable after all my saves became corrupted then plain dissapeared. I struggled through the bugs ti complete 55% of the game when my many saves just vanished. ProsFun tactical rts style gameplay with pausedecent level up system with rpg feel. you can allocate points to stats or skills as you gain expwide variety of weapons (many of which just do not work as intended ie rpg has no blast radius)lots of locationslarge selection of mercsConsBugs galore. including but by no means limited to: All items dissapear (this bug is tough and even loading a previous save somehow does not restore the lost items.) Unable to enter any buildings in certain towns. Game locks up when interacting with certain NPCs.Characters sometimes do what you tell them...sometimes they just don't (seems not to be affected by increasing stats)  weapon stats such as range do not apply correctly (you will have a sniper rifle which will be out-ranged by enemy pistol) Many, Many more...but you get the idea.... lots of bugs.Voice acting. A couple characters have decent or funny voices...but some of them are unbearable. Tip: Do not choose the merc ""Fox""as your first merc...she will drive you insane. Broken achievements: Many easy ones do not work others work when they shouldn't. ex I tossed a gas grenade... it hit a tree, even though the path for it indicated it would not hit the tree...the grende dropped at my feet and killed me... the achievemnet for killing a tank with the rocket launcher ticked! Haha, I had not even owned one at this point.Icons often do not change after switching weapons.so many things do not work as intended, or not at allOther thoughtsI had not played any other Jagged Alliance title, so I can't compare to previous releases... but I had fun with this game despite the bugs. I got it in a bundle and probably spent under one dollar on it...so I certainly got my money worth, but I can't recommend it with all the bugs and especially the saves corrupting. I got my moneys worth, although I would say, don't spend more than a few bucks on this AND be ready to encounter a wide variety of bugs that may or may not make the game unplayable. Certainly think twice about purchasing if you plan to play on a mac			"

												This game is nothing like Jagged Alliance 2. The only thing remotely similar is the main plot but only loosely. There is no more fog of war, no action points or turn system. They have dropped I.M.P, the website where you could make your own mercenary, and skills are no longer learned by performing the action, but instead are alloted once your mercenary levels up. The only way to recognize your favorite mercenary is by their name;their portraits are completely different. I would not recommend this game to a serious Jagged Alliance fan.			"

												This is far from the quality of the old Jagged Alliance titles. It has the name but the combat system is extremely poor. For example, you need to order your mercenaries to fire back when they get shot at and you have to do it for each and everyone one of them all the time. There is a lot more that just does not work out. It lacks atmosphere and intuitive controls. They took the same setting and story as in JA2 but the delivery is much worse. Do not buy this, it is a waste of time! I had to play JA1 again to see if it maybe was just me but I ended up playing through JA1 and JA2 again and can now assure you that this new game is a failure.			"

												I like this game, chareters are fun and the programmable actions are awesome. Most of the action is also good and if you plan your actions well it can be very satisfying. Most guns feel satisfying to shoot with. When this game is fun it can be really fun.BUT:This game gets repetitive and boring really fast, ironically mostly because of it's dynamic events. Maybe if AI would do something else than try to capture the same hub over and over again every day with same brainless frontal congaline charge it would not be so boring. It's fun and all, but as everything looks and feels the same it's fun only for so long that you manage to get the best gear and money is no longer an issue.To me biggest issues are idiotic AI, repetition and somewhat shallow content. DLC's are a joke, do not buy them, what you get is something you get in the first 2 to4 hours anyway and you wont be using that crappy peashooter too long. So not worth it.I feel that it's still worth the money even with it's shortcomings, but I do understand people who dont like it.			"

												Thumbs up because I found a Mod that makes it all work.http://www.moddb.com/mods/realistic-rebalby KillatomateIt fixes a lot of the issues, rebalances the play, and the best thing, makes silencers, camo, sneaking, and all that stuff viable and plausable! Theirs a few other mods out there, but they were not my cup of tea.Vanilla tho, unless you like real time movement, command, action, type stuff, then you might wanna stay clear of this. It does take a bit getting used to if you are not used to it. Fortunatly that also means it makes precious split seconds count. That .05 could be the difference betweeen taking an ax to the chest or popping off the guys head, or putting a bullet in his legs so you could finish him off. I put in about 60 hours of vanilla play in this and the rest is modded. I highly sugest playing it modded.			"
