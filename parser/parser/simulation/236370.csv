			Setting off to another camp for a secondary course. What a wonderful Xmas gift. (Sarcasm)		


'Quick' & simple review:Pros: Dedicated developers, even if progress on the game is slow. (For goodness' sake, it's a small indie studio!) Plus great community managers! Generally mature, close-knit, and wonderful community. (I must warn you, a few black sheeps exist.) Intentionally challenging game mechanics: (devs are aiming for realism) No HUD crosshairs,  real weapon recoil,  hearing impairment after taking damage (with disabled HUD until you recover),  dynamic character breathing (which affects gun wobble),  limited movement speed and hampered jumping,  no checkpoints/save system in campaign/co-op (aka. permadeath, 'cuz it's hardcore),  long respawn time in PvP to force the players to be vigilant, (you can never be too careful in this game) fair & balanced PvP (for now, SMG and rifle are available, and NO KILLSTREAK BONUS, HA!),  bots are literally robots who can flank you, snipe you a mile away, and make you wish you are wearing adult diapers on harder difficulties. Innovative game mechanics:  First-person simulation (no floating hands, no viewmodels, full first-person body is rendered where FP camera resides... and that helmet faceplate you see in first-person? Yep it's a real in-game, in-environment model too)wtf, the HUD too?,  dynamic crouch & cover system,  changing  environments and game states. Dynamic maps! (This deserves repetition!)(Laugh as a wall rises to block your opponent off, or ragequit when a ninja jumps on you.) Awesome audio & visuals! (Provided that your hardware can take it and max out all the settings, and it's in Unity.)Hear the water splatter around you at different places (on the ground, on your helmet, on the roof...)Watch how the water splatters on your visor (hint: slowly look up and down... if you bought this game)""...help..."" (Officially denied by the devs & CM)Check out the lighting!...and maybe many more fine details that are too damn obscure that you must pay attention to actually notice.  Tense atmosphere in both campaign/co-op and PvP.(Your flashlight may or may not be your best friend.)Cons: It's Steam Early Access. (not really a bad thing, but I guess some people don't like the notion of buying an incomplete game.) It's hungry for hardware, and not Mac/Linux-friendly ('cuz OpenGL and Unity).On my iMac: 30-60fps main menu, 15-30fps in PvP, drops to 1-5fps on NeuroGen Incident (biggest map in the game)*turn off beamsync*: OVER 90... yeah... until NGI, it drops to 5fpsSwitch to Bootcamp Windows 7: 40-100fps main menu, cool 30fps in PvP, 20-30fps on NGI... not bad.*switch from DirectX to OpenGL*: screw this... OpenGL & Unity hate each other.Machine: Intel i5 2.5GHz, AMD Radeon HD 6750M 512 MB, 8 GB RAM Plenty of bugs to stomp (which I actually enjoy, but then, again…)I mean, check out the pinned post I'm keeping (or I had been keeping) in the Steam Discussions page. It's friggin' long...)Seriously. The list, although unofficial, is longer than this puny review. The official buglist is much longer.(""...where the **** is the keycard?!"" ""HOLY CRAP I AM FALLING THROUGH THE MAP!""that kind of thing. But a marine keeps his cool, no?)Server rollback has yet to be coded & implemented. (keyword: yet)Client-server feedback latency may vary for different people.If your opponent/robot manage to shoot you in the head before you can even react, blame lag. Small multiplayer population + surplus servers + high ping (in my area)Perfectly good money wasted on empty servers, IMO. No landsharks, yet.Devs are so perfectionist that they want to perfect the AI code before introducing the sharks... *hype dies out* Spoiler: Not in space, yet. (The NeuroGen Incident is a reenactment underground.)Thus, in the current state of this game:Recommended For: Gamers looking for a highly balanced and tactical FPS. Gamers looking for thrills with replay value, and tired of mediocre jumpscares. (Advice: Never play on Easy mode. It kills the atmosphere.)But this is not meant to be a horror game. It's... uhm... a test! Live by the game tagline: In space, your friends can hear you scream.Not Recommended For: Gamers used to and prefer mainstream FPS, like CS, CoD, BF etc. People who don't like buggy and incomplete indie games. Gamers who set the same high expectations like they do with heavily funded games by big publishers....which I can totally understand. This review is meant to help your research.Conclusion:All you have to decide is WILL YOU BELIEVE? "

Early Access Review
								This game as it is right now is very good and I highly recommend it, especially if you like Insurgency and System Shock 2.However, there have been a lot of misinformation being spread about this game and it's developer's, so i'll make this as short and sweet as possible:1. The IDEA of Interstellar Marines began in 2005, not the actual development.2. They launched a failed kickstarter in 2009 and recieved NO money as a result.3. That was AFTER they filed for bankruptcy due to the economic slump at the time.4. This game has been in early access since 2013, not longer, as others have said.5. The reason for the slow progress (so far) is that they literally have a handful of people working on the game, and they have so little money that they are basically working on this game for free.6. The devs are NOT abusive. If anything, they break their backs to ensure the satisfaction of their consumers.So, if you like what you see, buy it. It'll only get better from there, and it has a dedicated community. If you're holding off because it's in Early Access, at least keep an eye on it.They don't say ""For the love of the game"" because it sounds nice. They say it because they mean it.I hope this clears a few things up.EDIT: If you want the source, it's here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/236370/discussions/0/864972399686185189/ "

Early Access Review
								I always hated those people who gave up supporting the devs of Interstellar Marines and began calling the game vaporware. Game development takes time and it's not that easy, so I found it extremely annoying when someone had the audacity to blame the developers for not producing enough content. Now I'm going to join the same group. After getting my hopes up for a game that in my opinion had a vast amount of potential, there just hasn't been enough progress to make me believe in to the game anymore. After 5-6 years of supporting the devs and being generally a fan of the whole concept, I will give up on this. I am growing too old for this, figuratively and literally speaking. "

Early Access Review
								Guys, I have been waiting for this game for almost 10 years. I've supported the development by purchasing the spearhead version of the game before it was on steam and afterwards I bought it again on steam to support further. I've purchased several bagdes of support from their website and even bought some of the company shares that were on sale a few years ago. I've seen this game go through many different development stages. The game simply is not what it had been advertised as back in 2006, or maybe it was 2005. I am not sure but at any rate I do not expect it to deliver anymore. There are people who are happy with the current state of the game and I'm glad it gets support. However, as someone who has been waiting for this game since it was first announced I believe there are some things that have not been delivered. I do not expect a game that has been in develoment for this long to be the same game that it was announced as and frankly from what I've played so far that expectation might be correct. I do not recommend this game to anyone, and before you decide to buy it I would like you to be aware that this game has been in develoment almost as long as Duke Nukem Forever and that you should look into it more before you decide that you truly want it.

								The problem with this game is not that the developers are inexperienced and bad at what they do, it's the fact that they are low on money, and the community has been very negative about them being slow.  They try their hardest to communicate with their community; they have a great game already made, here.  They're trying their absolute hardest, but they just don't have the money to do it.  I do recommend this game, highly.  It has a fun and unique co-op experience, fun PvP, skins (no Microtransactions), singleplayer missions, multiple types of missions.  They aren't giving up, but without these funds, they're progressing slowly.This video tells you everything you need to know, really.

Early Access Review
								YESSS! Another GRAND update!!! This time the changes include ultra realistic, highly tactical, extremely accurate, high quality, high fiedlity, high definition, revolutionary, ground braking, one of a kind FALLING DAMAGE! Also this update includes.... NOTHING ELSE!SO HAVE FUN DEAR PLAYERS, AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING US RIP YOU OFF!Earlier reviews below.___________________________________________________________________________________So, more than a month has passed since I originally reviewed IM. A new update is out, so, I installed the game to check out if there has been any progress. (The description of the update states, that this time, the only changes are a switch to Unity 5, and some crappy map was re-added to coop, probably for the 647th time, so I didn't hold my breath...) I quickly went through NGI to assess the situation. Sadly, there is nothing good to report.No visible progress at all. One thing that did catch my attention though, was that 30 seconds after I started the level, I fell through the floor for no apperant reason... Great start (But, what else is new, right?). I restarted the level, and played a bit more. It was the first time I played this game in six months.I will now list the changes I've noticed: The voice and lines of the computer in NGI changed a bit, my guns and suit changed collor, there is a small fatigue percentage in the bottom right of the screen and a ""Hell week"" button has been added to the main menu. That's it. These are the changes made to the game during six months of development... Can't wait to try the game in another six months, and find that the fatigue percentage moved to the top left of the screen, and that two maps that were removed from coop in the last update, were returned (As usual...).The part I liked the most about this, is in the description of the update: ""The next step we want to do is improve performance even more with Speedtree and boost the graphics even more with physically based shaders, global illumination, linear lighting and deferred rendering 2.0.""YAY! The next update will be as useless as this one!The original review is below.___________________________________________________________________________________I like this game, I really do. Why won't I recommend it then? Let me explain.Currently, the game is in decent shape, with nice gameplay, nice graphics, a reasonable amount of content for the price. The problem is, the developers say it will have so much more. The ""vision"" of IM is quite grand, and it would be great if it actually happened. I just doubt it will happen... I mean, the progress is waaay too slow. Updates are few and far between (once every two-three monts), and when an update does comes out, new features are almost non-existant. Even many of the bug fixes that are stated as fixed on the changelog, are actually not fixed. It's like ""This update, we are going to release the sprinting and fatigue system! In three months we will fix the broken sprinting and fatigue system! Three months after that, we will impliment our super advanced crouching system! AND, don't forget that after six more months we will add a flash light! Our game is uber-tactical with ultra advanced and realistic (unimplimented) skin system! Land sharks are just around the corner (and have been for the last year or so)! And of course, stay tuned, because we are going to take this game (advertised as a mainly SP/COOP game) and add a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MP survival mode that no one wants, instead of focusing on the campaign or on adding more guns!""They advertise their crouching and sprinting systems as ""realistic"", ""advanced"" and ""revolutionary"", and yet I do not see how they are different from any other FPS... And this is what gets to me. This dishonesty on the part of the developers.If they would advertise the game as it is, and not throw in things they will get around to in about ten years, I would recommend it. It is pretty enjoyable as it is. But seeing as the developers are dishonest, and insist on misleading the players, I will not recommend this game!			"

Early Access Review
								Last time I put it bluntly, but because there are morons on this review page that thumbs down negative reviews (I'm sure  now we're at 3 years in Steam EA, they feel really smart), I'll go ahead and give my review a little more content. With more sodium. When I first picked up Interstellar Marines, I was hooked instantly. I thought that there was no limit, and the devs fueled that feeling with vlogs showing things to be genuinely stoked for. The idea felt fresh in a genre where literally every avenue has been explored -- be it by big game industries or indie developers -- and that nothing came as a surprise. I waited for that polish to the game, and even ended up buying 5 other copies for friends to play with me and help the game grow. ""So why did you stop, why are you giving this game a bad review?""Because these devs are slower than the skeleton crew updating DayZ Standalone. Three years in Steam EA -- with plenty more behind that -- and what do they have to show for it? A few 'missions' and tweaks that should be done after you put in content needed to call this a game. I've seen game demos more complete than this. I'm not sure if it's program regulations or your character just enjoys it, but you walk around like you have a giant metal rod up your ♥♥♥. It's clearly not beyond the dev team's capabilities to make a working movement animation or make the characters look convincing, just look at the robots running around. Speaking of robots, aside from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t multiplayer system they have in the game (try getting into a Hell Week lobby), did you know that they are the ONLY enemies you have in the entire game? After the initial fear of the unknown wears off, be prepared to delve into the dark with these bots either shooting at you or flailing their arms out you with some scream along the lines of ""HOOOOUURRRRGH"". Three years of development, and they haven't been able to ship out a single mission past 'training simulations' for the real threats in space. I know a handful of people that -- given three years only -- would be AGES ahead of what this team has brought us in updates that provide no real useful content at all. We got a PVP/E game mode now. Whooptee ♥♥♥♥ing doo. Maybe that was their message behind this game. That there was no alien threat and therefore we all look dumb, waiting to encounter alien lifeforms, weapons in hand. That's what I'm going to hope, because other than an overprice, sick, twisted prank, this game only stands as a pillar in reasons I don't EVER want to put money towards another game with an EA tag on it again.Thanks devs for betraying our trust, breaking promises and dreams, and adding into the phobia of investing into an EA that becomes a waste of cash.

								I bought this game in 2010. It's almost 2017 now and it's still just as Early Access as it ever was. The content trickles in and is lackluster at best. There are many other games available that have more content, are more fun to play and are free. I feel like I was duped by a snake oil salesmen. Promised features and content still yet to be seen 7 years later.Avoid this and don't waste your money*Edit*To those comenting on my time played, I have played this game for hours before it was available on steam. As I said, I had this game back in 2010, it has only been on steam since 2013.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has been in development for more than 6 years now, and it doesn't seem that the end is anywhere in sight.This is becoming a sort of pyramid scheme, where people who already bought the game recommend it to others just to keep the development going. :-/The developer has recently started releasing monthly updates, but those updates are mostly void of real content; they include only minor changes like tweaking the weapon recoil, or changing the HUD display font.The developer ignores any questions about the release date, and doesn't reveal anything about the single-player campaign, saying that its a surprise, or that everything's a ""means to an end"", or something vague of that sort.My guess is, sadly, that the money will run out before the game will ever be finished. I therefore would not recommend anyone buy this game in its 'early access' from.			"

Early Access Review
								This is without a doubt the longest game development I have ever seen. Over 10 years of waiting for a game that was never made. Since the release on Steam early access (over 3 years ago), there has been absolutely zero content related to the main reason people bought the game, the single player. Everything that's been released so far is bland multiplayer, and even more bland co-op. The maps are limited, the content is limited, and I couldn't be more disappointed after waiting for so long. Back in 2008 I had hopes that this game would set the standard for Indie developers, but as of May 2016, Zero Point Software have decided to find a publisher and pretty much go back on everything they've been telling us for years. I lost faith in Interstellar Marines a long time ago, but consider this review a warning. You will be disappointed.PS: If I have to read ""For the love of the game"" one more time, I'll probably put my faith in Activision. At least they release finished games.			"

								I played Slender without jumping. I played Amesia without flinching. I sat through Five Nights at Freddies and only jumped once.But this game regularly makes me actually scream, and flinch badly enough I can't aim properly. I can't place exactly what does it, or why it does it so well, but holy ♥♥♥♥ does it ever. The noises the bots make, the way they lunge for you, the absolutely jawdropping immersion. This game isn't billed as a horror, and in reality, it shouldn't be. You play a fully armored, trained Marine, with unlimited ammo, flashlights, lasers, and the most advanced weapons in the entire armed forces. It couldn't be a survival horror, or even really a horror at this rate.What it is is a very tense, tight, amazing shooter. Controls are absolutely tight (With the exception of stairwalking) weapons feel good, the lighting is top notch, and the sound is literally eargasmic. Everything combines to make a game that takes a badass fighter, and makes them seem like a very human fighter. The Marines say nothing, but you feel like you're actually there, fighting in their boots, sweating around the grips of their weapons. It's barely alpha even now, with many features missing and planned, and many bugs and issues.And yet, it's still the best first person shooter I've played. It may not be the funnest, nor the fastest, nor even the most well polished. But it's a true first person experience, injecting you into the game in a way that I've wished for in many others.			"

 Many Say this game is dead.  Forever in Dev hell. Eternal Early Access. And maybe so, but not truly dead. Please read my entire review to understand what I mean.The game mechanics are fantastic. There are so many elements to the game that make it a challenge. Versatile and ever changing environments in the middle of a battle. Is something that AAA games do not put a lot of effort into.It has both single player and multiplayer. To enjoy playing with well developed AI to fight.. They are even developed to scare the player tremendously, The bots really get my heart pumping.This game was on a hype train for a while (back in 2013 and 2014), But there are an issue. The team of devs are no longer together. Only The lead dev is working on the game, with a few out of country Volunteers. The game is still developing, but there isn't the man power to get this game going. The one developer calls this game ""His Dream"" and will spend as much time he has to make this game the best he can. Truly, this game has amazing concepts and features. But there isn't a whole lot of content at hand. If any of you trully want to see this game succeed, then go to ""Zero Point Software's"" Website and apply to work on the game. I'll put a link at the bottem. Though it says jobs, Don't expect to be paid. Like the dev said, he has a few ""volunteers"" working for him, and the game fel off the hype train. But anyone has any skills in creating games, programming, ideas, mechanics, assets creating, etc... Then join him, and help him finish his dream and a very potentially great game for everyone else. :DZPS Apply Site: http://www.zeropointsoft.com/jobs.php "

Real darkness. Clever flashlight usage needed. Scary.Bots. Real bots. Scary.Controls. Good controls. Holding a key holds, 'hitting' a key toggles crouch, aim, flashlight, laser. Hold time determines jump hight. Inventive, user-friendly.Teamwork. Needed. Do not reload at the same time. Cover all angles. Assign roles. Use voice comms.Is it fun?Yes it is.What else?Community is quite mature.Game has quality and polish already.Developer is independent, crowd funded (before KickStarter!).			"

Early Access Review
								This is an user friendly game review/in game useer manual for Interstellar marines xDDDDDInterstellar Marines, is an first person shooter game (FPS)It is yet only in the early-access stage wich means that this game may, or may not be finished. But as it seems like right now the devs will continue this game. The first impression of this game when i first saw the video that plays when you first start up the game was great. the game has great overall graphics and suits pretty much all computers (within limitations) you do not need to have an super computer to play this game and it gives good fps.In the begining you will start straight on the training course to get used to the controls.then you are on your'e own. you can choose to play either single player (story mode/campaign) or you can jump over to co-op or versus mode. but first off im gonna talk about single player:Single player means that you play versus the computer, (also called bots/Ai's)The bots in this game are well made, they seem to be ""artificial intelligent"" they detect you easier when you stand/run than they do when you crouch and move slowly.In game you will also have the options to equip lights (F), laser aim on your gun (G) or supressor (Q) when you use laser and the flashlight in game be carefull,\ because other players in game can see the laser and the flashlight (bots too)they detect you a lot more faster when you have laser and flashlight enabled. If you do not use the sound supressor on your gun, then be adviced. within a few seconds you will hear tons of robots stomping in the ground and coming sprinting towards you and ready to bash your skull in with their fists :)the envoirment in the game is mostly dark/foggy so it is hard to spot enemies as well as it is hard to stay hidden if you will have to use your flashlight. this is why i often like strobing the flashlight for few moments as it can be mistaken to be lights in game that flimmers.The thing with this game is that there are not very many guns. wich makes this game more focused on how actually skilled you are isntead of all the gear.some peopels like it. some peoples dont. the physics in the game are great. movement are well balanced as well as the gravity, in this game you do not have a bar that shows your stamina. but you still have it. so dont be sprinting around like a maniac. because this will affect how well you can aim when youre standing still as you will soon start to breathe like you have held your breath for 5 mina haha.in game you can comunicate with different players. both with text and with voice chat. voice (V) chat is more prefered as the text does not show up before you open the ""text menu"" where you writes your messages, so they do not pop up on your screen automatically.If you like to change graphics settings or general game settings and key bindings, then there is an fair ammount of options to use. and the game has a good compability to most screens. wich is quite good as i am using an 50"" tv while i play. wich can be troubling in many games.Also, every single bullet you fire in this game counts. the STATS menu will show you absolutely everything, and by saying this i mean absolutely EVERYTHINGyou can see how many bullets you have shot, how many kills, how many deaths, kill/death ratio, wich body part you have hit the most. and how many times you have hit the different body parts counted per bullet.so theres lot of room for competition with your friends about the best stats.it is also displaying what your favourite weapon is.The in game controls are easy to maneuver and is easy to get used to.If you want to play online either in co-op or in versus battles there are plenty of servers in different locations so you can use the filters to browse for servers that is filling your recuirements of ping, difficulty, game mode and so on.If you have any questions or any issues or maby even a bug report then you can just contact the devs via twitter, facebook or the steam game forum page, they are really fast at responding. and they are also really friendly.i have already reported in a few bugs that aint a big deal and they responded within 20 minutes.GG DEVS AND KEEP IT UP!so i give the support area an 10/10 points just for that.One of the biggest thigns about this game is that even it is a futuristic/sci-fi game it is still really realistic wich means things work out in the game as it would in real life, as an example: laser aim. in many games they make the laser beams a solid red beam that is highly visiblie to all players. but i real life you would not be able to see the laser beam unless theres some dust particles in the air. the more dust particles in the air, the more visiblie the beam gets.and in the game. it is just slightly visiblie as it is under normal circumstances in real life.the flashlight is dynamic light. it fades over distance and lights up the room like a real flashlight. it is not a static/flat light.BEAUTIFUL!when you run, your character starts breathing more heavily. and starts to run slower.if you get injured. your vision will become blurry and you will have an hard time to see your surroundings until you recover.in the interview of the devs they say they wanted to create this game as realistic as possiblie for sci-fi games. and they did it pretty well!in general this game is a whole lot of fun and really exciting and it is a great game and personally i have high expectations for this game as it got such big potentional to become something big and if you like fps games. then this is the game for you. in general i give this game an 8/10 points.reason i do not give it 10/10 is because of there is a few bugs, but im pretty sure this will be fixed pretty soon.the campaign does not have much of an ""story"" but this is just what i like with games.the multiplayer part is 10/10but as i said earlier. this is still an early access game. so it is not done yet and it will improove over time. it is a good buy and i do recommend this game.this is one of the best FPS multiplayer games made in a really long time.Lock'n load. and prepare for having some real fun !(i have  made an in game video wich i will post up here pretty soon)and ps: excuse my english grammar, im not from an english speaking country ;)heres my video reviev in game:

Early Access Review
								If you look at the hours I have put into this game that is pre alpha, you will see that I am continuously and thoroughly enjoying this game as it develops. I am eager to finally play the finished version no matter if it is still some time away. This game has taken me through a variety of emotions from fear, frustration, elation, and more. All of these things make it fun and challenging. It takes some time to get used to, because of some of the pre alpha anomalies.  It is like a new pair of shoes. They look good, but when you try them on, they don't fit at first. After wearing them for a while they feel great and become your favorite. Some people have problems getting used to the game, or have issues getting it running on their hardware. Just stepping over to the community with these problems and you will find a very enthusiastic and supportive dev group and player base that offer up loads of support to get you through the rough patch. This game has the makings of a great single player horror FPS, and a great multiplayer competitive shooter. Add in the ability to do multiplayer co-op, and it becomes an epic game. It has a fine balance between frantic shooter and tactical shooter. As I see the story plans unfold, I suspect I will be enveloped by an epic single player story when it is finished.As long as this game stays on the current heading, it will become a classic that everyone will remember. I have so much fun with this game that I bought it for all my closest gaming buddies.If you buy it based on this review, I only hope that you enjoy it as much as I do, or meet me on the server and let me help you work those new shoes in until they are comfortable.

Early Access Review
								This game is agressivley fair. The balance of the maps is remarkable, and the perioding changes in lighting and atmosphere really help to shake up the playing field and ensure that a team doesn't win simply by virtue of being ""on a roll"". Everyone uses the same gun, and that gun has a red-dot sight, laser pointer, and flashlight. The gun is satisfying to use and kills with relative ease. From the very beginning, I felt like I had a fair chance against anyone, and not once have I ever experienced the all-to-faimilar rage feeling of being killed in what feels like an ""unfair"" way, be it camping, quick-scoping, or improbable longshots.That being said, the game feels very slow. Movement is slower than you would expect, and my character feels sluggish overall. The feeling of awkwardness disspiates quickly, but is there nonetheless.The graphics are nothing stellar, but they are certainly pleasant and adequate. The blackness of night and the glow of the lights are beatiful, but the snow feels very cheaply done and could use some improvement. The gun is a fairly generic SMG/Assault Rifle hybrid. Player models can open their helmets but still look like generic SWAT Team members.In conclusion, the game is fun and enjoyable. Well worth $15 (or $7.50 from the Humble Store). Expect to get at least a few fun hours out of it, and hopefully a lot more as the game develops and gets more content.PS- Playing at night is probably the best experience in the game. There is a finesse to the strategy of when to use/not use your flashlight, and it feels appropriatley tense and exciting. Many ninja opportunities are present.PPS- You cannot jump or crouch, which is sort of odd, but not particularly annoying, at least for me.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is an excellent example of how early access can be a cruel world for us customers; I love the concept, but I find the product to be lacking. Sure, you could say ""Well of course the product is lacking - it's early alpha!"" but there comes a point where that ship sails and you're stuck with dreams and promises.Maybe they are still working on the bigger picture - the 'game' they pitched to me when I payed for my early access copy. Who knows? At the rate that updates are pushed out, that light at the end of the tunnel seems to never get any closer.The game in its current state is good. Just good; Your time in I.M. will consist of tension-filled SWAT style room searching and clearing, fighting robots in dark rooms and eerie spaces. The tension I.M. creates in these moments is fantastic. On more than one occasion I found myself frozen with panic, even when playing with friends in co-op, desperately trying to listen out for the direction at which a hissing robot would approach. This gets old quickly however when you've played the same mission twice or more, encountering the same dull colours I.M. seems to have in abundance. Everything looks like it's... placeholder, to be blunt; perhaps the drab, grey scenery is an artistic style choice made by the developers, and perhaps it does not appeal to my particular taste - my point is, everything looks strangely bland, as if rushed and put together as placeholder textures. Being early access, I would expect this to be standard practice for a game's aesthetics in its early stages, but when does it end? When will this be worked on? Take away the lighting and everything's just.... flat grey. It's strange that this is the case after all this time of development (some say two years).Robots are your sworn enemy in this game. Do not be mislead; there are no aliens or 'land sharks' to shoot in I.M. in its current state. The entirety of this early access game has been constructed as a 'training' simulation for when you take on the real threat. This sounds great, but.... must we really put up with 'training' for years upon years until actual meaningful gameplay comes our way? Where is this alien threat the developers speak of? When do we get to experience their beautiful vision for a game, huh? It's not there, do not expect it to be included should you buy I.M. early access.The hours that I've put into this game are not impressive. Certainly not. Despite this I feel as if I've begun to stretch my enjoyment out of this game to its breaking point (actually, I might never get the chance, as I'll tell you); No one's playing this game any more. I bought I.M. for the promise of excellent co-op gameplay - it did not disapoint, at least for my first few play throughs. Sadly, servers are now empty. This alone should be reason enough to not invest your money. Too much time has passed and not enough has happened to retain the community's interest in playing I.M..I love the concept of this early access game. Usually that should be enough to get me to give a thumbs-up for early access, but I can't, not in this case. I honestly feel like you'll be wasting your money. I.M. is moving so very slowly that I'm sure it's just not a priority for the developers any more, and will never be finished, even to a barely acceptable level.The most recent update is titled.... ""Update 21: Falling Damage"". This just about sums it up. Is this even noteworthy? In the update notes, yes, but it speaks volumes of just how slowly this game is moving.My faith in Interstellar Marines is wavering. I cannot recommend this early access game. I'm disapointed. This concept for a game is great - but that's all it still is, mostly just a concept, a promise yet to be fulfilled. "

								I can't believe I'm going out of my way to not recommend this game instead of just leaving, but I feel like it's important for players to know.Don't board this sinking ship.It's been almost nothing but groundwork, tweaks, fixes and QOL additions for nearly two years, excluding 'Hell Week' which is a survival game mode which spiced up core gameplay a little bit but left the rest of the game collecting dust. If you discount that, there's been few reasons for players to re-visit the game for more than a mission/match or two before leaving again, as content additions are so incredibly tiny. Yeah, sure, implementing systems like stamina and falling damage are important for a game, but after two long years of additions like this, there's still a bland and simple core gameplay across all game modes. No new weapons, enemies or gear that changes gameplay itself. Just more slow cautious gameplay with two and a half weapons.Players both old and new have expressed their concerns to the devs on what they're prioritising work on, only to be brushed aside pretty quickly by typical PR talk and the fanboys that agree with it. ""We need to lay all the groundwork before we can invest in other content,"" is the popular go-to for anyone bringing their priorities into question. But after two years of just groundwork, they're still refusing to add tangible content like weapons to keep players actually interested. And with a lack of interest, the servers are empty. Dead. Maybe 10 people online globally if you're lucky, 50 on an update day. But they don't seem to care, because despite this they're still pushing development on 'Hell Week', a mode designed for 30+ players in a battle royale, which is barely ever populated. And the paying, supporting players who are still here are probably wondering, ""what has all our money gone towards?"" because the devs are at the point of taking on volunteer staff. Yes, they lack animators and modellers... And if they supposedly do have some as volunteers, then they certainly aren't using them.Don't board a sinking ship. Go play Insurgency and imagine it's sci-fi, then you'll already be playing what this game is aspiring to be. Someone comment on this in three years so I can come back and see if they've added new tangible content, or if they just kept tweaking the tiniest details and systems that should be icing on the cake later.

Early Access Review
								The game had a great potential of being an atmospheric story driven Sci-Fi shooter but through the last 4 years (out of total 6 years in development) the developers went the wrong way. It seems their new goal is too make a multiplayer shooter which is a huge letdown after their previous trailers and early announcments. Right now the game has very little content to offer. A handful of multiplayer maps, two weapon models and one enemy model. Even the frequent update schedule is not helping because the updates have little to no new content added. All they do is tweak some minor things like the colour of text in the main menu or the player's movement speed. Honestly this is something you'd see in a small patch after the game is released.The game feels empty, flat and too ""basic"". It has no replayability because of its complete emptyness. There is nothing to see, there is nothing to do and there is no hope it will change in the nearest future. Find your money a better use.Edit:It looks like I've made a mistake stating that the game is in the development for 6 years. Actually according to this[crowdsourcecapital.blogspot.ru] article the game is being developed for 11 years. Eleven. Years.			"

								The game is sound, it just needs more weapons, an actual storyline and love. Most of all is the love. Updates are rare and focus on PvP, which is the wrong focus for the game. The devs NEED to focus on Co-op or singleplayer missions and they NEED to do so since BEFORE all the PvP updates. PvP is good, but needs an actual playerbase to play with. The playerbase would increase with more singleplayer/co-op gameplay centered updates.Nonetheless, I would highly recommend this game. It is beautiful and only lacking in weapon diversity, actual storyline and TLC.			"

								All but the most devoted fans have left, the money is drying up, and the development team is falling apart. The only hope is for an interested publisher to fund it. Can't reccomened this to anyone except for gamblers because the odds of this game being completed is 1:100. The WhyInterstellar Marines got people excited with its idea of a sci-fi tactical shooter with scary co-op using Landsharks. Unforunately development cycle priorities were unplanned and screwed up from the beginning.The HowMost of the developmental efforts were focused on PvP matches, or what could best be described as a well made counter-strike mod with three guns. At some point a co-op effort was made, but it was poorly directed. Forgettable rogue robot AI's were implemented with lame-duck go here and stand there objectives. ZPS was too afraid of a buggy co-op Landshark release, so they avoided the issue altogether by making a different game. With robots and PvP matches. "

 THE GOODInterstellar Marines is a very good game with multiple modes to play on. I haven't complete any missions, however I was very close on the Starcrown mission. I found the community to be pretty nice in the fact that they give nice tips. The game's servers are empty but there are usually 2-5 full/ partly full of players.+ guns are good+ missions+ controls+ community+ no game breaking crashing THE BADThe flashlights don't seem to work for me, and i can't see in some of the mission during the night times and pitch black stations. I also found that some of the maps are spawn killer haven. This isn't really a bad point, but i hope they add capture the flag, team death match, and king of the hill. I would also like a game mode where its the bots verus 8-16 players. - flashlight doesn't work (for me) - more game modes- more missions-a campaign for single player? "

								Co-op just got released and holy sh*t please buy this game. It is the most intense terrfying multiplayer I have ever played in my life. I got online with a buddy and these robots stalk you, flank, change postions and do everything in their power to kill you. They also weren't designed to be terrifying yet they somehow are. They look human enough for someone to feel comfortable around them but the lack of facial features and the fact that they sprint full tilt at you when they notice you makes them horrifying. It is definitely rough around the edges as its a work in progress and if you have been worried about the long development time these people know what they are doing the shooting feels great, the design is amazing (fantastic lighting, weather effects, AI is almost perfect and the guns feel powerful) and these guys know how to make a games tense. No music just ambiance, enemies are almost always heard before they are seen, you never know if the robots or moving or its just your partners footsteps. This game is just amazing and they are planning to have SHARKS WITH MUSCULAR LEGS and tons of other crazy enemies and 27 weapons. BUY IT PLEASE			"

Its sad that its losing attention and hype because we all want the experience it promises. I think if it gets more funding and they focus on the singleplayer coop part of the game it would be in a better place. Toss out pvp bring in it later. Focusing on balancing and fixing pvp is a waste of time and resources. Game feels empty and needs to bring its original player base back.			"

								Don't skip my review just because of the low playtime, I have played this excessively offline and on a friend's pc when I didn't have it :PI don't usually write reviews for games, but when I do, it is usally because of the impact this has had on my life. My first Steam Card was $10, which I used to buy Garry's Mod (newer gamers would understand).When I saw this game 2 to 3 years ago, my jaw dropped.The graphics look amazing, the gameplay looked fun and it wasn't something I would play (as I didn't have much money anyways). I started to save up for it, coin after coin, stacking up on my bookshelf, eagerly waiting till the day I could pack those cents into an envelope to my friendly neighbourhood Steam Card dealer. When I got it, it exeeded my expectations by worlds. It was a new world to me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Fast forward 3 years, and after I have played many new games and saved lots more money, I still have this game in my Favourites in my Library. I wanted to check out if there was more progress and was apalled at the sign saying 'Mixed' reviews. Why?! I asked myself. I started to scroll through the reviews and almost all of them were: ""its not finished"", or ""no updates, still buggy""I say to you, did you read that this is EARLY access? It means it is still being worked on. When I saw that there is only one developer left working soo hard on this, my heart really cries out to him. And if you people are so mad, just think about it. It's a $10 game. GAME. Someone is trying extremely hard to make it fun for you, and you complain that he is slow. 1 person. I really recommend this game, and shout out to the developer, thank you for your hard work.To those of you reading this, the developer's motto is FTLOTG. It stands for 'for the love of the game'. I think this really shows where the developer's heart is.Thanks for reading, and think to yourself before you stain this game's reputation even further by posting a negative review without really thinking.-CrimsonPythonP.S, to the dev, I think you should put this as a free weekend to increase publicity!

The game is a pretty basic and arcady multiplayer shooter with some bland single player/COOP levels with the same robot AI as before.Conclusion: Sadly this slow development and update cycle seems to be locked down a road of making a very average multiplayer shooter. The COOP elements that have been added feel very hastily cobbled together to fufil the promises made by the devs. The enemies are very bland androids and it squanders the occasional atmospheric moments generated with dark space ship interiors through lazy design.I don't think I'm going to bother with my next bi-annual 10 minute check, judging by the last 3-4 updates the devs are only now interested in slowly working on very minor cosmetic updates to menus and the multiplayer.Avoid this, its just a tease at a promise of something good and unless another dev team or publisher step in, it will never be anymore.

								Time goes by, interstellar war stays the same. That is - a bunch of grey halls with grey buildings and occasional light sources, filled by a bunch of grey people in grey suits of armor wielding grey guns. At night.I first bought the game when it was nothing but a single boot camp map with lighting and weather effects that you could toggle. Two years later it's mostly that but the lights and weather are out of your control - it's always night and occasionally it rains. There's a multiplayer component, but it's all ""basic boot camp"" styled with everyone wearing the same armor (that does not protect you) and using the same three guns which are neither precise nor different from each other.And as a whole the game feels deliberately clunky. Your helmet's faceplate is literally stained with grease and fingerprints and whites out shen shone directly upon. You can lift it, but you lose the HUD (it's admirably realistic, but what the actual joy). Your soldier runs out of breath BY WALKING. Walk for 30 seconds (or run for 10) and there you go - exhausted, can't aim at all. As for audio - extremely loud footsteps and actual tinnitus. It's a very realistic fat dude with a toy gun simulator, for all it's worth.I would have recommended it over a year ago when it had actual promise. But now... Not really.

Early Access Review
								""When is the next update?""""Next update.""~ ZPS.Bozar (the community manager) answering my question.Alright, now for an actually correct review.This game first of all is in Early access, as you may have noticed already. Surely some of you might think ""Oh great, it's another one of those sh*tty games where people are only begging for money, instant downvote."" okay, no, it's not as bad as it sounds, in fact, the game is quite decent even though it's a Unity engine based game, and I don't blame them for using such an engine, knowing how they got bankrupt a few years back. So far I will only say the game is in decent condition, not that many gamebreaking bugs, some neat coop and gameplay experience, and it's filled with good people (except for me, I am the biggest ♥♥♥♥ of the game... probably), the community is mostly lively, and one of the devs (A.K.A. ZPS.Bozar (the community manager)) make Monday and Tuesday (possibly Wednesday even) community gatherings to keep the community updated with what's going on, what are the plans, when will be the next update coughnextupdatecough, and some off topic randomness with a couple of good laughs and shooting eachother in the faces, because hey, that's what the game is about.Speaking of updates, yes, this game gets updated monthly as soon as possible, while almost 95% of the updates do get delayed due to some bugs and glitches that seem to pose a threat on what the gameplay might end up like (stuff like missing keycard spawns in which they don't spawn at all, waypoint breaks, AI errors, falling through stuff and so forth), personally, even though the devs do put up annoying delays which just make us wait a few additional weeks for a hyped update to come out... and thus likely crash a train labled ""Hype train"" full of innocent people who are only looking to see what the game has to offer. But still, the devs always do it for a good cause, they want to make the game as solid and stable as possible, whilst also give a few balancing tweaks to make sure that no one is overpowered in any way, so that's always an up. And besides, all the scripting and modelling and animating and map making is not as easy as it sounds for a small dev team, really.But now, onto the fun stuff: The gameplay.The gameplay is pretty solid, you are brought in with so far two guns (an SMG and an assault rifle, more are on the way, so give it a wait), at 7 PvP maps, all with a constant changing enviroment and increasingly good atmosphere, which will always keep you on your toes. Several singleplayer maps which can be played in coop on certain servers (more on that later on), and right now, a gamemode called Deadlock (before it was Deathmatches and Team Dominations, though these will also be brought back soon enough in the later update). Personally I like the Deadlock gamemode, it's an onslaught of an 8v8 (if you're lucky to get in a full server) where the two teams have to either capture all of the 7 points or eliminate the entire enemy opposition before they lose all the zones or get mauled by the enemy force. It's like Insurgency with Skirmish, capture a point to get your team back, although in this case, it respawns only one but (hopefully) useful teammate which has died before, which is always a good thing to do, because having the enemy outnumbered is a always an up for your team, although, just because they have only one last marine standing (or LMS for short, that, or ""That guy who is gonna die and fail our squad because he has no idea what he's doing."") can always, and I mean ALWAYS, make a turn to the game where in the end it's YOUR team that gets outnumbered, and guess what, it wasn't because your team sucks, it's because the enemy team knows where to go first, where last, where the enemy might be, what point to cap, where to camp, and so forth, it's all basically tactics that bring this up, and that's the best part, there is always a way for something to go right or painfully and horribly wrong, and the game can easily be twisted by a single person's actions, wether was it a point capture or an enemy neutralization... or just smart corner camping, HELL, ANYTHING GOES BASICALLY. But mainly, it's the teamwork that keeps the team rolling, covering certain areas to prevent flanking, reviving dead teammates next to you (did I tell you that there is actually reviving in the game? Well, I tell you now, there is reviving in the game, use it dammit) to keep the odds against the enemy, and usually an accurate aim and some good reflexes will be able to get you out of the frying pan (and possibly into the fire if you're unlucky enough...), even though some people say it feels a bit like CoD coughgodieinafirecough and a bit like quake, well, I might have to agree there a bit, it does have a slight feeling to it, but never too much, as one going CoD style against the enemy will have him killed and his team to utter failiure (never underestimate the enemy, they can always appear smarter than they look). As for the AI of the game... weellllll... let's just say they still have a lot to improve with their robots, since they're buggy as hell (running into walls, shooting at people's feet, staring at the sky for no apparent reason, did I mention running into walls?), but nonetheless always fun to play against on harder difficulties (Realistic is the highest difficulty, just so you know, and I recommend that difficutly to be palyed at all games and times), beacuse it will always give you more of a reason to use cover and move around slower, because a few shots means death. So yeah. Speaking of dying, headshots are always instakills, so keep your head somewhere safe at all times... no, not underneath a bucket you baka. In the new update they introduced a stamina and accuracy system, which will obvously affect how you aim and such, so don't run around too much or you'll be hitting everything but your target, plus, you'll be moving with the speed of a snail if you drain out completely, you have been warned.But what are the singleplayer/coop games like?Well, so far there are 2 campaign mission, The Neurogen incident and Starcrown aerospace, which are both pretty good, even though Neurogen is a little bigger and darker, which is always good, while Starcrown is basically ""Take that keycard to open that door so you can get a keycard to open that door so you can then pick up the intel thingy that looks like a keycard so you can open the evac zone and spawn tons of annoying robots which will blow your head off in a split of a second."" ... That could've been better said, but sadly, I am being honest here. The Starcrown map is basically taking keycards to open doors like all the time... Still it does give the option to go through several enterances (Front door (my favorite), a side enterance at the left (which somehow looks more like a lobby...), a giant hangar door at the back, and a very convenient fence opening on the left storage area) which does give a little more variety to what ways you want to do this, always an up, even though in the end you end up Rambo-ing out to the evac zones with your friends, nevertheless a good laugh of constantly getting shot at. There are also several other coop maps, 2 Elimination maps (Mainline and Stronghold) in which you have to kill all the robots to win, 2 Survival maps (Colony and Operations) where you have to turn the power back on (CONTRADICTION + SPOILER ALERT: You actually end up turning the power off, not on, if you get the idea), and avoid getting killed by all the robots, and lastly an Escape map, in which you gotta get topside by doing some simple objectives.Welp, looks like I'm running out of space to type stuff, so I'm just gonna conclude this with a ""Must have!"". I would've typed in so much more if I had space, sadly, Steam hates me. :CBuy this game, buy the spearhead edition, support the devs, and I get a cookie. C:			"

								The team behind this game has great passion and great ideas for this game, but they lack the funds or the manpower to follow through with this project. I am sorry to give them a negative review but this game honestly just isn't worth it at this point. The community is dead with only one or two servers actually having players on them, and the gameplay gets a bit boring after a bit.Stay far away from this sinking ship.			"

								I simply cannot recommend this game at present. The concept is good, but it seems the developers take forever to release updates and the game is still missing some extremely important mechanics to make it worthwhile. While the graphics and sound are fairly good there is not really much else to say in favour of the game at present.- You cannot create your own servers. You are limited to a handful that the devs provide which are map/gametype locked. Their ""reason"" for not releasing the server-side files is that they are scared people are going to reverse engineer it. Utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.- Only 2 weapons that are very similar. Infinite ammo, no pickups in the game world.- Enemy AI is sub-par at best and laughable at worst.- Only 2 co-op missions (at the time of this review) - so not a lot of content if you buy the game for co-op instead of PvP or Player vs Bot.- Some of the level design is wonderful, others may very well drive you to the brink of insanity due to poorly communicated objectives, a broken waypoint system and some truly atrocious level design.- The tutorial doesn't even work. You get stuck at a door and cannot continue.All-in-all, it's very lackluster. The sad thing is, they have the foundations for a great game here, but with devs that are taking forever and ignoring some massive features, I say pass on this one for now.Jimbo Rating: 4/10			"

								Calling the dev cycle on this game ""way too slow"" is an insult to dev cycles and things that move too slowly. There has essentially been no significant movement on this project for years, and yet I still occasionally receive email updates about its development.There are the beginnings of a good game, perhaps even a great one, here. But those beginnings have been in effectively the same state for many years.			"

Early Access Review
								This review is coming from someone that followed the kickstarter of this game, and was incredibly excited to see it on steam.The moment the game came out on steam I bought it. My expectations were low, seeing as it was early access, and I was unsuprised at how little content there was. When I first saw the game, and when I bought it, I was hooked on how strongly they advertised an emmersive coop experience. The space sharks, the atmosphere, the whole thing looked like the coop shooter kind of experience I'd been looking for in other games, with a PvP gamemode tacked on for fun.Updates were slow, but I tolderated it. Small team, small funding, right?Updates continued to crawl along, with more content than ever. So why am I not recommending the game?Well the devs seem to have forgoten what they advertised the meat of this game being: a coop game. They continually realise PvP maps, PvP gamemodes, and other PvP specific features. There are currently two Coop maps. Both are a lot of fun, they both feel incredibly lacking in parts, but still fun.However, theres been two maps for almost half a year now. Maybe if they add  actual  coop features, I'll change my review, but as of now I'm incredibly dissapointed.Don't buy this game unless youre a fan of dissapointment.			"

								Bought this game a little over 3 years ago, really liked the ideas and aesthetic of the game, Co-op survival story mode, Terrifying land sharks and claustrophobic combat.I played some good matches on multi player, very intense and nerve shredding, but the overall package was pretty barren, so figured i would come back to it after more development time. Since i have checked back from time to time over the years hoping for some progress on the initial goals to no avail, No story, no land sharks, hardly anyone on the servers, it's dead. I feel bad for the guys that paid for the spearhead edition, they are never going to see the future content they paid for if the base game hardly exists. Too much time was spent meandering with minor mp updates and engine conversions till they had probably burned through all their cash and then lost their staff.Another example of the darkside of early access games, poorly planned and unable to meet any of its major goals / selling points.

								Interstellar Marines is very polished, the gameplay is fun, controls are tight. However the devs seem more preoccupied with developping the pvp aspect of the game, despite adventising itself as an ""old school, co op, roleplaying, non linear gameplay"" game, it seems to have forgotten that entirely and the past updates have been PVP orientated. I personally think that this game has tremedous potential (hence the positive rating), but to reach that potential the devs have to realize that not a lot of people are interested in another deathmatch first person shooter. They need to develop the co op side of things since thats there the true potential is.			"

								I honestly believe this game has a lot of potential, and I like the interface and how they really focused on the tiny details (in particular I love the helmet effects). But, if I was to be honest, I wouldn't recommend this to my friends. Its been in developement for too long, and at some point you have to face facts. The developers are adding to the details of the game, but the overall game... just isn't there. Games like Insurgency, ARMA, Battlefield, (and hell even COD) get the focus of their games right. This game has no real focus. Its been in developement too long, and I just don't see it going down a path where its going to turn into the game that I think everyone hoped it would be all of a sudden.			"

 Awesome game with a bright future ahead of it    I have been following this game since it launched its kick starter, and i can clearly say this is one of the only games out there that dont do it for the money, the do it because they want to make the game they have alklways wanted and they need our help to fund it. Had it since the first days it was released and the game itself is growing quite quick for the time its been on steam. The bots in this game are very responsive and realistic, the player HUD is imersive and the only two weapons feel great. For now it has two coop missions with some lore and a few more that are just challenges, and it also contains some team pvp. This is my first real review so it might be pretty bad but all i want to say is that I have extremely high hopes for this amazing game.			"

I was really interested in the story and couldn't wait to play through the campaign. It seems now it has shifted its focus to multiplayer. I'm not caught up on the recent news but i'm seeing that the funds are drying up which is a real shame.

This game is pitch black in most of its single player modes, so without your torch, you can't see anything. And that torch attracts attention (well it really doesn't seem to make a lot of difference but it's nice to pretend).Slowly improving since it began a few years back, this game has turned out pretty solid, but still has a long way to go.

Written on 08/08/2015I previously wrote a lengthy review as to why I wouldn't recommend this game any more (I had a Recommended review up before that which I didn't take down for a good while after I couldn't really recommend it any more), except Steam didn't want me to post it even after hacking massive chunks out of it to make it under the supposed character limit for Steam reviews that I found mentioned somewhere after googling it (many people write reviews over that count so it can't be right) and planning to paste those sections in the comments. I didn't feel I could remove any more and still have the main points in the actual review and covered well enough to say most of what I wanted to say, so I decided to leave it for the time being. I might upload it elsewhere and link it here at some point.In essence, I'd stated that while I wouldn't recommend it any more for multiple reasons, it was still a game people could potentially enjoy at least for a while before coming to the same conclusion as me and no longer enjoying / recommending it, and also a game that people could possibly be happy with from purchase up until it's completion (if it's completed). They focus too much on adding things and too little on keeping what they already have in a playable / enjoyable state. Too much on drawing people in with additions to make it look like they're making progress and too little on fixing the ever increasing number of bugs and making sure those additions are in a good enough state to feel like they add to the game, rather than detract from enjoyment. Too much on drawing in new players and too little on retaining those they already have.Now I feel I would not recommend it in the slightest, not even to those who look at the store page and recent gameplay and think “this looks like my sort of game!” because I don't know what the heck the devs are doing but I don't care for it.I have the following to keep things short (at least in this review..), however, to see some of my reasons for not recommending this game there'll be a fair bit of reading involved, and I can't guarantee that by the time you check these links out the threads won't be deleted. Just know that despite my hours I would most definitely no longer recommend this game.http://steamcommunity.com/app/236370/discussions/0/541907867777620602/The two previous (now locked) threads:http://steamcommunity.com/app/236370/discussions/0/541907867768186035/ - The original and first to be locked.http://steamcommunity.com/app/236370/discussions/0/541907867769392545/ - The second and second to be locked.http://imgur.com/PaBEvnL The community manager handed over the discussion moderation to the other community manager.

Early Access Review
								Interstellar Marines has been one of the most entertaining games I have played, despite the fact that I am not a huge fan of the FPS genre. Zero Point Software's vision of creating a Sci-Fi tactical shooter is incredibly impressive, as is their work on the game so far. The game is highly detailed, incredibly immersive (in fact, it can be quite terrifying at times for that very reason,) and its multiplayer experience is actually pretty good as well. In order for your team to succeed in PvP, for example, you must work with your team to be successful; trying to be a hero and throwing yourself in the middle of dense firefights invariably gets you killed, and denies your team an otherwise valuable asset. Co-op is also quite interesting as well, and provides a formidable challenge in its own right. Playing the game on your own is not quite as enjoyable as playing with others, but do bear in mind this game is meant to be a multiplayer experience, rather than a campaign-based shooter.Interstellar Marines, in my opinion, is an excellent game as it is. It does, however, suffer from a nagging problem that many early access games suffer today -- it has been, and still is, largely in its infancy after many years of development. The ZPS team is small and incredibly limited -- anyone who has been paying attention to their development knows this. It is for this reason I urge people to cut this team some slack. However, I also believe the way ZPS went about marketing this game was not smart. If I could give a piece of advice to ZPS, and I say this as a hobbyist developer, it is this:Do not publish your game on Steam, even on early access, until you have achieved your game's primary goals. If this means keeping it off Steam for three years, so be it. You'll be able to focus on building your game as opposed to (expending resources better spent making a finished product) supporting an active community. Furthermore, Zero Point Software has lost hundreds, potentially thousands, of players over the years as people lost interest in a title they would otherwise be enjoying if it had been released as a finished product. By publishing this game to Steam before it was complete, Zero Point Software lost a large chunk of supporters.Am I suggesting taking IM off the shelf until it is complete? No. It is far too late to take IM off Steam, as it would upset the few people still enjoying the game. If this game were finished before being put on Steam, I have no doubt it would be at least half as much a hit as TF2 for a good while.So, do I suggest purchasing this game? No. HOWEVER, if you appreciate the ZPS team's work and wish to see development continue, I highly recommend supporting these developers as they persue their goal of completing this game. Make donations, and to those who already own the game, please provide plenty of feedback. They have put a lot of effort into making what you see before you, and it would be a heartbreak to see this opportunity wasted. I hope it's not too late for this game to see a resurgence.			"

Early Access Review
								As of writing this, I have logged a good 217 hours into the game according to Steam.Update: 680 hours now.Since this game is in early access, the information written here is subject to change. Right now, I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun game to play with your friends or even random people online using the ingame VOIP.Stuff the game has:Enemies - Robots, Real People (in multiplayer), TR-100's (they are all your enemy)Guns - SMG, Assault Rifle with 3x scopeSingleplayer/Coop - Neurogen Incident, Nucleus Escape Mission, Operations (Swarm mode)Multiplayer - 5 or 6 maps with day/night cycles that happen while matches are happeningIt has a HUD which can be disabled if you get shot but don't die. It will regenerate if you don't get shot for a little while longer.A ranking system which basically quantifies how experienced of a player you are. Your Training Rank goes up the more Training Points you have. The first ten levels are easy to get, and so are the next twenty or thirty. After that you notice it takes a little longer to level up. It takes 1000 TP to get to TR-10. It takes 100,000 TP to get to TR-90, then 200,000 TP to acheive TR-100.So that's basically what it has. I glossed over a few things, for example, the maps. Some of the maps are dynamic, changing midway through the level, altering slightly how the game is played on that map (map name: Elevation, Colony).SHAMELESS PLUG - Youtube channel:  N00bvlog (n00bvlog) Now, back to your programmed content.The Neurogen Incident is a huge coop map which could potentially be very creepy for you to play. You could play by yourself, but I would recommed playing coop because there are no checkpoints and if you die, you die, which could be very frusterating if you play for a long time and then lose all your progress. In coop, your team mates have the opportunity to revive fallen teammates during a span of 15 seconds before their team mate is gone for good. The map is huge and has some performance issues (which, I'm sure, are being worked on).There are also some smaller missions which do not suffer from a performance hit quite as much.There's a new gamemode called Hell Week. It is pretty fun when there are people to play it with. The gist of this mode is this: it goes up to 64 players who gather Combat Points throughout the game. You can get these points by either opening loot crates scattered around each of the 9 maps, killing players and picking up their points in a dropped backpack, or going for high risk, high reward supply drops. There are 9 aforementioned maps of differing themes: winter, jungle, moon, canyon... etc. Eventually a countdown timer starts and, after 2 minutes, the player with the lowest score gets eliminated from the game. The last 4 players to be alive have ""survived the Hell Week"" and have won the game.There are 2 versions of the game mode. The first is basically called Hardcore Hell Week. If you die, you're dead. You can't get back into the game and have to wait 4 hours for another 'week' to start. This makes playing the game EXTREMELY intense. In the early iterations of HW, there was no team support. Once I tried to team up with a guy on VOIP. We spent a long time looking for each other. All of a sudden, he told me to jump. I jumped. He noticed me before I did and needed to quickly check to make sure it was me.Now that we had successfully teamed up, I got him to guard me while I hid in a bush so I could go AFK and pee.It was super intense. Unfortunately, because people were frusterated at having to wait extended periods of time between Hell Weeks, ZPS made another version of HW that is the one we, for the most part, play today. In this newer version, you can respawn after you die. It doesn't become hardcore until about 30 minutes passes by. ZPS also implemented teams so you can team up with up to 3 other people and share your points across all team members. This makes die-ing less frusterating, but it also takes away the tense-ness of the gamemode for me.Performance-wise, this game does not perform the greatest on my machine I seem to always get 30 FPS (a range of 15 - 45). Here are my specs so you can judge whether this is good or bad. Intel Duo core CPU running @ 3 GHz. RAM: 4GB, Graphics Card: Nvidia GTX 670.As far as I know, the update schedule of the game is about 1 update per month.EDIT: due to the game selling poorly, there are fewer people working on the game. I estimate updates will take much longer than 1 per month now.So, this game is coming along quite fine, and, with each update it is becoming more and more the game I want it to be (such is the nature of Early Access). Obviously it is not there yet, so if you want a full game that runs great, don't buy the game yet. Read another review in about a year or so. It should have many more features and potentially be optimized by then.Update: The game might come out before Half Life 3. Development has slowed. Even so, I still recommend it.Hope this helps. "

Early Access Review
								The dedication ZPSHicks has put into this dream of his... err... this dream of ours... is beyond incredible to me.The release of UPDATE 26 has revived the singleplayer missions for me.  The lower difficulties limit respawns, or ""lives"" as they're called.  This introduction makes the difficulty levels more distinguishable and accurate in regards to their titles.  As for Wargames, it received life-replenishing updates, & much-needed bug-squashing.If you are contemplating whether or not you should give Interstellar Marines a chance despite the many reviews which claim that updates are released at the speed of a turtle; I want you to know, I contemplated it too! I don't regret my decision even a little =)! Remember; You can request a refund if you decide Interstellar Marines isn't for you within 2 hours of gameplay. "

Early Access Review
								You can't just buy this game while it is EARLY ACCESS, and then complain about bugs, insulting and without giving any constructive opinion. That really doesn't help the developers. Probably because of the same people with disgusting attitude many games were abandoned. This is really really beta, you have only a weapon, so you can understand how beta this is.First of all, i didn't spend much time in the game to be honest, but i can give you my opinion so far, i really think it can be helpful.I didn't encounter any glitches like i don't know, falling through the map, so far. The game is well optimised but sometimes i get random FPS drops, but not very often.What can be improved:I love the shadows and the lighting, but i think you can work a little bit more on the shadows because sometimes you can confuse them with an enemy (or it might just be me).You could also improve the running, it feels more like sliding. (some more work on the walking wouldn't be bad either)The shooting mechanism, it doesn't feel very exciting or real.I love how weather changes and it starts raining, it is awesome, but since you have a helmet with some sort of face-protection i think the rain drops should slide, not just stick there.Chat system, currently, honestly it is awful, i am pretty sure nobody likes to open a window to see the new messages from other players.Accuracy, for some reason it is kinda weird, it happened to me to shoot an entire clip into someone and ending up by getting killed (even if i burstly shot).So far, i am impressed with this game, at this stage of the game, i honestly expected to see through walls, fall through the map, getting stuck inside the floor, maybe application not responding. So far, you really did a good job. And don't let this game go because of idiotic people who just rant about it without giving a constructive opinion, just because they couldn't read 'Early Access'. This game can become huge! It has potential more than probably 40% of the AAA shooters. "

Its been 4 years since its release and it's not even half-way finished with what the devs promised. There is no community, there is no multiplayer, there is no hope.

Early Access Review
								This is a game with a lot of potential. When I first got it back on March 2015, it promised a unique FPS experience. The maps are very interesting and even after 230 hours of gameplay I still find myself discovering new approaches. The community is competitive, relatively small and friendly which was part of what made the game entertaining. However at it's current state where the devs choose to ignore people's frequent problems, I wouldn't recommend anyone spending money on this. The development process is very, VERY slow and I've been experiencing frequent crashing for the past 2-3 months which ruins the whole experience (and the current match most of the time). Rather than dealing with the more serious problem, the devs are simply adding skins to the game. Needless to say, the direction this game has taken is what makes me not recommend it.			"

								Interstellar Marines is one of the first early access games I have played so I did not really know what to expect. So far I have played for five hours and I must say I have really enjoyed it. Sure its a unfinished product player movement is a bit stiff but there is really nothing bad I can say about this game. Rounds in matches can be very fast or take a while which is intense at times the outcome of a match can change in seconds.The environment playes a big part of the game also suddenly there will be a power failure and its pitch black which makes you change up your game plan. I would definitely recommend this game as I can only see it getting better as time progresses even as a early access game I feel like its a solid product.			"

								Well after some help from fellow players I am safely able to change my review to Highly Recommended. The promise in this game is amazing and I believe this deserves many more people to recognise it. Because I'm lazy however I'll head straight to Pros and ConsPros:  - Amazing Atmosphere. especially in gamemodes such as Elimination, The game combines slight horror with a tactical shooting experience the likes of which I haven't seen before. In most games, putting a powerful weapon into the hands of the protagonist will help ease the ""Spook Level"", In this game it doesn't. Especially with the volume turned up high, hearing a robots fast running footsteps getting closer and closer behind you is INCREDIBLY nerver racking and I love it - Shooting mechanics work very well, this game isn't another Spray'n'Pray FPS Shooter. It has a very balanced shooting system with amazing hitbox accuracy. It forces you to focus on your targets and make sure your bullets land, because if they dont you may just find yourself full of them. - Tacticality, the game makes you think about your actions. Going around a corner in the dark may only be a good idea 70% of the time, this game creates that decision of whether or not to turn your flashlight on. Need to go through a door? As soon as its open everything near you knows where you are so be ready. - Amazing FPS. As long as you don't have the bug (which can be easily fixed yourself) where the game will use integrated graphics instead of your graphics card, the game runs very smoothelyCons: - Multiple bugs, especially ones that have occured since the latest patch. However because this is early access this is to be expected - The devs don't update very often (or so I have heard). I feel like constant bug fixes are necessary for an early access game like this so I hope this improves - No option to host your own server to play with friends. You either play solo or join one of the servers availableOverall the game is very solid, it has a lot of potential and is already a very enjoyable game with friends or without them. However I haven't found a way to host a server yet, but if it is possible please tell me it would be greatly appreciated.			"

								Early Access as hell, but what's here is enjoyable and has a lot of promise. Unlike some other Early Access games, Interstellar Marines has also been building on that promise, rather than tripping over itself constantly. It's got the best HUD in ages (A visor that actually reacts to the game world, with rain drops dripping down it, and damage eventually causing it to malfunction and no longer display friend or foe indicators. Hell, you can even open and close the visor if you want.), intense gunplay that Rainbow Six fans will instantly love, and, well, that's kind of it for now.As much fun as being paranoid, scanning around dark rooms, flipping your flashlight on for a second before turning it off again so you don't give yourself away can be, it's not going to keep you coming back for more time and time again when all that is here is a few maps, a few modes, and two guns. A complete lack of the main focus, co-op play, is also rather jarring.Still, if you need a Rainbow Six fix, this is already one of the best choices you can make. And while the updates aren't frequent, they've been consistently high quality. IM is a game to keep an eye on, if nothing else.			"

								The basic problem with most of the negative reviews is almost all include very little playtime.This game gets better and better the more you play. It is not like Counter Strike but both games share this.The charging bots will sometimes scare the crap out of you. Sometimes they seem to come from nowhere. The sounds of them moving are also VERY eerie. It reminds me of hearing the face huggers slither around in one of the earlier Alien games. Occasionally you will hear someone whispering, “Help me”. Eek. Overall, the atmosphere of this game is wonderful.The game includes many types of gameplay even though it is early assess. Personally, I like the ones that are coop against AI.The game is tactical. If you wander off on your own, you will likely soon die.Being early access, the game is clearly not finished. The basic game does play well and is a blast in its current state. That said, there are issues. The game is not optimized well yet so lag can sometimes be an issue. There are not many on the servers but I have found if I join an empty one, others join. You can also play single-player but this game is not easy on your own.The Dev’s have a lot to get done before they can call this complete and they are a small group. I like buying this type of game in early access as it is a lot of fun when patches are released. For being early access, the game is a blast and I would highly recommend it if you like tactical shooters, especially coop ones. "

								There are already plenty of reviews out there talking about the game itself. Some would argue for a review that is all that matters. However for an Early Access title that has been in development for who knows how long, the developers are also on equal grounds to be judged. Perhaps things will get better in time, but as of right now Zero Point Software is not a developer I will support any longer. The way they have treated this community lately has been nothing but disgraceful and disrespectful. The video they released is thankfully being taken down, but that will never fix any issues regarding their treatment of the community. Here is a link to a thread from Reddit, which explains everything. I will also link the third thread regarding the subject that was created by me, since the other two threads were locked. http://imgur.com/gallery/cbR1Rhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/236370/discussions/0/541907867777620602/ZPS's treatment of the community has been nothing but locking threads, making constant threats, permantley banning users, and not even hinting that they are taking anything I or any other member have put forward regarding not only the video but the treatment of their paying customers. They clearly don't care about feedback, and they clearly don't have the foresight or basic common sense to think about their actions before they make them. I tried to be as civil and respectful as possible, and they have yet to answer the points and reasoning I put forth explaining why members were upset, and why the video was not a good idea to begin with. I will never get a response, and it is also clear they could care less. Until this developer proves it can be mature and understanding, you should not entrust them with completing a game such as this. The image for Interstellar Marines was a beautiful one, and after all these years they have barely anything to show for it, aside from their harrassment of customers who bought their game out of support and trust. They have lost my support and have broken everyone's trust. Maybe when they begin to take some responsibility for their actions there could be hope, but I am doubtful and will no longer try to provide feedback. They had their chance to prove themselves apart from the usual EA dev. They failed not only themselves, but their community. As such I can not recommend the game for the shape it's currently in, or the prospect that it will ever be what it could have been.			"

Early Access Review
								I've only played this game for 6 hours as of now, but I've gotten to rank 25 online, which isn't too bad considering 80% of people who're on there are all under rank 8.  PROS  Gameplay The gameplay is surprisily very good. Realistic, and yet not too hard.  The guns will move a bit upwards if you hold the trigger, but is still controllable, and confortable, so it's not bad. Just like other good FPS games like Battlefield(s), Medal of Honor, etc. The scope on your assault rifle is 4x zoom, but only has 20, contrary to your main weapon, which is a SMG, and holds 30. Nevertheless, the assault rifle packs a big punch, and if used right, can prove useful as a sniper would. Very accurate and easy to use. The SMG however, is all a SMG is really; quick firing, red dot scope, light, 30 round clip. Overall I like them both for what they are; one is close range, the other long range.  Maps So I haven't done very many of the single player missons yet, but I've played all the online maps that there are, which is 9. All of them are fun in their own way. The winter one is very *cough*cool*cough*, the swamp map is a nightmere in the dark, but still freakily fun, and the others are well-made with lots of spots to hide behide, and lots of spots to round a corner and get shot in the face, or walk up to a building in the dark only to find out a guy is in the shadows *dead*. Overall, they're great maps in a sci-fi setting. You won't get bored of them very quickly.  Gadgets The laser on the guns is awesome. You can see the point of it no matter where it is shining. (in the tree, on the ground, or 4 miles away) The only con about it is, in most maps whether in the dark, or rain, snow, etc, you can see the whole beam of light. Which makes it very easy to find the man holding the gun. The flashlight is very bright, but gives you away in a *cough*flash*cough*. You have to pick the right moments to turn it on. if you're in a big room, and you think you saw someone, it's totally worth turning it on to get a kill. or at least see where you are in the pitch-black moments. The silencer works, and I haven't noticed any reduced velocity as of yet. You have unlimited ammo. Keep reloading till your R button is broken. I litterally reload even if I only used two bullets. A good habit to have.Overall the gadgets have their advantages and disadvantages. Once you start playing you figue out what works best for you. CONS   Guns Although the two guns they give you by default are amazing, they do get old after awhile. And so far the game only has the two. I'm sure the devlopers will add more as they continue to add things to the game, but for now you'll have to live with the only two.  Team Killing  Oh yes, everyone's worst nightmere! Well, unlike other games that don't have team tags above players, this one does. The problem is once you get shot to a degree, your whole hub in your face screen shuts down for about 10 - 15 seconds.  In that time the person who shot you could be right outside the doorway, but the only way you can tell if it's him or your teammate is if you see a little blue on him, (which is hard to see anyways) as the friendly tags and all the digital things you see in the game are gone. (except your sites on the guns)  So yeah, there is a fair share of team killing, but it also makes it interesting for yourself when you get shoot.  Respawning Yes, when you die in an online match, (not co-op, I don't know what it's like for co-op) it takes about 100 - 120 seconds to respawn in a ten minute game. And you only have 15 seconds to be revived, which isn't very much at all, seeing is how you have to be careful in this game. But, if a teammate gets a kill, then a person get's to respawn early. or if someone captures a flag. So believe me when I say it's a team oriented game online. Overall I rate it 7/10. You will have lots of fun with it, and at the sametime get scared outta your pants in moments. And it's not finished, so get it now while it's on sale, because it's great deal.-------EDIT------- This is my first edit since a few weeks after I bought the game last February. Alot of things have changed. Hellweek was intreduced, then bots (CTR's) to hellweek. They added the pistol for the purpose of hellweek as that is your starting gun. (it's just a stripped version of the SMG just 15 round clip and semi auto with iron sites) One new map was placed into MP, and a 2nd one will be here in the next update. The weapons had a complete redo to make them more realistic. The game was upgraded to Unity 5. And alot of small things that really make a difference from a person who's played the game a ton.  The game itself is going through a hard time as of now because they're trying to implant new things but it's causing bugs while doing so. Even now they're trying to fix random game crashes that happens to just about everyone, and another bug that causing you to randomly fall through the floor. (Although that doesn't happen alot like crashes) The devs are working very hard to fix these issues, and once those get fixed, then we can see some fresh new content which  includes more co-op in the next few months. I have alot of hours, and it's because I love the PvP in this game, so much in fact that I joined a clan, and helped make that clan maybe the best clan in the game now. They're only a few clans in the game now, but that's mostly to blame because of the devlopment being slow and bugs causing fustration. Hopefully that will be fixed in the next few weeks, and Season 3 of the Phyregaming (.com for the website) league will start soon after these bugs are fixed.			"

Early Access Review
								When I bought this game, I immediately regretted it when the game was nothing more than a few multiplayer maps that you could walk around in.It has improved a large amount since then, with a co-op campaign being added. It looks like a good start to an atmospheric survival-horror game. Perhaps not quite worth the $20 at this stage since there is still very little there, but maybe in the future.7.9/10 - Pants were ♥♥♥♥.			"

								Multiplayer: prepare to rage (If you find a server with players).Co-op:  Prepare to ♥♥♥♥ bricks.  if you have thin walls in your house or are prone to heart attacks and shock, please be careful.  I'm writing this just as I experienced the first co-op test.  problem is that i did not invite any friends ;-;.  Imagine being in a completely dark, sprawling hangar complex, with nobody to keep your sanity, and god knows how many robots waiting for you.  And let's not even count the scare when you see a robot but aren't sure if it's dead.  if you think left 4 dead or a similar game is scary, you ain't seen nothing yet.  I can tell that this fear I just had will be multiplied tenfold when more enemies and missions are there.  ♥♥♥♥, if there were good procedurally generated, dynamic missions, that would be craaaaaazy awesome (and bad at the same time).  Graphics are good, UI is amazing (Very realistic near-future/space age hybrid for the HUD) and the experience is unmatched.  god knows what it would feel like to play this on an oculus rift.  In short:  if you buy this, make sure you get a 4 pack or more for some buds, because without that sort of teamwork with people you know, you'll be ♥♥♥♥ed by 10 different species of aliens and robots.

								Pros: -good weather effects -great sound design-does nights/darkness right-decent variety of mapsCon:-Co-op missions are boring -incredibly slow development -potentially vaporware -barely any content -multiplayer is mostly dead -only 3 usable weapons In all honestly I can't recommend this game since it feels like another EA scam. The game started out with one weapon, no sprint, no crouching, no jumping, multiplayer and 2-3 maps. Now a few years later we have 3 guns, sprint, crouching, jumping, a few more maps, co-op missions, AI controlled robots. I don't see it going anywhere and I don't see why anyone should invest into this game since it still is barebones and not worth the current asking price. The devs will eventually run out of money and release this as unfinished product or maybe it will be stuck in EA limbo forever.So unless the development process speeds up and they actually add something meaningful to this game I can't recommend it			"

-Recommended Title-Interstellar Marines is a good honest, great looking, grunty (great performer) early access, FPS game. Plenty of tactical elements and challenges to keep this ol boys pacermaker functioning. Graphics are fluid and clean - along with the ""I no complain"" sounds....I'm immersed immediately into the futuristic setting where I am god with a gun. Fear me.At 13.5 hours of gameplay, Im still loving the game, and no complaints. Don't tell the old sod down the local dairy (convenience store), cause, I complain at him all the time.This game does need some sort of sync tool for pacemakers, otherwise, a two thumbs up from me.Early Access Score: 9.0/10 "

Early Access Review
								There should be a limit to how long a game can sit in early access.Edit: I mostly wrote this review as a quick review to just express my opinion. This now being the top review, I feel that I should elaborate. I bought into this game very early. I'm not sure why it shows my game time as little as it does, as I played this game for proabably around ~30 hours or so. I have periodically tried this game, hoping for some significant changes to it, but it really feels like the same game it was 3-4 years ago. Sure there have been some cosmetic changes, and it is a very beautiful gtame now, but it took them over a year to even add another gun to it, making for gameplay that got stale very quickly. At this point you can still enjoy this game with a friend. The co-op definitely has some fun left in it, but there are better co-op experiences elsewhere. If this game is finally completed and has a significant single-player or co-op campaign that is worth buying, then I will update my review. Until such time I just really can't recommend a game that has felt stagnant and doesn't seem to offer much hope of improvement. One of my major issue is that I bought into this game because it claimed it was going to be a role-playing fps, it even still claims they plan to impliment this feature. I was hoping for this game to offer a new and unique fps experience, and really believed in the devs vision. But when 3 years later and these elements are nowhere to be found, the game ends up just feeling like another bland fps, and there are plenty other, finished, fps's that are worth playing over this one. There just isn't currently anything that this game offers that you can't find elsewhere save for the cool helmet mechanic (which adds nothing to gameplay).I'm not claiming the devs stole my money, or even saying it's a bad design or crap game. I simply would not recommend this game that feels stagnant, has never implemented rpg elements, and does not have enough people playing, making it difficult to find a full server nearbyI am not directly faulting the devs either. I understand that bad things happen even to good, well-meaning devs with a good vision. This game may still have hope, and could end up being amazing. But in the end, this is a review, and overall I would not recommend this game in the state that it is in. I just feel that currently I would not recommend to my friends for them to buy this game. That's my general gauge for a thumbs-up or down, would I tell my friend to buy this game? If in the future if it is finally at least close to the final vision I will absolutely update my review.

Early Access Review
								Interstellar Marines is an old school tactical FPS games in a wonderful dark SCI-FI world with a realistic combat system.It's still Early Access and a small Team's working on but since the beginning i enjoyed more than 350 hours of gameplay.You can play 2 big maps in Singleplayer or 4-Player Coop: Starcrown Aerospace (infiltrate a fortress on a planet) and the Neurogen Incident (big cargo environment and science labs in space). 3 types of Challenges: Survival, Elimination or Escape you can play alone or in Coop.And the PVP mode Deadlock with a few maps for example Dynacore, Stronghold and Evacuation where you have to take points and hold'em as team. A round end's, after your team took all points or eliminated the whole opposing team. Every week there are community gatherings for EU and US where you can play with Dev's and IM-Progamer from different clans, to have a nice talk in the chat or in teamspeak. At christmas they add a funny Terminator PVP mode where one player is totally overpowered with a special-damage weapon and armour so you have to take the T-IM101 down as team or you die several times :) And the great Wargame (Hellweek) PVP Arena within 8 completely different maps (on the moon surface, in the jungle, mountains, wetlands, industrial environment and more) where you have to fight against bots and other players, collect weapons and ammo, points and marked air drops. You can play alone or teamup with other players in wargames, but after one hour the team or the first four player with the highest points will win and the round is over ,then you have to wait a few minutes until the next wargame-arena event starts. The enemys in Interstellar Marines are two kind of robots, a runner (weapon: fist) and a gunner. But there will come more, i wait hard for the alien race: the landsharks. Your equipment: 3 different weapons: SMG, AR and a pistol all with flashlight, laser and silencer (pistol without silencer) and skins for your suit and weapons, i hope a shotgun and something like a knife will come too also more types of enemys and a few animals in the environment would be perfect for the atmosphere i guess (jumpscares). But what i really love in IM ... the atmosphere, the day/night cyclus and changing weather, exhaustion system... unique. The price is definitely worth it.If i have one word for Interstellar marines: Intense.			"

Early Access Review
								A decent indie game that, for the most part, provides excellent co-op and single player game play with a little extra multiplayer on the side that is also a great time-waster. I do recommend it only because I'd like to see this game grow & expand. Unfortunately, it's an early access game. I normally do not like early access games, especially since most of them seem to not progress any further. However, despite the extremely slow development this game has been getting, it's on a steady course to becoming a complete game somewhere down the road. I already enjoy this game as is, and imagining it in it's complete stage years from now as a tactical shooter in a realistic sci-fi future excites me.The community is fairly small and unless you've got a few friends to play with you're likely going to spend most of your time here in early access fooling around in single player fighting robots in a supposed ""training simulation"" as candidates for the Interstellar Marine program as we await the story to develop. There are two campaign missions plus two maps that host a terrorist hunt style mode, an escape mode, and a gauntlet mode of sorts. The multiplayer is what you would expect in a tactical FPS. There are some frame rate issues I've noticed.All in all, if you got some money to spend and are looking to waste some time alone or with freinds, I'd definately recommend checking this out.			"

								*This is an older review, but has been re-done up to update 12.**You should buy this game as soon as possible, it will only get more expensive!*I love it! So much potentional :) And its being made by danes (People from Denmark) which is awesome!I also really like the lighting and weather, the weather changing and dynamic lighting is really cool. You can change the weather in singleplayer itself by pressing N.In multiplayer it basically just switches automatically from day to night, sun to storm and rain throughout the match, which is a really nice touch.Also... LENS FLARES!! :D (I love lens flares...)You have a flashlight for when it gets dark, which looks nice actually, and a laser for hipfiring.*Note* - When you have either flashlight or laser turned on, you are easily spotted.You can reload while scoped-in, which is really nice.There is some basic HUD, you can see your ammo, if your flashlight/laser is turned on or off and theres a killfeed, as well as you are able to see capture points and scoreboards for each team.You have 2 different weapons, one is a close quarters SMG and the other one a long range rifle with a scope that can zoom even further, it has more damage but less bullets and fire rate than the SMG.You can jump, but its a jump you have to charge up before you can reach max height.You can toggle sprint by using Shift. (Default)You can crouch by pressing C. (Default)You can do covering fire by leaning up against an object and aiming with right-click. (Default)All in all i will give this 9/10 for being at its Update 12 state, and the last stars would be for fixing the FPS, optimizing it.Really cool game, highly recommended. Looking forward to seeing future updates.*You should buy this game as soon as possible, it will only get more expensive!*			"

SEE EDIT BELOWFor the love of the game, indeed.The Dev's at Zero-Point have done a great job with updates on this game and you can tell they really are making a game where they not only consider their own input, but their community's as well.When I first picked up the game, I enjoyed playing against others with nothing but just the basic SMG at a time when crouching (or jumping, I forget) wasn't even in the game, not to mention AI or actual co-op other than the Deadlock game mode.I stopped playing for a couple months and came back to find a second rifle, a fully functioning AI system that utilizes one of the two firearms and another type for melee, not to mention six co-op missions, eight maps each with its own dynamic weather and it's safe to say I was pretty blown away. The AI is fun to play with, especially on co-op, and with their ability to register light and sound they fully react to your every move and it doesn't help that they can be clever little robo-♥♥♥♥♥es sneaking up behind you and sprinting at you with a robotic screech which will startle you when you least expect it. The addition of suppressors for both firearms is great because this not only affects online play with players, but also the robots.So yeah, you can be a ♥♥♥♥ and send all the robots a'runnin' to you and your squad. Community is friendly, helpful, and lively enough. Go on any day of the week at pretty much any time and sure enough there will be at least a couple of servers with players in them.(Edit, 3/21/2017)Well, I bought this nearly four years ago, Jan. 1st 2014 and it's been a good run. Unfortunately Hicks seems to be left completely alone on this game and realistically there's no way it'll ever be finished. I had a great time with the game and even now I just got done playing War Games with a few people, cheers Bleed Out.For old time sake I will keep recommending it.Fun fact: this was the 23rd game on my account.

								I REALLY like this game. I love the atmosphere, the play style, the little features like the helmet visor, and the gameplay. Everytime I launch it and join a server, I have a blast. If of course, there are enough people online. So why is this review negative? I support this concept. A more tactical approach to FPS shooters is a great approach, AND it's the only Sci-Fi shooter (besides the Halo series) that I like. But here is the underlying problem at its core. This game has made little progress in recent years. At its current state, the game looks like a very early access game. Of course, the steam page supports this. However, the game has been out for a couple of years now. It has not significantly improved since the launch. Should you buy it? If you have patience. The developer is struggling to keep its footing. They haven't released any updates in months (Aug 2014). I wouldn't recommend it until more content is released. Let the developers figure out what to do before you support them. Current state 8/10 (Don't buy until the game gets out of this ""Early Access"" stage)			"

								This game is honestly a disgrace. I have owned this game since 2013. They have made little to no progress with it. The only noticeable change is the fact that they recently added a new gun. A SINGLE GUN! The game has 3 count them. 3 guns. With so much potential I'm wondering what the devs have been doing since they started working on this game. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! At this point the developers have made enough money off of this beautiful piece of crap. That is exactly what it is. It works, it's beautiful, it's interesting, but there is barely any content in it. The most fun I had with it was messing with my friend and telling him to press K to kill himself. The lack of overall effort in this game is unacceptable. The concept is awesome. The mechanics are interesting and I'd love to see them work in a full game. But at this point the game is barley finished and it has been YEARS! This game started development FAR before it was even put to the store. I want to say that it was first announced in 2006 (don't quote me on that). Until this game gets finished in 20 years don't waste your time and money.			"

								I'd love to recommend this game.  It shows much promise as a cooperative sci-fi tactical shooter.Unfortunately, the developers have seemingly directed all resources toward the game's versus modes.  While the versus isn't bad by any means, other games (Insurgency) do it better.  The last six months or so have been dedicated to a versus mode they call ""Hell Week"", that as far as I can tell, nobody asked for and the majority didn't/doesn't want.These devs had a lot of cool ideas that they have thrown to the wayside.  At this rate, Star Citizen will be out before this game's dead on arrival campaign.  Unless they shift gears again, save your money.Edit as of August 2016: The devs are now trying to sell out, and can't even do that properly.  This game is a dead, shambling corpse that has been lining the wallets of a seemingly 100% inactive dev team.  For the love of the game, DO NOT BUY IT.			"

								A very excellent game, developed well. For a Early Access this game has very small amounts of bugs and runs very well and looks fantastic even on low graphics.The gameplay is amazing for currently only one game mode team domination the gameplay isn't repetitive and is always fun. Planning your attack on the objective or finding a nice spot to defend. This game has very well designed map allowing players to flank their enemies and conquer the enemy.The weapon handling is very smooth feel realistic and the character animations and controller are smooth and easy to use.I highly recommend this game to all the first person shooters out there and to those who love Sci-Fi atmosphere, you always feel immersed in this game.

								First and foremost, the number of people playing this game is what hurts it the most. You'll struggle to find a server to play on or anyone to play with.Second, it's really hardcore. I'm not at all sure why they show these marines wearing heaps of armor when it clearly doesn't do much for them. The game is ""realistic,"" meaning you drop the moment you're shot.Combine these two things, and here's what you get:Very few chances to play with others, and when you do, you die the instant you run into them in the game.I'm sure if you invest hours upon hours, you'll eventually get to the point where you don't consistently die the moment you run into somebody else, and soon you'll dominate a little ant hill nobody elsee comes to. If that's your idea of fun, then by all means. Throw your money at this.Otherwise, it's hard to recommend. The game is beautiful, the setting is neat, and I love the concept. It's just no ♥♥♥♥ing fun to play. Everyone is made of glass, the game is buggy (early access, so expected), and I don't really see a light at the end of the tunnel for dealing with all of that.			"

								Given a chance to review this game I thought I was coming into a simple survival FPS game. When I began to play more I quickly relaized my first thoughts were not on point. While this is an FPS and their is a survival element I was pleasantly surprised by the scary tactics and horror this game brought in. It reminded me of F.E.A.R somewhat as their was always ambient noises that could scary you by themselves. I went into more detail on a review I did.

Pros:The Game shows huge pentential to grow. What I mean by that is being an early access game and in alpha it already has a feeling of almost being complete. This means there is still going to be so many things added to the game that will flesh it beyond what already it is.Horror ascpects get you. The Game is lethal a simple tackle or a few shots and your dead from the AI because they are not forgiving. It gives you the sense of realism in the game and immerses you to the point where all the running, clanks, and movement of enemies truely get you on edge and scare you.Co-op is amazing and well done.Cons:Its in Alpha so there are optimatization issue and clipping when going up and down in an elevator. This is to be expected as the game is still in beginning stages and has a lot to go so I am not worried theses issues will continue. Highly Recommend this game to everyone!			"

								I really want this game to survive, there's three developers, low income, no publisher and basically everything bad that can happen to a developer has happened to these guys. This game's concept is brilliant, the future plans are amazing and I  really  hope this game can be saved.I'm gonna buy Spearhead Edition very soon, not for the perks, but so that maybe I can help in at least the slightest.-----""But HuskyWolf, why the hell should  I  buy this game?! Is it actually worth the buy for gameplay?!""Yes, fellow steam user; The game is a tactical FPS with some sort of horror element to it that I personally love. The sound of robotic footsteps, beeping noises and loud sirens makes for a sureal experience where keeping your eyes open and your ears active is crucial for your success. There's also PvP multiplayer which, currently isn't too enjoyable.It's not all that boring, but currently there isn't much that can change the experience enough for it to be very different each game.All-in-all it's a great game, and with the addition of camos to keep me coming back, I hope that this game becomes the well known, great game that it deserves to be. And if that's what the game finally becomes after years of breakdowns and challenges, I want to be one of the people who stood up and said that we believed in it.Thankyou for your time.EDIT: I have now bought Spearhead! :D			"

Early Access Review
								Let me start my review by saying this game is not complete quite yet, but as far as I'm concerned, it mind as well be a full game. In essence, Interstellar Marines is a tactical FPS simulation game with sci-fi and mild horror influence. Even though there are some premises and technology that are currently not existent in modern day, it feels realistic. I feel like that in ten years or so, this is could be reality, especially with good physics, annoyingly lifelike recoil, pain and exhaustion wobble and other environmental effects on your condition and visor. The 'realistic' difficulty is certainly true to its title: it is a true challenge to complete tasks with that difficulty active.First off: gameplay. As of yet there are about 10 singleplayer missions of ranging objective, such as escaping a space station, clearing an area of hostiles, or restoring power to a building. In every mission you have two long weapons (no handgun, which I am not personally happy with) : one for longer range sniping, and one for fast, full auto, close range bursts. Recoil makes handling both of these weapons a great task, especially when scoped in. A silencer, laser and flashlight can be utilized at any time. The enemies are (in every mission I've done so far) robots. They have fairly good AI, and can be pretty fearsome when charging out of the darkness with ear splitting shrieks and slamming you around. They can recognize your flashlight and triangulate your position accordingly. Some are armed with weapons similiar to your own, and some use only their limbs. As for co-op/multiplayer: it's amazing. I love it. Some of the best co-op I've ever played in any game, ever. The tactical potential is immense. Working with your team mates to complete objectives and eliminate other players or robots is the best feature of this game. Nothing to be missed there. I personally much prefer the co-op to the multiplayer, as objectives often seem distorted and chaos seems to ensue in player vs. player scenarios. It is also frustrating to be killed in dark maps, where your enemies may be in a shadow, so they are invisible (or practically so) to you, but you are standing under a light. There is also no spawn protection, which can also prove to be aggravating.Secondly: graphics. Absolutely stunning. The vigetting, superb textures and smooth atmospheric lighting truly makes this game a joy to look at. Some of the best lighting work I've seen in a long time. The way that each map has it's own feel and atmosphere is almost completely a result of the fantastic graphical work by the developers. 10 years have obviously been put to good work. The sound design is also very good. The maps are dynamic, as they change weather, time of day and general status (emergency lockdown, totally silent, in tranisition, etc.). In each mode, the sound adds very well to the atmosphere. The sound of the rain is consistent; robots' groans and creaking adds to the tension and fear of a startling encounter; the overwhelming sound of gunfire accurately represents how an actual warzone would sound. And now, the conclusion.Singleplayer --> 8/10Graphics --> 9/10Co-op --> 9/10Multiplayer --> 7/10Replay Value (singleplayer) --> 7/10Sound design --> 9/10Overall --> 8/10. Fantstic game, would recommend to any sci-fi/simulation/FPS/tactical fan.			"

								With half life and rainbow six as inspiration, this game has enough thrilling game play, even now as an early access game.  The things that surprised me positively is the pace and the environment. The graphics is nothing much, but the sound system and the ambiance makes it very easy to forget anything IRL and focus on the menacing robots down the corridors.			"

Early Access Review
								Another early access game that's essentially dead.  The game has technically been in development for ten years now.  Unfortunately they don't have the raw financial resources that the developers and publishers of Duke Nukem Forever had, so it's doubtful they'll ever complete this game.  It's a shame, too, because the concept is great and the foundation that is here is a good one.  But that's really all there is; the foundation.  Occasionally a board or a brick will get put up, but it's almost certain that funding will run out before even a fraction of the grand design is built.  And even if by some miracle it does come to fruition, I hope they make the single player really good because the multiplayer population is already gone.			"

Early Access Review
								Hello Art Vandelay here, I bought this game not knowing what to think, 20$ is a lot of money for a game you never play. Well let's get to the review, the game is in early alpha and will get a lot of features in the future. I for one am really happy with the in-game mechanics, things like lense flare and the option to take of your interactive mask make it all the more exiting. Before i bought the game i thought it would be a Action Adventure game set in space, I could not be more wrong. the CO-OP games have some of the best horror elements added to a game since... well ever. I am not pleased to say that the multiplayer is finished, i was able to find a dedicated server but the only gamemode you can play right now involves a spawn time that is well over a minute.Overall i was really happy with my purchase of Interstellar Marines, the 2 guns that you can choose from are well balanced and have a good feel to it, i noticed the in-game community is very friendly and helpfull. The devs are really good to, they update the game on a weekly basis.9 out of 10: Would pay the double amount for a game like this, it was worth every penny.!!!			"

								I know this game is on active developing. There's not enough financing, but why so slow? 3 types of weapons, no melee, one type of AI enemy and not much options to play. After 4 years (or more, not sure) we got jumping, new SMG model, AR and ""pistol"", Hell Week and couple of levels.I understand it's small team with limited finances, but really, before to bring more gameplay content, just give us more weapons to use full combat experience. 4 years of crude shooter mechanics and nothing more.Anyway, it's EARLY ACCESS game, you paying for it because you want to support developers. If you seeking for play, do not wait from this one anything genious! Pay if you really interest on this, in other case just pass by.			"

Early Access Review
								Before we begin, let's go back. Like, 9 years back. 2008 back. I was a secondary school boy. I was still playing stuff like Blackshot and Soldier Front back when they were still popular. I  played Fallout 3 that year as well. So me being an FPS guy I somehow stumbled upon a demo of this game. Don't remember how though. It was using the Unity engine, and ran on a browser. I think Unity was still new back then, or at least unheard of by me. But a full 3D game with that kind of graphics on a BROWSER? Boy was my mind blown. It looked so good back then. Gameplay wise it was pretty solid too, with nice HUD and shooting elements. Granted it only had a shooting range with target challenges as far as I recall, but it was good enough for me. I was hyped. I wanted to see how the idea would expand. How they would incorporate the shark-like creatures that they showed off (somewhere...).Fast forward to...2014. I finally bought the game. And I finally got around to getting myself on Steam. I played it a bit. And somehow...I was underwhelmed. It's like they sat around on their asses for 6 years and did jack ♥♥♥♥. Where's the alien sharks? Ok, cool there's A.I. robots and a bit of multiplayer. Nice and all. But...nothing else? Yeesh. I stashed it aside. Maybe it'll get better.Fast forward again...to 2016. Booted it up. Been nearly two years since I tried it out. Maybe they added something cool. They did. I guess. A confusing scavenging mode spanning multiple levels and ridiculous A.I. bots, and more robot levels I guess? But where's that ALIEN SHARK? Did I miss a memo? Should I go off and sift through info online for a game I lost interest? No.To be honest the game's development cycle seems...tragic. Being stuck in this limbo for so long means that all investor interest probably died (along with anyone's interest probably). So...What happens now? It's been 9 years. Far too long. And I haven't touched upon the core gameplay. Here goes...I guess...- Generic FPS shoot-em-up gameplay. Move, shoot, aim down sights. Sprint. Crouch. - Cool visor that you can lift up mechanic thingy. Removes HUD. Clearer view I guess.- Weapon option mod thingy. Remove silencers! Turn on lasers! Blind others' with your light! That's all.That's about it. To be honest I have no interest of writing this game. That...died out 9 years ago.TL;DR game's stuck in a developmental limbo, and devs can't be ♥♥♥♥ed to push out anything soon enough. There's no incentive for them to do so. Sadly. A good idea...gone.			"

								This so far is an enjoyable game in the early stages of development. The depressing part is that in the TWO YEARS it's been in Early Access on Steam, it hasn't progressed past the early stages of development. There are two maps of a solo/co-op campaign, a few other solo/co-op gamemodes and (in my admittedly limited experience) a bit of lackluster PvP. Do not buy this game if you are expecting it to be a finished product any time soon. If you are ok with playing for a few hours every several months when there is new content to play, you might enjoy this game. For very brief periods.			"

								The most promising game I ever seen and I seen a lot.From the times of Commodore 64 until now, so many lonely space stations I have visited, but nothing compares to NeuroGen!In co-op NeuroGen is just great, but I dare you to try it in singleplayer!Even on easy difficulty you'll be terrified, but on realistic it's like the name of achievement suggest-psychosis.Alone in huge station, complete dark for at least 1/3 mission (with flashlight on SMG of course, you are marine), and...well, see it for yourself!Even if there is only that one mission finished, game is well worth buying, but the rest is very good too.Multiplayer is nice and I have not complaining, but the real deal is co-op games.Community is friendly atmost and all in all, game is real gem!Even if developers never finish the game, this now available content is beyond every expectations considering quality.And the feeling that I am part of something so extraordinary gives my somewhat old wings (42yr now) a boost, and this review is part of that feeling.

Early Access Review
								I got this game from steamgifts two or three years ago. I remember playing it then and thinking how much potential it has. So I decided to play it in 2017 and was very disappointed. The gameplay didn't change at all. Though they added a new gamemode like co-op/singleplayer missions in whih you have to fight off hordes of stupid AI robots. Actally, that's the only gamemode you can play, because the multiplayer is dead now. There are like 5 or 6 weapons in this game and they don't feel different from each other. Maps are small and the buildings are small gray boxes, just what you would expect from Unity3d game. Pros:-You might have some fun if you're playing co-op missions with friends-Immersion(you can see your feet and your helmet visor can be damaged)-The graphics are good for 2013Cons:-Maps are boring -Few weapons-Not much variety in gameplay-Dead multiplayer-Development hellIn short:The game has potential, but I don't recommend buying it in this state. There are absolutely no guarantees that it will ever be completed.			"

								I bought this game 2 years ago, there have been virtually NO real updates to the content of the game at all in that time. I bought the 4 pack of the game and really, I've been ripped off royally. Not only has the development died, the studio has also flat out lied in it's early marketing promising new additions that have never come. If you are expecting to be a Space Marine, breaching and clearing ships or stations, don't expect that at all. You will be fighting underground in a training facility against a dead player base or robots.Do not spend your money on this scam, if not a scam then a massive mismanagement of time and resources that have lead to literally no real content updates in 2 years. 0/10			"

								I love this game. Its a nice solid shooter base, with incredible immersion. The atmosphere that the game creates in the basic stealth missions turns it into a slight horror game! The training bots that the Singleplayer puts you up against, make some really nice sounds which makes it easy to tell where they are; but this just makes the stealth more tense! I play quite a lot of horror games, and this was making me jump on a regular basis. There is nothing ""Scary"" about the game. Its a standard FPS. But the atmosphere that the game makes caused me to get rather scared just walking around the stealth mission!Most definatley reccomended. Fast paced FPS, great engine, runs well (Maxed on GTX 780 getting 160FPS Avg)I see this becoming a very popular FPS. Cant wait for more modes and features!!!			"

								I think this is a must-buy game for anyone who likes teamwork in a first-person shooter game.Interstellar Marines has a lot of feature I have never seen in any other FPS before, like changing weather patterns, lighting, and even near-total darkness in a single map, changing between various settings.  This game keeps you on your toes, and gets my heart-racing with intense king of the hill combat.Edit as of 2016I'm still playing the game, so that probably says something.Since my initial review they've added crouching, and jumping; as well as two new weapons, three new game-modes, co-op and singleplayer missions.  The communtiy is still one of the best I've ever been a part of, and the gameplay is still fun, and enjoyable.I've probably bought 20 or 25 copies of this game for friends of mine over the past two years.  As of now, the Dev team has shrunk a lot, and they're looking for a publisher before they start doing any major updates; but if you're fine with just a smei-competetive shooter, and some neat co-op on the side with a fun community, you're $10 will be well spent.I've gotten over 250 hours of enjoyment (and counting) out of my $10; that's a pretty good return if you ask me, since it took less then an hour for me to make that $10...Every purchase helps this company, ZPS, continue pushing forward to creating and polishing up an amazing game, and if you're okay with mostly multiplayer now, and are hopful for more in the future; I'd highly reccomend picking this one up.

								Game is atmospheric and fun, but there isn't enough content to justify buying it, and the rate of updates is far too damn slow.What Steam doesn't tell you is this game has actually been in development since 2009. It's literally been in development hell for 7 years.Basically, it's trying to be Rainbow 6 in space with a Mass Effect esque single-player campaign added in. To be honest, I don't see how the finished product will be anything more than a dumbed down version of Star Citizen's single-player campaign. Sadly, Star Citizen's single-player will probably come out before this game does - even if Interstellar Marines does find an investor to help with funding.			"

Community Created Artwork for Interstellar Marines

Overview - I am a Spearhead Edition Buyer. Funny thing is they've never added the Hall of Honor, or Credits. [probably because it's not officially, ""released.""]Honestly, IM is a great idea. It's actually been released for way longer than people think - there was a kongregate version like 5/6 years ago where it was just a training simulator and you couldn't move around much. I also talked a friend into getting the game since it had alot of potential like 2 years ago when the game was almost exactly the same game it is today.http://www.interstellarmarines.com/game/ where you can play those DemosI have a theory as well that this is all a dream/VR training simulator in the reality of the I.M. world.This is a good game though barebones, it's not worth buying unless the Developer team[which is about 2 people from what I see going on in forums] secures major money[that won't come from sales] in order to develop the game. It seems to me what they're trying to do now is make a presskit to get another company involved in the making, so the game would finally get made. I guess it's better that the game be finished although I doubt it'll happen the way they want it to if another company picked it up. Bottomline Unless you see yourself playing the game with your active friends I would steer away.BUT OFC the way to fix ALL Of these negative reviews is just to add content - make the game worth playing. The game mechanics right now are pretty much perfect except for stuff like prone and upgrade trees for skills/stuff like that... you would think that in the future we would have light intensity adapting visors.[when we have this in real life already]I honestly would not mind if you guys added a bunch of content and then cleared the reviews just to see how the current build would stack up w/ people.For now here's what the game offers:4 Player Co-op: 2 maps of Elimination, 2 maps of Survival, 1 map of Escape, 2 long-length story missions.PvP: 8 Vs. 8 I believe in Deadlock and EliminationVarying A.I. Difficulties from I can't see you! to 1-shot you're dead :)Unfortunately, nothing is ""really new"" since the Neurogen v3 update from way BACK.Pros+ Great Idea+ Good for groups of 4 friends or more, if you're playing Hell Week.[warning points split]+ No achievements that are really too hard if you get medium skilled players together, so it'll be a blast for a group of FPS loving friends.+ standard PVP[nothing too special or different from the rest]+ Great PVE+ Sound is perfect.+ Combat points - Weapon/Backpack/Camo Skins, but a very weak positive in order to increase replayability.Cons- The money already spent in making this game - it's been years since that initial fanfunding project. I know that the main dev only does graphical stuff, but maybe try taking on programming interns from your local college/DIY groups, so that they can get credits.- Shark mainpoint of IM has yet to be released into the game.- Only a few people behind this game now AFAIK.- Low game population.- E time to get magazines?- Old issue of Pistol...I do not want this in my inventory/want an option to drop this piece of ♥♥♥♥/don't want to mousewheel to this gun when i'm empty on both of the automatics + looks too much like an SMG. I think you guys need to remodel it to something more traditional. Honestly, we're carrying a carbine length pistol[~15inches], sub-machine gun[~11inches] and a RIFLE[18+ inches]?- No shotguns- No snipers- Hell week is boring because there's not enough robot action, but it shouldn't be like every inch is a battle, but more robots than it currently has.- No improvements/additions to A.I./Robotic Enemies AFAIK.- Fall through map bug[Just rejoin the game unless you're alone then you're screwed]- You can clip through closing doors- So2 should be o2 or Co2- Groups of Robots[deadly] suddenly spawning in front of you- Non-solid floors/areas of glitching to abuse.- No penalty of PKing in Hell Week regardless of intercom stating that there is a penalty ,-,.- No Prone- Robots can blind you through walls with flashlight*note to developers*If you could get your game featured at a gaming con it would probably be a huge boon to your game's success though you'll have it pick up/release things faster like bi-weekly.

 Specifics The IM Project began 11 years ago. In order to secure funds they began by releasing a few Demos through public game places like The Vault, Bullseye, and Running Man. The greenlit Steam game was released on July 2, 2013 and I can't remember back then if the game was just barebones PvP, or had the Co-op Missions as well. ""On October 2012, Zero Point Software attempted to do a Kickstarter campaign with a $600,000 pledge by November 28, 2012. Their campaign failed to meet its funding goal, with only $157,906 raised from 3,823 backers.""That's a shame that they didn't get the money even if the campaign failed :(Ex. List of expenses...Electricity, Building Rental if not working at a home which is way more economical of indie devs, Musical Composition[people say it could cost Free, or $280-$2000 per song/minute/soundtrack], The main developer is graphical, so it's down to coding[huge job], server costs[anywhere to $20-$400+/month], food, sound effects, special effects, ect.I guess it's good that we even got the 1st part of the trilogy done if you assume the $200k mark is where they were splitting the money per part.

								Ok, the entire reason this game has negative reviews is because development has been slow. That's it. The devs are incredibly undermanned.The devs have however stuck to the game (unlike a lot of early-access games) and have been (at time of writing) talking about getting support from a publisher. So hopefully the development will speed up soon.That said, it's a glorious game with amazing promise. The current open-world survival-ish gamemode is pure gold. The pvp is lacking, but it DOES advertise itslef as a mainly coop game so whatevs.			"

								In its' current state, this game is not very good at all. Originally it was to be a very ambitious tactical sci-fi shooter; with dynamic VoIP acoustics, customisable weapons, and different character classes. Currently, there is none of that, unless you count attaching a silencer as customisation.There is currently a short threadbare campaign available that consists of three missions on three different maps, not counting the tutorial. These all feel very similar and do not help demonstrate the game's ""tactical"" gameplay, as it is very simple to run-and-gun as the enemies are not very bright and infinite ammo is available.The saddest part is that it could have been better, had it had more funding. In promotional material, and partially in the game, characters are able to remove their helmet to talk clearer and to see easier. When your visor is down, it is almost similar to Metroid Prime or Star Wars: Republic Commando, with raindrops and sunlight glare obscuring your vision when it is down. In promotional material, this was also shown to change the sound of your voice, with your voice being more muffled when the visor is down, and clearer when the visor is up. Unfortunately, this feature is not available in the game and probably never will be. To sum it up, let me recount and experience whilst poking around the game. If you clip inside the player character's helmet, you will find a fully modelled, but untextured face. It looks ready to be used, but unfortunately never is. This sums up the game, potential is there, but the game itself is incomplete.Rip in pepperoni			"

								TL;DR ""DO NOT BUY IT YET, WAIT UNTIL EARLY ACCESS ENDS""Interstellar Marines is futuristic, online tactical first person shooter which has unique gameplay elements. In example you're actually playing in a virtual battleground which changes its' weather settings, platform levels and there is ""day/night"" cycle.The gameplay has a realism aspect in its' own way. Projectile damage is high. Dark is really dark; you have to find your way with your flashlight and using momentary lightings such as thunder or a malfunctioning light sources etc. You have a helmet which contains your GUI but time by time it limits your view because of raindrops or dusty particles on the helmet glass; so you have to elevate its' front side from your face.So, why don't i recommend this game to you (...yet)? Simple: Updates are occasional, framerate is still horrible despite the fact that developing process started a long time ago. Gameplay elements are still missing according to their gameplay plans but it's kind of OK. It has a dedicated player community as i see but they are few (or they are just playing the game when a new update comes).Keep this game in your mind if you like tactical shooters but don't buy it yet.

								It sounded great, had great concepts and features and the co-op and missions sounded amazing. I followed the game and the videos and website before it even went to Kickstarter, it's received plenty of funding and support, years of early access and is still no where near what was expected. It's been out on Steam since 2013 and the progress really is dissapointing. I had high hopes but they keep dragging it along and giving false hope. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this game. Shoot some robotic dolls and other people with some decent graphics. Many free-to-play sci-fi/tactical/FPS surpasses this.			"

								I bought into this game wowed by the developers' crazy concept of creating a new universe populated by man eating sharks with legs. Though it said Early Access, I brushed it off, thinking the game would be completed by a year, two years maximum. It's been over three years and the only things added are a base AI, three types of guns, jumping, and sprinting. Other than that, all this is is just a very crude, very base FPS that feels like it's been left to rot on the table.I understand the dev team is undergoing some troubles, but why are the updates so far and few between? At most, this is just a tech-demo with ""missions"" slapped onto it. Unless you plan to buy this just to help out the dev team, don't bother with this ""game"". This is light-years from being finished. "

I still hold hope in its eventual completion, hoping that Zero Point gets the funding and support necessary to do so.

								This is by far the biggest mistake of a purchase i have ever made in my life. I bought the spearhead edition thinking maybe i could contribute to the designers of this game that originally looked really good.  PROS-The gfx, sounds and atmosphere is really nice           -Has a pretty good concept(lots of potential) CONS- Forever in early access           - Lack of Everything (only 2 guns, litterally 1 or 2 playable online rooms..)           - The content that is available is very bland and repetative.           - I have a lot of problems with the controlls bugging out and not being able to move at times. The Devs are extremely defensive about complaints and dont want to hear anybodys ♥♥♥♥, instead of taking it as constructive critisism.  For how long this game has been in development, its really not going anywhere and seems like it just stopped and is completely deserted. I am trying my hardest to see if steam can refund this for me. Its infact so bad that i didnt give any friend my FREE copy of the game.			"

								""Anyone who buys this game and feels tricked or exploited by what they got can get a refund from Steam no questions asked"" is what this dev said.i attempted to refund it in hopes of getting money back for a different game, maybe something that isn't early access, and it got denied.i enjoyed this game at first, but when i attempted to play with my friends, it was an absolute mess, and took us quite a while to play one co-op game. theres no feel to the guns, almost like im using a toy. creating a server is horrible, theres no way to make it private (from what i saw).all the enemies were melee, so there were no threats at all. the only thing that delayed us was finding where to go.graphics are actually quite nice. very smooth. animations were ok, some were a little jaggedy at times.but generally an unfun game. i may not have 300 hours into it, but thats because i didn't like it enough to play past one level with my friends. and that was a challenge in itself.tl;drdev promised refunds, didn't get one, making server with friends is difficult, and enemies are useless. graphics are nice though. 3/10			"

Right now there is too little content to recommend it and after two years we don't even have a ONE interesting co op map with sharks. Yep, just robot AI. Which gets old quick. Hud is very minimal and its easy to get lost that however is not a bad thing. I like exploration but I would appriciate some sort of radar or compass to help me find key objectives. Combat wise is pretty standard FPS experience with addition of BEHOLD taking off your helmet... wow. 3 Guns couple of co op maps with stupid robots ( they are all the same, at least make some effort and have variety of robots, like melee ones, shotgun ones and kamikaze ones lol )Waited far too long and at this state and slow updates I cant recommend it yet.

								I bought this game because it promised 4-player co-op and some sort of shark creatures. It's been two years since the multiplayer shooter portion of the game released, and there's just no development toward campaign aspects whatsoever. There are a few maps to shoot robots in, a few maps to shoot people in, and your choice of Gun A or Gun B.The environments look great, the gunplay is serviceable, but development is downright glacial. It's looking less and less like we'll see a sprawling space epic with Land-Sharks before 2050 (or rather, before the money runs out).If all you want is to shoot some bland test dummies or creep around in the same 5 or so maps, then by all means buy in. If you're looking for a co-op shooter where you fight sharks, you'd be better served by 'Depth' or 'Shark Attack Deathmatch 2' here on Steam.			"

								This is a great and different FPS game, that has a interesting story to it, then most of the other FPS out there.Well if a FPS game with a mutation of a shark sound like cool, and are abit tired of all the zombie games - then give this a try.It might be early access, so take the bugs and glitches as they are - i am sure they fix it in the end.To those that start, with i have a low playtime on it here! Sure and true in steamBut did play before steam, so i know the game.Some of us do have kids and a real life, plus i own around 850 games to play when i can.I did support them before they went on steam, as they went on kickstart.Finaly they made it on steam, after greenlight.I do hope they get success with the game, as they have been trying hard to make this game work.Also as a born Dane, i want to support them with the spearhead version.So come give them a hand back in Denmark, as its a damn expensive tax country ;-)			"

What can we do?ADD MORE PVP MAPS AND SKINS THAT LOOK ALL THE SAME WITH LITTLE EFFORT THAT WILL BRING THEM BACK!!But why not add coop mode against thos shark enemies we promised?THEY ARE A GLITCHY MESS!! SCRAP THEM OUT OF THE GAME!!WONT THAT ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE OFF!!NAAAHH PROBEDLY NOT!! PEOPLE ARE HAPPY TO JUST SHOOT RANDOM AI ROBOTS THAT STAND STILL MOST OF THE TIME, NEVER GOES FOR COVER AND GOT THE WIERDERS TYPES OF HITBOXES AND AIMBOT ON HARDER DIFFICULTIES.To get serious, It's never gona be complete.. And anyone writing a positive review is lying out of there asses as they hope enough suckers will buy it and throw more money the developers way in hope that it will be enough to save this piece of garbage.. But no.. Do not fall for it. .Let this die out.. I paid for it.. I relize my mistake.. Why whould i load my sinking ship with more hopefull spirits.♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME.Answer to Ypulse comment:Reign of kings. Life is feudal has people on 24/7, H1Z1 got people one 24/7. This doesn't.. And anyone owning the game knows that. Sure maybe occasinly a server would get some people.. Perhaps even fill up? But that I doubt. And now you as everyother pathetic individual trying despretly to defend there garbage pile. You pull your last card, By stating how low amount of play time I have.You know who else did that? Digital homicide against Jim sterling Took his video down and stated that he individualy violeted the copyright as the review was not based on what was there view on a minimal play time on record to be able to provide a valid review.. The truth sadly for your kind is that there is no minimum time.. Of course someone with 500h+ may have deeper insight to a game then somone with 50min but most of the time then it proves that the game is actually good.. As if somone can waste 500+ on the game it should add up to something and I yet find many people shouting out a bad review after that amount of time If not it been based on a recent update that the developers pushed out that changed the game drasticly for the worse. Still none should be forced to implement a certain amount of time to be able to state there opinion, specialy when the fact exist all around you. I did not need more then 10 min For Garry's shity incident, I did not need more then 5 min for zombies on a plane.. I needed not more then 2h for this game..   Now this 2h LOL..  As you so kindly stated is about 10 min each put out in 12 sessions.. the game never manage to capture me for more then 10 min in each session as i notice it was a bland shooter with some interesting ambient lightning effects that i can praise but not much there else. And the game developers themself have both in video and devblog stated that this was going to be a core COOP experience and pvp was going to come second.. Still there effort and Development plan has and still to this days proves otherwise as they continue to jam in things direclty aiming for the pvp and even less focuse for the coop.. I not seen anything done for the coop in the past 6 months. The game simply in coop action is. you and 3 others, Sneak/assault in on a base with stupid Robot AI that wanders around and have aimbot if you turn them up for anything more then normal. And any announcement for further plans seems to be going down the drain and i bet it's cause of financial problem. And here Is where it becomes sad.. That the fanboys themself must despretly throw out positiv reviews in hope of dragging more innocent souls to the fire in hope that the body pile will become big enough to climb up to the heavens themself.. SOmething I doubt very much as the company itself most likely are looking for an exit plan as I write this..  But I keep your opinon to a very facinating level.. And If they and if so you.. proves me the wrong. .Then win/win as i myself was looking forward to this game.. I just don't feel the need to lie to other people to get to my toys.			"

								This game has been in Early Access for YEARS. I bought the Spearhead edition only to find that they had released the Spearhead edition on Humble Bundle where it was sold for 1/10th the price I paid for it. What was the devs response? ""Sorry guys"". Sorry doesn't cut it. That's not just a PR problem that can be solved with an apology. An apology didn't cost you $43.00. On their website, they're selling ""badges"" for $5.00 a piece as a ""cookie for the devs."" Maybe before you try to extort your ignorant fanbase, you should actually attempt to finish the game.  What exactly are those worth? Nothing to me. You know what I would like? A completed damn game. I've come to the conclusion that these guys are capitalizing on the indie trend, profiteering, and have made it their careers to profit off of a game that will remain perpetually in Early Access.EDIT: Half a year later and no updates. Over 3 years later and still in early access. Also, if you think this is rant or if you think this is a conspiracy theory that the devs are capitalizing on the indie trend. It's impossible to review this game any further because the servers are always empty. Wasted money and wasted time.			"

								Yes they are slow with development but it really is a great game. The graphics are pretty good and gameplay is quite amazing and is VERY atmospheric with things like the day/night change even going completely dark in some cases, rain, and snow. There's fatigue and unsteady aim after sprinting, rain droplets and affects on your helmet. It's also pretty realistic on the realistic difficulty, a few hits and typically your dead or damn near it and so are the enemies(minus the bosses of course). With a few friends you can have a riot of a time so I can't not recommend it for $10. Especially if its ever on sale, snag this sucker.			"

								Please read the following to get a decent perspective of the game before buying.Pros:- Very smooth, sleek design. Graphics are very nice.- Simple controls yet very immersive and very to understand.- Extremely immersive in nearly every aspect (Massive +).- Being stealthly is very rewarding (Mentally and in the game).- CO-OP is slightly more fun than single player.- Not the hardest game to run, but will require a decent PC.- Guns feel very nice and play better than i thought they would.- A.I is very smart, even on easy difficulty.- Devs seem to be more active than other communitys which is good.- Potentially great story.+ And a few more that i forgot xDCons:- Reloading while in cover is broken. The animation dosn't work correctly.- Hardly anyone online to play with, even the devs know. ""people will be on for you to play with, it is usually during the evenings in North America and Europe.""- When on some hard difficultys the A.I is a little too smart. They one shot very often.- Sandbox is sometimes broken. You fall striaght through the floor and never return which results in restarting the map.- A.I needs to be more... 'Workable'. Once you've been spotted, you're done for. The A.I, when aware you're around, totally ruine the immersion, i mean completely!- No checkpoints! This might be deliberate but holy crap is it fustrating. You play through a long missions then you make a wrong move, guess what? You're back at the start. Same goes for CO-OP. When you join they could be across the map and you're at the spawn.- Story is terrible. You start on the tutorial which is great fun, then... wait what? You're running around in some random facility. Story has been thrown out the window completely. Wrost thing is that the story has great potential.I would recommend that you buy this game. even though there are more cons than pros, because i think that if the devs stay active and keep updating then this will be something. This game has great potential, i believe, and i would like to see a more active community on it.  A few tweaks here and there and some updates mainly on the story then this game will have more pros than cons.			"

								A rather overlooked multiplayer FPS, which easily became one of my all-time favorites.What's great:+ It does darkness right. When there's no light source- you can't see ♥♥♥♥ for real and at the same time using flashlight/being near any light source would make you an easy target. It feels especially great when weather dynamically changes during online match- imagine sitting behind a rock, defending capture point when all of sudden night goes down and as sudden lightning strike brightens up your surroundings you can see enemy crawling to you through nearby swamp.+ Above makes co-op missions a thrilling and challenging experience, sometimes on par with actual horror games. Be tactical and watch your step around every corner or get eaten by scary FNAF robots.+ PvP multiplayer isn't brain-dead running around spray-and-pray like CoD, but rather careful slower-paced advancing on your objective. Most of the maps are quite open so you have to be vary about being seen and at the same time keep your eyes open because enemies don't have huge red marks above them.+ Gunplay is simple and basic, but solid and fun, rewarding quick reflexes and high accuracy.What's not so great:- It's dead.[steamcharts.com] Unless devs do a couple another free week promotions, i don't see it gaining new players.

								It's almost 2017, and this game has been in Early Access since 2013 (2010, but 2013 on steam) It's price also dropped from $20 to $10 which I can only assume is because the playerbase has dwindled significantly. Honestly I do hope this game makes it out of dev hell, but the lack of features and the amount of time this has been an Early Access title makes me think otherwise.  "

								While this game is currently in the early stages of development, I would highly suggest you pick this game up because it has a positive community, interactive developers and a very solid core experience. Most of you associate these types of business models as buy the game now and get rewarded later, but I believe that the devs have created a very basic yet solid gameplay experience. The devs are always involved with the community and constant updates bring new features to the game. I wouldn't worry about what the game looks like now because the devs have chosen to let you play what they have instead of giving the full product when its finished. Some of you may not like this type of development, but I like it because it makes you feel like you are connected to the devs and your opinions are heard.			"

								Interstellar Marines is an immersive and addicting FPS that sets the bar high. The game prides itself with jaw dropping environments, dynamic lighting, and realism that will challenge your approach to combat. Interstellar Marines is currently sporting two missions in single player mode, co-op, and a plethora of multiplayer modes that'll keep you busy for a long while. It also handles extremely well on my aging hardware of 7+ years with impressive load times. The developers at Zero Point Software actively support the game with large updates and new quality content; even adding skins more recently. The player base is lacking but that's understandable for an early access. The game offers a healthy amount of achievements. Interstellar Marines plays like a finished product and, for $9.99, is definitely a must have.+Realism+Dynamic Environments+Replayability+Offline bots+Multiplayer/co-op+Achievements+Cross-Platform Multiplayer+Active developers-Player base-Cards			"

								They should focusing on CO-OP and making an awesome story then just pvp.Also since this has huge potential, where's the solo campaign?The dev's have been showing this awesome universe and all were seeing is training routines.AM I TRAINING TO BE A SPACE MARINE OR AM I A MARINE?Also the dev's are focused on making pvp good. WHY? This game has so much potential to be a fun story based game with yourself or your friends, and I hate the fact that they're wasting so much time on something that shouldn't exist in this type of game. Alright but enough hating on the game, the gameplay itself is amazing i've never had much fun in a game in awhile. The Co op is perfect nothing is better than playing with your friends trying to stealth through a base. Also don't play co op missions on your own I actually got scaried once. Yeah.			"

								There isn't much of a game yet, it only consisted of 2 guns, an assault rifle and an smg of sorts.  However the atmosphere is really well done.  Despite it's current simplicity the dark atmosphere and ability to shoot out lights to make it even darker is an unusual factor in the multiplayer FPS genre (which tend to have reasonably lit dark places or else supply night vision).  Along with the dark and deathly silent atmosphere you have enemies which are humanoid robots, however, as boring as that may seem, i've never had robots freak me out this much.  Some of them are like fast zombies but they sneak right up on you before slapping you silly.My favourite factor of this game is definitely the fact that you get the feeling you're the only ones alive.  All there is is silence, that is very realistically unnerving when broken by sudden un-silenced gunfire.There are some issues with objective bugs and flashlights not rendering from other players, i find the walking/movement to be a bit jerky and awkward, and as i said there isn't much content yet: limited guns, only 2 types of enemy with the same model, and fairly empty maps.  While i like the atmosphere, i hope the game won't all be quite so barren and basic (when it comes to missions and so on).  I guess i'll look forward to when this game gets some more meat on it.

Important editI forgot why i stopped playing this game aside from the lack of change, but i got a quick reminder when i placed a topic asking about the development and whether the old features are going to be added in.I instantly got reminded; the community is small, but INCREDIBLY toxic and elitist. Most of the people that play this game are flashing their rank as if it is a real life military rank and they'll be sure to remind you of your playtime if you mention something that is not overly positive.Stay far away from this game if you don't have friends to play it with; the existing community is cancer.Original topic below.I've liked this game for a while but i have to turn in a negative review sadly enough.The game was very promising with unique HUD features, voice features and co-op features (♥♥♥♥ing shark monsters), and the gameplay is pretty nice overall.Sadly the game falls flat as it has been in early access for almost 3 years now (even longer before it hit steam) and the developers have failed to deliver anything surprising ever since.I barely even know what they added, i only know they added in a SMG, silencers and maybe a map? (not sure).So the HUD feature, being a helmet you can open at the cost of losing your HUD is pretty lame and useless, as it lacks a point of using it in the first place and isn't even shown on other players when they do it (laaaaaame).There's also no immersive voice system in the game anymore, meaning you won't hear people use voice chat ingame with realistic echoing and objects hindering the sound.As for the shark monsters; you're left with lame robots that run at you. Yeah..I may sound pessimistic here but in an early build they had all of these features were  in the game, sure probably not flawless but they were there, yet the developers decided it's more important to focus on cosmetic things and insignificant updates.As for now it's a somewhat decent tactical shooter but it has no reason to keep playing, especially not considering the playerbase is pretty dead (no ♥♥♥♥ after 3 years of no special content). No campaign, no missions, no persistent rewards/stats, no nothing.Basically the development fell flat and you shouldn't expect this game to reach full release with expected content.			"

Additionally, the planned features are going to make this game beautiful and exciting.Pros:- Dedicated, independent developers that are committed to making the game as atmospheric and detailed as possible- /\ That's really all you needCons:- While the development is in-depth, they test the stable branches excessively before release - long time between updates			"

I told myself ""Now is my chance."" I am glad I purchased it. Its challenging, and it forces you to take things slow. The first mission I did took me just over an hour. I was playing solo though. The game could use some optimization or at least let me turn shadows off completely. I am in the Army and live in the barracks, so I don't really have room for my desktop. I am playing on a decent laptop. It can run BF3/BF4 on Ultra no problem. I get a steady 30-40fps (@1280x720) when inside buildings, but sometimes when I am outside  it drops to about 20-25. I honestly didn't care because I felt it added to the overall tension and anxiety. I can usually never handle below 30fps, but this game has just got me hooked.Rig Specs:Nvidia GT740m (Running 1280x720)i7 4700MQ @ 2.44GHz8GB DDR3 RAM "

								I bought this game over 3 years ago on a promise and a lot of hyperbole about what the developers wanted to achieve. The product is not yet finished and it will be a little while longer before we have a full single player campaign. However, what is there is very good, by no means perfect, but very good none the less, and I have no hesitation in recommending it in its current state.Whats good:* Lots of different game modes, with the main game being team based PvP, but also a 4 player Coop story mode vs bots, and various other co-op player vs bots modes.* The AI on the bots is fun to play against and they offer a genuine challenge, and have on more than one occasion made me jump.* Very focussed gameplay, there are only 2 weapons and limited ammo in each clip, so every shot counts* Great community of people playing, there is quite a lot of chatter on the servers with players, and people are generally quite nice, funny, helpful.* Quick loading times to get into games* Great respawn idea, basically when you die you have to wait 2 mins before respawn, but if your team captures zones you get to respawn earlier. This makes the game quite tactical and differentiates it over your usual COD, counterstrike type gameplay.* The game can be tough for beginners, but experienced players can be quite helpful, so stick at it and it will come to you* The developers are occasionally found playing with/against you, this gives the feeling that they also enjoy playing the game and adds an extra bit of fun when they do.* Day/night mode on maps; the night mode makes things especially interesting, how often do you use the flashlight to see where you are going vs giving your position away. The positional sound of footsteps also can give you away / help you find people.* A bunch of other things I can't be arsed to type.Whats bad:* Despite selling a lot of copies of the game, and there being quite a lot of servers, only 1 or 2 of the main ones tend to fill up. However, once you are in at the right time of day the games are fun, in fact I have had quite a few 2v2 or 4v4 games that were amazing.* Lag. This to me is the games biggest issue, and can be quite frustrating at times, however, again with experience you can compensate for it by firing ahead of target. If there is one thing that needs some more TLC its the lag compensation and reducing overall lag when connecting to servers.* I play a lot of counterstrike and miss not being able to melee people, i would take anything over nothing, even if you had to charge melee up before striking. The prestige of being able to sneak up on someone and stab them in the back and embarass them would make this game twice as good.* Not much else other than its not finished, but like I said this is still a very good and polished gameOverall if want something a bit different then this game might be for you, also you can test some of the early stuff out on their website before committing: http://www.interstellarmarines.com/ or even watch a few videos of it on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/results?filters=hd&search_query=interstellar+marines&lclk=hd&spfreload=1edit: added link			"

								I was very excited for this ambitious game when I purchased it in early access. I have sadly learned to be skeptical of early access games. This looks like another example of a great concept from an ambitious team that took on more than they could handle with Interstellar Marines. Very slow updates, if any, near zero player base. This looks like the skeleton of what was once a popular kickstarter like game in space. The sad thing is the game wasn't half bad, if the dev team really went back and turned it into something, it could have had a chance.			"

								Before you buy this game, you must first realise that this is an alpha and is missing many of the features which they are working on for the final game. There is ONLY multiplayer and the 7 maps which you can look around/play in multiplayer.Having said that, this game is surprisingly polished for an alpha.. there is so much immersion, firing a weapon takes time to master and adds a good level of depth to the game. The weather changes on the maps, sometimes it goes pitch black or foggy which completely changes the tactics you use. Currently the game is also very balanced (due to there only being 1 weapon) so it feels satisfying to get good at the game knowing no one has an advantage.Some issues you need to be aware of: currently there is only 1 gun in the game and couple of game modes (team domination being the most used and the best), there are some issues with hit detection and lag *make sure you pick a server with low ping however even then you'll need to learn to lead the target a bit more etc* (also make sure you turn off smoothing in the options to help with this). They are fixing this but for now it's there. Also there is no crouching in the game, no leaning or anything like that.. I believe they want to add in these features.In conclusion, this is definatly an early alpha with many features missing... however I believe that the current strengths of the game (immersion, satisfying shooting and balanced multiplayer) make this 100% worth the asking price which will also help them continue development. Have a look at some more recent videos and make your judgement, it's changed a lot over the past month (december).			"

								Negative Comments are not 100% factual.MY RATING:Current Hours of fun gameplay: ~60hrs (enough MP maps to be fun for a while, a lot more coming)Graphics: 6.5/10 Maps: 10/10Sound: 11/10Gameplay: 9/10 (think original Ghost Recon or Rainbow 6 type Gameplay mixed with a bit of Quake depending on the map)Gamemodes 6.5/10 (A major game mode is currently in development and single player still needs work)Yes the company went bankrupt, yes their are only two weapons however what people are saying just isn't factual.1) Multiplayer IS TONS fun, their is deathmatch, team dm, a mode where you respawn a friend by getting a kill and another mode that I can't remember. Their are also 1 or 2 COOP missions and a game mode where you fight against bots.Think CSGO but with better maps, the maps are very good and have bushes and grass to hide in, the maps change as the game goes on (day, night, snow, rain, mist etc.). Even from South Africa and a ping of 200+ I had a lot of fun (ping doesn't mean much if you can hide in a bush and shoot a guy from behind, hope the make a small RSA server... please? please!).2) Excellent community, none toxic people that report bugs and make jokes, 2nd to none.3) Okay Graphics (COD level I would say, not BF level but acceptable), yes the graphics still overuse resources but my old GTX 660 OC does fine on highest @ 1080 and a 750ti will also. No need for a $300+ GPU.4) Best sounds ever, even BF3 falls behind on sound.5) Cheap, <$20 for a game that gives a lot of value and fun.If you Like the good old shooters (like Rainbow 6 and Ghost Recon originals) this is for you, you do regain health as far as I remember but it is basically 1 shot 1 kill. Tactics like not capping a point and shooting guys as they try and cap it are a must, teams of two also help (usually I get shot and my friendly then cleans up the enemy, as I say my ping is bad).HOWEVER SOME OF THE CRITICAL POINTS ARE TRUE:1) Original backers will be sour that they have had to wait years, I don't blame them or the devs as the game simply didn't get enough support from the FPS crowd.2) 2 Guns only, this is fine as the gameplay is basically 2 body or 1 head shot however more weapons are about to be released soon from what I have heard.3) The game is early access and their are a few bugs (far less then some post releases) and A LOT of content is coming (not a bad thing is it?).JUST BUY IT, IT Won't GO BANKRUPT AGAIN IF PEOPLE SUPPORT IT AND IT IS A GREAT GAME!

								Версия игры: 0.5.17 В принципе неплохая игра.Но есть ещё вещи, которые я бы в ней изменил/добавил/убралНе хватает: указания расстояния до метки задания (буква в ромбе): метки отображаются одинакового размера и она может находится как за ближайшей стеной в полуметре от тебя, так и на противоположном конце карты, но ты это узнаешь только после того как доберёшься до неё субтитров с текстом задания (на слух не всегда понятно что говорят, особенно при слабом знании английского или во время стрельбы) мини-карты с отображением ближайших союзников (ну вертеться же постоянно как юла, а по звуку не определишь) и целей задания информации о том, кто в данный момент говорит в голосовой чат (например как в CS: текст в каком-нибудь углу с ником говорящего и иконки возле метки над его моделью в игре) информации о том возраждает ли тебя союзник (не столь важно как предыдущие пункты, но тоже не помешало бы) возможность рукопашного боя (бить прикладом): довольно часто можно умереть во время перезарядки оружия потому что всадил в упор остатки патронов в робота, а он от этого не умерНадо бы изменить: локализацию звуков (очень тяжело, а скорее даже невозможно определить направление к источнику звука и  расстояние до него: например, робот может спокойно добежать до тебя и убить, пока ты отвлекаешься на что-то другое и думаешь, что он ещё далеко). Шум от робота в нескольких десятках метров примерно тот же по громкости, что и у того, что стоит вплотную к тебе много серверов от создателей игры - это хорошо, но всё же хотелось бы иметь возможность создать сервер на который можешь зайти только ты и те, кого ты туда пригласил лазерные целеуказатели хорошо бы активировать на разном оружии независимо (было бы удобно, хотя не очень уж и требуется) при получении повреждений хотелось бы знать примерное направление откуда атакуют (слева/справа/сверху/снизу)-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Version of game: 0.5.17 In principle this is a good game.But there are still things that I would have it changed/added/removedWhat is missing:     indicate distance to the mark with the task (letter in box): labels are displayed the same size and it can be found as for the nearest wall a foot away from you, and at the opposite end of the map, but you know it only after doberёshsya to her     subtitle text task (by ear is not always clear what they say, especially with poor knowledge of English or during shooting)     mini-map, displaying closest allies (well, to spin like a top as constantly, and the sound is not defined) and the objectives of the assignment     information about who is currently says in voice chat (such as in CS: text in any corner of the nickname and the speaker icon near the mark on his model in the game)     information on whether revives you ally (not so important as the previous steps, but also would not hurt)     melee combat (to hit with a rifle butt): quite often you can die while reloading weapons because stabbed emphasis remains of ammunition in the robot, and he did not die from itIt is necessary to change:     sound localization (very hard, and perhaps even impossible to determine the direction of the sound source and the distance to it: for example, the robot can safely run to you and kill until you get distracted by something else and think that he is still far away) . The noise from the robot a few meters to about the same volume as that of the fact that costs close to you     a lot of servers from the creators of the game - it's good, but still I would like to be able to create a server to which you can go just you and those you invited back     laser designators well be activated on different weapons independently (it would be convenient, but not very much and want to)     In case of injuries would like to know the approximate area where the attack (left / right / top / bottom)I apologize for the translation of text using Google			"

								Short review: don't get it, at all. Ever. ♥♥♥♥ these devs.Long review: If they work out the kinks and don't ♥♥♥♥ it up in the process? I still would not recommend this game because of the ♥♥♥♥ devs.As it stands right now? And has stood for a while now... (no updates, get it?)+ fun for about an hour or two+ water on your space helmet (lewd~)- Slow updates to the point where I think I'm scammed.- You can't host your own server (SERIOUSLY, WTF?!)- Joining is a pain, playing with your friends even more so, so why the hell buy that 4-pack anyways?- REAL ♥♥♥♥♥♥ netcode- No support for custom resolutions (Eyefinity/Surround/SoftTH? FORGET IT!)- Prides itself in being tactical, yet no leaning!- Regenerative health ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t- Barely any content- Same old gamemode- Unity- way too easyI kid you not, after 90 minutes? I was able to beat coop missions on realistic by myself easily.I also found a bug where you shoot past an enemy while he's in your face.I don't recommend this game. The risk of the devs screwing up this game is wayyy too big. I'm afraid this is gonna turn into another casual-pandering tumblr-appeasing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Add it to your wishlist and pirate it, or if you're so inclined on buying? At least do us all a favor and buy it on a sale in like a year or two, when there's more content. "

								Don't care about other people complaining, this game is funny, with awesome graphics, and very good AI. Yes, it's ""incomplete"" (compared to all promises made) but i consider this game still enjoyable even in it's state :You have  3 campaign missions, pvp maps, 2 survival maps, 2 extermination maps. Plus Hell Of The Week, a big pack of 9 maps that makes you feel the danger and like a scavenger looking for ammo and killing robots.If you have 10 bucks to spend, give it a try ;)THere is a very little people, but they are cool so it's fine :D			"

								This game is not fit to buy in its current state.  This is less of a recommendation and more of a warning.  The only current content consists of stripped down multiplayer and no single player at all.  You can walk around the multiplayer maps by yourself but that is it.  Basic things like jumping and crouching are currently missing from the game as of my writing this, sprinting was patched in about a week ago.  There is literally no weapon diversity and no AI.  I'm not saying this game won't turn into something worth playing, but right now it is not.  I'm not sure what to expect though, considering development began in May 2005, over 8 years ago.  I will update the review when and if the game enters a more acceptable state.			"

								Sure it's a nice shooter and all, actually I'd even call it a good shooter. But there is nothing about this game that sets it apart from all the others. If you've got 5 dollars to spare and want a cookie cutter carbon copy of every other first person shooter out there, go ahead, buy this game.But if you are like me, and are gaming on a budget, you can find a much better shooter, and game in general, elsewhere.5/10 nothing at all special.

								First time I heard of Interstellar Marines, I was amazed by their idea and I majorly wanted to help, however I had no money. But now in 2013 I had just received the game by a friend of mine who was a donator in the kick starter and had spearhead edition. When I opened this game I was surprised what they have done already ever since with their bankrupt and situations. They had been training really hard for an amazing comeback, and dedicate their whole life to this majestic game. The features at the moment may not seem much but it's worth the money. The feature it has is a wonderful dynamic environment and a normal run & gun at the moment. They had recently changed the game mode on all servers to Team domination, therefore you would have to work with your team to win the matches. This game is still pre-alpha, so don't expect this being the final product, because they have a whole set of ideas to add in this game. Such as, a realistic tactical co-op campaign that makes you feel like that you are an actual marines in space with your friends fighting land sharks and having a first contact with aliens.

								It doesn't seem like many people actually looked into the development of this game and what has happened to it. From what I've found/heard so far there are only a few people left working on it, but they are very dedicated and do what they can with the resources they have. The content in the game so far is pretty sparce, but the quality of it is wonderful. The sound design, movement system, and overall feel of the game is superb. I always check back every so often on the twitter page or the steam news page to see what progress is being made and keep my hopes up for the developer, a game such as the one that the Zero Point Software has in mind seems like it would be incredible to play, it'll just take time.

								The game looks amazing but...This game is a clear example how early access can be detrimental to its development. The state of the game hasn't changed much.It feels, by not having a deadline to publish or a push to get things done, has made the developers not care about a good replayable game and just hype it up to get more money.

								Updated 1/30/2015Keeps coming together every update. It is starting to have that excellent charm that I mention more so than before; and almost makes me feel like I am playing a spiritual successor to the old Rogue Spear series; which is great. In case you guys aren't as ancient as I am; Rogue Spear was a old Tactical FPS where you would go on missions to destroy, protect, survive, rescue, etc. This game shares some of those aspects with its more post-modern/sci-fi tactical style. I can't wait to see it grow more. The Starcrown Aerospace mission is a cool stealth-based one, which is demonstrating the versatility of the gameplay options. Right now it seems to focus on android murdering, but I would imagine in the near future they will start incorporating live missions where you are sent to fight real enemies. Also, I have notice some performance optimizations in the game.Original stuff:So far this game seems to be going in a great direction. The ambitious developers have been updating in good iterations and the background is looking very excellent. This game is essentially a Science-Fiction FPS where you are a Marine that goes to.. space! Common theme right? Well, this game does it different. You aren't some Halo Spartan or Warhammer Space Marine. You aren't some overpowered super-armored exo-suit marine that has access to giant guns and can punch enemies through a wall. You are a ordinary soldier who is trained for elite operations in space and ground. This game puts a nice emphasis on augmented reality technology, such as implementing a visor that indicates your objectives, ammo, used items, etc. This may compare to other Sci-fi Marine flicks, with the exception that it is in such a way where the technology IS apart of your helmet, and not some typical video game user interface. Take off the visor and you will notice there is nothing. No recticule, no ammo type, no indicators for equipment, no objective points, NOTHING. Just your gun and it's trustworthy Iron Sight. Right now as of Early Access, there are several features players can experience. While it isn't near to completion yet, it definately shows progress and I feel like these Developers are NOT out to dissapoint anyone. One thing I would like to see with this game is a little more of a team-based orientation when playing in competitive matches. It seems like no one really sticks as a team and it becomes a solo-festival of shooting. I don't have a big problem with it, but I have a problem if teamplay isn't encouraged.What really gets this game my thumbs up right now is the whole immersive experience. The Ambient sound effects while on board a space station with the lights out makes you feel like a real soldier sent to investigate a dead space station. The eerie sound of hostile robots and their locomotion has you glued to the iron sight to check all areas. The Helmet is on, the gun is loaded, the objectives are displayed and the flashlight is on. Ok, time to figure out how to proceed to the objective. This game just seems so much in that realm, and I would love it to continue being so. I just hope not all the levels are going to consist of pitch-black environments with 100% flashlight usage. The game should demand all sorts of scenarios. I do like the darkness, but I want a balance of dark and light. Missions in places where facilities have power and missions where places have no power and it is dark. Balance is everything when it comes to mission consistency.Things I expect and would like when the game goes gold:1. Peak performance optimizations2. Plentiful amount of multiplayer and singleplayer missions.3. Adherence to realistic player movement and team-oriented gameplay.4. Adherence to that immersive charm that I mentioned.5. Variety of equipment and weapons.I have a great amount of enthusiasm for this game. Keep up the good work!			"

								Pros:-Beautiful to look at (amazing lighting)-Challenging and competitive multiplayer-Unique ""Deadlock"" multiplayer mode-Pace of multiplayer games is just right-Well-designed maps-Dynamic weather/time-of-day creates constantly changing multiplayer conditions-New story-driven co-op gamemode vs AICons:-Limited number of servers to play on/not able to start your own server-Other things that are to be expected from an Early Access game, such as limited weapons/customization along with minor bugs/glitches here and there.Bottom Line:9/10... and we're only just getting started.ISM is probably the most well-polished Early Access game on Steam.  It is fully playable (and competitive) in its current state.  All current issues with the game are things any fair-minded gamer should expect from an Early Access game.  Limited number of servers is sure to change as game development progresses.  Looking at both what has already been added, along with the concept art of what Zero Point Software intends to add, is incredibly promising.  Gameplay is not quite as fast-paced as Call of Duty, but is not so slow that it prevents you from running-and-gunning when necessary.For some gameplay, check out my YouTube channel, ""Mobyus1"".

								I bought this game as an investment, hoping to both reap a reward from a sophisticated, finished piece of work when completed, as well as to support the dreamers behind it. Now, I play the game because I share the dream. Not only is the game becoming a fully-fledged FPS experience ( very  active developers with updates being released almost monthly), but the developers are finally making significant progress toward achieving their goal: realistic sci-fi FPS, in a truly tactical environment. A year ago, this could have been a rough demo. Now, it has grown into a ridiculously satisfying ball of tactical joy that I relish every time I capture a point. So,  for the love of the game , buy  Interstellar Marines  now!			"

								Game is very well done and atmospheric, but some parts of the gameplay are lacking (not enough content). I tried really hard to like the game but coop and solo mode are so short and the multiplayer is generic and boring (only one set of weapons). No doubt the game will be great upon leaving early access, assuming it ever will. This is the kind of game that made people despise early access, showing great potential but then stalling it for months or even years (this one is almost a decade old iirc).I'm not going to argue with anybody about the looks and feeling of the game as I quite enjoyed them, but the gameplay is lacking, especially for a game that has been in developpement for so long.(Playtime is during Free Weekend, and was plenty enough to try out every aspect of the game fully, believe it or not.)

If this game had fully populated 32vs32 deathmatch servers this game would be great.  Also it is a team work game that without decent teamwork becomes pain in the ♥♥♥.  Trying to extract from a mission while a noob is lost in the endless maze of corridors is kind of frustrating.  I just wish they would scrap the missions and go all pvp.  I think that would make the game sooo much fun.  For now I don't recommend it mainly due to the lack of community and the boring missions.			"

								Took the elevator during the tutorial and fell under the ground.Great way to start the game.Further on, I gave it another try and once again fell deep down the whole map, I think I've made my point.Aside from that I appreciate the detail and atmosphere brought to the NeuroGen mission but I'm definitely not convinced into buying the game in its current state, nor anytime soon as this game falls in the ""forever early alpha"" category.But wait I'm not done yet, not every map seem to function as expected, in particular NeuroGen which occasionally 'forgets' to spawn an item that is critical to the completion of the mission. Now that's a real shame because nevertheless, I'm gonna' have to admit it's one freakin' immersive mission which I really do like for its atmosphere... and it does not work! Did it even work once in the first place? I canot tell you.			"

								I was around the 700th person to get Interstellar Marines during summer time. I've waited quite a while for the developers to give the features that we were promised from the beginning (land sharks, co-op, etc) for about half a damn year. I thought they would add something to this game that would really just ""This is unlike any other game because of this idea"" and wow me. My god was I wrong. I have waited a long time to get my 15 dollars worth but all I get is this extremely clunky, limited, and coreless game that would pass for free as a browser game. The guns, or only gun, for that matter, flies upwards when you try your best to shoot forward making the simplest of shots nearly impossible. The maps are varied, but so dark, you can barely see anything you are shooting. There are no crosshairs, no crouching, no weapon variety, things that are standard of shooters. It is very difficult to find something good about this game at the moment unless you set your standards really low for this ""alpha"" title. I believed, but not anymore. THIS GAME STILL HAS 2 WEAPONS ITS BEEN 2 YEARS PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THAT.			"

Rank: 7.5/10Recommendation(s): Like team gameplay, know a thing or two about FPS shooters.Major Theme: Slow but coming along well.Bought at Price: $0.00 (Gift)I’ve always been a sucker for new first person shooters. As long as you don’t go overboard on the paid content, free to play titles interest me as well.Right from the start I was interested in Interstellar Marines. It wasn’t as if the small team was making yet another textbook example of an average FPS game. A lot of the mechanics are not commonly used in other games, and the environment is completely dynamic. Even the whole helmet idea seems “next-gen” (or whatever the marketing dept. is using these days).Running off Unity, the game does quite well in the graphics department. While it is still not completely optimized, most systems shouldn’t have issues running this game.

COOP was introduced not too long ago, and there are several player vs. player gamemodes on offer. With such as small team, it is going to take a while to get to the actual meat of the game – fighting mutant sharks and what have you. I’ve seen an update every month, or close to.

Personally I wouldn’t recommend this game to everyone, but to those willing to wait it out, I’m going to recommend the game even in its early access state. As long as you are willing to wait out the slow release cycle, you should in theory have a very nice game to play. Yes there are going to be bugs, I’ve experienced a few in my playtime thus far. I have found that any bugs get addressed in the next update, so I don’t worry too much.

								I don't believe anyone should really buy this game yet. So far it doesn't seem legit, they barley release any updates and when they do they are extreamly small. I bought this game thinking they were actually going to release game updates at least every week or so. Be careful when buying early access games, when they release wait a while and see if you hear good reviews about them. If so and you think the game is interesting then it is your choice to buy it, just make sure you know what early access means for a game. I hope Interstellar Marines gets to the point where it is a full game, but it does not look like it so far. They release updates every couple of weeks. The eight developers just don't seem as active as they should be for this early access game.(Edit) There are only eight devs, get that in your head.I say save your money for now. If you buy this game and you are bored of the concept after a little while, and don't see anything heading for it because of the developer's lack of updates for the game. I say you just wasted your money like I did.(Edit) I feel I wasted my money anyway.Be careful when buying early access games! I just want to make that clear!Thanks for reading!-Dildacorn(Edit)Read the comments!I get feedback from a dev!*Update* - I would ignore this thread, it is old and is not relevant to the new Intersteler Marines. Thanks for reading if you did, but this thread is completely wrong with the recent patches and updates they have put in the game.P.S. When this game is released I am sure it is going to be a great title for fps players! I give a thumbs down in the review, but when this game is fully released I will give this game a solid thumbs up! Thank you for reading.November 24, 2015From reading recent reviews this game still hasn't gotten the attention you would think it would have gotten in 3 years.. Just noting this in the post before you go buying a game that may take up to 10 years to finish.. OR MORE?January 10, 2017This game has gotten some good updates, and seems to have gotten more attention on missions for the game. It all still feels like simulation combat if that makes any sense, because if you have seen vidoes you will notice you are fighting robots and not any creatures yet. I think this game has deffinintly gotten better, but still needs a story. They are getting there! Hopefully the devs do not split up, because I heard rumors of it happening. If this game gets a story, someone please notify me!			"

								Its unfortunate to see such ignorance fom people buying early access games. Early access means incomplete, and that is the mentality that you must have when purchasing and helping the developers out with this game. As of now their updates have been focused on laying the groundwork for an interesting universe, and so far the game looks decent. The game feels smooth and all the character animations are fantastic. Allthough there isn't much to fight but other players and training bots (scary ones mind you), I feel the foundation that has been created has tremendous potential.			"

								Support this game! It's an enthusiast FPS developed by gamers for gamers and highly based on community feedback and input!It's still early in Alpha, so not too much of the planned features are in the game already, and progress is going very slowly. There is not even a hint of singleplayer campaign yet, but the multiplayer is progressing steadily. But even nw the early 16 player (!?) Multiplayer is intense and fun!			"

								The game has a lot of potential, but in this stage of early access, I cannot reccomend buying it.  There are only a small amount of servers with very little players.  Most maps are too open and the player models are too dark to see in most conditions unless they are moving right in front of your face.  The game is not optimized, as I have a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 (a very high end card) and the game barely achieves 60 fps when running at 4:3 resolutions (640 x 480) on low settings!			"

								Pretty shocking that this game has been released in its current state - please don't be misled by the description! Most features are currently in development. Even though the sidebar states ""Co-Op"", that doesn't even exist in its current iteration. The Single-Player stated is being able to walk around maps. That is all.I think the term ""Early Access"" and ""Alpha"" in this case are an understatement. The game has 1 gun. The game does not have the RPG elements. The game has only recently implemented jumping after months in development. Look at the features listed as being IN the game. A flashlight. A visor. A laser-sight. Is that really enough to justify selling this game to customers?Some might like your hardcore shooters. But please. There are better ones out there that aren't of the quality you'd find in a web browser.EDIT: A developer responded (check the comments). Although I understand the game is in Early Access, and I have bought many games under that term. But to release a game with a concept spanning years ago in still a pre-alpha stage with many features missing is just.. Well, wrong. Until the game massively overhauls and includes features that are game defining, what really makes this a ""good game""?			"

								Interstellar Marines for me is like Coca Cola is to fizzy drinks. It's a true benchmark of originality.Yes.... it's developement has been slow in terms of optimising and often I wished updates were fewer and the focus less on polishing and more on grabbing a wider audience in terms of game play quality.Having said that it is a testament to the quality of the game's foundations that give it a strong dedicated select following.The servers are less full now than they used to be which is a shame because it is the players themselves that contibute to the quality of the game. The game itself, in it's rawest form is capable of creating a community that others may not. With full servers this game is absolutely fantastic. Play it more is all I can say.			"

								Great concept and has a lot of potential, first thing is that It is not a finished game and is a little rusty but already is already pretty good.  I haven't played a lot due to the fact that i broke my pc and am currently building another. But the in the little time i got to play the game i still had a lot of fun.  So far in the game you are in a abandoned facility with humanoid robots that want to kill you.  You think that's like a lot of other games but the dark hall ways and the constant sound of foot steps always keeps you on the edge...List of things that are great...1. Great atmosphere, really sets the mood2. Playing Co-op is really fun3. A lot of cool features such as raising your helmet, turning on and off your light and laser.4. Scares the s**t out of you   In general good game with a lot of potential and thumbs up all the way :)			"

								NOTE: if you wish to see this review in its true form check out my blog: http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/03/game-reveiwinterstellar-marines.htmlIM Multiplayer is very fun and the Guns have that Battlefield realism to them. Most of the Maps are your standard shooter stuff, But one sticks out. ""Operations"" This map goes through three modes: Normal,Alarm, and Darkness. it makes the battles fun and exciting. during the Alarm mode it is hard to aim because of all the noise and flashing lights while in darkness you can not see without using your light, and if you do you will be giving your enemies a clear pointer to where you are.Although it is fun to play the lack of any choice when it comes to guns,armor, even your avatar's look, makes the game get old very fast. There is rarely more than one server with players on it, and sometimes when the server reaches 16 players you wont be allowed in with the game saying ""Error: Server is full"" even thought the limit says 18. Hopefully when the game progresses more there will be more players.  The game sells for $14.99 USD. Unless you get the Spearhead version in which you get all ""including all future updates and expansions"". i dont understand that really, ""All future updates?"" you get the updates no matter what version you have... right?Right now the game is very limited you can't crouch, go prone or do anything other than sprint and walk really. Leveling up does nothing other than giving you a steam achievement,  However the Dev road map promises that and more, including O-Rift support and Linux ports.The Devs seem to be staying on top of things with updates and bug fixes, and they obliviously have big plans for their game.if you want to invest in a small game that may one day become the PC's Halo then checkout Interstellar Marines from Zeropoint Software on Steam.

								This is reminicent of CoD, but with more focus on tactics and strategy. Although it is in alpha, it is a great game. Plus, it's not as expensive as it WILL be, and all updates are FREE when you buy. ZPS is doing a great job fixing as many bugs as they can in their timeline while also adding features at a pretty constant pace, and do an EXCELENT job of listening to the community.Current features include:        *Sprinting - Hold shift to sprint, and tap to toggle run on and off.        *Jumping - Press space to jump; Timing the release of the spacebar enables a slightly larger jump.        *Stamina - Sprinting and jumping reduces stamina.        *Crouching - reduces height of the model of the player and the hitbox.        *Sliding - While sprinting, hit the crouch button (Glitch - this feature currently breaks the hitbox of the player. To be fixed soon).        *Recoil - basic realistic recoil on weapons.        *Weapons: SMG - mid-short range 1.5(ish)x holo-sight. AR - long-mid range 2(ish)x scope.        *Revive - Press and hold <key> to revive a downed teammate (until the circle fills)[15 seconds after being downed players will ""bleed out""].        *Tutorial - Basic ""what to do to move, interact, and kill"" tutorial, and introduces Bots.        *Bots - AI controlled robots that can be set to different difficulties in the settings menu (I suggest Normal for beginners, and Realistic for those who are willing to die a few times)[TUTORIAL REDUCES ACTUAL DIFFICULTY].        *Two ""campaign"" missions - Neurogen Incident and Assault on Starcrown Aerospace        *Challlenge modes - Survival, Elimination, Nucleus Escape (map), Get Killed by Bots(single-player map).        *Online Multiplayer modes: Deadlock - Capture points to respawn teammates, final marine revives a teammate on a kill, first to eliminate enemy team or capture all points wins (Respawn timer - 120 seconds). Team Death Match - Kill the enemy team until time runs out. The team with most kills wins (Respawn Timer - 15 seconds). Team Domination - Control the point to remove tickets from the enemy team, first to reach zero tickets loses (Respawn Timer - 10 seconds). Free for All - Pretty dang self-explainatory (Respawn timer - 15 seconds).        *HARDCORE MODE - Hellweek : Servers of a max count of 64 players open once every few hours. Start out with a pistol with 15 rounds. Run around the 9 different maps collecting points, ammo, and guns, while avoiding/stalking/killing other players. Last 4 players have their points recorded to the global leaderboard. And, as is par with most hardcore games, NO RESPAWNS.        *Server lists: Multiplayer - AU, JP, USW, USC, USE, BZ, EU, RU servers, ping listed (ping is not accurate, just gives the ballpark with some exceptions). Coop - Same server regions as multiplayer, Includes both ""campaign"" missions, survival and elimination maps, and Nucleus escape (ping same as multiplayer server list)(There is an app on the steam forums that has accurate pings. Just search ""launcher"" in the discussions).			"

								do not buy this game!nothing substantial or meaningful has been added to this game since they launched on steam's alpha release program, OVER TWO YEARS AGO. everything the developers have promised up to now has been a lie. i can tell you right now there will never be a campaign and you will never see a live sharkman because they taunt their former customers with only dead ones. i think the developers of this game intend to be making money off your children long after you have forgotten this game. i don't believe they have any intention of ever completing this skeleton of a game.this game is a scam, a total scam and nothing but...the developers of this game are the biggest criminals on steam! they are bad people.understand that the developers do delete every single negative comment from their forums and they ban every user who isn't there to congratulate them on becoming millionaires for producing a perpetually unfinished product!two years in early access and they are no closer to being finished today than when they started because each of the twenty-two updates they have made have been in the tiniest increments imaginagble and after two years they have only managed to bring forth the most basic framework of a game.remember that if you're dumb enough to pay the man.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------and yes, i do see that they made another microscopic bs update to the game the day after i made this review, completely by coincidence.of course if you read the extensive changelog closely, you quickly realize that the changelog is padded with about ten reiterations of the same simple feature of ""inviting friends to your game"".i tested this bs update on another account. no improvements have been made. this so-called game is still a tech demo with graphics comparable to doom 3 in terms of visual quality yet the graphics still lag at 1080p inexplicably on powerful desktop pc's. a restrictive, locked fov, (estimated 70 degrees) that will make you puke after fifteen minutes on a 16:9 monitor. two guns that behave identically, both just throw bullets all over the place and they both point to the sky with recoil if you try to empty a magazine and something that might possibly be a shotgun, (really can't tell what it is) sounds like those finger-snaps that you throw against a hard surface and they pop. oh, and the same pathetic AI, reminiscent of Takedown: Red Sabre. also the same ridiculous anti-jumping mechanic that will make you want to reach out and strangle the cognitively impaired person who came up with the idea. this game has been billed as co-op from the start and here we are two years later with a standard deathmatch and no real co-op mode to speak of unless you just like shooting the dumb AI with another person on all the current test maps without any kind of continuity because it's not a campaign although they pretend it is and no cooperative mechanics nor objective other than shoot the pitiful robots that you can often find wandering off by themselves because they lose track of the player.the only people who speak favorably of this game are paid shills and/or gullible children who follow anyone who is willing to lead them.this review is not subject to debate. if you have an opinion to the contrary, keep it to yourself because I am telling it like it is and you know it.

								Before you buy this game please consider THEIR mistakes first:- Game concept is from 2005!!!!!!

Yay!) - Game is 8 months old with lack of proper stuffYou think that's it? You're wrong. This game was first time introduced on steam 2nd July 2013 (currently we have 6th Febuary) and still has same issues that was on the beginning. No crouch. No sharks. Empty maps. A lot of ""fake"" advertisement Multiplayer is nothing than Team Deathmatch with ONE gun.Believe me, It's not worth your time or even your cash.This game will simply die after few next months.			"

								Interstellar Marines, post update 12: The game is in early access on Steam and the most predominant game mode is a multiplayer variation of take and hold terrain. There are several servers available, and it is of course best to chooze the one with the lowest ping. Despite intermittent lag problems the game is very intense and immersive. The graphics are well done and the play between light and shadow is fantastic. Best of all is the audio though, which really adds to the immersion. The teams consists of up to 8 players each, with usually quite varying skill and experience levels. The game is quite hard for all beginners, and can feel quite hopeless when starting as a fresh TR-0. But if you don't give  up, and maybe enjoy a little masochism, you will improve and start to dish it out yourself. Before you  know it (well... hundred hours or more later) you reach top level TR-100. Then it's your turn to dominate the fresh meat pouring in!			"

								Note: this game is pre-alpha in time of review. Edited it to update some content that's in the game as of 6/3/15.Interstellar Marines is a game I've been following since 2008, it has been redone into the Unity engine and is constantly being updated. The community is fantastic, the dev team is really nice, and it is a overall positive environment. The game has a fun multiplayer component, an awesome lighting system, and has good balancing. The game also have a decent amount of maps that can change as the match progresses mostly by lighting, the atmosphere is very impressive and one of the best in MP FPS games. The game now has COOP with several modes in the game. The Terrorist Hunt-like mode Elimination, the Objective-based Survival, and Nucleus-exclusive Escape. There's also two Campaign maps (The Neurogen Incident and Assault on Starcrown Aerospace) including a tutorial for the game.The bad: The game has only has two weapons, the framerate isn't that great unless you have a good processor, and content is bare bones. If you expect a lot of stuff in this early version, you'll be disappointed. However, the game is decent enough to sink a lot of hours into it, and the community is remarkable. I would recommend buying it now, mainly for that and for future content.			"

								because... laser party! ...It not finished, not polished, doesn't has a perk system or customization options. But still has the best multiplayer there, on its current state, the game is better than others out there. The co-op mode is awesome, totally tactic, move like a real team, covering the rearguard, taking care each other... And you will be scared. Trust me in here. There are seven co-op maps for now (2 coop campaign levels and 5 coop challenge levels) but you don't need more. The single player is more of the same, tactic, unforgiven, hard... You feel even more fear... cause you will be alone. There is now Hell Week, a pvp and pve online mode, with the style of the Hunger Games, you need survive, finding ammo, weapons, making team with other players (or being a lone wolf)... in a changing environment, a really hard mode, doesn't forgive a mistake.You need to play as a team, understand the battlefield, think each move, do not rush. You can feel the stress of a battle, the pressure, the fear. It's realistic and raw. The changing environment, fighting in dynamic places, you can see around you and suddenly complete darkness (literally). Accesses that appear and disappear, rain, snow, changing ground level...The game has a incredible sound system, you can hear the steps of an enemy and anticipate to its movement, hear it while reloading its gun behind a corner, hear it running on the floor above you... The wind hitting your helmet, the rain dropping on it... The best treatment of the sound, outstanding.There are people who criticize the game, but they don't understand that without their support is very difficult to continue development the game...The devs need all our support, because the game is made entirely independent and with passion, and money doesn't grow on trees ya know. So do not listen to those negative votes, because the game is incredible, the best. Buy the game, then buy another copy to your friends and repeat, because that money is the one producing the game, and with our support the game will become an indie AAA game.The best community that can be found it's in here. The best. What a community! I dare you, I double dare you, to find such a committed, friendly, dedicated and awesome community. We all know each other.The best developers are here, involved with the community. There is even a competitive environment already, with clans and tournaments.We don't play Interstellars Marines, we live it, because those who really see beyond this game, love it, because all of this is  FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME.

Early Access Review
								Great game, great concept!Interstellar sports only half a dozen levels but as an early access game it is understandable. At this point there are two single player missions (up to 4 players can complete them), a couple of levels for a team of 4 players (designated as coop missions) and some more stages for those eager to play with even more players (multiplayer missions).When not playing against each other you play against robots. With the submachine gun they handle they look like T-800s straight out of the Terminator franchise. Some prefer melee to shooting - on greater difficulties it is easier to die but your friends can revive you.Level design is excellent and the environment changes constantly: changes in the weather affect visibility; suddenly it is nighttime and only your flashlight helps you but then it also reveals your position. At night light poles can aid you or if it is raining the sudden lightning can help you to eliminate your foes.Interestingly, you only have two rifles available. One is intended to help you with targets in greater distance; both can be equipped with a suppressor and laser sight. At this point they serve their purpose but perhaps a melee weapon could be nice.As for graphics: the good old Unity engine delivers. Lighting effects are great - with the quick steps of the approaching robots you are in for a treat due to the excellent atmosphere. In fact, the single player mission revolving around an accident can certainly give you the creeps!Interstellar proves we have to look out for independent video game developers! I am happy to recommend this game - especially now (February 11th, 2015) when it is free to play till next week.			"

								Listen I bought this game in a long time ago. No I don't have 800 hours playing it but I don't need that many to see that the Devs have lost their original sight for this game. The initial video they put out laid out a basic ""train of thought"" and that was that they wanted to create a Tactical FPS based on their past experiences in games like RB6. The said they wanted it to be a slow methodical FPS in space. Now with that being said, I saw them completely turn from that to a RnG style shooter which other than the polish, differs in no way shape or form from CoD, CS or any other number of titles. I loved the vision and I loved the Idea but I also sort of knew that this would happen because It's a small niche to work in. Soooo many people play ADD/ADHD style games these days. It's hard to fathom that people who actually like slow, methodical, deliberate movements, tactical pausing and even a bit of camping for survival sake, bleed damage one or two shot kills and team survival style play only nume in the single digit percentile of FPS players today. Sooo It's easy to see how a smaller company can lose sight of its intentions and jump into the race that they were trying to avoid in the first place. It doesn't make it any easier for a player such as me who was hoping that they wouldn't but hey, we live and learn.			"

Early Access Review
								Update 1/14/15 - Still pick this up from time to time trying to get into it.  I'm glad to see that they are finally releasing content more readily - almost want to change to a positive review just for that.  However, I still stick by most of the thoughts from the original review.  This game is still only a game ""with potential"" - currently 2 guns and a handful single/multiplayer maps large aspects of the game that is promised are missing and those are the elements that will really set this game apart from a standard FPS.  On a positive note the game LOOKS and sounds amazing and I like that I can see some of the elements starting to come into play such as ranks.  Also I feel a lot better about the state of the game since I have seen updates much more steadily.  Sadly, RIGHT NOW this game feels very shallow and offers nothing unique.  I'm not trying to knock the game too much in early access but I'm just warning for people that a lot of the core elements outline for what this game is meant to be don't seem to be coming in the near future.  I look forward to the day when this game offers something that really grabs me and brings me because I really want to like it, the game just can't hold me for more than 10-20 minutes per session because it feels so flat and uninspired.---Game development is just taking far too long.  It seems that the focus has been big time on graphics and little else.  So if they can apply the level of quality in their lighting effects to ANYTHING else in the game at some point it has a lot of promise, but after a few years I just don't see it coming.  It feels like a blizzard game, lot of time put into something that in the end is ""Okay"" and you're left wondering why it took so long for THAT.There are a lot of game elements missing and I'm not exactly sure why.  Right now you are greeted the same basic things you can find in standard dev kits.  The pure lack of simple features after years of development leads me to believe that this is taking a back burner to something else.  You should be alarmed that they make a big deal about adding in basic things and it just makes me fear how long it will take to implement all that they are setting out to implement (non-linear play, RPG-style character growth, Story) when they can't even implent sprint or a few weapons after years of development.Just grab it when it comes out (if ever) or when it gets closer to completion, you won't be missing anything.  They take so long to do anything the ""future expansions"" you're guranteed with preorder will probably never exist or will take so long you'll have moved on to something else.			"

								Sorry Zero Point Software guys, I really hope I'm wrong here and I'd love to buy/play the finished game. So best of luck!Gave it a shot as it's free for a week which is a nice gesture from the developers. I'm afraid I'm not hugely impressed in it's current playable state particulary after reading the history of the developement which spans a number of years and this is the result. You can certainly see the potential building blocks of a decent game and it promises some ambitious features  (90% of these aren't in the game yet) but ultimately it's a forgettable gaming experience right now and one must assume being developed partime due to the slow updates. I'd probably be a bit more forgiving if there were some especially original elements in this early version that gave it a wow factor of things to come. There aren't, and remains just a list of awesome ideas/plans. In it's current state the level designs feel quite average and lacks any convincing sense of impact when you shoot the enemy. Nothing in the game right now resembles anything that it promises, and that's a bit worrying. I'm not sure the developers have the ability to create that game.  I have a real bad feeling this is going to be a game that's never going to be fully completed and the current heavily discounted price drop and extended free play is a cash grab from the developers in final effort to raise some quick cash to continue the development work. I doubt it will raise the money they need so I'm not going to invest even the paltry sum of under a fiver that's currently available for. As we know Early Access can be a gamble but you sometimes get a vibe if it's worth taking the gamble, and I'm thinking not in this case.			"

								worst pruchase ever made. It went on about 8 months ago with a promising piece of PR Art that sugested a faily advanced point of development and actual skill. What got me was the promise: get it now, it will never be that cheap again. None of this was real and it went 66 % off twice. Some of the devs or friends of em are even giving away free copys. Though in EARLY development nothing that is not trivial like a new slider in the options menu developed over the course of about 8 months. HANDS OFF! till they get a finished Product done...  THERE ARE NO SPACE SHARKS.... 3 (now 5) ""maps"" mp shooter  with precise aiming... no cover system... no tactic elements no nothing... oh.. you can open your helmet... does the sound still get wonky if you do that?... a TECH DEMO at BEST... I feel like I supported lazyness and a big a** office.... Steam is a market place, no kickstarter campaign. I wanna buy games, not potential.To the Dev response:Maybe, they should not accuse people of not getting the early access concept. That's flat out offensive AND shaming, when the results clearly show WHO's not getting it! Since the release of Natural Selection 2 for instance UnknownWorldsEntertainment (5 people) released several updates a week (later less frequently ""only"" thrice a month) for free. Serious contend and balance updates with all new features, Engine performance workovers, models, animations and Maps tewaks. Till only one year later the game was finished and had changed its face several times for the good and had 2 completley free expansion Packs. And you wanna tell me your skill and know how can compete with that? Please stop the hair splitting and convincing of dumb people!.. we are NOT!And where did all the money go? Do you need all of it to implement a points system worth mabye 50 lines of code? Did you hire people who actually are up to it. Cuz' lets face it you worked out an engine. There are NO gameplay elements exept for the Doom 2 MP..... YET...... sure.. insert random promise here.TILL YOU GET IT RIGHT.... I didn't want to be that harsh, but taking peoples money and don't deliver for ages is a di** move. Tell you what. You can refund me and when the game is finished I will buy it AND take everything back... I promise!PS: I should compare the PR work with the actual game on youTube. Cuz' though there are no actual lies in the Trailers, they suggest pretty darn hard things that are not there.			"

Early Access Review
								So far, from what I've played of Interstellar Marines, I have to say I'm not 100% impressed. While I'm aware it's a game in Alpha development the problems which are presented are fundemental things, mechanics and such, which maybe the developers will see from this review.Let's get the ball rolling!First off the bat, there are only three weapons available at present, which to be frank isn't what you'd expect from a future combat simulator. All guns feel pretty much the same the only thing that really differs is one is single shot, one has a scope but less rounds and one has more rounds and is your all round most used gun. Gun sounds are alright, but again there doesn't seem to be  much difference between all of them. The laser sight is a bit weird on all of them, helps a little when shooting from the hip, but if your shooting from the hip you aint gonna hit much anyway. For some reason when you shine the lasersight at plants it acts like a flashlight on the plant as well which is equally as wierd. Maps are, at best... generic, no real detail, lots of spamming of textures, think planetside two but on a reasonable quality that the normal man can run on his PC. Buildings have collision flaws, so you can look into the world at points, where as at others you cant shoot round a corner because an invisible bit of wall is blocking you leaving floating bullet holes. The lighting system is really quite awful, sometimes you can shoo a light out in one shot, some times in three clips, it depends on how stroppy the light is. All lights seem to go through walls which is really bad considering we're no longer in 2005, and when a ligh in a bathroom is seeping out onto the outside decking that's just not cool.Most of your time will be in Single player as for some reason or another I still can't access multiplayer, servers won't refresh, which either suggests a bug or that no servers are up which is a bad thing seeing as the game is being sold as co-op and multiplayer. Single player is pretty dull for the most part, you're AI guide's voice is generic robot and just gives you a headache after a while, it also tries to crack some sarcastic jokes which doesn't make any sense as the rest of the time it's trying to be serious, Sometimes there are also some random adjectives thrown into it's vocalbulary because why not.Most missions are training missions, the one's that actually seem like real assignments are also training missions, but the descrptions don't include that, and you'll be fighting one of two bot variants, one's with guns and flailing shop dummys. One mission can't be completed because the elevator at the end kills the player, and on the same mission they throw in some audio logs which are about the most immersing thing into the universe and even they seem a bit strained.The Robot AI is some sort of horrible combination of skyrim's stealth detection and Deus Ex's: Invisible war. In short terrible. You're given which difficulties you'd like from easy, normal, hard, and ""relaistic"" (Which just means more bots, who can one shot you with some sort of taser you don't seem to be allowed to use). The stealth system is a fraud, you can shoot lights out and hide in the shadows, but this just means it takes bots a few seconds longer to see you, if you shoot a bot even with one of the weapons silencers from some 100 metres away another bot will spawn, will run or walk to where the other one was, find you and kill you. f you don't of course plug him full of some lead. I basically have mastered speed running the maps, you can use stealth or you can just memorise what spawns where, and go in full guns blazing, which works pretty succesfully if you don't panick.In short. 5/10 currently, with improvements could push a 6-8/10 depending on if they start working on new enemy models, multiplayer that works (I've seen none of it) more weapons, grenades, better stealh, lighting and more varied maps and by that I mean maps where metalic grey isn't the colour of every man made surface. Buy it at your own risk, I wouldn't personally reccomend it currently, I think it would have been a better option to release this fully devloped, because personally I coulda waited for the actual release. But hey maybe the devs will turn it around, I'm aware it's meant to be artificial environments and a training simulator but I've seen laser tag places cooler than this.I think I'll edit this in a year's time or so and see if anything changes.

It's still in early access of course, so there are only a few maps and game modes, along with a few bugs, but features are constantly being added. Oh, and they will be adding a single player campaign, which I haven't seen in a long time in FPS games on Steam (Apart from COD and Battlefield, but they're too mainstream. #HIPSTER4LIFE).			"

								Okay. So. I played this game. Blasted through a couple of single player missions, cried my way through some Co-op missions due to the lack of stealth ability and it just became a co-op run and gun, then raged my way through multiplayer when i realised i was playing a mix between a CoD (spray and pray) AvP2 (excessive use of darkness) Battlefield (Conquest like map) mash up. Quite frankly. Alpha or not. unless they DRASTICALLY change this game. It's horrible. The movement feels like your on ice all the time, Frame rates are all over the shop 20ish-150, the whole game feels washed out due to lack of colour or too much of the same colour. all in all i don't know why this game is so special. IMO it's not worth the money it's asking for. Alpha/beta or otherwise. I doubt the roots of a game can change. I leave this review utterly disappointed. I couldn't even bring myself to play more than an hour of this game...			"

								WARNING: EARLY ACCESS AT TIME OF REVIEWAt the time of this review, the game is currently in Early Access and is missing a lot of core features like multiple weapons and attachments, Co-op and the immersive story campaign.Interstellar Marines is a Sci-fi Tactical FPS set in a believable future. In early access you take on the role of a special forces soldier training at an underground interplanetary treaty organization (ITO) Facility. The game is currently centered around multiplayer. Where you as the special forces soldier train in a variety of specialized environments. All multiplayer maps feature a unique set of dynamic lighting and elements which really set this game apart from other FPS. The level and map design is ""AAA"" quality, the level designs allow multiple entry ways into most access points and areas allowing for Tactical game-play, and greatly rewarding players who are able to effectively communicate. The game features a distinctive active HUD, which when shot can be disabled adding another level of immersion into the world.For a game that is in early access, it is incredibly polished, with very few bugs and glitches. The game has a very active community. The community Managers are online, on the forums daily, and will even stop by from time to time to play a round with you.Overall I highly recommend this game anyone who enjoys FPS. It is exceptionally well made for a game in early access, fun, and has a great community to be a part of. The game is getting better, and better with every update, and continues to become more tactical and immersive every patch.			"

								A fun little time-waster at best. As of 4/1/14, the game itself is missing quite a few core mechanics that in my opinion really define the term ""First Person Shooter"", which are included but not limited to: more weapons, more game modes, more team-oriented play, more use of an interface, etc.There are currently two game modes, being multiplayer and training. The multiplayer leaves much more to be desired, and unfortunately limits the player to only one class, and one weapon being an SMG; which has to be your close-quarters weapon, sniper rifle, assualt rifle, and secondary weapon. The only way to ""rank-up"" and I use this term lightly here, is to kill openents by shooting them in the head (as body shots do not count towards the enemy being hit); which makes me much rather just want to play Halo's SWAT game mode. Even though the objective of the game is to get your openents ticket count to zero by dominating a controlled area; this can be done much more quickly by just killing openents (and is a lot more lucrative too, seeing as how dominating the control area doesn't help you ""rank up"" at all).There are a few cool mechanics such as the ever changing environments; and the abillity to shoot out lights in the area forcing your openents to fight in the dark; which could either help or hurt you depending in the situation. Overall, it just makes me want more out of it; but it's definitely worth keeping an eye on, as there is major potential.			"

								Forget about this. Nothing the trailer or description promises is actually in the game. I get that this is early access, thus an alpha, but alpha state means the basics are basically implemented albeit in an unpolished and buggy state.You can't promise a ""4 player co-op tactical FPS"" inspired by Rainbow Six, when all you get is 8 servers with random team deathmatch, featuring gameplay that would be archaic even by the standards we had 10 years ago.If you buy this now, this is what you get:A space marine with sluggish controls (you walk very slow, sprint barely changes speed) ONE weapon and useless features like being able to open your helmet. Multiplayer consists of very basic team deathmatch (good luck finding a non-full server though, there's only 8 of them) that feels very uncomfortable due to the aforementioned controls, which are so archaic, especially for a supposedly ""tactical FPS"", that it feels like a joke. Quake did control better than this. Seriously, after multiple updates you are now able to jump (meaning, you press space and then akwardly hop a little bit, after a short delay). What's more, you can't lean to the left/right to peek around corners and you're unable to crouch. In a tactical FPS. It's ridiculous.And don't talk to me about ""it's early access, bla, bla"", we're talking about basic, most fundamental things missing that really undermines my trust i have in the developer.Other critics meantioned the fair and balanced maps and online gameplay. Seriously? I just joined a server in which i killed ONE dude and then subsequently got killed as soon as i spawned. The top player in my team? 43 kills. The top players of the enemy team? 389 and 346 kills respectively.Don't buy it, it's not worth 5 bucks (it's on sale right now) and i'm very doubtful now that this will ever be something akin to a finished game (another critic mentioned that this game is in development since 2009).

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!! IT IS A RIP-OFF AT ANY PRICE!!there is still nothing to this game as of 10-01-2015.also i want to preface this with the fact that the graphics are literally on the level of Doom 3.the fov is fixed and narrow enough to make anybody sick, i was nauseated after less than 15 minutes.and the so called ai are about the most pathetic i have seen since Takedown: Red Sabre.the developers have stated that they do not plan to finish the single player campaign for another five years.the programmers at zero point software intend to become old men while they work on this game but i don't intend to play it when i'm old so buying it was a waste of my money that helped make them millionaires for doing nothing. i don't give a ♥♥♥♥ if future generations play this game when they are born, i wanted to play this game in my lifetime and that is why i gave them money a year ago but i have yet to receive anything in return for it.it took them nine months to add the most pitiful crouch we've seen in a game. it's as though they just rushed the changes through this week so they could advertise it for the current sale.those videos and screenshots look so nice. don't they? the game must be good, right? the problem is, that's all there is to see, most of them are only concept videos and not the real game. they make it look like there is a game to play in the video but it's all fake, there is no gameplay to speak of.look at it closely, what do they actually show of gameplay footage? two guys getting shot, the in-game footage in the video amounts to about four seconds out of a minute and a half of video and you really can't see what's going on in that video, no matter how closely you study it.there is still nothing to this game, the movement and shooting are terrible. each of the arenas is just a big square room with nowhere to go and of course there is also terrible network lag and the most recent update has introduced an incredible drop in framerate, it's like a ♥♥♥♥ing bad dream. and in case you think i have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pc, i'm running an 8350fx on a crosshair V formula z w/32gb and an r9 290x.also they are no closer to a campaign and coop today than they were when the game came on steam almost a year ago. READ THE AD CLOSELY, NOTHING THEY ARE SELLING IS IN THE GAME YET AND WHEN QUESTIONED DIRECTLY, THEIR ESTIMATED TIME FRAME FOR ANY OF IT IS AT LEAST A YEAR AWAY!!you are going to be sorry that you spent your money, if you buy this game, i promise you this.if you are wondering if this game is a scam or not, an owner of the actual product is telling you that it is.now you can't say no one tried to warn you.it's a shame that confidence scammers like these men are allowed to become millionaires overnight for doing nothing more than bringing perpetually unfinished software to steam.

Early Access Review
								I followed this game before release on Steam and picked it up on the Day 1 release.Interstellar Marines is a great game and I would recommend it if you would like to support the devs though the process of making the game.  I don't usually write reviews, but this is one of the few games that I think has warranted a review.  Interstellar Marines is a great concept and widely fun.  I know this because I have convinced 8 people to buy it and they all love it.  The devs while struggling through tough times have managed to keep this game alive for many years and while progress is slow, i'm sure the end result will be worth it.  This will be a coop game with multiplayer integrated in with it.  ZPS decided to first start with the player mechanics, so multiplayer was the first thing being developed.  While there are not a lot of people on it, you can still get games going and i've had fun in the Wargames mode known as hell week and have actually gotten into quite a few good firefights.  While the game is barebones as of now, I believe there will be major progress once this game gets a publisher.  I have the patience to wait and love the game and want to see something truely capture the feeling of a sci-fi first contact scenario.Things I like about the game:-The weapon play(Even with only 3 weapons being available)-Art and character design-AI that is actually scary and dangerous-Unique Multiplayer with the C.E.R.A. weather and lighting AI.-Robots -The few Co-op previews on the game are fun. (Even better when you play them with friends)-Hellweek (It's interesting and a very unique gamemode)And now for the one negative:-Lack of content (This is understandable though because of the current state of the dev team and lack of a publisher)I still believe in this game.

								I'm confused.The atmosphere of this game provides some level of stealth, some level of close-encounters jump scares due to the general darkness which seems to haunt every single level in this game. But that's pretty much it.I'm confused. What's special about this game?Interstellar Marines seem to be doing the exact same thing any other FPS on the market does, only with the exclusion of any natural light sources. That's pretty much it. Every map is dark, and you walk up to someone and shoot them in the face while spraying.Is this the selling point? Dark maps? That's it? Seriously, I'm lost.Before any of ye wail : ""But it's just in alpha!! Give it some time!""From what I experienced, the game seems to have its gameplay in order, its roots can hardly change any more than Evolve could've changed while it was in ""Alpha"". All it lacks is some additional content -- but all it means is that what you're looking at is Counter Strike with some extra flavor, or even a Call of Duty in perpetual darkness with no other selling point. Interstellar Marines, as much as I experienced -- is your generic shooter....In space. That's it.Update:Other than my disbelief that there's any actual gameplay (spray-and-pray), I find the free week long trial to be a marketting blunder, who thought a ""pre-alpha"" game is a good demo? Heck, even when stepping into the tutorial of the game, it never does anything to tell you how Interstellar Marines is in any shape or form unique or interesting. You walk around, you shoot stuff for no reason, the end. I was informed they essentially want to create a form of a Rainbow-Six tactical-shooter, but when you finish the tutorial, or when you even finish a multiplayer session....You get absolutely 0% Rainbow 6. You are only welcomed by a ""The Swapper"" atmosphere, which is pleasant, and, sadly, some mindless bot killing. You do nothing but blindly walk around in a poorly lit series of rooms, and spray anyone you can see.That's it.The game, upfront, tells you its current vision : ""Nothing"".I don't buy the ""pre-alpha"" monotony, the game's design is too polished, too satisfying. They clearly thought that'd gain them more sales if the game was an eye-candy, but sadly -- they neglected how the game works, how the game plays out -- and currently, and most likely for the very distant future -- it will not be anything like Rainbow-Six in space. I cannot be anything but cynical regarding the development of this game. If they do manage to pull their vision off, whatever it is, good for them, really. But I fear that might be some time in 2018.TLDR: The CORE OF THE GAME does not exist. Whatever it is they have envisioned, it does not currently exist. After 2-3 years, they have nothing to show for. What were they doing all that time? They sure boast their dynamic-lightning system, but where's the actual game?I seriously think someone up on advertising and marketting thought he was being clever for coming up with this week-long thing, what a rubbish idea. It only demotivated me from buying this game. For shame.			"

								Interstellar Marines is a very ambitious project. It has a lot of potential but has been held back by financial problems from the credit crunch and the loss of a major investor. They had to start all over again with a new engine. This is why it's taken this long to get this far.What is available right now is bare bones stuff. We have a simple multiplayer game with not much else. The devs don't want to waste time putting things in to the game for the sake of it which then have to be changed further down the line. We have no crouch, lean or even any extra weapons...YET, and that is the key word. All of these things will be implemented in time and from what I've seen of the updates, implemented in a brilliant way.The game as it is now is very well polished, looks, sounds and 'feels' great and will only get better, (and more expensive), as more stuff gets added.I'm very excited by Interstellar Marines as I reckon it's going to be amazing once finished, if you buy now then you do need to realise it's in PRE-ALPHA, so there isn't a great amount of content right now, but even so, the multiplayer is a tense and exciting affair, not to mention a lot of fun, and the level design is magnificent.Pick this game up and it's unlikely, in time, you'll be dissapointed.For the love of the game!

								Interstellar Marines is an ambitious project by an enthusiastic team. The concept is pretty fresh; think Rainbow Six, System Shock 2 and Half Life in a blender. The dev team is small, but growing. It is in early access currently so it is in a pre alpha state. It is limited to VERY simple mechanics and multiplayer at the moment, but is updated and improved upon on a regular basis. The team plans on implementing all those fps basics and more in the near future. In all honesty I've had more fun with this than any other complete and big budget multiplayer fps. I have had a blast so far playin in the community gatherings and interacting with the ZPS guys.They are patient, friendly and listen to fan feedback. They genuinely want to make an amazing game. The potential is limitless if they keep getting the support they deserve. It is wise to jump in while you can get it for such a decent price. The community alone is worth the price tag. Good things come to those that wait.			"

								While it is in early access, and the quality of early access steam games is less than reputable, this game's developers have again and again continued to update and fix this game making it the best it could become and will continue to do so into the future. Since I purchased the game in 2013 they have made tremendous leaps and bound in it's development. Buy the game now while it's cheap and give the devs some well earned funds so that you dont have to buy it later when all your friends are raving about it and the game is higher priced.			"

Early Access Review
								Ahh Interstellar Marines, how far you have fallen. You were destined for great things; great gameplay aesthetic, an interesting and mysterious but genuinely intriguing premises, and ultimately some legitimately engaging multiplayer.Interstellar Marines was a game I purchased a few years back after initially being drawn in by their comedic, if not very informative Kickstarter. We were given great hopes of a new title that would make potentially groundbreaking steps in the FPS industry, with things like a dynamic hud system, a true to form presence of character, an in depth and highly customisable cosmetic system, and a focus and direction akin to older titles such as Half Life and System Shock. What did we get? Well, that's not the right question, for the game is STILL in Early Access Hell. The correct question would be, what have we gotten so far?So far really, we've got a few single player missions, some of which are simply rehashed MP maps with bots added. A rather patchy Multiplayer system at best, sporting a desirable amount of servers but a spotty population.A 'Hunger Games' style mode that is still a long way off being even remotely polished.3 functional weapons out of a probable array of at least 10+, one of which STILL only has a stockholder model.A competent customisation system that uses points earned in game as currency, with quite a vast selection of different skins for both guns, and armour alike. A deep and rich soundstage, with some very nice atmospheric and moody tones. An able yet perhaps archaic game engine that provides great lighting tech with some admirable game detail.A genuine and enthusiastic developer, with great character and diehard commitment. A luscious and vibrant soundtrack, despite being Early Access there are some beatiful pieces here.So why do I not recommend this game? A few factors, to be breif. The development team has completely died off. Only one man remains and he requires help from those in the community with skill in the required arts.The updates died down drastically, and almost all of them were focused on multiplayer exclusively; not a great impression to make when you boldly state that the game will sport a fully fledged campaign.And the overall direction the game has gone in regards to the roadmap and promises made by the devs.I will never regret making this purchase, let me emphasise this. But I cannot help but feel that I will never live to see this game finished in my lifetime. Between having the developers completely abandon ship, leaving it to the sole devotion of only one of the founders, and the almost obsessive nature of adding content to Hell Week/War Games whatever without stimulating the other areas of the game, the game is simply dying off. For an eternity we pleaded for more single player content, bug fixes, player features, and weapons, only for the devs to focus on the multiplayer component. This game simply put, in its current state, will either never finish, or will come to fruition long past the time it would be relevant and fresh. The problem is that for this game to continue, it needs funding, but no one wants to fund a game that has been in Early Access for soooo looong. I wish this game all the best, and I wish I could support the only developer to the best of my capability, but the constant let downs with a seemingly (prior to abandonment) deaf dev team, only aid in pushing this game further into its own demise.Overall verdict: What the game has so far is solid, if not all the puzzle pieces required. Understand however that your contribution may not yield immediate results. There is a great concept here, but the sheer ambition of this game has been its downfall.PURCHASE THIS GAME AT YOUR OWN RISK!			"

								Quick review.Stealth in this game sucks. No matter if you're sitting under the lamp, or in the deepest pitch black, those ♥♥♥♥ing robots still see you, and snipe you from across the map. Also, almost everything here happens under the veil of night, yet your ♥♥♥♥ing future soldier doesn't seem to have a nightvision. Cool. Also, it works really weird. With my i5 and 8 gibs of ram, I can barely take 30 fps out of it. Also no graphic settings. I lowered my resolution, and turned the shadows to low. That's all you can do.I mean it's not all bad. Animations are cool, graphics too. They're trying, but they're trying for a really long time now.			"

								It's the best Indie FPS I've ever seen! It has some performance issues, hopefully Unity will make it runs smoother, but it's a really good game. In this state it hasn't much to offer, but the developers are working on the game all day and night. It has a very good feature, which I've never seen before, you can make a trip on the maps, and test some lighting effects, and enviroment types. It's a pretty cool feature, but like DayZ it hasn't much to offer. You can play multiplayer, which is crazy good: No name tags, no minimap, and team kill is ON! IF you want to take a look at the gameplay elements head over interstellarmarines.com/game, and try out 2 prototypes for FREE! You just have to register an account and play. It's the only Single Player mode in the whole game, but the game doesn't contains them. Anyway: Interstellar Marines is a good game, but if you want a full game ( or doesn't understand what Early Access means ), then don't buy it yet. But if you'd like an old school multiplayer shooter, with an amazing atmosphere, THEN Interstellar Marines is your game!			"

								The Game isn't really finished. The multiplayer was pretty dead during their big ""Hell Week"" event so I guess it would be even worse any other time. The game is DARK as well. Arma can get pretty dark at night but this game get absolutely pitch black, no light coming off of the screen. The single player AI doesnt need light though, because combat drones can smell you through walls apparently. The singleplayer is a nightmare to play, combat drones spot you instantly regardless of crouch, flashligh, or laser. and they hit every single shot, most times I got detected I died immediately as soon as I rounded a corner that was black as night. Really need to work on that stealth mechanic, but I dont think that was put it yet. Do not reccomend in this state at all.			"

								Interstellar Marines is a tactical FPS published in 2013. It's still in early acces... (you probably know what I'm talking about).The Devs seem motivated and active (regular updates) but the game is going anywhere, it feels like nothing has changed in the two years I own the game already. Any other Dev would have already abandoned this, and for a reason. Their idea of creating a AAA-Indie failed obviously. They overdid themselves, and they are still beating this dead horse. It's sad to see what happened to their idea, and how they are using a lot of energy towards this.To come to the things I like about the game:-Active devs-Decent community (not too friendly, not to toxic either)-Different ways to approach an objective-Multiplayer, campaigne and co-op-Some attachments (silencer, flashlight and laser pointer)-A tutorialWhat I didn't like:-3 weapons (where one isn't even implemented in the tutorial yet, also not having the silencer attachment)-Forced fire mode (two are auto)-Overwhelming kick (recoil). This might be interesting, but it just throws me off too much, I can't hit the direction I was aiming at after 3 shots.-Limited number of maps-One sort of enemy (robots)-Same spawnpoint (or at least no great varity)-Hardcore multiplayer, you will get stomped-Outdated graphics (due to the time of development)-Ai..Need i say more... Pretty much the worst I encountered-Repetive as f***, going hand in hand with the limited map pool-Same controles as every FPS (no leaning etc.), making it not as tactical as it could be-Buggy (getting stuck in wall, running in straight lines without pushing the buttons etc.) (may be fixed)-Laggy! When I started playing, I had no problem. Now, I can barely shoot without crazy lag spikes (playing on a Macbook Pro mid 2013 though)I would have loved to see this become an amazing game. The idea is fantastic. However, other games outplayed them (Insurgency). The game is simply a Zombie, not alive, but also not able to die. It has a rotten body, but the heart is gold.In the state I started playing it, i would have said: Yeah, get it on sale, give it a try. I had some fun playing the co-op, however, after the 2nd playtrough I could solo the mission because i knew where what was and where the enemies spawned.Now, I say: Don't buy it, it isn't worth it. If you want to support the devs, do it. But every alcoholic has somebody who provides the alcohol. Just keep that in mind.I'm sorry, but this is not worth your money, nor your time			"

 This game made me a Tactical Space Marine Operator in Space. 10/10 With jokes aside, I really enjoy how this game is so far. It has a ton potential, I'm confident that the game will be good, since it was in development since 2005. Uh on second thought, maybe games with long devs time don't ALWAYS turn out well. *Looks at Colonial Marines* Err-uh anyways. I'm sure this'll turn out just fine. (please forgive me for mentioning that)    The singleplayer/co-op missions are atmospheric, which I absolutely love. It's like both System Shock games, the movie Aliens, and Doom 3 had a baby. (With Alien/Aliens mainly being the inspiration for any sci-fi horror game). Your eyes and ears (mainly your ears) are the only friends you'll have in those missions. As to who or what you're fighting in the missions, well you'll have to figure that out for yourself.The multiplayer is interesting, well. The maps are, for the most part. I love how they have day to night transitions, and weather effects. Not many games have that anymore. I like how it encourages stealth, and team work, I've been playing nothing but Conquest. And I have to say, being the last one alive and having to capture a point, (or waiting out their respawn timer) to bring back members in your team can be pretty exhilerating.I like what I see. A highly enjoyable game, and I expect to see great things when it comes to it's final release, because this has potential.			"

								Interstellar Marines is far from complete and won't be for a long time. However dispite this I thoroughly enjoy playing this game. I find it reminds me of my days played Halo:CE where you could just spawn in and play instead of haveing to bother with loadouts and perks which many games today do. In short I like it's simplicity. Servers are quiet and you'll have to try and play at peak times or organise a group of friends. If you enjoy a simple to join game with friends then this is your game. If you need 5000 guns and attachments and 100 maps then this is not your game.			"

								Asked for a refund when they started doing those. Got denied. Still haven't seen them deliver much of anything that they said they would deliver. If I remember then I will come back to this in 2 years to say that it is still in early access (90% sure it will probably just be dead at that point). Would not recomment buying this at all even on a big sale.			"

								A wonderful tactical shooter.This shooter is (as of Update 11) the most immersive game I've ever played.  Every detail is meant to immerse you in the game, and manages to succeed.  I found myself playing with even smaller features simply because I could.  Nice graphics, good sound, especially for early access, and interesting maps.  I especially like the domination game mode, which smaller scale shooters don't see enough of in my opinion.  That said, netcode sucks and you'll die to lag (yes, lag, not lack of skill) a lot more than you should.  Some encounters turn into hilarious spray-and-pray competitions to see who can reload faster and shoot near (not at) the enemy more.  As of update 14, this doesn't seem to be an issue as much, but reviving can be laggy.In Update 11, the addition of an assault rifle is great.  The rifle could definitely use some more ammo and an updated scope, but the general feel is fun.  There is also a new game mode, which needs some tuning but is, overall, quite fun.  UPDATE 14:  Wow this game has progressed.  Co-op is fun and frantic, and gives some great (and conquerable, if you're skilled enough) ""OH ♥♥♥♥"" moments.  8/10 in current form, would absolutely recommend.			"

								I bought the game because it was on sale in the Steam Store.  I usually do not spend my hard earned money on anything that is less than complete.  Heck, I had never even heard of it before.  The trailer hooked me and the price was right.  I checked out the game for about an hour and enjoyed myself. The dynamic changes to the map environments is brilliant.  One moment the map is at night then changes to day and then dusk and then night...like a real training simulator. The game as is now is deffinately EARLY ACCESS...meaning not much in the way of bells and whistles.  So far they only have one type of multiplayer (a domination) and one usable weapon.  They do have several maps to play on though.       It is not the actual game that amazes me, it is their plans for the future.  After looking in to Zero Point alittle (love thier company motto) and what they have planned for IM. I ""upgraded"" to Spearhead Edition, not for the perks, but to show my support in them and their dream.  If they deliver, there will be a truly amazing game on the market.  Hell, if I had the money I would fund them myself...lol.  My point is that if the devoloper stays true...this will be worth buying/playing.			"

								Ok so first off i know the game is new and is in alpha and stuff but right away there's some major problems. Now truthfully the idea of what this game is and what its being shaped to become is going to be awesome and i totally love it but right now there's various problems that are supposed to make the games graphics and designs more ""realistic"" but some of these have gone to far, for example the shadows and the trees swaying in the wind these are all great small touches in the game that all games should have but the lag for my laptop is UNBEARABLE even games with 40+ players for me lag alot less, I think truthfully that these are good implements the game should have but you need to fix the framerate or at least find ways to greatly reduce graphics such as reducing shadows to a bear minimum or canceling moving decorations. Next is the rankings, So far i have played quite some matches and theres always one guy whos rank ""TR"" 30 or 40 who has me and all my teammates on the ground before we even see him walk in the room, There needs to be an evening out rank system because either this guy has some OP gun or he's just way to skilled for new players like me trying to actually understand the game. Anyway these are just major things that need to be fixed to make the game welcoming to new players and let them have some even fun matches. Anyway love the concept these are just some problems that me and what seems other players are having. Thanks for your time and I hope to see these implements soon!			"

For COD/BF fans, there is no crouch and no prone, no slide, no overly fake elements.  This is about guns with recoil and making sure every shot counts. For TF2 fans, there are no bouncing people and gimmicks.  Some levels are dark and gritty and you can't see beyond the shine of your flashlight or the muzzle flash of your opponents.  No bright color pallettes here.			"

The project has been around for almost a decade now, and it has faced everything from lay-offs, rejections, even a failed Kickstarter. And it's still standing strong on its feet. It may be as tactical as Rainbow Six 3, but what it lacks it makes up for with its sci-fi elements. Yeah, shark creatures! Titan walkers! Full 4-player coop campaign! Damn, this game's got everything a gamer would like to see. Words alone can't describe how awesome this game will be.

Early Access Review
								The game still needs a lot of basic & simple required functionality as far as movement controls are concerned. These things are not only necessary but required in any real first person shooter. Especially those claiming to be among the best tactical shooters. While they finally added jump after a year, unfortunately they still have yet to add the most basic movement controls a soldier requires such as crouch, prone & lean. It's not that hard to add, & it should be a number one priority. These essentials are much more important then say new maps or a laser sight or a very cool & innovated helmet feature which the game employs. It just shows the dev teams priorities are bizarre after 9 updates they focus on maps & other interesting but unnecessary features when compared with essential & simple basic movement controls. VOIP would be nice as well & also an initial requirement for a tactical shooter, not as important as basic movement control but certainly a desired feature in any modern FPS.Another aspect seriously lacking after a year & 9 updates is that there is still only 1 weapon available. No pistol, no nades or any equipment. Don't let the concept art fool you. Again not sure what the devleopers priorities are but clearly movement control & weapon selection are of little or no concern to them. Go figure!The game is pretty good & has potential to be even better in the future if they ever figure out how to program simple things like crouch & prone & lean! Seeing how the developers obviously don't feel these things are important, It is my opinion that you would be much happier & satisfied getting Insurgency, America's Army Proving Ground or even Takedown Red Sabre, if you enjoy excellent tactical shooters with frequent updates & a more skilled & tactical player base. It is obvious that those games developers are able to understand the simple concept that having complete movement controls for your character are actually a number one priority. Weapon selection also would be expected. Being stuck with one weapon after a year & serious movement restriction is pathetic. There is simply no excuse for those most basic features not being included in any of the 9 updates so far. All that being said I can still recommend this game. It is unique & uses the new Unity engine which is gorgeous & has great environmental effects & has a lot of potential as does the game itself.  The developers seriously need to get on the ball. There are simply no excuses for their laziness & obvious lack of effort or perhaps skill, in providing the most essential elements in any shooter. Early access?? This game is so far from alpha is is zeta! º¿º			"

Early Access Review
								For an early access game, this one has a fantastic amount of potential. I had the pleasure of having this gifted to me, and it is easily one of my more favorite early access games, and also a powerful FPS experience.The aesthetics are awesome! The detail in the environment and two gun models is very good. The music and sounds are good - hearing bullets flying near and around you creates an extremely intense experience. One of the best features of this game, however, is the dynamic lighting effects. During gameplay, the enviroment will change - in some levels, there will be an increase/decrease of elevation in certain areas of the game (allowing for sudden height advantages/disadvantages if you are in the right/wrong place at the right/wrong time). Even more impressively, the light will switch between day/night-time cycles. During night, you can barely see directly in front of you - and using a flashlight and/or laser pointer for too long may give away your position. Stalking your target, hiding, then killing them when the lights come back on is so gratifying! Different levels also have red warning lights flaring during the night-time cycle, and this helps a little bit with visibility. So far, I have not come across any other game with lighting effects on par with Interstellar Marines.The controls are typical of an FPS and easy to familiarize yourself with. The tutorials are provided in short, informative videos provided within the game. The learning curve is minimal to moderate (and actually, to challenging) depending on your experience with the FPS genre. Now, I pride myself at being fairly strong in most competitive shooters, be it first- or third-person; however, I had a rude awakening when I first tried Interstellar Marines. The gameplay is so intense and cutthroat - you die very quickly (which I love), and it took me a few game sessions to find my bearings. Another thing I love about this game is how your heads-up display (HUD) will turn off when you are near death. Considering that friendly fire is always on, it can make firefights very interesting if you cannot remember where your allies and enemies are. You can open your helmet, however, I do not really see a point of doing this (for now). There also is no melee at the time of writing this review. The two weapons you have available is a close-to-medium-ranged submachine gun, as well as a longer-ranged assault rifle. There are no grenades to use. You can crouch, but not go prone, and sprint is already one (you can toggle it off). I am unsure if there is going to be a stamina mechanic, however, as of now, I think you can sprint indefinitely.Overall, if you are an FPS buff, you MUST try this game. You will not regret it.Definitely recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

								A genuinely tense gaming experience without resorting to cheap jumpscares... and it's not even really a horror game.  The devs are active within the community and if you join the steam community group you'll be notified about the community events where one of the devs livestreams the game on twitch, talks to players on teamspeak, and everyone has a really good time so be sure to check that out.One thing people forget when commenting on how incomplete an early access game is, is how much opportunity there is to give feedback at a time where it can actually be implemented into the game.  It's obvious the team is very passionate and dedicated to finishing this game so I'm not worried about that like with some others on early access.			"

Early Access Review
Great game for night aloneI purchased this game 2 years earlier & am a little surprised it is not yet out of EARLY ACCESS.-Nice FPS shooter,-Good graphics,-An intriguing story,-Sci-fi (space) -Various modes of playing with thrilling game-play,I played a few hours of this game, I do have some experience, the DEV's are an excellent team;I'm not saying that because I chat with any of them at all, rather, I say it because of the quality of the game between updates.Game On...

Early Access Review
								I love Interstellar Marines!!!It's currently a game in progress but totally worth getting right now. Several types of game play:PlaygroundSingle playerCo-opMultiplayerHell WeekMaps:Maps are dynamic, anamorphic and dirty unlike other FPS games.In Breif:Dynamic elements:Ever changing light and weather conditions. These change at random intervals and the associated sounds increase the realizm of the moment. One moment a gentle breeze and sunny skies, the darkness rolls in with hard wind and driving rain, a short while later... Darkness falls and silence... A flashlight or walking could give you away...Anamorphic elements:Most other FPS maps are quite static with maybe a door or a window to break to achieve an objective. In ISM many maps physically change often causing you to reroute to achieve an objective. Matched with everchanging environmental variables this is quite engaging.Dirty elements:I love the fact that the physical ripples of water motion can give away a creeping enemy. You hide in long blades of tall grass or have ferns providing disguising you for an unaware opponent.Tracking a target that runs into a bush and still nailing him; but they run behind a tree and you miss... A missed shot can give you away. Sometimes you're in a combination bushes grass and trees, you might be spotted and shot at. They might hit or miss depending on that coverage. It's harder to hit what you can't clearly see...This provides a better sense of realism than other POP FPS games with maps that have clear sightlines in all directions and no cover.Currently there are 3 guns:Pistol with ironsightSubmachine gun with dot sight x2 zoomBattle rifle with ACOG x4 zoomAll are equipped with Flashlights Suppressors and Lazers.Each have different fire rates, damages and accuracies.Fresh free content on an almost monthly basis with huge updates quarterly to semi annually.The Dev's:ISM Devs are all approachable and easy to talk to. There's an event every Monday/Tuesday where the dev's join into a public game and interact directly with the players. Don't miss out! They even have a teamspeak channel for all to speak freely.I'll most more as ISM evolves. Don't pass up on this great game!THE SHORTER BREIF REVIEW:This is the best game you never played!The maps are dirty and anamorphic with dynamic weather conditions.The Dirty: You can actually hide in the environment. Stratiegic use of camoflauge and environmental terrain is fantastic; actually blending in to your surroundings!Anamorphic: The terrain constantly changes. You have to change your thinking on the fly to achieve objectives.  This is unheard of in  any other game ever played!Dynamic:The weather variables add a unique element to play. One monent its sunny and calm making you easily heard as you run; next its stormy and raining which maskes your running but also makes it harder to hear and spot enemey movements. then it's almost pitch black. Do you wisk using your tactical flashlight and give away your position or do you fumble in the dark hoping to catch an enemy off guard?Extras:There are single, co-op and multiplayer missions with adjustable difficulties on the single and co-op missions. also there is the scavanger hellweek.Hellweek is meant to mimic the real world marines final rite of passage. 9 different servers all interconnected with up to 64 players each! It lives up to the name!This game is in development and the dev team is working hard to release patches that are hassle free; they are doing an excellent job!Be part of this great legacy!			"

								Now before i get any kind of response to people who see the red thumb, i would like to say that i do not DISLIKE the game, i simply feel it is not developed enough to buy it and expect to have hours of gameplay. I actually really like the possibilities that this game could have. So now that i got that off my chest, i would like to tell the people who are looking at this review for some kind of 'make it or break it' statement. This game is not fully developed, with a single gun, 7 maps, and a minimap. I did my research on this game and its developers, and i find that with such a small development team, they are doing as much as they can in their power to get this game up to its full potential. I personally bought into this game knowing it will be something great, and I put money into it to expecting pre-alpha. I bought it to hopefully be that extra tiny push to get them developing. In conclusion, if you are here to buy a game that is in pre-alpha, know that it is in pre-alpha and in its most simplistic form. If you would like to invest into something that will be great, after some time, feel free to join in! For the Devs :)Just want to let you know how much i want this game to become something great, and how much i want this game to be my next favorite PC shooter. Don't let the negativity get to you. Keep it up and make this game worth mine and everyones money!			"

								At time of writing --- 5/31/2014I definitely reccomend this game. Consider it's still in alpha, the gameplay it does deliver is fluid, fast paced and to be honest, I don't see anything like it around. The maps are highly developed with a high level of attention to detail, and perform in game perfectly. The two weapons available are both balanced and have their ideal situations. Of course the game being in alpha has a few issues, the main one being lack of optimisation for computers. I will give a warning that people with non-specialised computers (i.e. computers not built for gaming) will find the experience unnattractive due to low framerates and latency, so waiting for future updates would probably be best. One point however, it would be appreciated if you could have more than 6 (or however many there are) graphics settings. However, they have been promised in future updates.All in all, I could not reccomend this game anymore. Besides, for the maximum price of £13.99 it's a worthy investment to a game that in time, could rival most of the AAA FPS's out there. "

Early Access Review
NOTE: THIS IS A FANBOY REVIEW!!This review was made in 2013. I was quite the fanboy of the game back then. I may update this review to fit the games current state and to get rid of my past fanboyism.I understand that some people think that this game sucks because you can't jump (which you can now), crouch, there's only one weapon ATM.But hey! How many shooting weapons did Mario have in the first Mario game? One! (The fireball) Was it a bad game? Not it was really fun and it still is! (I know cause I have it for the NES :-D)So why is that relevant? That is because it's just features! You don't even need these features for a game to be fun! I understand that some people have standards these days because every FPS game include loads of weapons and stuff but in the end: You don't need it to have fun! Simple games can be fun! Remember Minecraft in alpha? That was really simple but still really fun!Also! This is a game somewhere between alpha and pre-alpha so what did you expect? You're not seppose to expect games with a lot of content if you buy games on Early Access!Now! Since this is a somewhat review I guess I gotta say my overall opinion about the game and stop telling people why they are wrong about the game.I will review this while keeping in mind that it is in alpha.Interstellar Marines is a really fun game if you get together with some guys in a match. It can be challenging if you're new to the game but it doesn't take much time to get the hang of it.The graphics are pretty decent for an indie title.The game runs smoothly even at 40 FPS (I have a hard time playing other games at 40 FPS).The maps are fun and exciting and there are many ways to trick or storm your enemy with many entry points, hiding places and sniping positions.The maps also have this really amazing dynamic weather system where it changes the weather a few times while playing a match. Some times it gets really foggy and other times it gets so dark that you can't see anything without the flashlight on but if you turn it on you will reveal your position to the enemy. I personally think that the darkness in this game is one of the most amazing things in a game. My heart always starts pumping of excitment when it gets dark and this is one of those few games that arn't scared of the dark cause I've seen a lot of games with dark level where you can just barly see without a flashlight but in this game it's a different story! Which adds some realism and immersion to the game.I got a little ahead of my self with that darkness talking so let's just get to the pros and cons.Pros:+ Playable at 40 FPS+ Fun and challenging+ Dynamic weather+ Amazing darkness+ Decent graphics+ Great maps for tactical opportunities(+) One really unice map that changes the height of it's floors while playing+ Fun gamemode (Domination like)+ Nice sound+ Singleplayer room made for players to test the new featuresCons:- Only one playable gamemode even though they've made two- None of their two singeplayer modes from the official site in the game- No connection to your user made on the official site- Progress feels kinda slow(I didn't like to write that last con because I'm a fan of the game and I understand why it's going slowly but it doesn't change the fact that it's going slowly)So this is my review of Interstellar Marines in it's current version (version 7).Since this is a game in alpha state I might make a new review of it when it's fully released cause you can't really rate a product that isn't done yet. If this was the final release then yes. It would not be worth the money but it is in alpha so I do actually think this is worth the money.- Martin Schultz / Mtsmts			"

								A very intense and suspenseful FPS. Good overall game mechanics and excellent single-player and co-op missions. If there's anything negative about the game, is its slow development. But they release regular updates and with each update the game seems to get better and better.Also, them robots scare the crap out of me. 8.5/10PS: I have played many hours before this game was released on Steam Early Access. I plan to play more of it soon here on Steam.			"

This is an awesome game for Pre-Alpha. When you first play this game, you probably will get slaughtered all the time, but practice makes perfect. At the time of writing this the game does not have many features or gamemodes but the devs have been hard at work making the game we know and love today. If you don't like it now, give it a year or two and then come back, it should be way better then :)9/10 "

								To be honest, It is a good game but the player base is so small I found it to be a waste of money. When it is finally out of EA i'll take a look at it again. Don't buy this game unless you have a group of friends to do co-op with.			"

								Very interesting game and concept.Overall, I'd recommend this game to people interested in an ""Alien Swarm""-like game, except in first person. Heavy emphasis on squad tactics and strategy over reflex shooting.The 10$ price tag is a bit high for the amount of content in the game, but there is a high amount of replayability for the achievement hunter or perfectionist.Keep in mind, this is an early access game, which means that it is not meant to compete with other, similarly priced titles.

								I want to like this game. It has a great concept, but the development is way to slow. I know that they have had development problems (e.g. switching engines) but there is too little progress.			"

								The game just doesn't have enough content to support a decent playerbase. The multiplayer is bad and you will have trouble finding a game to even play. The singleplayer I thought had so much potential, but the devs just won't lean towards it anymore. The updates are too small to get anyone back into the game and eventually ZPS will simply run out of funding before anyhting good gets done. Do not buy this game.			"

								I cannot write a full review since the game isn't fully out yet although that it kina is like a Dayz first person shooter in space(because it's been in develpment forever) I still think that the game is pretty awsome and fun to play with friends. Before anyone checks my playtime on the game I want you to know that it is on another account that I no longer have acces to since I forgot the password. Anyways I think this game is fun and is a must play with friends even though it's early access.			"

								Now first off the game had potential. I say had because progress is painfully slow. I understand that the devs have had very tough times and have been screwed over countless times. I simply don't recommend the game because updates take way too long to come out, have little content (don't you dare get on with me about hell week. few of us asked for that), don't progress the goal of the game (co-op campaign but we get multiplayer instead), and add more bugs that don't get fixed. I've been optimistic with this game for too long. I can't do it anymore. Plain and simple. It's in development hell and won't ever come out.			"

								Great potential but the game sufffers from huge performance issues. This game does not lack content especially for a  early access game as it includes Single Player, Multiplayer, Coop and a new feature called hell week (i'm not totally sure what this is; I would like to play it but no one is ever on the servers) . Interstellar Marines has a solid story despite it being fairly difficult to complete. Multiplayer is ok but there are never anyone on the servers. Sometimes you will find the devs on european servers but i am yet to see players on any other server. Lastly IM suffers greatly from performance issues, My computer (amd fx 6350 + sapphire tri x 290) runs medium settings, 1920x1080 at ~20 fps. this game has great potential but is currently lacking many critical features.

								By far the best environmental variables captured in a FPS ever. I have played FPS since DOOM and this game has nailed 100% the feeling of player weight, size and inertia in a game. The lighting sounds and environmental conditions are stellar. The maps are challenging and allow for a tactical approach.  The AI are stupid enough to boost ones ego but smart enough to continue playing against them. The AI difficulty is adjustable so once a player gets used to the game mechanics, he/she can crank up the difficulty. Weapon variety and ballistics just feel right. Multiple game modes and maps keep the game interesting and the sound of a 600lb robot running at you will get the adrenaline pumping. I can go on and on about how this game feels but until you try for yourself words will just not do it any justice. 5 out of 5, even in Beta.			"

								A friend told me about this game, and I thought to myself... oh no not another fps game... what can they do differently that 100 other games haven't already done?Well after trying it for a short 1 hr, I can say this game is a cut above the rest, already it demonstrates more common sense and playability than other fps's I have tried, and I just had to pop in and write something positive about this game and how (I would hope) it to go forward in the months and years to come.I could start with the level design, realistic environments that really immerse you into the game, shadows of opposing players running through your screen makes your heart jump every single time, the terrain is almost flawless every detail is considered and implemented perfectly, and try to remember this is pre-release and they have done so much already, I cannot imagine how a finished level will look and feel to play in, but I do know it will be an awesome sight, and a terrible fright !! Each level design is made to have you gripped to your console, after playing a couple of levels I noticed a slight pain in my right arm, FROM GRIPPING THE MOUSE TOO HARD !!! These levels are intense, the design is breathtaking and although it's per-release I would still recommend you and a few friends playing multiplayer for a couple of hours and I bet 20,000 zorks you will be hooked.Moving on to actual game play, it's about as real life as you can get (without getting shot ofc) in Pre-release we only have the smg, which is fine I would like to get a hand on a rifle or frag grenade but I'm sure it will come in good time, when it's ready and not before. Dealing with the smg is a lot different than every other fps I've seen (which isn't everyone, but a few)So lets say you spot a shadow in the dark of night, and you pump a few rounds into it getting your first kill of the evening, you'll notice the guns aim doesn't reset to center, oh no it stays in the last place you fired it, until you aim somewhere else, I have to say I love this feature, it's about as close real as real gets, absolutely no easy aiming. Everything must be done intentionally and with extreme malice, which will quickly sort out the pro's from the novices in no time. We have yet to see some kind of ranking system, to allow for the learning curb in this game, every at the moment gets mashed together and the best team wins. But I guess right now Zero Point Software is working on game play over ranking mechanics at the moment, but don't worry we already know this game is going to be amazing to play, casual, competitive or solo, so I don't think anyone cares about mechanics just yet. (but I'm sure it's on the list)Stamina and exhaustion, keeping a good balance seems to be the key here, when your exhausted you can't really aim correctly or sprint... or jump very high, and recovery time can be an issue if you run into a building full of the enemy team, in the dark.... to afraid to turn on your flashlight in case you get spotted ! (would love to see some thermal imaging, though perhaps only heat signatures and not obstacles to allow some fairness also.) So for right now I sprint for short bursts at a time, not allowing exhaustion to overcome me, (You don't really get feeling of moving fast when you sprint, perhaps some blurred edges and slightly increasing the speed of your sprint would help make it feel like your character is moving faster)Weapons - SMG at the moment, and it acts and feels like a SMG should, good work on that, and I hope to see as much thought and detail in the rest of the weapons once they are released.Solo content - Looking forward to it, and I hope it has as much diversity as ME3 when it comes to missions, non liner progression, pick-ups and power ups, and perhaps even a squad selection window even more immersion.Overall it looks amazing, feels great, plays well and can still make your heart jump or skip a beat when it gets very intense, recommended to all players who love realism and high detail, and with upcoming releases and updates this game is going to be one game you just can't put down.Great work so far ZeroPoint,			"

								Great game with fun gameplay and beatiful sounds. The coop is probably the best gamemode at the moment. I recommend playing this game with a virtual surround sound headset or something like that for the best experience.			"

								For a pre-alpha, this game looks amazing, and handles just as well. I'm able to run this game at highest graphical settings on a 2011 Macbook air and still nail a solid FPS, which speaks volumes for the excellent backend work that has been done so far. Don't take its performance to mean it's graphically unimpressive, however: the game is one of the best looking FPS's I've seen in a very long time, with dynamic lighting and environments, fully realized particle effects, and an incredibly fun shooting system.Hell, this game already surpasses some of its inspirations, and I can't wait to see how it develops in the future. Well worth the Spearhead Edition.			"

								This game says single, multiplayer, and co-op. There is no co-op, and there is no single player. Only multiplayer. Add to that a whopping 20 players online at any one particular time... Well you get the idea. The game seems like it has potential. However with almost no players and two very big parts of the game MISSING, I have to say this game is a go... Preceeded by a no that is.

								Development since Date: Jul 2, 2013, I cannot recommend this game since there have been no viable updates or foreseeable completion. It seem like a great game but at this time its mostly dead, no direction and nothing but empty promises of features. I have no actual rating for the game but I personally will no longer invest in kick starter projects. It seems as the gaming industry has become a cesspool of failure.			"

								As of writing this review I don't believe that this game is worth the buy. I was stupid enough to buy the Spearhead Edition when this ♥♥♥♥ first came out, but I would never buy it again. I'm pretty sure I have more hours on Takedown: Red Sabre, and thats pretty sad. The problem with this game is that there really isn't much progress since the game first showed up on Steam. A pvp multiplayer that has like a whole 20 people on at any given time, a coop mode that I haven't seen anyone playing, and of course the single-player. PVP comes in 2 flavors: 1) Everybody is hiding in a corner 2) Everybody is running around frantically shooting their smg's at the first person they see. Coop and singleplayer are completely interchangable experiences. You shoot robots, every robot is pretty much the same, and will either have aimbot level accuracy or shoot nowhere near you until its aimbot.exe is done loading. You'd have more entertainment value from your $15 if you spent it on a box with nothing in it.			"

								Interstellar Marines, early access, bugs and a very fun game! Wow, I think Insurgency and CoD had a baby guys. Very interesting story/lore in the campaign missions that can be played on both single player and coop. Multiplayer is fun, a little annoying at times with no kill board and one-line at a time chat box but none-the-less, it is a fun experience. Play casual or register at Phyre gaming[www.phyregaming.com] to compete in tournaments. Over all 9/10. I definitly recomend this game to anyone with a PC with mid range specs (2.5GHz CPU, NVidia GT with 2GB. Anything better and you're good to go).			"

								Interstellar Marines is hard for me to recommend in its current condition. While it's visually spectacular and deserves some slack for the fact that it's still not complete, it does not have any partically unique nor remarkable gameplay aspects. They've said it themselves: it is an overly ambitious, wannabe sci-fi experience that is trying to fit in with the quality of popular shooters such as Half-Life and Doom. The problem is, however, instead of offering any new or simple themes to the gameplay, this game clones the gameplay of your average online shooter. For an indie game to become successful (like Minecraft, Fez or Amnesia) it has to introduce new gameplay features that dramatically change the experience in its genre. Interstellar Marines tries to do this but only manages to create minor enhancements to the gameplay such as 'lifting up your helmet' or 'not being able to figure out who is and isn't your teammate after you've been shot too much'. One feature, however, that I really enjoyed on a few of the maps is the variation of brightness or conditions (such as weather and fog) on the maps. On some of the maps this can be quite annoying, but on others this really helps create a genuine atmosphere and truly immerses you in the gameplay.The best I can say is that you're guaranteed some fun playing some of the brilliantly designed maps and immersing yourself in the impressive graphics and typical FPS mechanics. I'm also looking forward to seeing how they eventually execute the single player gameplay.Unfortunately though, if this game is trying to rival other Sci-Fi shooters, it has a long way to go. Simple aspects that are essential for creating immersive and strategic gameplay such as crouching, meleeing or throwing grenades still haven't been added to the experience, and this must be included in the SOONEST UPDATE POSSIBLE. Furthermore, in the eventual finished product, I would expect to see some real, brand new ways to play the game that we've never seen before, especially considering the goals it is trying to achieve. IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST GAME POSSIBLE, DO SOMETHING ORIGINAL OTHERWISE THERE'S NO POINT.Hopefully we'll eventually see this game in a much better quality than it is at the moment, but for now I simply can't recommend it to anyone until there's a large increase in overall content.

Early Access Review
								To be completely honest, I didn't buy this game, I invested in it. Several years ago they had a promotion for people who spent a certain amount of money to obtain ""stock"" in the company. I was one of those people. (I had to sign paperwork and mail it to them.)This was all before it was ever greenlit on steam. Now, a lot of people say that it's slow or it won't be finished. Most people compare a small time-frame of from EA release until now, or an even shorter time-frame of ""Free Week"" until now. What I compare is literally from the time I invested in it, it was a browser-based unity engine, without an actual ""client"" to now.Then, it had a few things to play around with, empty maps to explore, the visor, changing weather/day-night cycles, etc. Now it has multiplayer, coop, an emerging ""campaign,"" and even some fun little things to find in some of the maps. (Personally found one of the shark models and took a screen-shot of it.)While a lot of Early Access is considered failures or scams, eventually being abandoned by devs, I don't believe this is one of them. Sure it's slow, but how long does it take a AAA company to pump out a mediocre game with teams of 100s of people? Two or three years? This game has less people, and are working on a level of immersion I have yet to see in an FPS. I'd say that would take a lot of time. Now, call me crazy, maybe I wasted hundreds of dollars, (Yes, I spent several hundred dollars), but I am excrutiatingly picky about games I buy, and even pickier about games I ""invest"" in. To date, only one of them has ""failed"" me, and that's Star Forge. Should this game succeed, I can see it changing the face of the FPS genre from here on out. A lot of ""new"" FPS's are simply revamped graphics with the same content. This one promises to introduce new ""features.""Bottom line:Don't buy if you are: Impatient, don't have faith in Early Access as a general rule, expect a whole lot of content right out of the box (current box at the time of this writing)Do buy: If you actually read what I wrote, are willing to place faith in a potentially genre-changing title, don't mind slower updates.Why: Because no matter if you buy it now or not, if the game fails, it's impossible that you will have wasted as much money as myself (Unless you also bought into the stock option back then, in which case I was on the lower tiers).

								I've spend 1 hour with this game and I know only one thing: in current state it's rubbish. Lack of content is not a problem. Main reason I really, really don't like this game is shooting mechanics - delay between hitting the trigger and starting shooting is huge. Bullet speed is also freaking slow. Close combat (less than 2 meters) looks like some comedy - 2 guys going around each other emptying mags after mags. If you're looking for some realistic tactical game - buy ArmA 3.It's just bad - very bad.			"

								Yes, there are little players. Yes, it IS very raw. Yes it is in Early Acces for a long time. BUT... This shooter has a very strong base. It has an awesome sci-fi setting, interesting gameplay. I don't know why other people write negative reviews just because of some low budget problems! The only thing that makes me go ""argh!"" is the requirements. It said GTX 120 and around 4GB RAM as recomended but it has only 21 fps (which are rather stable) on GTX 330M (maybe because of M?) and 8GB RAM.Overall Conclusion: Good game!

								This game is missing too much and the gameplay itself is not enjoyable enough to make up for the lack of content. Six years is a long time to be working on a game and I expect there to be more available after all that time. I will say I do like the coop missions. They have a suspenseful atmosphere. Like I have been saying though, I just wish there was more content than just the same two enemies, same two guns, and same objectives. Definitely not worth the $19. I would recommend it if the price was below $10.			"

								I've been following this game since 2009.... what can I say, the dev team is inspirational and their commitment to telling a story through game is amazing.ATM the game consists only of a variety of multiplayer and co-op features that serve the role of providing a living platform for the team to develop around.Even though these game modes may seem seperate from the final goal they actually fold in amazingly well with the narrative providing almost a pre-prologue setting as you ""train"" (play the game) for the interstellar marines.Pros:- Amazing goals and story to be told.- Wonderfully executed deep understanding of what makes a game immersive and captivating.- Enjoyable early access/beta game modes.Cons:- Buying into this early access is a long term investment that requires a lot of trust in the dev team.- Unless you are commited and interesting in the long term journey of this game the current material    may seem pointless/repetative/boring after a few hours play due to the slowly developing features etc.- Due to this nature there aren't a lot of players online at any one time which limits server choice.Do I recomend you jump on this? HELL YES!!!But please don't expect some full stand-alone game.This is about joining a story.... the end goal for us all is the narrative to come (just ask the devs... they wont bite)			"

								This game is looking like a very promising space-shooter. I purchased the spearhead edition of the game because I thought it was very cool how the developers promised to put your name in the credits. It also comes with an extra copy of the game which you can send to a friend, as well as the game's soundtrack and concept art. Interstellar Marines is different from other shooters in a really cool way. Dynamic environments. Every few minutes or so the weather,lighting or structure of the map itself will change. I like this because it forces you to switch up strategies depending on the condition of the battlefield. The changing environments will affect your combat behavior as well as the behavior of your enemies. Barriers will be erected, the game will go dark or flash red emergency lights. It's kinda reminded me of paintball in a lot of ways. You can be eliminated quickly, but if you are strategic enough, you can prevail.I can't wait when this game is released in its final form.			"

								I don't even have to be saying this, go buy this game! This is one of the most intense and immersive FPS ive played, it has amazing potential and is just hellafun, I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS MUCH FUN WITH AN !EARLY ACCSES GAME! The maps are amazing, the way the enviornment and sounds works make it feel real. I love the weather, usually in games like minecraft i would hate the rain, but i absolutly love it when it rains in this game, its amazing. And in most games, the sound is somtimes overlooked by users, one of the many things that stands out about this game is the sounds, you CANT play this game and not stop to enjoy the sounds of rain patting down on barricades... even if you just got shot in the head. I pat the men and women on the back who put those sounds in the game. The controls are very smooth and the character animations are great! One thing that also stands out is the lack of a HUD, usually in FPS's you have your health, amunition, and energy all just stuck to your face, in Interstellar Marines you are looing through a simple dang fancey lookin helmet, nothing to break the immersion. And the way they did the helmet ammo display is awesome, also if you press h you can lift up your helmet, making for an amazing immersive experience that i havent seen in another game. Overall i highly reccomend INTERSTELLAR MARINES and i love where its going. And in this game, if you play your cards right, you CAN be a one man army.			"

								I thought I would edit my review, seeing as I had been playing it a bit more over the past few days.Interstellar Marines still is very much in Early Access, and has been for as long as I can remember, seeing it pop up on Kickstarter some years ago. Though fear not, though we've had some shaky EA games recently, the attention to detail and updates coming to this game show no sign of slowing down. We received a campaign type map mode to play either singleplayer or cooperatively, there's also another more linear map that can be played singleplayer or cooperatively, and then there are the whole host of survival and extinction maps to play either singleplayer or cooperatively. This is all on top of the previous PvP game mode that was already implemented.The coop and singleplayer have you facing against both armed and unarmed CTRs, or Combat Training Robots. There is a small bug where when you kill an armed one it still comes up saying unarmed, and it says +15 points for killing one when you only get 5; but they're minor issues.The dev team at Zero Point Software really know how to do atmosphere. In some of the survival modes, near the end of the sequence the whole map goes pitch black, you HAVE to use your flashlight. Of course, this means you can only see in the direction you're facing, it also means that when you reload the light points into the air somewhat as it's an underbarrel mounted flashlight. This makes for super intense moments when you can hear the unarmed CTRs running towards you, but have no idea where they are.The environments are also amazing, the rain and effect it leaves on your helmet visor, the fog, the alarm lighting, and just the areas you're dropped into in general. Definitely a fantastic game, if you ever see it in a bundle, I would buy it without question as you will not regret it, even the Steam store asking price isn't bad for what you're getting, especially with the stream and quality of updates.

								Interstellar Marines. In it's current form is very entertaining and fulfilling experience after you understand the mechanics underlying everything. Now, the game does suffer from poor framerates for the average computer and tanks my FPS with AA applied. Being that this is Update 10 it's to be expected. Now, this game brings some serious game changers to the FPS scene. You have variable environments mid level, meaning that you have daylight, rain, red alerts, or pitch black and likely more to come. Then you have actual movement mechanics, aiming mechanics, and cover system. This game has a large potential to blow up in popularity in later stages of development and I wholeheartedly look forward to whats to come. Recommended.			"

								If you enjoy a game you can play for HOURS on end, a game where there are ""wholly ♥♥♥♥"" moments and jump scares with the enemy around a corner or in the shadows; this game is that. Interstellar Marines is a game that places you in the front lines as an interstellar marine, combat trained and ready to go into many training zones filled with extreamely lifelike sounds and weather simulations that make you feel as if you are really there. Although, this game is in Pre-Alpha it is a great game, with emersable graphics and sounds, smooth gameplay if you know how to custumize the settings, and easy to play; if your comp is glitchy there is the visual lag customization in the settings allowing ou to smooth out those irritating laggs and play with visability. BUT! we al know what the betas and alphas offer guys, so be prepared for crazy glitches and wild shizz for there is a lot to make you laugh, yell/rage, and even cry over those sneeky little arachnids in the corners of the dreadful walls. all together i say buy the spearhead package, for this game has a lot to offer and more to contribute, but, in a new perspective with all the games people-THIS. IS. THE. NEXT. BEST. THING. SINCE. Counter Strike!!!			"

								it is fun and good but the only thing I would say is that I haven't played that much time on it but it is not has good as cod or battlefield the game story is not that good and the online is really hard because the players have been playing the game since it come out. some people have played hundreds of hours on the game that means they got all the guns and a really good score per much. I do recommend this game for people how want a challenge in the online games it is very good and it is worth the money that you pay for it.			"

								ISM is a great take on the old tactical FPS genre. It punishes head-long derp rushes a la Halo, GOW, or Unreal Tournament, instead rewarding careful movement, foresight, tactical analysis, and a steady ♥♥♥♥-you gun hand. While in it's current state (Update 10 as of this writing) feels sort of limited (one gun, no customization, missing several features of other FPS game like sprinting or melee), the gunplay is solid, the movement is slick, the graphics as beautiful (especially on ultra. Dat Pc Master Race), and the maps are amazing (Pitch black? Do you dare risk the flashlight for some clear sight that everyone else can see? Turn on the laser sight for some accurate hipfire at the expense of everyone seeing where the ♥♥♥♥ you are? Decisions, decisions!).I can't recommend this as a full game, not in it's current state. But as an Early Access game?♥♥♥♥ yeah.Get in here, Marine. Training starts in five.			"

								First impressions: I love it.Looks: a lot of post-processing going on, and without it I'd say it would look along the lines of Half-Life 2. Runs smoothly, looks very immersive with its dynamic weather and small touches like the raindrops hitting the helmet. The helmet itself features a HUD and if you lift the helmet up it's a HUDless view. A few graphical bugs here and there, but nothing gamebreaking at all; things like your gun disappearing into the wall if you stand too close, or snow falling through walls.Gameplay: plays like a tactical Source game, with aim down sights and sprinting. A lot of emphasis on the sound around you, and the environment plays a big part in the gameplay, like when lights dim and you're forced to use your flashlight, while exposing your position in doing so. At the moment there is only one gun to use, so everything is balanced, and the hitboxes are fair.Overall, it's a very fun game with a level of immersion you rarely see in shooters. It almost seems like a finished product, yet it's only in alpha stage. Very interested to see what the devs make of it over the coming months.			"

								This is indeed an interesting game, and I do recommend it. But it truly matters what kind of gamer you are. Myself, a tactical kind of player, I enjoy this game a lot. But for those of you run and gun kind of players, you'll need to learn some patience. I do recommend the game, although it can get kind of boring at least when played alone.

								Its's a good game... spooky as hell. Decent visuals, fairly smooth gameplay. For what it is however, I think they should lower the price by about 50%. Only get this one sale. There are no checkpoints in the game. I played for about half an hour... died.. and went right back to the beggining.. which was a bit annoying. If you die in co-op and don't get revived fast enough, you're stuck in spectator mode for the rest of the level... QUIT.From what I can tell so far there are no grenades of any kind in this game... I hope that is subject to change because you definitely feel the need for em.			"

Interstellar Marines may come off as a generic tactical shooter upon first impressions, but once you start playing, you'll see that this game has a few interesting mechanics that helps separate this game from the plethora of other tactical FPSs on the market. The game features a very interesting, and realistic lighting system, where some times the map will put players into total darkness. This will force players to start using their flashlight which will of course give them away to enemy fire. Certainly an interesting take on a risk-reward system for a tactical FPS. The game also features mid-match dynamic level alterations. The game map will change, closing and opening new choke points and paths, mid match, in real time. This has a dynamic effect on the game field. Lastly the game features a ridiculous amounts of capture points in it's game mode. This came off as a negative, almost as a design flaw at first, but the more I played I saw what the designer had in mind. This tactical shooter encourages spiting up and covering ground, rather than the usual, 7 man in a choke point cluster F*** that the usual tactical shooter tend to lean towards.The game's audio, and visual is impressive, and it's attention to detail as well as it's lighting is equally so.The game is not with out it's faults though. In it's current stage of early access, there is no single player campaign, minimal tutorial, only one game mode, and only the default rifles hurt this game's variety. The game also has some net code issues as it has noticeable and undeniable bullet lag. Interstellar Marines also face the hurdle of developing a robust and active community, in the face of hundreds if not thousands of other tactical shooters, fighting for the same audience. Currently the game's community is active, but relatively small. Only 1-3 servers will any sort of population at any given time, or even less.But overall, Interstellar Marines is a very enjoyable game that has a pile of potential! I think the game should change it's name as it's incredibly generic, and also promote it's unique light and dark play more to help interest more people.Pros:- Unique Light / Dark mechanic- Unique mid-game battlefield transformation mechanic- Impressive visuals, especially the lighting- Very enjoyable and playable, even as an early accessCons:- Needs more variety- Net code needs a lot of working out- Needs to build a larger community			"

Early Access Review
								Once again, I haeve returned to the realm of Gaben to pick up a game. ""Oh, joy!"" I thought to myself. ""I wonder what glorious new things Steam has to offer!""And here it is.Intertellar Marines is an early access first-person shooter based off games such as System Shcock 2 (a good sign) and Counter Strike (a better sign!). However, this is an early access game. Like, really early. Really really really early. How early, you ask? It's in Beta 0.8.5., I think. So yeah, pretty freaking early. It's mostly just a core idea and concept art right now, but this game has potential. Lots of potential.Most indie games have reletively low-res graphics. Not so with this game, which has graphics that could hold their own against a modern AAA game. There's not many mechanics so far. You can lift up your helmet (to give you slightly better visibility and provide a shield from rain) and use your flashlight and laser, both of which are like great, shining beacons of ""SH00T H3R3!!1!!1!!"" There's also only one gun, an SMG that, quite frankly, sways too much. One would think an accomplished 22nd century space marine could keep an SMG a little steadier, but one would be wrong. Team killing is always enabled, causing some, uh, ""misunderstandings"" (sorry to all my teammates I killed. You look kind of like the enemy). On occasion, a teammate will walk in front of you in a firefight and you'll accidently blow his damn fool head off. I can imagine it now... ""But Sir, he walked into my bullets! It's not my fault!""The weather system is superb. Sometimes it'll rain, sometimes it'll snow, other times it'll be dark as ♥♥♥♥ and you won't be able to see, so you will naturally turn on your flashlight and promptly get a welcome committee from your enemie's bullets. The game lets you be as stealthy as you want, escecially in dark areas. Watch out when it gets dark, the ninjas are everywhere...So, all in all, for a hyper-early access game, Interstellar Marines has loads of potential. So guys? Make Interstellar Marines badass. You have my confidence.			"

								The game has a short learning curve, and is very frustrating at first when you you're first learning to see the enemy. But once you get that down, the gameplay is pretty tight. I get frustrated with how vague the mechanics are though; you can be spraying your opponent down in CQC and nobody will land shots, and it's unclear how the gunplay really works. I just kinda go with the flow and things generally work out though. I can't wait to see VoIP implemented, because this game could be very fun to play competetively with a team. It's tight. But god damn, give me a RIFLE would you? The SMG is the only weapon in the game as of 3.28.14, but they plan on adding more. All in all, not my favorite yet, but I'm loving where it's going and it's not going to go into my Steam Graveyard like so many other titles.			"

								Best gaming experience i've had so far. The depth given by the game is amazing. it perfectly takes your mind from your head and puts it inside the games Helmet and HUD and give you the most fantastic game graphics; lighting and atmosphere (musical and visual).Its really a mind twist from all those games up there, with hints and in-game aim assist all delivered by a guy that liked to sing; had money but no voice; became a rap\pop\rasta\turqish serenades\romanian dancing and got a gig on your games music...To sum it up is hard but here it goes:Stuning Concept of Depth trough the active helmet which adds 1 more level above other games that try to imerse you in.Breath Taking game modes and by that i mean your forever in motion objectives.Day and Night simulation is even more breath taking then the last one, being trown in pitch black darkness, with dim coloured light pulsing from the suit; buildings; laser or gun fire and having to guess if the guy in front of you is your teammate or not,Amazing Graphics delivered with a unreal briliance mixed, with amazing ambient (visual or graphical) powered by brilliant innovating minds that created this 3D Surreal First Person Shooter and so on for some time.Worth the triple price i've paid for the Spearhead Edition.

It's definitely far from finished, but even in its current state its more challenging and addictive than any fps that I've played in recent memory. Which is really saying something for a game where crouching is not currently implemented. Its flawed, unforgiving, and literally can only continue to get better as its foundations are already so solid. This is something every hardcore fps fan needs to have in their collection, and 15 is a ridiculously great price is this game even delivers half of the features that are planned for it. Buy it now!

								This game is in an extremely early stage but it's got a lot of great ideas. It looks very good so far and plays fairly smoothly despite the game not even having crouching or jumping yet. Singleplayer is not ready yet and multiplayer is very limited so keep that in mind.			"

								This looks like it could be an amazing game. I dont understand how one of the first implementations was not Controller support though? It looks to me like the team has spent a lot of time creating different environment modes that turn on in graphical fashions with rotating arches carrying lights which seems besides the point to me. It is cool but I don't understand how it in anyway revolutionary. I read reviews saying that even at an early stage this is a completely playable game but i disagree, At the moment it is just running around empty maps. There are about 9 servers all of which are completely full whenever I try to join. The rest ofthe levels are just empty ""Playgrounds"". The sandbox mode is interesting and displays the damage system well but in the back ground there is a wierd repeating track of someone with such a thick accent coimplaining about something that the only word you can pick out is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ each time it repeats.I am very much looking forward to playing this game when it is playable. But at the moment I don't understand it. It is early release because you want to recieve feedback but at the moment the only feedback i have is add Controller support. Beyond that I have noting to provide feedback about!			"

								First of all what you need to know is that as of right now when im writing this review (22-1-2015) the game is still in the Pre Alpha Stage of development and that it is developed by an Indie Studio. So it is far from being completed (But that is also why this game is in Early Access) However the developers are very dedicated, friendly and active on the forums and ingame, so there is already a very strong, very friendly but kinda small community in the game.The overall feel they are trying to make the game have is inspired by the games:Half Life, System Shock 2 and the Rainbow Six series. (they are aiming for a tactical and immersive shooter)If I should describe the game I guess the closest I can come to it is this:This game is what Aliens Colonial Marines should have been and Insurgency in space.So for an Early Access game, it is amazing and I'm really looking forward to see how this game develops in the future, I really have high hopes for this one :)			"

								Here's the conversation me and my friend had after playing a couple of games of IM:Dansrage: whats the point of this I can just play Insurgency lol Arthur Von Winklehammer: Right dude? Dansrage: let's go play play InsurgencyArthur Von Winklehammer: aha alright  Visually this game is quite impressive, excluding the endlessly copy/paste assets and environments, the lighting is nice, the weapon models are good, the rain on your visor is reminiscent of Metroid Prime, but there's just nothing under the hood.There are three game modes in IM, Campaign, Coop and Multiplayer. In campaign and coop you'll play on the exact same maps, with the exact same bots. There are minor variations of gametype that essentially boil down to ""kill all the guys"" or ""press all the buttons while you kill the guys"". This isn't bad in itself if the gameplay is engaging, but unfortunately it isn't. Bot AI will either run directly into your bullets or stand still and fire at you. The atmosphere with it's excellent sound design and moody lighting is obviously aiming for creepy, but all that ends up happening is that the four players fan out and clobber clueless bots, there's no tension, no real danger besides a bot spawning on you.  The multiplayer is just Insurgency with fewer guns, less varied maps and worse mechanics. It's a bog-standard twitch shooter with the supposed realistic weapon handling counting for nothing when everyone is hip firing in corridors at point blank range. All of the levels look like they're built from a single tileset as if they've been randomly generated. Everything looks the same.It's pretty much impossible to play with your friends, you can't create servers, the only way to host a private game is to set your preference to ""friends only"", and then try to join one of the seemingly random servers that pops up while it's still empty, hoping that it's the gametype and map that you want, and that you won't be instantly spawnkilled by somebody who wants this server for themselves. There's also seemingly no way to change map or gametype once you're in the server. This game uses ""Early Access"" as a blanket excuse for laziness, this game has been in development since May 2005.Think about that for a moment.TEN YEARS! It was originally supposed to release on PC and 7th gen consoles, this current version of the game that you're able to play today was Kickstarted in 2012, and is itself three years old.This is all they have to show for it. This is the game. If you think the core mechanics and gameplay will improve from here you're optimistic, I'll give you that, because three years of work has given us an ""Early Access Alpha"" with off the shelf shooting mechanics and about as much content as a Kinder Surprise. My bet is they're going to tack on more ""campaigns"" which basically amount to offline bot matches with text-to-speech voiceovers.			"

Early Access Review
								WARNING: THIS REVIEW REFLECTS MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE DURING THE ALPHA STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, UPDATE 12IT IS IN NO WAY A FULL PRODUCT REVIEW AND IT WILL BE UPDATED IN THE FUTURE AS THE GAME EVOLVESUPDATE: CHECK AT THE BOTTOM FOR UPDATE 10, 11 and 12!Interstellar Marines is a tactical shooter which aims to innovate several aspect of co-operative teamplay, and succeeds in doing so.While it's still in a very Alpha stage, (there's only one gun, the assault rifle, and there's only one game mode, king of the hill domination) it already started showing why this shooter brings something new to the table.In this game, your helmet is your UI. You take your helmet off, and you resign seeing tactical info like scoreboard, ammo, health, shield, teammate positions, next rank, and so on. The thing is it also gives you advantages. While using your helmet provides good info like that, it also muffles the sounds surrounding you, which makes it hard to hear if there's someone walking nearby. Also, when fighting in some scenarios with weather like raining or snowing, or while looking straight to the light, your sight will get blurried, either by the raindrops falling on your helmet, or because of the cold, or because of the light refraction. Also, your helmet will get dirty as you go through the map under different effects so it will get blurrier and blurrier. Taking your helmet off and putting it on at the right times gives you tactical advantage.Friendly fire is always on and at 100% damage rate, which is great because that is the way it should be.While the game currently lacks of many standard features like crouching and going prone, it already shows promise.CURRENT STATUS AS OF FEBRUARY 11, 2014PROS- Innovative helmet UI system.- Great settings, from storms to dark caves.- EXCELLENT, and I can't even begin to describe how good they are, SOUNDS. I mean, you feel like you're really there. I dare you stand under the rain in this game and not loving how it sounds when it falls on your suit.- Fair and balanced gameplay (seriously, the most balanced shooter I've seen so far).- Each match has several rounds changing the setting of the map (it can rain, it can become dark, it can be under a bright sunlight, it can snow, and all during a single match, making taking the helmet on and off something necessary).- Optimized engine, no FPS drops so far, while looking beautiful at the same time.- You can play with lag and almost not even notice it.- Shadows and body immersion is really good. You can see your own body looking below, and you can calculate if you're hiding well or not.- Great hitboxes. No refrigerator box here.- The best online community I have ever found around a game. No hate, just good people. Really, I've never had so much fun talking with people inside a game until playing this. I must congratulate every single one of you guys for being so awesome!CONS- No ducking at the time. (ADDED IN UPDATE 10!)- No proning at the time. (ADDED IN UPDATE 10!)- Only one weapon (assault rifle) at the time.- Only one gamemode (king of the hill team deathmatch) at the time.- Few servers (all official alpha servers) at the time. (ADDED MORE SERVERS IN UPDATE 10!)Is it worth its full price at the time? Nnnnn... maybe. I'd say wait before going full price on it.Is it worth purchasing in the IndieGala Bundle with the Beat The Average bonus? Yes. You should buy it that way.Will it be worth its full price in the future (if all goes according to plan)? Yes!Long story short: buy it discounted at the time, or wait a while until it gets better. But it's already showing stuff worth seeing. If you like tactical shooters, you should join their community group in the hub and keep track of its progress.  It may be just what you were looking for.______________________________________UPDATE 10 BROUGHT A LOT OF CHANGES!- Added jump.- Added crouch.- Better HUD.- Added new model for weapon (more hi-res).- Added more maps!- Added more servers.- Added more environments (wind and hard rain).- Added better lighting effects.- Added better reflections.Now it's worth its full price. Go get it!______________________________________UPDATE 11 BROUGHT NEW MAPS!______________________________________UPDATE 12 BROUGHT NEW GAMEPLAY!- Added new gamemode: capture points.- Added new weapon! Assault rifle w/scope.- Rain effects look better.			"

Incredibly immersive, the sound, lighting, and level design is top notch. Content wise, the game is slowly growing, with more multiplayer maps every couple updates, and more singleplayer every couple months.Eventually, the devs have promised (And I don't doubt they will deliver) a full co-op campaign, with RPG elements. Considering the game is already my favorite co-op experience besides Payday 2, I'd say Interstellar Marines could be THE co-op game for the next few years. The Dev's have Twitch broadcasts quite often, and are also very active on the forums. (At their website, not as much on steam)The game is well worth the $15, but I went all out and got Spearhead. I refuse to pre-order or buy early access to almost all games, but this is definitely worth it.Score: 8/10. Wins the Sorrowful Award for Legitness.Buy it now, or if you are hesitant, buy it on sale.Either way, you won't be dissapointed.			"

								While this game may be in early early alpha, it already shows signs that this is going to be AMAZING when it's finished. From what I've seen in the hour I played last night (going to do gameplay vid later) it has aspects that can be found in many classic games from the past, allowing players to be able to feel instantly familiar with it. On the other hand it manages to also add new elements that have never been seen before such as a mask with your HUD. Admittedly there are a few things that could be improved on at this point.. hit detection isn't the greatest - Especially when running. Can totally see this being a big game once it's finished properly - Already all the servers are near full! Try et!!			"

If you are undecided then wait for the next deal. Remember it is only the alpha version.

I also really loved the passion and love the devs have for this game -  it's almost inappropriate. I wanted to support that passion and see this game made. But here we are, no closer to it being a reality, and while I feel bad for the devs, I feel worse for the player base who are clinging on to the hopes this may ever be finished or a full game. At this point, some honesty from the devs probably is due. Are we hanging on for nothing?			"

								Although the Devs may take their time with game updates.  I'm grateful for the amount of content that has been released within the past few years. This gets me rather  excited for what is to come upon the next few months. Mostly because of the amount of game content that we have now is rather impressive. The game has multiple modes that such as Single player and  Coop campaign missions, Horde style game modes where players must defend off waves of killer robots,  and the standard multiplayer team deathmatch where players must take over control points in order for their team to win. (  think of it like the Conquest mode from the  battlefield games but on a smaller scale.)  And lets not forget that this game has a hunger games-ish gamemode where players are put against each other  in LARGE maps. The main idea is to be the last man( or woman) to  survive the hour long match. The graphics in this game is great to look at.  the lighting and the sound within this game is just drop dead EXCELLENT.  The sounds of gun shots make the feeling of shooting within the game feel meaningful.  the hunting rawrs the robots make when they spot you from a point of view. With so much good to be said about the game. it does come into some faults. One of the coop maps are bit bugged right now. its a bug that disconnects you from the coop map before you even play it. This game requires  a bit of heavy specs to play on if you want to fully take in the experience more smoothly. Overall, for a steam early access game its quite impressive to see how much content has been added and how much more will be added into the future. TLDR: 8.8 out ten.  its a great game but it is a bit of buggy and demands more Mid- high range  PCs to run.			"

								Feb 8, 2016I tried this game, really loved the environment.However, as it is PVP bent, it lost at least 50%, if not more, of its potential  market and audience. Sad really that the Developer, and many players, think MMO technology require forced PVP, as though the erroneous assumption of saving money is more important than having money to save...Without buyers of the game, meaning: people who love something about the game so much they'd pay for it and Developers showing respect for that by not forcing them into activities they didn't buy the game for, there is no money to be saved. That is the epicfail of Zeropoint by making the game so PVP based PVE players only see themselves as griefed after paying money. If not for a free weekend one time I probably would have bought this game and been even more ticked off about the situation, of course the Developer probably sees that as a ""winning tactic"" to get more money, the money their object not developing the game nor having a quality product in the gaming industry over the long-term.In most circles if you buy something and then it changes or is changed away from what it posed itself to be, that's called fraud, better known as ""bait and switch,"" and when the Developer hides behind the Early Access legal fiction AFTER taking our money, and uses this to not develop the game according to the market that has shown interest by paying money, if without intention that's incompetence and they don't deserve to succeed. However, as is usually the case, such as with Starforge, it is with intention and that's called Gross Negligence, which in many cases is tantamount to fraud legally.Point being, if the Developer has abandoned or is not making any effort to make the game appeal to the market, thereby securing the funds by profits from sales, funds they need to develop the game further, then whatever money they want is just stealing, irrespective of whether it's Early Access or not. Buyer beware is the axiom they depend on, which, if the company is actually trying to reach and grow their market is a reasonable idea, however, when the company exercises reckless abandon and utter failure to listen to those who've played the game, fails to pay attention to the cries for the game to be more appealing, and, fails to pay attention to how many walk away because the Developer thinks they can hide behind Early Access and ignore the players, then the entire idea of Early Access fails, and is merely a ruse to steal being taken advantage of by Con-Artists. Buyer beware is not an excuse to defraud peolpe of their money.			"

								""For the love of the game"" That covers it, a bold and rigid statement by Zero Point Software.Going through the demo's you can see where this game is going and how much effort and care is taken to ensure a proper bug free experience.Early release and i did not even counter one bug so far, it is just amazing.Then you start up the multi-player even though you are at the moment limited to one gun the experience as is, is really good.In it's current state it can already be seen as a proper game that works well and looks amazing.With recent updates a 2nd gun was added, a Assualt rifle with scope primerly for long range.The SMG has been tuned for medium to short ranges.In short buying this early access game will not disappoint any one with a appetite for FPS/Tactical games.Rating for this game is a defiantly a 10 out of 10!

								The game is ok, but kinda overpriced. This is an ""early access game"" so it has potential, but as of november 2014 it is not really that fun unless you have a bunch of friends with a copy to play around with. The single player campaign is slightly engaging if you like fighting in the dark, but it gets boring quickly and having no options to save makes you wonder why to even bother playing it.On sale for 10 bucks it is not too bad of a deal. but 19 dollars ? No.This game also has a rabid fan-boi following that likes to harass anyone that does not agree with them and would DARE to write a critical review of their most favorite game in the world.So now I can officially say that the community associated with this game makes it even less enjoyable to play.So in summation:  mediocre game with a community of opinionated ♥♥♥♥♥♥.

								I'd recommend this game. The more money these developers get, the better this game becomes. Ok there's a few peroblems I'll point out such as optimization. Yes, the game has frame problems due to it using the Unity engine. Yes, there's not that much on the game (like guns) but as I say, the more meny the better. The atmosphere when it comes to Co-op is excellent, I've also been told they plan on adding Snipers some time in the future.This game has lots of potential, I suggest buying it now so you get it cheap. :)They need to do a special offer where you buy it for £50 along with a few hundred pairs of pants.

Early Access Review
								EDIT: I did a bit of research after writing this and found that the game was actually announced *11* (ELEVEN) years ago.  That's right, this game has been around for over a decade and there still is nothing to show for it.  The most recent update as of May 21st 2016, rather than adding anything meaningful, added a new Main Menu UI and weapon skins, and the option to vote on what map you would like to play when your current round is over.  Two months for weapon skins and a new main menu.  Sorry folks but I don't think that asking for something other than that is very unreasonable at this point.  Please don't drop money on this until the devs have some actual, functionable content ready.I read a preview for the game I want to say around 6-7 years ago in the back of a magazine at the library.  It detailed what the developers wanted to do and how they wanted to do it.  Fast forward 6-7 years and so far we have a slightly above average multiplayer TDM/Domination game put together in Unity.  It's above average because they've obviously spent quite a bit of time and money putting the game together, there are some neat ideas in regard to how guns handle and how you move.  The sound design in particular is very well done, especially noting the differences when you play with your helmet on or off.  I purchased the Spearhead Edition for $45 on their website back in 2010 when I was back in college, back when the game was only playable in your browser and was only a few sets of target practice modes.  If the game had been released shortly after, even 2-3 years later, then it would have been fine.  However, that is simply not the case for Interstellar Marines.The bad parts are, like I mentioned earlier, that this game has been in development hell for what will be coming up on a decade now.  There has been numerous issues, engine changes, failed crowdfunding attempts, ""accidental"" key giveaways that gave people who purchased the game all of the special legacy upgrades that people who paid $40+ five years ago originally had (Spearhead Edition benefits).  They say the concept is to have an ""indie-AAA"" where the production values are AAA while being ""published by the community.""  This is absolutely fine, and it's worked for many other developers and games.  This title, however, has been in development for *years* and the only progress that has been made is adding a relatively uninteresting multiplayer component (You would be *very* lucky to find more than a dozen or so people playing, even on their ""Hell Weeks"") and a few uninspired singleplayer missions that revolve around you shooting robots, collecting a handful of keycards, and racing to the endpoint.  This would be fine, but the amount of content, and how ultimately boring it turns out to be, is just not worth your time.  The environments are nothing more than large empty hallways and open rooms, with a handful of fences and doors.  Nothing stands out, nothing is memorable.  The robot AI consists of them walking in a straight line and trying to hit you, but they're slow, which means you can easily kill them before they get close.  About 4 years ago they released a standalone ""museum"" type level that showcased a variety of enemies and environments, none of which have been seen anywhere else in any other part of the game.  The community essentially being dead is the big kicker at this point.  Whoever is left defending the title at this point seem to have a fixation on making sure that there is nothing negative ever said about it.  If you check Youtube, Steam communities, etc, you'll see quite a few people going on about ""FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME"", which is a phrase the developers came up with in regards to them developing a very generic coop military space shooter.  ZPS has done a phenomenal job of doing the bare minimum of development and making it out to be part of a massive game changing update.  I used to receive weekly emails that amounted to them saying:""UPDATE: Gun model revisions.UPDATE: Tweaked pistol soundsUPDATE: Added laser sigh, have fun ;)""It's kind of odd to say the least, the devs have been somewhat forthcoming and open about the development process, and they do stay in contact with what little people still have faith in them.  But beyond all that as I mentioned before you aren't going to find a lot of people playing the multiplayer, even during peak hours it's practically impossible to find a full match, don't even get started on trying to find one with decent ping.  All else I can really say is: It's your money, it's $10, the game has been in development hell for years and I cannot in good consciousness recommend that you spend your money on this.  At this point, it's not worth the $40, and it's barely worth $10.  If ZPS can somehow pull something major off then props to them, but the game is just vaporware.  I doubt I'll be able to get my money back since I purchased the game 7 years ago and I doubt they still have records that I bought the game in the first place.			"

								After some time playing the game and testing all its current features, Interstellar Marines is a game I cannot recommend at its current state. Its a very clunky, floaty, heavy work in progress. The game doesn't run that great, even with my 780ti. Runs at 60 sometimes, but drops to 30 at random locations for no reason.The sound design is pretty great for the most part but there appears to have a lot of gitches. Such as heavy breathing loop, audio cuts, and reverb in areas/senerios where it shouldn't be. EDIT* Sound problems are still as persistent as ever, seems that extended play will lead to that looping heavy breathing gltich. It also lacks content and reply value. There are plenty of maps to play in, but lack of good enough AI and or gunplay to keep it exciting.AI spot you across the map in dark sections of the map no problem and headshot you. AI run into walls, get caught on each other, glitch through stars. This game at its current state is not worth the buy. It carries nothing worth while or different from any modern first person shooter.Your better off playing Blacklight: Retribution, its essentially the same game just with far more content and its free 2 play (thought pay 2 win.)

								Guns:currently there are 2 guns to use: SMG and AR. the SMG has a lager magazine and is good for small-medium combat, while the AR is good for medium-long range. the combat and maps vary through the game, forcing players to use both weapons to get the most out of the game. Maps and Game modes: In multiplayer there is 4 game modes: deathmatch, team deathmatch, deadlock (deathmatch with capture points), and domination (one big capture point on the map). and there are 8 maps that work with all of these. the map types vary in size and location, and each game mode is fun in its own regard. there is 6 different co-op maps and a range of difficulties which drastically change the co-op gameplay. Player base:The game has a very small player base when compared to other gaming communities, this is both good and bad. there are less trolls in IM and active servers with experienced players can be fun, meanwhile alot of the time there might only be one active server. usually EU and US east are more active then the AU servers, leading to people always having a ping advantage, but there is server rollback to try and make this more fair, but it is always better on a closer server, like any game. Overall:interstellar marines is a fun, but sometimes seems repetitive (mainly co-op), it has enough content to back up the $20 price tag, and has alot of potential for a game that is still pre-alpha.

								As of now, this is a very simple game, but it's really fun. TL;DR at the bottom.Players have only two guns for different ranges of engagement (I find this is very balanced and works well, but they'll probably add more guns in the future). You have infinite ammo reserves, and your weapons have toggleable flashlights, quick attach suppressors, and laser aiming modules. Weapons are reasonably accurate regardless of aiming down sights.I played Survival mode, and I was really pleased with the emergent gameplay.In Survival, you and your co-op partners are put into a large urban/indoor area with objectives strewn around it. You just have to reach each objective to win. Each objective you reach will change the lighting and/or weather of the area, reducing or increasing visibility indoors or outdoors. Objectives can be reached in any order. Killed players can be revived immediately with the press of a button by a teammate. The main component of the gameplay is a steady flow of hostile combat training robots into the area. There are two kinds of robots: melee robots that sprint (really fast), and robots that use guns. Both types can kill you in 1-2 hits. You will usually die before you can react, so you have to listen for them and make sure you see them first. Robots will immediately see and shoot at anyone standing or emitting a source of light, such as a flashlight or light source in the environment. Good players will shoot out lights and use their flashlight sparingly in this mode. The gamemode encourages very tactical movement. Good players will practice sticking together, covering multiple angles, avoiding shooting at the same enemy, timing reloads properly, and entering new areas and rooms sensibly.The graphics are clean and simple, but are likely to be changed as development continues. There is heavy emphasis on atmosphere and lighting that really lends itself to the game, sometimes things get kinda spooky.The sound design of the game is impressive as it is; most of a player's information on how to proceed through an area will be from sounds far, near, muffled through walls, or in the same room.My only technical complaints about the game are the framerate instability and slightly high latency overall; the game is totally playable for me. The game is also a long time in development, it's a crowd-funded game before crowd-funded games were cool. It would be a great shame if the game was not finished. The core gameplay fundamentals are very solid and would probably be called ""hard but fair"" by a lot of people. It's certainly impressive by modern game's weak standards. The devs cite strong influences for this game: Half-Life, Rainbow Six 3, and System Shock 2. Each one of these influences shows. If the devs stick to their principles, this game can be a nice little pinprick of light in the darkness of recent FPS fare.TL;DR: I recommend trying this game, even in its current state. It's good challenging fun with friends, and despite its simplicity the gameplay does not get old quickly, which is very promising.			"

The main core of the game is the environment change, and by that I don't mean levolution (though it might be added (?), but I mean that the whole map could have the lights turned off, and so will do your suit systems. You will end up being in a dark and without any knowledge of who is who, so you'll be trying to figure it out and to remain hidden both, which is pretty fun. It might not cost this much money yet, but it sure will be while developed. Although it is avaiable for one dollar in a bundle, so grab it and test it by yourself!			"

								EDIT: The game is on life support, and that is if I'm being optimistic. It's a real shame to see what this game could have been go down the drain. Below is my review from when it was still alive, and not a vegetable. The game is still good, and you can play singleplayer stuff, but all of the multiplayer is empty... :(This is the best twenty dollars I ever spent. I cannot wait to see what they plan to add to this!THE GOOD:I really enjoy the fast paced gunfights and the slow, nerve-racking calm before them, as you sneak around killer robots in the Neurogen Incident, or just try to get the jump on another player in the versus modes.The multiplayer shines even with only 2 guns, each balanced for their roles perfectly, in my opinion.I have fun with the games singleplayer/CO-OP missions, even if there is only two, because the layout offers a few ways to go about each objective.To add to all this, the game is very immersive, all these small features that just add to the overall game very well such as: Exhaustion affecting aim, No automatic reloads, the ability to remove your visor when the helmet systems die, and even the way breath and rain can appear on your visor.THE BAD:I do have an issue with fps lag however, from all the dynamic lights and reflections and so forth, but its not impacting enough to detract from my enjoyment of the game.I do wish there was more enemies to fight than just a gun robot, and a crazy melee bot.Overall one of the best games I have played.

								It's a call back to the first FPS's that helped define the genre. You may here that this game sucks or its broken, but keep in mind it's still development. Plus, the people behind it are truly passionate and care about the game more than the money, always listening to the players and want they think. Get this game if you want something fun, balanced and has crazy potential.			"

								My second reviewI suppose the error in my thinking was that early access games weren't supposed to have problems. I will be the first to say sorry to the developers. This is actually a big sorry guys! You stuck to your promises and the game is shaping very nicely at the moment. I've yet to play any other game where relying on sound play such a big roll. The atmosphere in the game is tens and they never let that feeling of what is around the next corner go. I need to set the record straight and go with a thumbs up!!!!My first reviewRunning up and down stairs with nothing to shoot is not called single player, its called bad game design.			"

								In early access this game is severely lacking in features - only 2 different guns, a handful of maps and a control points gamemode that has replaced team deathmatch. Most of the servers are always, depressingly, quite empty. But still, it is a great game. The graphics are smooth, and, one of the best bits, the maps change during games - since the game is set in underground training chambers, the weather and lighting change from broad daylight to pitch darkness to rain and mist. This adds to the atmosphere, and when it's dark, the tension is racked up high, not knowing when you're going to run into an enemy and often too nervous to switch on your flashlight. Also, the gameplay favours tactical and careful movements instead of rushing straight in, which is a nice change from most FPS games out there.At the moment it might not seem like much, but as the developers update the game we are looking forward to new gamemodes, new weapons, and a singleplayer campaign. You should at least pick it up if it goes on sale. It's great fun and is going to become even more fun with future updates.			"

								This game is awesome. It has great atmosphere, the gameplay is solid and of course the Robots scare me (a lot!). So buy this game. Also there will eventually be sharks with legs sooo have fun!Edit: Due to a lot of bad reviews I wrote this long 'review thing' defending ZPS and IM, read it or not if you are going to bash IM and write bad reviews do more research on the company first, so many people I have seen just seem to copy/paste what other people wrote and just put the games reviews  even further in the hole when this game DOESN'T deserve it, this game deserves better.(Under is the review thing I was talking about.)4.5 years ago I paid money to a group of individuals saying one simple thing. ""We want to make a tactical Sci-Fi shooter"", Looking through the ideas and their history gave one implication throughout. THIS IS AN AMBITIOUS PROJECT. I understood this simple fact when I jumped aboard. I knew this would be ambitious, that they were trying to take an old genre with a lot of tropes and copy/pasted games and taking old tactical gameplay present in older games (Rainbow six is one that I can think of right now.) and applying it in a game series with 3 games with 4 player coop that impacted the game and to have each path and role be important, engaging, viable, and realistic. ZPS has been through financial difficulty in the past and they kept working to make their dream a reality, then people come along, the game gets some funds and the developers finally have the platform to release it on steam, start gaining higher levels of income for the game, they finally have a bit more income and start releasing updates. Then they release Hell Week, something that just didn't have the player base to really work, the levels looked awesome the infastructure was promising but due to this simple fact they started getting more and more negative reviews then they reach the ""mixed"" reviews section of steam. At this point they started losing funding, thus they had less money to make the game better, thus they had less game to make people happy, thus they had less people to give them resources. Then people start yelling and screaming that ""ZPS stole our money"" and that ""they bought coffee with our money"". I hate seeing entitled people yell and scream at a company I respect for a multitiude of reasons because they don't have enough game and don't understand and don't care to even look at and do research about the company's history, they just assume that ""Im not getting update, game is therefore bad."" I do not mean to devalue people's belief's and I believe people have a right to expect a game, but getting mad for supporting a company with barely any resources, while a company like EA takes Star Wars battlefront and monotenizes the crap out of it and gives less and less value with every release (If you like the game great, the gamplay was solid and the maps were well built, I am talking from an hourly content and payment required for ""everything in the game"") People should be mad at SW Battlefront for not ""giving as much content as SW battlefront 2"" (People are mad about that but SW battlefront still made so much money it doesn't matter.) And a company who are trying to create value get yelled at for being slow when they have next to no resources and next to no manpower. I support ZPS, I always will, I still believe and it saddens me not many people stand by me on this anymore.			"

								This game could be considered great if we were talking about a single-person developer doing this in their free time.  Why? It is a working multiplayer shooter that heavily relies on usage of superior team tactics to win matches - an organised team with voice chat will outmatch a team of ""super skilled pro players"" with each player doing his own thing. That's the good thing.The bad thing is, that nothing ever happens in term of updates. Every three to six months the developer team wakes up from their beauty sleep, decides what to do for the next hour, puts out massive walls of text praising the amazing new feature (even if it is just a single gun), and then goes back to sleep for the next three months. That would actually be okay if we were talking about a ""finished"" product, but this isn't a finished product. The way things stand, I can't see any intention of the developer to ever finish this game and implement any of the features promised originally. If you're okay with that and you want a small-scale, team-based, tactical FPS you can of course still go for it. You can of course have a lot of fun with this game as is. But don't expect the grand plan of the developer to happen within the next ten years...			"

It's still in a very early development stage even though it has been so for a few years.

								Game Score: 6/10 - 7/10Interstellar Marines is an excellent game (even though it is in pre-alpha) and looks like it will progress in a direction that is even better. As of this point, the game is drawing closer to a full release and the dedicated developers at Zero Point continue to deliver new content to the game. Visuals and Effects: The visuals on this game (especially for an indie company) are second to none. The particle effects on the rain on your helmet in game is almost realiztic on the highest graphics setting. The scenery (especially in the outside environments) is extremely detailed and well layed out, immersing you in the environment. One shining point of this game is the changing environment, one moment, it could be thundering and pouring. The next, it will be bright and peaceful (with the exception of the sounds of fighting). The lighting is well done and constantly changes. The visual effects of the guns firing is averageSound: Average sound effects, at this point, there are only a few death 'screams' that the Marines will emit upon dying. Gameplay: At this point in development, the game only supports a multiplayer platform. However, the dynamic environment adds so much content to the multiplayer. For example, you could be fighting in a well-let hallway then alarms will start blaring in your ears and the hallway will go dark. Forcing you to choose to use your flashlight or not, which would expose your location. There is a certain level of strategy you must employ when fighting in the ever-changing environment. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who loves a good and original FPS. The gameplay and visuals (especially the environment) are extremely satisfying and will continue to be improved upon by the developers at Zero Point Software.			"

It's on special at the moment too (dude, half price $7.49) so why wait? Get your copy today :D			"

								This is the right game for any one who loves Insurgency. There are some things to work out still, such as more guns and missions. However, the game is really reliable; it has only crashed for me once. Give it some time, and it will be an awesome game.			"

								One of my favourite games. I bought the spearhead edition three times (me, my sis and a third copy that's just lying around unclaimed) because I wanted to support the devs.This game is still in a pre-alpha state (i.e. there's still a lot coming) but it's already tons of fun!PROS:-Very dynamic maps (moving platforms, day/night cycles, lights that can be destroyed, doors that open/close) + they are beautiful-Basic implementation of the important stuff: crouch, jump, scope, laser, flashlight, shooting, etc.-The devs are really nice (you can sometimes meet them in-game, and shoot them!)-Updates are regular (every month or so) and of great quality (rather than quantity)-When near death part of the UI will go offline-Very tactical. This is totally not like COD or CS. Winning depends on every member of the team working together rather than a bunch of hyperactive cellar-kids punching their keyboard and mouse to death. Respawn rates are slow, and the only reliable way to get team members to respawn is by capturing points (or killing enemy players if you're the last man standing) this makes games very tense (unless the teams are unbalanced, ↓see below↓)CONS:-Only 2 guns (but more are coming!)-No melee.-No team balancing (has to be done by the players)-No way to kick people (but the players are nice, the only people I've wanted to kick so far were afkers)-No teamchat, voicechat or map/mode voting (it's rumoured these will be added in the next version)-Only multiplayer (so far, co-op and campaign are in the make) EDIT: one co-op scenario has been added a few days ago, although I like it, it's still the most buggy part of the game, I suggest you only play it if you don't mind losing because of invincible bots, random deaths, falling through floors and not knowing what to do. If you do mind, wait until the next update!IMPORTANT POINTS FOR NEW PLAYERS:-Only use your flashlight occasionaly, enemies can see it-Only use your laser when you're gonna use it, enemies can see it-Don't camp, you need to capture points to revive teammates. If you camp (for too long) you're letting your team down.-Keep together. Cover all entrances with your team. Try to flank enemies, force them into corners, etc.-If on your own, watch your back. You're never safe.-Use the SMG for close quarters and the rifle for medium to long shots.-Always. ALWAYS. ALWAYS use cover. There's a lot of it, and it will save your life.-Keep to the dark. When a point/doorway you need is in light, shoot the light. If you don't need to cross a light, don't shoot it. It can help you spot enemies or force them to take another path.-You can't disable alarm lights (red lights) by shooting at them.-Use night/dark to go offensive. As long as you keep to the dark snipers/campers can't spot you.-Don't shoot teammates. When your UI is down (because of damage) try to keep out of combat because it will be very hard to distinguish enemies/friends.It doesn't feel or look like a pre-alpha to me, so I wonder what the game will look like when it's finished.Apparently the next update is going to be a big one. So I'm really looking forward to that, I think it might be co-op. We'll see.			"

								It promised sharks with legs and cool survival mechanics.  Its been YEARS... and none of that has even remotely been added into the game.  Shame on you Zero Point Software.  Terrible, TERRIBLE effort in trying to make a good game.  Work hard and actually try to make something good.  This game is garbage.  Years ago i saw the trailer for this.  I saw land sharks and awesome guns.  Scary enviornments and dynamic maps.  But that is all just a dream.  This game is just a worthless dream.  DO NOT BUY this game.  I want a refund for the game.  But i cant get it because i waited too long to see if this game would become something.  Also the mulitplayer is dead.  SO RIP ANYWAYS.  Gaben let me refund this game.			"

								This game is really good, even in early access; It's better than a lot of games already out there(I'm looking at you, CoD Goats.) Although there isn't much to it yet, there's only one gun, and a few maps, not a lot of players either, but the server I played on had some really cool people. If you're into this sort of game, get it now, but if you're a filfy casual, I'd wait for more content to be realeased first.What is amazing though are the maps, there's different ""map modes"", where the map will change after a while, like rain, fog, night time, day time and a few other things. and when it's dark, oh christ is it dark. I can't wait to see what comes in the future.			"

								Interstellar Marines is a very good early access game. All you can do at the moment is run around empty maps or play online team deathmatch, though this feels like enough for now. The community I have encounterd so far has been pretty kind, which I do expect more from a game that I had to pay for. The game shows alot of promise, they just need to implement crouching. I am very happy with this game so far and I hope to see those ♥♥♥♥♥ing looking shark monsters in the not too distant future.			"

								This game failed to deliver on the initial premise that it was advertised with during its early sales, and the developers do not even admit to it. It became the same dull FPS it was promising not to be, and is also looking more and more like one of those typical Early Access games that was badly planned, and so it runs out of money and steam during development. Maybe check back in 10 years, given how slow progress on the game has become.			"

								Well this game may be a ways off in terms of delivering a single/co-op campaign but what it already delivers in terms of the multiplayer experience is an extremely positive sign.  The immersive nature of the environments really sets this game apart.  The moments when dark turns into light and you awkardly look around a room full of enemies are priceless.  Team play is the way to go and this game is highly recommended for any clans looking for some good tactical shooter action.  Plus - when the campaign lands you get land sharks.  'Nuff said.			"

								Keep in mind one thing before buying this game: This game is in Alpha. Ergo, it's not a finished product.Time of writing this review: 30/03/2014 03:10 AM (+0:00 GMT)I've been meaning to do this review for a while but now I felt I should do it now. Too save you from reading a giant essay on why I love this game. I love everything about it. The community is one of the nicest ones I've encountered, sure, there's teamkillers, but the community notifies one another about a teamkiller if he's ingame with them. The staff team (I've only encountered one and from my experience and the experiences from a few others) are extremely friendly and nice.This game ran on my PC which has a 3.7 GHz Quad Core AMD A10-6700 and 620 GT surprisingly well. Sure, I got 17-20 FPS, but I have to take in account that the game is in alpha, and more optimizations are to be made before the release of the finished product or the release of the beta. The gameplay itself is quite fun, a little slow paced but nothing too slow. You will encounter different dynamic enviroment changes and enviroments. There is rain which can affect your visibility by wettening the visor on your helmet. There's night time which makes you choose between sight and stealth and a few others. The game has a cover system as of Update 10 which is actually better than most game's cover systems in my unprofessional opinion. The gun's recoil is a bit.. much and can be a little frustrating when using the sight to aim down but you really have to fire in burst shots to get the most.This game is quite bug free and glitch free, in my entire month of owning the game, I've only encountered one bug. Which was a wall not being solid and letting the player walk through, could be abused if the wrong people find the bug. (Told the staff member I encountered about it)Tactics isn't really teambased as there's a lack of teamchat unless you're using Steam Chat and that's really it.A little side note: You will be seeing a load of players again and again. It's fun seeing players again and knowing how good they are.			"

								This game has great tactical fps gameplay. Clever usage of the silencers and the flashlight is a must. Though in early access, the game still feels pretty complete, packing in some replayable single player missions, co-op, and a unique multiplayer experience. The environments are well done, and change often, forcing you to adapt in order to survive. The Colony map even changes shape in between and during rounds, Maze Runner style. More awesomness is sure to come with future updates. If you like tactical fps games, I highly recommend this one.P.S. The game can be quite challenging in pvp or on higher difficulties. Be prepared for a licking until you get the hang of things. "

								*** WARNING: This review was written while Interstellar Marines was still in Pre-Alpha status, on November 27th, 2013! ***First things first: If you decide to support Interstellar Marines, make sure you understood what it means that it is an Early Access Title! You are NOT buying a complete game! You are supporting the developers to make their vision come true! Read the store page from top to bottom first.What you get so far when buying the Early Access version:- A single multiplayer mode, ""Domination"", with multiple servers for several regions available. 5vs5 and 8vs8 is available so far.- ""Playgrounds"": You can walk around the included multiplayer maps in Singleplayer. There is no goal, you are basically freeroaming the maps so you can learn their layouts without any stress.- Some tech maps for demonstration.- A single weapon with unlimited ammo (30 rounds/clip, with toggleable Flashlight, Laserpointer and Red Dot).- Almost completely bug and lag free game, but not much content.What's NOT available so far:- Singleplayer campaign/missions/shooting galleries.- Coop campaign/missions.- Melee.- Grenades.- Jumping (coming in a few days as I write this!).- Crouching.- A working HUD (only thing you see at the bottom are the remaining bullets in your clip, nothing else)Ok, now that we cleared that and if you're still interested to hear about Interstellar Marines, let me put it this way:Interstellar Marines does not try to be a carbon copy of any large sale franchises which currently exist, like Battlefield or Call of Duty. The developers of Interstellar Marines, Zero Point Software (or ZPS, for short), are some die hard gamers themselves, probably remembering the ""good old times"" of FPS, which are definitely over today.Playing the multiplayer part of the Early Access version feels very different to those AAA big budget titles released today. One thing which is a very positive thing and a very important one for me personally, is the netcode. I adjusted the network smoothing slider in game all the way to the left, and Interstellar Marines is basically lag free. Something you usually don't find in AAA titles today. If you own Battlefield 4 for example, you know what I'm talking about. Of course Interstellar Marines has the occasional hick up here and there, but that's probably due to the connection of the other players. At least for me, if I experienced lag, it was coming from the same players usually.My own internet connection is pretty slow, but stable. I have a DSL3500 connection with an average ping of 50ms. And like I said, lag free in this game. I usually play on the ""All maps (EU)"" server.To describe the smoothness of the network code, the last titles I remember to be that smooth were Unreal Tournament (the original one from 1999!), Quake 3 or Counterstrike (not Source, I mean the old one). So if you're an old school gamer like myself and remember at least one of the titles, you know what you're up to. If you have a good aim, you'll hit your enemy. Easy as that.The overall graphics so far are not top of the line of course, but the lighting effects definitely are. The dynamic lighting in the multiplayer maps (remember: all environments are deeply underground in a training facility, with artificial weather, lighting etc.) is creating a tension at night it's mind blowing. I love this! To orientate, you can switch on your flashlight for a short time, but don't use it constantly because it's basically a ""shoot here"" indicator for your enemies.The performance is great for me, but I got a beefy graphics card. I have all ingame settings maximized, and I get 100+ fps at all times. I'm using a five years old rig with a modern graphics card:Intel Core i7 920 @ 3,6GHz6GB DDR3-1600nVidia GTX770Considering the overall pace of the gameplay, it's quite fast so far. I know ZPS are aiming for a more tactical gameplay like in the very good ""Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield"" (never played this game? Go get it!), but it is significantly faster than this right now, but it certainly will change as the game progresses. Playing Interstellar Marines in this current version feels a little similar to Counter Strike Source to me, minus the flashbang, grenade and AWP madness. But don't be fooled, Interstellar Marines has another feature which is, at least in my opinion, outstanding:The sound (engine)!Interstellar Marines allows me to pinpoint the exact location of an enemy if he's giving away his position by making some noise, either by shooting, sprinting or falling off e ledge and landing on the ground. I have a good old 5.1 sound system connected to my dedicated sound card (Creative X-Fi Titanium), and it's been a long time I've been able to tell the exact direction of where a sound came from in a computer game. Doom 3 comes to my mind. So if you're sprinting around too much, people will know exactly where you are and can react accordingly. I love it, love it, love it!One other thing: So far the community does not go into the 100.000s, so don't expect to see a dozen full servers online. We are not there yet, but lately there was usually activity at any time on the EU server.Read a little more about the game and learn where ZPS wants to go with Interstellar Marines, ask questions about it here in the steam forums and decide if this is for you.If you are fed up by annual releases of big franchises with little to no innvations, tons of bugs, lags and bland gameplay, Interstellar Marines could be for you. It will grow and become even better, and so far I'm already having heaps of fun with it in it's very early stage.If you expect explosions every few seconds, choppy controls, a short campaign with little gameplay, boring script events and an absurd storyline for three times the price, there are better titles out there for you.I prefer to support Interstellar Marines though. Without a big publisher, ZPS can concentrate to create the game with a different aim: To make it the game they want, to maximize the fun. Publishers are forcing their developers to maximize only one thing: Revenue, no matter the cost (lack of fun).Support Zero Point Software! Support Interstellar Marines! For the love of the game!

								Overall a great game what people don't understand is the updates may come a little slow and they don't have any money. I beleive that is the only reason this game is getting bad reveiws and it hasn't blown up.The combat is realistic for a futuristic shooter and offers a completely diffrent style of gameplay than any other game I have played. The game is opmimized and I was able to sit at a stable fps most of the time even a crap computer can run.			"

								I bought a 4 pack a couple years ago when it was on sale because it looked like it would turn into a pretty cool co-op game. I don't think they've added any new content to the game with the exception of being able to reskin your marine.Deffinetly not worth it, I don't think there's anyone activley working on the game anymore, which is a shame.

Early Access Review
								This game has the potential to be one of the best, most memorable sci-fi simulators. Unlike most early access games, this is one perhaps truly deserving of attention and in desperate need of funds. IM is one of only a handful of other early access games that I can think of truly in development, and it shows. It has a few place holder items at the moment, that in due time will be replaced. And, unlike almost any other early access title, IM is funded only by your own, and my own patronage - and perhaps the only one not funded by a kickstarter. This game doesn't happen without purchased copies or, if you have an account on the IM website, through small $5 donations. If you don't have an account, but still want to support this game, perhaps without purchasing or lacking enough funds to purchase a copy, go to the Interstellar Marines website, create an account, and make donations here and there. Every little bit helps.			"

								♥♥♥♥.----------------------PROS-----------------------Gunplay. Weapon handling is fantastic. Feels very nice. All the guns feel as they should, though they are few in number. Hit markers point out exactly where you hit on the enemy (more on this in the hud section.) Realistic-ish wounds make them feel as powerful as they should be. Fast paced, react or die mechanics are very enticing.-Hud. The hud is everything you want it to be: good checkpoint markers, fantastic hitmarkers, good scoring module, and fitting colors. It feels very immersive as it gets taken away the second you take off your helmet.-Atmosphere. It's not perfect, but it is certainly a plus. Massive lack of light forces you to rely on your flashlight, surroundings, and mopre importantly, your foes' flashlights. Fantastic scenery immerses you in dark dead space stations and militeristic complexes.-Character design. You are the fist of humanity, crushing aliens, robots, and even other humans that stand in your way. Think of beefed up SWAT in space.-Immersion. Like I said before, this game is very immersive. All your gear is cleverly made to hide the fact that it's a game. The HUD is entirely linked to your futuristic helmet, guns are attached to you via magnetic holsters on your legs and backpack, even the map will be implemented on a wrist-mounted pda. The radio is also pretty darn realistic sounding too.-Promise. The game itself has a bright future, IF it is finished. Mor on this in cons, friends.----------------------CONS-----------------------Development. It's slow. Crawling speed slow. There is only one active dev, though he's incredibly dedicated. Updates take months to come out, and the game itself is struggling to get the needed funding. I pray it's finished.-Content. Yes, it is an early access, but the game is lacking replay value. Two coop missions, some survival, and PVP matches. I really can't wait to see those landsharks in action. Yes sharks with legs, look it up. They cool as flip.-Players. They are nice, but they are few. Very few players make matchmaking a nightmare. Speaking of which...-Servers. There is no hosting a server. Just a warning, as playing with randos will happen. If you're lucky, that is.----------------------TLDR----------------------Fantastic concept and a beautifull future if it gets there. PLEASE just help it get there, friends. Zero Point NEEDS you to help.FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME.			"

Early Access Review
								Interstellar Marines is a tactical FPS in which two teams of marines are pitted against each other in an underground simulated environment.  Some very unique features of this game include the almost immediate death and the weather mechanics.  This is a game in which the old run n' gun technique will almost always get you killed.  Often the best strategy involves using a suppressor and sneaking around until you can ambush your enemies.Some subjective and personal positive aspects to the game I have noticed are:Losing your HUD once you take a certain amount of damage.  In this game's multiplayer it is nearly impossible to tell friendly soldiers from your enemies without the use of your HUD.  The feature which temporarily removes use of your HUD makes being wounded even more frantic because when you turn to run you need to look twice to make sure the marine behind you is friendly.A feature which closely accompanies the loss of your HUD is the ability to open your helmet.  By pressing ""H"" you are able to completely disengage your display and open your helmet.  This comes in handy when it is raining because the rain will obstruct your vision by sticking to your visor.Operable doors.Most FPS these days have decided to remove the idea of operable doors in their multiplayer modes.  I beleive that it is a strong suite for this game they have not decided to do that as well.  When opening a door on a map such as Dynacore you can't tell if some one is hiding on the other side.  Doors are also very useful as cover from enemy fire.  It also adds a degree of realism and dynamic gameplay.Weather/Day night system.This game has fully dynamic shadows and a weather system which has been expertly fleshed out.  You have different weather conditions from rain to snow to high winds.  The rain will greatly obstruct your vision while your helmet is down. The snow reduces visibility in general and plays tricks with your mind because of the movement. The winds add slightly more chaos to the area however are likely the least influential of the three.The day and night rotations are incredibly important in any game of Interstellar Marines.  In the day time you have only a very small chance of successfully hiding.  In the dusk and at night you will have a much easier time at remaining concealed.  You will also learn that the use of a flashlight is unadvisable to say the least.  The dynamic changes in weather and time force players to change their strategies whenever the map decides that it got bored.Lastly, the dynamic motions of elements in the maps.Many of the multiplayer maps have different structures of elements within the maps themselves which will periodically move.  This will force players to change their routes and hiding spots as hallways are cut off and buildings rise into the air and sink into the ground.Now for what I dislike about the game in its current state.  Please be advised everything listed below is subject to change.  Alpha = AlphaThe game has very few weapons at the moment.I am personally very happy learning to use two different weapons proficiantly.  But for those of us who want more variation you may have a hard time excepting the lack of variety in your choice of weapons.  On top of this there is only a few small differences in the way the two current weapons handle.  The Rifle has more accuracy over the SMG but it quickly loses that with sustained fire.  The SMG has an additional 10 rounds over the Rifle bringing it to a total of 30.  It also has iron sights with a much lower magnification that allows it to be used in close quarters combat, as opposed to the 4x scope on the Rifle.  However besides these small differences the guns are essentially identical.Movement system.Although perfect in almost all situations, the movement system has its flaws.  The devs have nerfed sprinting and jumping by forcing you to start panting after a certain amount of either running or hopping about.  My concerns with this mechanic in its current state are as follows; Jumping rarely allows you to overcome an obstacle the first try.  After your second or third attempt you begin panting for as long as 20 seconds afterwards.  In multiplayer it can also get tiresome when you are trying to catch up with your team on the map Evacuation and you start to pant, then you encounter and enemy and your crosshair is bouncing all over the screen.Early Access.The game is currently in development.  Listen to me when I say that this game is in EARLY ACCESS.  That means when you buy it you are admitting that this is the product you want in its CURRENT STATE.  Although I think this game deserves all the support it needs to have a successful launch, you must understand that there is no guarantee it will ever be released, and there is no guarentee there will ever be another update.  If you decide to spend your money on this game, I would say its worth every cent.  But at the same time you must make certain you want this game and not the Interstellar Marines that you are thinking about 5 years down the line.Please remember this is a preliminary review of an early access game which is subject to change.  Before perchasing you should look at other reviews and perhaps some video coverage of it online.Thank you,AviatorFox			"

Early Access Review
								As of this writing, on the startup screen this game is identified as ""early access"".   The single player gameplay is kinid of old school with very limited story and repetitive fairly plain levels and graphics. On the upside the game seems to run smoothly and the engine is ver responsive and seems well suited to a twitch and shoot. I should mention that I generally don't do multiplayer, or co-op, so can't comment on those modes.  This review is only about the single player mode.  Something that is kind of surprising is that so far in the first two levels, the only enemies are these dumb robots that seem like they are modeled after the ""droid"" soldiers in Star Wars.  The have a similar metalic voice and the AI is kind of predictable, and a little clutzy and, well, dumb-- just like in Star Wars.  From the title, ""Interstallar Marines"" I was expecting some aliens or maybe a race of militant humanoids like in Kill Zone.  But, no joy-- all lyou get are these dumb robots.As dissppointing as the robots are, a larger weakness is that there currently seems to be no way to save progress.  What this means is that if you are killed on a level you have  to start over from the beginning.  This is especially painful when almost at the end of a level.  After playing the first level  for about a half hour, and almost ""exfiltrating"" the compound, I was killed at the last moment (by a dumb robot who didn't die even after I emptied a full clip in hsi stupid face).  The thought of having to start from the beginning was too unpleasant to contemplate, so I quit and played a different game --one with a way to save progress.So far this game has single player potential,  and I like to support Indie developers.  If you wnat to support development then spend a couple of bucks on this early access, but don't expect too much from the single player mode at this  point-- my guess is that the single player mode is more of an after thought with little focus or effort from the developers.  Hopefully there will be an improved single player update soon.			"

								Reviewed after update 23Gameplay: 300+ hoursCool game mechanics:-Realistic gun recoil -Exhausted?  You will find it harder to aim, your heavy breathing will make it harder to hear also.-Hearing is just as important as seeing.-Minimal hud but still full of tons of information, however it deactivates when your suit is damaged.-That light giving away your position in the dark?  Try shooting it out-React to conditions and accept consequences dynamically.  Silent enviroment? Players/bots will hear you running.  Dark Enviroment?  Players/bots will see your flashlight.  Solo/Coop:-Solid AI, very well done.  Have fun tricking robots into looking behind boxes that they thought you ran behind.  Have fun getting mad when they see your muzzle flash/flashlight from across the map (just like you can).  They have similar restrictions as the player including health.  A fun challange to play on realistic.  -Good assistance and teamwork mechanics.  Its easy to feel hindered when you have a bad team, in fact it is usually easier to play alone than with a bad team.  However with a good team you can cut through maps like melted butter.  Things like needing a teammate to watch your back or cover you while you reload actually can be quite benificial.-Level design and attention to detail.  Some of the best installation designs I've seen in a game.  Can be a bit overwhelming at first, just like if you walked into a real military research base or commercial space station.-Only a few weapons but they are well done and feel right.  Feels like a soldier getting a standard loadout.Multiplayer:-A dynamic training enviroment where the enviroment can wildly change from brightly lit to hurricane condtions to pitch black.  Very fun and totally changes the way the match is playing.-Want to run and gun?  That is okay but deal with the exhaustion and inability to aim well.  Want to run around with a laser sight (which acts as a crosshair) then be ready to give away your position.  There is no wrong answer to tactics, just results.tl;dr:This game is fun and enjoyable.  Get to watch a single person take out a whole team using stealth in the dark.  Watch people complain that stealth has no purpose. 11/10 would play again. "

								Such an awesome game! Seriously! Give it a try. I have been following this game since it was on the internet as a unity engine web game. Even than it had amazing graphics and sound! This game has a horror side to it as well as a pure combat side. I would rate it 9/10 easy. The co-op is fun, the AI is extremely smart, the weapons feel good, and the graphics.. well the graphics are AAA quality... They are phenominal. ..... on a side note this game gets extremely scary when you're alone in a building and you can hear the robots stomping extremely hard on the floor above you with you knowing full well that they are hunting you. And oh why do the robots hiss? Its terrifying, especially when they are melee ones and they sprint at you.			"

								The road to [development] hell is paved with good intentions. I've seen my fair share of early access cash grabs, and this game had some of the most exciting and enticing broken promises of them all. To me it doesn't really matter whether the devs meant to disappoint us, they promised a game and we gave them money for it, and now the project is out of funds and dead in the water. Color me an optimist for not getting a refund, but I would not recommend this purchase for anyone but the extremely bored, or those who feel like they just have too much money lying around.			"

								Think Aliens, crossed with Arma.Kind of what that other AAA aliens and marines based game could have/should have been if it wasn't a load of old ♥♥♥♥. Now I know it's been in development for a long time, but it has been developing - albiet not as fast as some users according to several reviews on here.. But that has to be the only negative for the game though. The gun play is excellent, even with only a few weapons in the game, they're so well done and work so well in their respective uses I personally don't miss having a variety of rifles or SMGs or rocket launchers.. The lore of the game so far is that you're in a training facility under the Nevada desert, so there doesn't yet need to be many kinds of rifle or whatever else. The use of either Pistol, AR or SMG is fine enough for the current lore of the game.And that HUD! I've yet to see a better implemented HUD; properly a part of your helmet's visor - with the option of raising the visor on your helmet to maybe see better in the rain or fog, at the cost of losing your HUD altogether. Such immersion, I haven't seen this done so well before. PVP is very well done, akin to DayZ/Arma; tactics and positioning are everything.Teamplay and moving from position to position, hugging the walls, keeping in the shadows, makes the difference between winning or losing. Sprinting about trying to run and gun will only get you so far, that is not very far at all! The multiplayer maps are all excellent, from cramped storage facilities with ledges and corridors (reminds me of laser quest as a child) to open spaced maps with water, fog, thick undergrowth and hiding places galore.. The simulated sunny/rainy/day/sunset/night cycling of the 'training environment' that the matches are held in constantly adds new elements to your fight. Co-op matches are also good, the AI can pose a very real threat, although still no land sharks or aliens as yet. The missions are good - clearing a map of hostiles, infiltrating a facility, sneaking round and picking off sentries while vastly outnumbered and so on. But I have to be honest I mostly play for the PVP. As things develop and the game gets further along its trajectory  and original aim of co-op teamplay I can't wait to get a team together to see what bug infested space hulks we could explore ;)So I do highly recommend; no it might not fill several hundreds of hours just yet (though some have got thousands of hours on their profiles) all the same for the small price tag and the huge potential, it has to be a win. It's less than the price of a couple of pints these days. How can you possibly go wrong. (I've been waiting two years for a different dev team (with millions € behind them) to add zombies back in to their zombie survival game, surely this small indie team of devs are worth waiting on to get us our aliens and land sharks sorted ;) )Stay frosty people.

Early Access Review
								This game is the reason why I don't like the Idea of early access.  The whole point of Early access is so that you can support the game you want while its in development.  When in development the goal is usually to make a rough wireframe of the game.  As everyone knows, you can't edit and refine what doesn't exist. However, this team doesn't know this.  They have forgotten what their goals were for this game.  They have been making small updates forside content which is (usually) suppose to be second to the main content.  They seem to want to appease players with small updates so that they can forever have a stream of money, with no effort involved.  This game will most likely not ever be completed, and having bought the game I am severely dissappointed in them.  What they have made so far has nothing to do with anything they had promised me when I purchased.  Years will pass by and almost no progress will be made.  It will most likely be dropped into the abyss called canceled project, if they haven't quit already.In a few years this game will be forgotten, and nobody will miss it.			"

								IMPORTANT NOTE: This is only for the Early Access content as of August 2014. My rating is subject to change once more is added.The Review: ISM is very lite on content, to me. It has a couple multiplayer competitive maps, and a early demo for Co-op mode where you and a friend kill robots while trying to reach the roof. 2 guns, no grenades or customization or any other weapons, not even melee. The 2 guns are both Assault Rifles with emphasis on different engagement ranges. I see the potential for an amazing game, but right now it's just too simple. The lighting adds a good layer to the game, as well as the decision to use a laser and give away your position in return for better hip aiming. It seems you can take off your helmet but this currently seems to have no effect other than removing the hud; I assume this will result in your suit powering down (no lights) eventually, but it's not the case currently. In summary: If you are you are interested in their concept, get this on sale maybe. I got it in a Humble Bundle and don't regret it. But if you want a good game to sink hours into, I don't see it happening here, yet. Keep an eye on ISM though, I do expect it to become awesome eventually.			"

Early Access Review
								Sharks. With. Legs.(Early Access Review 26/07/2015 Update 20 Unity 5)Interstellar Marines is rich in story, development story firstly.This is a game that was originally created in the Unreal Engine at the wrong side of the economic crash.The outcome? A bankrupt studio and no way of affording the price of the then current Unreal pricing model.So what did they do?Give up?Of course not!They just shrugged it off and started in Unity Engine.20 updates later and here we are at the Unity 5 update.So what is this game all about in its current state?What will it be like when it is finished?Will it even be finished?Why does everyone keep talking about sharks?Is the IM community really that awesome?Currently the game is all about the multiplayer, the single player and the co-op and most recently it is all about hellweek.Multiplayer is fun, difficult, tense and frantic.Single player is unnerving, tense and atmospheric.Co-op is fulfilling and to be honest, a worthy challenge.Hellweek is ambitious, sometimes cruel and unique.When finished IM will probably be the best science fiction fps and I would go as far as saying it will probably be the bar that all other sci-fi games are judged on for single player story going forward.Not even bankruptcy can put IM down so it seems safe to say that this game will get finished.Sharks are scary enough at the best times but these abominations have legs. Have you even considered how scary it would be to get chased down in first person by a great white sprinting at you?Some say that the IM community is the best community by far, all I know is that a game is only as good as its community when it comes to games with multiplayer.I've been vague on this review, but just wanted to add more and keep building on it so it's the start.

								Played this game a year ago. Enjoyed it but decided to move on until it was finished. A year later, it's abandoned and unfished. Why does steam allow developers to get away with this? It's not fair to consumers who decide to support the project but instead end up throwing away their money to a worthless project. I am done with early access projects. Should've learned my lesson with Day Z five years ago.			"

								I don't get scared easily. The Shining - unfazed; Paranormal Activity - nothing; Friday the 13th - I forgot that was supossed to be scary. I can't think of any other way to tell you, I just don't get scared. Until this game. Assualt on Starcrown Aerospace had me crapping my pants in fear. And the Neurogen Incedint? I don't even want to hear those words anymore. This is the scariest thing I have ever experienced. And I loved every minute of it.			"

								The game certainly has potential, but the same can be said about a lot of titles that have not delivered what was promised.  While graphically pleasing, the game currently lacks what I consider to be any decent gameplay.  Multiplayer death matches are pretty much all you have to look forward to if you buy this game which is *not* worth the money in my opinion.  With these things in mind I will point out the pros and cons of this game as best as I see them. Pros:(The graphics are more than I expected and makes the game look quite believeable.(Weapon performance is surprsingly good, with the sounds and recoil reminding me of actual rifles I have fired.(The heads up display mixed with the toggle modes on the helmet makes me feel like my head is actually in the helmet, which reminds me somewhat of the metro series.  This is a great immersion modifier.(The dynamic weather system the have in the arena is very well done and they demonstrate that they can develope immersive environments within their game.Cons:(While the devs have multiple ""gamemodes"", all of them occur within an enclosed arena which, for me, gets dull really fast.  Again, the lack of gameplay variety just ruins this for me.(Next to no visible progress on this game.  I understand the time it takes to develope such things but their updates  are both irregular and sparse.  I see no indication that this game is going anywhere fast.(Lack of player customization leaves me feeling like a stormtrooper with no identity.  This breaks the immersion greatly in my mind.Overall I'd say that this game has the barebones framework that can be the foundation of something awesome, but sadly I don't believe it will be.  As I said, I see no noteworthy progress on the game and with that fact alone, I don't reccomend buying this game.			"

								ok. I LOVE this game. now, don't let me make you think that it's a good game, it can only appeal to certain people.If you're a person like me, who loves immersion (mostly the fact that your helmet is ACTUALLY right there in front of you) mixed with action (shooting insane robots in the face) with a touch of survival horror (being afraid, because damage is realistic), then you'll love this game. HOWEVER, if you like cod's gameplay over what I listed, then you probably won't like this.Now, watch some trailers, gameplay, look at some images, do whatever you have to do, but in my opinion, this game is amazing.Now, I do not play this game a lot, I actually played it twice so far, and I don't usually play the robo missions, I play multiplayer versus. The robots are too damn spooky. Some people love the robots, and I do too, just I can't find what reason I like playing multiplayer versus more than robo missionsI guess it's because I don't like having to restart, but even then, I also don't like waiting to respawn (cuz revenge).the gameplay? awesomethe mechanics? awesomethe bugs? only a few, and sometimes it said ""press space to spawn"" presses space, jack ♥♥♥♥ happenskeep in mind, this review is posted while it is still in early access, however, there aren't really any gamebreaking bugsfinding a server? this is the one that I had semi- trouble with, because there was at least 100 servers, and there were literally 4 servers with pleople in it.

								A game that encourages memes to promote itself. Truly, you can't sink any lower than this. I did support it in the beginning before they started using these marketing methods though. Maybe we'll see half of what's promised in 2022. Just so you know the updates are far inbetween and don't bring much.But keep the faith. What they promised looks great, and if this comes through my name will be in the credits.I give it:""My Retirement"" out of 14.Essentially it's a tech demo as of now, no gameplay to really speak of.

								I've been following this game, for a few years; basically I seen mutant land sharks, and well I am still left waiting for it. Lets be honest this game is early access but its good, the basics are there, and the shooting omg, I havent played a game that I feel like Im actually hitting where I aim. Perhaps many will say its unrealistic as there doest seem to have any variation of flight, but damn it feels good to know you as the player are on point.  Where is the game now? Well, its playable with a some bugs that are easily repeatable but nothing that breaks the game. There are 7 maps, and really it doesnt seem like much. And once you clear them all with you group of friends its hard to go back to them. And you will need friends, this game can be hard and failing is a part of it, but with a full group of friends there are alot of tactics to try in all the maps  in all the modes. It just feels like there isnt enough game yet, esp with updates so far between eachother. The online server chooser needs to be fleshed out a bit, currently a slight pain to get a game going, but not hard either, just missing some nicities. So for me and my group, there isnt enough yet for us to buy into I.M.'s Early Access yet. BUT if an update adds the sharks and give me some LAN play, I'm all in. It just need a bit more.			"

								10/10 a 'demo' with great potentialI'll make this brief and simple and to the point, okay?OkayInterstellar Marines is a game that I found, upon playing it, has a wonderful amount of charm and potential. Yes, the weapons are currently limmited to the standard SMG and the Assault Rifle, and yes, there's not a whole ton of REAL missions in the singleplayer (by REAL I mean The NeuroGen Incident and the Starcrown Assault), which brings me to my main point of the game.It's not finished...When I look at this game, I think of it as more of a Singleplayer/Muliplayer/Co-Op, tactical, space, first person shooter demo.So if you want to buy this game, I say 'Go for it'.Just keep in mind that this game is unfinished, and that I cannot be held responsible should anything go to crap, okay?OkayP.S. If you've made it all the way down here, I appreciate it, and will let you know that you can find both Valve and 20th Century Fox references within the NeuroGen Incident. Simply listen closely to the station's announcement system, and you'll find them :3			"

								Interstellar Marines is a very good first person shooter game. I am tempted to say it is one of the best I have played, but I have played many FPS games and so it would be  kinda hard to say it was one of the best. For an early access game though, it is amazing. The developers really seem to pay attention to every little detail to make the game immersive, tactical, and most of all playable. I say ""playable"" because some early access games may have alot of bugs/glitches, but Zero Point has done a great job of getting down to business and making the game very fun. I am looking forward to the future updates, and eventually the final release. this game is definately worth getting!			"

								From what I played, this game is goregeous. It doesn't really rely on online multiplayer team vs. team combat like most FPS nowadays. You can play singleplayer missions, co-op with a few friends, and if you really want to, you can play multiplayer. Visually, it's stunning. The effects on the visor are new to sci-fi shooters and really haven't seen that done before. I didn't get my chance to try out multiplayer against other players quite yet, and don't think I'll get the chance for a while. Although this game is fantastic, and is different from the many shooters that it's in the market against, it lacks one thing that might make this better for us, not so rich people that can't afford to buy a gaming pc. A graphics tab. It does have the v-sync, etc. stuff, but I maybe want to lower some of the quality to medium instead of always being on high. For laptop users, like myself, this is a big issue that we have to deal with. I'm not saying my laptop is terrible graphically or anything, but a graphics tab, visual quality slider could be useful to many players. Other than that, this game is fantasic and hell yeah I recommend it to a friend!			"

 Awesome game The devs managed to combine the feel of a tactical FPS and the atmosphere of a Sci-Fi horror game. Multiplayer and co-op is frustrating yet fun. Has a campaign mission but only has 2 weapons currently. The Problem The ping is unstable and i managed to find a server glitch where the match is only 4 seconds long and then 'no winner is found', and it keeps repeatating. Respawn time is too long and it made lots of people rage quit (should be 60-70 sec instead of 100+). Conclusion Interstellar marines a good tactical FPS game in its own rights, it's spooky and challenging. I highly recommend this game for FPS/Sci-Fi horror fans and for those who seeks challenge and frustration.			"

								I like the game, I see that it has the potiential to be a fun game, but it needs some improvements. Like they should add in game currency so you can buy the attachments for your weapon because most of us feel that it gives us a sense of achievement in getting that item. They also should add a secondary weapon which would make it funner as there seems to be only one weapon in the game. Combat felt a bit dull but i think it still was pretty fun. They also should add Co-op like with the sharks/ legs on because that seems to be what the game is for.but i think this is still a great game.9/10Edit:10/06/2014 The game just had the first co-op come out and man I got admit even though they where robots, it was dark and creepy, i hear that thump thump thump whack and i start fireing without aiming. dam its like does have a creepy feel in single player think i going to get a few friends and that may make it a lot more fun and hopefully less creepy.

								I really want to get this review right as I REALLY want you to buy this game that is how much I recommend Interstellar Marines! Even if you buy it now and don't like it, which you would have to be crazy not to, this will be an investment. Simply because Interstellar marines is a game to watch, with a ton of future potential and that future isn't far off.The game, as it is, puts you in the boots of a Marine undergoing training in preperation for combat missions that will take you to the furthest reaches of human expansion in the universe that will lead to first contact with other intelligent life in a very realisitc way.The developers are fantastic, dedicated, imaginative and have in my opinion (and I know this is a review) have given to us as customers the most brilliant concept for a game I can concieve espically the way they have implemented dynamic environments. When the lights are on you walk about like you own the place but the dark corners you still avoid, when they go out completely you hide in the corners edging along walls frightened to turn on your flash light because the dark just seems so vast because when all the lights go out it really is pitch black and the dark feels real. The weather is also diverse with rain that falls on your visor obscuring your vision really giving you a sense of presense and depth like no other game offers. The weapons feel like tools of war rather than cap guns, the sounds of your boots on the floor make you concentrate on moving forward, the only sound this game is missing to make you feel alive is the sound of your heart beating but then you might be able to hear it but I could not over the sound of my own. The graphics are impressive when you can see and when you can not. If you look outide at the stars you get a sense of loneliness that not many games give you that take you to space but that might have something to do with what is waiting for you inside. The jungle like environment on one map even though it covers only one half of the map is amazing with a great sense of being in a real life jungle which at times is like being in the dark because all you see is different shades of green.The AI is the best I have ever experienced, even when compared to arma because the AI in interstellar marines is way more intelligent they react to light, the environment and when they are fired upon. If you are standing on a catwalk and shoot down at them they will seek cover out of view, taking you by surprise when you are forced to go down and deal with them. The dev's even said they would rather have one intelligent AI than several dumb ones which should give you an even better idea of how good they are.So ISM is simply the most dynamic, believeable and suspenseful experiences you will hopefully ever feel in a FPS all while being a beautiful game with an almost perfect community and development team!Thumbs up with a well desevered recommendation and big thank you to Zero Point software for such a brilliant game.

								It's incredible on how this game is so realistic, yet still in it's developing stages. There are multiple maps with envorinment settings. So you can go to one server with a map and it's raining, and as you play in the map the weather actually changes to where it'll be easier to fight, or to where it'll be harder to fight.-Weaponry/Equipment: At this time, there is only 1 weapon, which is an assault rifle. Yet, you also have the abiloity to activate a lazer for you to help with your accurasy, a flashlight incase it get's dark (game sometimes has you in pitch black darkness), of course you can zoom in by right-clicking, and unlike any sci-fi FPS, you can actually take off your visor. So it'll be like fighting with literally your own eyes. But the game doesn't give you a cursor to aim with like Halo, Battlefield, TF2, etc. You actually have to aim like everyone does in real life when in combat.-Maps: There are multiple maps that go from the middle of a swamp, to the cold regions, to a colony in the forest. All maps has the ability to change the weather to throw off players.-Game Mode: So far, there is only one game mode where you hold a certain area for the longest, but as time goes on, the capture zone will move into a different area of the map. In order to win, you must hold the capture zone for the longest when the time runs out, or when the amount of time you hold it reaches it's max. Either way, you have to work with your team in order to win. Cooperation and skill will bring you to victory in this game.Overall, this game is incredible for it to be an Early Access Game, I recommend this game to anyone that reads this.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has some amazing potential. Despite the (current) lack of content, the dev team has already nailed the atmosphere of Dead Space cross Rainbow Six , with some surprisingly immersive gameplay and gorgeous graphics from the Unity Engine. Your player character is very human-slow, vulnerable, and brave. Teamwork is just as important as twitch reflexes and awareness of your enviroment, and while the game can be played alone it is difficult and boring without at least someone else by your side. The game currently fearures a decent Multiplayer experience, several solo challenge missions, and two epic story missions pitting you and a team of 3 others up against intelligent and dangerous training robots simulating events from the IM backstory. While many features such as more guns (currently only 2), missions, and enemies (Land Sharks), the game feels balanced and very well done. According to the devs, this has been tehir life's dream for almost 20 years now, and they are very unlikely to give up and leave this as vaporware. The one complaint I have is the development cycle: with only 12 people building the equivalent of a AAA-quality title, it takes several months to update the content. If you're willing to wait, gab the game and start playing-realistic difficulty is hard and takes a lot of cooperation and skill to complete, so don't excpet to be bored. And if it feels too risky, keep an eye on Interstella Marines-this game is going places.			"

Early Access Review
								In its current state it is a very good game. The only thing that bothers me is its unoptimized state in which it is, but since it is in early access I'll let it slide for now. Singleplayer:Before I installed the game I read reviews about it and saw that people got scared while playing singleplayer.At first I was confused as to how a shooter with robots can be scary. Then I played the singleplayer and I understood.It's pretty scary when a robot starts to run towards you. Although they may seem non-frightening, their faceless head can spook you once it randomly pops up in front of you.Co-op:Didn't play so I can't comment on that, sorry.Multiplayer:The multiplayer for Interstellar Marines was quite fun for me actually, although in my past I played only CoD multiplayer(long time ago). To be honest it took me a little to get used to the guns(only 2 for now) and the lack of crosshair(instead you use a laser), but because of this I was forced to focus on my little tiny dot and I was sucked into the game. The game for now has a small amount of maps, but the ones that are in it currently are very well designed and I look forward to future maps. The players that I played with didn't chat alot so but the ones that did were very nice. I would recommend this game to the people who love strategic shoters as it involves alot of tactical cooperation between players, if you want to win ofcourse.Although I played the game while it was free for a couple of days, I will buy it as soon as I get money as it is worth the money and the wait for better optimization.

								Although I couldnt play the campaign mission because somehow it crashes (I dont know if it is my problem or the tutorial is the only mode playable to date) anyways, I think I can say something about it. The concept of the game its actually pretty good, trying to figure out what was the character doing there though, it doesnt really tells anything about that, but I'll give them some time to think that. No crosshair, soft movements in the gun while moving the camera, makes it very realistic, and the atmosphere its awesome, the darkness and the fight against the training robots made me feel scared as f*ck, and I loved it. I would say its a game you should buy as quick as possible, but its an Early Access, so, we'll leave it to that, before you buy it you should wait until the game it's out. The graphics are great, not the best ones, but hey, you gotta admit that they are not bad. There are almost no graphic options, apart from the quality of the shadows and some view quality options (Depht of field, etc) , and that its disapointing. As far as I seen, this game has future, its pretty ""green"" yet, but you just have to wait!(Note to developers: Please put more graphic options on it, THEY ARE NECESARY! :D)			"

								So the first time I got into this game I did with my bro. And we started the first mission, now understand me and the bro play alot of games together. So there I was with bro in the hold of somekind of transport shuttle learning the basics crouch, flashlight, mic check... alright lets do this. Cover positions and open the door. Its dark, really dark, no sounds. *click. flashlights on all I see is a husk of some kind of training robot. Nothing, we proceed to alpha on our HUD. Nothing. It's quiet, that makes us very cautious; checking everything. What is our enemy that cleared out the all the people? We drop out of some kind of vent system. Nothing, ""Wait! I think I heard somthing."" squawks the mic... I stop and listen... I hear it too, some kind of groan or moan mechanical in nature. The noise is far off to our right. Slowly we move toward the noise cover to cover. As we get closer footsteps are heard and the sound of hydraulics powering the footsteps. And then I see it. The device appears to be the kind of robot I saw earlier, but fully functional. The source of the sound. It's not facing me it's not armed. I hestitate, IT SEES ME. The thing lets out a howl/moan hurting my ears as it runs into the darkness. I lost my cool and start spraying bullets after it. The sound of gunfire bouncing off the walls is replaced with ""click click click"" of my gun going dry. No auto reload... fear as start to try to get a new mag into my gun. At this point I remember my bro, he is fine, but he has to reload as well and is waiting on me to finnish. More clunking footsteps... our friend is coming back I see it over on the left. Too slow; a shot rang out into the darkness as the creature falls lifeless to the hard steel floor. My bros smug voice comes over the com, ""ya ya shut up, I would of got e'm."" And then footsteps, many many clunky footsteps...			"

Early Access Review
								Interstellar Marines by Zero Point Software, seems like a fairly nice game for the STEAM Early Access price starting at under $18.99.  It has a single-player mode, but more importantly a four-player coop mode is already present.  The shining uniqueness about the game is that it is 90% community funded and 95% community driven... it also it has space sharks?Over time the developers are releasing small pieces of the game that focus on specific systems - shooting, movement, settings, actual content, etc.  Zero Point is made up of two developers who are independant of the big publishing companies and mainstream support.  So updates and added content is a very, very, very slow process.  This could be a potential problem for some gamers and a deal-breaking-con for others.Zero Point have put out a video showcasing new footage of the game and bringing you up to speed on its development.  Right now you can sign up for a free account at the game's official website and play any of the pieces right in your web browser!==> http://www.interstellarmarines.com/The technology is pretty impressive, the game looks great, and there's even achievements and leaderboards to track your progress if you are into that sort of thing. Game Machanics:  The fluid first person view is kind of flexible.  You an run, walk fast, and jump a little.Weapons and Gear: There's only a rifle and SMG.  Both have reflex style sights with an optional laser dot.  You get a flashlight for those darkend areas of the game.[center][flash(425,350)]http://www.youtube.com/v/dhk-2Wb_IyQ[/flash][/center]			"

								OK first off the game presentaion is superb, the graffics are very well done, the story is solid, BUT!!!!! there are issues. Firstly the game is very graphics heavy and NOT recomended for Mac books i use one and it lags running a meer 19 frames when looking out along the enviroment: and its almost impossible to shoot normaly let alone with that. The AI is not bad, a little dumb sometimes and then all of a sudden they can see you in the dark. There are no draw distance (how far away you can allow objects to apear or render) settings, and no terrian graphics settings or model graphics settings, making this game almost a waste of time for people with low end systems who cannot adjust this to help thier game run better. I will recomend this game ONLY to those who use PC's. 5/10.			"

However, these reviews are not slights on this game. The reason I say this is becasue the level of presicion, how pollished it is before release, the absolute immursion of this game....this isnt achieved without taking your time with it. This is not just another FPS game, its verging on a work of art with how profesional it feels.I want to see that single player campaign too. I want to see the sharks too.

								This game is really interesting in the combination of fps and stealth, but there are some things that definitely need to be fixed:1) Framerate. Now I know this is probably just my computer, as I have the same problem with nosgoth, but when I tried to fix the resolution, suddenly all of the buttons registered my mouse only when it was several inches away from the actual button. THIS IS NOT GOOD, but it is a small problem that probably could be fixed with a quick update.2)Lighting. This game is pretty dark, with lights in the levels shutting off randomly, even without me shooting them, and I have no idea if this is on purpose, or a bug. some explanation would be helpful. Also, incorporation of a night vision feature would greatly help, as a flashlight automatically gives me away, and as was previously mentioned, this game is pretty freaking dark.3)Audio. The computer giving me directions in the game sometimes repeats things, and again this is a problem that I'm not sure is intended or not, and if not, this is just another small problem that could be fixed with a quick update, as instruction was sometimes garbled among itself.Overall, though this is a really cool game, with solid controls, decent graphics (for an early access game), and a really cool helmet/HUD feature that entertains me to no end. I would love to see this be a full release and move beyond the early access stage, as this game has a lot of potential.			"

Interstellar Marines, what can I say it is a very soild single-player/co-op FPS focusing on realism... well are real as you can get for a sci-fi game. Multiplayer is this game's strong point at this stage of development, and might I add it is very well done I mean this game has dedicated severs to make it even better. The 4 player co-op in this game is all of these 3 things fun, challenging, and scary all at the same time and it mixes together in a great way. So being very brief this is a great little game with good game mechanics and game design. The maps are well made, the audio is good, and the visuals are pleasant to look at. Also this game is actually updated and is not just an abandoned cause!			"

Early Access Review
								I've been following Interstellar Marines for close to 5 years now. I remember it caught my eye on ModDB. Fast foward to 2015 and the amount of content has barely shifted from that initial concept stage. Hell, I'd say the majority of the concepts first portrayed still aren't present in the game itself and it's hard to say if they ever will be. That, in of itself, is enough to push me to make a ""negative"" review.A sci-fi, story driven tactical FPS is what this game was supposed to be about. You'll be getting a semi-decent multiplayer arena FPS with two guns instead. Believe me, the groundwork is there, it's just not going anywhere fast. It's simply not worth the 20 dollars it asks for.I won't lie, this was in many ways a bitter disapointment to me as my hopes were high and the concepts/ideas lured me in for many, many years. It just seems like by the time we actually see the game progress in any meaningful manner we will all be experiencing mid-life crisis.  "

								Really fun game, the immersion with the HUD only being available while using a helmet is amazing, gunplay feels solid, and the Lighting effects are absolutely fantastic. Shooting out lights to get the upper-hand is a great mechanic.The only downside is that there's not much in it so far, there's 1 Solo mission, 4 co-op missions, and a few multiplayer maps/missions, other than that it's pretty awesome.

								Alright, quick review after a couple of matches.The concept, I love it, it focuses around team-work, covering eachother and completing objectives (far as I know there's only a domaination gamemode), not only that it focuses on tactics but your ability to score headshots as bodyshots are practically and as far as I've seen, is the only way to take another player out.With that said, the difficulty is increased futher the only gun your given (a SMG) is suprisingly unweildy with a ""tough but fair"" recoil, it seems to be designed around the players skill, like for instance:It was quite possible for me to perch myself at a vantage point and take headshots from somewhere between medium and long range, it can be, by no means be a makeshift sniper rifle but the reason it's possible for me to pull it off is only because the first shot is percise and the sight is clean and simple.One thing I also must point out is that the weapon your given has 2 accessory's, a flashlight and a laser sight:The flashlight is useful for dark area's and spotting enemy's as they don't have any indicator or name-tag appear but doing so might give away your position so sometimes it's better to keep it off and hide in the dark (choice is yours).Now one thing that took me a while to notice is that there is no crosshair, none (mostly because I don't play games with one where there's alturnatives) you've only got your ironsight for percise aiming but obviously iron sight's impractical if in closer quaters which is what the laser sight is for, it allows you to aim percisely from the him but this also comes with the drawback as enemies will also be able to see your laser beam and can track it right to your position, so both are quite useful but  thourght and caution is needed before using them.There are a few design choices that I like and dislike but both are by no means should be used for judgement on wether should be considered positives or negatives as they are my own personal prefrences:Positvies (+):+ Real emphisis around teamwork, skill and tactics+ As matches goes on, the level's change conditions (from light to dark, from clear to foggy, from thick updrafts to rain)+ Gun add-on's gives extra flavor to combat .Negatives (-)- Obviously the game is not finished so you will be stuck with the same gun and gamemode but there's some variation of maps that I found quite sufficiant and intresting as well, especially how the level's morph and make full use of the landscape.- Not as many players as I would of liked to see playing the game- When you get hit it disables your hud which also means your teammate's indicators resaulting in possibly you accidently killing your teammate.Overall, a very promising game and worthy of consideration.

								I've played many combat sims and even though this isn't big (I often play with names I recognise) the one thing I find is that I can join ANY game and the whole team are playing as a team, even if they've never played together before. That's something I've not seen in CoD and BF. It's also not difficult to get into, there's no gay level up system, only raw skill and teamwork separates players so it's well balanced, and you can pick up and play shortish games. Fine, I like the odd long campaign but it's not something I always have time to do.People are complaining about weapon selection and so on need to remember that in real life you don't get to choose those things. This game is going for realism, so it would be obvious to provide standard issue weapons. The addition of the supressor is in my opinion the difference between success and failure in coop games. Too much noise will bring the entire robot army to your position in seconds! Better hope you have good buddies...This game is definately coming along nicely. Coop and campaign add to the already enjoyable multiplayer mode, and all modes are best played with stealth and planning. It gets your brain thinking and your heart pumping.Those of you that know me well know I generally don't put a lot of effort into things unless I'm really passionate about, so the length of this review should be a good indication of my my I enjoy this game.

								Pretty fun game so far.  It kind of gets back to the basics of FPS without a lot of flashy and twitchy gameplay.  The environment changes during the match, keeping things interesting.  I also enjoy the use of ""night"" maps, where you are forced to use a flashlight.  Although this game is early access I can see it going far.			"

								I'm not sure if I can recommend this. The engine is really great and the maps are alright, but the current multiplayer element is (for me) not fun at all. The only gun shoots terribly, with scope sway all the time and huge recoil. Also, it takes a bunch of bodyshots to kill someone (like 5-7) but only one headshot, so if you aim for center mass then you lose every time. Of course, it's in alpha so I have it anyway and I can't wait for the finished game. I just won't play it much until then.			"

								Review for Interstellar Marines Update #10LINK TO VIDEO REVIEW: 


YouTube™ Video:

Zero Point Software has proven that nothing will stop them from finishing Interstellar Marines. With long list of development setbacks, managing to get Interstellar Marines to this point is a huge accomplishment. For the past month, Zero Point Software has been working extremely hard to release the latest update for their game, update #10. Is it any good? Well, it’s a step in the right direction.Visuals: At first glance, you will notice some major changes to the visuals. The HUD has been completely reworked, the weapon model has been replaced with a new, modern looking assault rifle, and the overall realism of the environments and their effects all blend together to make a very polished feel. I’ve been killed quite a few times while stopping to watch the environment change its weather cycle because it just looked that good. But, as much as I like the new visuals, the option to turn off the bloom effects has been removed, and while this makes the game fairer for those who would keep these effects on and play with the disrupted vision, the bloom glow effects can sometimes feel overused and disrupt the vision to the point of frustration. It would be nice to see ZPS turn down these effects or balance them more to keep the visual impact, but not make any sacrifices on the game-play side. Also, when you are walking, the HUD moves and bobs so much that it’s almost impossible to see who is on your team or what their score is without completing ceasing all movement. I liked to check how my friends are doing in previous updates but now I feel more excluded.Gameplay: There is no doubt that Zero Point has worked very hard on making the experience in Interstellar Marines as smooth and polished as possible, and it really shows here. With the addition of a crouching and basic cover system in update #10, the tactical element has never felt more important. I’ve never had so much fun hopping from cover to cover with my squad mates. And the excellent improvements to the sound design only add to the overall experience. In one instance, I would be moving from cover to cover with my squad mates to reach the building across, zzwhile being sniped by the enemy team from across the map. It’s moments like these which make Interstellar Marines different and memorable than any other shooter. The more ZPS improves the features in the game, the more the game will feel alive. Sometimes, though, the cover system doesn’t always work. The camera’s height adjustments when popping in and out of cover can feel a bit clunky and switching from crouching to standing to quickly escape gun fire feels too difficult to achieve and ends up in a cheap death. This isn’t a game breaker, but since the cover system is a big deal, after a few matches, the errors start to really stand out and impact my overall experience. With the lack of support for any communication with your squad mates personally in game, players are still forced to communicate through and outside source, which isn’t bad, but just a bit tedious. I understand that this is still an early update for the game, and the developers have promised some sort of squad communication system in the future, so I am looking forward to seeing what they will do with this.Summary: Update #10 is a welcome addition to Interstellar Marines. While it has a few flaws, it’s a step in the right direction. It doesn’t do anything to drastically change the core game-play, but the additional features being added each update is really making a huge difference in the game and the fan base. ZPS has done an amazing job with the game so far, and I can’t wait to see where they take this game. Visuals: 9.3 FANTASTIC VISUALS BUT THE OVERUSE OF BLOOM AND GLOW DISRUPTS GAMEPLAYGameplay: 7.5 CROUCH IS A SOLID IMPROVEMENT, BUT IT DOESN’T ALWAYS WORKAudio: 9 EXCELLENT SOUND DESIGN HELPS PULL YOU INTO THE GAMELasting Appeal: 7.4 VERY FUN, BUT AFTER A FEW MATCHES, THE PROBLEMS START TO SHOWFinal Score: 8.3 "

								Interstellar Marines is a game that reches for the stars. With a creative new way of making a fps simulation of future warfare in a multiplayer game. Even in its early stages it shows effects and gameplay elements that rival with half life and other great shooters that have come out over the years. Anamation may not be finished and ai still to be seen, but what it has so far is done with polish and has great stile. Its the game that just keeps getting better and i give it a 8/10 and expect it to get a 10/10 in the future.			"

								Interstellar Marines (Early Access) quick-review:Pros: - Great Lighting effects! - Extremely good use of sound. Sound is very important when playing the game. - Creative new game modes. (Like the last man standing/domination hybrid) - Very cool environments that dynamically change during matches which can very quickly change the way you play the game. - Very smooth gun-play. Aiming and shooting ""feels"" really good.Cons: - Early access (There's not a lot of content at this stage, you will find bugs, performance on each PC may vary) - Few servers (Likely to be fixed closer to launch) - Few players (Just not many people playing it at the moment which is fair enough). - A lot of features/content in the game description has not yet been added to the game.Verdict:If you are after a full featured game - hold of on buying until release (Or at least closer to release).However if you want to try out one of the most unique multiplayer FPS gaming experience you've tried in a while - grab the early access copy and give it a try!

								This game is really interesting in the combination of fps and stealth, but there are some things that definitely need to be fixed:1) Framerate. Now I know this is probably just my computer, as I have the same problem with nosgoth, but when I tried to fix the resolution, suddenly all of the buttons registered my mouse only when it was several inches away from the actual button. THIS IS NOT GOOD, but it is a small problem that probably could be fixed with a quick update.2)Lighting. This game is pretty dark, with lights in the levels shutting off randomly, even without me shooting them, and I have no idea if this is on purpose, or a bug. some explanation would be helpful. Also, incorporation of a night vision feature would greatly help, as a flashlight automatically gives me away, and as was previously mentioned, this game is pretty freaking dark.3)Audio. The computer giving me directions in the game sometimes repeats things, and again this is a problem that I'm not sure is intended or not, and if not, this is just another small problem that could be fixed with a quick update, as instruction was sometimes garbled among itself.Overall, though this is a really cool game, with solid controls, decent graphics (for an early access game), and a really cool helmet/HUD feature that entertains me to no end. I would love to see this be a full release and move beyond the early access stage, as this game has a lot of potential.			"

								Very fun. This game is exciting and terrifying at times. The stealth system is very fun to utilize and it is very tactical. Some things could definetly be added though. Instead of jumping walls or fences, you should have the ability to vault over things just to make movements smoother and fluent. More weapons could absolutely be added, including additional co op and campaign missions. It gets difficult to play them over and over again. It would be nice if a co op gamemode with rounds of difficulty was added, so you have to hold out. ALso, when you pull up your mask the other player should be able to see it. A greater variety of robots would be interesting as well. A list of objectives would help when you become completely lost in a mission too.			"

The maps are very well balanced and having changing environments during the match so it doesn't get boring or feel like the maps are repetative. The gameplay is very raw and has a great feel to it. There's no croishair etc unless u zoom in etc. etc. Best thing about this game is undoubtedly the lighting. The lighting effects brings something to an mutliplayer FPS that I just havn't seen.

								Game is Early-access , so i can't say fully what game looks like, it is only MP out now and still SP and COOP is next to come, But only Multi-player is good to Support developers, Personally i liked MP itself and waiting for every new update ! Idea of game is something new...it may lack content,but  Atmosphere is So Great,The way game changes his Condition in mid-game More then once is awasome.			"

								Interstellar Marines is a fantastic sci-fi 1st person shooter. The developers show that they care by using tons of detail. The enviornments change, from day to night to rain to snow in just a short match. The player has so many decisions to make when this fantastic enviornment changes, you can use a flashlight attachment to your gun, have a laser sight, open and close your helmet visor. For example, in the night you can choose to use your flashlight to find people or you can creep around in the shadows (in the dark.) Another nice feature is you can walk around the maps by yourself and get to them before challenging others. This game is early access so you can imagine there are a few turn-off's as of right now, lag, the campaign has not been added yet, and sadly as far as I know there is only 1 or 2 guns in multiplayer. Overall though I would recommend it, if you are intrested I would purchase this game asap before it becomes to expensive because I think this game has a great future. It is a blast in my opinion similar to Halo and Call of Duty mixed with an amazing fighting enviornment. I would ABSOLUTELY recomend this game to anyone who likes 1st person shooter games.			"

								Pros - I've gotta say that this game is awesome. Overall, the graphics are absolutely stunning, and the visual effects are extremely satisfying to look at.The gameplay itself is immensely realistic and enjoyable. The AI is good (and very scary too xD0Not only that, but the community is mature and very helpfulImmersive enviromentsPretty consistant updates :DConsOptimization - I get maximum 35 - 40 fps and it can very very occasionally drop down to 15 - 20A lot of servers are empty The Neurogen Incident is extremely laggy unfortunately since it is a gigantic map xDDoes need load-outs and more weapons :POverall score - 7.5/10 (but I reckon that when it is completed it will be atleast a 9.5/10 :P)Notes - I have a youtube channel - GamingHatchElite - it would be great if you could check it out!

								Good game so far from what I've played. I love the environment that differs from your normal FPS.Completing some missions solo makes it more enjoyable and intense.Yes some of the game seems clunky (jumping for example) but honestly it's not that bad. Feels a bit more immersive that you can't constantly run around sprinting like you can in most of the mainstream FPS' out currently.Would love to see more weapons, and yes I realize it is still early access but some variety is always a good thing. Same goes with enemies.Larger maps would be another bonus for me.Biggest downside of this game is the bugs. Yes I realize it is still early access, but not being able to complete a certain game type due to do a bug causing your mission item not to spawn gets annoying after a while.Would love to see a more completed version of the game, but still highly rated IMO.

								Well, I've bough the game... It's in Alpha...  I joined a little tiny almost-empty server... I had more fun than I ever had in any other game ._.Basiclly all I did was running around, playing with my Gun's flashlight and laser pointer, nonstop opening/closing my mask and failing at killing other people while talking in the chat to a (so far) nice community...It's just that the Atmosphere is so dynamic and interesting aswell as unique it's just fun to go around there, when it's dark - It's REAL darkness, when it's rainining - You acctually know there's rain, it changes your gameplay and tactics.So, Atmopshere : checked,  Community : Checked, Graphics : Checked, optimization : Checked, Gameplay : Yup.All we're missing is some explosives!

								This Game is in early alpha and its truly fantastic graphically and everything else. SUPPORT THIS GAME! there are Nine people working on it and they update frequently. This game needs as much support as possible. It is amazing what these few people are doing and I am super excited for the campaign and co-op campaign, and with more support, it can be finished faster. Whats more is that for right now, 15$ for the game forever is an amazing deal that is unregrettable. Anyone who is a Sci-Fi FPS (like halo and any other semi spacy short future stuff) fan would love this game. BUY IT. You read other comments saying bad things. But the more support this game gets the better it will become.			"

								Interstellar Marines is a very good first person shooter game. I am tempted to say it is one of the best I have played, but I have played many FPS games and so it would be  kinda hard to say it was one of the best. For an early access game though, it is amazing. The developers really seem to pay attention to every little detail to make the game immersive, tactical, and most of all playable. I say ""playable"" because some early access games may have alot of bugs/glitches, but Zero Point has done a great job of getting down to business and making the game very fun. I am looking forward to the future updates, and eventually the final release. this game is definately worth getting!			"

								I think this is a good game.Multiplayer:+ nice maps+ not many bugs+ not boring+ i like that you can see enemies when its dark    and they have flashlight on- long respawn time- sometimes there are teamkills because    the hud is going away when you are hurtI cant say more just yet because i didnt play the campaign but ithink with more maps,weapons and other stuff its going to be a very good game.      9/10 Would get scared by enemies popping out of nowhere in the dark again.

								Quite a different shooter, which I do enjoy very much. There isn't much to it at the moment, as it is Early Access, but the game definitely has a future. The HUD is minimal (and can even be switched off by pressing H to lift up your helmet), which I like. The gun (only one so are) is easy to use, and feels nice - makes for good balancing, too. What's more, the game looks pretty nice, especially at night.Whist I don't know if I would pick this up now, It's worth putting this game on your wishlist, as this has potential.			"

 Awesome game The devs managed to combine the feel of a tactical FPS and the atmosphere of a Sci-Fi horror game. Multiplayer and co-op is frustrating yet fun. Has a campaign mission but only has 2 weapons currently. The Problem The ping is unstable and i managed to find a server glitch where the match is only 4 seconds long and then 'no winner is found', and it keeps repeatating. Respawn time is too long and it made lots of people rage quit (should be 60-70 sec instead of 100+). Conclusion Interstellar marines a good tactical FPS game in its own rights, it's spooky and challenging. I highly recommend this game for FPS/Sci-Fi horror fans and for those who seeks challenge and frustration.			"

								I've been following this game, for a few years; basically I seen mutant land sharks, and well I am still left waiting for it. Lets be honest this game is early access but its good, the basics are there, and the shooting omg, I havent played a game that I feel like Im actually hitting where I aim. Perhaps many will say its unrealistic as there doest seem to have any variation of flight, but damn it feels good to know you as the player are on point.  Where is the game now? Well, its playable with a some bugs that are easily repeatable but nothing that breaks the game. There are 7 maps, and really it doesnt seem like much. And once you clear them all with you group of friends its hard to go back to them. And you will need friends, this game can be hard and failing is a part of it, but with a full group of friends there are alot of tactics to try in all the maps  in all the modes. It just feels like there isnt enough game yet, esp with updates so far between eachother. The online server chooser needs to be fleshed out a bit, currently a slight pain to get a game going, but not hard either, just missing some nicities. So for me and my group, there isnt enough yet for us to buy into I.M.'s Early Access yet. BUT if an update adds the sharks and give me some LAN play, I'm all in. It just need a bit more.			"

During a multiplayer match the map changes its states : Sometimes you fight in the dark, using your lamp torch with moderation to not be spotted by the enemies, and some times you fight during a winter storm. It's awesome! OVER 9000!			"
