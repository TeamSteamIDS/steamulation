												I took a crap once that came to life. That animated turd found a mate and they together were married and had several turd babies. One of those turd babies married a used diaper. Together they had one child. That child grew up and became a game developer and created a game called Snow Cat Simulator to sell on Steam. This is not Farm Simulator with snow. It is a thrown together turd/used diaper which sucks.  "

YouTube™ Video: Steam Cleaning - Snowcat Simulator

			Despite it's name, this game is not about playing domesticated snow leopards. It is infact a vehicle simulation game where players are tasked to do basic labor jobs framed around a ski resort.		

Despite it's name, this game is not about playing domesticated snow leopards.  It is infact a vehicle simulation game where players are tasked to do basic labor jobs framed around a ski resort.As a simulator the game immediately fails by not providing an accurate physics system.  Vehicles are light and bouncy the snow has no mass or volume.  All this cause the experience to feel fake and painted on instead of an actual simulation.Additionally the generic vehicles lack any identification that combined with missing UI elements results in a lot of guesswork for players to figure out what vehicles are and how to use them.

												This game... my friends: one hour of gameplay feels like 12 hours. If you wanna have ""fun"" for a very long time, go and get it! A nice feature to extend the gameplay: save the game and you'll lose all your fuel. Very funny when you're at the end of the map and have to drive with amazing !!10Km/h!! back to the base!!! The controls are AMAZING and the mechanics are so creative!!! BUY IT!!!			"

												First of all, idea is good. Make a game about snowcat's, those vehicles which are very important on skiing centers. But, here's come but: The way how this game is done is horrible. We have graphics from 2005, i mean, c'moon this game is published in 2014, i expect little bit better graphics. Controls were average but i experienced some input lag, controls lagged little bit when minicat were on carage. +Props for multible vehicles!			"

												Great game if you want an extremely buggy incomplete game that you can play with your friends and trash talk about it until it crashes your computer and you request a refund.			"

												The snowcat driver has really dead eyes. Wait... he isn't moving either. A tragic story of death and haunted snowcats. Mabey the other Snowcat Simulator will be better. >>  "
