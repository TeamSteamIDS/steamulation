												Edit: As of writing this review, I have 20 hours logged in Stellaris.  Stellaris has been out for 29 hours.This is the story of those 20 hours.My friends and I all arranged to play stellaris together on release.  I didn't know what to play until I remembered that happiness is a core game mechanic - unhappy people rebel, happy people don't.  I don't want rebellions, those make people even more unhappy.  If I took ""Spiritualist,"" I'd get a nice 5% bonus to happiness.  Even better, if I grabbed ""Fanatic Spiritualist"" I'd get a whopping 10% bonus to happiness and wouldn't have to worry about rebellions ever.It wasn't deep enough.I found the communal trait, which adds +5% happiness, and the charismatic trait, which gives everyone on a planet a +1% happiness bonus for every member of my race on that same planet.I had to go deeperI found out that by balancing my racial attributes, national ethics, and even my form of government, I was able to get a total +25% boost to my happiness.  I ended up as a fanatically spiritual, pacifistic race of charming people who just like getting along with everyone.  To top it off, I found the most fitting racial portrait - a classic grey alien, the kind you see in all of those old movies and tv clips about ""Alien abductions.""  Classic grays, but with a big, doofy grin slapped permanently across their faces.My friends all started on the opposite side of the galaxy from me, so I was stuck surrounded in a sea of AI.  It didn't matter what I did, my people remained happy.  I manipulated my neighbors and pitted them against each other for my own gain.  I created a superalliance with my angry fungus neighbors and invaded the birds who were restricting my movement, distributing them across my empire while stripping away their power and influence even on their homeworld.  I shipped them across my empire, balancing them with my own grinning populace across the empire - we live on the same kind of world, after all.  And we were all so, so happy.But we needed more friends.So I found some primitives, who hadn't achieved spaceflight yet.  I set up a research post and began lightly observing them.  Then, of course, I began the process of bringing them up to speed with the rest of the galactic community.I then genetically modified the boars to be just as happy as we are.  This is where this game is, now:  My friends are politicking on the other side of the galaxy, making and breaking alliances in power struggles that send ripples far enough that I've seen their effects over in my corner of the galaxy, where I've spent my time well:  genetically modifying the subjugated aliens of my empire to be happy, just like us.Thanks to this game, I have been awake for 40 hours and it's finals week.And I have no regrets.Update from 5/11:I managed to explore around an unexplored chunk of the outer rim, finding several of my friends.  Meanwhile, I enlightened 2 more species and was working on a 3rd when we saved and quit.  They were fully integrated into my empire very quickly but we only bothered to modify one of them, as the other was naturally happy.My alliance with the angry fungus was expanded with the addition of my super-xenophile cat-neighbors.  Fully 1/3 of the galaxy's cat-people population quickly migrated to my planets and set out being so productive and so happy as a result of being surrounded by my people that engineering them would actually be a waste of resources.The Alien loving cats, the angry fungus, and I all immediately set about molding our corner of the galaxy's nations to mirror our own by invading them and ""liberating"" all of their planets under new governments we set up to be more sympathetic to our ethics.The entire time my friends were wailing, moaning, and there was much gnashing of teeth as they were slowly ground down by a non-player Empire that was consistently thrashing their armies until, after 15 years of war, they managed to research better shield systems to counter their powerful lasers and turn the tide of the war and secure them a white peace.My friend Joe wasn't so lucky and couldn't secure an alliance with the rest of my friends on their side of the galaxy before the same non-player empire declared war on Joe, took one planet, liberated another under its own new government, and vassalized him.That's when we saved and quit until next time:In summary:I'm slowly increasing in power and enlightening more races into blissful happiness as my friends are at constantly at war and Joe is getting vassalized by non-player empires.

												185+ Hours and 3 full campaigns in and I finally feels like I can review Stellaris objectively.Stellaris is a 4x grand strategy game from Paradox. So I kind of expected a Civilization in space kind of game (Like Galactic Civilization 3) which isn't a bad thing since I love 4x games. But what I got was something different; a 4x, grand strategy, customizable, nearly open-ended RPG. And that is where this game sets itself apart from all others in the 4x field.Campaign 1 – Since everything was new I tried to chose things familiar; Humans, warp drive, materialist, individualist, etc... While I found myself at odds with the influence and sector mechanics I was able to build a nice little empire with several allies in a federation. Eventually building myself up to a real economic and military power. With the help of my federation friends we were able to stop aggressive neighbors, over-throw a fallen empire and beat back interdimensional invaders. More than once I found myself wishing for more victory conditions, and when I started feeling like it was getting a little stale I pumped out a crap-ton of colony ships to meet the domination victory condition (owning 40% of habitable planets). All in all a good run.Campaign 2 – Within 5 years I had encountered a Fallen Empire and they hated me from the beginning, instantly declaring war, which I immediately had to surrender. A couple of years later I met ANOTHER Fallen Empire and THEY hated me. I was playing peaceful, scientist, cat people... Maybe everyone was allergic because everyone, even regular empires, kept insulting me, threatening me, and declaring war on me until I was finally curb-stomped into a chunky red paste. What did I learn from my violent and abusive loss? Better influence and sector management techniques. Campaign 3 – Military Dictatorship using wormhole generators to move. What a difference a little experience makes! Never once during this campaign did I find myself struggling with the influence mechanic and working with the oddities of the sector mechanic have become rather easy. Fallen empires treat me as a child in need of patience, enemies avoided my vast fleets and my economic power was unmatched. When one of my rivals triggered a galactic wide robot uprising, all I needed to do was put all my robot populations to death and outlaw AI. Easy peasy! Later when I stumbled across the robot capital world I invaded with a genetically engineered xeno army, killed all the robots, and had  a beautiful Gaia world all to myself. Of course I had no friends, allies, trading partners, or anything else. Sadly, I started getting a little bored so I again jumped to a domination victory.Currently Stellaris is the tale of three games:Early game – Brilliantly fun and engaging! Lots of events that change depending on your pre-game choices, lots of 4x fun, and lots of role playing make the early game really enjoyable and re-playable.Mid game – Lots of repetitive management is required with not a lot of new game content occurring. Being a warmonger can certainly spice this part up but that may not be everyone's cup of tea.  Late game – Some very interesting galaxy wide events/disasters occur and the rise and fall of some of your neighbors keeps some interest. However, the lack of more victory conditions does make things drag a bit.Overall I love, LOVE, this game. Does it need more victory conditions? Yes. Does it need more mid game events? Yes. Does it need better tool tips? Yes. Are wormhole generators the greatest thing ever? Yes!One final thing to keep in mind is that the Clarke patch is about to release which will fix a lot of the sector issues and questionable AI decisions. And the future Asimov patch will address the mid game issues. Which means that things are going to keep getting better so I highly recommend this game to everyone.Edited to Add:Wow! The Clarke patch hit and what a change!Midway through my fourth campaign and suddenly, after load, the sectors started actually producing, science costs reduced slightly, fighter and bomber groups became wildly effective, federation partners began fighting their own battles (a bit), other empires asked for (and offered) safe passage through their space, diplomatic requests began to pour in, enemy AI combat decisions became much smarter, and all the frontier outposts I had been hiding in sectors to avoid influence costs grabbed me by the scruff of the neck, bent me over a log, and yelled “squeal like a pig!”What a massive improvement!The future Asimov patch is still needed for mid game content, but if you were waiting to buy Stellaris, well wait no more. It is even better now.			"

This is how my multiplayer went with some friendsI started as a Militarist/Materialist/Collectivist Squid people of the Valroran Science Directorate.My two allies were the UN (Filthy humans) and the Akkadian people (Some Fungaloids).We started at the top left corner of the galaxy, we're an organized group so this was going to be a federation victory anyway. To our immediate south was a fallen empire, Fanatic Xenophobes... great. Between our 3 allied factions were a faction of horrible Insectoid people called the Vir, they were an upstart empire that had huge chunks of territory, they were an IMMEDIATE THREAT, they were Fanatic Xenophobes, Militarist, and on top of all that, they were also strong and rapid breeders. The Humans started off as the weakest of the 3 allied empires, with the Valrorans and Akkadians as the two dominant powers.Our first task was to cause chaos to our neighboring empires, invade them and liberate the new worlds under our names so they adopt our ethos and love us, it was a huge success thanks to the Akkadian Empire's massive ground armies. The entire top left of the galaxy was soon a cookie crumb of small civilizations that hated each other except for their saviors. Our next task was to destabilize the Vir roaches. It was a lengthy campaign which costed tens of thousands of lives, it took almost 60 years to break up the Vir roach empire into little vassals, even after their downfall the Vir roaches were almost impossible to deal with, being fanatic xenophobes the Vir people were almost impossible to intergrate properly into the Valroran empire without rebellious factions popping up.My empire had conquered and enslaved several primitive planets at first (Middle ages, space age civs) and adding stellar empire races into my list of slaves was starting to feel like a burden, so I immediately opted to first regulate slavery for better working conditions, then ban slavery all together. BAD IDEA. Not only were these ungrateful lesser races not happy with being emancipated, they also started forming more rebel factions faster than ever. After 10 years since I passed the law to ban slavery, I immediately reinstated it (Xenos only of course). The next 20-30 years my allies were helping me fight off rebel wars happening in my territory.Suddenly, the fallen empire to our south awakens, we almost break our economies just to field a fleet large enough to fight the greatest threat in the galaxy so far. The Valroran fleet warps in first taking the brunt of the hit, then the Akkadians and finally the Human fleet. The battle was tense, the Valroran fleet was wiped out in the first battle against the 50k fleet power Fallen Empire. We thought we had won, we suffered extremely heavy casualties, suddenly the Fallen Empire's second fleet warps in, 60k fleet power. During the battle, the Akkadian fleet suffered extremely heavy losses, losing the entire fleet in the process, but somehow the Human fleet pulled off the impossible and destroyed the remaining Fallen empire fleet with less than half its fleet power. Now the Human Empire became the strongest force in the galaxy, with the strongest lead in technology and economy, as well as fielding the most powerful ships. The Valroran owned the most planets, the Humans had the strongest tech and economy, the Akkadians had the largest and most professional ground army in the galaxy.Skipping ahead, the Fallen empire to the south was completely eradicated with technology we stole from them and a much larger overall fleet size. Not even the scourge threat were a match for our combined fleets.During peacetime, my Human ally asks me if I could purge a planet for them from the annexed fallen empire systems. (The Human empire had a strict no slavery no purging policy). They send me control over the planet temporarily, I start purging the inhabitants of the planet and pass control back to the Humans. The Valroran Empire now deals in slavery and purging services for a nominal fee, the biggest customer is the Human Democratic Utopia.Our game isn't done yet, but TL;DR: My empire has now devolved into an empire that deals in black market services such as installing slave processing plants, purging races and exporting slaves.

												After sinking in almost 500 hours into the game across multiple playthroughs, I have finally decided to post my honest review of Stellaris in time for the tail end of the Winter Sale, to give some insight into any potential buyers if they want to spend the cash. In a brief sentence (for those who aren't keen on sifting through the rest of this review), Stellaris is a game you would like to pick up if you're a fan of 4X games AND have some patience for the game to develop. As it sits now, the game lacks a few key features that would greatly benefit basic functionality and also fixing and improving other parts of the game.Stellaris plays a lot less than traditional Paradox games like Crusader Kings, Hearts of Iron, and Europe Universalis. In the aforementioned games, the player takes control of a pre-determined country and plays in a historical fashion and progression of events. Stellaris, on the other hand, is a randomly-generated galaxy with random placements of not only the player's empire (anywhere from near the galactic core to the fringes of the galaxy), but of the AI-controlled empires. In addition, the placement can be manipulated through a few in-game options, like clustering empires together or randomly dispersing them, and also determining how many ""advanced start"" AI-controlled empires will be present in the game, including ""Fallen Empires"", which act as a major galactic obstacle and a potential mid-late game target to take down.The random nature of the game sometimes goes too far, in my opinion. Research is based on a pseudo-random card selection, where some researches are weighted to be produced during the card shuffle more than others. The chance is also weighted depending on what research leaders you have assigned to the respective laboratory: for example, a New Worlds researcher has a higher chance of drawing a New Worlds research every shuffle. While generally fair in it's card dealings, the random nature of research can lead to long periods of irrelevant researches. For example, my very first game, I never got the research card to increase ship energy production, leading to my military being severely stunted throughout the game.On military, there are two components of military combat: naval and army. Army is, for the most part, straightforward: produce either an immobile defence army on a planet or an offensive army capable of boarding landing craft and invading hostile worlds. Naval combat is a lot more diverse, and features a ""ship designer"", wherein the player and AI can handcraft their flavor of ships to their needs, including using kinetic ballistic weapons, laser weapons, plasma weapons, long-range missiles, torpedoes, point-defence guns, attack aircraft, and spinal-mounted mega weapons, which all have strengths and weaknesses relative to each other. It also allows equipping shields, armor, and auxilary components like afterburners.Since the empire you play as is not based in history, it also allows you to completely edit or create a new brand of empire, including how cities look, ships look, and even how your people look, with the ability to customize the phenotype of your people (ranging from humans to space foxes to space elves, and even fungoid creatures that have infected other spaceborne empires),  how your people behave from an ethical standpoint, which influences how the game can be played, who can be allied with, and what researches can be acquired (the 6 dichotomies being Individualistic, Collectivist, Materialist, Spiritualist, Xenophilic, and Xenophobic, each with their own playstyle), and how your species evolved (which includes a whole slew of evolutionary traits; the default Human start paints human evolutionary traits as Nomadic and Quick Learners, with a Continental habitat preference).This wraps up the main points of Stellaris without going in too far. While I have enjoyed my time in Stellaris, it definitely is not for everyone, especially with such a healthy selling price. If you are on the fence after reading this basic review, definitely try looking up gameplay or other reviews.			"

												I went back and forth on whether to give Stellaris a thumbs up or down. I really like Paradox Games: I've played a lot of Crusader Kings 2, which I think is incredible, and I pre-ordered Stellaris wanting it to be really good. Knowing Paradox's history with CK2 and extensive DLC support, I think Stellaris in a couple year's time is going to be amazing. At present, with fanboy goggles off, I think IGN's review has it spot-on. The game has a lot of great ideas mixed up with weak execution. Considering the amount of hype and sales it's already got, I doubt my single bad review is going to tank this game, so I'm putting this here for the devs to hear some of the things that can be worked on. My experience: The AI was so passive and my empire was so stable in the mid-game, I literally just sat and built battleships for lack of anything to do, and then when the [redacted] came, my 160k death-stack pew-pewed them into oblivion. I then sat and let the game run, and I now have almost every single tech. I'm not sure what's left to do.  I've stopped my playthrough because...I don't really want to go through the chore of conquering every other empire and there isn't really anything else to do.The biggest problems in my mind are two-fold and related: a lack of mid-game goals, and a lack of meaningful ways to interact with the world at large. Crusader Kings 2 was fantastic because it tied all its game mechanics together with people with deep traits and interactions you could interact with in multiple ways. It also kept empires from becoming stale because any CK2 player will tell you the biggest challenge with empires isn't conquering people, it's keeping everything together when your leader dies and every single up-start vassal wants to rebel. Stellaris doesn't really have this: leaders lack personality and pops don't have the same impact on gameplay. In all my time as a slaving Penguin Empire, I never saw a rebellion or significant unrest. This makes the mid and late game very static: you don't have reactive goals like 'Murder the upstart Duke of Lombardy' in CK2, and it's made worse by a simple, standard 4x diplomacy and war system, so you rarely feel compelled to interact with the empires around you. Additionally, Stellaris currently lacks tools to meaningfully solve problems. In CK2, dealing with eg, a useless heir was fun. Do I make him take religious orders? Marry him off to a foreign empire? Straight up murder him? Get him killed in a war? Stellaris comes close with some of the tools to interact with your alien pops, like slavery, gene modification, resettlement and edicts, but the way the game is set up right now alien populations aren't really a challenge: they don't rebel, or make significant demands for independence, or try to change your policies. So...you end up gene-modding them when you're bored, or when you lack things to do. Worse, and this is a big misstep, to deal with actual dissent the game just makes you pay some resources to make a 'Dissatisfaction' bar go down. Considering how well CK2 implemented rebellious vassals, this isn't really a good design decision. PROs:- Great empire designer- Engaging early-game, with exploration and anomalies- Lots of room to be expanded on- Genetically modify rebellious citizens - Meddle with primitive races- End-game crisesCONs:- War is really, really tedious- Lack of interesting ways to interact with other empires- No real threat of rebellion from leaders/alien pops- Framerate drops at mid-game makes the game more of a slog- Creating sectors isn't as fun as having vassals in CK2EDIT: Welp, the Paradox devs have talked about how their mid-game content was cut last minute before release and they'll be adding it back at the end of June, plus bug fixes and changes to Sector AI so check back then with Stellaris if you're on the fencehttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/05/16/stellaris-patch-1-1-content-plans/ "

Product received for free
												For those new to Grand Strategy games and/or cautious of Europa Universalis:Stellaris offers a nice entry to the genre if you haven't played one before. If you'd like, comparing to Civilisation, it is similar in concept in that you are managing your ever growing empire, maintaining relations with other empires, gathering resources and waging wars, but the system is somewhat more deep and complex in a number of ways. You must manage ‘leaders’ which includes balancing your investment in Science, Military and Government for example. There are various caps which mean that you cannot do everything at once and so must think about short term as well as long term goals in that regard. For those used to managing ‘population’ in Civ-like games this will not be too much of a step up.There are other aspects to the game as well such as exploration, missions, research projects and events – should you use the in game tutorial this can help guide you through some of these as and when they appear. The next thing to talk about is the level of customisation this game offers. To a new comer to the genre this will be very intimidating. I loaded up my first game having seen the huge numbers of different traits, policies etc for a given race only to find further customisation such as individual spaceship specifications and leader characteristics – it’ll be quite a challenge to try to learn these all at once so don’t try and just take it as it comes. I cannot say how it compares to games like EU4 and Crusader Kings in terms of level of customisation however as I have not played those games. The gameplay itself is reasonably placed, there was never really a time during my time playing that I have felt like I have nothing to do. The only down time I did have was when I myself couldn’t pick a strategy I wanted to pursue – to try and explore more for potential research events, to try and get trade deals with my neighbours, to clear out nearby star systems of hostile space creatures, to colonise more systems or even to wage war to capture a system in order to preserve my borders and corridor of travel between outposts.... the list goes on. Overall I felt that as a new comer I haven’t been as overwhelmed as I thought I would be. Having said that, while the tutorial pop-ups are helpful, they are few and far between after you get the very superficial basics down and the in game help is ‘currently’ non-existent in any meaningful capacity. Instead of having a comprehensive Civolopedia or sorts the help button takes you to a Wiki which at present is bare bones and not helpful in the slightest. I spent ages trying to figure out ways to increase my influence and having narrowed it down to a building upgrade I couldn't then find anything about how I can get to a stage where that building is available to me. No doubt this Wiki will be fleshed out over time however. Final points – the sound track is stellar *wink* and the gameplay is relaxing, reasonably paced and relaxing with the ability to ‘pause’ time while you manage your empire as it grows so that you do not miss anything important. During my time streaming in advance of release it certainly seems as though the community that this game will have will likely be helpful and welcoming as I had many enter my stream and point me in the right direction and clarify any questions I had regarding aspects of the game. Lastly the game certainly has that “Just a little longer.....” vibe and I found myself wanting to keep playing after midnight, and there is a certain satisfaction upon seeing your borders expand and your navy winning glorious victories. Stellaris gets a firm recommendation from me to players unfamiliar with the Grand Strategy and 4eX genres.I was given the copy for free but was not given any further incentive to be positive or negative. Keep in mind potential biases however. Feel free to ask me anything if you have any issues or concerns about what I have said with regards to this review. "

												Things to consider:- Are you ready to dedicate hours to learning about the mechanics? This is almost a con, but some may enjoy it (I do).- You WILL get screwed by RNG. Events will randomly happen, MTTH (mean time to happen). I got so strong that I woke up a fallen empire, then had some extradimensional aliens spawn in my backyard. Additionally, no tech trees. Your tech possibilities are randomly populated after each research.- Quite buggy for a year old game. Graphical glitches were normal, sometimes menus wouldn't open. With that said, I can't remember one thing that ruined my game.Within 100 hours of buying this game, I have 64 hours in game and worked 16 of those. Super addictive, micromanager's dream.			"

As you expand through use of colonies and strategically placed flags (also called frontier outposts by the humorless), you will work towards your goals for (insert goals here). This expansion will not go unnoticed, and you’re sure to make enemies and friends among the other races you’ve encountered, whose visual appearance has almost no bearing on their preferred world. (Personally my closest ally is a bunch of Sea-warthogs, and I’m also trading partners with a race of desert penguins)Combat is interesting. The number below your fleet tells you an idea of it’s strength, but not the whole story. You’d be tempted to think like CK2 or EU, where if you have the larger force and a good general you’re generally come out on top. But that’s not the case here. Just ask the 1st fleet of the United Nations of Earth. Armed to the teeth with anti-matter missiles, and assisted by several dozen ships of our fungi allies, up against a force less than 70% of their size.You actually can’t ask them. They’re all pretty dead. Point defenses turned out to be pretty good at point defense. So remember to not put all your eggs in one basket. Or Spores in one pouch, as the fungi say. Some missiles, some laser, spread the wealth.Diplomacy is fairly straight forward. You get along better with races that have similar morals to your own, and especially xenophiles in general, but through enough effort you can even getting along with xenophobes. (Those desert penguins mentioned above are kind of racists, but we get along alright). Embassies are a big help. Alliances can be pretty easily formed with those you get along with, and are a great way to both protect yourself and to make offensive wars easier. When declaring war as part of an alliance everyone has to approve it. This is made easier by distributing the war goals amongst the members. Basically a planet to the sea hogs, a liberation to the fungi, etc. Thankfully defensive wars are automatic. You can’t leave them hanging.The science and tech tree is a bit different from most because it’s not really a tree. It’s a set of cards you draw that you ‘draw’ three from and then decide which to work on. But my favorite part is definitely the science ships. You’re essentially playing as the Enterprise, boldly going where no one has gone before(star trek theme plays here). You’ll run into all sorts of anomalies that require investigation. Sometimes it’s a whole story line about precursors, sometimes it’s just an old cruiser stuck on a planet. Sometimes you run into a system full of million year old mining drones and have to book it. It keeps things interesting. The random events are very much what we’ve come to expect from paradox. A perfect mix of good writing and humor. Even the ol’ comet event comes around in it’s orbit.TLDR: It’s a really interesting take on 4x that is everything you should expect from Paradox, and sure to get better with time, and DLCs. A little difficult to learn at first but better than their other games.TLDR-2: Just play it.			"

												I just conquered a planet full of weird snail people who hate everyone after they revolted from my empire 20 years ago. I enslaved them all, installed a governor of my kind, and forbid them to reproduce. Then I landed a massive army on the planet to make sure they stay in line. Now I'll just work them till their dead and install my own species on the planet. This is the greatest game ever.			"

												This game features very extended diplomacy and economical aspects whilst building up your empire.Pros - Dynamic - No playthrough is the same (based upon Multiplayer experience though) - A lot of events so you will hardly encounter the same twice in a game (except for some starting events it seems) - AI is pretty good, though can sometimes be a bit passive. - Epic battles between fleets - Hot Joining in Multiplayer games - Being able to Host a savegame (I don't say do this everytime, but I like the option)Cons - You may be a little overwhelmed at first. There are a lot of options and it may take a short time to get to know them.			"

												To keep it simple-Pros:+ Brilliant early game, with twists, turns and several unique bits of writing and discovery. It becomes quickly apparent that a lot of love and dedication was put into this title.+ Pacing. Never feels too fast/slow, except for endgame, which I shall be getting to.+ GUI is simple, uncluttered and thematically amazing, rare in strategy games nowadays.+ Beautiful OST.+ Choice of traits and governments is pretty damn fun - especially when playing Space Hitler/Space Jesus.+ MOD SUPPORT 11/10.+ Just buy it, man.Cons:- While I have been fanboying over this title for a while and have absolutely fallen in love with it, there's no denying that the pace of your gameplay will slow down towards the late stages, which is expected. I trust mods and Paradox to fix this issue quickly though.- You will never know sleep ever again.Just to show you how addicting this is, I happened to purchase Dark Souls III at the exact same time as I preordered this - between watching Let's Plays and playing the game itself, I haven't even started my installation of DS3 yet. And I don't plan to either.			"

												WAIT FOR WINTER SALES.By then it will be patched more and be cheaper. Right now Stellaris has several fundamental problems (sectors, AI, diplomacy, to name a few) and it is still being patched regularly. The swinging balance changes makes me question whether even the developers know what they want this product to be.There is one other reason to wait, and that reason is mods. Mods are, hands down, the biggest reason to buy this game. There are several total conversion mods in the works. Including StarWars, Star Trek, Warhammer 40K, Mass Effect, StarGate, and others. Unfortunately none of them are finished yet, but they undoubtedly will be by December. Wait until Winter sales. You will enjoy the game a lot more then.I will update this review in December when Stellaris has been patched more.NOTE: I have 525 hours logged in CK2 and 246 hours logged in EU4.Also.... this review will probably get downvoted to hell by Paradox fanboys. Doesn't mean it's not a valid review.			"

												I could write a review for Stellaris and go into a great deal of depth about its gameplay and aesthetics, but I'm not going to. Instead, I'm going to tell you the story of Admiral Cax.The Tale of Admiral Cax, Hero of the Blessed Light of TorobaLong before he was born, Cax's people, an atomic-age civilisation of reptilians called the Netraxi, had noticed something odd about their leaders. Sure, they seemed fine from afar but on closer inspection they were just a little bit too...mushroom-y. Still, they shrugged and kept on doing whatever nuclear-powered reptiles do. And then the day came when the disguises fell and the Netraxi were taken over by the fanatically religious empire of slave-taking mushrooms that had quietly infiltrated their society using some questionable shapeshifting magic. The Netraxi were aghast. They were enraged. And then they were enslaved.These conniving chantarelles, known to their friends (not many) as the Blessed Light of Toroba and their enemies (quite a bit more) as the Doom Shrooms, were to be masters of the Netraxi for a hundred years. For this darkest of centuries, the Netraxi slaved away to supply their overlords with ambiguously-defined but evidently useful minerals, their labour rewarded only with contempt, and a reminder to worship the God-Emperor of Toroba at all times. The unhappiest Netraxi were sent down the mines. The happiest were released, allowed to be outraged about their situation for a bit, and then enslaved again just for fun. And when the Torobin went to war, the Netraxi were chained together and dropped as a welcome-mat for the Toroban armed forces to march over.Those hundred years passed, and the Torobin began to see the Netraxi in a more enlightened way. It was decided that some - though not all - should be emancipated to test their loyalty to their God-Emperor. Surprisingly, they were indeed loyal. Within ten years, the remaining Netraxi had been freed, but this was only the beginning of the struggle for freedom, All across Torobin space, a dozen other races remained enslaved, and the blatantly racist policies of the Torobin meant that there was only room for Shroom in positions of power.And then the great, glorious and eternally enlightened God-Emperor Zifin I (may his spores find warm soils!) decided that one - but only one - filthy xeno would be given the opportunity to lead Toroban forces. His case would decide whether or not aliens were worthy of being equals to those they had once called master. They chose a lowly Netraxi called Cax.Cax was a badass.Hired at the age of 41, he was immediately thrust into the Toroban war of conquest against an alliance led by the Bavi, a technologically superior race. Four fleets were deployed: three led by Torobin and the fourth led by Cax. Almost immediately the fleets were heavily engaged, taking severe casualties. Cax was sent to support a Toroban admiral, but when he warped in he found the Admiral's fleet destroyed, the gallant mushroom shredded and scattered across the system. Undaunted, Cax sent his fleet into the attack and smashed the Admiral's killers, securing the system. As the Torobin lost a second fleet to the Bavi, it was only Cax holding the line that gave the Torobin enough leverage to force a white peace and retreat with their dignity intact.This was only the beginning.Cax was sent back to Torobos to rebuild his fleet and upgrade it, in the expectation that the Torobin would soon be having a second go at the Bavi. Five years into the refit, however, he received the chilling news that a portal had opened up only a few systems away, spewing forth energy demons that wished only to feast upon the mortals' planets. The unlucky star-system was consumed. And then another system fell. And another. And another. And then it was Netraxis' turn. Cax could only look on via his monitor as his beloved homeworld, his people that looked to him for salvation, everyone, were all annihilated in a heartbeat. As the Torobin military crumbled he took his fleet to the furthest sector, the Malthin Bulwark, and gathered his forces for a desperate counterattack.And then the Fox nation attacked.Either through cold malice or a hilarious inability to perceive the danger of FRICKIN' WORLD-EATING ENERGY DEMONS, the race known only as the Sly Foxes decided to attack the Toroban Glorious Alliance with overwhelming force, right along the line of the Malthin Bulwark. Cax found his reinforcements cut off, his spaceports attacked and his empire still dined upon by the dreaded Unbidden. It was then, in this darkest of hours, that Cax made his move.With the Bulwark crumbling behind him, Cax launched a desperate attack against the Unbidden Portal with every warship the Torobin could muster. It was do or die. If he won, the Unbidden would no longer be able to spam doomstacks to conquer the ungrateful galaxy. But if he lost...the galaxy would be lost with him. At the age of 54, with a hundred warships in tow, this would be his finest hour.He did it.He frickin' did it.Surrounded by no fewer than three Unbidden doomstacks, Admiral Cax somehow fought his way to the portal and shattered the demons' grip on the galaxy, destroying two of the doomstacks as he did so. With his mission accomplished, he warped away to safety. Fewer than a third of his captains made it out. But the galaxy was saved. For any ordinary admiral, this would have been a time to celebrate. But Cax was no ordinary admiral.Cax was a badass.Badly damaged from the Battle for the Portal, Cax immediately returned his fleet to the Bulwark and smashed the Sly Foxes in a series of fleet-to-fleet battles, taking the war deep into the enemy's heartland. A little too deep, some might say, because there was the slight issue of his fleet being surrounded and utterly destroyed, but Cax made it out and his heroic counter-attack had once again turned a losing situation into a White Peace. By now Cax was pushing 70. Time to retire, the Torobin said.But badassery doesn't retire.Cax immediately took command of a new fleet being built to purge the galaxy of the Unbidden for once and for all. Armed with the latest weapons and cutting-edge technology taken from the Sly Foxes, Cax's Crusaders came together from all corners of Torobin space to follow their inspiring commander. The liberation was long and bittersweet, as although Cax was proud to be the Admiral chosen to drive the Unbidden from his homeworld, he knew that only the dead would greet him on Netraxis. But liberate he did, and at the age of 100 he destroyed the last Unbidden installation and restored the lost worlds to the Torobin. In gratitude, the God-Emperor transformed Toroba into a Mega-Corporation and emancipated every last slave, all thanks to Cax's heroism. And they all lived happily ever after, right?Wrong.Happily ever after is for people who haven't tried hard enough.Cax had a score to settle with the Bavi. They had destroyed his companions in the Bavi War. They had stood back and watched as the Unbidden destroyed his homeworld. Worst of all, they were just kinda there, y'know?. And so, at the age of 108, Cax set out for one final war. The names and legends of that war still echo down the ages. At Zabeem it was Cax who ambushed the 12th Bavi Fleet and smashed it to scrap. At Gandaros it was Cax who rescued the allied fleets from certain doom. At Kovin it was Cax who held the line as fleet after fleet warped in and were suddenly, but unsurprisingly, vanquished. And it was behind Admiral Cax that the entire allied fleet mustered for the final assault on Hydrobius that ended the war. Best of all, the surviving Netraxi were given permission to colonise the new worlds opened up by the Second Bavi War. Cax hadn't just saved his people, he'd given them a future too.When he died at 113, the mourning was brief and efficient. He would've liked it that way. RIP Cax.			"

												Time to tell you guys a story of the first full complete game, i had always started them but would just restart for random reasons but not this time.I was playing as a custom race of big hairy mammals ""The Advari Republic"" Crusaders of Democracy, they would bring democracy to all other species by force if need be(Always by force), "" Democracy was nonnegotiable"" was the motto of the Advari Republic. They would end up meeting another like-minded race(literally the same species portrait) and together with the strength of their new federation, the Populious Alliance, democracy was sure to reach every Species and nation in the galaxy....by ""Liberation"" if need be. The Federation had already Liberated 1/3rd of the known galaxy, their strength even surpassing that of the fallen it truly seemed nothing could stand in the way of liberty and democracy...until disaster struck, the research of Advanced Ai had seemed to be disastrous Robotic uprisings across the federation and the galaxy began to spring up. The federation fought long and hard, many famous Heroic Admirals who once liberated many species in the name of democracy would soon fall to the Robotic on slaught like pigs in a slaughter house. The federation put up a great fight but the Robotic uprising proved too much and the slow and painful purge of all life in the galaxy had begone. Once a Strong hold of Democracy, Beacon of Liberty, and the righteous defenders of the weak The Advari Republic was no more.Feels good finishing a game to the very end.			"

												- Create race of aquatic dwelling collectivist-militants. Military dictatorship, obviously.- Venture forth into space, everything is new and exciting.- Encounter space ameobas. Get wrecked.- Rebuild fleet, mark off that section of space ""off limits"" for now.- Continue making breakthroughs in laser weapon technology.- Encounter another spacefaring race. Seems freindly enough.- They put up an outpost near my empire.- Declare war.- Vassalize the pathetic alien infidels with my rebuilt fleet.- Kill space ameobas. Discover another intelligent race on a planet.- They are in the post industrial stage. Not quite able to harness the power of the atom.- built an orbital research station over their planet- study them- figure out some new things about biology- decide that the research would be quicker if we were a bit more aggressive- begin abducting them for research- few years later, realize that the planet would be a good source of slaves. and the best way to get them to willingly accept my rule would be to infiltrate their society- send agents down- everything was goes well- things are falling into place... until one of my operatives turned on me- one of my cells went dark. a team discovered the bodies. it was definitely one of my own that killed them- he contacts me a month later. explaining that he had fallen in love with the alien culture, and a woman- says we should dismantle the orbital station and leave this planet alone- disagree. but as long as he was willing to stay in exile, let him live. it's the least I could do for his service- sadly, he did not- he begins hunting my operatives. trying to expose us on the planet- this is unacceptable- pull remaining operatives. would rather kill all of these filthy aliens before allowing another of our kind die- bringl in a small fleet of warships and initiated orbital bombardment- brutally destroying the cities beneath them- there were no survivors10/10 would commit mass xenocide again.

												On my very first playthrough of Stellaris I came accross a peculiar little planetoid called Sol III, upon this planet there were ape like creatures that walked upright, talked a funny speech and had a strange fascination for my space vessels, of which they dedicated many generations creating structures to praise my people and fixate their obsessions upon, they called us Gods. Curious about them I had my people construct observatories around the craggy blue rock, sending me data of their advancements through the ages. I debated uplifting those who proved worthy, to bare the name of my glorious galactic empire to the universal stage. only months before my hardwork bore fruition I was struck by great grief, as a miasmic hue of orange and red scorched the land of my favourite ball of star stuff. Those who called themselves Humanity, only moments away from reaching galactic sentience, had annhilated all below in a pointless bout of mutually assured destruction, leaving but ruins and hardy insects to adorn the planet. 10/10 for extra realism bonus.

												Personally, this game is shaping up to be the perfect blend between Paradox's normal ""Grand Strategy Games"" and 4X Civilization types.  Being an intense Civilization fan, I've always found the games to lack a certain depth and scale to them.  Being a similarly intense fan of games like EU4 and CK2, I've always found they lacked the explore and developmental cycles found in Civilization games.  A yin and a yang if you will - which caused me to always only partially scratch the itch I wanted to scratch when I played either genre of the game.To me, Stellaris fixes that.  Its combination of 4X aspects, along with the grand strategy level diplomacy, management and scale finally scratch that itch for me perfectly.  Yin and yang working in harmony.Does the game have a few things that need tweaking? Absolutely.  The AI needs some adjusting to be a bit more involved and logical on its alliance and federation diplomacy, and the races traited towards dominance and war need to be a bit more blood thirsty and aggressive.  For what its worth, we're two days into release and Paradox has already patched minor issues and is listening to the community to address any further tweaks that may be needed.Regardless, its absolutely worth your money if these types of games are for you.  Having been a customer of Paradox for years now, I am truly excited to how much further they can and will take this game.			"

Posted: November 30, 2016
												I really wanted to give this game a positive review. I put in a ton of hours playing it and I love some of paradox's other games. I love strategy games in general. Over 500 hours on Crusader Kings. Over a month worth of hours on the Total War Franchise. I've played and loved strategy since getting my hands on Age of Empires as a kid. I even play Dota. Therefore it pains me to write this negative review for a game that I really wanted to love. But here it is:There are too many things broken with the base game to justify spending money on it.*Lets go through how a player would normally play the game and go over everything I've found that led to this review. Imagine it in Mr. Plinkett's voice if it helps get you through the wall of text that is to come. Oh, and there will be SPOILERS. You've been warned.Part One: Everyone hates racistsSpecies designing is an awesome idea. Collecting the atributes that make your race unique lets you play the game your way. But there are traits that are just not beneficial, and cost the same amount of trait points as other, clearly superior ones. The best example of this is the xenphobes trait. If you want to play with efficiency in mind, there's only a few viable paths to do down. This becomes extremely evident on harder difficulties. Part Two: No Building Queue, Electric BoogalooSo you colonized a new planet? Good for you! Now you get to set up the colony and get to work building buildings. But wait, did you research a bunch of upgrades for your generators and what not? Good! You'll get to remind yourself of that every time you upgrade each farm by a teir. And your power plants. And your mines. And all your other buildings. Without the ability to queue up multiple upgrades for the same building, you'll get to go back to it each time and pat yourself on the back for what an amazing job you did in researching that upgrade! This is across every planet you directly control. All of which have between 10 and 19 building slots. I think I saw a planet once with 23. Oh, and none of the upgrade chains branch out at all. So you just get to click upgrade a bunch of times. An ai could do it. But not this ai!! Which brings me to....Part Three: Artificial Intelligence, Real StupidityThe Ai in this game is like a brain damaged 3 year old. This is going to be the longest section, so buckle down, grab some popcorn, and put away your wallets. I'll start with the first toddler in these computerized special olympics: settlement ai. So you have an arbitrary cap on how many planets you can manage. This cap is pretty reasonable, since it also happens to be around the point where it becomes increadibly teadious to micro all your systems. The game's solution to this is to add extra systems you acquire into ai governed sectors, that automate the building and upgrading for you. This is a good idea in theory: you put initial supplies into their stockpiles and they develop based on a selected focus. Eventually they theoretically grow into self sustaining states that pay you a portion of their resources. You can even assign governors to give all the systems in a sector a nice bonus. But the problem is that often times the ai will not build anything on some tiles on the planets you give them. The population keeps growing and eventually can start starving if the ai didn't build enough farms. You can't order any building projects on those planets either. And revoking them from the ai costs 25 of a certain resource that you only get 0-3 of every month. That resource is also used for stuff like colonizing, building outposts and certain improvements, and establishing protection pacts and certain other diplomatic treaties, and more. Also, the sectors can only give you 75% of their montly resources, and the rest they put into their stockpiles. These become full and the 25% that gets put into them is lost. You cannot remove anything from the stockpiles either. Ai in SPACE SpaceSpace space... Combat. So in this game you get to design ships to counter the designs of your enemy. Its a step up from rock-paper-scissors combat, and is a pretty cool feature. Of course, its ruined by the ai not being able to design ships for♥♥♥♥♥♥ Their ships are horrible frankensteinian creations, inefficient and are not in any way designed to work alone, or together as a fleet. You'll begin to notice this when you're fighitng enemy ships, but it becomes really obvious when you are either engaged against the big bad engame threat, or are in a shudder Federation. I'll devote a section to each, since its that bad.Part Four: I don't want to live anymoreThe end game is broken. I faced the hive mind Tyranid invasion and I was stoked! Oh man, I thought, here comes someone that finally can challenge my fleets better than my punching bag neighbors. Even if it was just sheer numbers, I didn't care! They entered the galaxy from the north, took a few systems from some poor sod, and I saw their fleets starting to spread across the region. I was ready to kick some hive minded♥♥♥♥♥ but then.... they all stopped. They decided to start siegning and bombarding planets and... waiting. Waiting for what? It took me a while to find out, and after I did, I stopped playing. At first I thought the rest of the galaxy finally started fighting back. But after a while, I went out to explore, and I saw THIS[i.imgur.com] and THIS[i.imgur.com]. I was so sad that I made THIS[i.imgur.com]. Its a frowny face made of corpses. The other two pictures are of a bunch of colony ships just floating, not colonizing. They didn't try to escape when I attacked them either. They just sat there. Maybe when they arrived, the Tyranids saw how badly designed the game was, and just wanted to die. WHo knOWs? Then I saw the other reason their fleets were just hovering in orbit. I followed an invasion fleet from one of their worlds, to the capital planet of the empire their pre-generated forces kicked the snot out of. What you are about to see is the terrible legion of the end-game ai: https://i.imgur.com/PmRc2wg.jpg https://i.imgur.com/cGzq8Ff.jpgThis happened several times before, and continued for another hour before I saved the galaxy by shutting of the game.Part Five: Federations are the most dissapointing thing since No Man's SkyAi in federations are a mess, like so much else in this game. They design terrible ships for the federation fleet, and then the game decides that that their designs are superior when determining what gets upgraded into what. Ai that start wars sometimes never end them, even at 100% warscore. I'm sure this is a bug, but its so damn annoying I'm mentioning it here. There is no way to influence the ai to vote in on your measures if they don't already agree. There was so much potential for diplomacy here, but nope. Part Six: When will this review end already??The game ends when you have taken control of around half of the galaxy's habitable planets, or taken the capital of every enemy empire. This becomes a problem when you're playing as a pacifist, or you just don't want to take the time to conquer the galaxy 3 planets at a time. Yep, when you declare a war, no matter who its against or how badly you win, you can only take at most 3 (possibly 4...) planets at a time, and then get forced into peace. I actually hit the limit on the length of this review, so de-ded-ded Dat's All Folks! * If you are the kind of guy (or gal) that likes to spend hours on the mod page, and doesn't care about playing on Ironman, then you might find some solace in the amazing amount of workshop support for this game. But I can't recommend a broken game where the developers don't bother to fix issues that have been there since launch.			"

												Yes. Sorry, I assume you were asking whether you should get this game? I assume you like 4X (and have a PC that can run it) since you were looking at the reviews and all you need to know on that front is ""yes"" you should. Stellaris takes Paradox's grand strategy feel into space and does it really well giving you a good deal of customisation of your race including, importantly, ethics that strong influence how you interact with other race (spiritualists don't like materialists and no-one likes a xenophobe). If I were to give it a score (out of 10) personally I'd like to give it a 9 but I can see a strong argument for an 8 based on a few bugs, unfinished features and gameplay plateaus that I am sure Paradox will fix/fill in a timely fashion.It's a great game, the only main issues are some bugs (mostly pretty minor so nothing to mention compared to most releases these days) and a fairly passive AI who plays war much more defensively than they could and a mid-game plateau where little of interest happens unless you are playing a very militaristic expansionistic empire. Additionally it is worth noting that the 'revolt' feature - particuarly important to slaves and races dependant on them, has not been implemented due to lack of time. Right now you can enslave away without fear of slave revolts and it is disappointing that this feature was cut froim release even if Paradox do intend to roll it out soon after. These are issue I have faith will be filled based on Paradox's previous titles (faith based on evidence - should have probably used a different word, oh well) and the game itself is still incredibly fun even for these failings. Now something I have to sing massive praise for Paradox for doing is the accessibility. Stellaris is incredibly easy to get into - there is a small advisor bot (who is helpfully voiced and is even amusing on occasion) who asks how much guidance you want when you start your first game. This alone with the early game 'missions' that walk you through some basic empire growing steps really helps push new players in the right direction. If you have ever had issues getting in Europa Universalis IV or Crusader Kings II you are fully justified - those Paradox games offer no manual, no tutorial, no guidance and are downright obscure at times (apart from Paradox's ever helpful dedication to tooltips which I love) - Stellaris however just works. You can pick Stellaris up and play - no YouTube guides or LPs needed (although you'd be remiss if you didn't watch my excel- ahem, where was I?). Stellaris is likely to be the Paradox gateway drug for players new to their titles.If you love 4X or Paradox games, then this is certainly the game for you. Does it have some flaws? Sure, but not too major and ones I do believe will be fixed in the near future. Does it have some bugs? Sure, the lack of upgradeable warp drives on troop transports is particularly egregious. But these are issues that will be gone within the month most likely and Paradox has a long history of supporting their titles with updates, fixes and optional DLC. Get it.-EE(p.s. Yes I focus on negatives more than I should with great games but that's because I want them to be perfect so bad!)			"

												The year is 2387, and the galactic community is on the verge of extinction.The Prethoryn Scourge came to the Milky Way galaxy in 2368, in isolated pockets which were quickly dealt with by the Outer Rim empires. But everything would change, the main force arrived only 3 months after.At the beginning, the galaxy united together to fight off the Scourge, but setback after setback, the Scourge pushed deep into the galaxy within the next four years, assimilating all forms of biomass they could find and eradicating any resistance that stood in their way. At first, it was the smaller, weaker empires that went first, the cannon fodder while the major galactic powers consolidated their forces and entrenched their worlds and secured their borders.But then, the Scourge targeted the two Fallen Empires in the galaxy. The galactic community all sighed in relief, the Scourge would surely be annihilated in mere moments against the powers of the Fallen Empires. But within the next couple of weeks, the Fallen Empires fell silent, with infected ships pouring out from their borders. The Scourge had assimilated the Fallen Empires, and now nothing could stop them. The galaxy was stunned.The panic set in all across the galaxy, a once unified galaxy, now fractured as Empires began fending for themselves. As the Scourge advanced, some some species thought they would kill themselves rather than become a twisted horror of the Scourge. Entire Empires were wiped from existence as they nuked themselves into oblivion, committing mass suicide with casualties reaching into the billions.Over the course of the next 20 years, many Empires would stage a brave final stand at their homeworlds, fighting until the bitter end before being snuffed out like a flame from existence. During the 2380s, the United Nations of Earth were one of the last remaining empires still militarily capable of fighting the Scourge, but by 2386, the UNE had lost a majority of their colonies to the Scourge, billions dead or transformed into nightmarish horrors. In 2387, humanity staged their final stand in the Sol System, having lost contact with most of their allies, they accepted the fact they were now alone. The first engagments of the Battle of Sol were small. Small scout fleets entered the system and were quickly destroyed by the remnants of the United Nations Earth Defence Fleet (UNEDF). The first major Scourge fleets were dealt by layers of defence platforms and fortresses built across the entire system, with most of the outer Sol system mined, it was an absolute death trap and would've been considered suicide to assault, but the Scourge had no fear. Within months, the Scourge had broken through the the layers of defensive placements and now directly besieged the worlds of Earth and Mars. The UNEDF was mostly ruin, reduced to a few corvettes, destroyers and cruisers.The fighting on the surface of Earth and Mars was terrifying. Entire armies annihilated by hordes of the Scourge's abominations. The capital city of Earth, Geneva was lost within hours of the planetary invasion, now reduced to nuclear ash. The date is November 11th, 2387, Humanity's grand fleet and army continue to fight desperately in their home system, heroically defending their homeworld against the endless onslaught of the Prethoryn Scourge, hoping for an impossible miracle, or die trying. This, is the galaxy's last stand.			"

												tl;dr: Stellaris in my opinion is a game that has potential but overall feels unfinished.It's basically a union of the average 4X and the grand strategy Paradox are so good at. Let's go through it one feature at a time.The early game is great. The exploration phase and finding anomalies is beyond promising, there's even questlines for that RPG feel. Most importantly though, it's fleshed out. Anomalies paint a picture that give the galaxy some depth, which is why the early game is so damn good. As for the questlines, they have potential but I have yet to finish one because of lack of border access once I get boxed in. Pirates appeared after I founded my first colony, with an event to come with it. They attacked my colony, I attacked them and destroyed their base, after that Pirates never bothered me ever again. Which was weird.The transition to mid-game is nothing short of rough. Suddenly, there's nowhere left in the galaxy to explore because I'm boxed in between two empires that are much stronger than me. I also had to start handing control over to sectors, which is AI that manages colonies so I don't have to micromanage my empire when I have hundreds of them. Don't even get me started on the AI, but the main purpose of sectors is to give rebels who want independence a clear goal, which is to secede an entire sector. Though they can be easily paid off with some bribes. The tech tree is alright. It's extensive, I'll give it that. The idea is that every time you finish a tech, you have 3 options. Each time those 3 are semi-random, like drawing from a set of cards. It's a pretty good idea, but it makes it difficult to plan ahead when it's semi-random each time. You also get ""Rare"" technologies that aren't rare at all. I got an achievement for researching 10 rare techs in one game, being my first game. There isn't much to be said about pops or buildings. It's very much like Civilization V where you assign citizens to work certain tiles, but it's in space. Buildings enhance those tiles. But to get better buildings you have to improve your capital building, which requires a certain amount of pops to do so. This means small planets are essentially useless. Mining is straight-forward. You build mining stations or research stations wherever you can. As long as you can balance resources that is.Of course, there is also Ethics. Ethics are what shapes your empire. Are you peaceful, or warlike? Are you a Xenophile, or a Xenophobe? Are you a Collectivist, or an Individualist? Again, it's a good idea, but it's not done properly. Ethics as a whole feels like it's more about what you can't do that what you can do. It limits the gameplay by letting very specific ethics do specific things. What's that, you found a level 4 anomaly giving you an extremely high tech ship? Oh wait, I'm a Xenophobe, trash it and get some influence (This actually happened to me). Despite being militeristic, I had only one option in that event. I didn't have a choice about what to do witht that ship, which was infuritating. So when you have one ability that requires one ethic, it leaves the rest out in the cold. And with diplomacy, every single empire you meet gives you the same set of responses based on your ethics, which don't mean anything as far as I know, but it's still repetitive. Which brings me to my next point. Now for the main problem with this game, interacting with other Empires. Everything about it feels unfinished. Midgame overall is a slog, and the barebone diplomacy and lack of internal politics definitely doesn't help. Empires can build alliances with each other. If you have at least 4 members of that alliance you can become what is known as a Federation. No, not Star Trek-style federation. It's just a glorified alliance that gives the leader more say and everyone else even less to do. Trade is almost non-existant. There's no trade routes, and the AI doesn't seem to understand how to accept or decline deals properly. Warfare is completely broken. At least with AI. You're supposed to fight like your average Space war. Fleets attack fleets, Orbital bombardment, invading planets, etc. But sadly it doesn't work. Enemy AI essentially chases you around which makes it easy to tie up a much larger fleet with a tiny one. Allied AI does the same thing. They follow your largest fleet with their entire force, even if it's twice the size of yours. And while the enemy might leave a few fleets lying around, the allied AI literally uses their entire fleet. Which means that I have to do everything. Broken warfare made me quit my first game, in fact. And at last we come to Late game. So the idea of the Late game is that as you research more and more advanced techs, they become riskier. This culminates in an End game crisis. For example, you can research techs that allow you to build robot pops. And as time goes on, technology allows these pops to become more and more efficient. Eventually though, as you'd expect, the robots become self aware and rebel once they become less of toasters (Stellaris AI) and more as advanced intelligence. Currently, there are 3 End game Crisis'. 1. Robots. They're unstoppable. They outproduce and outresearch everyone. You may be able to fight off their initial revolt, but eventually they will defeat someone and take over their empire, and from there it's a death sentence. 2. Extradimensional invaders known as the Unbidden. These appear if you research and use the Jump Drive, a late game tech. Sadly, it's broken because the Empires' AI don't seem to be aware of the threat and therefore don't unite against them. In fact, they don't fight back at all. The only way to defeat the Unbidden is by destroying the portal they came through.3. And finally, Extragalactic invaders known as the Prethoryn Swarm. They appear when you do neither of the above. They're pretty much the same as the Unbidden, but instead of a portal, you have to capture their queen to defeat them. They infect planets with their infective...ness and have to be bombarded to cure. Again, the AI are too dumb to understand the threat the Prethoryn pose. And worse yet, the Prethroyn are also dumb, and don't do anything after the initial invasion of a single empire. This is the only one I've experienced so far, so the other two might be the same.The End game crisis is a great idea, but again, it isn't executed properly. Which is a shame because it's really set apart from your average 4X in that respect. All that being said, there are two things that I absolutely love about this game. Fallen Empires. Fallen Empires are basically remnants from past empires that are completely stagnant, but are much, much, MUCH more advanced, numerous, and overall powerful than everyone else, at least until the Late game. They look down on everyone and each have their own special way of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥them off. Which if you do, you're toast. Overall they add a unique aspect to the balance of power and are indeed pre-established empires, which I think is very cool.On the other end of the spectrum we have Primitive Civilization. These are pre-FTL species that can range anywhere between Neolithic and Early Space Age. They have many different scenarios and events to spice things up. Like an equivilent to World War 2 for example. Or a nuclear holocaust. And what's more, you can infiltrate their governments to prepare for annexation, or you can technologically uplift them. Or you could just wipe them out if you're feeling especially bloodthirsty today.Back to the point though. Stellaris was a fun game when I first played it. A little boring, yes. But everything was new. But it was all the game had to offer, sadly. It's likely part of Paradox's DLC plan, but that's beside the point. The game is there, but it needs fleshing out. So if I were you, I'd wait a while for the patches and DLC to come, then I'd consider buying it. But at launch, I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												A competent entry in the otherwise barren space 4X genre. Very strong early game, but the mid- to late-game is a gameplay wasteland.Stellaris borrows a lot of core gameplay ideas from other Clausewitz engine titles, but it feels as though Paradox forgot every lesson they learned while iterating those games - a cynic might speculate that such iterative improvements were deliberately left out of Stellaris to be repackaged and sold as DLC add-ons, but that remains mere speculation. Adding to that, several features are bugged or disabled, such as slave revolts and vassal rebellions(ie there is currently no penalty to enslaving pops or vassalizing other empires).As-is, Stellaris is a very bare-bones space 4X, lacking enough content for long-term gameplay value. Pass on it for now, check back in a few months to a year when the DLC lands(and this review will be updated).			"

												This game is my dream come true. This is the Distant Worlds 2 I was waiting for...If you are bored from all the other 4X games with no balls to give us something new and exciting, Stellaris is the game that delivers!Imagine Civilisation combined with space 4X game, throw grand strategy on top of it and its made by Paradox! This is how Distant Worlds should have looked from the get go. Love it!* Engaging diplomacy.* Excelent New game setup, the race options are spectacular.* Absolutely beatifull race avatars.* Huge galaxies.* Superb music, even Blade runner inspired theme!* No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t AI.* 4X and grand strategy in one package.* Slavery.* Real time with pause.* Non intrusive and nicely done UI compared to CK2.* Game is easy to get into but has a lot of depth!* Randomnes, not a single game will be the same.But there are also some things that do not work so well...- Game is build on an old engine with no 64bit support.- Battles could me more engaging ... maybe some DLC will change this?- DLC policy which may not suit everyone.- Game is stuttering when not paused... I suppose it will be solved in update.- Espionage and advanced trade options are missing at the moment... It will be surely part of upcoming DLCs.			"

												This game started off as quite fun. I like the idea behind it, but it definitely suffers from Paradox-Syndrome.Paradox-Syndrome is a disease in which games are born unfinished, with numerous gaps in content. Whilst pleasing to the eye and imagination, they are ultimately empty or unreplayable unless the player is willing to wait at least a year for patches, or worse to send more money for incremental improvements in the form of DLCs (which I see is the developing pattern here)I like the game, and my initial thoughts were that it was fun. After a second play through, however, you realise that tech trees are actually rather limited and there are only a few combinations of weapon worth equipping your ships with.In terms of story line, we were promised more mid-game developments. which have been introduced. Their effects, however, were limited. I had a race-war on one of my planets, but in all honesty, I didn't need to pay any attention to the results.So although I like this game, and like the ""style"" of paradox games in general, I really dispute their methods for brining games to market.

												Stellaris is Paradox’s first foray into sci-fi grand strategy and despite being rough around the edges they’ve created a great grand strategy/4X game. You begin the game by choosing or creating your own spacefaring race and then you gradually explore and expand around your starting system. You’ll quickly find interesting things to research, strange alien life forms and even other advanced races. Depending on your race’s traits, ethics and government type these races will quickly judge you and this early judgement often sets the kind of relationship you’ll have with them for the rest of the game.  Stellaris’ early-game phase it’s unquestionably when the game is at its best. Discovering what’s around you, meeting new races and planning your race’s expansion is quite exciting. You use science ships lead by one of your race’s scientists to survey systems which reveals what resources can be harvested there, occasionally you’ll find an anomaly that can be researched too. Anomalies, if successfully researched, will grant you helpful resources, such as more energy credits or resource points, but if the research fails it can sometimes have quite serious consequences.There are a few different resources for you to manage and you’ll need to secure a fair amount of them early on to aid your expansion. Energy Credits and Minerals are the two main resources. Energy Credits are mainly used for maintaining your units while Minerals are mainly used to construct new ships, armies and buildings. Next we have Influence. Influence is spent on colonizing new worlds, activating edicts on your planets to increase certain things and can also be used during elections/leader selection processes to choose the leader that will benefit you the most. With Energy Credits and Minerals you’ll quickly reach a point where you’re getting dozens per month but Influence comes at a much slower rate, you usually want it around +3 or +2 per month. There are several ways to get more Influence but there are several things which take Influence every month (such as Alliances and Frontier Outposts) and they're why you'll have such a low income. You also have Physics, Society and Engineering research points. While not as important as your other resources, it’s still important to improve your input of these three to decrease the time it takes for you to research new tech. Resources can be obtained using orbital mining/research stations or by constructing specific buildings on your planets’ surfaces.Stellaris’ tech tree isn’t a tech tree at all, but it works rather well. The technologies available for you to research in each of the three categories are randomly selected, though you’ll still need to research Biolab II before you can research Biolab III for example. Some of the techs are given ‘weight’ by the game which means they will always show up, while some techs will never appear (after 45 hours of playing a new tech came up for me that I hadn’t seen before). For example, the technology that allows you to colonize new worlds will always be one of the first three options for Society research.Once you’ve expanded out, got a fair few new technologies under your belt and met a few races, you’ll enter Stellaris’ mid-game. It sucks. The problem is, Stellaris’ diplomacy is still pretty rough and during the mid-game (unless you’re at war) you’ll go long periods of time without having to touch the game at all due to how long research takes to complete. The diplomacy options are very limited right now and they don’t really have much of an impact on the overall game. Generally speaking, every race will either kind of like you or absolutely hate you and while you can have Vassals, Protectorates and Tributaries, they also don’t have much of an impact on the game. And this is all after an update which focused on improving democracy. Unless you’re a war-loving race, Stellaris’ mid-game is far from being as good as it should be.War can be a lot of fun in Stellaris, particularly when you’re playing co-operatively with friends. When you decide to go to war with another race, you choose your war goals. These range from making the enemy into a Tributary (25% of their resource output goes to you) to ceding a planet so you can take control of it to something as simple as humiliating the other race. The different goals have an associated warscore value and the total warscore needed has to be 60 or lower for you to go to war. The warscore value depends on what the goal is, in the case of liberating or ceding a planet it depends on the size of the colony and in the case of making the race into a Tributary it depends on the overall size of the race. Once the war has begun, you increase your war score by destroying enemy fleets, blockading planets with fleets and by landing armies to occupy a planet. You can negotiate peace at any time during the war but what peace offerings will be accepted (by either side of the war) depend on how much positive or negative (if you’re losing) warscore you have. Before I talk about the game’s end-game phase, I’ll briefly return to traits, ethics and government types for your race. There are quite a lot of traits to choose from for your race but you can only choose up to four traits and you only have two trait points to work with. If you want more than just one or two traits you’ll need to include negative traits to balance out your positive traits. For ethics, you can choose three ethics but you’ll have to have at least two as you have to use all three of your ethic points. Each ethic has a normal version as well as a fanatic version. The fanatic version costs two ethic points and it doubles the positive and negative effects of the ethic. Based on what ethics you’ve chosen, you’ll then have to choose what type of government you have. Each type of government (there are twelve to choose from) has its own election/leader selection as well as buffs for your race. Your choice of traits does have some impact on how the game plays out but it’s your choice of ethics and government that really mixes things up. My first few races were fairly similar to each other so the gameplay felt very samey but when I switched up my ethics and government type to something vastly different it completely changed how the game plays which is great.Lastly, Stellaris’ currently broken/unbalanced late-game. The late-game portion of the game consists of a galaxy-wide crisis that involves a mysterious faction (there are two possibilities) invading the galaxy and quickly taking control of territory. Before the 1.2 Asimov update, by the late-game there would be a couple of federations and a few alliances in the galaxy you could team up with to take on the invaders and the invaders would usually have four or five 20K fleet power ships within a couple of years. Now though, the late-game crisis events are practically impossible. Since the 1.2 Asimov update I haven’t seen a single AI alliance and I haven’t seen any federations before the invaders arrive and when they do arrive they’re far too powerful to take on. In my most recent co-op game where I reached the late-game portion, myself and my friend were both fairly advanced and we had a combined fleet power of around 50K. After Asimov, the invaders now start with a few 60K fleets! Where we would have been able to at least defend our territory if not push into the invader’s territory, we now get instantly crushed if we try and take them on. Verdict The mid-game lacks depth. The late-game is unbalanced. Despite these things, Stellaris manages to be an incredibly enjoyable grand strategy/4X game. There’s a lot of work that still needs to be done by Paradox but Stellaris is already a hell of a lot of fun.Lone Ranger Reviews.El K.			"

												Let me start by saying that I enjoy 4x and strategy games in general but often lack the patience to actually take the time to learn all of their mechanics therefore in the end loving the idea of the game more than actually playing it.  Often I'll get into a game such as this and either get frustrated with it in some way or feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of content to wade through in order to know if the first ship that I created was done so properly.  Stellaris for me has been the exception to that.  My friend asked me to play this game with him and I told him sure but don't expect me to stick with it and as of this writing we are now planning weekly games sometimes lasting six hours per session.So I'll start by saying that I love the mechanics of this game in almost every way.  This is a 4x game that runs in real time but you don't feel like you are micro managing every unit like a traditional RTS, it's a very good hybrid approach.  To elaborate on that point, when you send a fleet of ships into combat, you aren't controlling several squads of ships in real time, you tell which fleets you want to fight to engage and then they all just jump in and fight it out unless you command them to retreat.   This simplfies the combat mechanic more than some typically enjoy but in general makes this game less about players ability to control lots of units and more about the strategy needed before combat begins.  Combat in Stellaris is important as is the design and power of your ships but it's not the key focus.Stellaris is a strategy game that's focus is truly strategy.  One cannot simply work towards researching the most powerul hardware and expect to win because you can't just declare war and steam roll through an empire.  War is a carefully planned process that requires demands to be set and met win or lose.  If I declare war on another nation then I have to openly state that I want planets, to vasalize them, demand liberation of a nation or other similar options.  After the war is declared and demands set the war begins and each side has a score value that must be met.  That score can be achieved in a number of different ways but once it reaches 100% then the victor earns their demands and the declaring party cannot declare war on that nation again for 10 game years and a lot can happen in that time.  The losing party could build up relations with other empires to prevent the next war for example.Another aspect that I really enjoy are the mechanics in the game that reduce a lot of the micro management tedium.  One example of this is the Outliner that appears on the right hand side of the UI.  If not for this one UI element, I'm not sure I would enjoy the game nearly as much because it helps to expidite so many functions of the game.  It essentially provides a breakdown of the key units and areas you are actively managing and makes it very easy to quickly access them and see what they are doing.  If I have three science ships on three different tasks, I can easily see their progress and can quickly navigate to their current location.  I can at a glance see each of my fleets, planets, sectors, opposing factions, etc.  The entire panel can also be customized to your needs or even hidden if you don't like it.The creation of sectors is also of great importantance and goes a long way to eliminate the tedium of micro managing planets.  Once you get more than five planets (in vanilla), you must start to create system sectors or you suffer penalties.  Once the systems are in sectors, you set the options for the sector and it has it's own resources and manages the planets building queues, production and populations on it's own.  This is major because once you get to 7-8 planets it can become a real chore keeping up with everything they need.  Sectors can set their production focus, can have their own rulers, their contributions can be defined and more.  For me, this is what makes the game playable.Multiplayer is also amazing in this game.  A game can consist of up to 32 players and can run at normal or faster speeds.  Players can join in pacts and federations as well as create trade agreements and contribute to others conflicts.  Or of course can just play free for all and wreck each other.  Be aware that there are still some bugs with multiplayer that require the host to reload the game from time to time but games can be saved to any of the players and someone else can host if need be.Other small details....The achievements can only be earned in single player iron man mode so that's something to be aware of too if that's something you enjoy.This isn't a game that is normally played in one to two hours.  If a game is that short then things went horribly wrong..or right depending on which player you are.  This game will often last for days or possibly weeks depending on the game setup.  That fact alone might tell you if you do or don't want to play it, so bear that in mind as well.  .You can create your own custom races as with other games of this type but the creation system is very intuitive and adds a lot to the game for me.Players also need to manage their ships.  You can customize your ship's componets in great detail or leave it up to the AI to automatically manage them for you.  Overall, you have better builds if you manage them yourself but it isn't required to play the game.Players also are not assured a win by researching a specific tree.  Research is randomized and you are given three choices initially to choose from each time you start to research a new project.  This is one of the great equalizers in the game because it forces the player to carefully balance their empire focus.  For some reading this, that may sound like a negative but it actually adds a great mechanic to the game.So, in short, if traditional strategy or RTS games aren't your thing, give Stellaris a look.  Watch some YouTube videos, live streams, Let's Plays or something similar for a while and see the mechanics in action.  Watching for 5-10 minutes might not give you enough of a feel for it, so give it some time.  I wish they had a demo of this game out so anyone that's curious about it could actually try it out and see how great it is.  There is no shortage of 4x and strategy games on the market, but Stellaris stands out and creates a fresh new experience.			"

												I have played many Paradox games in the past, EUIV, CKII, Victoria II, and even HOI III (although I didnt like it much). I have spent well over 1000 hours in these games combined, so my expectations were high. Stellaris delivered though, it is everything I could have hoped for and more. I expect to play this game for hundreds of hours to come. I have never reviewed a game before (even my beloved CKII), but I thought this was well worth the effort.			"

												I am an avid Paradox fan.I have 800 hours on Vic 2,800 hours on Europa IV,I'm currently loving HOI4.Stellaris is a game i was very excited for, more so than any other Paradox game.But after about 60 hours I have finally decided to rest upon ""Utterly Abyssmal""There are many reasons for this, but I would say the NUMBER ONE REASON:Automation.You are barely in control at all.You get 5 planets, you are forced to use the clunky - not fun ""Sector Control""and outside of gameplay; The PEACE TREATIES: are Automatic.Example:-You get declared war on-You start to mobilize-The enemy gets up to X% warscore-But you start to fight back-You start to win-You start to take back your lands-The AI Declares peace-You AUTO accept because its within his current warscore-You just lost even though you were about to steamroll him-Your people, buildings, planets, mining outposts; remain ravaged and destroyed and all for no reward-he still gets his wargoal-ALL because YOU dont get to choose when the war ends. You have no say.This game has very positive reviews, and i'm glad those people are able to find joy in this game.To those who dare buy I wish you good gaming.-A severely disappointed fan---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After Utopia and Leviathans and all the addons and fixes i will upgrade this to recommended. Price tag is hefty but it makes things alot better.			"

												Goes from exciting to being a chore. Knowing Paradox's usual business model, this is going to get a ton of DLC, and I feel that until they release something dealing with the barebones mid to late game, this isn't worth getting. Don't get sucked into the hype. The beginning is fantastic and there is so much potential here.			"

												To start the review, I have to confess that I wasn't a good paradox fan till last year ---- I  played  cracked version of their games for years, HOI2, EU3, VIC2, HOI3,EU4,CK2, etc. That's my sin and I redeemed it by buying almost all of them in recent 2 years. I feel I could say farewell to my Pirate gaming days and be a legal and good gamer with respect.Thus I bought Stellaris on launch day, with full pirce, as the first such try in my gaming experience with Paradox.I played it as crazy, till 40 hours later when a strong feeling of being fooled stormed my mind.This game, as in its current status, though with best graphics in Paradox games, is only skeleton, fleshless and souless.I only state one of its many problems: lack of content.The early game could be fun, meaning you explore and expand and plan cautiously. Yet after a certain point, there's nothing left to do except repeatitive micro management. There is no advanced development, since you can only manage 5 to 7 stars and building types are quite limited.There is no advanced governance, since most of your empire has to be governed by ""Sectors"", but you only have minimum interactions with them, like energy focus and mineral focus. Plus their AI is dumb as hell. There is no intense fighting, since: 1. Corvette is extremly OP, you don't really need bigger ships. 2. Formation, Tactics, Strategy, Supply Lines,Morale and meaningful Defence Facilities don't exist. 3. Combat AI doesn't exist as well. The only model of war is : Chase your enemy all around the map (due to no supply lines and real defence or chokepoint)- Grind them automatically(no tactics, formation, morale)- Land troops on their planet, repeat. After your doomstack finishes their doomstack, war is in fact over. No rebuilding a proper fleet, no guerrilla tactics, no desperate defence of their home planet, nothing.Thre is no politics, since the only functional factions are only separatists and you can easily crack down their hopless revolt by adding more cheap garrisons. No cry for the change of government, no pursuit for another religion, no independence desire from sectors, nothing.There is no trade, literally. No you can't ship extra food from one planet to another, you can't build markets or trading posts, let alone trade routes, you don't have any ethics or government types with anything raleted to the concept of TRADE.There is no espionage, literally. No spy, no steal tech, no incite revolt, no support independence, nothing.There is no advanced diplomacy, since only really functional options are war and alliance-federation(without it there's almost no way for fleet access and tech co-operation ), while the later is unfinished and bugged. You want crisis system in Vic 2? H.R.E system in EU 3/4? Feudal relationships in CK2? Sorry but you must be dreaming. Yes there are some end game crisises, like the Mongol invasion in CK2. But in this universe, no one really cares.And above is only my incomplete conclusion of one of major problems of this game.   I know Paradox fanboys would argue: ""It's just normal for Paradox's game on release status. Paradox will gradually patch the game and add more and more contents to it over time.""But the issue is they made a shallow beta with just too few features and contents and sell it as if it's finished. Then, maybe 1 or 2 years later, after several Overprieced DLC milking.  We, as their free QA employees, will finally get the ""FULL GAME"" after paying maybe 100 or 200 bucks, with tears and gratitude.I have admired the ambition of Stellaris and looked foward to promises made by Paradox. I have tried to understand and tolerate the DLC milking practice made by Paradox, since its base games at least seem finished and are even with some suprisingly good features. Sadly, It seems it's a new routine for devs to release unfinished games with full pirce and charge players for so called ""DLCs"" which are actully cut-off contents of base game. Paradox is just one of them.Suddenly I feel guilty of buying a full priced legal game for the first time, not for the loss of 40 bucks, but for my openly contirbution to the suicidal greed of a once wonderful game developer.

												Things Stellaris is not:Europa UniversalisVictoriaCrusader KingsHearts of IronThings Stellaris IS:An awesome and well fleshed out space empire sim that delves into the ethical standpoint and racial attributes of space-fairing empires. It has a very Star Trek and Mass Effect feel to it, where one race is a ""warrior race"", and another is a collectivist hive with no individuality.Stellaris supports any sci-fi space opera dream you could come up with. Want the Arachnid Collective to finally put an end to that pesky fascist Human Federation? Now you can. You want to build the Borg, ingratiate yourself to them, and assist them on a machine crusade throughout the galaxy? Go for it.You want to rip holes in space and time, and accidentally let the things that live between the folds of reality through? Sure.You want to be a pacifistic, peacable empire spreading a grand federation across the galaxy? You want to blow up space whales to learn their secrets? You want to genetically toy with a primitive species? All are available. Some say that Stellaris is a mile wide, and an inch deep. I disagree with this. Stellaris is still an extremely deep and enjoyable game with a wide variety of playstyles. What Stellaris does different is an elegence and efficiency of design that cuts out the fluff, and leaves the meat.			"

												This game just isn't it for me.  If you're ok with just building up massive fleets and going at it with very long rebuild delays in-between...then you might like it.  There's simply not enough to do during peace time.  No trading, no espionage, and not enough real diplomacy options.  Sure, you can pick a peaceful, pacifist culture and try that route but what's the point?  A wormhole will jus open up at the end game and pour out massive fleets.  You really have no other option than just building up a war time posture and fighting with everything you have in the end. I want to like this game.  It has some very good elements and I believe with some work, this game could be great.			"

												I`m 313 hours into Stellaris.  I haven´t completed it, but I believe I can give a pretty good impression of the game.This review includes ALL the DLCs, up to and including Utopia.Stellaris is one of those unique games where random♥♥♥♥♥♥happens so often that one game can feel like several new playthroughs. Over 300 hours into the game, I still often find brand new things happening  in single player and multiplayer modes.You start with a single planet and a few people.  From there, you go off to take over the universe. You will encounter everything from space dragons, horrors of the void and pirates that will try to kill you. For that matter, half of the universe will also attempt to kill or devour you. The rest wanna make friends or simply breed you out of history.Going into Stellaris, it is important to know that this is NOT a game you will finish in a day or a week.  It's a game where you should take your time and really learn and understand what is going on. It´s a game where every choice you make for your population affects the outcome of the game.Reasearch, building, military and social aspects of your population are by your command. There are a million tools to reach your goal, so you get to pick whatever you want.You wanna be a insane warmonger ? Sure, go ahead, You wanna be a spiritual leader who believes in peace ? Sure, go ahead. You wanna be the most tech-savvy scientist and have every population below you ? Sure, go ahead.You wish to enslave the entire world and feel like a king with slaves ? Sure, go ahead.You wanna be a complete asshat and purge people who disagree with you ? Sure, go ahead.Stellaris lets you truly customize according to your whims and rule the universe as you like, which is great.Design your own race, from appearance to values.Design your own ships, with weapons, shields, and FTL drives.Design your own planets with terraforming and much more.Gameplay and graphics are amazing, complemented by a soundtrack that promotes relaxation on your journey into space.Stellaris is strongly recommended for people who love complex, long-running GRTS games.

												After many years of Steam, I think this is the first time I feel the need to write a review. But before the review, a small timeline: 6:00 PM: Got home from work, started the download, made some dinner, took a nap (didn't think it would be that small, +1). 7:30 PM: Started playing. Blinked. 10:00 PM: After the blink, my sister called and asked for a ride. 11:00 PM: Resumed playing. Blinked again. 03:00 AM: Is it midnight yet? I checked the time on my phone and remembered I had to get up at 7AM. With great sadness, I saved the game and turned the computer off. 09:30 AM: Took a break from work and am now writing this. Can't stop thinking about my empire.Now on to the review!I seriously can't remember when was the last time I completely lost track of time when playing a game that is so immersive like Stellaris! I think it was when Civ V came out, or maybe Skyrim, but none of those kept me so away from the real world and so focused on what was happening in the game! I seriously loved it! I remember when I first played a 4x space game, I really wanted to like it, but something was missing from it (Distant Worlds). And the same thing happened with all others I tried afterwards. But not Stellaris. This game achieves perfect balance of features, complexity and simplification. It has everything I always wanted on a 4x space game, without any annoyances seen on other games!Some of the pros: Excellent learning curve: Simple at first, gets as complex as you are willing to dig in. Micromanagement balance: In the beggining there is a lot, but you have few things to manage, so it's ok (and interesting). Later on, exactly when you start to feel overwhelmed, you learn how to automate planets, by creating sectors). Interesting races! Don't be fooled by the small number of species! Each empire you encounter can be a lot different from each other, even if they are of the same major species (avian, reptiles, mammal, etc). Superb writing! Every anomaly finding, every faction conversation, reasearch projects, ""quests"", and even descriptions are worth reading! Makes me regret not getting the Galaxy edition, because of the e-book. Graphics: they are very cool, a lot more detailed than what is usually the standard for 4x games. Sounds and music: Not once I felt the music was boring or repetitive. Sounds are nice, and not those that get tiring after a while and makes you just want to turn the volume down. Difficulty: I think the normal dif setting is perfect for new players. I encountered a religious fanatic empire very early in the game, and they quickly declared themselves rivals of my technocratic empire. A cold war started, and eventually I thought I could overpower them and declared war. It's amazing how balanced our fleets were! I won most battles, but each one of them were really, really close! Eventually they surrendered, right when I was about to give up. Simply amazing. Customization options: There are a lot of possibilities of customizatiom, from your empire details, to the ship designs. I felt like I only scratched the surface of the possibilities. Probably more stuff that I don't remember now.Now for the cons... No central galactic black hole Can't put down Makes me feel like none of the other games on my Steam account matters anymore.Overal: 10/10. If you're still on the fence with this game, my advice is that you buy it now, you won't regret it!			"

												I sadly have to agree with the reviews I've read online (and ignored and am regretting it now). It's the kind of game you want to love, but just can't.The game is well set up, providing a really nice set of mechanics. When you start the game and try it out, it seems great - it has research, it has exploration, space anomalies with interesting texts, even quest chains of sort (even though it's basically always ""go to system and reserach there"". You have factions and different species with changing ethics. Hence why the initial reviews here are very positive.Problem is that once you've played your first 5 hours and surveyed your first 50 systems, there's suddenly nothing left to do. Enemy empires are passive to say the least, they just squat in their corner of space and ignore you. Resources management is fun at first when you're lacking minerals or energy and need to build new facilities on your worlds and juggle population between them. Alas, as your empire grows, price of development doesn't scale with income, so at some point you stop bothering, since it doesn't really matter if you build a new mine or not, there's nothing to put your resources into anyway (except spamming battleships you don't really need). Colonization loses its appeal, since to colonize new planets, you need to automate some you already have. Factions never do anything. Ethics don't matter.So at some point instead of ""one more turn"", you catch yourself asking ""why am I even still playing?"". And at that point you quit and realize you feel no urge to start playing again.I'm dearly hoping for some tweaking that would add some internal and external challanges and would get me busy managing my empire again. Maybe a patch, maybe a datadisk - while I'll be more skeptic, I'm going to buy it if I see good feedback on game websites. I really really want this game to be good. But so far, it isn't.			"

												First a basic TL;DR good game but has flaws.Ok let me start by saying I really like this game, which actually makes it all the more painful that its flaws are so pronounced, and lets be honest been around for ages, since I bought the game actually.The biggest issue I have is Sector AI. You cannot get around using them if you want to expand. They absolutely hate using their own resource stockpile, I have my oldest sector with 200k energy and minerals last I checked (that was probably 50+ years ingame ago) yet they love taking my resources off me to destroy the planets in their control. You will lose planets you give them from rebelling first thing you will know about it is when you see the map as they regularly starve your population or overfeed them (don't be suprised if one planet has +40 food and another has -12 food the AI just loves doing that).War demands are pathetic and too limited. Want to take out another empire thats big, well it will take countless wars, doesnt matter if you get them to cede planets or liberate them (more on that later). Because when you get you 2-5 worlds on average you cannot attack them again for another 10 in game years. So better hope they dont have 50-100 worlds else, well enjoy the long war.Liberation......yeah it can be viable if you pause the game the second you win the war to make them a vassal or the likes because if you don't well the AI will snatch them back up instantly.Ground combat is beyond boring, seriously you put ships in orbit, pop their shields land your troops (can do it before but will take more troops) watch the health go down on both sides, whoever runs out of troops first wins. Btw did I meantion the troops are simply an icon with a health bar that circles it, yeah very engaging ground battles. A feature very easy to over look is the troop attachments, to install them you need to land them planet side, click on the troop, click the attachment, click on the next repeat. For each one, its fine early game where you might have 20-50 troops but late game where you can litterally have 400+ troops its well not really worth it no bulk upgrades like on ships, atleast not what I can find, it took me long enough to find out where the attachments were.Space battles, well atleast you can min-max customise your fleet (to a kind of limited extent) to counter your latest enemy. But you cant specifically target any of their ships so better hope the AI Gods favour you and actually focus on the big hitters instead of the bombers coming at you.The in game event spam and pop-ups feels like your surfing the net in the 90s or early 2000s. In a middle of a big space war and need to retreat, well better hope a basically full screen pop-up doesnt come along and make you lose that fleet, single player its fine it pauses the game, multiplayer you don't have that option. Sure you can turn it off, but that turns off EVERYTHING no filtering is available.Got vassalised or have an overlord? Well you better fight your way out because their base acceptance will forever be in the negatives no matter how much they love you. Sure you can say what player would release another player if they were getting a portion of your income but it kind of breaks the game if your not allowed to break off from them when they now trust you completely again.Federations. Where to start, they seem great but honestly they just hurt you costing you 2 influence (more on that later) a month to have one along with the hit to your fleet capacity just hurts you. If you invite any NPCs into the federation they will eventually get control of the federation fleet. And you better hope your not at war because they waste it, they will either keep it in one of their systems not doing a thing, randomly follow one of your smaller fleets around or simply suicide it against a fleet costing you warscore. So the only 'viable' way is to only invite actual players and let the NPCs do their own thing.Influence. By far the most important resource you get in the game really. Anything worth doing in the game costs influence, suppressing factions, forming a federation, colonising planets, building and maintaining frontier outposts, hiring leaders, upgrading your plantary capitals, a few buildings and spaceport attachments need them, forming defensive pacts, editcs the list goes on. So much uses it but you get so little from actually playing the game. Early game its fine, you will usually sit at the low cap of 1000, but late game, well you might need to wait months to hire a leader. Or worse yet all those planets you just acquired leech your influence so much to suppress you now have 0. So no more admirals or scientists.The UI is very lacking, you want to build ships in one of your sectors shipyards. Well you have a couple of choices but the easiest I found is press M (to go to the big map), find the world, click on the system to zoom into system view, click on the planet, click spaceport, build ships. So you need 5 steps just to get to build a ship. There desperately needs to be an option to have your sectors spread the building across all their planets. Especially when you consider late game your sectors may have hundreds of planets in them, your core worlds will range from 5-20 so those extra spaceports are very useful to build a fleet fast in a large battle. Its the same for your core worlds really, lets say you have 5 planets, you have to click on the planet name, spaceport, build, go to next planet and repeat over and over to get ships out fast making it remarkably tedious to build ships. If it had 'Core worlds spaceport' and spread the load it would make it alot less micro and click intensive.Finally the ships, you have Corvettes, Destroyers, Cruisers and Battleships. They are customisable but not alot, 1-3 sections. No massive Titans or Dreadnoughts or even capital ships (unless you use mods). For a massive space 4x game having only 4 buildable spaceship types is rather dismal. Mind you there are other ships in the game, Fallen/Awakened Empires, Extrademensional visitors, the scourge all have unique and powerful ships, even the pirates have unique ships.There are many other things I have issues with in this game. And writing this review I honestly asked myself numerous times why I even play the game. The list of things I like are so much smaller than the list of things I want to see fixed. Though I still play, and the reason why I think is though the game is flawed, might even go as far as to say it should be classed as a beta release still, its an entertaining game to play with friends. It could be deeper, it definately needs polish, and mods really do fix alot of that (automated explore mod is one that should be in the game from the start not a research a space faring race doesnt know how to let a scientist, you know those smart people that have more than 2 braincells, explore how they see fit).I do recommend the game, I even bought the DLC for it, well one of them the others are in my eyes a joke for their price. Soundtrack (should be free in my eyes) a novel (should be around $1) and another race (which is just art, and what do you know a mod can do that too for free). I would recommend buying it and playing it, if your unsure about the game wait for it to drop in price and have a sale you shouldn't regret it.			"

YouTube™ Video: Stellaris Preview and Gameplay Basics (Steam/PC) 

			Views: 2,571		

			In this video, we show a preview of the game ‘Stellaris’ for Steam. Video was Recorded and Voiced by The Hidden Levels one and only Manic Ado.		

 Stellaris was developed by Paradox Development Studio and published by Paradox Interactive. Stellaris was released for Steam on Monday 9th May 2016. The price for this game is £34.99/$39.99. A press review copy was provided for The Hidden Levels. It was a groggy morning when I was on steam browsing around for upcoming games to see if any of them caught my attention. I suddenly stumbled across this title ‘Stellaris’ which instantly grabbed me by the font of the text upon a very abstract image. Upon closer inspection my cravings and demands for a space exploration game suddenly peaked as soon as my eyes browsed the pictures and videos behind Stellaris. I have never before been interested in tactical space games, this was all new to me. Just like the whole idea behind the game. Starting on a planet and then exploring space. The fear of the unknown, the fear of not knowing what is next. I was very scared because I am new to the whole Space Genre and 4X. Before I knew it, twenty hours had passed on this game. Here is what I liked and disliked about the game.  What I liked:   Guided hand  – The tutorial on this game comes in three options. Full, tips and none. I am so grateful for the fact that this tutorial really does help, without it I would’ve still been left swimming with the fishes. It’s completely voiced over by an AI robot (Your assistant) who is eager to help you with every menu click and move you make. Once you feel you know the ropes of the game you can happily turn him off in menu and he will disappear into the void. Shoot me to space  – The graphics of this game, the universe are indeed beautiful to look at. From the Sun in the centre of the solar system to the swirling dust clouds on the surface of each planet, I want to be instantly shot into space to the beautiful colors that surround me. Some systems which you explore have Black Holes, Yellow Dwarves and other vortexes which are really stunning to look at.  Lively Galaxy  – With a Galaxy size ranging from 100 stars to 1000 stars and with up to 39 AI Empires, the whole galaxy really feels alive and the game suddenly becomes life with the amount of interaction and size. I have yet to scratch the surface of a 1000 star scenario and I’ve been playing for around 15 hours on that one save. Customisation  – The customisation for each empire is crazy. From the character portraits to their traits, names, visions and planet names you can really have a heavily customised empire. You can also go and edit the preset empires to slightly change them too.  M and Ms  – The magic m’s are definitely on this game. Multiplayer is a really really good experience. It plays very similar to single player, the only difference is that only the host can pause and move the time. A really great super feature is that you can also save games online and then come back to them later. The other magic M is mod support, the game has extensive support for mods and they said “every aspect of the game is moddable”.    Where did my day go? – I swear it was only an hour. At least it felt that. Before you know it, your day has disappeared. The game has a special talent of taking away that time you have.   What I disliked:   Maybe just a week of playing  – The fact time flies when playing this game means you will need a lot of spare time. This game requires a lot of time investment and could easily cost you your job or family. Okay... maybe not that bad... but it still does suck your life away. Easy?  – There is no easy difficulty on the game. Just Normal and upwards. For newbies to the genre like me starting from normal is almost suicidal. Even with 20+ hours invested in the game I have not got to a point yet of seeing if I can actually take over the AI so I cannot comment so much on that but I believe they won’t be a push over. The several jousts me and the AI have had with the combat had ended in me losing mostly although it was not by much and pretty fair. Settings and sliders  – The settings in the game are pretty minimum and there are in fact no graphic settings. I would’ve loved to have options for low, medium, high and ultra but the game seems to have only one setting. The game still runs fine for me however but I believe people who have a lower specified computer will have more issues trying to play the game with no options of lowering quality for playability. Which brings me on to my next point. 1000 stars and max empires  – With the maximum stars and 36 empires all playing in one game, the game gets slightly jumpy. The game remains playable however and is still enjoyable. I won’t talk too much about my specifications or in detail but it’s an average PC. (2GB VRAM) and according to the steam stats page it’s better than half the peoples PC’s out there. I know it’s not the best and you can get much better but for the people who may not have that then the game falls into a grey area for running bigger scenarios.   Campaign or Story Mode  – I feel a story mode or scenarios which puts you into situations like being outnumbered or two massive Alliances with a back story fighting each other would’ve been really good. The game does have some story in the situation log however but I feel a more dedicated story mode would’ve been perfect for this game.I came into Stellaris as a novice and was very scared of being unable to handle it. I was delighted however to be able to easily grasp the basics and progress to a point where I did not want to sleep and continue playing all night long. I played a single player game and a multiplayer game in the time I spent playing Stellaris and even though I spent a chunk of time playing the game I did not progress too much into a point of conquering enemies. In fact I only went to war with one of the thirty seven nations and only made contact with 8 in the whole time of me playing the single player game. The game is real fun and addictive however, so much that I highly recommend it to all my friends, family and viewers. Paradox have really blown my mind with this game and how much I can get lost in the galaxy and far beyond. I would avoid this game however if you wanted to spare your life... but then again... go for it! It’s definitely worth experiencing and I highly recommend this game.			"

												I was excited after the first few false starts, but when the game clicked it suddenly felt really, really empty.  Midgame is unsatisfying micromanagement and the endgame is bare.  The technologies are not interesting and weaponry is a simple rock-paper-scissors type deal despite the scifi name.  Currently balancing is terrible, so there are lots of invincible strategies that break the spirit of the game.It lacks enough variety for 4X, and unlike their historical games there is no character.  Don't expect political intrigue within or between empires.  The sectors do nothing, similar to activating a governor in old Civ.  All of the aliens have similar behavior behind their flavor text, and the same dozen or so events happen all the time.  For example, in a typical game you will 'unexpectedly discover' a gigantic alien carcass about 20 times, and when you investigate the result is exactly the same.  It gets tedious very quickly.Either this is the skeleton of a future good game, or they got it out the door quickly because they lost vision.  Either way the experience is shallow at the moment.			"

												First thing first: the game works flawlessly on Linux.The graphics are beautiful, and the game runs smooth even on my laptop which has an Intel graphic card (using the open source Intel driver).Second, this is Paradox game with the best tutorial I've ever seen.It also helps that the UI design is way, way better than their other titles.Also last but not least, the gameplay. Oh man, it was ridiculously addictive, and deep! Playing for just 2 hours I ran into all kinds of anomalies while exploring the galaxy, making the task of sending a ship to explore unknown stars feel like an episode of Star Treks. From space whales to long lost civilizations. And we haven't even got to other factions yet.In short, think MoO2, but with all the goodies you expected from Paradox grand strategy game. Each government has its own unique mechanics, each ship is commanded by a captain that has attributes (a la CK2 lite), hell even your goverment is run by a politician who also has attributes and gained experiences, Each planet has pops that works factories or labs, and these pops would also influence how your government is run. Hell, This game is basically the culmination of Paradox grand strategy games, and a very refined one at that.I'd write more, but I need to get back to my empire. I feel like I barely scratch the surface of what this game has to offer. So, tl;dr is game is good, really, REALLY good. From the gameplay to graphics to sounds. Paradox really hit the homerun with this one			"

												Once upon a time, there was a handsome♥♥♥♥♥Canadian from Kamloops, BC that enjoyed the simple things in life - Cold beer, real maple syrup, bacon, poutine, and tax-funded healthcare. He didn't want after much, but one thing he did desire was a quality sci-fi grand strategy game that was highly customizable, with various 'endgame' challenges and an excellent random faction generator. He searched high and low, or at least he waited patiently and hoped, and one day his patience was rewarded by none other than Paradox. And from that day on, he Grand Strategied happily ever after.Yes, friends, Stellaris is that fabled game. It is a wonderful introduction not only to sci-fi space strategy, but to the real-time grand strategy genre as a whole. Taking cues from past Paradox titles, as well as successful turn-based 4X titles such as the Galactic Civilizations series, Stellaris delivers an experience that frankly, has been sorely lacking. As a huge fan of other Paradox titles, as well as anything to do with SPEHSS, this game grabbed my eye easily and then pulled it out of the socket and proceed to make sweet hanky-panky with my skull.Where to start... Stellaris is easily one of the most accessible, least intimidating grand strategies out there. It has enough complexity that you still need to pay attention to what you're doing and who's around you, but especially for people that have never played a GS game or have only lightly dabbled in the genre, you'll likely really enjoy this one. Veterans and hardcore fans of Grand Strategy might find Stellaris a little to simple and easy mind you, so keep in mind that YMMV.-MODS-One of the things that I love most about Stellaris though is how easily and extensively it can be modified however. Want to add a Star Destroyer, the Pillar of Autumn, or a Mars Class Battlecruiser as a ship model? Custom ship themes will allow you to do this. If it can be made into a 3D model, imported into a theme, and then packaged and put up on the workshop, then you can have it in your game! The same goes for everything from your empire's symbols, flag backgrounds, race portraits, names, etc...-GENERAL GAMEPLAY-Gameplay in Stellaris plays a lot like Victoria, Hearts of Iron, CK, EU, etc... in that you're given the world map (In this case, a galaxy populated by anywhere from dozens to hundreds or thousands of stars) and left to conquer it through a variety of means. This could be done by peaceful acquisition of occupied planets and settling of unoccupied ones, it could be through the flexing of military might, or through shrewd diplomacy, by getting other races to fight eachother so you can swoop in and ""clean up"" the leftover mess. Standard fare. But be cautious, because there are some crazy powerful ""Fallen Empires"" that you can include in your game, and frankly they're massive♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Never trust them. Ever.Politically, you may have to deal with everything from elections to usurpers to racial, independence, or economic driven riots and rebellions. The political system, while not terribly deep, does make the game more interesting and the fact that some of the people of your worlds may develop new traits that put them at odds with the rest of your empire will keep you paying attention to where you draw future colonists from and where you station your fleets. Some of your more distant worlds may require a peaceful ""persuasion force"" of battleships in low orbit to keep the population from getting any smart ideas.Star systems are handled in two ways: Cores and sectors. Core systems are few, and allow the player to have direct control. Typically, these solar systems will be either in the heart of your empire, or they'll be on a particularly dangerous border where you need to be able to control military defense infrastructure directly. Sectors are basically automatically governed, but you can set some rules and limits to how that's done. One of the good things with sectors is that a governor applied to a sector will apply their bonuses to every world in it. So if you have a sector with a ton of industry, and a governor with a bunch of industrial production bonuses, then you've got yourself a recipe for fleet spam!-COMBAT-Battles are handled in real time. There are some formation orders that you can issue to your fleets, but battles are pretty much hands-off affairs of ""Point your fleet at their fleet, fly at eachother, and shoot ALL THE LASERS"". Basically, the *FREEM*ing will start and won't stop until one side is dead or runs off. It leaves something to be desired, but with how big and crazy battles can get, I see why they did it.-COLONIZATION-Colonizing worlds is really similar to the Galactic Civ series - once your scientists scan a habitable planet, you have colony ships loaded with colonists who carry the traits and ideals present on their world (multiple different groups of ideals and/or species on one planet will give you a choice of which group to recruit from if applicable), and you tell said colony ship to colonize a world. It will do so, upon which you pick the tile to make landfall on, clear away any hazard tiles, and then have a finite number of tiles available to settle on in direct relation to the size of the planet or moon. Be aware that your race's homeworld ecosystem type will directly influence which planets you can settle on at first. If you play a race of anthropomorphic Polar Bears from an arctic world, then you can only settle on arctic, alpine, or tundra worlds to start. Anything warmer will be too inhospitable for you until you research the right tech to either settle them or, better yet, terraform them. The same goes for other climates.-UPGRADES- Upgrading and designing new ships was done with ease-of-play in mind. This is great for the player that wants to just come up with new configurations and play the game itself, but for players more partial to Galactic Civ's method of build the whole ship piece by tiny piece, it won't satisfy. However, for the former it is extremely satisfying. You pick your ship class, you pick the hull design or hull segments you want (IE Front A/B/C, Midsection A/B/C, Engines A/B/C) and then populate it with weapons and modules that correspond to the available size or type slots on the hull pieces (S/M/L/X/T/P/H). When  updated versions of the weapons or modules become available, you simply open that ship, replace them in the design, and overwrite it. All ships of that design will auto-update over time and for a fee. No deleting mountains of obsolete designs like in GalCiv, Paradox knows how to make things simple!-RANDOM EVENTS-In terms of random events, I don't want to spoil anything but rest assured - there are a ton of them and they're all over the place. From planet-based events, to entities and units in star systems, anomalies, multi-stage investigation missions, election promises, and more!-THE GUD STUFF-Honestly, and we all know Canadians can't lie worth a damn anyway, Stellaris is one of the best games to come out of 2016 in my opinion. It takes elements of what make Grand Strategies so great, combines them with elements of what makes Sci-fi 4X so great, and then gives a simplified version of both styles of game that still has enough challenge, depth, and complexity to keep the average person entertained. And while some criticize Paradox for their habit of supporting games for years after release with mountains of tiny, cheaply priced DLCs and a few big expansions, I for one love this model. It will keep the game fresh in exactly the way I want it to be, without having to pay for the stuff I don't want.TL;DR, Stellaris is something of an underrated diamond in the rough. Paradox created a real gem here, and if you love strategy games (and moddable ones at that), then you absolutely don't want to miss out on Stellaris, which deserves a solid 8.5/10 in my books.			"

												This will be a terrific game in about twenty more patches and with a good $200 worth of DLC modules added, because that's how Paradox rolls now.  After all, it worked for Crusader Kings 2.  That's not sarcasm, by the way.Seriously, it did work for CK2.  That's an awesome game and I've sunk far more time & money into it than I'd care to admit.  All that extra stuff has left me spoiled - I admit it - and nothing else than having that level of depth & complexity does it for me anymore.  Which I'm sure is exactly the way Paradox wanted it.  Their DLC model is perfectly addictive and it works.  The simple stuff is cheap, the deeper stuff costs a bit more, and you're never having your arm twisted to buy more than you want.  But I also know that if I ever booted it up today with all those mods and all that DLC turned off I'd fall asleep on my own keyboard in fifteen minutes.  Like with any other addiction, you build up a tolerance.  You need that bigger dose to get anything out of it.  Which is fine once you've already got all that stuff.Stellaris, on the other hand, doesn't have all that other stuff yet.  Don't believe me?  Think about their espionage system.  Oh, that's right, there isn't any.  Kind of odd that would be completely missing in a modern x4 game, isn't it?  Can you think of any other games in the x4 genre to come out in the last decade that doesn't have spies in any form?  Yet here we are, completely lacking one, and why do you think that is?  Because it's going to be added latter.  Along side everything else that is so obviously missing.  After all, you can only pretend to be exicted about discovering the exact same four alien species (gas grazers, crystals, etc) so many times.  Anomalies may be interesting the first time you see them, but come back in a month and see if you actually stop to read any of those info-blurbs.  You won't, because you've read them all fifty times already & now it's dull.  In fact, once that initial ""new game"" buzz wears off everything is going to feel dull real quick.Which is exactly what they want, because that's when the DLC train is going to start rolling in with twenty boxcars behind it.  Slowly but surely, dollar by dollar, Stellaris will indeed evolve into one of the greatest x4 space opera games ever made.  It may end up taking five years and costing you two hundred bucks, but as someone who's already been there with CK2, I can assure you that somehow it will feel worth it.  Seriously, it will.  And I have no problem with that.  It's a good system - it works.  I applaud their marketing technique.  It is brilliant.All I am saying is that right now is not the time to jump onto the Stellaris bandwagon.  Give it a little while and the patches will roll in, the price will come down, and the first DLCs will come out to start filling all the glaring empty spaces in the current game design.In short, come back in a year and I'm certain this review will be a very happy thumbs up.  But until then it's probably best to not pick up the habit until there's actually more out there to feed the addiction, otherwise you'll be left wanting.			"

												Stellaris is your typical Paradox grand strategy game which is set in space. The early-game is fantastic and it gives me great pleasure to explore the universe and its anomalies, making first contact and react to events. Once I reach mid-game, the game grinds to a painful halt. Many of the features and functions of this game are undeveloped and sometimes not very well thought through, but, knowing Paradox, this is something they will work on with future DLCs. All in all, this is a good game with greater potential waiting to be unlocked.

												(Excerpt of my review here: http://www.tweak.dk/review/Stellaris/2660/1/1)""With only a ”mere” 20 or so hours with the game, I have barely begun to scratch the surface in Stellaris. If I know Paradox (and I think I do) there are many, many more hours of entertainment to be had because of the dynamically generated gameplay, where every universe you create is unique.In my opinion, Stellaris brings a much needed breath of fresh air to an otherwise stagnated 4X strategy genre, where almost every game is in part inspired by either Civilization or the Master of Orion series. It’s done with a finish rarely seen outside of big budget, big studio productions – with a very small team. Stellaris has an excellent combination of freedom of design and deep political system that we don’t see nearly enough of in my opinion. The pace of the game is great for the most part, starting out with a complete hands on control of the empire early on, while slowly handing off more and more power to local governors that can administrate entire regions of systems for you, in exchange for more autonomy and a reduced tax rate. Your neighbors react in a very realistic manner to your world views – which can very easily lead to war. I can say from personal experience that being pro-slavery is not easy when you’re surrounded by pacifist hippies – who suddenly seem less interested in peace, and much more focused on plotting your inevitable demise and raising war fleets to accomplish that. I’ve really enjoyed my time with Stellaris, and I’m sure I’ll be having many more late nights of playing it over the coming years. I have minor gripes with how automation of ships work (or the lack thereof), where I definitely think it should have been an option. Information about mechanics and choices is also a little on the light side at times. With all of that in mind, I’ve come to a final score for Stellaris of 9 (and a half...appendage). It falls just shy of a full 10 at current, but knowing Paradox’s DLC model, they will easily make it there in time…and maybe more.""			"

												Stellaris is a game that I really want to like but ultimately it comes up short. What we have here is an interesting game engine without much substance. All the game features are too generic. I don't find myself caring about any other factions. There's nothing that immerses me in the universe. I'm just playing around with generic templates with no real end game (there are late game ""mega events"" to try and mix things up but they are also rather bland).Having played and loved EUIV I can sort of see how they might have ended making Stellaris like this. There are similarly generic mechanisms in EUIV but the trick is that the terrain (i.e. Earth) and the real world history behind each nation provides enough flavor and differentiates the otherwise generic cookie-cutter nations. In Stellaris, there's no terrain, just a big open space with stars scattered around, and the other races have nothing to make them stand out as memorable in any way.At best this feels like a proof of concept for a game engine that could be used to make a compelling game. Whether they knew that and are relying on modders and/or DLC or if they just didn't realize the shortcomings is unclear to me.			"

												Yes!Stellaris is one of those major 4X-Games that are still in development and bringing new content each patch with it.DLCs are expensive (10$-20$).Because of Development phase, Content is getting better, Mechanics are getting better.Might be hard to learn, so give it a try if you got money to spare.There is one major downside, the game does not support Multithreading yetTherefore, the late game is almost unplayable due to being very slow and lagging.We can just hope that one day,... one day... multithreading will be possibleThis is my one begging to the Paradox-Team.8,6/10Edit:I correct: The problem is that there is no ""Multithreading"". The Engine is not the main problem, as I mentioned in a previous version.			"

												I don't write reviews. But this one deserves one. I'm 51 years old player. I started playing games with Sinclair Spectrum 48K (apart from ATARI console of course). I have played every legendary games of PC gaming history while they were first released. I bought a better PC for Wing Commander for example. In my player life, I have never misjudged a game. So, read this accordingly.This game has the feel of what 'Master of Orion' had at its time! And it has more to offer. It has a great potential. Although this is a strategy game, it absorbs you and when you manage your science vessel, you feel like, you are there. When you manage politics, you start thinking like a politician. You should see the whole picture and act accordingly. Some times your trivial decisions can lead a disastrous end for a planetary ecosystem which doesn't effect your people, but they managed to make feel you sorry for it. I advise to buy it. You wont regret. If you don't like it after first attempt, wait a little bit and try again, because devs are constantly at work and the game evolves. I won't give you a ist of pros and cons list. There are enough of them here. All I can say is that you will get your moneys worth, not less but most probably much more. And one day you will tell others, 'I played it before it became a legend!'.. ;)   "

http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=152166.msg7057493#msg7057493To quote a friend:It's like you met this girl on a dating site and you two seemed to hit it off really well. From her pictures she looked super fit and she seemed to carry herself off well. Not to mention you got to talk to her friends and they made you think she was great. When you decide to meet however, turns out she doesn't have money for the cab fare to get there so after some hesitation you decide to just pay for that.She arrives. She looks pretty but she's shallow and extremely materialistic. You get the feeling she's not all there. She's fun to be with at first, but soon you realize two things. One, she seems to be just repeating what people have said before. Two, she's actually only 14-years-old. You were just completely bedazzled initially by her looks to notice.So after an awkward first conta- meeting, you finally drop her back off at her place. You're feeling a bit regretful at the whole affair and kinda want your cab fare back (along with the other expenses she managed to accrue along the way). The door opens and 'lo and behold. Her dad is there. It's mother♥♥♥♥ing Crusader Kings II. He's shirtless, abs glistening with sweat like he just finished another exhilarating workout. Hair parted in that perfect way that accentuates his perfect face. his eyes brimming with the spark and wisdom of age. He smiles a bit at you, knowingly with a dash of smugness that comes across as just beautiful in every way. There are a few scars on his chest which mark the signs of his intense battle to get to where he is. His hand decorated with the blood of the heathen. His magnificent DEUS VULT under the towel that he greets you in, huge in size and bursting with... DLC.You take another look at Stellaris. She eyes you coquettishly, though you can't help but remind yourself how young she is, especially when compared to her father.You realize what she might be when she becomes an adult, her pedigree might take her far.But for now, you toss Stellaris into the bushes and jump into the arms of Crusader Kings II.

												Stellaris is an entry level real time strategy game with a space setting.This is a difficult game to review. On the one hand, it is a very addictive blend of 4X and real time strategy, on the other, it is a game lacking a lot of depth.Paradox's other games like Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis, Victoria, and Hearts of Iron have far more depth than Stellaris does and all have their own niche. A lot of the depth comes from the historical setting in these games that attempts to accurately portray the world's situation at game start, and each game's own take. CK is all about dynasties and plots; EU is a huge game of Risk with actual countries, Vicky can be won through playing the economy, and HoI is obviously all about real time warfar.But Stellaris? There are no real countries, there are no recognisable situations, and the game isn't sure if it is about diplomacy or warfare in space. Both are very lacking. Diplomacy is almost non-existent and warfare all too often comes down to just spamming immense amounts of ships until you either win or lose.Even though the recent major patch, Heinlein, introduced much better ship mechanics, all too often it is still just a numbers game.Does that make Stellaris a bad game? No, absolutely not. If you go in expecting an easier RTS where all players are inherently equal since there are no pre-defined bonuses (other than allowing some AI races to start with a minor advantage), you can have a lot of fun with this game. Each game will be very different since everything in the galaxy will be generated in another way, so where in one game you may find yourself boxed in by stronger empires and lose everything, in another you may be able to control a huge part of the galaxy and eventually conquer it all (until the end game crisis comes).What elevates Stellaris above just a basic real time strategy game is its events. As you explore the star systems you can encounter many small stories, most of which can turn out different in several ways. One time you find a seemingly abandoned starship and have your scientist explore it, only to lose your entire ship. The next time the same event comes up you get a rare technology instead, etc.More skilled leaders will usually lead to better results, but everything remains somewhat random.So, do I recommend Stellaris? Yes, but only for people who already like Paradox games or similar games like Civilization series (bearing in mind Stellaris is real time strategy, not turn based). If you want the next Master of Orion or X, don't go looking here.			"

												This game is so good. It really gives you a feeling of running an interstellar empire with gameplay that includes managing the ethos and expectations of your subjects, administrative sectors and more. There is always something interesting to do, with random events, planet development, empire management and ongoing politics.The game is incredibly well presented. Everything is gorgeous and the music is fantastic. The user interface is a dream to use with mouse over information, right click menus, queuing up orders, and various screens.There is strategy in your fleet design and choosing the right technologies to gain an edge over your opponents is important. Then you watch the battle play out. It looks fantastic.The technology system is fantastic with random choices each time you finish a tech. There is a lot of depth to the technology system and hard choices to make sometimes on what to research.The ability to customise your race and empire in this game is the best I've ever seen. Stellaris is a game where you can really create any kind of space faring empire that you can imagine, from the noble houses and Emperor of Dune to the space faring states of other sci fi settings.

In short: A refreshing new title to the genre of 4X, Stellaris introduces new concepts and is fun for a while. However, because of its very slow pacing & progression it doesn't have the fun factor and staying power of better titles in the genre.It's a good game at its core. But some design decisions ruin it for me. It will be frustrating if you are a gamer who cares about fun/time ratio, or just want to feel like you made progress in a play session. You will feel like it's a game you'd love to love, but you never manage to truly get into it because of its slowness and that feeling of ""playing chained"" it gives you.THE GOOD- A real attempt at innovation. Mechanics like immigration (population can move freely between planets and empires if enabled), robotic & synth ""build-able"" population, randomly generated races (including how they look), anomalies you discover in exploration, enlightenment (think of it as making city-states out of barbarians in civ), uplifting (genetically engineering pre-sentient species to make custom population types with traits you want), etc are new and a truly fresh and welcome additions to the genre. On this aspect alone the game should be applauded.- Great graphics & aesthetics. Love how planets, stars, and black holes look.- A huge time sink. Which is good for a lot of people but not for everyone since it mostly comes from a diluted experience. But if you are the kind of player who likes to stick with a single game for a long time then this is a good investment for you.- Big on exploration. It puts EXPLORATION back into 4X. Finding anomalies, new alien races, derelict ships, ancient artifacts and stories of ancient races, etc. Many varied events spice up the discovery of the universe. THE BAD- EXTREMELY slow. I am 75 hours in my first game and I haven't won yet. I will probably need twice that to win a single game. Everything takes forever and is not necessarily fun because too often you feel like the game is doing its best to slow your progress, thus a very strong feeling of ""playing chained"". Keep in mind, I AM PLAYING ON MAX SPEED! And only pause to issue orders when necessary.- Too micromanagement intensive. It is strange to see so much micro in a game that has the universe as a playground. It feels like a missed opportunity to focus on macro mechanics.- Tedious and repetitive on some tasks, like controlling survey ships system by system and no ""automate workers"" option like in similar titles. Note: Yes you can shift click to chain commands, but you lose the queue each time you find something like an anomaly so that's not practical. You will also eventually find a technology to automate survey ships, but that's gonna be way down the road and an expensive tech at that when you have better options.- Some extremely unfortunate design decisions. One example is that building takes always the same amount of time, with no option to accelerate or speed up the process no matter your level of power of technology. A planet that has 20 population and every upgrade will build a new power plant in the same exact speed as that other new colony you just built and that has 1 single population. If that wasn't bad enough, if you have Mining network level 3, you can't just build that right off... you have to build the 1, then upgrade to 2, then upgrade to 3... each of them taking months of fixed time that can never be made faster, not even through buying the damn building with credits like similar games. This means that the game starts slow and stays slow, no matter how powerful you get. This is quite bad because--in most games in this genre--we accept the slowness of careful building at the start with pleasure and anticipation knowing that playing it carefully well will lead to a spike in power later as things build up into a snowball effect. In Stellaris, you never quite hit that ""now watch me soar"" phase. It's just a full game seemingly stuck in ""slow settling"" phase.- Tedious victory conditions and only 3 of them: (1) Own 40% of HABITABLE planets. Not just habited, but all habitable planets! ... and the universe is quite huge (2) Subjugate all other empires (that's a lot too because war is extremely slow, I'll explain why in the next point) (3) Have your federation (allies) control 60% of HABITABLE PLANETS, meaning even if you ally and conquer absolutely everyone, there's dozens or hundreds of planets for you to colonize still. Colonization being capped by Influence, which generates very slowly and is capped at 1000 storage, meaning you can't even stockpile it for the right time. Tedious! And there are no creative victory conditions like the science or cultural victories in civilization, just tedious conquest of the whole space one planet at a time. Even players who absolutely love this game will confess they rarely finish a game because it's so tedious to clean up for a victory.- Warfare is usually where you get to blow off some steam and get some blood flowing in this type of games. But nope, not here. Warfare is as tedious and as plagued by slowness as everything else. First, travel is very slow and traveling back and forth takes FOREVER because your warp engines heat up and need to cool down at every jump, and they need also to build energy for a jump. Second, you can't outright capture planets... even if you invade them the enemy will take them back automatically at the end of the war. The only way to capture planets is to say you want them UPON WAR DECLARATION, and there is a point system that limits how many you can demand. You can't demand more than 4 or 5 planets each war (costs 17-25 points per planet and your maximum points are 100), which makes it problematic and a chore to take down the bigger empires. And you can't outright vassalize bigger empires because the score to vassalize is too big (over 100), you have to make them smaller first and that goes through slow conquest a handful of planets at a time. So you wage war, take a few planets, have to wait 10 years to be able to declare war again, rinse and repeat, and this for EVERY empire in the game. Tedious! Not to forget that even after you do this, you still have to colonize habitable planets that nobody took. Shoot me in the head please.- Little sense of accomplishment at every play session. This is what absolutely kills it for me. Ok so you took a day off, you played Stellaris all day... and then you go to bed... feeling you did absolutely nothing. You wake up in the weekend, and do another full day of play thinking ""ok yesterday was slow but today I WILL make progress""... nope. Not happening. None of the 4X titles--or strategy games in general--make me feel like this and it's not a good feeling. BUY OR NOT?Stellaris is a gem. But a very flawed gem at the moment. Most of its issues come from a single source: The feeling that the designers were singing ""make it slow! make it slow!"" (in my mind in the rhythm of ""let it go"" from frozen) while making it.The good news is that this is a Paradox game and it is still being worked on. Will they fix it? Do they even consider this slowness a problem? I have no idea. But in the meantime, the slowness is the biggest factor deciding if you will enjoy the game or not.If sinking hundreds of hours in a single campaign is not a problem for you, you will probably like this game. It has enough innovation and eye candy to be likable. But if you actually want a game that has a pulse and decent pacing and energy, this game will frustrate you and you will move on to other titles relatively quickly.I would still get it on a big sale just to see the innovations it brings. But I definitely don't see this game as having the staying power of better titles like civilizations and endless space in its current state. It is mostly something you would buy if you already played and are tired of better games like civ and endless space.			"

												EDIT: I am planning on playing the Utopia Expansion and will update this review accordingly.Stellaris starts off strong. I can guarantee the first thirty minutes to an hour of a new player’s experience will be in the species creation screen. Your mind will fill with the possibilities of a cuddly, fast breeding race of dog people, who also happen fanatic militarists firing off volleys of nuclear missiles at everything they see, or a bunch of spiritual hippie xenophile humanoids who want nothing but Galactic Peace. There is an endless amount of ways to customize your race to what you like, and you can even add traits which can give bonuses to your people, albeit balanced out with negative traits if necessary. At this point I was fully invested in the game, and was very excited to explore and settle the vast, empty expanse of space.As the game begins, the galaxy is wide, empty and dark, and the mind races with the possibilities of what could be out there, and what might be lurking in the ether. The soundtrack is beautiful, and something I still listen to daily, day dreaming of humanity’s destiny among the stars. You send out your science ship into the void,  and survey systems for habitable worlds, resources, anomalies, and aliens. Some aliens may be hostile, some might be intelligent, and some might even be primitive, varying from stone age to early space age. This early game section is honestly the very best part of Stellaris. Research technologies, terraform new worlds, discover anomalies, design ships, exploit the galaxy’s resources, and meet your neighbors. The very first couple of empires you meet are exciting, they can be a race of collectivist spiders who HATE your guts and fire lasers on your ships if you stray into their territory, or entrepreneurial jellyfish who want nothing more than to make money and trade, the possibilities really are endless. The primitive races are great to play with, ranging from passively observing to going full on XCOM and enslaving them into your workforce. Good relations with other empires will also open up to possibility of open migration, leading to polyglot populations of settled planets, like humanoids living alongside giant geckos.With the dormant ancient mining drones or hostile space borne aliens means that at one point you will have to fight, even if you are playing as peace loving hippies. There is a ship design  mechanic which may initially appear complex, but it’s a simple matter of maxing firepower and fulfilling energy requirements. It’s not hard after researching the right technologies to make the best ship, and this contributes to the ship’s “power” which is designated by the number. You would think that there is more to this system, such as different fleet doctrines, formations, etc. Unfortunately, there isn’t. If your fleet’s power number is 10, and the enemy’s power number is 8, guess what, you win. That’s the extent of complexity. Even when you are fighting gargantuan wars with hundreds of ships on both sides, is your number bigger? If so, you win. There is a tiny bit of strategy with missiles, mass driver guns, and lasers as well as point defense and fighters, but from what I’ve seen whoever brings the bigger number wins. As you expand, the previously mysterious galaxy becomes filled with giant blobs of color. Borders become drawn, and if you’ve done a halfway decent job of expanding you will find that you are one of many large-ish empires sprinkled throughout the galaxy. Remember how unique and interesting that first other empire was when you met them? It gets real old when a new one gets revealed every few minutes. As unique and pretty as the species art is, and as varied as their randomly generated ethos/government type/ traits are, it all starts to…. blend together. You know how procedural generation can lead to blandness since everything feels the same? Stellaris has this problem with its empire generation. I honestly stopped trying to keep track of which species was which after the sixth or so, it was just a mess of xenophobic mushrooms, materialistic snapping turtles, pacifistic slugs, and what was once exciting becomes bland. This is also about the time when the game’s sector system comes into play. The sector system is mandatory but doesn’t add any meaningful gameplay. I understand why they added it, but forcing a player to basically start ignoring large swatches of territory isn’t fun. Now that my sector is automated, it can sit around and do nothing, despite me giving it an “energy focus.” The sector AI is a big issue for many players and has yet to be fixed completely.At this point, there aren’t meaningful things left to do. Yes you are still constructing stuff on your colonized planets, yes you are still researching technologies that let you upgrade your spaceport/ colonize more planets/ build more powerful ships, but the game becomes mind numbingly dull and uninteresting. The once dark and mysterious galaxy is just another patch of space being held by Krillian Combine or something, and there is honestly nothing left to do. You can go to war with other empires in order to grab more territory, but since the space combat is just a matter of “who has the bigger number”, it just ends up feeling like busy work rather than being any kind of interesting tactical experience. Oh no, your military stack is 12k? Looks like I’ll bring 15k just in case. That’s it, no nuance or thinking involved at all. Don’t like war? You also have the option to unite everything with a Federation but the game’s diplomacy system is bare bones, not to mention how it often doesn't make sense. I was spending all this time sucking this empire’s♥♥♥♥♥♥to get them to join a federation with me, but despite having a +200 opinion, with more than two hundred years of peace and nearly that long with open borders, migration, technology sharing, they STILL didn’t want to make a federation with me. I eventually joined a federation with somebody else, but this doesn’t answer the question. What do you do now?And honestly I feel as if Paradox doesn’t know either. You know how in Crusader Kings 2, events were always happening, and you always had to keep an eye out for opportunities to snatch territory away from your rivals? In that game, you had many options other than military conquest, but in Stellaris that’s all there is. Either make a giant fleet and attack people with boring combat, or join a federation and sit around, waiting to win. The early game starts of so good that by mid game I couldn’t believe that I didn’t know what to do anymore. The galaxy was no longer interesting and mysterious, but populated by a collection of randomly generated empires that all seem the same. I couldn’t think of a reason to continue playing because I didn’t see the point in dragging out the game’s uninteresting combat or its bland diplomatic options. I just stopped feeling the excitement of exploring the unknown cosmos and charting my species destiny. I just stopped feeling anything at all, other than boredom tinged with a hint of sadness.Stellaris will probably go the way of other Paradox titles, adding in DLC until a big pile of ten or so expansion packs costing around $200 makes this game the deep, compelling experience that it can be. However, as of right now, I can’t recommend the game. Everyone is talking about how great the 1.5 patch and the Utopia expansion will be, but I’m going to wait and see if the game gets better. Your best bet at this point is to wait a couple of years until you can pick up the base game plus essential expansions for cheap, since until the point the Stellaris is “complete”, why pay more for an inferior product?This game is big disappointment for me, but I am planning to revisit it in the future if and when Paradox releases enough content to make it a more fulfilling experience.

												Stellaris launched as a skeleton for DLC and, as a result, has very little in the way of meaty content. The game is an ostensible fusion of Grand Strategy and 4X, featuring massive scale, intragovernmental management, POPs, strategic resources, government types, etc. While it has the makings of the 4Xs and a smattering of strategy, it fails in both regards. I cannot recommend it in its present state.The game utterly lacks any deep systems outside of population management; there is no intergalactic economy to speak of, no trade routes, no logistical considerations for war (no fuel or ammunition), very limited options when declaring war (you can only conquer/liberate/vassalize planets/systems/empires, respectively; you cannot enforce government types, abduct citizens, execute leaders, or claim unsettled systems), very little in the way of planetary management (the sector system ensures that you'll rarely hold any more than 10 planets in a given game, whereas the galaxy can contain several hundred; on top of that, it's basically a similar version of GalCiv2's planet management screen with clunkier automation - you develop tiles and place people on them, that's it), very little control over research, and no espionage. You do a lot of clicking to affect little direct change.The leader system, where you can recruit extraordinary citizens from available populations in your empire, boils down to nothing more than a bunch of timed, growable modifiers. Leaders have no personality whatsoever. They do not trigger trait-specific events, and they have no effect on interactions with other empires unless they have traits that do. There are no feuds between two God-Emperors, no presidents detested by embittered rival empires, no events dealing with leaders of other empires, or anything of the sort. Contrast with CK2, where the characters of your leaders vastly affects the composition of your realm, even in vanilla.What depth there is remains inconsequential in most playthroughs. It's not like CK2, where you have to learn the ins-and-outs of managing vassals to have a shot at governing a large empire. I completely neglected my POPs beyond throwing down a few happiness buildings and paying off factions, and yet I've still yet to have one rebellion break out across multiple games, even when I've integrated fairly large, unhappy populations. I haven't even bothered with gene modifiation since I'm doing just fine without that kind of expensive, time-consuming optimization.Everywhere you look, it feels like something is missing. Interactions with other empires boils down to conquering them or allying with them and conqering them later. POPs management consists of spamming certain resources when factions get unruly and colonizing certain planets with certain species. War is a rock/paper/scissors spam-off where corvettes dominate the meta. Dealing with primitives involves picking one of four options and waiting, or just invading them like you would an AI - except it's even easier. Research consists of crossing your fingers and waiting for the game to generate the techs you want. Managing planets stays the same all throughout the game since anything beyond your first few get relegated to self-governing, inefficient sectors. There's just nothing worth engaging with, mechanically. Even exploration, the best-executed feature in the game, becomes worthless once you're either boxed in or you've already gathered data on other systems via map exchanges in a buggy, antiquated trading interface.Buy something like Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion instead. At least that game has compelling combat.			"

												Currently the game is rather threadbare, without nothing to do after your empire establishes itself, other than warfare, which if you are playing space nazies is ok, if you are playing a balanced to peaceful empire boredom sets in real quick. If Stellaris was as feature rich as EU/CK then it would be an amazing game, but it really does one thing, warfare, and it does that rather poorly.Quite why Paradox released such a shallow game I have no idea.

												Finally a grand strategy game that won't require you to watch any ""Let's play"" YouTube videos in order to understand the basic game features.  It's a really deep game but without the overwhelming complexity that plagued Paradox's previous games like Victoria II and Hearts of Iron III. You can't find a single slider in this game which is a huge relief atleast to me. Stellaris got one of the best tutorials I have seen: there is no tutorial mission  or a 300 page manual. Instead you simple enable in game tutorial at the start of the game and It gives all the information you need. Still leaving you to figure out how to master the game.Space combat is rather simple: when fleets engage you lose control and AI take command over your ships. You can relax and watch the entertaining fighting without worrying about the most efficient playing style. Land combat on planets work out the same way, except there is no eye candy available. You can just see army icons taking damage until other party is completely wiped out. While all this might not heard to be any entertaining, believe me it is. When all your careful planning, diplomacy and armament finally pays off, it's a feel like no other.There are incredible amount of game mechanics in Stellaris, but they are far easier to learn than they are in other Paradox games. Mechanics also works perfectly, are well described and introduced with a good pace during the game. I for example came across with genetic modifications when I had played Stellaris for 65 hours total. Develop team has put great effort towards customization. You can choose and name your race, leaders, ship designs, fleets, planets, etc. This gives great opportunity for roleplaying and play as you please.You only directly control 5 - 10 planets and rest is government by sector AI. This is a great feature that reduces late game  micro management that plagues pretty much every single strategy game in some level. Only problem I find with secors is that  you still control every single spaceport (compound where you product spaceships) and there is no one-click button to  sector spaceport. This is needless micro management and could be solved by simple adding every spaceport to the outliner list. Almost everything else in this game like exploration via science ships are done by easy one-click orders.Stellaris got two bigger problems at the moment. First is a lack of midgame features. After you have explored the galaxy and colonized every planet, there might be nothing to do for a while, especially if you play with a pacifistic civilization (wars of aggression not allowed). This partially fixed with Leviathans dlc which adds midgame features. Still there is a chance that you won't encounter any of the Leviathan's guardians in your game. Second problem comes with a lack of victory conditions. Currently you can only win by war. Own 40%(60% with federation) off all colonizable planets or to conquer all other empires. I admit it's no easy task to find a victory condition besides current ones that would still keep the game challenging.In my mind now is exactly the right time to get this game, because at its current state you will learn the game during your first game. Paradox just announced their first major expansion to Stellaris called ""Utopia"" which without a doubt makes the game harder to approach for new gamers, since it add many new features to the base game. Stellaris is all about the journey, not the destination.10 - Perfect game9 - Excelent game, best of the genre8 - Good game, worth your time7 - Average game, nothing really special6 - Bad game, avoid5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time4 - Failed game, unpayable			"

												I've had a blast playing this since it came out earlier in the year (2016). Early game exploration is really fun and the scale of the galaxy is great. I love the randomness and coming across lots of unique empires. I also enjoy the role-playing potential in the game. It is not a game without flaws but it is only going to get better and the first two patches have already improved the game a great deal.The music in the game is composed by the brilliant Andreas Waldetoft (he has also produced excellent music for other Paradox games such as CKII, EUIV and Victoria II). Visually, the game is lovely and it is enjoyable to look around the different systems and zoom in to look at your fleets and planets etc.I believe that this game is best enjoyed with a keen imagination. You design your own race and then see what stories the game throws at you. Although there is a lot of strategy elements involved, I feel that min-maxing or having an optimal style of play will not get the best out of the game. This game is best when you design an interesting new species with a fun play style and not when you pick all of the best traits to try to win the game. The early game is up there with some of the very best 4X strategy games. Exploring neighbouring star systems and coming across different anomalies/events/aliens is the most exciting part of the game. The mid-game is enjoyable as you weigh-up your position in the galaxy and tackle the various challenges you face. The main weakness of the game is the late-game but this is a common theme in these types of strategy games.I believe that this could well be the best 4X space strategy game in the future. I have confidence that the current project lead (Wiz, as he is known in the Paradox community) has the passion and the creativity to take this game to the next level. The game has incredible promise but, in its current state, it already provides an extremely enjoyable experience.			"

												This game starts off awesome and then drags really bad after about 15 hours. I am having trouble getting motivated to even start playing my save again it has gotten so boring, and the time it takes to restart just to see if it will all happen again will be just as boring.This game is missing a lot of content that should be in base game. Some form of trade, better AI, more events, diplomacy is a joke, etc.I dont hate the game, but if you want a full experience, it is not here. The start of the game is done, and that is it.It takes a long time to play because nothing happens unless you want to just go around and kill everybody, and combat is lackluster, so that will get stale quick too. You will easily spend tens of hours just moving science and construction ships around the map in a normal game waiting on something to happen.I personally wish i had not fell for the hype and waited.As long as the devs fix up the base game to be a complete experience without selling us the missing parts in DLC, i will probably change this review in future.

												Not recommending this at this stage. The game starts out nice, but by midgame turns into a rather pointless grind -- even when you know you will win in the end, you will have to drag through while clicking away RNG events that arent relevant anymore to your empire size. AIs are acting careless and by mid game, once you have bigger fleets the game slows down tremendously: so there is already little of relevance to do, and things get slowed in addition.DLCs might fill the missing pieces as usual for Paradox. I played through one default game, but likely wont touch this again for at least half a year. IF I would start a game again as-is, I likely would select a smaller galaxy, forcing earlier conflict and hopefully limiting some of the boring bean counter tasking.			"

												StellarisI really like this game. It is a lot of fun. Stellaris is much more than the typical Space 4X game.I play on super slow most of the time, which is why I have a lot of hours but have yet to finish a game. My first game went wrong, I was in a nebula so my fleets moved slower, but worse I had no minerals. After 20 years of gameplay I had mineral income of 12 per month. I could have stuck with it as there was a very weak enemy Empire I coud take out, but I restarted.My second game is great! I have room to expand and even won two wars so far.Stellaris has neat technology system, where you get to choose from 3 different techs each time. SOmetimes techs are different to choose from, so you have to choose the best for you when you can.Diplomacy is ... WOW! You can trade, set rivals, have embassies. There are also alliances and federations.Also, the population management system is full-blown. I have a binch of conquered worlds where the pops have Fanatic Xenophobic ethos = thta means they hate aliens, meaning me. Err, these pops are hard to manage! FUN !!! I guess over time things will smooth out.Love the ships and the ship design system. Ships have slots to place Weapons, Defenses+Reactors and also Support. I like designing the ships from time to time, and refits are a snap to handle.Oh, part of playing is sending out Science ships and Construction ships. This means a little bit of micro-management. I like it, others don't.The early game is slowwwwww .... some players would get bored, but I love it.Graphics are nice and the soundtrack is wonderful.I really enjoy this game. It is now one of my favorites, I am certain Paradox will improve the game even more.

												I wish there was a middle ground option. I enjoy the game, and if you look at my history with Paradox games, i generally love them (800hours on Vic2 600 odd hours on CK2 and about 400 on EUIV)However, this game is SEVERLEY lacking depth. The diplomacy which is primarily the reason i play paradox games as opposed to Total War is almost non existant. There is no trading mechanic whatsoever. And it generally feels incomplete as a game, and you ultimately seem ot be doing the same thing over and over again. Yet, this is where i have the problem with saying i dont reccommend the game. It is fun for the first few hours, and i do want to continue to play it, but im now playing a bit at a time and being bored because it is the same thing over and over again... explore this star system, investigate this anomaly...its great while youre exploring and understnding everything, but then its just the same thing over and over again. And then you begin to see just how shallow this is as a game, it really does feel like Paradox are using this as a vechle to sell DLC, which normally i dont have a problem with their DLC policy, but this game does lack such depth it does lead me to think that they have stripped it of features in order to add them back in at a later date at a cost. So, yeah this game WILL be very good, and im very excited for the next 12 months of this games development, but perhaps if youre cash strapped, wait for a sale. Honestly. .. Its the same thing over and over again.			"

												This is easily the absolute worst game I have ever sunk so much time into. But I'm done, I give up. This game is domestic abuse. You're desperate to play what you want this game to be, and it will keep punching you in the face with bad design on every level.The first thing you'll see is the UI. Don't be fooled, it's terrible. While functional enough on first introduction, like everything else with this game spending time with it results in constantly having to struggle with utterly amateurish problems. Fleet control is non-existent, thanks to having access only to a 'split half' button, and splitting off a new fleet via a list...and clicking every single individual ship. There's no shift click, drag click, zero functionality whatsoever. One click, ship moves. And if you click too fast it bugs out, registers a click outside the box, declares you must be done and goes with whatever was moved. Oh, and after every click the list scrolls back up to the top. So if you want to split off the battleships at the bottom of the fleet list in your 300 ship fleet, you need to scroll down, click, scroll back down, click, scroll back down....this is the quality of life the Stellaris UI consistently delivers to you. It creates frustrating micromanagement tasks where even the slightest degree of sci-fi strategy game experience and savvy would have resulted in none.So you're playing the game, you got some planets. You probably lost some science ships and leaders to 'lolrandom' RNG event failures that are the antithesis of strategy and risk management (you can't manage risk when there's no feedback on risks, so design like this is poor in any game and, again, amateurish), but whatever. Now we're up against the 'core systems' limit. See, for some reason this game was intended to be a macro scale grand strategy game, so obviously they put in absolutely tons of micro-intensive planetary tiles all with individual population and buildings. Because that's good design. Macro game, add loads of micro features. Genius. So, seeing this problem of an ever increasing micromanagement burden on the player as they expand, the designers added a solution! A planetary planner, so you can simply lay out what you want the planet to eventually look like and it'll develop itself towards it!....that's a joke, the actual solution is to force you to give the planet over to a 'sector', which places it entirely under the control of the AI. See, having introduced all these population and building mechanics, the designed solution is to then *force you to watch the AI f*** it up on your behalf*. As a result, the entire game consists of nothing more than you personally administrating a handful of planets, the research, and your fleet, while any other planet in your empire operates as an almost entirely untouchable (remember, terrible UI) AI controlled resource feeder that you have to spend highly limited influence points to regain control of for any reason. THAT'S the solution. Introduce tons of micromanagement features into your macro game, then force you to not interact with it. Oh, and remember, since playing around with your space navy is one of the only things you've got to do, because diplomacy is a shallow + and - numbers affair you usually have little power to affect (or care about), you have to recall back to the terrible UI for actually controlling your space navy. Yay. Fun.Since the AI is consequently such a powerful focus in the game, what with it controlling even the majority of your own empire, it is, obviously, top notch.....yeah, no, that was another joke, it's terrible. The AI will, with it's own empires and with your sectors, often fail to develop planets at all. The result is, oh my look at that, intensive micromanagement as you try to properly set up a world so the sector AI won't screw up with it after you hand it over, and a staggering degree of incompetence by opposing empires, who will all invariably be Space North Korea thanks to their patiently expanded military fleet and facepalmingly weak economy.The Steam review section simply doesn't allow the word limit to go over the flaws in Stellaris. The problem is that they're not immediately apparent. My assertion that Stellaris is like domestic abuse was, putting aside the inevitable 'triggerings' I'll get posted to me, very carefully chosen. You're going to be drawn into the idea of this game, you're going to want to play it. And then there'll be problems. It'll be shallow. Poor design will get in the way. But you're still invested in the idea of Stellaris....we all are, we want a cool sci-fi macro strategy game that's less opaque and nicer on the eyes than Distant Worlds: Universe! You'll buy the DLC. One is an overpriced cosmetic. The other adds a few bits of content that should have been in release and don't do enough to add life to a sterile galaxy of RNG anolomies and mining stations. You eagerly await each patch. They're supporting the game! It's expanding, getting better! ....except it isn't. The core experience remains *exactly the same*. Shallow. Dull. Frequently demanding of cookie cutter approaches. Sectors have been a failing so prevalent and consistent since launch that they....declared them to be fine, forced everyone into a single thread for it, then ignored the thread entirely.It took 288.9 hours for the endless stack of Stellaris straws to turn the back of my camel into a thin paste, and admit that I was working far, far too hard to try and get something, anything of what I WANT Stellaris to be from the pitiless, cold hands of the reality of what Stellaris IS, and will always be given the current direction and attitude of the developers,  judging by the forums.Hell, people can look at my review history and conclude I just ♥♥♥♥♥ about big games everyone loves, but I'll tell you this; I'd flip every single damned thing to recommended in comparison to Stellaris. Yes/No is a binary state. In a more granular world I'd have put Fallout between 50 and 60. Stellaris I'd give a 40, and that's a rating that can be achieved by anything that runs stable. Big whoop, well done. That's my Stellaris recommendation: ""It didn't crash."" Feel free to f***ing quote me on it.			"

												This game has easily provided me hundred of hours of entertainment and the developers show they intend to keep producing new content for this game. Though it has its flaws of certain bugs here and there what really gets me into it is the aspect that every game is different. Do you play as a democratic people trying to unify the galaxy in peace and harmony? Or do you become literally space Hitler and go and a genocideic rampage? it's all up to you. And if you are like me each game could write a whole novel on the events and struggles that my species faces in their 1000 year long reign before fading into myth and legend.I'd even go as far to say that this almost has an RPG feel to it. Playing the role as the God of a species guiding their fate to some divine destiny only you can see. On top of everything, this game has a huge mod fanbase, where you can find a wide variety of things to mix up your games even more.11/10 will be space Hitler again "

												Very good game; a couple of shortcomings that I expect will be addressed in the expansions that are bound to follow. 23 hours /played, still having lots of fun. The AI is weak (at the default difficulty), in war it just follows you everywhere you go. Combat UI is very rudimentary, no real control over the tactics or individual ships. Personally I applaud the decision to move away from micromanaging stuff (à la Galactic Civilizations micromanagement nightmare), having most of it done with a few clicks, but it needs AI improvements to work properly. Still, a very good move.Currently 8 - 8.5/10 for me - a diplomacy / war expansion would make the game 9/10. Stellaris is well worth it.			"

												When you start Stellaris and play it for a couple of hours it's all wonderful, the exploration and early settlement are possible the best you will find in any 4X Game. Even the combat and wars are decent and more enjoyable than most other Paradox games. Ship Design is easy but with enough nuance. Even the none linear research has its charm.However, it's soon starts to fall apart. Here is the secret, the game isn't done yet. It's an Early Access title all but in name. After those couple of magic hours everything starts to fall apart. The second half of the game isn't balanced, game features are minimalistic or outright bugged. Victory conditions are a joke, the type that will make you shed tears of hopelessness and despair. And the interface is absolutely not up to the task of managing a large empire. At some point I found myself just grind for new planets, not even realizing that for the last 10 hours I had finished all the research options and the remaining 12 choices where on a loop.After playing the game for 44 hours I'm left wondering if the developers only play tested the first 3 hours of the game. Paradox, please do right by Stellaris and give us a game that fun from beginning to end.+ Gorgeous graphics and UI+ Nonlinear Research+ Lots of event+ Great customization of races and ships+ Mod support+ MOO like with a touch of Paradox and Galactic Civilzations- Unbalanced, mid to late game is a grind feast- Events are strongly tight to planet colonization- Diplomacy event after the 1.21 patch isn't really engaging or functional- UI becomes an obstacle to manage a large Empire, which isn't optional- Victory conditions are simplistic- Governors to limited and inflexible, but again mandatory for victory- End game event don't even end the game			"

Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. It’s five year mission…I’m not a Trekkie, but if you can imagine William Shatner reading those words at the start of a new game of Stellaris, continue reading.Stellaris is, for Paradox, a new beginning in a long curriculum of strategy games. They have change Earth for the Galaxy and they have done a good game where you can invest a lot of hours just in your first game with your custom race. At the moment of this review, I have played for 33 hours just with my first race and I have seen 1/3 of the galaxy and contacted with just 6 other races. There were some bugs at the previous versions that are fixed and the most common problem is that there are not enough events at mid-end game, but with mods this is not a real problem. Because the mod community is very active in this game.The game, like vanilla, is pretty good: choose race, play with it just at the beginning of space era and start exploring the galaxy with your ships in one of the 3 types of engines you can travel through the galaxy: Warp, like Star Trek. Hyperjump, like Endless space.  And wormholes, like Farscape. Then, first contact with a new galactic empire, politics, alliance, war… All this appears in it’s right moment and you don’t get bored. But it’s really with mods, allowed and promoted by Paradox, that this game really shines: Do you want to play like Klingons, with their ships models and warp adapted to Star trek rules (3 days of cd instead of 20), fighting to Romulans, Feds and Borg?   You can  . To play like the Tau’ri of Stargate?  Yeah  . Or navigate through the space searching for Arrakis like an Atreides?  Yep, that too.  Change your ships, colors, music, rules, hud, planets, races… all you can imagine, is possible, so this game is in fact, a lot of games inside just one.

 Graphics: Beautiful. With the last patch the space boxes has been improved and using two keys you hide the HUD. Sound: Stellaris music is good. Specially the opening theme “Creation and beyond”, which is epic. The others themes are there while you are exploring the galaxy but just as background. Story: Well… you make your own story but in the game there are events that appear on planets, or new contacts or from the orbit of a planet with your science ship, researching the ruins of an ancient culture.  These events start quest chains, which uses to give a boost of science, a plus to damage to the species you are analyzing…  The IA is pretty good. You have 3 levels of difficulty so choose wisely.  Combat: It remembers me Sins of a solar empire. It’s adaptable because you have different weapons with different ranges and accuracy, shields… and a lot of kind of ships.  Race Options: Espionage!! I really miss this. But you have a lot of options to tune up your race: slavery, first contact, emigration, edits to boost science…  Sectors: When you arrive to manage a lot of planets, you can group them into sectors ruled by a governor who will done all for you while you keep managing your most important planets. I could say more, but these points are the most important. If you like what you have read you will be in love with this game, guiding your race… to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.

Some Tips: If you are an achievement hunter, you have to play ""Ironman mode"", that means you have to look at your mods very carefully, because they can be the reason you get no achievement.If you are a screenshot hunter, this game can offer you some very nice shots, if you want to learn more about this, take a look  at my guide  Update/Edit:20 hours more played so I can say something more: Espionage: is not really necessary, it would be nice to know more about your competitors, but when you contact a Race you know each political change done for it, each alliance, each war... This can turn you into madness because, except wormhole FTL, normally you send some explorers ships around the galaxy, and when you met a new race (you get a plus of influence for each new contact)  you let them to research your language to start the communications (if you do it, you will lose time on other research) but when you known about their existence... you will get information of each political movement of ALL of them.Once you see a ship of that race, you can ""analyze"" and see the components, which will tell you their FTL spec, weapons, etc and you can start to adapt your ships in case of war.Sectors: The way to fragment your empire into sectors is very helpful, because now I have about 20 planets, plus ships, plus diplomatic contacts, plus terraforming planets, plus frontier fortifications, plus investigation, plus problems with my robotic population.... soooo really a good idea to let you group  planets to let the IA to manage them for you, building and upgrading buildings and build ships to build stations around planets to get energy, minerals... (a lot of ""build"" there :/) You tell them what to be focused on and that's all. Also, you will continue be allowed to send orders to the orbital stations to build any ship you want, including colony ships.Combat: When you see a new tech about Orbital Station, choose that, because that will allow you to build bigger ships which is the key to win wars. Also, energy and weapons must be balanced to a powerful ship, you won't be allowed to use the biggest weapon if you are with the first energy generator. A nice detail: When you contact the space creatures named ""ameabas"" and you defeat them, you can study their remains. This will allow you to build one of the best ""fighters"" weapon of the game. Combat shipWars:  To start a War, you have to sign a document saying ""WHY"". To get this planet, to integrate him into my empire, to humiliate them... you have to add the reasons, and each one will have a number, which means the ""damage"" you have to inflict to that empire to surrender and negotiate with you the terms. If you have added to the document that you want 2 planets, you can demand them, but you can't ask for a 3rd planet, you have to think before star a war.Wars don't last forever. Even when you fight to a superior Empire that declared war to you, you can stand, hold and with time you will be able to ask ""white peace"", that means a draw. This can sound strange but in game it creates a break in the situacion. Example: I was fighting to an empire, and idiot. During that fight, another Empire declared war to me, not a trouble but he was in a coalition with a very strong Empire who joined the fight. So, I was fighting against 3 empires at once. I could finish one war, and stand with the other 2 empires. They give me a lot of troubles but I hold and could declare white peace, that gives you time to recover yourself and your fleet, change tactics, weapons, search allies, research for more techs and when peace time is over... let's see again our faces. This method gives you and the others empires a way to survive and not be smashed for another one like a bug.   "

												From where I'm standing the game plays like it's in early access. I got my money's worth, but the game is broken in its current state, and I'm done playing it for now. I'll change my review if these issues are addressed.-Huge chunks of features (for example, ""respect tile resources"" under the sector management) are completely broken and do nothing. I won't even begin to list them all, but...-The whole factions and rebellions system is completely dead on arrival. Slaves can't revolt, because they haven't fleshed out the design for how slavery revolts will work yet (or so we are told). So, is there a faction you don't like? Just enslave their pops. -The AI ignores deadly late-game crises that become unstoppable when they are not dealt with quickly, and would probably be way too incompetent to handle them even if they didn't ignore them. If these crises don't happen in your corner of the galaxy you'd better vassalize a path to the crisis, because basic diplomatic needs like military access are impossible without war.-Speaking of which, the vassalization mechanic is completely broken - any empire can be vassalized with 60% warscore, which makes conquering the galaxy comically easy.-AI neightbors usually just sit around and act passive. Some expand more than others, but with the exception of fanatical purifies (who will attack), nothing interesting really happens throughout the course of a game and you will choose who to attack on your terms. The early game is interesting the first time you play it; after that, not so much compared to Civ, EU4, DW, pick your game.-The only way to ""win"" is through conquest of the galaxy, no diplomatic, scientific means, etc.-Once you colonize more than 5-7 planets, the rest will go into sectors which are AI-governened. Unfortunately, the sector management AI is completely incompetent. It builds and then immediately razes farms some times, and other times sits on huge stockpiles of resources and doesn't build anything while your pops sit there severely underproducing because they are working a tile without buildings.-The above problem wouldn't be so bad except as you get to Hard or Impossible difficulty. Your technology cost scales to your population - so for example a large empire has +900% tech cost - so these suboptimized sectors are a huge technology liability. Hard and Impossible difficulties give artificial (50% and 100%) bonuses to all resources, including research, so sectors become a huge technological liability, and in order to keep research parity on hard you willl micromanage every planet.-After they fix the most glaring problems, the random events, crystalline alien lifeforms, etc. are extremely fun on the first playthrough, but quickly become repetitive.

												Stellaris gives you the feeling of running a space empire. The loading screen artwork shows fantastic, alien landscapes, the music has the standard space exploration, epic, feel to it, and the alien portraits are numerous and look great. The superficial ingredient are all there, it looks great and it feels great.Then you actually play the game for a while and the gameplay problems come tumbling out one after another. The central problem in strategy games is what to do about the fact that the guy with the biggest army/empire wins. Paradox's solution to this problem is to make science scale with your empire size and to limit gains from wars to a few planets and throw on a limiting timer. There are no interesting victory conditions, just dominate 40% of the planets. There isn't very much strategy beyond the standard rock/paper/scissors of weapon and defense choices. I almost get the impression the design choices were made to just drag the game out so long, that the ending becomes irrevelevant because no one ever plays that long.Ok, so maybe it's more intended to be a story thing or an empire simulator as opposed to a strategy game. For story, not enough happens beyond the standard mid-game invasion of 3rd party aliens. As an empire simulator, it just feels incomplete. There are clearly mechanics that hint at this, with all the choices to be made for empire traits and their consequences. However there aren't enough input mechanisms - buildings and policies which allow for interesting gameplay with these elements.Stellaris is like someone took a lawn mower and put an awesome space age car shell on it. It's great to drive around and feel everyone looking at your cool car, just don't actually try to race anyone.			"

												Quick recommendation: Not for full price, go for it if it's on saleAs a fan of Paradox grand-strategy games I had high hopes for this 4X game but I'm really disappointed. The first few hours are the most fun, when you are still learning and the noob mistakes you make have consequences, giving you a challenge. However you learn the mechanics of this game VERY fast and once you do the game is very easy. Early game consists of rapid-expansion and colonization of undisovered systems and then choosing to destroy your neighbours or build up an alliance. After that, the game is immesnely boring.The problem with this game is that there is zero depth to anything, combat about building a single doomstack to annihilate your enemy quickly, diplomacy and trade doesn't exist, the game is remarkably easy. The one thing that gave me something to do whilst whizzing through at max-speed was micromanaging my colonies, however due to the sector system I am now penalized massively if I choose to keep my planets outside of a sector - thought o be fair, handicapping myself like this does give me more to manage.I feel like this game was abondoned half-way through development, or they are releasing the rest of the game later as a DLC. Either way, poor effort by Paradox.			"

												Promising game, great visuals, some story, but:1. Lots of mechanics that are clearly broken, like sectors, warscore, AoE weapons (they are not actually AoE despite UI saying so). Some features are useless (missiles), some are overpowered. Looks like game was rushed and those were inserted as placeholder. Some crucial features, like espionage, never made it into release at all. Patches address this by quick-and-dirty decisions (like arbitrary limit on point-defense guns on ship or limiting each ship size to one battle strategy).2. Frustrating and fiddly UI (subspecies management, fleet splitting, army management). To build a proper army, you have to manually click every unit and add an attachment, which is very low-cost and has no drawback. Only problem is clicking a lot.3. No real depth to the game. No supply mechanics, just build anywhere. Only viable strategy for war is doomstacking. Fortificating is useless because even top-tier space defense station can be easily overcome by contemporary fleet, most it can do is shoot down unarmed transports being carelessly sent by AI.4. Events are interesting, deep and varied, but all scripted and you get the same ones every game (mostly), Gets boring after first time.5. Performance gets AWFUL into late game. Expect slow-death.6. AI is dumb, sending numerous unarmed fleets to their death. Only way it can win is via cheating which is called ""difficulty setting"".7. Most of the game is spent micromanaging your planets, ensuring the best positioning of buildings. You have to process each planet manually to achieve good returns, but you can't keep them all under manual control so you have to give them out to ""sectors"". Having only small pool of planets to manage yourself results in frustrating fiddling with sectors. Otherwise you have at best sub-par performing planets, at worst AI management causes happiness to drop and sectors revolt.Free updates are ongoing, but while fixing stuff they kinda break game even further. With recent warscore changes and messing with sectors it's nigh unplayable. And they are already rolling out paid DLC without fixing basic mechanics. Stay away unless in far future they patch this mess up.			"

												I played this game quite a bit by now, 50+ hours.Current patch is 1.2 (Asimov)-------- + Accessible>> I had a much easier time learning this game rather than when I tried HoI / EU4 (without success...)+ Great initial impact and early game>> Cool research technologies (albeit the choices are RNG, which is sometimes irritating) and exploration with science vessels.+ GREAT soundtrack>> My most favourite thing about the game, I listen to it almost daily+ Mod support-------- ~ Average aesthethics>> Nothing special here, the game looks fine for what it is but not outstandingly so.-------- - Unbalanced weapon types>> I can't find a reason to use ballistic weapons, they do only a tiny extra bit of  DPS than lasers which provide huge armor penetration bonuses instead. Missiles are hard countered by defense points.- Lack of mid-endgame content>> Aside a few events at late game, there's not much going on and it quickly turns into a grind. Eventually most technologies get researched, exploration is pretty much done and there's little to do- Zero tactical decisions during ship battles>> You can't give orders for, say, focus certain enemy ships or engage in particular manoeuvers- AI is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥>> Consistently irrational behaviour from AI throughout the whole game.A few examples:1) Getting randomly kicked from alliances / federations for no apparent reason, even when you're saving your allies' asses.2) Someone refused a trade deal where I was simply giving away some extra resources for nothing in return.3) Sector AI is absolutely terrible. Even with plenty of resources (10k minerals / 5k energy) it fails to completely upgrade spaceports, even leaving some planets with just a lvl 1, which forces the player to do it manually. Same goes for spaceport modules.- Performance>> The game seems to mostly utilise 1-2 cores... mid-late game can become quite sluggish, with a 4690K / R9 290 / 16GB / SSD I was often dipping in 20s / 30s (using max time speed)- UI is a mess>> Plenty of things in the UI could be improved (on top of my head, upgrading individual land armies has to be done 1 by 1 and is ATROCIOUS, quick-upgrading spaceports / adding modules from the planet list tab is not allowed.Also, the ship designer could use some love (copy / pasting designs to quickly make small variants, shortcuts to upgrade / downgrade a piece of equipment ...)- Refineries / boosters>> 100% personal opinion, but I hate the way spaceport refinery modules work.They provide great bonuses to the ships built in spaceports where such modules are built, provided you own the strategic resources necessary to build them.The bonuses are huge (like +50% armor, +10% damage...), but existing ships built BEFORE the modules were added cannot be upgraded.That means that you're often delaying construction of ships if you know you can get a refinery in the near future, and also avoiding building ships in other spaceports, where such modules cannot be built for lack of resources.-------- Conclusion: a game with a good first impression and potential but plagued with plenty of issues regarding AI, UI, balance.

												This game has the potential to be great, but only if:1)- You have the patience to give the developers the time to mould and hone it. The complexity and scope of this kind of games require it. It's simply not possible to ""get it right"" at the first try. You need the feedback of thousands of players to make things work. The game is far from perfect at the moment, but it would be unfair to start blaming the developers right now. If in a couple o years the game will still have major issues, then we'll have every right to be angry. But at the moment, I'm perfectly satisfied with what I've got. I'm having a lot of fun with it, and I see that the developers are listening to the players feedback, making changes that they believe will improve the gaming experience. 2)- You do not approach every new game with an ""I've got to win"" attitude, but more likely with ""I will do my best in the situation I'll find myself in"". Winning may simply not be possible, if you get unlucky with your initial hand. But it doesn't mean that you can't have lots of fun, even in the worst situation. In the end maybe you'll be crushed by some fallen empire, get stuck in some remote arm of the galaxy or simply conquered by a stronger opponent. So what? It's part of the realism of the game. I expected it. I would have been disappointed otherwise.			"

												My first 4X ever but it’s not the kind of games that especially interested me. I also wasn’t attracted by 4X because of their visible difficulty but I found Stellaris is accessible for noobs as me. I am still playing my first play !Pros:- Lots of empires, original species- Mods support that add empires, ships, etc.- Nice Visuals- Accessible but not easy as hellCons:- Lack of contents- Plethora of incoming expensive DLC in order to finish the game…Update:It's shame because late game it's really unplayble. i5 6600K @4.5Ghz, GTX 970 EXOC and 16 GO DDR4, I got 1-2 FPS.

												This is the story of the United Nations of Earth Star Empire and how they conquered the galaxy.My empire begun life in a small section of the galaxy named Sol.After a few years of scanning the stars and exploring neighbouring systems I meet a new friendly race. We trade minerals and energy credits and all is well.Shortly after, a fallen empire emerges and demands that we both stop expanding our territories.We form a pact against this new menace, however, even with our combined strength, their power is still 100x that of ours, a lesson we painfully learned when the fallen empire declared war on us and decimated our systems.This pattern goes on for several decades, every few years, declaring war on us, and slapping us around to make sure we knew our place.All the while, a new power, comprised of some very ugly looking aliens, is emerging on the far side of the galaxy, gaining systems, planets, and resources, and is not close enough to the Fallen Empire to be deemed a threat, which will be their undoing.Several decades go by, new races pop up and greet, or insult, us. We trade, we form pacts, we break pacts, until.... the emerging power on the far side of the galaxy is now getting close to the Fallen Empire, this causes border friction and they begin trading insults, until eventually, war breaks out between them. They trade blows off and on for several decades.This gives me and my friend time to colonise some planets and gain some power.Eventually the ugly aliens crush the Fallen Empire down to just two planets, at which point their war ends.This is where it gets interesting, for whatever reason, the Fallen Empire contats me and tells me that I'm ugly and one of the great accidents of the universe, again, he was probably still bitter about the border friction. I've deicded I've had enough, and I send my fleet into his space.I destroy what's left of his infrastructure and land a dozen armies on his planet to capture it. I win the war and effectively wipe him off the map, although, their territory was immediately taken by the ugly aliens, who now control 1/3 of the galaxy.Getting worried, I decide to keep away from them and build up my own forces, expanding away from them for a few decades.During this time, they are getting closer to my border, and they decide to intergrate my neighbour into their empire, my neighbour, is no more. I am alone.No sooner than I realise this do I get a transmission, a race not too far away from me, let's call them the Very Ugly Aliens. They contact me and accuse me of being the ugly one, despite them having more than 1 nose and sounding like a warthog.They don't like me getting close to their borders either. Every few years they randomly throw insults at me, reminding me that my race is doomed, how ugly I am, or that I should never have existed. They aren't a threat though, as their fleet power is inferior to mine, so I let him get on with it.For decades I research the best in weapons and shields technology that I can, slowly building up my forces. I have a sizable fleet when suddenly, a vast amount of large objects enter the outer rim of the galaxy. It takes a few weeks for reports to start coming in, and it appears, it's an invasion force, some to purge all life from the galaxy. They enter the space of the Very Ugly Aliens and begin their purge, being the nice neighbour that I am, I decide to help out, and my fleet gets crushed in the process.The invasion force make the mistake of scattering their fleet across several empires, this makes each force easier to deal with, and, as a galaxy, we manage to fend them off. The United Nations of Earth get the final blow, and we save the galaxy. Although this victory impresses the galaxy and carries some weight with them, it doesn't stop them insinuating that Humans wear clothes to hide their ugly bodies. The usual trade of insults continue.Two new planets emerge from the very ugly aliens and immediately ask for my protection, which I gave. I now have two small allies.Several years go by with little activity, other than me building my huge fleet. Since my fleet is getting so large, I'm running out of power, so I decide to build a Dyson Sphere around a star, this takes decades, but gives me enough power to run any sized fleet I want. I also decide to build the largest sensor array ever seen, which gives me complete coverage of the entire galaxy, I know where every fleet is at every time.At this point, the original ugly aliens now control 50% of the galaxy space, they are getting too big, and must be stopped. They used to be my friends, but have now started trading insults with me due to border friction, and have closed their borders. We declare each other as rivals.Ugly two-nosed warthog aliens are still throwing insults at me, and I decide it's time to shut them up, I declare war, although, I made the mistake of not checking who they were allied with, it was ugly alien 1 who own 50% of the galaxy, and I onwn about 20%. Their fleet power is overwhelming compared to mine, I don't stand a chance.Using my new sensor array, I could track their fleets anywhere they went. A direction confrontation would be fatal to me, so I fall back on good tactics. I play the cat and mouse game. Hitting their space ports, destroying their mining stations, then moving onto the next sector. They decide, instead of chasing me, to bomb Earth back to the stone age. They take control of Earth and Alpha Centuri and move on. As they move off, I swoop back in and regain control of them. I hit their landing parties and small fleets while their larger fleets are attacking other targets.I bomb several of his planets and land my armies on there. I now controll several of his planets, and my fleets hide in wait.He comes back to try and regain control of his planet again. By this point, his fleets are scattered between attacking my sectors, and reclaiming his own. My fleet jumps back into his sector and picks off his smaller fleet, then jumps back out.During this time, all my shipyards and churning out destroyers which immediately come to join my travelling fleet, which just keeps getting bigger and bigger.After several years of hit and run attacks, his fleets and dwindling, and I receive a transmission....""Come now Human, let us end this war before it gets out of control"" Hmmm, nope, I don't think so, he didnt even offer a consession, screen off.I continue my assault for a few more years, he keeps begging for mercy and offering me planets in the hope I'll stop, but I refuse. Eventually he surrenders and gives me several planets that I originally wanted.His fleet is now mostly destroy, warthog aliens are mostly destroyed, and I have taken control of at least 10% of their territory.They have no way to come back from this, and no one else is strong enough to take on my empire. it is only a matter of time before the whole galaxy is mine...

												I give this a tepid recomendation. A lot of Paradox fanboy's are giving this a lot of hype (as other steam reviews will demonstrate), but i don't actually feel this game deserves that much praise. where to startGOOD-Customization is wonderful, it is just awesome-The initial gameplay of explore, colonize, research, fight small skirmishes, and all the other typical 4x systems work enough to make you feel excited and keep you occupied at the beggining of the game.-it good to be able to micro manage planets and not make it feel like a boring chore *cough* CK2 casltes *cough*-the way you research is actually fun and engaging-micro managing fleets, fleet armanents and building defensive structures can actually be really fun.-MULTIPLAYER IS AWESOME, JUST STELLARBAD-diplomacy....what the hell happened to diplomacy??? green and red opinion modifiers are nothing new, but there is no feeling that these other species are alive. its all about getting that trade bar at ""1 green"" when trading and that is all that matters with AI. at least with EU4 and CK2 i felt that there were some ""people"" behind the decisions and not just a literal green modifier that forces them to accept no matter what.-forming alliances and federations is a hassle since the alliance has to approve wars (you can't go solo when in an alliance) and federations change presidents, causing the AI to take control and do something stupid. federations can also overlap with some species, meaning if i attack species ""x"" in federation ""x"" with species ""Y"" who also happens to be a different federation called ""Y"" then it calls both federations Y and X into the war even though i am not declaring on species Y. I don't know if this is a bug, but its dumb ethier way.-battles are non interactive and you can barely see all those minor improvements you painstakingly updgraded and researched for your fleets.-science ships and construction ships become a hassle in the late game since you have to manually control them, take a lesson from Civilzation and add an explore or auto build button.-planets become a hassle as you get to the late game, making it clear the UI was clearly not designed for super late game.-wars take way to long at the late game, i have spent 30 years sieging half this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s planets and destorying his fleets. but he won't surrender because there is no war exhaustion system, at least i don't believe so.to sum it up. early game-mid game are quite fun, but late game is a micro managing hell that the UI was not designed for, wars are not that interesting due to how stale the battles are, and diplomacy is boring. However, all these problems (not the UI one, but i can live with that) are fixed by the stellar mulitplayer and that was what this game was really designed for considering how Paradox marketed it for. hell the first button on the home screen is multiplayer and not single player. i just wish more time and energy went to the UI and single player.

												Current verdict (6/26/2016, version 1.1): No.There are several things that you expect from a 4X and several things that you expect from Paradox when you keep in mind they've had ages perfecting their designs through Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings, etc. So do they deliver?The game as a 4X-title and what Paradox does bestArguably one of the most important elements of this genre is missing. Expanding your empire only really happens through extermination, rarely if ever through diplomatic means. The method to do so is still as bland as in Europa Universalis. You vassalize and run down the clock, until you can click that magical button to integrate/annex. At least, EU still had some parameters to fulfil, make sure to match religion, realize that certain government types cannot be annexed through certain methods, and so on. There is something missing. It is something to worry about because diplomacy is generally not Paradox's strong suit. Can they still fix it?This also holds true for exploration of both the map and technology. The first few runs in the game will be great. There are new events popping up, some funny, some great references and generally good stuff. However, as you increase the number of restarts you'll notice there are too few events. You will run the same quest lines over and over again with each and every one of your empires. And as the game drags on, fewer and fewer new events will pop up. Now this is very much fixable, since it just needs more time. And I fully expect this content to be (p)added. What is slightly worrysome though is how barebones it is compared to previous Paradox titles. If anything it feels rushed. (And even though I am not necessarily against DLC expansions, I have to say that I am slightly worried about how many DLC packs it's going to take to turn this into a living galaxy.)What I do love about the game is the initial feeling. Setting up your own alien race, designing (get mods to add options though) your empire, and then starting out on a single planet,  it all feels great. You'll explore the system, and then warp to the next. The first time it feels exciting. Unfortunately this excitement comes down a little when you realize the AI is extremely passive, refuses most advanced trade agreements and is just not fun to deal with. They do each have their own  character traits (the same way you can set out to be a xenophobic militarist) but apart from the greeting messages they don't seem to actively pursue their own goals.Can they fix it?Now, they do have a seemingly solid foundation for the game. It looks quite good and I don't necessarily agree with others that the UI is horrible. It's quite similar to previous Paradox-titles, which have always been a bit cluttered. Certainly there are some things that should intuitively work that don't. (Mostly shortcuts like going to the planets overview and not being able to assign orders from there.) However, I think the UI-issues are mostly fixable, especially since mods have shown that it is possible to reduce the amount of nuisance.My main concern is how they are going to fix the non-event based gameplay. Paradox is great at having event chains with interesting and funny dialogue but given the lack of a historical background between the empires there has to be more in there to keep the game flowing when it's not directed through events. Diplomacy needs a major overhaul and so does trading. There needs to be more activity in space. More rogue empires or rogue planets. Even if empires are not going to war with eachother as much, there still needs to be action. Especially planets far from the home system need to be more susceptible to revolt. Common threats in the galaxy only pop up near the end to ""finish"" the game. The most damning argument to Paradox having rushed the game is the fact that pirates only pop up once, and always at the same time, every playthrough. They spawn in a system close to you and then attack one of your stations. You kill them, and that's it. It almost feels like a placeholder event.I am sure that people will disagree with me and say that Paradox is great, not at all like EA, Ubisoft and what have you, but I am not a fan of their heavy reliance on DLC. Yes, they add a lot of content (mostly a whole bunch of events, with one added mechanic) but added up it does cost quite a bit. My OCD forces me to get the complete package, which is why I usually wait until I can get a gold edition or something. I decided to give Stellaris a go so I could get into it before the DLC packs start flying. And I can't help but feel it is very empty after those first few times you play. So it is with a heavy heart that I await how much I have to invest to get the real experience.So should I get it or not?Currently I would say no. I loved the initial hours. It was great. If I had written my review after the first 10 hours it would have been a definite recommendation. But having gone past the early excitement I can't recommend it. It's a teaser. Along the lines of Early Access, I suppose. We get to see what it's like and now we have to wait until the expansions hit the store.I'm sure it will be great after a few DLC packs. If you're a patient man I would wait for the bundle.			"

												9/10The game is awesome. It's smooth, elegant, sounds great, looks great, and is stable. This is no trivial game that you can master, finish and discard in a couple dozen hours. I imagine this is a game I will continue playing for months, if not years, especially as new content is released. Stellaris is a STRATEGY game, and makes no bones about it, as there is barely even a nod towards tactical elements.The one thing I love about Stellaris above most other games in this genre .... there are actual STAR SYSTEMS, not just planets floating in space or arbitrary placeholders. Ships which warp or jump into a system have to traverse the system or wait for their jump drives to cool down before they can jump again. As an immersive factor, this WORKS for me.The nature of the game is TOTALLY suited to modding and customisation. I can imagine people designing the entire star wars galaxy or star trek galaxy or empire of man or warhammer 40k universe or starcraft universe in this. I literally cannot wait to see what modders will do in terms of race design, 3d models, static galaxy designs, story driven gameplay, event chains, etc.Stellaris has given a massive POKE IN THE EYE to those who think 4x games cannot encompass multiple stardrive types and should be simplified to managing hyperlane bottlenecks. You will love it if- you like sandbox games- you want control of customisation- you want to set your own goals, and drive your own agenda- you love science fiction stories, as the anomalies and events in the game are like a story unfolding, absolutely amazing.You will hate it if- you are a twitch gamer wanting a rail-shooter in space- you want the game to drive the agenda for you- you just wanna kill things and couldn't be bothered to read.Being a sandbox, i imagine it will suit the multiplayer environment much better than the single player environment, but it is still an awesome single player experience.There are a few things missing, but they detract very little from the game experience.- there are only randomly generated games, no campaign modes- there are no freighters, passenger ships, trade routes, etc.- the game is pseudo 3d, and effectively plays out on a flat galaxy map- no tactical combat mode, but its well done, with combat seamlessly playing outin real time on the strategic map.- current diplomacy is not that complex, no espionage, sabotage, etc. But the sheer number of species and diversity adds its own complexity.- being a sandbox, there is currently no campaign, but I am sure the modding community will solve this.- while there are leaders (governals, admirals, scientists, etc) with traits, experience and skills, they are randomly generated, not a result of a complex relationship engine as in CK2. Not a big deal to me, but I imagine some would have hoped for this. I can imagne a system like rome total war with governing families leading factions might have worked.Many of the tricks the designers missed in the realease version, I imagine can be added in future content, or through modding.

												I have been through most of them space 4x games.MOO series, Endless space, Endless Space 2...And in all of them, something went missing, i couldn't plug myself to those games for more then 3 hours.But then  I discovered this game.Its incredible, its like the developers really did their homework on what makes a space 4X both interesting, innovative and different from the competition.To start off.Unlike endless space, which is a big excel spreadsheet with a graphic engine and very hostile to new players, stellaris's learning curve is fair, while not simple at first glance, the tutorial AI puts you on track through your first few hours.Unlike all 4X space games, this is no turn based game, which is a huge plus for me at least, its real time with a pause option, and the game's pace is balanced perfectly with it.Research projects feels important, there are plenty of them, and none of them feel like a ""filler"" or just projects you ""rush through"" with disregard like most 4X games.There is strategy and thinking involved there, which can result in different outcomes.Paradox did well to adress the ""everyone research the same tech"" problem that plagues most 4x games.Because of the game's robust costumization system, you will find yourself in a different research and tech pathes than your opponenets.Talking about costumization, its outstanding.Stellaris lets you costumize your empires ethics and goals, which shape out your gameplay and ethos.You can be a space hitler and conquer by force, or you can use diplomacy, alliances, annexion to achieve victory.And in addition to that, you get different benefits in terms of special tech, buildings, diplomacy and bonuses depending on your path to victory, every ethos and game play get its own set of tools for the job.Stellaris's ""Explore"" criteria is done really well, as you explore the galaxy you discover anomalies, (which serve more then boring cash rewards), they can result in quests, unlocking better research/mineral nodes on star systems, special ships and sometimes rare planets.In addition, in terms of movement through the galaxy, the game has the best of all worlds.If you like hyperlanes like in MOO and sins of the solar empire, you got it.If you hate hyperlanes and prefer unrestricted movement through warp travel, you got that covered as well.And if you like something a abit different you have wormholes.The space combat in stellaris feels great, while you don't have direct control of your ships during the battle itself, you do have control of everything else, think of like playing ""Manager football games"".You can build and costumize your ships and loadous, and there are a very big variety of weapons and modules you can play with.You can give them beheviors via said modules (aggressive rush, or keeping formation for long range engagments).The game has great events and quests that can pop out of nowhere and give some interesting lore and RP elements as well as good rewards, and helps breaks the routine.The endgame of stellaris also has few surprises it can throw at you when you thought you already won.A sudden invasion of zerg-like creatures or energy beings that threaten to wipe all life from the galaxy pumps you back on your feet and require a direct response.Fallen empires, dormant factions with superior tech and fleets offer great risk and high rewards for tackling them.The planet interface and building layout lets you costumize your planet and its role in your empire.I can keep going on and on and on, its just astounding the depth and features this game has, Im 100hr+ and i still discover new things in my play through.Highly recommended.

												I put this game on my wishlist several months ago and then proceeded to completely forget about it. Talk about a pleasant surprise when I rediscovered it 2 days before it was released. This game is incredible, it's everything that Civ BE and Starships could never be. The level of detail and intricacy is staggering. I love eerything I've seen in my first session, from the way the galactic map shows your influence growing to the way every single thing can be renamed and tweaked to your liking. Did I immediately create my own civilization based on Freespace? Yes, yes I did.The only cons I've experienced so far are that your science ships will immediately run from hostile fleets, you can't just hide them on the other side of the system until the enemy warps off. That and the choose your own adventure style of research isn't really my thing, but that's more a personal preference.Can't recommended enough to someone looking for a space themed 4X game.			"

												Stellaris is probably the easiest to play by the normal standards of Paradox Interactive's grand strategy games. Certainly it isn't as overwhelming as the Victoria series or the EU series. I admit I was more than a little frustrated to hear the annouancement of a space 4x game since we're not exactlty short of them right now and that I was hoping to see Victoria III.Also Stellaris didn't feel like it was complete when it was released. Things like choosing wargoals or diplomacy was clearly not in a finished state at the beginning (though recent patches have fix a lot of that). Still, Stellaris is far from a bad game. Much like the city building game Cities: Skylines, it feels like Paradox is drawing a lot of influence and even bits of the UI from other games (for Stellaris some of it looks a little like Civilization own 4x sci-fi game). But Stellaris has enough of its own identity.You really get the feel of taking a small single planet and forging an empire that spans hundreds of worlds (which is possible if you have a computer to support the largest maps). I really like how there aren't set empires, but rather a pool of traits, appearances, and abilities that can appear so you never know what nation you will face. Will it be a bunch of peace loving terrifying looking space spiders or will you fight religious xenophobic adorable space foxes? You can of course customize your own empire from choosing your species to government and even what its call, the ship prefexes, the title of your leaders.You can be a kind leader who leads a democratic peace loving pacifists who grant robots and aliens equal rights and hopefully not have a neighbor who stomps a mudhole in you. Or you can be space Hitler. Because it isn't a real Paradox stragety game if you don't have those kind of choices.Stellaris is a pretty good game that will probably be the easiest for new players unfamiliar with Paradox's stragety games to cut their teeth on and will have enough depth to keep veterans satisfied (though in that case you may want to explore some of the mods).I feel comfortable recommending it, but as always you should look up let's plays to see the gameplay yourself and determine if this is a game you would enjoy. Make sure it is version 1.2 or newer because the 1.0 and pre-launch builds were patched a lot.			"

												First of all, to make things clear — Stellaris is by no means a bad game. However, reading the community reviews here one would think that it is the ""promised game""  of the strategy genre, some people describing it as the ""best strategy game"" and such. This surprises me. In my experience, Stellaris is a fairly bland game that doesn't bring much (or maybe even  anything) new to the table. Its definitely playable and even enjoyable, but it gets boring and tedious fairly quickly. I wouldn't know if it has a lot of depth, as others often claim about it. It certainly has a lot of ""breadth"" though, in form of modifiers that affect all kinds of stuff as well as small micromanagement minigames. One needs to learn all that stuff in order to be successful. At the same time, the sole purpose the minigames seems to keep the player occupied. Take for instance the planet management. Its still the basic old assign-props-to-tiles-and-build-improvements minigame we know from many games before, made slightly more 'complex' by adjacency bonuses. Yes, it gives the player something to do and it seems to offer a 'choice' — but this choice is merely an illusion. In the end, optimal tile development is a linear optimisation problem (what gamers often refer to as min-maxing), an additional puzzle game within the larger game where the player is rewarded by playing the puzzle well and punished by playing it badly. I never understood why I have to play puzzle games of this sort when I want to play a 4X strategy game. Now, while Stellaris generally is quite micromanagement-heavy (planetary survey being one of other annoying things), it also attempts to cut down on micromanagement by introducing sectors, which are basically ""AI"" assistants that take over management of planetary systems. However, they do it spectacularly badly. The funny thing is that the planet development minigame can be solved by the computer optimally. This is not a particularly difficult problem and algorithms to solve it have existed for decades. Not within the Stellaris universe apparently. Other things that disappoints: the diplomacy system, trading and don't get me started on the leader system. First of all, leaders/heroes have a limited life span, which sounds like a neat feature on paper but is incredibly annoying in practice. Second, leaders can be elected president, which immediately stops them from doing what they are doing and essentially removes them from the game. You need to manually(!) look through all your leader assignments, find out/guess which slot now became empty and hire/find a replacement. Combat is ok, even though quite basic. Some more control of fleet tactics would be nice (such as ordering sniper ships to at least try keep their optimal distance from the opponent). All in all, in my view at least, Stellaris is mostly a combination of old and not very exiting ideas in a new package. Now, there are some things that are quite neat, like the heavy utilisation of random events (storytelling, research, etc.) which do offer meaningful choices. But the tedious micromanagement and non-exiting gameplay are still big downers in my book. I would have wished for the game to try more advanced/novel solutions instead of pushing the player into the old boring micromanagement minigames.  "

												It's.. Not quite done yet. Lots of potential, but there are some very basic features missing (trade, espionage, some method for victory other than 'conquor everyone through force of arms'), the UI needs some work (want searchable planet lists, please), the AI (race, combat, and sector) is kind of weak, and there are a number of (major and minor) balance issues. Still, I truly do see a lot of potential in it, and I will probably revisit the game (and my reviews) once the 1.1 patch drops in a week or three.﻿			"

												So first I should note that I am a long-time Paradox game player.  I'm used to the foibles and nuances of their games, as well as their development process.I found the game very fun as is. There are some weaknesses, but nothing that prevents me from enjoying the game. It's not perfect, but it has enough depth, novelty, as well as modding support to sink countless hours into the game. However, I also know that Paradox is in it for the long haul. They will continue to flesh out and develop their games for years. I endorse their games knowing that they will only get better with time, and they aren't afraid to overhaul major game mechanics if they aren't quite right, almost all for free. It's a unique style of development, more like an MMO. If you just want a perfect experience right now, play the game and just forget about it, then this may not be the game for you, yet. You can wait and get a more evolved version of the game later. As for me, I will enjoy the richness of the current experience, and watch as the community and developer together explore and evolve a fantastic and unique game.			"

												I own and actively play most of paradox's other 4X strategy games, ie: Vicky 2, europa universalis 4 crusader kings 2 etc. I have to say that this game was a dissapointment for me compared to those. I found that it was a lot less in depth and it quickly beagn to bore me after a meager 10 hours or so of gameplay. Now that being said if you are big into the space exploration and expansion genre then you may like it. Otherwise if you simply enjoy the other paradox games and want to try this one, don't. That is unless it is on a very good sale. Thank you for reading this and keep in mind this is simply my own opinion and you may have different views on the game after you play it.			"

												My first impression of this game was very good. It has some very interesting concepts and is a mixture of Europa Universalis 4 and traditional 4X space strategy games.However, after playing for 15 hours, I now have the feeling that I am playing an unfinished version of Europa Universalis 4.For example, in EU4, you are told by the game why an ally is refusing to go to war with you, i.e. because he has good relations with your enemy or because he currently cannot afford another war because he is still recovering from a previous war. In Stellaris, however, you simply are told that your ally is saying no, without providing any hint on the reasons why he is doing so.I have also encountered several serious bugs in the game.I assume that Paradox (the publisher and developer) will continue to develop the game and improve it significantly, as it has done with EU4. Quite a few of these improvements for EU4 were free. However, many were very expensive. Currently, if you buy all DLC for EU4, it will cost you over 220 Euros, which is equivalent to 250 US-Dollars. I'm afraid that Stellaris will suffer the same fate.If Paradox improves the game as it has done with EU4, and if it changes its DLC policy to a more reasonable one, I will gladly change my rating to a positive one.

Posted: May 14, 2016
												This game is getting a lot of amazing reviews on Steam, but it really doesn't deserve them *at this point*, as the game has a tremendous amount of problems.By far the biggest problem is the lack of a competent UI and some very basic automation features.  For example, there is no screen from which you can see/give build orders to your spaceports.  Likewise, there is no way to rally production from your spaceports.  This all makes building up a fleet in a large empire unnecessarily tedious.  Upgrading ships also feels like it wasn't playtested.  There is a flat time cost to upgrading a ship regardless of how much you're changing on it - and that cost is very close to the time cost of building a completely new ship.  This means it isn't usually worth upgrading ships for marginal improvements, and makes upgrading large fleets quite tedious.  Unless you want your fleets to be locked in dock for a *very long time* you need to split them up multiple times and then scatter them across your empire, keeping in mind that, again, you have no way of telling where your spaceports are short of manually searching every system on the map.Now, producing/upgrading ships isn't a problem in the early game when you only have a few systems.  But the scale of Stellaris means that by the late game you may have upwards of 100 systems, at which point the poor UI makes these very core, basic tasks overwhelmingly tedious.  The game would be infinitely better if there was just a screen that you could control and rally production from, if the time cost of upgrading a ship was based on the work actually being done to the ship, and if there was a button you could click that would just automatically break a fleet up into smaller chunks and send them off to be upgraded.  Or, alternatively, a way to just set spaceports to contribute their production to a centralized spaceport.  For example, if every spaceport in a sector automatically added its production capacity to the sector capital spaceport so that the capital spaceport could very rapidly produce/upgrade ships while the rest of the sector's spaceports were inaccessible.  There is also no autoexplore option for your science vessels, which isn't a huge deal in the early game but in an 800 star sized map, you basically just reach a point where you stop exploring because you've explored your immediate area of the galaxy and exploring the far off reaches is extremely tedious and of very limited strategic value.  *Every* 4x game released in the last 4 years has had an autoexplore feature, and for Stellaris not to have one is inexcusable. Which leads me to the main point of why the game sucks in its current state - which is that it just doesn't feel like it was playtested past the first few hours (which is something that Paradox is notorious for).  The basic systems and mechanics in the game are all good and fun, but their implementation is just poor in general.  And that poor implementation itself just comes from things being slightly off - things that don't require much testing to notice or much work to fix.  I could probably write a doctoral thesis on all of the small things wrong with diplomacy, sectors, fleet combat, and the UI (other than what I've already mentioned), but its probably easier and more effective to just sum the current problems up with an analogy.  The current state of Stellaris feels like if you hired someone to paint your house, and while he did a good job on what he painted he also left small sections of every room unpainted.  You would look at that and say ""I mean sure he knows what he's doing but he needs to get back in here and finish painting the walls.""  Thats basically Stellaris.None of its current problems feels like they will be hard to fix, and Paradox has a history of continuing active development on their games.  In fact, Stellaris is no different than any other Paradox game in that respect - with Paradox games you always pay full price for a beta version of the game that gets its major problems fixed over the next 6 months in patches, with major feature improvements regularly released as $30 DLC.  Its just dissapointing because starting with HOI3 they promised to stop doing the whole ""paying for a beta"" thing.  But they haven't yet made good on that promise and Stellaris is no exception.  If you're looking to buy Stellaris I would hold off right now and check back in a month or two once the game has been patched a bit, because right now it really needs it.			"

												Stellaris is a cool game for those who like a sort of RTS which isn't totally real time. I played several games of this solo and multiplayer. If you like endlessly building a space civilization this is kind of good. I have to say the art direction, the sound, the idea behind this was solid.Sadly what really drives me away from this game is the sheer tedium of later gameplay. It's not terribly challenging nor is it frustratingly difficult. It's just boring. There's almost too many things to be worried about and very little in the way of automating a lot of the little things. When you do automate you take a penalty in resources for doing so.  The other major drawback this game suffers from is how easy it is to play the 'I win' race. You'd think it would be fun to play a guns blazing 'we hate all xenos' empire but that's just setting yourself up for failure. You have to be diplomatic, you have to be happy, and ultimately the easiest way to win is just being the friendly blob that absorbs all the other space empires and keeps them all happy. At the current time of my playing that's really the only victory condition. Suck up everything. There needs to be work done on more victory conditions and balancing playstyles. With so many possible variables it seems like a very difficult task. I still occasionally check on this game but as far as strategy games go it's certainly not one of my favorites.			"

												This game is essentially too little jam spread across a piece of toast. Early-Mid-Late, Rinse/Repeat The early game is easily the strongest part of the game. You design your civilization. You keep it on normal speed – hope for good resources in your starting system. You send out your science ship and get to see all the cool little events. You choose how to expand.By the mid-late game what are you doing? Speed set on fastest. Research just comes up with +5% upgrades. You send your blob of ships against another blob. The end game events are just the same few things each time. Then when you replay you find yourself repeating those things. You see the same events and same techs. Replays become as boring as your late games! Flavour You spend all the time making a civilization and the differences between you and another race end up being.. well.. not a lot. A few numbers of diplomacy points between neighbours, a few odd buildings here and there. Where is the flavour?The game doesn't feel like a Space Opera. The galaxy map is uninteresting and not alive, both in terms of scenery doing nothing and ships doing nothing. Where are sweeping asteroid fields stopping your development until you get tech to go through them or black holes trapping and destroying ships? Where are trade routes and civilian ships moving between planets as commerce and people move? Where are the politics between civilizations and laws within federations?The ships you build will be similar to the last lot of ships you built and the other races will have similar ships and the same techs. It ends up feeling like numbers on a screen. Your differences between your neighbours do not matter a lot and they should- for a game built around your specific civilization the differences should feel interesting. Nit Picks and Systems Some systems, like war, are guaranteed to make you frustrated. In one war the enemy could not invade my planets, they were too well defended. As they had a higher war score they put forward a offer of a peace. To reject these deals I was paying 100 influence without noticing. I ran out of influence and lost half my empire (despite the fact the war was not yet lost). Federations are guaranteed to get you into several wars without you knowing it; often to the extent that it is better to go it alone than to join with them. The Future I am sure that more features will be introduced in more DLC. Mods also do make great additions to the game. There is enough content here to get you through some binge days of playing but eventually you will grow to be apathetic.			"

TL;DR - I can't recommend the game in its current state, wait a few years until DLC comes out to ramify the game or play with mods which will break anyway.Paradox games are like wines, over time they age and gradually become better (with a gratuitous sum of money worth in DLCs of course).However, Stellaris isn't nearly close to being a wine, to begin with. I honestly did expect much more from the game after jumping into a singleplayer game for the first time, and there are some features which are just outright missing. Lack of Political DecisionsOne of the biggest gripes I've had was the fact that there's no concept of the game where crucial political decisions determine anything significant. As far as I'm concerned, I could easily complete the game by subjugating my neighbors and calling it a day, which is essentially the core of the game in itself. Internal affairs within your empire don't seem to do much considering that the only two functions of manging internal strife include: suppressing dissident factions and electing your next ruler (that's even if your government type supports elections in the first place). Occasionally, you'll get a dialogue window asking you to make a decision which typically won't change much anyway. No Automation I have to say that maybe 80% of the time spent was just building resources, surveying systems, and upgrading planets. Waging war or actually conducting diplomacy was arguably the least of the things I was doing. There are few options to automate anything. There are sectors, but the manner in which the AI handles them is atrocious and still needs work even after the devs did some updates. Diplomacy Needs Serious Work I mentioned before that sector AI is moronic. However, diplomacy in this game is on par with the AI in Civ V. That is to say, the AI empires are brain-dead. If you're a xenophobe, it is a feature that might as well be absent from the game because making any deal will hit you with that -1000 acceptance from the other party. Federations are outright incomplete and serve no other purpose than to recurrently elect a new leader. Perhaps in a DLC they will actually mean something, but now Federations stand to be just a better version of an Alliance. Other Missing Features I've laid down the biggest things that♥♥♥♥♥♥me off about the game, but there are some other things which I haven't elaborated on, but are missing  The spiritualist ethos should actually be tied to some sort of religion mechanic, but it's not.  There's no point of using ship-builder in multiplayer, it's always just auto-best to keep up with the game.  The midgame just drags on so horribly, and the crises don't even make up for it  Steam Workshop modders offer much more than what the developers do with the current state, but I hate having to wait for those things to be updated.

Product received for free
												A few of us the other day found ourselves trying to come up with words to explain to others what Stellaris felt like and we settled on: ""Civ 5 meets EU4, but in space and a lot cooler!"" Yeah, that works. *nods*Like Europa Universalis 4, Stellaris is a grand strategy 4X game: explore, expand, exploit, exterminate. Unlike EU4, if you've never played this type of game before you probably won't need a bottle of wine, 2 spa days, and vacation to relax after trying to learn it. (Okay, I exaggerate and confess I only needed a couple of glasses of wine and one long weekend to recover from my first (delighted, dazed, and confused) hours in EU4.)Grand strategy indeed; you will be exploring space, managing resources and influence, keeping your people happy, colonizing and building, deciding ethical matters, terraforming, pushing the boundaries of science, making or breaking alliances, building ships and armies, waging wars or trying not to, and spreading your own special brand of All The Things across the glittering universe.However....you've probably already heard, ""Stellaris is accessible"". Yes, it is! The tutorial behaves like a proper host and shows you around the place with kindness and interesting explanations and a welcoming attitude. The game starts slow and easy; you'll have lots of time to click on buttons, read well written explanations, and poke around the place. The learning curve meanders gently into the game and gives you lots of time to breathe and don't worry be happy. And little flashy bits up top warn you of the things you really need to pay attention to anyway. What could possibly go wrong?Then of course, being a Paradox Interactive grand strategy game you will land on your backside (repeatedly I expect) with a resounding thump, be surprised by things you didn't seen coming, delighted with new lore that hadn't come up before, and stunned by the variety of ways in which you can get it wrong, get it right, win all the things today, or go out in high drama and ranging storms tomorrow.As you expand and there are endless details to take care of you create 'sectors' and tuck some things aside to manage themselves (under your orders) and supply you with lootz while you make friends and influence people and wage war in the neighborhood. But, if you just love micromanaging all the things, you can do that too.And then there is modding; this game is as customizable as you want to deal with. Off to the Workshop with you!If you like space games this is my favorite of the last 20 years (I was addicted to Sierra's Outpost back in the olden days, bugs and all).If you like character creation, this alone could be worth buying the game. Seriously, it's awesome fun! :DIf you love EU4 (or are terrified of it but secretly always wanted to try) you're going to love Stellaris.If you've never considered playing grand strategy 4X games Stellaris may be the open door, with the welcoming host, that changes your gaming life forever.Now, gotta run, I have a new colony to get sorted. Have fun!#makespaceprettyagainEdited: PS. Shoulda said, I'll let you know if I find something about it I don't like. That just hasn't happened yet.			"

												You should not purchase this game in its current state. It is an early access/open beta title in all but name.-Developers have made two save game-breaking patches in two months for the release version of the game. It begs the question of whether or not they performed any internal testing at all. (Rolling back to the previous patch is not a real solution as I as the consumer should not have to do that and cannot think of any other studio that is that sloppy).-Developers do not seem to have a clear vision of how they want their game to work. Major mechanics changes, including the removal of embassies, nerfing/buffing of empire ethics/traits, etc.-Warfare is pretty broken. Apparently planetary occupation used to be required to capture planets from an empire at the end of a war; however, this was removed because the AI apparently could not handle it. The developer's solution was to remove this requirement. The effect was to render ground forces essentially useless, as with space superiority you can win by just wrecking random space stations and blockading planets without ever setting foot on them. The actual solution should have been to fix their broken AI.-Defence stations are less than useless and actually serve as free warscore (basicly victory points towards winning a war) for all but the weakest enemy fleets. Bounus points for allowing the idiotic sector governors to auto-build them in the latest patch. Consider this: the strongest station is about the equivalent of a battleship and the same upkeep. The sole difference? It can't move.-With the removal of embassies, all AI factions essentially distrust/hate you from the opening gate. Diplomacy now consists of making massive bribes. Not to say that embassies were a perfect solution, but this really isn't any better.- The UI is clunky at best, and during major wars you'll receive so many attack notifications your head might explode.This all said, the game is rather promising and has a lot of appeal, including the ability really RP your empie as anything from a diverse multi-species democracy to a slave-taking, planet exterminating dictatorship. The random events are pretty interesting and tend to make each of your worlds and playthroughs unique.However, until Paradox can finally settle on how they want the internal mechanics of the game to actually work, I cannot in honestly recommend buying this game unless you want to become frustrated with each new update.

A Romp & Stomp Through the Stars The Grand Strategy/4X Hybrid that is a true paradox on a 2D map, with mechanics that feel so 3D you’ll forget you’re not in space. To explain the basics of Paradox Studio’s latest thrill ride, a riddle: In a rectangular room, 30’X12’X12’, a spider is at the middle of an end wall, one foot from the ceiling. The fly is at the middle of the opposite end wall, 1 foot above the floor. The fly is scared & can’t move. What is the shortest distance the spider must crawl to capture the fly? Are you scratching this out on paper already? Either way, Stellaris is likely for you. Gameplay focuses on combat & exploration. The Math is done by the game. Everything: from the stats the AI uses, to the strength of opposing forces in battle, is transparent in the game. You explore the Galaxy, but have to fight for control. Features include land armies, naval ships you can build to spec, & pirates.Grand Strategy: Grand Strat is a balancing act of managing many complex features of the game at once like a waitress with arms loaded with plates. But here, instead of micro-managing, you have the unique ability to delegate whole Solar Systems to Sector management by the AI, while you concentrate on the macro-management/ big picture dev of your empire. You control the leaders, Scientists, & Construction Ships (CS) that carry out your orders. Simply clicking on the sun of a solar system (SS), while having a CS selected, will present order options so that you can queue up research stations (RS) or mines for the whole SS for example. But, anytime you don’t like the direction something is going, you can seize control & redirect. 4X Popular for a Reason: I love TBS 4X games like Civ 5, where you accumulate wealth & dominate the world to the tune of a victory condition, while taking turns with the AI civs. Traditionally, Grand Strat games leave that aside for a strictly sandbox style where you walk out on the world stage and wonder what to do 1st. But, Stellaris is like a gateway drug into the world of Grand Strat. You can see the basic goals of the game, & you know where you want to go, without any hand-holding.Gameplay: The goal of the game is to wander the galaxy, researching as many SS’s as you can, while building colonies, mines, or RS’s on them. The zone around the outside of your empire is your known world, which you push outward as you explore with your ships. You can’t build there, unless you totally explore the SS, & then build a frontier outpost on the star to push out the borders of your empire in any direction you outpost. Then it’s yours & you can build. But, you are limited by resources, energy, & especially influence, because it builds up slowly over time. Certain tasks, like meeting leader mandates, will give bonuses in influence. Build a decent navy of at least 2 fleets. Send 1 fleet with the Science ship, & 1 with the CS, & zip from planet to planet laying claim. Just be careful not to “forward settle” the AI empires. If you claim a star close to an AI, they see this as aggression, and they will destroy you before you’ve had time to build a big navy. Cautiously, take stars to either side of AI, & leave buffer stars until you are ready to fight. Meanwhile, you will encounter either “nasty aliens” if you are a Xenophobe, or intriguing alien races, if you have a Xenophile type personality. You can either fight or flee to safe planets in the early game stage of exploration & colonization. In the mid-game, you must begin to form alliances & trade networks, or begin waging war to take resources from other empires. Late game, game-changing special events occur. Winning & losing: Unlike most grand strat games, Stellaris has winning conditions. You can win by domination, or by colonizing 40% of the habitable planets. To score achievies, you must select Ironman mode, which is really no big deal in Paradox games. Many achievies are easily obtained without winning the game.Emergent Story-telling: Stellaris reminds me of XCOM in the way you get to choose which research you will focus on, directing your own course. Meanwhile, event chains are unraveled through popups, with story to read. It gives the added romp of a great RPG by allowing you to see unexpected events unfold in a Sci-fi narrative that is extremely playful & intriguing. Pros: *Narrative is extensive; Soundtrack, Graphics & art are great *DLC provides enjoyable ringtones, e-book novel & artbook *Feature Rich & Fully customizable creative experienceCons: *Tutorial an annoyance to be turned off; see key mapping in options*Situation Log sketchy; Outliner needs to be longer to view more info*MP causes desync issues on low-end machines/ rural satellite internet Stellaris is a stellar Sci-fi strategy game with extreme re-play value. With 100+ hours in the week since release, the game is addictive, time-consuming, & one of the best gaming experiences in the galaxy. I highly recommend it for gamers of all ages who enjoy info intensive strategy games.			"

Review for StellarisAt full price? I can't recommend, for a number of reasons, of which I will go into further into this review. TL;DR would be that it is a pretty shallow and though polished, it is rather undeveloped and the developers have purposesfully left a lot to want in preparation for DLC spam.If you want to know what sort of spam, just look at CK2's DLC list. Fourty plus items, if I recall correctly. Although you can get them pretty cheap given enough time during sales, it is still a hefty amount for a hefty sum.At a sale price or after some updates and possibly an expansion or two, Stellaris could very well be worth the money spent. However, at this point in time it is impossible to know exactly where it will go.Paradox is good at making feature rich games like Crusader Kings 2 (CK2), Europa Universalis IV (EUIV), but getting there takes time. Some of their games have had rocky starts and have a decent amount of content, others like Stellaris have had thus far a smooth and stable start, but are very much lacking in content.The Good+ Stable multiplayer. Did an eight-hour long game with twenty others in a group I play with without a single hiccup at all. Smooth as silk, with working hotjoin! A big surprise, given how broken multiplayer is in say, Crusader Kings 2 at times.+ Diverse selection of species. Unfortunantly they don't have quite as big as an impact as one might wish for, more onto that later. But cool designs and a reasonably large number to choose from, which is always sweet.+ You can customise your starting ethics and racial traits. All species have access to the same traits sadly. Ethics/Ethos allow you to be peaceful, militaristic and so on. You can make your political makeup somewhat unique compared to other playthroughs. Only a couple are actually viable for competetive multiplayer, though.+ Ship editing and customisation. It's there, it does the job. Not the most sophisticated system around, and somewhat lacking compared to other games in the genre.+ Purges, enslavement and eugeni- uh. Racial modifications. Uplift other species and over time force them to submit to your ethics, modify them as you will.+ Political 'map' in mid to late game reminds one of games such as EVE. Large empires can wage huge wars, federations form and politics can get interesting. On MP, at least. AI is rather lackluster and not very good at that sort of thing. Or staying alive, either.+ Large scale. Number of stars isn't everything, and games like Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion prove as much, but it honestly helps create a sense of awe in space.The Bad+ Ship combat system is incredibly simplistic, in a very bad way. Factors such as range not being used (LRMs will engage in melee like every other ship, for example, instead of staying at their max range) and the complete lack of control over ship orders and priority targets leaves battles completely at the mercy of RNG and your ship compositions. AI isn't very good at countering player navy makeups, if it even tries at all. You can't even tell your fleet to target specific high value targets in a fleet.= Could be fixed by moving the system to something closer to what is in Endless Space, as the combat system does sort of emulate what is used in that game, but is less complex for it lacks difference phases (Long range, medium range, melee and tactics).= Could be fixed by moving the system into something closer to Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion. Different ship types serve a different purpse; LRMs will sit back out of harm's way, whilst corvettes and destroyers armed with lasers and short range kinetics will engage in melee sort of thing. Give commander the ability to pick which targets (individual ships in an engaged fleet) the fleet focuses on, or what certain ships should focus on.= Something between the two could be good, maybe. Really, anything other than what it is now would be better.= Because come on, Star Ruler 2, Endless Space and Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion all do space combat far better. SR2 is made by a tiny (two?) man team in their free time, and is leagues better between the customization system and combat!+ Planet classes only affect two things; when you can colonise it -> The required pre-requisite technology and the resulting habitability (which affects in turn how fast pop grows), which is based on your starting planet class. Then graphics, what the planet 'looks like'.= Some planets, like Tomb worlds, being special planet types are somewhat unique. But even then the differences are far from significant.= Many planets, such as toxic, barren or lava worlds can't even be terraformed in the late game.= Could be fixed by adjusting what sort of resource outputs are given by different classes. Some should give more minerals, others more energy, some more of x or y tech, others biased towards having more space to build but less resources and so on.+ Species and Phenotype don't affect what traits can be picked, only diplomacy. All of them live for the same number of (base) years, which is 60-70 years. No actual advantages or disadvantages to picking one or another. This means, at the end of the day, what you pick only affects the graphics of a pop you see every time you click on a planet, fleet or whatever unless you're dealing with people who've picked xenophobic ethos.= Could be tended to by giving certain races unique traits, more or less slots for trait adjustments, different bases ages (possibly with some randomisation) so tree people and turtle people live longer than a human.+ No trade systems. I mean trade as in trade ships - you can exchange planets, map information, vision, alliances and resources in deals, but you can't exchange the frequently mentioned (by capitalist-style empires) trade agreements.= Would love to be able to build trade stations and would like to watch trade ships move back and forth, even if they are simply sprites for performance reasons. Come on Paradox! Every damn game has this sort of thing in as a default feature, yet you've left it out.+ Ship customization is quite limited. Paradox should take note of Star Ruler 2 and their ship customization system. Not asking for that system exactly, but it is a damn good idea and is very well executed.+ Stale mid to late game. I think they've done a seriously good job at the early game, other than the above problems which only become apparently later in the game and/or through multiple playthroughs. I've got a lot to say as to what could be done, but it is very likely that they have intentionally made these parts stale so to give room for extra $$$ DLC.= At least if the host owns the DLC, all clients get it. They've confirmed it'll still be the case for this game, so there is that, thank paradox.+ Feels quite shallow. I'd say it is quite shallow, for I feel it has less in it than EUIV did on release and many others say it has far less than CK2 did, too.			"

												Notice my hours played.Notice the hours played for many others who give the game thumbs down.I started to write a very long review to describe each aspect of the game and how I feel the Devs dropped the ball - but instead I'll just focus upon what I believe is the most broken part of the game:  Diplomacy.Stellaris uses the same old Diplomacy that pretty much every other 4x game uses - and it's awful.  The system itself is broken and no amount of tinkering is going to fix it.   Either the player is able to predictably benefit from interacting with the other Race, in which case the player will do so, or the player is going to ignore the Diplomacy system - in which case it is nothing more than a bother. For me, Star Ruler 2 is the best Space 4x game to be released so far, and this game adds very little to the genre.  The event system is nice - but they need to add hundreds more events because right now the same handful of events are repeated over and over.  I give Stellaris a thumbs down, even though it's not a horrible game.  Maybe after some more patches/mods/content is released - I'll write a new review, but for now I'd recommend staying away from it.			"

												Paradox pushed this game out the door before it was ready. It plays like an alpha: Placeholder text abounds, the late game events contain several game-ending bugs, and the multiplayer takes some dark sorcery to get working.The game can still be fun and addictive, but it has frustrated me enough that I felt the need to write a review. I wouldn't recommend Stellaris until Paradox actually finishes it. "

Not to mention all the great patches/content that Peradox are putting out on a regular basis. Why does everybody complain about DLC, espacially when its a game you know has potential.We have jobs, support what you like, it takes money to keep an office/facility and staff.If you whant a complete game off the back wait a couple of months(maybe more), but if you dont mind taking a gander at the workshop for some extra content BUY IT NOW.

												editStill not done. Funny to see how this is a completely different game than the one I bought. Keep at it, devs.end editWritten 6/25/16 before version 1.2Like too many games these days. Stellaris is brilliant but far from complete. You can spend hours and hours enjoying this game only to get to a certain point and there's basically a sign up that says ""Sorry, you've run out of game. Come back later when we've finished."" It's a really gross and tricky shell game the devs are playing.It's like if you were to get to the industrial era in CIV and have nothing but future tech to research. At a certain point the only thing you can research is incremental improvements on your already samey-samey weapons and technology,.Another sign that they're not done with this game? An upcoming patch removes an entire feature (embassies) for balance purposes. This is the clearest sign that we are paying to beta test this product. On the one hand  they are making good changes but on the other hand they should have had things like this sorted out prior to me paying full price for it.The good? This game will be GREAT when it's done. I mean that. It's already fun to explore the galaxy and to a lesser extent the tech trees in the early parts of this game. All they need to do is flesh out the mid and late game, and that appears to be the plan. For that reason I'm not entirely infuriated. At least I've contributed to something that will some day pay off. I just hope that comes in the form of more free patches instead of paid DLC.			"

												First of only one problem for me the first three Explore Expand Exploit are well covered, there is room for improvement.                                                                                                                                                        combat there is no control whatsoever once your fleet is engaged, no fleet options except retreat after so many days. Example my fleet engages the enemy Fleet great, then they spy transports behind the enemy fleet so they ignore the fleet thats blasting the snot out of them, and sail right on through the enemy fleet taking terminal damage, on the plus side they do get that lone enemy transport. Also firepower like missiles why do they target one vessel at a time my entire Fleet fires at a corvette huge firepower is lost then another corvette is targeted and again huge firepower is lost, So the moral is that firing rates are now crucial fast rates with low damage are the way to go, missiles with slow rates of reload are at a massive disadvantage, its not how fleet engagements work. A few commands allowing say independant targeting and just targeting one fleet ignoring all others some formation options for the fleet sub groups or battle groups to allow for some tactics. The Combat sucks plain and simple and its one of the 4X exterminate so its a fail on one of the X's.Maybe a algorithm the matches ship fire, each ship in your fleet picks a target any extra ships double up on enemy ships, so every ship is firing at seperate targets, so 30 ships against 30 ships would match up as 30 seperate ship versus ship duels. Then a option that changes that to 2 ships lock onto 1 enemy ship so your thirty ships would fire at only 15 of the enemies ships leaving 15 enemy ships untouched. That at least would give you some tactical optionsSo my Fleet is like a dog without a lead in the park chasing squirrels.  On the other 3X's very solid very engaging room for improvement, one get better fix exterminate.			"

												Opened the game, started a 1200-stars galaxy campaign with my Sporelanders, a peaceful mushroom race who loves slaves. As I discoverd more and more systems, I've met new types of people, I've made so many friends. After 15 hours, I managed to raise a mini empire, with ~12 stars under my command, around 15 allies, with the most loyal ally, my friend, the Gyraphos (A giraffe humanoid) and a few slaves who were treated well and paid enough.But then, I met another spongenoid, who decided that some of my stars were his... so he declared war, and ... 1 year later, I expanded my empire with some additional systems.Little did I know, that after I won that war, my allies started to fear me, started to disrespect The Sporaland and decided to break alliances and start a big war against me. I was so sad, because I've lost so many friends, worked so hard to forge those friendships... but not as hard as those mud-eaters-no-clothes-poor-little-slaves work my mines now, keeping the industry alive, for The Great Western Empire of Sporaland and Their Low-Life-Slaves (containing more than 20 sectors and 180 stars)...Now, after 50 hours... I feel sad... I only have 1 ally, and every empire in the galaxy hates and despites me...  BUT THEY SHALL WORK MY MINES, OR BURN IN THE HELL I'LL LEAVE BEHIND, AFTER I FINISH WITH THEM!!!Love this game, it's everything you'd want: The progeniture resulted from an orgy between Civilization (planetary building, technologies), Spore (Race Customatization), Space Rangers (Spaceships customatization, Space battles) and Crusader Kings (economy, royal family, sectors). Every time you'll start a campaign, it will be an unique experience. "

												The early game where you are slowly unveiling the galaxy for the first time is enjoyable. You're discovering what the game has to offer and thinking ahead about space you want to control. Who will be your allies and enemies?There are problems later in the game, unfortunately. For example, the war system is nonsense. When war begins you are restricted to choosing roughly 3-5 planets that you will take from the enemy (there is a 100 point cost system for your war plan). During the war you can destroy all their armies and land troops onto every one of their worlds, but in the end you can only accept the 3-5 planets you declared initially.This means that you have to declare war multiple times against an enemy to eliminate them. When a war ends you enter a period of peace (a long period) which you must wait to expire before war can be declared again. This is simply tedium because you've already destroyed their army and scooped valuable planets out of their empire.Worse, if you are in a federation (which is how I chose to play) then you can only declare war every 40 or 50 years or so (which is probably a few hours of play, though I have not run a stopwatch on it). During the periods you cannot declare war you're twiddling your thumbs hoping the current federation president accidentally declares the war you want, or that your enemies declare a war against you (though the AI is not likely to declare a war against your superior empire). The system is incompetent.There are numerous bugbears throughout the game that suggest development ended prematurely. For example, you're forced to yield control of planets to the AI, but this AI neglects your citizen's basic need of happiness, giving rise to rebellions (what this game calls ""factions"").The UI is sometimes obtuse and on occasion wildly misleading. You will make several mistakes on this basis. For example, the game mislead me to colonise planets with the wrong species, resulting in them being miserable and rebellious. On top of this, the game offers poor or no solutions to correct the problem. These planets I made mistakes on are likely to be permanently doomed. My only out is to become evil and purge (kill) them, but this would be suicide due to the political ramifications.I hope they can improve and polish these systems with further iterations of this game (patches, DLC, expansions, whatever). In the meantime I think you're better off playing a 4x game that is more mature.			"

Do not buy yet, and wait for at least the next three patches and possibly some DLCs)UI is lackluster, badly designed (forces to repeat too many actions, lacks even basic functionalities of other PDX games like ""separate all units of a class"" or a ""searchable database of discovered planets"")AI is completely idiotic. Will never try ""complex"" manouvers like splitting their fleets in multiple points or attacking more sectors. Just attacks head on, or sometimes sits in a system for ages while their empire is methodically destroyed (not that they mind since it cheats on resources).There are no winning condition except conquest.Mid & late game are extremely boring.Trade & espionage are non existant.Diplomacy is a mess, worse than all other PDX games.Game lacks internal consistency.

												At first you will love this game as much as I did if you are generally into these types of games.Once you get past the initial thrill and the illusion of endless complexity you will hit something called a very stale midgame with hardly any variety and an extremely poorly coded AI that will rip you out of your immersive bubble and show you the game for what it really is. Major mechanics like the AI managing sectors are currently utterly broken. A lot of buttons are purely cosmetical and have no actual purpose at all. Do you want the sectors managed by the AI to focus on mineral production or energy production? Too bad... all the AI does is build farms on your planets anyway, regardless of which option you ultimately choose. Do you want to allow the AI to replace existing buildings on planets? Beautiful... the AI actually razed one of the many unnecessary farms only to replace it with... guess what... Yes! Another farm! Such variety! Such intelligence!I am actually shocked how such a poorly coded AI made it past QA in the first place...Will DLC make this game better?Most definately...But why should I pay for features that were promised to be in the base game to begin with?This new business practice of hastily releasing broken and unfinished games only to be fixed with paid DLC...I for one am sick of it...

												Stellaris is the new game from Paradox, the publisher/developer of such titles as Europa Universalis, Victoria, and Crusader Kings. This review comes from someone with almost 500 hours on EU4, 200 in CK2, and over a thousand in EU3 and Vic2 each (my steam hours are deceiving for those two games).  Now, here are the questions people ask when they first hear about it or want to know about it:Is it as hard as x Paradox game?and Is it like civ?The answers are no and no.Stellaris is a 4x game cleverly disguised as a grand strategy game.Exploration: In the opening stages of the game, you explore using science ships your surrounding systems while finding new planets to colonize and encountering events. This is a typical space 4x mechanic and exists in most other games of the genre. Does this compare to other grand strategy games? Not really. Even EU4's 'search' function in the New World is different. How is this distinct from other 4x games? The events are more varied and better written, and have far more interesting fluff. Colonizing: Colonization is a very simple 'build colony ship, send ship, wait' mechanic, as is similar to other 4x games. Actual land and building development is like a cross between Civilization 4/5 and Galactic Civilizations 2/3. Every planet has different tiles that you build buildings on (each tile giving different static resources or none at all), and you assign pops (citizens) to work each tile as they grow and spawn on the planet over time based on food surplus or migration from other colonies. This is all very standard 4x. There is not much that makes these features very distinct, and it is done in a very standard way.Pops: Now comes the first mechanic that is even vaguely grand strategy: pops and how they function. Every pop individually has four things: a species, ethics, happiness, and ethical divergence. Ethics are a feature in Stellaris that begin based on your Empire's 'governing ethics', and vary from spiritualism to materialism to militarism and pacificm. These are the reigning values that determine a great deal about the paths of tech you will go down to how your pops act and how other empires perceive you. Pops begin with these ethics, but they change over time; as generations are want to do. Ethics: You can do all sorts of things to encourage or discourage this ethical divergence, and whole populations of your original species may become wholly different from your core populations. This mechanic has the most depth of any mechanic in the entire game. In addition to these ethics, you have a couple other tools available to you if you so wish to reign your empire as they require: slavery and purging. Slavery makes pops work better in manual labor tiles such as farming and mining, but work worse in tiles with research and similar things. Purging is literal genocide or xenocide. Want to Imperium of Man your way and purge all xenos? Go for it. I was proud to see Paradox allow that, as they've been historically wary of slavery or genocide, but I guess aliens are less real than the actual slavery that happened in Africa and America (fu paradox don't revisionist history.). However, even if this has the most depth, it still has less depth than the pop system in Vic2.Tech: The other entirely unique feature is the tech system. Tech works by drawing from a 'deck' for 3 (or more with modifiers) cards, which you can pick from to start your next research assignment based on three different research paths that operate parallel to one another. After picking the tech you want to research, the other two(+) go back into the deck to be drawn later. This means you may miss out on a tech for a while if you choose to skip it, making important decisions early on even more pressing. This becomes a lot less interesting in the lategame when most techs are already researched and there's a lot of 'repreated' techs that fill up the lists, so I hope more hard decision techs are added later.FTL: FTL travel has three methods, all three of which are standard 4x tropes. Warp (warp to any system in range, cooldown, warmup, slowish travel time), hyperlanes (can only travel between connected systems, fast, minimal warmup and cooldown) and warp gates (build gates in systems, huge range, very fast, little cooldown, limited by aforementioned built gates). These are very standard and if you've played any other 4x games you know how they work.War: Warfare is standard as well, and the ship designer is a simple slot-based affair where you stick weapons and modules into a design and it spits out damage and armor values on a generic ship model of which there is only one per class. This will most certainly be expanded in an expansion, though I would have liked to see something more indepth such as Galciv's or Star Ruler 2's systems. It has a few different types of weapons that each are countered by different things. This mostly matters in the early game, because lategame weapons rek everything but aren't quite on the level of really late game galciv things.Diplomacy: The game does not have very robust diplomacy. I would say it's even slightly below par with other 4x games; and most certainly extremely below par (triple, quad bogey) with grand strategy games. Almost all of your relations have to do with your ethics and government types rather than logical tactical neccessity or events. Embassies are a boring shallow feature when there is nothing you can really do with it. It seems entirely up to the AI who it wants to ally with, and there's not too much you can do to affect that. And if you go militarist; well, good luck finding allies. Additionally, when you do have an ally, you have to declare war together or not at all. Not being able to declare war on my own is an annoying and backwards restriction. I can understand the restriction in the larger federations, but I should not be locked to the wishes of my ally should I want to venture on something myself. You can easily get around this by offering him a planet, but then simply not giving it to him at the end of the war, since apparently the AI just doesn't care. Exploits.AI: The AI is mediocre or even bad in most cases, though it has that ""perfect micro"" that pdox AI often has where it can snipe things that you would never normally think about just because it can, but when it comes to actually making good decisions it falls on its face. Performance: Performance is okay until the lategame when a lot of things are happening, where it hits the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ really fast. Hopefully this is improved in time.Random Events: My primary complaint is the complete lack of non-surveying events. When you aren't surveying or observing pre-ftl species, there are just very few events that occur randomly and have something to read or think about. This is the sprinkling of grand strat, that even when you're waiting around for things to build, you typically get a steady stream of events to read or do things with, with the occasional big event you really have to deal with or think about. With several of the quest lines being currently broken and the only other long event lines being the end game crises, this is one of the big reasons (as well as the lack of diplomacy as stated above) the midgame is so reportedly BORING. War after war isn't fun, and internal issues are sparse with so few events. We'll certainly hopefully get more with expansions, but that requires them to keep putting more of the grand strat wool over the 4x core rather than submitting to the masses who just want space civ. Overall, it's a solid 4x game, and a refreshing take on a genre (space 4x) that has been stagnant for years. Does it beat DW in complexity? Oh, lord no. Does it beat Galciv in raw gameplay? Not really. Does it beat other grand strats in flavor and atmosphere? No.So what is it? A pretty good 4x game, but a terrible grand strategy game. Maybe it'll be a proper one someday, but not now.:awoo:			"

												So far I have ~11 hours on record and I must admit that I find it a little bit lacking considering it is a Paradox game.Don't get me wrong, it is a fantastic game but it fails to meet the expectations I had on Paradox. The economy is pretty simple and damn, diplomacy too which is kind of disappointing.I hope this is just the skeleton of what can become one of the greatests 4x games.#MakeSpaceGreatAgain			"

												Stellaris is another magnificient grand strategy title from Paradox Development Studio that is incredibly deep, immensely detailed and highly ambitious. The game is also championed by a vastly improved user interface when compared with other Paradox games and has a far more inviting learning curve without losing the challenge or depth that the other games by this highly regarded developer offer.Paradox are widely known for their catalogue of strategy games over the years which are of a very high quality but are also remarkably complex to an extent; some newcomers and even veterans of the genre felt alienated, confused and simply overwhelmed. Stellaris however, has a fully fledged tutorial integrated into the main campaign which not only guides you through the general mechanics along with each feature in a constructive manner; it explains aspects clearly and this is further supported by a far more user friendly interface. The screen is less cluttered when compared with the likes of Europa Universalis IV and all the information is clear, condensed and well presented. The game takes place in space which is an almost Call of Duty style departure from the typical Paradox titles of classic eras and a real world setting. The premise is also slightly different as you create your colony from scratch or by selecting some preset examples instead of guiding an already established country. Your goal in the galaxy is to explore, build, research, expand, conquer and even exterminate all other races you come across - basically exactly what you'd expect from a 4X title. You can play this game however you wish and at your own pace -  you may opt to be a fanatic militarist or simply want to discover as much of the universe as possible whilst befriending and benefitting from other races you meet along the way. It is a massively detailed and highly engrossing experience in which the developers have made the transition from reality to sci-fi in a very credible fashion. Stellaris runs superbly too and is bolstered by truly fantastic atmosphere enhancing audio that compliments your game throughout. The visuals are very good too and the galaxy map whilst despite looking rather basic, is easy to grasp and understand which is another massive plus. Overall; Stellaris is another superb Paradox title that is riddled with depth and a long term challenge but is also presented and executed in a far more appealling and enjoyable way than some previous titles by the studio. This game will have a bright future and is sure to provide many hours of entertainment.			"

FULL VIDEO REVIEW: 


YouTube™ Video: Play Wait or Avoid? Review of Stellaris 

			Views: 20,509		

			Play Wait or Avoid reviews cover the latest indie games, early access games, and AAA titles in a way that doesn't rely on scores.		

PROS:Huge level of customization with 93 species, 15 government types, civilization ethics and civilization traits make for thousands of possible combinations of unique civilizations.Game does an excellent job combining the RTS mechanics with the 4X style of gameplay by keeping the maneuverability and control of an RTS while also the depth of a 4X game.Stellaris provides a massive amount of depth when it comes to potential diplomacy between players. Vassal states, alliances, federations all provide players with the building blocks to build up and break down each other’s empires.CONS:There is no tech tree rather you get 3 semi-random choices of technology which prevents a lot of long term strategy and planning from working. Game suffers from pacing issues as once all the stars are explored there is a lot of waiting around for stuff to finish with nothing to do during times of peace.Primary weapon and defense technologies are very generic, there are some cool weapons you can get from side quests but 75% of the part upgrades are the exact same thing but with slightly higher stats.  SUMMARY:	Stellaris is first and foremost a multiplayer game and my recommendation of Stellaris is only as a multiplayer game. As a single player experience the game is lackluster because there is only so much cooperation you can do with the AI and even then the game tends to stagnate once you have explored the entire region. That’s not to say that the AI is bad, but where the diplomatic and governmental systems shine brightest is when they are being used with and against real players. How much enjoyment you get out of the game will be directly based on if you can get your friends together, team up, and blowing each other out of the galaxy.  EXTRA NOTE: Game was provided by the developer solely for review purposes with no compensation or incentive to give a positive review. If you have any questions or concerns about my journalistic integrity please feel free to ask.			"

												TL;DR: 8/10, buy it.Going strictly by the base game (since no DLC expansions exists as of now):Stellaris is a terrific Grand Strategy game from Paradox. Difficulty and learning curve are easier than Europa Universalis, though this may change when more DLC comes out. The game is very easy to get into, especially if you're familiar with Paradox games. It's in more of a ""fantasy/sci-fi"" environment than their other stuff, so if you're not into that then I'd avoid this. However, if you want to fight aliens, this game is for you.Pros:-Very immersive writing-Strategy is necessary, not just ship spam-Different playstyles supported and encouraged-Both pros and cons to playing tall and wide-Interesting mechanics that make managing a large empire less ""micro-y"" but still challenging-Insanely well-developed early game-Colonizing planets is super fun-Late game crises make steamrolling impossibleCons:-Mid game can get very dull-After a certain size, scientific research becomes practically pointless-""Strategic Resources"" don't feel very important, just kind of nice to have-Sectors lack the depth they demand-Diplomacy is pretty bland for a Paradox gameOverall, I'd give this game a solid 8/10. I'd definitely recommend buying it if you're a Paradox fan or just a GS fan in general.			"

												This may well be the best space strategy game I have ever played.Basically, you take Distant Worlds Universe; take out the annoying features; improve the graphics and accessibility; and add the modding that i would like to have seen in Distant Worlds. And there you have Stellaris: superior to Distant Worlds in almost every respect, except perhaps the private fleet (which may well be moddable).What makes this game really awesome is the moddability. Don't like the decisions made by the designers? Redesign the game to your own liking. Want to play in the Milky Way galaxy? make your own galaxy (or wait for someone else to make it). Stellaris as released is a very enjoyably game, and I would recommend it even without the moddability. But Stellaris is so much more than that: it is essentially a tool for creating a space game that plays exactly the way you want it to. It doesn't get much better than that!			"

												Preordered game and have been playing paradox titles since EU2.The game isn't bad, but unfortunately there is no ""maybe"" button on steam so..It has a promising structure, but at present it's pretty shallow and boring. - Diplomacy is pretty bad: barebones options, AI doesn't react to deals they should accept with their eyes closed. War system is terrible (no cb to declare; autosurrender..don't even gert me started)- AI is very weak. Acts passively, never really a challenge. Allied AI will blob and follow your main fleet regardless of actual strategic situation.- Planet development is basic at best (seen better systems in 10 year old games), espionage non existent, trade (trade routes-commerce) is absent.- Battles are very underwhelming. It's a paradox game I know, but really: weapons come with different ranges, but all battles invariably end up in a chaotic melee. No orders, no behaviour, just blob and pray. Very weak. Land battles were better in Moo2, a 20 year old game. - The resource gathering and starbase construction is very similar to galciv, it's ok but it gets repetitive. And it's not original.- Paradox has a strong tradition of ""historical"" games (real world-historic events). Without this context, I feel this game looses a LOT of appeal and originality. I mean this would be an ok game in its present state if it wasn't by Paradox. If I think that this game has VIctoria 2 as a mommy and CK2 as daddy, it's really a letdown and it doesn't live up to the hype. Of course, there will be (many) DLCs. I personally dislike this marketing strategy (DLC spam) and I think in the long run it will be more negative than positive for gaming in general. TL;DR: would be ok if I wasn't expecting Victoria-Hoi-Ck2 in SPACE. As it is, it's a step back.			"

												So, in the few days that I've had Stellaris, I've played over 30 hours.  For the record, that's a minimum of 6 hours a day since I bought it.  I work a full-time job.  I'm not generally a ""fan"" of anything, and I don't have a particularly addictive personality.  All that should tell you how rapidly addicting this game can be for those who are fans of the genre.As for those who aren't typically 4x strat gamers, this game still has a great deal to offer.  You might be better off starting with the new MoO reboot, but honestly, Stellaris is not inaccessible for new players.  For all its complexity and variety (to be greatly expanded in the upcoming Heinlein update), it's organized simply and largely intuitively.  Ironically, it's more difficult for experienced 4x gamers, than for those new to the genre, I think.Now, for WHY it's worth a recommendation...++ There's always something to do: As a real-time game that can be paused (and accelerated), you're always active in managing your empire, and rarely waiting for things to happen for any significant length of time.  And the pause feature means that if you need a moment to assess the situation and devise a solution, you've got it, no matter what.  It's really amazing once you compare games, just how rare that quality is in 4x games.  Anyone who's spent turn after turn waiting for something to happen just so you can do something and spend more turns waiting...fully understands.++ Everything about it moves the 4x genre forward: Even with its flaws (because no game is flawless anyway), every aspect of it is a step in the right direction. The mechanics, the organization, the overall balancing...all of it.  The AI is better than practically any other 4x game, consistently making reasonable decisions (though not yet frequently the best decisions) based on the circumstances of the game at any given moment.  Note: there are complaints about how the AI handles certain situations, and most of those complaints are about to be addressed in the next update, but they mostly center on the game's diplomacy, and the issue isn't the AI, or even really the diplomacy system, it's more an unreasonable expectation by players that the AI should take a trade deal that the player themselves wouldn't accept if the roles were reversed (keep in mind also, that they will never admit that, but it's true without exception).  Ultimately, my feeling is that every aspect of the game has helped to improve 4x games overall.  There's too much fixation on new features and mechanics, when what matters is the quality of what there already is.++ All strategies are valid: You'll hear a lot about how you have to play a certain way to get anywhere, and that's largely because of the aforementioned diplomacy issue.  The reality is, with a little care and creativity, you can make almost anything work.  If you think outside the box, however, be aware that there are risks and that there will be consequences.  A good example of this is that the game almost directly prohibits ""colony-rushing"" on the scale that most games demand.  You could, however, still do it, even within the constraints of the game...but it'll cost you.  Still, it's a valid strategy, it's just not OP anymore.  I'm biased, but I've always hated colony-rushing.  It feels so unrealistic and just takes me completely out of the experience.But nothing's perfect, and here are some things you should know before you make your decision.- It does have flaws: Most of the bugs have been worked out, but some do still exist; and there are also remaining balance and gameplay issues that, while not game-breaking by any measure, are something to be aware of.  As expressed before, many of these are being addressed in the coming update, and any after that will be handled accordingly.  New patches often bring new bugs, but the hotfixes so far have taken care of those in short order each time.- It lacks a truly creative ship designer: Galactic Civilizations II and III have one of the most flexible and detailed ship designers in all of 4x gaming.  It's always been one of my favorite features of those games (my ONLY enjoyable feature for III), and Stellaris would've been an excellent opportunity to include even a much simpler version of such a designer.  What we got is more than enough for the purposes of the game; but I like to make unique ships and to get creative with it, and not having it does count against the game, for me.- Lack of overall ship variety: The game has three modes of space travel, and since each xenotype has its own style of ship, it was a perfect opportunity to create three styles of ship for each xenotype, one for each of the three modes of travel.  It's hardly a major issue, but I enjoy depth and detail, and it would've added so much to the look and feel of the game, for not a terrible amount of effort, I'd think.  The option to alter the color schemes of ships, also, would've been good.  Always brings me down a bit when I run across ""alien"" empires with identical ships to my own.- Like most of its games, you have to log in with a Paradox Account to be able to do certain things.  It's not something I'm a fan of, but the game is good enough that I'll tolerate it.  But keep it in mind if that kind of thing is a dealbreaker for you.And that's it...I say, get the game if 4x is your cup of tea.  Odds are, you won't regret it as long as you assess it on its own merits, rather than how it compares to other such games.			"

												The thumbs down is only for the game at the moment of my last played game (5/29/2016)(Pre-Clark Update) this does not mean the game won't get better with time as it most likely will if it follows the usual paradox dlc strategy. (The review will be updated in a years time after the 1st dlc arrives) After playing for a little over a hundred hours I think I've seen enough to give a fair opinion. The game is a bare bones 4x(if you can even call it that). +A variety of special events and lore activities like the ones in CK2 and EU4+Looks beautiful especially the space battles best looking paradox game to date! +Nothing more satisfying than looking at that cool ARC emitter you spent years researching blasting the face off of that that enemy battle ship at long range. And that there is pretty much where the praises end:-Diplomacy is so lacking it's pathetic and there's only 2 war options liberate and cede planet.-AI is bad all around especially when it comes to sectors.-Sectors are just a black hole where you dump planets and forget about them. They have NO events to speak of.-Needs more events! You'll see some events more than a dozen times throughout a single game. -Lot's of broken events (Pre Clark Update). I've had an asteroid impact event in my game for well over 200 years after I had already destroyed the thing.-Only 3 late game crisis and their all horde mode. Horde's that the other AI empires wouldn't even attack(Pre-Clark Patch). You would be the only empire in the galaxy fighting against absolute doomsday and everybody else just sits around declaring war on other AI empires or doing nothing.-NO ECONOMY so bad it's almost a joke. Trade is done pretty half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥but you can expect either paradox to add it in as a free update or charge you money for it in dlc form.---ADVERTISED AS A 4X GAME YET IT'S MORE LIKE 3X! The devs are actively trying to limit expansion for their own reasons. Beware of this fact if you like expanding fast in your strategy games.-Mid to late game will get ULTRA boring at times since it take's forever to research tech if your a big empire and there's really not too many events left at that point. -Lagging in mid to late game-Who's bright idea is it to keep shoving unneeded EU4 land based mechanics into a ""4x"" space game? It doesn't work well in a space setting. Again all of this was before the Clark update and I know quite a bit was changed I'm writing this late review for when I finished my last play though off it. The biggest thing that stuck out to me was that instead of fixing  things in the game like lag, events, and sectors they instead focused on nerfing and hindering player strategies to force them to play the game paradox invisioned it to be played instead of letting players do their own thing.At this moment the game is beautiful but half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in many places and made bare bones so they can sell dlc later on to patch it up. Something I don't take to to kindly too.5/10. Has massive potential but it just isn't there yet. Buy at your own risk for now but definitely keep an eye out for this one.			"

												I've finally played enough of this game to feel comfortable writing a review. To start off, I'm a huge Paradox fan. EU4 is in my top 2 games of all time, and I love Crusader Kings, Vicky II, Cities, and Hearts of Iron. I think EU4 is about as perfect as you can get in terms of Grand Strategy - for reference, I think Civ IV is about as close you can get to perfect in 4X territory. Stellaris comes close to being great in both categories, with a lot of interesting mechanics and events, but manages to fall short in both, making it a kind of jack-of-all-trades game, master of none.To reiterate, in its current state (1.4.1 I believe), Stellaris is almost a great game. It has a lot of potential, which is not something most want to hear when they buy a finished game, but Paradox has shown that they are looking to support games for years down the line. This is hopeful, because I think it will be like EU4 - shaky at first, but amazing later. That being said, usually this also comes with a load of DLC, but as long as they don't pull a Common Sense or Art of War and basically require you to spend money to get the full value out of the free features, I think it's a decent business model. At least they don't have Season Passes. Now for the Pros of Stellaris - • The pre-game and early game are a lot of fun. They've added a ton of features for universe customization, a fair amount of features for species creation, and there are a lot of mixes of governments and ethics you can go with. As for when you get into the game, it feels like Civ when you start out - you're doing basically the same thing each time, but it still manages to feel new and refreshing as you continue on.• The events are fantastic. I love reading them, and it feels like they've packed a lot in here. Even when I see repeat events, I still read the text, it feels like a compelling story. And best of all, I feel like they do a decent job of having events drive gameplay decisions, kind of like in CK2. • I like a lot of the gameplay mechanics, mainly the ones that deal with the POPs. I find the POP management, building, migration, slavery, robots, occupation, ethics, edicts, and government mechanics all really fun to play around with.• The late game crises are fantastic, a great touch to the game. They really make great stories, which is one of the best things about 4X games. Being able to recount a story later about how you fought off extradimensional invaders is one of the most appealing things about getting to the late game.• Like most Grand Strategy games, it's fun to zone out to for a couple hours after work, or play on the weekend. One of my biggest problems with 4X games is that they sometimes feel too contained - I feel like I need to finish a game of them at once. The biggest appeal of Grand Strategy, to me, is that I can invest as much or as little time into and still feel like I got the same gameplay experience. Now the Cons - • Biggest con by far is that there are far too many mechanics in this game, none of which are particularily fleshed out. This works for Grand Strategy games, where you can automate a lot of stuff and just focus on a few more pressing gameplay concerns (like trade in EU4, or everything in Vic II). Stellaris has a lot of great IDEAS for mechanics, where I feel like they just need some patches to get right. But here's just a laundry list of mechanics that aren't at all fleshed out - factions, terraforming, government, enlightenment, vassalage, protectorates, fallen empires, federations, alliances, anything to do with technology, anything to do with sectors, anything to do with ships, anything to do with armies, and trait modification all need a lot of work.• The other problem, past having WAYYYY too many game mechanics, is that none of them affect the game that much. If you want to, you can ignore things like ethics, factions, and pop development completely, which are (supposedly) things Paradox put a lot of time into in this game.• Something that might not bother other people, but actually destroys the game for me, is the lack of any interesting in-game analysis ability. I'm talking about having minimal maps, no ledger, no good search ability, and no empire history. Add this stuff, Paradox! It makes your games so much more interesting when I can look at 20 different map modes and learn about the world. • The UI sucks in this game. Absolutely atrocious. There are too many menus, they contain too little information on each menu, there isn't an easy way to initiate diplomacy, you have to click too many times to do things, it is not obvious where specific things are in the UI (even to someone who's played 60 or so hours), there isn't enough info displayed in the banners at the top of the screen, and there is FAR too much information displayed in the sidebar. All of these are relatively easy fixes for Paradox, especially since they have good UI in their other games - this is a real problem that it sucks in its current state. • This isn't a new complaint for many 4X games, but the diplomacy needs work. There isn't much you can do with it and you can't automate it if you want the most out of it, which is the worst combination.As I said before, Stellaris is almost great, but it falls short sooo hard that I can't recommend it in its current state. There are just too many things that aren't fleshed out or just aren't finished. Wait for a few more patches, maybe some DLC, and then a year or two down the line it will probably be great. But until then, I would say hold off.Sorry Paradox. I still love you! Keep doing what you're doing.			"

												Stellaris is a great game but unfortunately is made by paradox interactive, which means that even though it has a good idea and decent execution half the content that should be in the game will be cut out and sold to you as DLC. If you want to see what stellaris could potentially end up being, take a look at crusader king 2's current DLC list.The DLC is good, but it's still more money you have to pay. The base game, in my opinion, is not worth playing without DLC.The free updates have really helped this game, however. At first the game was literally half done- the first 2-3 hours of each game was amazing and the end was climactic, but the middle was just putting the game on 3 times speed and occasionally clicking the research tab while everything plays itself. It slowly has begun to pace itself better and better, but to get an actually fun and engaging (mildly, because things are still missing) experience you need to be ready to put down another additional 30 dollars which will likely turn into 50-100 over the course of this game's lifespan.The game even adds feature creep with each DLC that seems halfassed. For example, hiveminds are a playable race that pretty much remove half of the mechanics of the game with nothing really added to compensate. You might say that this is a good tutorial kind of race to play then, but A) their playstyle is sort of unorthodox because of these removed things so you're not actually learning to play the game properly, and B) it's a DLC perk so if this statement is true you're essentially paying 20 dollars for a tutorial. Sure you can get gene-modding as a hivemind and start doing interesting things other races can't, but usually this happens so late in the game you've already eliminated pretty much every other race so it's pretty much pointless. The perk trees end up adding some depth in utopia, but they aren't really fixing or paving over half baked ideas, just adding new sort of less half baked ideas on top of everything. This isn't a review of the DLC though. But I thought I should put those out there as examples. The main problems with the base game are combat and diplomacy. The trade system used to be terrible, now it's just kind of bad. It's pretty standard for other 4X games, but it could be a lot better. You just jostle things around until the AI finally accepts through you manipulating the fact that it's a computer. The combat seems very well designed with a good rock paper scissors style battle system, but in reality you can just spam corvettes with kinetic weapons. This is due to the fact that upkeep is based on the cost of the vehicle, so even if you go way over fleet capacity you can just keep churning them out and overwhelm any opponent. The AI is also faulty, you can just split up your fleets and spin them around the enemy and they'll switch targets so much you'll half your expected casualties.Now look. Paradox games are usually not really about perfect gameplay and combat, more about roleplay and having fun situations. But the problem is that the roleplay isn't very deep in this game- it feels like no matter what you're going for in each different game you end up getting funneled into the same path. Not only this, but some playstyles are so bad due to the mechanics of the game that you can't even have fun playing scenarios with them. I try to get into roleplaying my faction but it always ends up being the same old crap and abusing the AI to stop them from immediately infringing on my territory with twice the power I could have possibly gotten due to random tech.I recommend this game, but not for the price of the game + all the DLC. This review is mostly criticism, but these are just the things I wanted to bring up. It's very well polished, very addicting, and has some absolutely brilliant ideas. It's just a shame that it feels gutted without paying additional money to add more gutted content. Maybe sometime down the road a bunch of dlc will finally fix everything and way later after that the entire pack will be sold for 50 dollars, but until then I can only really offer a ""ho-hum"" recommendation.EDIT: I forgot to mention something that annoys me the most about this game: the balance between ""tall"" vs ""wide"". If you're new to 4X, essentially tall means you have few cities/planets/etc that are absolutely massive in production/science and wide means almost all of your cities are crap but you just keep churning them out and take over neighbours so it ends up evening out. Tall is absolutely useless in this game. In other 4X games there is a bonus to going tall, in CIV you get a culture and science bonus compared to other civs, etc. Tall gets bonuses in stellaris, but at the very end of the game. By the time you get megacities or ring worlds, the game's fate has already been decided, and likely you're going to lose. You have such a disadvantage at the start of the game and it's not made up for by the amount you gain at the end. I hate playing wide because there's a lot of micromanagement and I'm not really a warmonger, so it's really bothersome that my favourite playstyle just lets me get run over by other civs.			"

												Stellaris has a really great and fun early game, but really boring and clunky mid/late game due to lack of tools to easily manage your growing empire. For example, it's really hard to tell what's happening in your planets when you grow your empire. Late game I also found bugs that required a prompt command to fix.I really want to like it, but Paradox really dropped the ball on this one. You see, it's not unfixable, not at all. I just hope those ""fixes"" don't come in the form of paid DLCs. Update: It seems like they are aware of those concerns and promised in their letter to the community they'd fix them in a timely manner.			"

												So disappointing.The AI cheats - you can't for instance make them run out of energy. Even a single planet without any stations can support an infinitely large fleet, which isn't fun if your fleets are the same size + they have a spaceport.War declarations are stupid in this game. You can only declare on planets they have settled, which are very often not the ones you want. You want ones that suit your race. But you can't declare for an unsettled system. You have to take a system that they have settled, even if you don't want it.Combat's pretty bad. The AI is exploitably stupid. send a single warship from the other direction, their fleet leaves the planet, you can wipe out the spaceport and then the fleet separately. Which is the only way I've found of beating cheating AIs - see above. You also can't tell your ships - hey stay inside the aura of this defense station - it's actually what's going to win this fight. Or to retreat without leaving the system. I just wanted them to back up a bit - why get in range of the stations if you don't have to?As for the RPS system of lasers/shields etc. That's great and all. But in order to find out what your opponent uses... you need to invade. Hooray. No espionage in the game, nor are they likely to venture into range of your scanners with their fleet. Good luck building that fleet after your war dec.Forget getting the AI to make a deal either. Seems like even just to trade charts you'll need to send them more than a far share to get a deal passed. The diplomacy of EU4 is gone. Replaced with the braindead ""why is this even in the game"" diplomacy of Civ5:BE. It also happens between two screens you'll need to keep changing between endlessly. Yeah, embassies and alliances happen in this screen, but trades and pacts happen in this other screen. No you can't exchange for systems that aren't settled (i.e. useful ones) and if you could, I don't doubt the AI would never agree. There's simply no tools to handle relations with other relations, nor are there the nice and transparent summary screens of EU4. You get embassies and rivals. That's never enough.And the ♥♥♥♥ing primitive planets. There's no way for a xenophobic race to deal with them. I just want them gone. But no diplomacy with them to wage war against them...♥♥♥♥♥♥ You have four ♥♥♥♥♥♥ options, and they become a ticking time bomb. If they become a vassal they instantly take all the nearby systems with them. Even if the system they were in had a frontier station. Great - guess I'll wage war against them in ... 10 years. Even if the race is some screwed up ""kill all other species"" race. No Paradox, I get to kill them now.Also, there seems to be no way of ignoring peace deals. I'm waging war just to destroy all life on their planets, and they end up giving them to me... I don't want that. I declared war to empty their planets, so I can move in. If I'm not a race that can purge - what is my recourse then? You can't deal with these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ planets of other races - the tools for integration amount to an endless spending of your points to keep a faction happy. And slaves suck. Oh boy do they suck. 50% production? What? So they can starve?Also, the tech drafting can ruin your game. You want to colonise? Guess it hasn't come up yet. You need bigger ships or better weapons because yours are out of date? Screw you, research one of these instead.I don't really want to play this game anymore. Frankly. I appreciate some of the grind has been taken away from games like MoO, of managing planets and so on. But that comes back the moment building stations on multiple systems becomes tedious. It's also all the game really is. Exploration. Expansion dies off so quickly, there's no reason to fight other civs, because what you'll get you won't want. Stellaris is a 1X game at best. Because the other 3X's it falls down at, so hard. It's not grand strategy either. Not in the slightest.If there was a faster speed than fastest I certainly would have been using it. In the end it's just as shallow as the new MoO is. Event chains certainly don't save it.These are fundamental problems, and maybe DLC will fix them (cynically I think that may have been paradox's plan from day one) but it will be a long time coming.

												This game is wonderful!  Firstly, creating your own custom race and empire is one of the best parts of the game.  You choose everything from what type of species you are, what sort of planet you came from, your ethics and government, visuals, and starting weapon systems (guns, missles, or lasers), and even method of FTL travel.     There are 3 options.  Standard warp, slow but non-restrictive, hyperspace, fast but dependent on naturally occuring hyperspace ""lanes"" or Wormhole gates, instant travel to or from a system within range of a warpgate. One of the more unique choices i've seen in a space 4x game.  The game even reacts quite well to your choices when it comes to your empire's ethics and government types.  Dialogue boxes will change to reflect your empires outlook on alien lifeforms and the cosmos in general.     You start off just after your first FTL capable ships are created and the whole galaxy is a mystery, your first task is scanning all the objects in your home system that until now your species as only gazed at through telescopes.  You'll find strange anomolies that spawn research projects and discover wonderous new worlds.  The early game perfectly captures the feeling of curiosity and exploration.  As you progress you may encounter primitive civilizations that you can subjagate or silently observe in the hopes of one day uplifting them.  You'll obviously also encounter other empires with which you must either befriend or make your foe.     The war system on this game is also quite unique, at the start of a war you declare what you want to get out of it.  If you are scary enough you might be able to get them to just give you a planet to avoid a war.  If a war does start the game keeps track of battles won and lost and give you a war score that will affect how much you can demand at the peace talks should you choose to negotiate an end to the hostilities.  The better your score the more likely you are to get a favorably lopsided peace deal.       Being that the game only released today i have not gotten much father than my first real war with another empire, which I won and I forced him to become my vassal.  But it is amazing how many options you have to deal with other empires.   You can create an embassy which will slowly make them like you over time or declare them a rival which makes them dislike you greatly but you gain influence points which you spend on things like frontier outposts to expand your borders or on Edicts (essentially passive bonuses to your empire that cost continual influence upkeep).     Graphically the game is gorgeous.  I often find myself just roaming my systems staring at the strange or beatiful worlds I encounter.     All in all if you are a Sci-fi fan, or a fan of 4x games your gonna wanna check this out.  If you like Sci-fi AND 4X games this game is a MUST HAVE.     If your new to the 4X genre the game might be a bit overwhelming as there can be a lot of micromanaging.  However the game has a great tutorial system that explains the game as you go without getting in the way too much.  Also there are a few ways to automate management on certain things if you hate micromanagement.     I'm not sure if I've played it enough to give it a X/10 number yet but I played it non-stop since release today and never felt bored or frustrated.  It has excellent pacing and is the most enjoyable 4x game i've played in a while.  It does a great job of making the galaxy feel vibrant and alive.  Honestly I can't recommend this game enough.  Buy it, Play it, you'll have a great time!			"

In an era when classic 4x and other strategy titles can be picked up for £5, I was stubbornly wary of parting with my cash, caught between a mixed bag of reviews. But then I had a beer, and I made the leap. Being so cynical, yet having enjoyed my time with this game so much, I’ve taken the time to write my own review which will hopefully help someone somewhere to make up their mind, one day.  Maybe.Who I am (where I'm coming from):A nostalgic and tight fisted SMAC[1] head who pines after hard sci-fi, immersive storytelling and believable AI, living stubbornly in the illusion that programming these things ‘surely can’t be that hard, they’re just being lazy.’ I think low bandwidth Natural Selection[2] 1.0 three hour epics were the high water mark of western civilisation. Or at the very least were damn good fun.-------------------------------------------The Short, (the summary), buyers guide – Quick(ish) answer to the question “should I fork out £30ish for this game, right now, in this economic climate and these end times, where moments have never been so precious now there’s a tortilla bashing maniac with his finger on the button?”In a word, Yes. Here’s why I think what I think.This game is an excellent and immersive strategy title that tells a story. There is a strong role playing element and while an imagination is essential to making the most of your time playing it, you’ll still enjoy the game if you want to just switch off and burn every living thing in the galaxy, or turn it into a pretty spreadsheet. Stellaris throws a seemingly endless narrative of events, graphics and quirks your way, and while it doesn’t have the complexities of some of Paradox’s other titles, this is a deep and engaging strategy experience.But… it isn’t just a pretty space challenge; it’s also a lot of fun. So much fun, I haven’t been tempted to hollow it out through min maxxing my way through it, which given my robotic tendencies, is possibly a first (It also made me question why I continued playing so many other, vaguely similar titles beyond the point at which they ceased being ‘fun’).Be a race of xenophobic space mushrooms, purging the galaxy on an interstellar religious crusade. Be the fanatic scientists, unlocking the secrets of creation to hasten the evolution of their species only to doom an entire galaxy with their hubris. Be the shrewd peace loving diplomats, slowly manipulating their way into becoming an economic power house.This is an immersive, fun and complex (enough) strategy game that is more than worth it right now (do get the leviathans expansion however– essential reading). Stellaris feels like a gem to me. A slightly polished gem too. It has plenty of issues and room for improvement (more on this in the long review), but far from making me feel short changed, I can see it has an exciting future. The team are dedicated and work hard, consistently producing beautiful things. They are involved with the community, responding to sensible feedback and requests, as well as not so sensible feedback.To say this is a perfect game is absurd. And I’m definitely guilty of looking back on my gaming past with rose-tinted-to-the-point-of-being-deluded-kaleidoscope goggles.But…If you like 4x or anything sci-fi this is a no brainer. If you’re new to these concepts then this is a fantastic experience, and suitable for anyone who’s ever logged into a COD server with chat enabled and wished the sun would implode while there’s still time to eradicate us permanently. For an in-depth (long) account that covers topics such as performance issues and what the game actually feels/looks like, see my lengthy diatribe through the link below:https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellaris/comments/5oxdey/stellaris_review/ "

												OLD OUTDATEDTHIS IS A GOOD GAME (with a lot of potential) I will put a negative review for the moment, concerning (at least for me) this problem/issue.Ok...what the is the point of a ""peace"" faction? What did the developers have in mind, regarding them? Domination and Concuest victories is the only ones available. And Fedrations whilst you are united, doesn't add anything at all to the progress.One ally and my vassals would have been enough anyway.So what should I do ? What do they want me to do? Yea well ok. I understand you would gain a lot of planets that way as a federation. But the AI can create Federations too so.Should I just vassalize everyone and integrate them at a huge price? As a pacifist nation I really don't want a -10 or -20% happiness penalty all the time.But that's not all. The pacifist food bonus is mediocre and only helps you very early in the game. A peaceful nation has no point really. Nor a Federation, at least as a pacifist nation.I don't know how I feel about this, the game is basically limiting itself to one way of playing. It could be so much more. (as a core game not 5 DLCs in) And the war score system... Jesus christ Paradox.


Sigh, what in the holy ♥♥♥♥ing hell is this?

												This is one of the best purchases I've ever made. The amount of content is unbelievable. Honestly anyone who is a fan of Civ V like I am or any type of strategy games must try this game out. There are a few annoying things about this game, like almost never being able to fight someone if you choose a certain philosophy, but that sort of makes sense. I'm not a huge gamer and this is the first review I've ever done, but I did so only to bring awareness to this amazing game, however small the difference I make. I hope more people enjoy this game like I have.			"

												Stellaris looks and feels like a proper, complex and diverse game of galactic conquest. You got a lot of options and races, you can research, colonize and conduct diplomacy like in any other installation of 4X in Space. Stellaris has great music and  a pretty neat art design.But Stellaris in all its features is as well an incredible limited game. While it takes a while to realize that and you will have some fun until then, it becomes very clear after some attempts that Stellaris is about one thing only. Building a fleet that is bigger than your neighbours. Whatever you do, whatever your grand strategy is or your philosophy. Wether you want to be peaceful, warlusty or both is of no consequence. If your fleet is small, you get attacked and overrun. If your fleet is big, you steamroll the map. Thats it.			"

												TL;DR: Get the game. You wouldn't even be here reading reviews if you don't like space 4x games, and this is a great 4x gameGalaxy and FactionsFirst of all you start in a galaxy of a maximum of 1000 stars(there are mods to play even more stars). planets/asteroids,etc are in orbit around stars, which adds a nice immersion, Factions are randomly generated every game, instead of the same old prebuilt factions that you have in other 4x games, although you can build your own factions to spawn in the galaxy if you wish do to so. and there's lots and lots of different variable options so that you basically will never meet the same faction twice, huge number of government types, ideas, culture, races, ship types, FTL types, etc. Faction customization is great, It's like every possible faction personality is available to create. you can even customize the random names the factions give to their people, ships, fleets, armies, planets, stars, etc.Tons of events are happening in the galaxy as well, giving it more personality and flavor, sometimes the game gives you quest-like missions where you have to study this wreckage, then it will lead to another points of interests, leading to new techs, bonuses, etc.Empire/GovernmentEmpire management is awesome, you can actually select your type of government(and change it in-game) resulting in different types of bonuses and government systems. You can have a democracy where there's an election every 5 years, 50 years, or a dictatorship, empire, religion-based faction, science-lead faction, etc, etc. Each elected leader has different personalities as well, with different aims, platforms, etc. Some ruler will want to bring back slavery to your empire when elected for example. Rulers are picked from a pool of leaders, basically your admirals, generals, researchers, and governors in your empire, and they have different agendas if they get elected as leader, Support the one you like the most. Factions can also form up inside your empire if your population's culture and beliefs become more and more varied. Some people may like the current government, some people may want changes or reforms.The population system is also well-made. You can actually play as a non-genocidal xenophilic type, where every race(or certain races only, it's up to you) is welcome to your empire. again, unlike other 4x games where it's you or them. You can have an empire composing of many different races, a pan-species empire. and they can have different privileges, like giving them rights to vote, to move freely, etc. You can be as racist as you like or as welcoming as you like. or both! welcome them, and then exterminate them! Your choice. You can even genetically manipulate your own species, or other races, or create robots, androids, or genetically enhanced soldiers, some races might be better soldiers than others, use them as such.DiplomacySome would say the diplomacy is lacking compared to other games, but I beg to differ. There's lots of things to do in the diplomacy side. First of all, FEDERATIONS, you can actually form federations with different factions, not just alliances, but federations, you elect a federation president every few years and rotate around the different members, the federation also has their own shared federation fleet, comprising of technology taken from all the members. It's similar to GalCiv's United Planets but you aren't forced to join and it's not automatically created for everyone, even enemy factions. Lots of different treaties like star chart sharing, non-aggression treaties, embassies, research ventures, and good ol' resource trading. There's no traditional 'trade lines' trading like in galciv though. You can make a faction your vassal, and there are multiple types, you can even play as vassal to another empire and eventually liberate yourself from it if you want to. you can also integrate them into your empire.One more awesome thing is you can actually see primitive civilizations in game!, and they all vary and you can see them in different states, whether they are in the early space age, bronze age, industrial, etc. or you might even see a dead world where a past civilization blew themselves up due to nuclear war. If you are playing as non-humans, you might even see our own Solar System!, maybe we blew ourselves up? maybe you just arrived in time before we do? or you arrived during our cavemen days and chose to observe us instead? You can observe them, advance their technology, abduct them for experiments or even uplift them, or invade and exterminate them.ResourcesResources system is well made, you mine minerals from planets, asteroids, either from orbit, or if you have the planet colonized, on the ground. You need minerals basically for everything that you construct. You can construct power plants, in lots of different ways in order to get Energy Credits, which is the main currency of the game. You also have three research resources: Society, Engineering and Physics, and different celestial bodies give bonuses to them when an orbital station or facility is constructed. You also gain influence points to use on diplomacy or actions related to your empire/faction/government.Research and TechnologyYou also can have three researches going on in parallel, which is Society, Engineering and Physics, which is much more immersive as well. no more having to decide whether to research for your colony infrastructure first or for your military strength, etc. Technology is smartly randomized every time you finish a research, meaning, there is no fixed research tree, you get the immersion of really researching stuff, as you won't know what technology lies far ahead.WarfareSpace Warfare is similar to your usual Space RTS games, with the good addition of Turn Based like status reports, where you can see statistics of the battle while it is going on, there is also land warfare in which you can create and recruit armies and invade planets to finally colonize them, you can also get air support from your ships in orbit and bombard the planet however way you want.Thoughts about the gameGreat game, huge great potential to become one of the best space 4x games ever made after more content is made(DLCs, expansions) I'm not saying it's lacking content though, it's got more than enough to keep you playing. My expectations on this game was not that high considering all other recent 4X games have been 'meh' for me, and I haven't really played any Paradox Interactive games that much. It's already better than most if not all other 4x games out there, and it's only going to get better with time.Score: 9.7/10As of writing this, it's 94% positive right now on steam reviews. worth the price.

												Does lack certain mechanics typical for 4x games, i.e. spying, sharing food between planets; proper info about scouted territory (i.e. list of colonisible planets). That said, this is one of the best games I played lately, and it only gets better with upcoming patches! I really enjoyed blend of 4x in early game and grand strategy in the late.Edit: There seems to be a some movement to the right direction in the new patches (i.e. 1.3). So some of the the criticisms above will soon no longer be valid.			"

												If you like 4X games, this one will become one of your favorites.  The game is an excellent 4X game with many Grand strategy elements. And a few surprises to keep you on your toes.Admittedly the game still has some issues regarding balance and bugs, but nothing game breaking.The possibilities given by the race creation screen give the game the ability to feel fresh for a long time and through multiple plays.The randomized tech tree, puts powergamers at a difficult spot, but on the same time for someone who is not trying to find the optimal way to beat the game, is a refreshing (and most welcomed) change for a 4X game.

												I'll tell you he story of the Bisnarth race, my flying monkeys and their friends the Humans and goat people. Two of my friends and I decided that forming an alliance to take over the galaxy was a foolproof way of *winning* and that it would simply be a matter of how long it took.WELL.A pretty easy start and several wars later, 3 AI species made an alliance and challenged us. They hadn't done anything else all game so we were surprised by their sudden hostility, and their 9K stacks of fleets also didn't come across too friendly. In the end of the great space wars, only one of the 3 remained and asked to join our alliance. We decided to allow it, then finding that he immediately left. We were confused by this and saw that he had:1: joined our alliance and had a peace treaty of 30 years applied to joining between all of our empires.2: insulted one of the Fallen empires nearby so that they would lose their opinion of US. 3: watch as we were dismantled by scarab ancestors who only sought to humiliate us.Also, a ceramic pot gave us divine inflection and led us to further warp drive capabilities.10/10 would play again			"

												Great game. Well thought out with lots of nice little touches. In case anyone is wondering like I was:Single player can be played fully off-line.Single player games are fully pausible - I haven't played multiplayer.Single player games can be saved locally or to cloud.Game pad controllers are irrelevant. I play 99% with a mouse only but for those who like keyboard shortcuts there are plenty available.Good graphics - though I don't know where the video clips from the ads are from - Edit: found it, I hadn't looked hard enough, my bad.Initially I couldn't decide between Stellaris and No Mans Sky but talking to freinds and from my own experience Stellaris is WAY the right choice.EDITOver 100 hours now still on my first game and still lovin' it. The more you play the more you can appreciate the great lengths the developers have gone to to include so much detail, its incredible. There are so many inter-related aspects of the game-play, so many things to balance and there is no ""right way"" to run your empire. Every strategy has pros and cons....just like in real life politics.			"

												After not playing for several months, I recently decided to return to the game with the release of Utopia. However, if you want a more comprehensive review of Utopia, I would suggest reading the reviews on its own page. Suffice it to say that it greatly expands on Stellaris's initially lacking late game, and if you do chose to buy Stellaris, I would highly recommend you also purchase Utopia. Regardless of the new content that the various DLC's bring to the game, Stellaris remains let down by its one major flaw: War.Victory in Stellaris comes down to one thing, and one thing alone: the size of your military. You could create a race of pacifist bird-people, as an expample of Stellaris's impressive scope for diversity, but you'll probably end up conquered almost immediately. What about a race of reptilian scientists, deades ahead of the rest of the galaxy? Sure thing! But watch your back, if someone with a bigger navy comes rolling into town, you're probably not going to stand a chance! What about a humble democracy of Humans? You could do that too, but have fun getting penned in! From my 135 hours spent in-game, at least at the times of this writting, the only way I've found to not only rule the galaxy, but merely to survive in it as a sovereign state, is to play as a militaristic conqueror - or as a Hive Mind, one of the new forms of government added in the Utopia expansion.I would have no problem with this, as both EU and HOI are two of my personal favorite grand strategy franchises at the moment, and both are built around the concept of military conquest. However, war in Stellaris is much less nuanced and, frankly, over simplified than it is in either of those aforementioned games. As hinted at above, it comes down to ""He who has the biggest fleet wins."" ""So why not just build more ships?"" you ask. Well, let me tell you: the number of ships you can have in your navy at any one time is limited. It can, however, be increased by constructing orbital space stations around your colonized worlds, or through various technologies. The key then becomes colonizing worlds faster than your opponents, something easier said than done, given that colonization, at least in the early game, is a massive drain on your exonomy.  Therefore, a balance must be struck durring the early game and maintained throughout the rest of the game: on one hand you must expand your empire, witch is expensive, and in the mid to late game - when most of the galaxy has already been claimed by one empire or another - requires and impressive navy. You must also invest in science facilities on planets, along side research stations in orbit, to ensure your technological supremacy. Not to mention power generation facilities - the main currency in Stellaris is, of course, ""Energy Credits"" - and mines. All of which consume the same resources that you need for the expansion and maintenance of your navy.This is an EXTREMELY brief overview of war in Stellaris. In short, I find it a tedious nightmare to manage. But this is, after all, a Paradox game. I have every confidence that in another year - not to mention in another two or three years - Stellaris will be a fantastic game. Right now, it's little more than a foundation. In time, something spectacular could be built here. It just hasn't been built yet.			"

												Unfortunately, I have to agree with a lot of the other negative reviews on here. It doesn't feel finished. The game in its current form just doesn't deserve a recommendation, no matter how much I want to give it one. To rehash what others have said, the early game is a ton of fun. Your race sets out into the stars, bright-eyed and full of wonder at the vastness of the galaxy. You explore, eagerly finding new anomalies scattered amongst the stars. You find asteroids and planets scattered in the darkness. Eventually, you see a habitable world and with your scientists' valiant contributions, create a colony ship to take your people into a new era. The first weird space faring creatures you see are wonderful and are quickly researched to find out more about them. The first alien race you encounter is a great moment, full of excitement. Then more and more races appear until the galaxy is brimming with life! Then it stops. Nothing happens from this point on. You slowly research technology (very slowly). Spread onto a few new worlds in your territory as your tech progresses. But the universe stops reacting and gives you very few things to do other than try to conquer your neighbour out of boredom.Later game, a certain event happened in my game that seems like it should be huge. A truly alien danger appears and threatens to overwhelm the entire galaxy. Then it stops too. It sits in its territory doing nothing for literally hundreds of years. As I'd been a wonderful, peace loving race with a very small navy before this, I was sure I would have to battle for my very survival. But nope, just sat in my territory slowly building a massive death fleet with advanced weaponry that wiped out the so called galactic threat system by system through slow chipping away.All in all, I don't regret buying it, I got a few hours of fun out of it. And I'm sure that Paradox will do their usual thing and turn this into an amazing game in the future. It isn't there yet though, so it is going back into the library for now until the rest of the game comes along.I'd save your money until that amazing game is actually finished.			"

												Even if the genre isn't exactly the same, I like comparing this game to Civ 5.The idea is that you should strive for the stars either diplomatically or martially, so that you more or less become the ruler of the galaxy. Therefore, you do the 4x'es: Xplore, Xpand, Xploit, Xterminate. You build buildings on your planets, you can terraform them, you can build stations around planets that gather resources or give research points, you can trade or you can go to war, either as the lone wolf or in an alliance.Sounds great, doesn't it?It does. But the problem is the 5th X: The Xecution. Trading is even worse than in Civ 5 where you had trade routes AND instant trade: Here, you don't have trade routes at all. If you remember the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor trade menu in Civ 5 with the tiny lines you had to click on and thought it was the worst system possible: Think again. Here, you have a similar list structure, that is bigger, but you have to switch tabs between offerings and demands. Also, the AI sometimes doesn't even accept presents, depite being ""friendly"". However, the AI does only do something when it is sure it will be accepted. So the AI builds alliances at staggering speeds, while you have to check every in-game month whether any of the AI would accept an alliance invite. Diplomacy? Feel free to estabish vastly overpowered embassies, ameliorating the standing with the other faction - until you run of of them, as you can maximally have 4 embassies.Also, remember setting your scout to explore mode in civ 5 and never ever having to manage them again until they either get to the coast or the whole map was explored? Well, be excited by this immersive gameplay decision Stellaris has made: Get ready to manage every very single system survey by hand. Automatic exploration? Nope.Same goes for contruction ships (the workers in Civ 5). Automation? Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. It's even more tedious as your faction's borders expand with time and planets that you couldn't previously mine become available. So if you have a Chile-Style empire (long and narrow), get ready to check all few years whether you can exploit more systems.Reaseach is similar: Get ready to select research targets from 3 different sections (Society, Science and Engineering), which is fun until you run out of Scientists and you get a 20% malus on the research speed. The scientists themselves are Leaders: Guys you need to buy for influence because... ? Civ 5 had a similar thing by being able to buy prophets and stuff for faith points, but they were more or less optional. In Stellaris you don't get anywhere without research.So far, we've established that the diplomacy lacks practically everything needed to be able to be a valuable way to go. Alright. Not what I would have hoped for in a strategy game like this. But then again, war can be entertaining as well, right?Aaaand nope. It all boils down to the simple rule: Steamroll everything or get steamrolled. Remember in Civ 5, when you were furios about the tremendous defense strength a city had, making it nearly impossible to conquer a city until you had catapults? Well, this time, your planets are about the weakest things in the game. Sure, they can't be conquered in the first few minutes, but as your empire grows, it becomes impossible to defend every single planet. Big fleets are far better, even for defense, which is weird at best.Alliances do a♥♥♥♥♥♥job of defending you btw, and the (thankfully disablable) empires starting with an advantage either love you or hate you from the first contact and then will steamroll you to death or leave you be. Seriously. You don't even have to give them a reason to attack you. They just do (similar to civ 5). The only problem then is: The AI does only do things when they are sure they can pull it off. So if they declare war and you're in ironman mode, exit the game and start a new one or give them half your empire, just so they can attack you again after the peace period runs out. It basically always is gg.About the shipdesigning: Well, you design ships. Is cool, but as your fleets will be a blob anyways and you can't see what's going on in fights, you basically just change some stat values.I personally didn't find the UI too confusing, but I can understand why some do: Too many tabs, too many hidden options and too much scrolling to do without clear indicators that you CAN scroll.In the end, I'd consider it as a realtime CIV 5 in space without the hidious round times (as it is an RTS), but with every single contra civ 5 had (Really, it seems to me that Paradox had a checklist of all the bad things about CIV 5 to tick) and none of the pros of balance, trading and automations.I'd say: Pick it up when it's cheaper than 20 bucks, maybe even as a package with the promised DLCs (that should have been in the basegame...) so you get the game it should have been.Don't buy this barebone for 40 bucks.TL:DR:Buy it if you LOVED all things that were flawed in CIV 5, don't buy it if you didn't LOVE civ 5. (Liking doesn't seem sufficient to me)./EDIT: So some patches after, the game hasn't really gotten better. There are still gamebreaking bugs (like inability to leave federations) and the Lategame is basically a stall to any gameplay and yields to doing nothing. You can now research auto-exploration (no, not a default: A research). C'mon man. It's 2016. This game loves micromanaging to much it's literally not fun to play at all if you expect a game and not an excel simulator.			"

ForewordFor those of you wishing a simple 4x game with no strings attached, i cannot quite recommend this game...But for those who like a bit of micromanagement, and the rewarding stories this game promises, read on, though it is a long read.I've thought long and hard about how to recommend this game: I could laud it's semi-random R&D system, which provides you with options relating to what you've researched, and the specialities of the researcher you have in that general division or the ability to customize ship layouts, allowing you to create taskforce fleets which can do any number of things ranging from fire support to swarm tactics to bombing from afar, or even the race creation/customization system. I could give you pros and cons, but i think i have a better way of showing what this game plays like.The long read begins hereLet me weave you a little tale, it's still ongoing but this is what has happened for me up to about..early to mid-game.My (Self-designed) people, the K'trassi Covenant, are a deeply spiritual people who believe in fighting for one's right to exist. They've struggled from the dregs of their corner of the huge galaxy map they're in, and have begun to grow steadily with wormhole stations as their primary mode of transportation. Early on, i'd discovered a few things: I was in a -remote- corner of the galaxy. There weren't -too- many habitable planets..but i could grow unopposed. I did however come across a few other problems.The first large world i colonized, turned out to have ancient terraforming bots on them. I took a gamble and activated them, seeing as at this point, my people were languishing on that world. Lo and behold, i got a massive paradise world in return with no strings attached, so... lucky me! The next bit...well, as i was expanding, i came across some hints of an ancient civilization that had lived in my region a long time ago. I figured that if i could claim their system, i'd have a leg up on any potential rivals, since beyond my initial growth spurt i'd not found any way of consolidating myself. Pirates were a pain, but a quick strike all but neutered them, and i knew that with my options as they were then, i'd likely face far superior empires with a taste for K'trassi flesh, not to mention anything else out there that might want a piece.So i went on a treasure hunt!These relics (six in total) pointed me to a system that was far outside of my range, but i knew i had to get there! My curiosity was killing me! I decided to leapfrog by building wormhole stations, and barely made my claim when i figured out... that by doing so, i had♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off two newly-discovered (and very powerful) neighbors. So i built and expanded my fleet and feverishly researched new military tech to ensure that i would not be overrun for daring to snatch whatever this system was away from them. Now as i do this, i decide to zoom in to the system. As for what i saw, that....well, let's leave that for you to discover. I can give at least a hint in the spoiler: Larry Niven.So i began building myself up around the newly discovered ruined system, with two angry neighbors and at this point, one friendly neighbor (thank you RNGzus), when i discovered something big. Something *REALLY* Big in a system right next to the ruined one.. And that's how far i got before i took a break and thought about writing the (opinion-based) review.TL;DR? O.k...For those of you who've read the story, or those who skipped. You build your own story, and can build your own race, choosing things like societal traits, initial weapons tech and propulsion choice. Each game can be a series of plot twists that can leave you muttering under your breath, or staring in disbelief. The state of the game in the story i played is that i am currently controlling a system with some crazy stuff in it, and the factions that hate me are deadlocked in a cold war against me and my newfound allies: The humans.  Bear in mind though? This is barely mid-game! I could end up being invaded by a random threat, or being embroiled in a civil war, or other such crazy things! What's more? My enemies might suddenly have problems too. Whatever happens can affect anyone, and the balance of power can shift all over!conclusionAll in all, this game is a true gem for people who enjoy galactic scale conquest. It runs fairly smoothly and is a blast to learn and play. It has it's flaws, however, as the game can be overwhelming to start with and some of the systems still need tweaking. But other reviewers are more capable in bringing that to light, and the developers have shown time and again that they are not afraid to re-do entire sections of the game if it doesn't work the way they intended it to.This game is worth a buy in my book. If you're still not sure you can look around at other reviews and the like.			"

												Played it a lot, had moderate fun for a while. Don't look solely at my play time because I usually let the game running while doing other things, but the fact is that the game is very shallow at the moment. Other reviews detail where it is lacking, just look for them. I think there is a solid skeleton of a game here, but I can't recommend it in this state for the current price.			"

												I haven't played many grand-strategy games or even turn based games (civ5) So I was a little bit hesitated about getting Stellaris.But after reading some good postive reviews I finaly decide to jump on the train and see what's it all about.It's suprisely very approachable even if you never really played games like Stellaris.The game is pretty in depth and the combat is fun.I always been much of a multiplayer guy , so I really love how the game packs out during multiplayer.Some people turn their backs against humanity , while others seek alliances. Sure there are a few issues with the game which I am sure Paradox is working on it.Issues like joining multiplayer games , some ingame mechanics tweaks ( sectors front posts don't drawn influence etc)Overall I do recommend this game for anyone out there looking for a new addiction.- Milad			"

												My thoughts after having just played from Earth to overwhemingly defeating a Fallen Empire.It is a good game. I didn't stay up till 6am playing it for nothing. The start is really well thought out and you genuinely feel like a species reaching out into the unknown. The anomalies are great and the randomness of techs means you will start out differently each time. I do have to agree with the mid game complaints though. The problem is that sectors are in no way comparable to playing as a King with a bunch of unruly Dukes to manage. Sectors are too simple. Basically you can add infinite planets to a sector and everything just works. Those areas become effective dead zones on the field. When your empire is growing, and the number of empires in the world is diminishing, internal politics is what would normally offset that decrease in activity. I fully expect this will be addressed in later expansions but it does feel a bit slow grinding up your ship count and having nothing internal happening to occupy you. Thinking of CK2, I consider the empire building and internal power struggles to be the mid game and it's something we don't have here yet.Some of the ship AI isn't great. I had 1000 (the max) ships attacking and they arranged themselves into a column so only 100 could shoot at any time. Pretty frustrating as there was no opportunity to change it. Fortunately the enemy did the same but it took away from the immersion somewhat.Overall I think this game is a whole lot of potential built on some solid foundations. It feels a bit weak in the diplomacy compared to Paradox' less experimental games. I'd also like to see better ship management, maybe using a 3D or layered 2D battlefield to really resolve those collision issues. End game could possibly benefit from some 'supertechs' as I was mostly just getting +5% modifiers to research.Really fun though and I look forward to it getting the true Paradox treatment over the next few years!

												I really enjoy this game, but I'm one of the people that always checks negative reviews to better understand what I'm getting into so here goes.Stellaris is a great starting point to an amazing 4x space game. It is made to be mod friendly, and it shows in base gameplay. You can mod in your own races, change starting conditions of the galaxy, and just about anything you can imagine. However, it also seems that it will be up to the mods to really take this game to the next level in the vanilla version.So what holds this game back? I would say the scale of what this game WILL be actually hurts the fun of the vanilla game at launch. The diplomacy is simple. ""I like you, no war"" or ""Ooh, planet. Declare war out of nowhere."" The planet screens remind me a lot of MoO or, more accurately, Sid Meier's Colonization town screens. You move your pops, create buildings to increase resource output, and generally try to min/max your tiles. However, 22 years is a long time to leave a concept nearly the same. Combat, oh combat. If you are coming from EU4/CK2 then combat will probably be a step up. You can customize your ships (a la every 4x space game now), and group them in fleets to attack. However, actual combat is just moving stacks onto eachother, as in EU4. The feedback is fairly minimal, but DOES provide the info to know what major adjustments to your ships you need to make. Minor details about which modules are effective would be helpful.So overall opinion: I'm enjoying it. I will spend this week making the galaxy Trump again. However, if you are expecting anything near the polish of EU4, remember what EU4 was like on launch. The DLC and patches for this game will be what really determines how great this game is.Edit: For clarity, the reason it is not recommended is because this is NOT at the same level of polish and complexity as other Paradox games RIGHT NOW. If you are looking for that, wait a little while. However, for the price, I would still recommend it by itself and I fully believe it will end up surpassing my hours on EU4 (556 and counting) as the free patches and DLC expand the gameplay.Edit 2 for more clarity: If you are someone who loves the depth and complexity of EU4/CK2, I recommend you wait for some more content to be added. So it's more of a conditional ""don't recommend."" Thanks for all the feedback!			"

												This game makes space great again.It's got one of the best nation/race creation systems since Stars!, unique races that are different every game. It's got a anomalies/events system that is far more expansive than i realised, quest lines to discover precursor race homeworlds and unique techs, lots of star trek like stuff including finding primitive races. You can be entertained for hours without even interacting with the other alien races.It's pretty as well, everything looks sharp, the icons and alien race portraits are all well drawn and distinct.

												Although a lot of reviews say otherwise i really think this is a stellar *hehe* game. Granted it has a lot of flaws, however Paradox have been communicating with people who have bought they game and have been keeping an eye on the Stellaris Subreddit to see what bugs and problems people find with the game. They have already laid out a plan of patches to arrive towards the end of May and through June that will be focusing on the main problems with the game: Diplomacy and AI, whilst also fixing some major bugs and adding some more things in for QoL. If you're a fan of Sci Fi and of games like Civ, Pax Imperia or Master of Orion, I am sure you will enjoy this. Plus, the ability to create your favourite race from a video game (to the best of your ability) and then roleplay as them is really what makes this game great. I mean who doesn't want to create the Imperium of Man from 40k and then proceed to extinguish all alien life in the galaxy for being filthy Xenos? Hell, be space hippies for all i care, just buy the damn game, and I assure you, you won't regret it.  "

												Solid starting point for the development of possibly one of the best strategy games you can find around.Unfortunately at the moment Stellaris lacks gameplay and mechanics to make it a fun and lasting rts: diplomacy is a joke, no market, very poor interaction-with-other-systems dynamics...just to mention some. There are not enough chances of development in mid and late-game, after the first few hours the entire thing becomes quite boring and repetitive.This game has great potential but in its current state it isn't worth the price and I wouldn't recommend it. I really do hope in a Paradox-style intervention like it happened for many big titles they released in the past (EU4 just to mention one..).Looking forward to come back on Stellaris at around the end of 2016 to see some improvement!

												I can't recommend this game.  Which is really too bad becuase it does have some really nice parts.  I loved the races.  I love how beautiful it is.  The battles are decent as well.  The number one main thing that makes this game bad?  You can't decide when to end a war.  Someone can attack you and then before you can even get back at them - they offer peace - you AUTOMATICALLY accept it.  In a game where the major way to win is conquest this is very frustrating.			"

												Love this game. Paradox makes the best strategy games. And they support their products akin to an MMO: so many free content updates. ++ UPDATES++ Extremely replay-able+  Exploration is interesting and feels fun and mysterious+  Multiplayer with friends works great+  Technology research is varied and interesting+  Seems more educated/advised than most space games I have played+  Tons of customization+  Tons of randomization+  Empire creation is fun and thematic: choices affect entire playthrough+  Random events add flavor to the game+  Fun-- Diplomacy is lacking in complexity-- 'Winning' conditions seems tacked on: you have to ignore winning, to RP, if you aren't militaristic-  Combat/Wars are a little dull-  Sector AI is minimal: in a bad way-  Ship designer is a cool idea, however the implementation leaves little flexibility or imagination-  As you grow in size minor tasks can become tedious-  Potential to very easilly systematically steamroll other empires if you know what you are doing-  Planet habbitability could be handled better-  Not enough solar system diversity (e.g. haven't seen multiple stars in a system)-  Too many habbitable planets (They should be more rare and more special and hold more value)All in all it is a very fun game--great to play with a friend--and a lot of my cons are currently being improved on for the next patch (most of the cons may be gone by the time you read this). You can be certain that Paradox will improve the game. Already a fun game as is and only will be getting better. Highly recomend Paradox and Stellaris.			"

												There really needs to be a star system.  I am going to say no but just barely.Good: Great early to mid game.  The best ""sim"" aspect of any 4x space game.  Micro-managers wet dream.Bad:1. Diplomacy is horrific.  Early to mid it is worthless.  Late it is nearly impossible move a faction one way or another.  2. Combat is very simply early to mid almost so much so that it is boring.  Late combat is nearly impossible.  During the late stages when you have 10+ core sectors and you are part of a federation your navy is huge.  Probably around 50k+.  If your federation fights another alliance/federation that is of equil footing, just forget it.  You will get plastered.  Not because their fleet is bigger but because the computer just moves faster.  Not just thinking, their ships just move faster.  Now you might be thinking that is why my computer allies are for right?  Wrong.  Your computer allies does basically one thing when you as a federation/alliance go to war.  They all come to your biggest fleet and just follow you around.  I don't know if that is design flaw or intention but it sucks.  The computer fed/alliance is sending ships to like 10 to 15 systems all in small batches with landing forces.  As soon as they see your big fleet they jump and scatter.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to catch them.  I believe the intention to this tactic was to promote defense stations as they have FTL scramblers.  But at this stage a fleet that huge will blast that station and when your bigger fleet pops in will run and scatter.  Super frustrating.  It is an impossible endeavor to protect a large empire.3. You cannot win a large map.  Victory conditions are 40% of inhabitable planets or complete domination.  600 stars = forever to conquer 40% let alone complete domination.  Even if this was doable (and I suppose several months of play time and you theoretically good) the combat system makes it impossible.  One big war and you are done.  There is no coming back from that.  The war will last forever because of their ""warscore"" method.  It would be an insanely long war.I know this sounds pretty bad.  I am bit emotional because I just had my long game just get wrecked due to the combat system.  It is a great game, but right now they need to address some key late game issues.If you have the money try it out.  If you are a little tight on funds wait a few months.			"

												The game starts out great, but the mechanics simply don't scale into any kind of interesting mid or late game. It takes the Paradox blobbing meta and does it even more generically in space.The AI and politics just aren't good. You either kill everyone or form a giant alliance. Neither path is nuanced.I'm hoping we get some DLC in the future that gives this game some much needed depth, but for now, it's a pass.			"

												I really like this game.  However, there's 1 big problem I keep coming across that is most likely going to keep me from ever playing it again.  That is the workshop.There are hundreds of really cool and interesting workshop items other players have made.  New tech, some stories, races, etc.  The only downside is that when the game updates every workshop item has to update as well.  If it doesn't, you end up with a broken save game.  If you don't mind starting over, that's not an issue.  If you have a 40 hour game that you can't play any longer, that sucks.  I've had to restart several times due to this, and the last one may have done it for me.  I was using a workship add on that put civilian fleets in my game.  I liked the game world looking more populated.  Then, update.  Next time I check the game (even though the addon updated as well) my game now had thousands of 0 health question mark boxes everywhere.  Almost every system had them and they seemed to block troop transports from landing on planets.  They'd just kind of twitch when you try to invade.  This is a really good game and you'll find a lot of value in it.  Just be prepared for updates forcing you to restart.			"

												TL;DR: You either love it or you hate itA lot in Stellaris is broken and the fact that it can only use one core is especially bad, but the time sink should be obvious based on the other games Paradox has created. Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings, Victoria, Hearts of Iron, etc. Victory conditions I think were only put in for people who need them. For the most part, these kinds of games require you to set your own goals and make your own story.It's certainly not for everyone. It's okay if you don't like it. This game isn't just slow-paced, but it's like ultra slow-paced. There can be times where you might have to wait like 3 hours before you're able to do anything. Note: ""Grand Strategy""I think it's mostly Paradox's fault. They tried marketing this game as some sort of ""ultimate space game"". This is a different kind of game than what they've previously made, and shouldn't be so bold in their marketing. Though the DLC's aren't very good for the money, at least it's not nearly as bad as Eu4 or Ck2 (yet).			"

												This game drags a lot. Most choices have only tiny implications, so for most of the time you're sitting around doing nothing, especially if you're winning—i.e, when you're in a position that you want to be in. I've been playing a game for two days and I would say about sixty percent of my time has been spent sitting around waiting to integrate a vassal or waiting to be president of the federation so I can declare war. It can be very exciting, especially during warfare, but there are huge gaps when you literally have to return after about an hour before you can do anything that is remotely fun. You'd think that a galactic empire would be bustling with activity, but as this game stands there is not much to do.			"

												Pros:- AI diplomacy is interesting. Not good, not bad, just interesting. While flawed, it provided some life in an otherwise lifeless galaxy (explained more in cons). It's nice seeing lesser empires scramble to cosy up to one another once I had a death ball knocking on their door.That's about it im afraid. Moving on to...Cons:- Death ball. ♥♥♥♥ strategy when you can just roll in and out with different configs to fight against different enemies. It severely cheapens that sense of joy when you unlock bigger ships, because you can just distract the enemy's fleet with a bunch of cheap corvettes/destroyers specced out appropriately. I am talking within the context of the mid-game of course. Why? because..- Horrible pacing. I couldn't stand to reach the end game because of all the horrible UX for micro-managing, my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ neighbors' space drama with one another (of which you will often find yourself be part of), and how limiting space is. Speaking of which..- The ""Final Frontier"" is a pretty small frontier. If you're up against 13 empires in a medium galaxy, expect things to get crowded real fast. Get past the early-game, and all you have left to do is to 1. wage war, 2. mindlessly explore systems that you will never get to conquer,3. attempt to convince your racist neighbors that you are a pretty nice guy, and a fedaration is a pretty cool deal.- Fedaration members are like that friend who relies on you to clean up their♥♥♥♥♥♥ I really hope that the federation system is improved so that the lesser empires have to vote on whether to declare war against another empire. Overall, I can't say it's a bad sci-fi 4X, but it has a bunch of polishing to go through before it can even be anywhere as polished as the other 4X sci-fi games out there (at least endless space has decent early-mid game and is forgiving enough to make the late-game end quick). Stay away from this, and check back again next year.			"

												Stellaris is only an unenthusiastic recommendation from me. The game is competent, but uninspired. I don't regret buying it, and maybe it'll have a chance to come great with a bunch of patches and the obligatory DLC, but the game does nothing to overcome the mid to end game grind typical of the genre.I've played 25 hours of Stellaris and restarted three or four times. Each time I expanded for around 6-10 hours or so with little in the way of competition, then started a completely unnecessary war out of sheer boredom. After either winning or stalemating the war, I looked around and observed that at the same rate I had at least another 6-10 hours of the same before hitting anything approximating a win condition. At this point I deleted my save game and started again.The game’s big selling point, the supposed ‘stories’ that mix things up and make every game different, weren’t particularly obvious to me. My first game did result in an event where my civilization immediately spawned a 'splinter group' (basically, pirates). This ended up nerfing my start, but other than that I hunted them down and killed them, ending that particular story line. Every other game has largely followed the same trajectory, minus the initial rebellion.Mostly, the same half dozen mini-missions (research anomalies) appear in regular rotation - ancient graffiti, ruined ancient organic star ship, ancient comet crashing into a planet, etc. Meh.The other civilizations are all generic, and I regret my impulse preorder purchase to get a few more ‘cosmetic’ options for the other races in the galaxy (different portraits). These portraits don’t spend enough time on my screen for them to even register.As far as emergent events are concerned numerous games do it far better. Spore’s end-game for one. Not to mention related procedurally generated SF ARPGs such as SPAZ and Space Rangers 2, where you can genuinely feel the life of the galaxy going on around you. In Stellaris, unfortunately, the universe feels almost entirely static and empty.To finish on a few specifics, 75% of the gameplay seems to be micromanaging scout ships exploring and constructors building mines and research outposts, even into the late mid-game. There are no unit automation options, such as Civ's autoexplore and autoimprove, which is probably intentional since eliminating these two options would obviously also eliminate 75% of the gameplay.Ship design feels like an add-on. Basically, research bigger ship size, maximise ship design for dps, research for a bigger ship size again… rinse and repeat.Ultimately, playing on a sparse star field has little of the charm of Civ's changing geographies. In the absence of the buzz associated with discovering new coastlines, mountain ranges, swamps, rivers and cities, a space 4X really needs to offer something else. Stellaris promised to add that interest with its emergent storytelling. Sadly, with the game in its current empty state I’m not seeing it at the moment.			"

Posted: May 16, 2016
												Paradox' latest title has gotten a lot of good reviews, but unfortunately I cannot agree with most of them.Stellaris is a combination of 4X and Grand Strategy, but does neither one very good. It's very much like that pretty girl from the store you really like. You woo her and it starts off very fun, but after spending an evening with her she gets on your nerves and turns out to be extremely high maintenance.Everything starts quite well, with an expansive customization of your empire, where you choose government form, ethics and starting technologies. The early game is definitely the best part of Stellaris: It has a lot of exploration, quests and interesting choices concerning your research and expansion.This quickly turns around as you move into the midgame though. Quests dry up quickly, exploration comes to a full stop as you run into the borders of alien empires, and it turns out that where you expand to does not matter, as long as you do it quickly and grab as much stuff as you can. The where and how is not that important for a few reasons:- The important resources, namely Energy and Minerals, can be gathered anywhere.- The strategic resources are not very relevant.To prevent you from becoming too powerful too quickly, Stellaris forces you to give up control of planets beyond the 5th. All extra planets must be put in Sectors, which are AI controlled regions. When asking Merni (a developer) on Twitter, she said that the main purpose of Sectors was to reduce micromangement.This is not true. Not only do they increase micromanagement, as I will explain below, but there are techs and government forms that allow you to get player control over more of them. Meaning that it is seen as a direct bonus to be able to control them.What is bad about sectors ? Well, here is a short list of problems:- The AI is incompetent in managing their planets- Sectors require resources to build up and then pay a tax (percentage of their income). The problem here is: they also stockpile resources that become inaccessible to you, and you have to constantly check if they need resources.- You constantly have to check what they are doing and sometimes manually correct this- Managing a planet in a sector requires something like 12 clicks.- If you build a colony ship in a sector, it won't show up in your ship list. So you have to constantly check the map/systems- You can only put an entire starsystem in a sector, not individual planets. So, if you have a system with 4 habitable worlds, of which you want to manage 1 because it's great, well that's too bad, you are screwed.- You don't get quests for planets in sectors- You don't get to do observation of lesser races in sectors, or at least don't get proper alerts for it- Changing sectors costs influence, a rare resource. You can accidently, due to bad interface, burn through all your influence this way.- In short, sectors cause a huge headache and an overwhelming amount of micromanagement, all just to screw over the playerQuests are another major annoyance. It all starts well, and the stories around them are pretty good. Unfortunately the quests are very shallow, and are almost exclusively: bring a science ship, and use the clicky. Unlike in a game like Civilization V for example, where City State quests require a lot of diferent types of things: gathering a resource, trading for a luxury, trying to get techs, a wonder, explore, kill barbarians... There is none of that here. The only quest you will get in this game is: Use the clicky, or spend some science points.You will also start seeing repeat quests very quickly, likely within your very first game. As said above, sectors do not seem to provide quests properly. Maybe it's a bug, more likely it's a badly thought out feature.Finally we come to the cluster♥♥♥♥ that is combat. There is a lot to go through here so lets get started with minor stuff:- Land invasions are completely non-interactive. This is a lot worse than EU4, you just click and then well, wait.- Land units can be equipped with an improvement. Except, no one tells you this, and there is no icon or link that gives an indication this is possible, you just have to find out.- Land units have to be transported in ultravulnerable ships, you can't just have them on board of your fleet. It's just another headache.- Space battles are completely non-interactive. Not only that, but your ships will actively pursue mining stations during a fleet battle for example, which can completely screw you over.- Space battles starting in the mid game hog so much resources that it slows down (and possibly overheats) your pc.- Most wars are determined in a single battle. While a player might be able to trap the AI's fleet through elaborate schemes in order to rebuild, the AI cannot do this. This means that if the AI engages you with an insufficiently big stack, it's dead and you just won the war as recovery is impossible- Space wars are annoying, it's a lot of avoiding eachother since the bigger stack will almost always win, unless you built your fleet entirely wrong.- Fleets can get stuck in situations of indecision, when they are floating between two equally attractive targets. They can also get stuck at long range without ever moving close enough to use their weapons.- Fleets can get stuck in separate parts of your empire after a peace treaty, as you have no control over where they go after a war ends. They just go ""somewhere"".- Interface is horrible when trying to manage multiple ships and/or fleetsThe final pillar of the game, Science, starts as a very interesting novelty where you can choose from several different techs each time. While this is certainly an innovation, the randomness can completely screw you over, there is no in-game tech tree to see what you need for what.Furthermore, you quickly run out of techs around the midgame, and everything you get after that is small passive bonuses. The ""dangerous"" late game techs provide only small advantages so they are not actually worth researching, and it's not incremental slippery slope deal either.Aside of that, there are very, very few techs that offer interesting new things other than small upgrades to your ship tech. All interesting techs are in Societal research, where you unlock uplifting and genetic modifications.Now, I'm not opposed to the idea of unlocking small upgrades, but there is nothing else to teching up. There are no wonders in this game, and very few unique things.This leads to it all feeling very much the same. To the point even where at one point, a single techs unlocks 2 tiers (!!) of the same upgrade.That brings us to the end of this complaint/review, with some loose comments:- There is no trade- There is no espionage- The diplomacy is extremely shallow compared to EU4- There are no luxuries and strategic resources are irrelevant- The only victory conditions are either conquering everyone, or having 40% of the planets. There are no peaceful victories- AI's will not actively pursue victory, they just hang around and don't do anything goal oriented.- Talking about AI's: if you have allies or vassals in a war, they will do nothing (!!). They will just put their fleets on follow of your largest active fleet. So if your biggest fleet is in part A of the galaxy, and your invasion fleet is in part B and needs help... tough luck !- I ""won"" 10 hours into my campaign, but needed 40 more to actually get to the victory screen. Once you snowball, unless you are stupid, nothing will be able to stop you. This becomes boring and tedious really fast.In conclusion:While this game looks good and starts of fine, it quickly becomes an overwhelming amount of micromanagement with very little strategy involved. This game will need several expansions before it gets really good, and will end up being a 100 € game before it's really enjoyable.			"

												I've played enough by now to know that this is a solid and good game.  It has some interesting things to say about the 4x model and correctly approaches the many pitfalls that other games just like it have failed at.  In the end it also has a good price-point, which talks to me about the thought put into addressing it's audience.O.K.  The good, the bad and the ugly:Good: It has intricate depth to almost all aspects of the game.  Once you think you have figured something out, you quickly find out that there is much much more.  The sound track is REALLY good.  The AI does not simply focus on KILL KILL KILL. They act appropriate to their civ traits and tech levels (shocker).  It's really a very pretty game.Bad:  The AI that ""auto-designs"" your space fleet is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible and, until I figured out what was going on, I lost like 4 or 5 games to crazy inferior civs because of it.  The UI needs some tweeking (for example: there are moons that you need to click on sometimes that are so small that you have to barely adjust your mouse this way or that in order to click it... very dumb).  The tutorial for the game does a farely decent job at addressing the basics like what one interface or another is for, but does nothing for others.  Additionally, there are entire aspects of the game that could use SOME sort of information, but has none to offer.  In some way this lends to an atmosphere of mystery, but some people would just call this poor game design.The inbetween:  The tech tree is non-existant.  In lue of this basic 4x concept the game uses a new and interesting mechanic that the game designers call a sort of semi-random lottery.  You draw 3 random techs from the pool of possible techs every time you start a new game or finish researching a technology.  It's really interesting to be sure, but semi-frustrating because I have no idea what the technologies are that are possible.  My initial frustration was that I couldn't make a plan... like in CIV 5 for example.  In Civ 5 I look at the tech tree and look at what resources are available and make a plan that involves my ersearch path and the units I build to take advantage of available materials around my cities.  After playin about 15 games now I can tell you that I really like the way Stellaris does this.  I'm sure that the developers looked at this and called it a risk, but in the end I think it's something unique... a risk in game design that has payed off.The ugly:  Fleet battles in Stellaris are sure pretty, but unlike a game like Sins of a Solar Empire that absolutely hit the concept of ""Fleet Battles"" out of the ♥♥♥♥ing park home-run style... Stellaris really just failed.  Once a battle begins you have NO ♥♥♥♥ing control over it what-so-♥♥♥♥ing-ever.  You can't, for example, force a singular ship that is being focused by the other fleet to retreat.  There is only one ♥♥♥♥ing thing you can ♥♥♥♥-all do once combat begins: force the entire fleet to retreat... and oddly enough there is a random trait that fleet leaders can develop after retreating that disable even that small piece of control. SO. ♥♥♥♥ING. FRUSTRATING.So all that said I think that if you like games like CIV 5, Gal Civ, Sins or any 4x like that, then you should certainly check this game out.  I'm still having a lot of fun with it.			"

Posted: May 11, 2016
												I loved playing this game in the early stages. Resources were scarce and i felt compelled to move out into the galaxy (get more energy, always more energy)I did probably start with a galaxy that was to big (800 systems and alot of ai races) This meant i had quite a bit of growing to do before i hit the borders of another faction (so no need to fight or compete with anyone else early) The different races also prefer different planets wich is cool, but kinda kept the competition low since i was one of the only races who went for continental planets.Anyway i got to the mid game without any problems, with only a few races ahed of me in power/tech. I had a nice big empire around 15planets and all the resources i could need, and here lies the problem.. Since i have all that i need to reserch new tech, feed my navies and so forth, what reason do i have to go to war? Or trade? None :p There is absolutley nothing to do.... Ive been in two wars sofar! With the first being initiated by me on this bird race who hated me from the start, those xenophobic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They were ahed of me in fleet size and fleet tech. No need to worry, i got my ally involved and he helped me make a bigger blob of ships equal to 10k power, vs the enemy 6k. Needless to say the war lasted for 1battle and a few planetary assults. Since their navy was dead there was no opposition and i was just running around with transports(boring)Eventually another empire decleared war on them sensing weakness and the cowardly birds sued for peace. Now this was a big(ish) empire but i could instantly make them a vassal + release part of their empire, who later joined my alliance..The second war was initiated by my ally vs another xenophobic reptilian race who had rivaled both of us and had a big border vs my ally.Again my ally sent their entire fleet to me so to make the biggest blorg (blob) and whack the enemy fleet out of the game in 2battles (fun right?)Now here i have two gripes: 1: Why do i need to lead the ai fleets around?? I had NO stake in that war and only wanted to give token support to my ally.. But he refused to do ANYTHING on his own :p I tried parking my fleet around my homeworld and he just sat there while the enemy burned his worlds. Finally i caved and sent our blob of death to the enemy homeworld. That got his intention and he sent his fleet to defend.. This was the only reason i went deep into his empire, I wanted to face his fleet and autowin the war (fun right?) The battle system in crusader kings have more depth then this!! Im sorry to say: The combat, it just sucks.... :o I cant describe the lack of satisfaction in fighting wars like this :(1: The game lacks depth, plain and simple.. I am used to more from paradox and i dont know why they went in this direction2: You can probably optimise your empire way better then i did.. But why care? When i got everything i needed by uppgrading powerplans/mines. Maybe its different on smaller maps? Then again, i diddentt want to play smaller maps :p3: Diplomacy and trade: Its lacking depth, its lacking function (as in: i need x from you, here take my y) Ive had very little meaningfull trade deals (research deals being one) Just to give one example: The ai i made into a vassall hate me. They are disloyal, and still when the second war came, they were there fighting by my side with the few ships they had managed to rebuild :p They hate me, but has no problems dying for me?Alliances are meaningfull i guess, and i havent tried federation yet.4: Resources: There are special resources that can be used to improve certain things: happiness, better powerplant, weapons and whatnot, but i never feel like a need them! My needs are already met within my empire.5: Population: I dont know if this is broken, but all pops are loyalists. No other faction exsist. I have several sectors, though i do not allow other empires migration rights. Not sure whats supposed to trigger other factions.6: My population does not seem unhappy, like ever. Ive not made any happiness buildings in my empire (i am at the battleship phase) and i can detect no negative effects.. Or if there are, they are not severe enough for me to care.7: It does not feel like grand strategy.. It feels like most of the other 4x games recently, but in real time and with less depth.8: Information: I struggle to keep track of the relations between other empires. Who are friends and who are enemies. I have a few enemies (as in ppl who hate me) but i have no reason to care :p I made a vassal out of one of the bigger empires in my part of the map and the other guys did nothing. I got no worried diplomats at my door, no federations (just leagues or anything like that) to curtail my aggression! They probably hate me a bit more but who cares? :p I did see my ally had some negative points vs me due to terror bombings I bombed enemy planets? Arent you supposed to do that to reduce fortifications? ^^ I even used the least aggressive stance!Ive had 20hours playing this game, and i am bored :( Ive never been bored in a paradox game before, and i play most of them: Europa universalis, Hearts of Iron, Crusader kings, Victoria... It may be a good starting point for someone new to paradox, to ease them into a game without to much to worry about. But i cant recomend it to veterans of paradox games.Or even anyone who are used to games like civilizations, or even realtime strategy games.The realtime combat makes you want controll, but the game just wont let you.I was so hyped for this, and now i am heartbroken. This was supposed to rekindle my love for the 4x genra and keep me playing for years(like victoria 2, crusader kings + +) and help me while waiting for Hearts of iron and Totalwar warhammer.Ohwell, back to viking conquest i guess </3:/			"

												Can't recommend this game with clear conscience. Not yet.It starts out great. The race creator is great. The galaxy is beautiful, as is the music. Exploring planets and discovering things is really fun. It looks and plays like a great game. Then it grinds to a screeching halt.Plenty of promised features are absolute bare bones. There are, for example, very few diplomatic options compared to other Paradox games - mostly standard 4X stuff like declaring war, trading for resources, border access, etc. It could have been enough if half of this stuff wasn't broken . For example, you can't ask for civilian or military access if your borders don't touch, which means you can get blocked off by the AI and can't even remedy this short of going to war.It's still better than the state of some other features. Sectors? They barely build anything, don't clear tile blockers, destroy strategic resources to build a Hydroponic Farm. Federations? Just a super-alliance witht he ability to build an additional fleet which counts towards the Presidents naval limit (so the AI will disband it as soon as it takes over). Internal politics? For 53 years I didn't even see a faction appearing, let alone a rebellion.The AI also isn't anything to write home about. It used to have problem with expanding, though this seems to have been fixed in a beta patch. Still, it's pretty passive and content to leave you alone in your corner of the galaxy (unless it's some hyperaggressive personality). Sometimes it definitely has problems with waging war - when my enemy finally decided to crush me, they just flew their ships through all my systems then disappeared somewhere and didn't react as I bombarded one of their worlds into oblivion. Your allies and vassals just follow your main fleet, not even defending their core worlds when attacked.And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ the lack of polish is glaring. I already wrote about broken sectors, which is compounded by the fact the game won't let you micromanage them and wants you to pay Influence just for taking a planet out. When the AI demands a planet as a wargoal and someone else takes it, it will never end the war. There is no automatic survey, you're supposed to click on every star you want to check out.  At least one late game crisis is impossible to be resolved because of broken triggers. There are plenty of examples where the game could have used more testing.Don't expect another CK2 - currently it's more like Sengoku,			"

												First time writing a review, but I felt the need to warn others.Was really intrigued by this game, as it hits all of my soft spots: 4x, space, etc. It looks awfully pretty, like a strategy version of Elite: Dangerous.However, that's the end of my list of positives. If a game is a series of interesting choices, then this is not a game. Every part of it, from building and colonizing planets, to exploration, to combat, feels rote and superficial. You simply set up stations near resources, upgrade your level 2 mines to level 3 mines, build more corvettes, and wait for the queues to finish.Combat is laughable, even after this recent patch. There's no reason to build anything other than corvettes, the basic ship. Tech upon tech adds complexity in the form of military stations, defense platforms, larger ships, etc, all of which are fairly useless. You simply build a corvette swarm, click on the enemy, wait for them to explode. Whee.Other empires look fun, but are basically identical, with ethics providing a thin veneer of personality. Think Civ 5 AI, but without unique abilities, aggression, or anything else worth talking about.A lot of hype was built around anomalies and exploration, but 90% of the anomalies I found simply unlocked a resource or gave me a research boost. No choices, nothing interesting. Even the flavor text was repetitive by my second game.Ultimately, this has the depth of a $5-10 strategy game, with the blatant intention of filling in the gaping chasms with paid DLC and expansions. I feel conned out of my $40.			"

												This is the true opposite of sleeping pills. Amazing!Ai is a little weird sometimes (see example below) but gameplay is very fun and smooth. A ""just one more turn game"" even though it is not turn based.Only negative experience was with a neighboring empire that declared war on me. They were superior but I barely managed to fight them of with me fleet and weapon platform positioned at my home system. They then retreated to their home system and allowed me to pick of their outer systems. In the end I had accumulated high enough war score to demand vassalisation.			"

												Great game, a serious time sink.  The maps, even the small ones are still huge and will take days to win.  This is Spore meets Civ V, in randomly generated galaxies.  You can play as any race, but I do enjoy the customization you can do.  I usually go with humans of my own design from out solar system, Sol.    You can meet advanced races or even those in primative ages, and lift them up as part of your empire, or Xfile them and infiltrate their governments until you run their entire world.Enslave or be peaceful, this game is a lot of fun.  I also enjoy being able to customize ship parts, and defensive stations.  This game also supports mods.Down side is the game has to be played on Ironman mode it seems to be able to unlock any achievements.			"

												First thoughts (will replace with more indepth later:Pros:  - The best 4X space game I have played since MOO.  All I wanted was the same feel and gameplay witout feature creep but updated.- Great options to start the game with or simple quick start- The extras are not tedious.  There is not too much to manage but just the right amount for me.- Sooo much room for mods etc to make the game almost anything you want (I like EU games for this)  Cons:- ships looking the same- a little generic feeling even though there are so many options.  Even though the text might be different the mechanics are much the same for every research project I have stumbled across.Overall I think the game is amazing and has kept me glued to it when I thought I had burnt myself out on PC games and MMOs.  Truly a breath of fresh air! . .even though it is just better old awesome air.			"

Yet, I will keep this review simple, as I plan on writing one hell of a monster very soon.Gameplay from an Ork:

Jokes aside, for those who have played about 30 minutes and are ready to give up: I know the UI is almost impossible at the beginning, it's because Stellaris is unlike many 4x Space Strategy games in the same genre. Take your time, learn how to play it and what makes it unique compared to the other 4x's games out there. You won't regret it, you'll be glad you learned this new take on the genre.For those who are having a buggy launch: Give it time, don't refund it yet as this may be a game you end up enjoying if the problems are solved.For those who think this is the best game ever: After 9.5 hours of straight Stellaris goodness, I can safely say, somethings are being exaggerated. This game is damn good and leaves room for plenty of additional content in the future but it's not the best 4x Strategy game ever. It does a lot good but it mostly does things that have already been done in a new way so it's more of refreshing perspective than it is a genre defining masterpiece.For those on the fence: Take the plunge, unless you're having a buggy launch, you can't go wrong. Look at the treatment other Paradox games get, there will be more content to go with this already sizeable game.			"

												My people were happy, species flocked from around the galaxy to inhabit worlds I colonised with robots especially for them in advance. I had a welfare policy that left noone out and all species were represented fairly. My navy was vast and had the most advanced weapons and defences due to our unrivaled technology. All envied us.Then they came, destroying everything in their path, devouring all. At first we did not worry as it was on the other side of the galactic centre, but they moved so quickly. A decision was made to bulk up the navy, a fleet was assembled the likes of which the galaxy had never seen before. The plan was to go straight for the head and remove it and at first the battle went well. We were outnumbered 4:1 but out superior range and technology meant we could push forward, but they just kept coming. As each fleet was left as scrap behind us more took their place and our losses grew. We tried to send reinforments but it wasn't enough, the grand fleet was lost.An allience of once friendly neighbours were startled by our sudden militerisation but envious eyes turned on us when they saw our mighty fleet fall. They declared on us, we pleaded, we pointed out we were trying to protect the galaxy but they would not listen. Our empire shrank to a fraction of its original size, it fringes annexed and pasted around as a prizes. We then watched as each fell to the hungry, not with glee, but with sadness as we knew we would fall soon after. Great game. Make your own stories. Role play is a big part of it for me. A lovely grand stratergy.			"

												Sept 19, 2016New updates all look like great improvements, BUT announcements like ""content that is larger than an event pack but smaller than a full expansion."" is the problem with Paradox. More unethical nickel-and-dime tactics. If Paradox were honest this is what they would say: ""Stellaris: release date 2017. $60 US.""Game still isn't finished and they're asking the consumer to spend more money on it.Aug 27, 2016At this point, I think it would better if Paradox stopped releasing any updates. Call Stellaris done. You made the game, you released it, it failed. Work on EVERYTHING wrong with it behind the scenes. Get all the features into one large expansion and release that. No more than one such expansion per year. In the meantime, only release patches for actual bugs. This would sit better with me as a consumer than this piecemeal, ""We fixed the game a little, but to get the whole fix, pay us more."" It's like if the person who installed my sink did a bad job, came over and fixed it with duct tape, and then told me, ""But if you really want your sink to work, pay me for some new parts."" This is neither a good work ethic nor a good business ethic. Eat your humble pie, regroup, and then release a new game (with a discount to current owners of course) or a major end-all-be-all expansion (ie: the kind that only come once a year--the kind that games use to make).Regarding gameplay, I discuss more of my thoughts comparing Stellaris to Master of Orion in the following video:

			Views: 717		

			In this episode/review, I begin the first few turns of the Sakkra Brood in Master of Orion. Skip to 17:20 to bypass game setup and introduction.		

Aug 4, 2016At best this game has been boring from the start. But I held off writing a negative review because it had the potential to be a great game if the devs responded to community feedback and increased the content in a measured fashion (instead of relying on mods to do that for them). But with the release of the first DLC, the proverbial camel's back has been broken. Let me first explain what this game was lacking in cosmetics that irked me: There are only 6 ship models in the game. You can have dozens of factions, but there are only 6 ship model styles to choose from. You couldn't even at least select a color for the ship chrome. Now, compare to most games where there is a unique ship model for EVERY faction (and that always comes out to being more than 6). The city artwork is similarly non-diversified. What a wasted opportunity for immersion.Now the boring: The game is slow. Immersion would really help here, but as I said above, there's too little to carry me over. Every faction I play and every faction I meet just feels like ""Alien Species #2"". Ironically, when you first meet alien races that exactly how they're labeled... Another reason this game is boring is that the starts always feel formulaic. There will always be an inhabitable planet within your starting territory that is medium size. There will always be a large planet just outside your empire range. ALWAYS. So you automatically research colony ship and always colonize basically the same way. There's no square 1 diversification in the game. You don't have to be a statistician to understand that a slight variable early on has large repurcussions down the line. What a wasted opportunity to make the game play differently each time. Instead there's the same hostile BS in surrounding systems. The same gas grazers, etc. Same same same.As I said, races feel very ""samey"" because you are too limited on how many picks you can take and the differences those picks make don't really make your race that radically different. One HUGE reason this is stymied is that there are many interesting -1 quirks to allow you to get positive traits, but since you can only take 4 picks period, well... you can take 4 interesting -1 quirks and then be left with ... yep, 0 picks to spend on positive traits. So you end up taking a couple of quirks that really don't push your race one way or the other toward something interesting. HATE HATE HATE. ""But it's fixed in the mods"" ""Use the extended traits mods"" Sorry, it's the vanilla game that counts here. I'm not fixing the game with other peoples' stuff. I want to BUY a COMPLETE game. Not have to fix it myself with mods that may or may not contain the changes that would make me happy. VANILLA GAME COUNTS. Next you'll tell me how Phantom Menace was a good movie if I'd read the novelization or some crap. NO.What's the biggest fix that has gone unaddressed with the game? Nothing less than the END GAME. What is the end game? Well... er... you get bored. Because there is no diplomatic victory, no military victory, no economics, no... well... nothing except control everything everywhere. For some, this may be fine. For me, it means that after a certain ""charm"" point (where you're still discovering new features in the game) it turns into a slog. Kill. Repeat. Kill. Repeat. Could there please be some other alternative for ending the game? Other than me getting bored?But in the end, it's the terrible ethics of the developer that have pushed me into outrage. You are asking people to PAY for cosmetic DLC when the core game itself is still woefully lacking. You should be GIVING this art away. It should have been there IN THE FIRST PLACE. Compare this team's work ethic to that of the team behind Cities: Skylines. They continued to add major modifications to their base game even after releasing DLC. Their approach toward their core game was so admirable I bought their DLC simply to support them. Did I need snow or after dark? No. But I appreciate that they added underground lanes to the base game (instead of making it a DLC) so much that I felt obliged to buy their DLC. You should too. Please encourage developers like those behind Cities: Skylines and Thea: The Awakening. And please discourage Paradox from these shennanigans. If you want to play Stellaris, my recommendation is ONLY BUY ON SALE.If you want a good space 4x game, check out the Master of Orion reboot.PS For would-be pedantic phallus weeds: Developer is not the same as publisher. Keep that in mind before you miss the point I'm making about Cities:Skylines.			"

												It's been said that everything is better when space is involved, whether it be Godzilla, Dragonball, or, in this case, Strategy games. While there are probably exceptions to that... Stellaris is not one of them. This Europa Universalis/Civilization game, in space, is pretty neat. :DIf you have played Paradox strategy games before, then you have a pretty good idea what you are in for: lots of detail, variety, and complexity in order to make a game with enormous depth and replayability. This time around however, there might be even more of it, since you are no longer confined to the realms of history. For there are... aliens! Quite alot of them too. In fact there's basically a limitless number of potential species at play here between the pre-created ones, the random generator, and, my personal favorite, your own imagination as you are able to create and customize your own empires to play as. Oh, and there is a unit editor too that you get to play with, with lots of custom modules you unlock via research in the game.I'm a bit of a sucker for customization, so having that stuff was already a major plus for me. It's one of the reasons I liked Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri so much. I played with the unit editor in that to an insane degree, and the one in Stellaris is about equal, if not better. But, since this is a Paradox game, there is also a mountain of policy stuff and edicts you can enact that further improve the customization. What kind of space empire do you want to play? Do you want to be the huggly democracy who loves aliens and being nice to people? How about a psychopathic empire that enslaves, purges xenos, and nukes planets for fun? Or perhaps a science-driven nation that has few scruples and is not above screwing with underdeveloped civilizations? You can do all of that and more. And, naturally, you can change your style throughout the game as well if you want to.The technology stuff is pretty interesting too, with everything you research adding new buildings, modules to attach to ships, or more options to help your space empire run better. You are free to choose what to research, which further adds to the freedom of choice this game has by allowing you to pursue what you desire. While there are some ""pathways"" in the sense that you will need to research basic laser guns before you can move on to more advanced ones, for the most part you are free to pursue whatever tech you wish. Also when you fight people, you can use your science ships to scan the debris of your enemies in order to gain further scientific knowledge that you might have yet to unlock. So even if you aren't a science god, you can always just murder people and steal their research instead. XDBut... be careful. Because while this game starts out essentially as Europa/Civilization in space, there are some added twists that can shake up your game and have severe consequences. I'm talking about two things: Fallen Empires and Crisis events. Fallen Empires are, as the name implies, ancient space empires that have declined and retreated to closed-off enclaves where they sit and watch the galaxy as the new civilizations grow and fight it out. Sometimes they might decide to wake up and try to regain their former glory - at the expense of everyone else.♥♥♥♥♥♥them off and they will unleash some serious power - but if you can beat them their gigantic tech advantage can become yours as well once you have salvaged the remains of their mighty fleets. And one way to♥♥♥♥♥♥them off is to meddle in dangerous research projects that these ancient empires, in their arrogance and experience, probably know won't lead to anything good. Go too far and you might provoke one of the game's three end-game ""Crisis"" events that unleash a deadly foe that has the potential to take over the entire galaxy if you are not careful. Go ahead and research sentient AI tech, create synthetics that are superior to organics in just about every way, have them fight your battles and work your mines, and then don't be surprised if those AI's decide one day that killing you, and all other organics, would be fun. Or create jump drives that open holes in space to allow fast travel... only to have something crawl out of those holes that is quite... hungry. Lastly, there's the good old Tyranid/Zerg style bug invasion, though I have yet to actually experience that one because unlike those other two there is no technology to research in order to trigger their arrival. And it's the last achievement I need too... :(I could keep going on and on about this gamey, but I have to stop at some point and that may as well be now. Besides, all you need to know is whether or not this game is a yummy strategy title that is fun to play and play alot of. And the answer to that is simple and very uncomplicated: Yes.Nom nom space game. :D			"

												Stellaris is a grand strategy game set in space, made by Paradox. It's perhaps the first strategy game I have played in a very long time. When I was younger, Command & Conquer games were some of my favorites and also Age of Empires, but during the years I jumped into different genres I guess. I haven't played Paradox's earlier games much at all, but I absolutely love Stellaris.In Stellaris, your goal is to build a galactic empire. When you start the game, you have the option of choosing from about 8 pre-defined species to start your journey as. Or you can completely create your own species, which I enjoy doing. There's about 6 species groups and 60-70 different species to choose from, home planet type, design of your ships/buildings, your traits that define your race. Like breeding speed, are they militaristic empire or peaceful ones. I maybe used one hour on first time to design my Fox people. It's really fun :).Before starting game, you get to choose the galaxy size, galaxy shape from few options, AI opponent amount etc. Max amount of stars currently is 1000 and it is huge! 


1000 star Ellipse galaxy. I like the colorful map :D.

Anyway, there are a lot of things you get to customize before you begin conquest. Also there is a thing called ""Iron Man"" mode, which I didn't realize to put on first. It's like a hard more and you only have one save game, the auto save. So there is no returning back from mistakes. It also enables achievements.The gameplay is fun and there are a lot of things to learn. It's just a pure joy watching the solar systems, exploring new areas and slowly spreading your empire. It can feel overwhelming first. The kind of slow pace in this game is great. You will encounter many new species and will they be your enemy or friend, that is up to you. Combat isn't very detailed, but that is okey. The tutorial also for is good and the AI-voice helps a lot along the way if you choose so.Multiplayer is sweet. Friends can join your game and take control of one AI species, so you can conquer the galaxy together. Or you can start a new game completely.Soundtrack of Stellaris is quite epic and it's very enjoyable to listen to while exploring. OST  reminds me of movies like Interstellar and Tron Legacy or games like Mass Effect and Deus Ex:Human Revolution. So fans of those will surely love it. A good music is important with a long game like this in my opinion.Anyone who loves sci-fi and strategy genre, pick this game up. You will maybe like Stellaris too. I can imagine spending hundreds of hours with this. I'd play it non-stop if I only didn't have so many other games to play too.It's a stellar experience.			"

												Combining Master of Orion with Europa Universalis, that just has to be the one of the greatest game ideas ever.  At the beginning, the game feels awesome. The races are well designed, and researchable technologies are more or less scientifically realistic. The 3 different FTL technologies give a nice strategic depth to the game, which can also be at times frustrating. The game lacks diplomatic relation mechanisms. It is hard to see or understand why some races attack you.  Even playing passively your neighbors randomly declare war on you. Trying to gain an ally is often hindered by missing a few positive relation points with no way to gain further points. Often I ended up as a strong lonely nation that gets beaten down by strong alliances. If I finally manage to gain an alliance friend, I get a declaration of war by some other alliance further away that somehow manages to pass through occupied space to invade my planets. I am sure this can be understood after a certain amount of play time, still the different map overviews in EU4 were a lot easier to analyze. Here are none. Further the AI tends to create many small fleets. Fighting 2 nations with different FTLs at the same time, each of them having 5-6 perfectly micromanaged fleets, while you are trying to send your 2-3 larger fleets defending your empire is rather annoying. Not to mention, bigger fights even bring the best PCs to its knees with 2-3 FPS. The CPU just can’t keep up.The early game has been nicely polished and gives a positive playing experience. The further you get into the game, the more unfinished elements appear. The game just got released to early and seems unfinished. I am sure Paradox will release several DLCs and patches making this raw diamond into a great game, but just not yet			"

												Imagine Sins of a Solar Empire, get rid of the engaging fleet battles (because they're automated in stellaris) and replace it with planets that have tiles that you have to manually add buildings too, and upgrade individually, a lot of bugs, and some rng to add frustration to boredom.You may be wondering about the diplomacy, sabotage, and other gameplay features you would expect to make up for an RTS/4x with lackluster combat, well they don't really exist in any relevant form. It doesn't matter if other empires like you, you can't effect them in any meaningful way outside of war.Build a big fleet, send it to the enemies systems(static defenses don't matter in this game just the biggest fleet wins, always) conquer 5 planets, end war, repeat 100 times, throw in an invasion of aliens outside of the galaxy toward the ""late game"" when you're about to quit out of boredom, (which are a moderate annoyance rather than an interesting feature) and that's it - that's the game.P.S. ethics divergence, species traits, ethos, etc. seem important, and that they might add depth, but they're mostly superficial IMO your empire is on rails to the end. your empire grows or you die. The customazition mainly increases a resource by x% and who you can be allies with, but again that doesn't matter because diplomacy doesn't matter. "

												It has potential, but many features need to be reworked or replaced. The resources are lacking: I spend far too much time trying to balance my influence rather than my budget. I do like the strategic resource system, however. The politcal system would be alright, but I find the 'mandates' annoying. I requently find myself with a president who promised to build more orbital research stations, but I've run out of sports to build them in. There's a nice, easy work around for this that solves my influence problems as well, but it feels like cheating and I just don't like that.I actually like the combat, but I wish the 'military power' would be more representative of a well balanced fleet, rather than the amount of damage each ship puts out (I exagerate, of course, there is more to it that that).This game has major staility issues running on OS X. It will crash every half hour. This needs to be fixed before I recommend this. I don't like games that I have to constantly save because I'm waiting for the next crash.TL;DR  This game has serious potential, but has too many balance issues and stability problems for me to recommend at this point.PS  Sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes			"

												This is without a doubt the most fun, most interesting, and most immersive space 4x game ever made, and has a lot of potential to become even better in future updates. Stellaris has nearly infinite replayability, incredibly immersive emergent storytelling, a vibrant modding community, and gives players a lot of choices in how they want to run their interstellar state. That being said, it's not really worth $40, so you're better off getting it and the DLC (Leviathans is the only DLC worth buying at the moment) while they're on sale. Additionally, the game isn't without its flaws, so I'll list a few here:-There are some pretty glaring bugs that aren't game-breaking or big issues, but the fact that they're there is pretty annoying.-In the classic Paradox fashion, the devs have made some truly bizarre and nonsensical gameplay decisions in the name of ""balance.""-Pirate bases (I mean the ones that exist from the start of the game, not the reasonable ones that are spawned through event later on) and space monsters (the Leviathans from the DLC are actually pretty cool, I mean the generic space monsters) aren't fun or challenging in any way, they're just frustrating to have to expend resources and time to deal with.-Diplomatic actions are kind of limited and arbitrary, and the diplomatic AI can be really stupid at times. Also, there still is no option for ""Federations"" to centralize into a single unified state, which you would think be their main selling point, but at current, Federations are just glorified unilateral alliances with a few bonus modifiers attached.-The galaxy settings are rather limited, and the largest map size feels far too small.-Mid/late-game crises are cool, but I wish they were more varied.-Massive empires are way too stable. Separatist factions only very very rarely actually succeed in seceding, governments stay in power for absurdly long periods of time, and there are no coups or civil wars. Adding more mechanics (and fixing ones that are already in place) to cause large states to easily fall apart the more massive and heterogeneous they get would go a long way towards making the game more dynamic and unpredictable.

												Really cool atmosphere, really cool ideas, this is a well done game in several aspects. In the end it completely screws up in too many ways to where it's a tedious grind. In the end I wish I did not buy this game at 25% off for $30.  So how does this game mess up? I will tell you about some things you need to look up:-War Score System: You have to declare up to a few planets as your goal, then after you take them you cannot fight the enemy empire in any way no matter what due to an end of war treaty that lasts 10 years. Basically you can be 1 planet shy of defeating an enemy and it gives them a 10 year cooldown.-The populations you conquer are never happy. NEVER. They will rebel. Destroy buildings. Production of their resources is cut in half if they even produce resources. The planet you just took is useless. This can be fixed with purging, but you must be a collectivist (communist) or xenophobic empire to do so and it will anger all other alien races at you. So if you want to conquer people you cannot make peace with anyone.-Even if you purge the populace and get a planet under control you cannot control more than 5 or so planets at a time. The game will then force a harsh penalty for governing so many planets. The only way to take away this penalty is to draw off sectors on a map and have all planets in that sector automated. This. Is. Stupid. You cannot build what you want,  the AI is incompetent, and upgrades and improvements to your planets just DO. NOT. HAPPEN. So basically for most governments you can have 5 planets you can control and once they are maxed out the rest of your planets have to be automated and turned into giant paperweights. -Needing influence to make frontier stations to expand borders just so you can mine empty planets with resources. Influence grows way too slowly for established planets. Your borders are literally static, and each frontier outpost puts a -1 modifier on your influence income. Influence is used for lots of things, so if you expand your borders guess what? You cannot afford new leaders and certain edicts like managing rebellious factions in your empire. Even some buildings cost influence. -The game in general punishes expansion and growth. Stellaris HARSHLY PUNISHES MILITARY CONQUEST. The devs literally are trying to force you to be peaceful with at least most of your neighbors or else you are stuck. Conquered planets are nigh useless with their native populations, you cannot bomb the populations to death from orbit and re-colonize it yourself, there is literally no friggin way to win with warfare in this game. There just isn't. The rebellious factions cause more issues than they are worth and demand to be returned to an empire you conquer and defeated 50 years ago. And the moment they have freedom? I declare war on them, steamroll them again with superior fleet, the whole rebellion until we get our freedom thing happens again. THIS IS VERY STUPID.  You can't even land armies to use as police units to ensure the populace at least let your buildings function. -Broken mechanics on planet control. You have major efficiency debuffs for having more than 5-7 planets pending government type. You split up planets you own into sectors then. How does this make sense forcing you to automate planets? You can take 20+ planets and make them into one giant sector under control of one governor and HE doesn't get any debuffs, does he? The devs intended for multiple sectors but the system is flawed and broken, especially since the AI controlled planets don't utilize resources properly. I cannot emphasize that enough, even if you order them to respect natural tile resources they ignore it and put down a lab. The sector hoards it's own resources seperate from you, too. So while a giant mega-sector can have more resources than you the guy in charge of the empire, you still have to buy ships and pay for maintenance on them. Make sense yet? Nope, never does never will. Summary: Broken mechanics were ripped from other Paradox games and shoehorned in, in a very awkward manner. There are even complaints from some long-time Paradox fans that some of the mechanics just don't make sense in this game. War score makes no sense in the galactic scale, might have worked for European wars in EU4 but that and all the other non-sense in Stellaris just makes no sense. It kills immersion and drags the game down in a bad way.There is a lot more wrong with this game. I might edit and update later, but in general this is not worth the effort. A fanboy will not get to this point before down-voting my review, so why keep explaining? There are many flaws to the logic in this game, from army transports all the way down to integrating aliens into your society. This is my first jump into a Paradox strategy game and I'm massively disappointed. Yes, they traded the icky historical theme for a cool sci-fi theme. That is a great step. But seriously, the devs put so many disincentives into the game that you are forced to play a certain way or else your empire will be crippled. We haven't had any good 4x space games since Space Empires 4 + 5. Stellaris did not fill that niche, in fact it's a pro-peace panzy ripoff of Distant Worlds. If you want 4x in RTS format get Distant Worlds: Universe instead. I know, the price sucks. There are rare sales, but it's worth full price. Stellaris loses compared to DW:U in every gameplay aspect.

												Overall a great game.Good graphics, great gameplay, can't wait for expansions already. I do feel like the endgame needs to be fleshed out more as it gets a bit stale and relies almost solely on the player to push the game to the end.I also encountered several bugs, such as not being able to get rid of the Prethoryn Swarm without using console commands to remove them from planets. This is not game-breaking necessarily, but it is rather annoying. "

												I am a big fan of 4X Space Games, and also of Paradox grand strategy titles. And I REALLY want to love and recommend this game, but I just can't. It's promising. I like the pausable real time aspects. Graphics are nice. And I like the various missions and events. But as it stands right now, the game is just not living up to Paradox standards.Most of the issues I have with the game are pretty well documented: - Sector AI is very poor. Doesn't seem to matter what you tell them to focus on, you end up with a pile of minerals of credits instead of the desired military or research. Plus, the AI seems to build colony installations that exceed available strategic resources. Balthorian power plants that don't have access to ore being common.- There is no diplomacy, for all intents and purposes.- There is no real strategy to fleet building or ship design. Because all the ships simply form up and attack in one big blob, once you design the best mix of weapons on the largest hull size available, you only need to build that ship. There is no funtional difference between ship sizes, so no need to design escorts once you get battleships. - No commerce, which eliminates a whole bunch of opportunity for interesting game dynamics.- The galactic crisis events are way over-powered, and can't even be turned off in the game settings.I expect these will all be addressed over time, through patches and DLC, but until I see some real improvement, I'll go try other games for a while and check back here in 6 months.

												While the early game was very fun and enjoyable, there exists a lack of interesting mechanics or well contextualized play in the mid-game, making that part an unbearable slog. While this is almost certainly going to be fixed with patches and DLC, I can't recommend the game in its current state.			"

												R.I.P. Galactic Civilizations; Stellaris is here. This game lives up to every promise, and is exquisite so far. I couldn't be happier!Having played Europa Universalis, EU II, and forcing myself to muddle my way through EU: Rome, EU III and EU IV, as well as Crusader Kings II, I'd become kind of disillusioned by Paradoxes hyper in-depth stretegy and convoluted interfaces; but holy hell did they knock Stellaris out of the park! The UI is incredibly well designed, the game is remarkably intuitive; so much so that I'd go so far as to call the manual optional. For Paradox, that's one hell of an achievement.I can't wait to see what kinds of (*cough* Star Wars *cough*) Steam Workshop content crops up for this game, and I know I'm going to be playing it for quite a long time.I'd go so far as to say that Stellaris is tied with Sins of a Solar Empire for my favorite Space Strategy game. Don't wait! You'll love it!			"

												I've never written a review before, for any game. I must say this game is a masterpeice. It combines the best elements of civilization, and sins of a solar empire, and manages to out do them both (to the extent that, that comparison is useful)The game is very rich, detailed, polished, engaging, and has extremly high replay value. I've only been playing a few months and I know I'll be playing it for years to come. This is the game that the 4x label was made for. I'm really wracking my brain to come up with some negative things but not doing very well. There are definitely some bugs and errors etc, but it seems like the game makers are very much involved and active, several patches/hotfixes/updates have came out in the relatively short time I've been playing, and the bugs I have encountered fall more on to the 'slightly annoying' side rather than 'game breaking', and most of the ones I've noticed have already been fixed since I picked up the game. If you are a fan of 4x games this is for you.seriously. ♥♥♥♥ing buy it.			"

												The usual Paradox attention to detail is in here in bucketloads.  On the surface it appears to be a simple space rts, but give it a few hours and the game opens up into something huge and exciting. The customisation options are impressive, the graphics are beautiful, the performance is as smooth as butter and the overall polish for a release day game is very high compared to what we are used to nowadays. Yes, it has a few things that could be improved in terms of information feedback and map overlays, but these in no way fully detract from what is a superb game. I am also excited about future dlc that Paradox will no doubt release to take this already addictive game to the next level.  And no, I'm not a Paradox fan boy who buys or supports dlc just for the sake of it. I simply don't mind paying for something that is worth it, and more often that not, Paradox deliver - simple as.On the whole, I would recommend this game to anyone with even the slightest interest in rts space games. It definitely has that ""one more turn"" ingredient similar to CK2 and EUIV and two play hours can easily turn into six in the blink of an eye - you have been warned :-)Buy it - you owe it to yourself to experience this.

												I have not done a review in a while so bare with me. So this game is perfect if you're a 4X or a Grand Strategy fan, because this game is a mix between the two, and I highly recommend this game, and besides, it's pricetag is not the usual $60, but it's actually $40. I'm not very good at explaining games, but I'll give you a little fun story from the game.So my science ship was surveying this system and, as it turns out, there was an industrial-age era civilization on one of the planets. This was perfect, since I already colonized a planet on a nearby system, so this planet is in my borders. These guys were the Graxna♥♥♥♥♥n civilization. I decided to send a construction ship there and build an observation post there so the my scinetists can passively study them. Fast-forward 10 years, and I'm in the middle of a war with a neighbor who was a xenophobic fanatic spiritualist, so they basically hate me since my empire is fanatic materialist, the opposite of spiritulist. Anyway, right after a huge battle where half of my ships were destroyed, I get an event of a level 4 class asteroid headed towards the Graxna♥♥♥♥♥n planet. Normally, I would've sent my ships to destroy the asteroid, but my ships were heavily damaged and there was an enemy navy in a system right next to my home system, so I couldn't just go there and destroy it, because then the enemy would attack the capital. Basically, I watched the asteroid slowly encroach on the doomed planet, and the beautiful, jungle planet became a desolate, barren planet, and also got some rings now, like Saturn's rings.I just watched an entire civilization disappear like that in front of my eyes and I didn't even do anything. For a few minutes, I felt bad for them. But hey, that's Stellaris, and maybe you'll get an awesome story to tell someone someday.			"

Posted: May 10, 2016
												Unfortunately, the game is weak. Already played through on hardest and managed to dominate the AI while making numerous errors and being essentially stuck and unable to colonize in the early mid-game. I was hoping for a EUIV in space. You have a force-limit, you have to have a CB to attack regions of space etc. etc. This game is like every other 4X game. In-fact it is a step back to something like the still unsurpassed Distant Worlds for the sake of this review I am going to compare it to such:edit: Finally ran into all of the BUGS: I have had the AI send a 5k stack of ships one at a time instead of a fleet across my sector. I have zoomed into a fight and then zoomed out to the map only to have a destroyed battleship replace the stars in the background as well as numerous graphical glitches. The save/load broke where when I loaded a game it would take me to empty space with nothing in it, losing me hours of progress. I have had a fleet stuck, unable to decide between two starbase on which one to attack and just flying in circles. Not to mention that wormholes are broken with allies. - The world is lifeless. Distant worlds had a public and a private sector so you could see public sector ships flying through space, grabbing resources and hauling them back to the colony. None of that here. You build a science or mineral outpost and thats it. - The ship building is also useless. The modules are boring as all hell: you just have laser I then 2 etc. Why even customize the ships. In distant worlds, you had complete freedom to add modules to the ship up to their limit. You could make ships as small or as large as you like. Star Drive also had an inovative system where you can places modules on a grid. Even Gal Civ 4 allowed you to customize the look of the ships. - Colony management is still in the dark ages: Blockers!? Adjecency bonuses. These are all tired, worn concepts. Dumping everything into sectors just to get rid of the tedium is not a solution! Sectors should be the primary means of control, not systems.  - Diplomacy, what diplomacy: On Hard and up, it is extremely difficult to get alliances or form federations so that mechanic is all but wiped out. Federation 10 year time, puff puff pass mechanic, is silly anyway. They built a game like CK2 where you could have a family, a lineage, gain and lose huge regions of land in one generation and here we are back with the staid governors etc. What a waste. (protip: Built massive amounts of mineral resources. Don't focus on energy. Befriend another empire who also gets massive energy reserves that they do not use and keep trading minerals for energy and win. Pro-er tip: you cannot run into debt so in the end retool everything to minerals and WIN with your massive 200k Doom stacks. Energy maintenance, WTF is that. I used the red shard tech as my only offensive tech and won. Battleship? More like here comes 50 corvettes up your♥♥♥♥♥ all evading your shots.) The game is broken as is. But maybe in some magical future world, Paradox carves it into a gem. I live in the present. I don't live in the ""What if they..."" -Distant worlds you could get creamed by pirates, massive alliances, late game invasions. Here, you have terrible Ai to deal with who never attack you as well as a few roaming monsters that do nothing until you attack them.It gets worse: If the AI were to become super agressive, you would be all but wiped out because of the bonuses they receive. I have a feeling this is why you are never engaged. It would make the game unplayable on harder difficulties. Edit: The AI is even worse than I thought, which explains their passive nature: My vassel was declared on by a large empire. They took ages to finally move their superior fleet into my territory, while I huddled my ships in a corner, waiting for the end. They proceeded to attack my home world, destroy the station, then they !split! their fleet with one half buggering off to some distant corner of my empire and the other being immediately ambushed by my fleet and destroyed. A further note: while most 4X titles have some kind of limitation on the range of your ships i.e. Distant Worlds has fuel, this game allows you to just hop to ends of the universe. Effectively making wars highly one-sided with no ability to recover as you never have to retreat your forces from enemy territory. You destroy all their starbases and win. Distances are too long, fleets take too long to rebuilt. Wars are unrecoverable.   -Micromanagement is from the dark ages here. In Distant Worlds, you can automate everything or nothing. It is up to you, yet here in 2016, in Stellaris, I cannot assign production orders (edit: I want to stress how insane this oversight is: when you queue up two ships for instance, resources are deducted for both! Even though only one is being built. If you are attacked, you can simply cancel and receive all of your resources back even if the ship is 98% built WTF paradox! That's programming year one!) to stations or rally points! I have no control over my fleets in battle so I sit and watch as they spread damage over the entire enemy force instead of focus firing. WORST OF ALL: I cannot automate the GODDAM science and construction vessels. I have to shift click every single debris research in a sector of my god are you kidding me.Overall: The game is clearly unfinished. This is a bare shell, wich might hopefully be filled by future development, but do not buy it yet. Wait until it is patched severely and content is added. This is another in a long string of dissapointing 4X titles. You can do better Paradox. This is a space 4X game and I have already beaten it on the hardest difficulty. That is saying something,Edit: The positives: I did have a very cool moment where my race became so populace that when I declared war on the once mighty bird people, I find that their leader is a member of my race, having presumably stabbed his way to leaderhood. I have to admit that that was a new one. Never saw that before in any 4X.			"

												Early game is great, but when you've played the early game 2-3 times and realise it's the same every time. Not so great.AI for Sectors needs work.The UI is horrible for making informed decisionsIf you are going to research blockers you need to know how many blockers of that type is affecting you. Going trough each planet one by one is not an optionCombat is strange since ships just go full frontal assault even though they have ranged weaponsthe list goes on...This might become a good game by the end of the year but then there is something else to play.

												Insanely fun game. Its a slow game but you feel like you don't necessarily have enough time to do what you want to do. You constantly have to choose between resources and what to spend them on. The ""small"" universes have 100 solar systems and take days to complete. This game manages to keep you at a strategic level with micromanagement minimized to a perfection. From the time I have played it seems to have a lot of replaybilty, not only because games will take days to complete but everything from what I have seen is procedurally built. You are not going to have the same game twice, they might be similar but one time you might start in a resource poor solar system all alone and your fighting to just survive, the next time your in a solar system that is rich in resources and eveyone wants to get you. Even the tech tree has randomness to it, not to the extent of you have no idea what you will unlock but it seems that once you research 1 item it unlocks a few from the next level, this prevents you from knowing the future.

												Let's get awesome (c) Emperor AwesomeMy inner fangirl keep screaming all night. Maybe this will be changed later, but on the first glance game is awesome.Yes, it less scientific then MoO3 but more deep then MoO2 and it's clones. The core thing in this game - Paradoxes remove the great curse of ""grabbing every flying rock on your way"". In the Stellaris Universe only few planets can support life, so out of dozen close systems I got only 3 good (including homeworld) and one arctic planets. Well, this game is a good successor of Star Trek and I would like to see Star Trek mod on it, or even DLC.Gameplay is simple and well-known to the paradox fans:- pausable real-time;- indirect battles;- ""city""-building; - weird diplomacy;- mini-quests;- great leaders;- some science.They just added some space systems, old empires and ship builder. So it's a solid 4x, worth to buy. Just remember - it's Paradox, they will make a lots of DLC in order to make this game even better (and get a lot of money for that).			"

												I've now around 33 hours in the game and I can proudly say that this game is a very good game.I'm doing a campaign with friends now and we're having loads of fun talking about the exploration, anomalies and the things we do in general.I recommend this game because PDS did a good job with the sector management, Empire creator, the galaxy shape, size and how many AI Empires are present. A thing to note is that the events content changes regarding to what your Ethics are which is a very nice addition so you don't have to read the same all the time when you play another campaign.The trade and diplomacy needs some work however but it's not a big let down for the game itself as I'm still enjoying it 100% since the first minute I played it.

												I don't often write reviews for games. This game has compelled me to do so. What an absolutely fantastic game it is. I have never been much of a 4x player or a grand strategy fan in the past, but something told me to pick this one up. Man am I glad I did. Stellaris really captures the feel of role playing a galactic empire. From the ethics and traits, to diplomacy and trade. To combat and wars. Each game takes hours and hours to complete. I'm currently on my 14th hour of the current game and have plenty more to go.The fact that you can completely customize your starting race, complete with ethics and traits, and the fact that AI species are all completely randomly generated is what makes this really shine. Also, you can design your own ships with the technology you have researched. Awesome idea.The only thing that has bugged me a bit, is the UI needs an overhaul. There are many areas where efficiency can really be improved when managing a lot of fleets and planets.If you're a fan of space, and feel like ruling the galaxy, pick this game up. With improvements and DLC over time, this might be one of the greatest space games ever made.9.5/10			"

												It's a pretty game, but very one dimensional for what is supposed to be the next generation of the 4x genre. World building and alien negotiations lack any sort of depth. The creation of sectors comes off as a half-hearted stab at complexity, but likewise falls flat, as do many of the other minor nuisances that end up being more annoying than value adding features. Most people seem to agree that this game will be refined over the lifespan of the game, but for $30 there's really no excuse for its current state or the trickle DLC ($$$) through which necessary features are disseminated.As of the moment, Stellaris survives on user created content, not on it's own merits. It tries to an RTS and a 4X simultaneously but never manages to rise above mediocrity without the help of modding community.			"

												Stellaris Review as of 10/18/2016....- Establsh Unified Earth Government- Establish United Nations Space Command- Go forth amongst the stars, begin exploring and colonizing profitable and habitable planets in the name of humanity.- 50 years later run into another species, they look like squid people, not initially hostile, give them a chance.- 10 years later ""squiddies"" are encroaching on my borders, they ask I give them one of my best planets or suffer consequences, I tell them to **** OFF.- 5 years later ""squiddies"" inhabit a world right on the edge of my space and start pushing my area of influence back, trying to covertly infiltrate my planet they wanted me to give them, NOT TODAY! I insititue new edicts and retain control of my planet while exploring others and ganing more powerful ships and weaponry.- 8 years later, another race shows up, these guys look like giant lizards and are religious fanatics, they hate me and threaten me on first contact, I tell them to go blow their Gods.- 10 years later, my UNSC controlled territory spans over 18 stars, 4 planets colonized, and my fleet is well assembled with frigates and cruisers, get a message that the ""squiddies"" and ""lizard♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; have formed an alliance, we call it their ""covenant"", this can't be good news.- 3 years later, this ""covenant"" says they have had enough of me, and declare war on me.... HAHAHAHAHA I just finished researching highly advanced magnetic accelerator cannons, this should be interesting...- months later.... I have lost half of my fleet, but killed 2x as many, thankfully we have basic shileds, they are using laser based weapons that melt our hull armor, but if we can hold our borders for at least 10 years I will have a nice surprise for them!- 5 years later.... we have lost 2 planets and its not looking good, new tech is helping but my ""secret weapon"" is not yet ready, only a few years left.... gotta hold out- 4 years later.... just deployed my ""secret weapon"", the UNSC Infinity, a super capital ship killer with all of the latest and greatest technological achievements. UNSC Infinity joins up with Task Force Aegis, this is my largest and best equipped fleet to date, time for some payback!- 2 1/2 months later.... 2 differnt enemy fleets incoming on Altair Prime, Task Force Aegis is already en-route through slipspace (hyperspace), MOLON LABE MOTHER*****S!- Battle Report..... UNSC Infinity taking light damage to shields, 16 enemy ships obliterated, no surviors.... BLUFOR losses at 23,000 souls across 6 ships, we are doing well. Engaging enemy super capital with new CR8 Series MAC's, never used them before, eggheads warn of massive destruction potential, **** it give them all 4 guns worth.... enemy super capital ship is literally shattered into a million fragments, I LOVE THIS SHIP! The last few enemies have decided to retreat to save their scaly ***es, GO AHEAD AND RUN, YOU WILL ONLY DIE TIRED!- 10 years later.... I am now on the offensive, just lifted the planetary bombardment restrictions to NO RESTRICTION. I begin to glass my enemies planets with absolute impunity, no survivors allowed. Watch with an elated sense of satisfaction as I watch my enemies die horrifically to my new Matter-Antimatter missles and massive magnetic acclerator cannons. TBH kind of smells like calamari.... anyone got tomato sauce?- 3 years laters... ""The Covenant"" want a peace treaty, they shall have peace, IN DEATH, I glass both of their homeworlds and claim all of their systems in the name of humanity! Bonus is that stupid ""squiddies"" make for an excellent meal, where is that damn tomato sauce?- 80 years later.... My area of Galactic control spans over 100 star systems and 10 planets colonized with TRILLIONS of people.... Intelligence community warns of impending attack from unknown threat outside of our galaxy, they report systems going ""dark"" within days of initial attack, probe data inconclusive, great more space ****heads.- 5 years later.... Intelligence confirms the attackers are a bug like species, all attempts at communication have failed, they are heading right for our systems crushing other smaller species we never cared about in mere months, they wash over them like a ""flood"", this is what we have named their species ""the flood"", time to go to war again it seems, yet this sounds oddly familiar.9.25/10 Would eat squid people and make HALO great again!I have to say that Stellaris is one of my favorite space RTS games I have ever played. Extremely moddable, easy to use interface system, and lots of ship customization. Soundtrack is also quite good, as are many of the visuals, which of course can easily be enhanced for free through the Steam Workshop. If you liked Homeworld or Sins of a Solar Empire you will probably like this game.Scoring:Gameplay: 9.5/10Visuals: 8/10Sounds: 8/10Soundtrack: 10/10Modding Support: 10/10Overall Score: 9.25/10*Note I do have my game modded so I can use UNSC ships and such, this is the reasoning behind my ""short story""			"

												Looking at my hours on the game, you couldn't possibly treat this review as one that carries great depth. But I could not honestly play past 2 hours per session, out of sheer boredom. This review will explain why to all the people who dismiss me as being too attached to EU4. 1. The economy mechanics. They are boring, nonintuitive, clicky, nondynamic, and simple- in a bad way. The system is based off of buildings you make which give you a flat increase of income a turn. Personally, this ""+1 plot"" system is not what I expected from Paradox. Paradox has been known for their complex economic systems- Trade in EU4, Production in Victoria and HOI, and feudal taxes in Crusader Kings. Seeing that Stellaris doesn't even have a trade mechanic, which I feel is a lost opportunity here, when dynamic trade nodes would be *such* a great addition to the game. Instead, they decide to completely remove one of the greatest features of a Grand Strategy game in this '4x/Grand Strategy hybrid' under the justification of 'keeping it simple'. I would argue that there is a difference between keeping it simple, and not even including an important mechanic. 2.The warfare mechanics.They are boring, nonintuitive, spamfesty, and carry very little player interaction. ""Designing your own ships"" is about as useful or rewarding as adding a paper sticker onto a cup and calling it a 'design'; it has little to no impact on anything, as the game already appears to have the most proficient design ready for you anyway. Not that designs really make a difference either, as the battle is based on sheer numbers; mainly two. Armor, and armor penetration. There is no maneuvering going on here, there is no composition or 'specialization' that is effective here. I cannot heavily comment on this personally, but I do believe that even those who enjoy this game criticise the warfare mechanics.3. The Diplomacy mechanics.Nonexistant. Besides the cosmetics, the diplomacy mechanics are only *just a tad better* than civilization's. I'll just quote the Wiki on the features:-Establishing an embassy to improve relations with an AI nation (embassies have no effect in a multiplayer game if established between two human players)-Sending an insult to reduce relations-Offering an alliance (a strong alliance with 4 or more participants may become a Federation)-Offering a trade agreement (trade agreements can include non-aggression pacts, map-sharing, resources, research access, -border access, and migration between nations)-Demanding a weaker AI enemy becomes your vassal-Declaring war-Declaring another nation your rival (resulting in both parties gaining Influence)Simplistic, alright.4. DLC PlatformI will never understand how people will conform to companies shoving out such a minimal game and charging full price for it on the grounds that 'they'll fill out the holes with expansions later!'. People should not allow themselves to be continuously abused with DLC containing content that should have been in the base game. "

												At the moment, Stellaris early game is great and mid-game is OK, but end-game is very shallow and a horrible grind.They would need to address two issues for fixing the end-game: victory conditions and annexation costs.Currently, there are two victory conditions: own 60% of COLONIZABLE planets (as in, you need to have at least 60% of the map conquered and then colonize every planet possible, a horrendous chore that only the most autistic of us could ever complete), or vassalize all other empires (which are not Fallen Empires), which may seem simple if you choose to have few other empires in the galaxy, but keep in mind that even so, other empires emerge from either newly-advanced species or empires splitting into multiple factions. Therefore, winning the game is a very boring grind.Annexing planets over a war is very costly in war score. I don't think you're able to annex more than maximum of 5 at a time (but it's usually less because more developed planets have higher war score costs), no matter the size of your empire. If you're fighting against an empire with, let's say, 100 planets, that's 20 wars. Good luck, chap. Oh, and if you think about diplomatically annexing a vassal, the time needed scales very highly with the number of planets of the vassal empire, meaning that if you are a huge blob and want to annex a smaller, but still large blob, it will take hundreds, if not thousands, of years - meanwhile crippling your Influence resource income, which is very hard to get by anyway, so you won't be able to do more than one annexation at a time anyway. You'll notice that nowhere have I stated that there is a victory condition that allows Federations to win, as in, tough luck getting a shared win with your buddies.Now, there might be some sort of differing gaming philosophy but I enjoy playing a game to its end. Paradox games have a knack of making themselves horribly dull before that, trying to bore the players into renouncing the current game and restarting again and again and again. If you're into getting into a game that you KNOW you'll have a Chinese farmer finishing the end-game for you, or you don't care about finishing at all, go ahead. I just think that, currently, Stellaris is 20 DLCs and at least a couple more victory conditions away from being entertaining on the long run.			"

												SEVERLY lacking depth as a 4x game. Expecially compared to Distant Worlds. Without comparing the two. The first few hours is just scanning sectors over and over again with the same rotating events every game, then it turns into diplomacy which is SEVERLY lacking depth. With Paradox being the company, and seeing how CK2 and EU4 plays, I'm actually very suprised that it's VERY shallow. The technology tree is pretty cool. The idea surrounding the game is AWESOME. It' just lacks depth, and the implementation is just not there for me.			"

												TL;DR: It's a no for now, but worth keeping an eye on to see what it becomes. Stellaris simply feels empty at this point. I stopped playing for a few months, just recently came back once Leviathans released to give it another try. Played for a few hours with some mods and still feel the same. The first few hours are fun and exciting as you go about exploring and slowly building. However after your first colonies are finished and you have a small empire building up, everything becomes boring. Everything becomes a routine. Diplomacy dosen't really exist. War feels one sided, whether for or against you depends on the situation. Everything feels somewhat like a grind with no real end objective. The mid-game especially feels lacking in anything to keep me interested. This all sounds negative, but the game does have potential. The early game- exploring, colonizing and meeting the first alien civilizations other than your own- is exciting and fun. Late game seems to have interesting events as well, but I haven't personally seen any. This game has potential. Maybe after a year or so of patches and DLC (unfortunetly Paradox games usually have a mountain of DLC but they also usually make them game better) this can be a great game. Right now though there simpily is not enough in the game to keep you hooked and playing like games such as CK2 or EUIV.			"

												It's getting pretty good after 3 patches. Still a few bugs, and it's not quite cooked yet, but it's getting there. Still needs some balancing, especially the endgame crises that went from minor inconveniences to almost unbeatable juggernauts of doom in 1.3.So, git gud or git eaten by a monstruosity from outer space.One awesome side of that game is that you can make pretty much any sci-fi faction you can think of, thanks to a flexible system of traits and ethos that allow you to create hundreds of different empires. Whether you want to play a race from Mass Effect, the Culture, Farscape's Peacekeepers, the Imperium of Man or any combination of space-faring entities you like, the game has you covered.There's also a very active mod community, if you want to tune the gameplay or play a race with their actual portraits. Finally, there are dozens of shout-outs to every sci-fi fiction out there through events and descriptions. You can research psi techs and make your own Jedis, you can collect a Dune's spice equivalent and make your own Navigator's Guild, etc.If you like sci-fi, 4X games and roleplaying, or any combination thereof, it's definitely a game you should check.

												Stellaris is a great game with countless little things to explore or which simply happen. But not for everyone.Many approaches to the game adapted in games I played like Civ 1-5, Master of Orion 1-4, Sins of a solar Empire, Age of empires, Starcraft, Alpha Centauri, etc. are just ..... completely different. In Stellaris you spend many hours in a very small explored place in a huge unexplored galaxy full of aliens. In Battles you set goals, like capture a single Planet, you dont build a massive Army and roll over the map. So one race of many looses one or few planets, you still do not know whats happening on the several hundred other stars.There are lots of little details, hundreds of nice text infos when you research a relict from the past or certain aliens. In Stellaris you see a single population unit who is much less productive than the others. Investigating shows it believes in xeophobic militaristics. Playing a peaceful and individualistic race it is unhappy. As soon as you make migration deals with aliens who have this belief, you will see this unit packing stuff and leaving your government. On the other side, alien people with similar belief of your basic race begins to settle on your worlds.And your experience of Stellaris will be different, depending on how you handle such things. If you just click on the close button of these stupid text windows because you have not much influence on the content and few ressource changes does not interest you. If you are the kind of player in MMORPGs who accepts all quests without reading and afterwards killing random stuff until accidently some quests are solved, then Stellaris might not be your game.In above Example you can be amazed by this migration feature. On the other hand you might say ""I do not care if its a bird or a mushroom who works on this tile. I do not even know or care why it has changed""Like in civ and moo, the races have nearly the same game mechanic, but there are a lot of different optics.The battles are realtime and it depends on your technic level and simply the size of the fleet who wins. The Admiral assigned to it gives a little bonus on some stuff. The tactic aspects are where to build defence lines with defence platforms which are much cheaper than ships with the same fire power. And to clever pick the fight against the main fleet of the opponent (with the goal to minimize own casualities)If you want turn based, tactic battles like battle isle you will not find them here.After many hours played I am far from the endgame so I can not say much about it.What I can say is that I had a lot of fun playing the game this far and even if I would stop playing it, it already gave me lots of fun for the price paid. So, the fun/money relation for me results in a clear recommendation to buy this game.I am no native speaker so please be kind :-) "

												Unfortunately, Stellaris is at once deeply flawed and obviously incomplete. Drawing lines between the two is not so simple a task.The centerpiece of its mechanical and conceptual failings is its Sector AI system. In the broadest of terms, this is a ""friendly"" AI component that, in any reasonably-successful playthrough, you must use, on pain of crippling penalties to your empire's efficacy. And it is terrible.The ability of the human player to give it instructions is severely limited, and, even within those limitations, the Sector AI is belligerent and stupid. But let me be clear: those limitations themselves are crippling and unreasonable, and speak to deep conceptual flaws with the game. Sectors are created by linking multiple star systems together, and those star systems must be ""next to"" each other according to the game. Thus, Sectors are a geographical organizational method. The trouble is, virtually nothing else about internal empire management is about geography. One system might contain two planets that the player will want to specialize in very different ways - and, indeed, might be encouraged to specialize in different ways by the presence of planet-specific bonuses or penalties (e.g., lower food output, higher mineral output, more research, less happy population.) But a Sector can only be told to focus on one broad area of development. So, even if your Sector is comprised of a single system, it still could be wholly incapable of coming even remotely close to doing what any middling player would know to do... and all of this is assuming it could even follow limited instructions properly. But it can't. It cannot develop new planets even close to ideally. It cannot construct (or refrain from constructing) spaceports ideally. It cannot manage population units on planets' tile-squares effectively. While I'm sure it does many things right, it does so many immediately-obvious things wrong so often that the well is thoroughly poisoned. No partial credit for building a car that goes really fast but explodes and kills all its passengers.Other game systems suffer similar deep conceptual issues, but nothing quite so severe as the Sector fiasco. Sadly, the Sector fiasco has tentacles that go everywhere. But still: ship design isn't well-thought-out, even after a balance pass in 1.1. Weapon balance is not up to snuff, which includes the balancing of various defenses. The method by which wars' successes/failures are tallied and weighted is horribly flawed. Diplomacy is, much like the whole game, both flawed and incomplete. Espionage does not exist.As many other reviews have stated, Stellaris's unique flavor - fueled by ""events"" that trigger occasionally on their own, or are more often discovered via scanning new planets in new systems - is loaded up into the early game, leaving the middle-game and the endgame incredibly barren. When a player gets to mid-game, all at once they are confronted by an omnipresent ""friendly"" AI that is behaving inexcusably badly, and a lack of anything else to do except to pick a war to fight, grab more territory, and slowly crawl their way to a hollow galactic domination that barely feels earned, let alone alive.I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. On its own terms, it is a failure that feels rushed, incomplete, and poorly-conceived in many areas all the way back to the drawing board phase. If I were to raise the bar and judge it on my terms, it would fare even worse.			"

												It's fun to play for a while but Stellaris is a bit simple and shallow experience. There a just not enough in depth game mechanics. It's all about getting to the next higher number. They probably going to sell a lot of DLC's to make it (for me at least) a better experience in the long run. For now the game is just to expensive for what it has to offer.			"

												Two words coming to mind are wasted potential. One might thing EA released this, because it's horrendously buggy and unbalanced. As it is right now, it ends up unplayable sooner or later along the game always. Maybe, with some serious patching, it'll become better.There is hope. Much of the engine is clear and usable, the groundwork is generally well done, you get a cozy environment in your galaxy with a lot to tweak, options to do more or less of that yourself, many ways to go. The UI gives mixed feelings, some things are very clear but others are just catastrophically stupid, causing dozens of extra clicks for simple matters. A number of bugs will cause a lot of game restarts, with blank windows filling the screen or clicks stopping to register every now and then. The balance of resources feels mostly good, and I'm guessing constantly running out of energy is more due to lack of my gameplay skills. It makes sense to have some lack of resources, so you'll actually need to balance it. Strategy games tend to be too easy in this regard, so I consider this a better option.The AI. That's where it all falls down. Even if you set the AI to passive, what it means is excessively aggressive. If you get a late game event with really bad guys taking over the galaxy, the AI empires just ignore them and try to fight you twice as hard when you're supposed to be saving the galaxy on your own. There's a lot of other illogicals in the AI behaviour, which simply make the gameplay extremely frustrating. And when I say extremely, I mean ""this monitor's going out the window"" level of frustrating. There's just no balance and no sense. It's hard to make it perfect, I've seen that with way too many thousands of hours in strategy games, but this is not ""slightly untweaked"", it's a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor job. Unfortunately. Give us an easier way to manage all spaceports, give us a more balanced AI and wouldn't be a bad idea to add a beginner friendly difficulty level to get you started at first. The first gameplays ended way too quickly with a massively overwhelming attack by... well, everyone. Make love not war, you know?To sum it up: close to unplayable now due to bugs, UI frustration and mostly AI problems, but with a LOT of hard work, that might change. I dearly hope that happens. I would like to play this game. Should further patches change it, I will gladly change my opinion.			"

												Played a Paradox game on / off for a short while, but generally was put off by the overly complex systems and hard to learn tutorials. This game gripped me from the beginning though, I love space/sci-fi so that obviously helped, but the tutorial is friendly and unobtrusive, and gives you missions to complete that ease you into learning the game. The customization is incredibly varied and deep, and the random events pull from all your customizations creating an emergent narrative that connects you to your fleets, admirals, leaders and more. It'd be nice to have a little more control when it comes to combat, and more possibilities when it comes to other races and colonization, but generally I've enjoyed all the tools at my disposal so far. I haven't experienced much of the end game yet, but for early and mid game, it's been extremely fun, highly recommended.			"

												This game is boring. Very boring.You start off exploring the galaxy and that part is fun. But, fairly soon, you've finished that part of the game and you're into the part of the game where you're developing your star civilization. And there's nothing to do there. You get to make meaningless choices between technologies with futuristic-sounding names, and watch the AI develop the planets that you've colonized. And this goes on for hours and hours and hours. I've read that there's an epic war at the end of the game, but I've only played the game for about 100 hours, I haven't got that far yet.There's a tile development mini-game within a game, as is traditional for Civilization-like games, but the developers decided to force you to let the AI do that for you. I don't know why the game's designers bothered to code this mini-game if they weren't going to let the players play it.Wars with the AI are boring. You don't fight the battles yourself - that's all handled by the AI. You move your star ship fleets around on the map, trying to bring the AI to battle on your terms. If your fleet is bigger, chances are that'll be relatively easy. Then you get to watch the AI for your fleet ROFLstomp the AI for the AI's fleet. It's pretty the first few times, but after a while it gets old.In fairness, the developers have said that there's a whole bunch of mid-game events that they didn't have time to code before releasing the game. They've said they expect to get that code added to the game by the end of June. We'll see. But in the meantime, if you like watching the AI play against itself, this is the game for you.			"

												I decided that my first Stellaris playthough would be on Ironman mode , with no prior knowledge of the game whatsoever. What follows is three of the most interesting points in a campaign that has thus far spanned 180 years.Background:I named my empire ""The Galactic Empire"" and began the game as a militarist, materialist, and authoritarian.The Celimy Conflict:Early on, around the 50 year mark, I encounter a species of strange, fungal creatures. They call themselves the ""Celimy States"". They are fanatic spiritualists and pacifists. Fools.After a series of insults and the declaration of a rivalry, the Celimy declare war on me.My navy, christened the ""Grand Imperial Navy"", departs the Coruscant System to engage the Celimy ""Mycelium Carriers"", as they called themselves.A short time later, the Imperial Navy reaches the Celimy home system. Imperial transport land armies on their capital.The takeover is rapid, and at the end of the war the Celimy States has splintered into 3 separate nations: The Celimy hegemony, the Celimy Confederacy and the Celimy Associates. Later on, the Associates would become my vassal. The Confederacy was a long standing enemy.The Galactic Civil War:Around 120 years in, the galaxy is almost fully filled with about 20 separate empires, and two distinct sides begin to form.On one side is myself and a federation called the ""Stellar Entente"", along with various other small empires.The other side is comprised of a vast array of small nations, led by the ""Karabnar Nations"".War breaks out, with the Karabnar declaring war on the Galactic Empire.I now have 3 fleets: The Star Corps, the Shock Battalion, and the Grand Imperial Navy. The Star Corps and Shock Battalion are relatively small shock forces, whereas the Grand Imperial Navy is my main force.A massive space battle in the Ocheron system involves over 1000 ships, with almost every known nation being present.The battle (which was beautiful to watch) was relatively even until the arrival of the Star Corps and Shock Battalion, who tipped the balance with fresh ships.The combined fleet of myself and my allies (yes, the AI is THAT good) eventually reaches Karab, the Karabnar Nations capital, and takes the system with the help of two Titanic Beasts recruited from the outer systems of the Empire.On the verge of victory, I am notified that a massive fleet is currently in orbit over Coruscant. Sent by the Hjaarthi Syndicate, one of our enemies, the fleet is in position to take our homeworld. My own fleets cannot reach Coruscant in time. All seems lost.A mere few days before Coruscant's fortifications would've failed, a fleet from one of my allies, the Verulian Compact, comes out of hyperspace above Coruscant and annihlates the enemy fleet.The Karabnar Nation and their allies surrender, and the war is won.The Fallen Empire (150 years in):A fallen empire (which is a fully developed but stagnant state) exists above me. They call themselves the Yz'Vorak Remnant (which I shortened to Y Remnant).They are military isolationists, and hate my empire with a special intensity.They insult mea and shortly afterwards declare war on my empire. This sort of war is usually a death sentence, so I move large numbers of people away from the Frontier and prepare to submit.At this point I've got 3 vassals. All are weak, but they are extremely loyal. The vassals join me in the war.All 3 of my fleets meet above Coruscant, along with Transports for my Droid Army (Irony, much)I deploy my entire military to the Jahab system, where we meet the Fallen Empire's forces.Their ships are unlike anything we've ever seen, and are incredibly powerful. We are losing the battle. Things are not looking good.Suddenly, out of hyperspace, come 3 fleets; my 3 vassals have brought everything they have to assist the effort. With their help, we drive back the Fallen Empire forces.Fastforward about 3 years.Through intense naval strategy and economic strain, Imperial forces have out matched the Y Remnant's fleet. The Grand Imperial Navy and the fleets of my vassals orbit above their capital: The Core.I don't have enough strength left to invade their planets, so I offer them a white peace.Fallen Empires cannot build new fleets, so this seemed logical enough.I recieve a notification:""Peace Accords on Coruscant""While signing the peace accords on Coruscant, two V Remnant agents who were standing next to the Emperor (of the Galactic Empire) killed him and mutilated his body.Furious, the Imperial Navy and the combined fleets of all of the Empire's vassals and allies immediately attack the Y Remnant Capital.Out of nowhere, a massive army from the Fallen Empire comes out of hyperspace over The Core (I still am not entirely sure where this army actually came from).In the epic battle that ensues, the Grand Imperial Navy defeats and destroys the Y Remnant's fleet, allowing the ground invasion of The Core to take place.With The Core fallen, the Fallen Empire cowers and begs for peace.The Y Remnant is annexed by the Galactic Empire.Peace reigns across the galaxy.Around 20 years later...Subspace energy surges indicate something we have not encountered before. A new being from out of our dimension makes contact. Their signal is not unlike a hunting call.....			"

												I'm going cut my review short for people doesn't like reading much details. Stellaris just needs much more polishing like every other core Paradox game, since Paradox loves selling their supposed to be given in original game parts by dlcs. Aside from that, it is at the same level of any other core Paradox games released since the release of Crusader Kings 2, which means it is a decent game for now.			"

												Update:While Stellaris looks great and promises a lot, it feels like a game that is still in development, with a lot of its content missing. A early access game. Something that is only emphasized by the huge 1.1 patch. I don't know if its intentional or if its just not play-tested right but things really seem to be missing. The game is just a bit boring and bland.I would wait a while to see how it improves and then get it at a discount.- No real differences in races- No tactics- Boring warfare (especially lategame)- Brain-dead governorsDetails below- No real differences in races: Its mostly visual. Your race's ethos will define how you play as it defines most of your policies. Choosing different policies during the game is either heavily penalized or simple not an option.- No tactics: There are almost no tactics. The only thing that really matters is your powerscore. - Boring warfare: Is your fleet's Powerscore bigger then your opponent; Declare War. If not? Build more.- Brain-dead governors: Creating sectors to manage your other planets sounds great but is not working. Planets remain unattended and build/improve nothing at all.			"

												This is really a great game, I waited till it was on sale because of some negative reviews and I kind of wished I hadn't.  It's that good, I wish the dev would have got full price.  It's a plot driven, real time, space civilization, 4x, massive single player experience. Unless of course you're playing on line but then it's not ""massive"" in the traditional gaming sense. I failed to engage in CKII as much as I have this game but I'm sure to want to go back and check it out again after playing with this one as much.  It's not to say this game is perfect by any means.  Even a perfect 10 has room for improvement.  This game however has yet to provide me with anything like a same game/start in the 7 or 10 game's I've played.  The learning curve is highish, but not as high as crusader kings. Do your self a favor and buy this game, sale or not. This is a deeply rewarding gameplay experience.			"

												So the new DLC they released for 1/4th of the base games price? Yeah...they were in early previews of the game before it was released. Actually, the files for them were already in the base game when it was released. What the crap paradox? When I first started playing these games, I pirated EU2. I loved it so much I bought EU3,Eu4,Stellaris, that other one that is all political and crap that i never even played, countless DLC's. Just to support this developer. I just cant do that anymore, I even got a ton of my friends to buy the games as well! Im done with you Paradox, hope your dlc policy works out for you. The game is ok, but they are going to milk you for every cent they can for years to come. And to those that think ""I dont have to buy the dlc lol"", look at EU$. The game is practically unplayable without a few of the DLC's and I am sure that will be the case here as well.Just another case of one of the few good developers left turning to crap.			"

												Like all Paradox games, it has had a good start with a strong foundation to be improved upon, or in some cases torn down and rebuilt after player feedback.Even though I suck at designing ships, I am having a blast with Stellaris in all my playthroughs.My only complaint is naturally that the Sector AI needs a lot of work in regards to managing slaves, robots, and resource management. Paradox has stated that they are working on it, and coming patches and DLCs have me excited for the Sector AIs improvement!			"

												Well no - it's definitely not 6.3 and ♥♥♥♥ you IGN once again.At it's current state the game is playable albeit very unpolished. It is very similar to Europa Universalis or Hearts of Iron and unfortunately is rife with micromanagement of the latter one. You have to constantly tweak your planets, pay attention to science and construction vessels and negotiate with dozens of empires which sounds interesting at first but quickly turns into a repetitive chore. Allowing faster ways to switch between planets and auto-upgrading of planet tiles should be a priority for Paradox.The whole vassal system seems to be unfinished as well - AI will never build or upgrade space ports and ships, and you have to manually select every planet in sector from the map to do it yourself.Other than a lot of unnecessary micro and lack of some UI features the game is actually pretty solid even without 100 inevitable dlc's paradox is going to release. The graphics are decent, the music is good, AI makes ""some"" effort and it is true that it doesn't actually attack you the moment they become slightly superior like in other 4x games.The game also restricts your expansion with influence points, borders and lack of habitable planets. Even on a huge map with 1000 planets you won't get that many colonies before you are surrounded by other empires. This means that unless they are really lucky with starting point and resources - everyone is going to be more or less equal mid game. Which can be good or bad depending on how fast you built those frontier bases which extend your borders early on.I can recommend this game even in it's current state. I have no doubt that paradox is going to release numerous patches and dlc's to address most of those issues. Considering that modding support is also there we can expect a lot of custom races like star wars, star trek, babylon 5, etc that will make this game even better.			"

												This game is just ""okay"". The company, however, is awful. Paradox recently decided to moderate and ban mods for any arbitruary reason. They banned my mod ""European Phenotypes and Names"" - and then proceeded to lie about me and my mod. If you don't believe me, go to my YouTube ""Progeny of Europe"" and watch what happened (can't put links here), everything is archived there so you can get all the facts without the media runaround or the Paradox misinformation. I even recieved death threats as a result of what they did.You don't have to like me or my mod - but you should at least know what kind of company you are dealing with. And any modder should beware - they take your mod down through a STEAM BAN. So, if you are thinking about modding this game, just know this is a possibility and be aware of the risks associated with it.Edit:Paradox's official and final word (an email to me):""I was asked to get in touch with you so am now taking the opportunity to do so.We were originally going to discuss the circumstances around your previous mod submission, it does appear now though that you've already successfully resubmitted it.  With that in mind and considering you appear to be firmly moderating it we feel there's nothing more needing to be said in the matter.""That's right, the modder - according to Paradox (no TOS or anything states this anywhere) - is completely responsible for COMMENTS left on their mod. I have a video showing the comments left on my mod - out of around 86 comments only 2 were 'somewhat' eye brow raising. But this was enough to issue a ban via Steam. As a modder you have no control over the comments besides clickng ""delete"" - an absurd standard and rule just created on the fly. No one has time to have a second job moderating the comment section, nor was it ever stated you had to.This is their statement, after the lied and called me a, ""racist"", ""white supremacist"", that my mod (somehow) ""discriminated"" against people, that I ""changed the description to make it racist"" - archives show I only changed it once (to let people know it still worked even if it said out of date) and never had anything ""racist"" in it.So this is what you get, a company that will lie and slander you in order for them to not take responsibility for something as trivial as deleting a mod.Modders beware.And yes, I can back up every claim I made here with facts and evidence to categorically prove how shady and unprofessional Paradox has been during this debacle.

												This game really is heavy in learning, and details and and and...I really appreciate the ship designer, so your fleet is controllable in matters like propulsion, energy generating, weaponry, hull, shields, etc...And another pluspoint: you can have more ships than your limit. But it costs more to sustain them.My friend gifted me this like 2 days ago. I thought, it looks fun. Now I have already 20 hours of gameplay. On one savegame. Yeah we might be slow, but it is fun!Allthough I dont like not being able to have war and conquer everything in one go. Instead you have to set it as war goals beforehand, conquer them, and cause trouble in the remaining part of the enemy empire... Kinda weird but it goes well, if you dont want to have an everlasting war with the gigantic empire next door. With their 30k fleet. against your 12k. Kinda sucks.And what is even worse? When the 120k fleet flys across the universe just to mess up with the brand new updated 20k fleet.EDIT: Please improve Serverlist and Joining (actually it's not the worst)			"

												TLDR: What a gem in the making... lovely, enjoyable, stable even in Mp, still a bit rough around the edges but all in all, worth the money.Here a few more details from our 16ppl. Multiplayer Release Session:It started out a bit rough, we couldnt get half the group in since we were using a password protected server. Once we removed the apparently buggy password, it worked like a charm for hours until very early in the morning when the hype train came to a slow stop when nearly everybody was falling asleep because we played the crap out of the game. And boy did everyone enjoy this. There was no dissappointment in our group. We started out as noobs and within just a few hours we sent fleets of 10k strength out to conquer, massive battles happened and empires got hammered. We even roleplayed our societies and alien nature to a degree. The Game invites you to do it, its just a lot of fun to do it.Here are some pros and cons:The game starts out relatively slow. The first 1-2 hours are nice nonetheless cause of the exploration, the discoveries, the endless storylines and the research that enlightens you. But you dont really know what´s happening. There is no techtree you can look up to plan the best way to research and expand. You literally have to explore it. And it was pretty different for all of us. People in Teamspeak were constantly talking about stuff they researched which others never saw and didnt understand...cause it was fundamentally different from what they experienced....within the same game.The Game was stable the entire time. We had a few crashes for a few guys, for whatever reason but the majority was able to play and the server never crashed. Hotjoining works like a charm, admin can allow new guys to hotjoin or kick them out. It does not disturb the gameflow. (unlike civ, where it stopped the game). It feels kind of well thought through and polished in that regard.Graphics are beautifull and bring the universe to life. Its the little things that make this game so nice. Supported with the storytelling its just so immersive. You feel like you are in a universe with a history. Stuff you find is thousands, sometimes millions of years old.The Soundtrack is just freakin brilliant. People in our Server on Teamspeak were enjoying it a hell of a lot. It didnt disturb, it made you feel well and you were still able to play, talk, relax and enjoy the game. What else can you expect?Here are a few cons:Sometimes, even though the UI is already well done, the game gets a bit tedious. For example your groundforces have to be managed manually one by one. You will need around 20-30 of them for an invasion. Now you go to a planet, recruit them and now each one of them can be equipped... enjoy the clickfest. Each one needs to be selected, outfitted again and again and again...and then you send them out, select their ships and move them to...whereever. Its tedious, crap and annoying and in dire need of an optimization in the UI. Revolts seem to be a bit out of balance. Imagine, your fleet just bombed the living hell out of a planet, you killed the defence, took it over, win the war...take the planet as your price and now what? People get unhappy, join a faction, declare war on you and spawn like a gazillion troops. Ofc, those are amazing, kick you in the face and throw you out. It took me 5 planets on full production of groundforces and several attemps to take 1 of 2 revolting planets back. I had to bring around 20-30 Groundtroops for a revolt... something you can take an entire empire with.Other than that, the game feels well balanced, nicely done and none of us really wanted to stop playing. But we were already falling  asleep so we HAD to stop.Damn you body, for being to weak to play and demanding sleep. Cant you see im hyped? ;-)11/10 would play an enslaving hivemind again that lives basically forever (in slavery) and is happy about it :D			"

												Really, really tried to 'like' the game but I am driven to be negative as, despite much potential, the flawed combat systems, extreme challenge and a weird faction AI are too much for me. Tried several starts. Firstly, it is really hard to find nearby inhabitable planets that aren't already in someone else's space. There's not a lot of space to explore. Secondly,  you're consequently forced to turn nasty - mainly out of boredom. How much fun is your single planet system..? There's nothing else to do but attack! Thirdly, after spending several hours of gameplay building up a decent fleet, you can overcome an enemy planet or system only then to have it rebel against you! The rebels then use your own tech to kill you off. Forthly, once you encounter a superior enemy combat is really one sided. They take out your systems way faster than you can repair or defend them. Nothing that I can see that you can do about it. Lastly, I tried again - repeat - same things happen. After 20 hours, a game really has to grab me and keep me coming back for more. I need to se potential things I can do to overcome my mistakes - strategies that I can work on or improve - but I have decide this game hates me. I get a decent little empire together - it rebels against me or is crushed by an enemy AI. The game just needs to give me a little helping hand; tell me what to do;  give me a clue; hold my hand through the hard stuff; give me a little time to digest what you're doing?!? No chance. While this may float many of your boats, I have run out patience with it. Sorry - this is for more hardcore minds than mine.			"

												Stellaris is another great grand strategy game by Paradox. However, it does feel lacking when compared to their more complete products such as the CK and EU series.If you are new to grand strategy, then Stellaris might be an easier starting point. However, it does feel slower in tempo compared to EU4 and if you want to fight from day 1, then you might want to stick with buying EU4 or HOI4.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. But it ended up a disappointment. I feel like I gave paradox a chance to fix the game, but alas some major flaws in the combat and diplomacy system still haven't been adressed over half a year after release.* The combat lacks strategy, it feels like it is just a ""the bigger stack wins""* The system to end a war feels very unsatifiying; The AI often requests star systems from an ally in peace negotiations and winning a defensive wars has far too few benefits.

												    This is my first and hopefully last review, that I 'll ever write for steam. The general ratings you find on steam are typically trustworthy, unfortunately Stellaris does not follow suit. Before I go any further, may I say for the record, that I have shown ferverous support for Paradox. I have well over 1200 hours played on Ck2 and over 500 on EU4. Within 40 hours of playing Stellaris, I was dumbfounded by how unfinished of a product this truly is. The tiny intricate marvels the player experiences within the first half of the game become irrelevant by the time Big powers have become established. Races, Politics, decision making, even research, becomes almost arbitrary. The game boils down to how many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ships do you have in your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ death congolomerate and how many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ships do the other powers have in theirs. Paradox has never been known for detailed combat sequences, which I have always been okay with. Combat was never a major focus, for the majority of the titles they put out. Stellaris was not meant to be one of paradox's few excepetions. Unforatuntely the game becomes too restricted, in all facets of the word space, that the last half of the game ends up you declaring mind numbing wars for the however many hours it takes you to win.  In addition, There are tons of bugs. Just to name a few, Missing armies - If a war ends and you have armies stuck on a planet that you do not own, they end up ""dissappearing"". They will still show up on the side panel, and you will still have to pay upkeep for them, but you are unable to locate them and or disband them.   Never Growing Pops-. There is a feature in the game in which you may allow your pops to freely migrate from planet to planet, not only within the confines of your empire, but other space empires if you so make an agreement with said parties. What ends up happening is, a pop of a particular race will move to your planet and then say ""eh, this place ♥♥♥♥ing sucks"" and leaves a solid 3 minutes later. once the pop gets there it starts to ""Reproduce"". a sillouhette will appear in a production slot of said species, but won't produce anything till it's fully grown. when the original pop migrates away. the shadow pop will stop growing because there are no more members of the same species on that planet. Instead of the shadow pop dissapearing it stays there stuck on 0.0 growth.     Gene mutation - ♥♥♥♥ed, ♥♥♥♥ed, ♥♥♥♥ed. ♥♥♥♥ed.The interface, is also really ♥♥♥♥ing clunky. It's extremely unfriendly and I constantly find myself saying ""why wouldn't they do this a different way"" It seems as though it was an afterthought. Unfinished, much like the rest of the game.That being said, there are some wonderful features. tons of intricacies that will literally help you forget all the other♥♥♥♥♥♥the game has been throwing in your face. The initial option of race/ empire creation is extremely detailed. It allows the player to really immerse him/herself into the game before it's even begun. It allows for a full range of motion in choosing a player's species' ideologies, short comings and strengths. Early game alien interactions, research and discovery are also incredibly detailed and really help guide the game without it feeling too restricted.I just feel that, after spending 40 hours playing Stellaris and witnessing such an unfinished game, that I cant help but think that Paradox is taking full advantage of a loyal fanbase. This game was pegged as being one of the most colossal games they have ever released, and so far it seems as though they put such little time into it. I'm sure Paradox will fix it, but how many DLC's and expansions will I need to buy? How many mods will I need to download? I'm sorry, but for anyone who is thinking of buying this game, realize that despite paying 40 dollars for this game, you will not recieve a product worth the money in return. "

Posted: June 29, 2016
												I don't recommend this game yet but let me tell you first what the game is about: basically it's a 4X game. Collect resources on explored planets by colonizing them and/or building facilities. Keep expanding and researching new technologies whilst managing your rule by diplomacy, war and other means.The main goal is conquest, but events may be triggered by exploring anomalies in space. Events are like miini-adventures which may lead to great rewards and sometimes lead to disaster. This is a super fun idea. But here's my first complaint: more events are needed. After only a few runs you've seen it and done it all.It's a very accessible game. Diplomacy is really simplified and in general I don't think the game is that challenging. So that's the second downside. I have read that some players have done and seen it all and lost interest already and frankly so did I.The combat is broken, uninspiring and oversimplified. In a battle, the ships just rush forward only to end up in a big furry ball and then the ships are shot in order by its size. You can't focus fire or micromanage a battle at all. Especially if you're having a fanatic PVP combat background in Eve Online you'll going to loath this simplified combat system.Then there's the middle game. It is massively boring and the only way to move forward is to invent more weaponry because I'm too weak to go to war, but so is everybody. Basically on all fronts the middle game is a grind-fest.Also, in the middle game, all parties can have defense pacts, which makes it impossible to go to war with anyone. So in this case one has to wait for the endgame scenarios to trigger, which could take a very long time still.As the science research moves forward slowly - research has become more expensive as you expand - I'm just sitting here picking a fight with insignificant space pirates or aliens. I literally fell asleep in this middle game and I'm not going to end it.Sectors: the player is allowed to micromanage only a limited amount of colonized planets. To own more planets you have to create sectors. This will let the AI manage colonized planets, which opens slots for you to colonize new planets.  But the AI does a horrible job at managing. What's the point anyway. Paradox probably feared the player might get overburdened.Another thing the AI does bad is auto-fitting your ships. To be more precise, that feature by itself is nonsensical. The system doesn't know which type of enemy ships you aim to counter; it really matters, so the auto-fitting feature shouldn't exist. You can manually fit ships, it's just that the auto-fitting feature is wasted item in the interface if you will.Finally there's the clunky interface. From weapon-types to customized ships, from diplomacy to trading and empire management, the interface is kind of a messy and straightforward design.And so I can't recommend the yet. This is an early-release as it is popular for producers to do so these days and that means a lot of unfinished business will be - hopefully - added through patches. If new patches improve things, I will update this review! Again, it has potential but not worth your money right now.Conclusion:+ Interesting Start+ Great Idea+ Decent Graphics+ Customization (of traits) of Races+ Relative Easy Modding and Modding Support- Boring Experience After The Opening Phase- Overall Bad Execution of Game Concept- Oversimplified Battles- Weird Factors with respect to Diplomacy, (declaring) War, Trades- Clunky Interface for a Wide Area of Things- In General Game is not Finished by a Long ShotNote: edited slightly because of the arrival of patch 1.2.1. New patch corrects a few things but also added a small armada of new bugs and problems.			"

												A great balance of the typical 4X games and the grand strategy games for which Paradox is well known. It starts small and slow with excellent writing (exploration actually feels... exploratory), but then gradually turns into the static, politicing, and warmongering that you'd expect from a grand strategy game. I will admit the game as it currently stands feels like just the start of the journey. It is a well put together peice of software but it does lack some of the comlexity I've grown used to in other Paradox games. However, those games have also been DLC'd about 15 times a peice (additions of which I approve). Give the developers time to see how people play, hear what they want, and think about the game's direction and I'm positive the great base they've started with here will become just as magnificent as their other Grand Strategy Titles. Until then I'll just keep enjoying Stellaris in its excellent current form.			"

												I like playing 4X and this is why I purchased Stellaris.So, what is a 4 X?XploreXploitXpandXterminateWhat does Stellaris provide?XcruciateIn the year 2680, I have 1k fleet cap. The game chugs. Periods of up to 15 seconds where nothing happens in the gui.I get this uncanny feeling Stellaris is written in C# and the garbage collector is having more fun than me.Clarke 1.1 Update: If it ain't broken then releases a bugged patch.I started a new game and OFTEN now parts of the gui disappear and it chugs even worse and frequent crashes about 1 per hour.Federations are crap as the Leader determines what wars are fought and you have no say in wargoals. Try finding the leader or rivals or embassies without listing each empire. BAH!Sector economics fail with stored res but no dev and space stations which remove your ship building modules and delete your construction queue. And still the tedious mid game colony management.Further bugs of my fleets simply disappearing and alien fleets performing double jumps through non allied territory.Asimov 1.2 Update: *double silent facepalm*Trumpets blare across the galaxy as I discover the patch has eliminated all my core planet bonuses from 18 back to the base of 5 and in 5 months empire is totally bankrupt.1.4 Update: Stiill essentially flawedI didn't play Stellaris for a while because I found watching paint drying more entertaining. Come back to find a new release, played a mini game of 600 stars. Is the game better? Nope. Have they fixed any bugs? Possibly but the game still chugs and the graphics dies after a while leaving splattered images and unreadable text. Why do my fleets evade towards the enemy? Suicidal from the emptiness of a bland game, a long drawn out boredom fest with no challenge. Ship design has improved, but really, 4 ship sizes and a tiny handful of patterns which vary only the types of weapon arrangements and you will end up with all techs as there are so few of them. Anad apart from some minor tinkering with economics, no real experiential differences worth noting.			"

												Dear developers. Sorry. This is the Most. Boring. Game. Ever. Really, it is just a bunch of timers trying to be interesting. When the timer ends, you choose a new timer. And the UI seems designed to keep you busy. BORING. And the wars. Fighting wars with this system sucks. I fight a war, and the other guys can suddenly declare peace? What? What could be done to make it better? 1. Make the consequences of choices actually clear, now there are so many choices it is totally unclear what does what. It just doesn't seem to matter much. 2. Restructure the AI so you get away from micromanaging timers and into strategy. Now a lot of time is spent finding that particular planet back, etc. That is stuff the computer should do for you. I want to think about how to kill the other empire. Another thing the computer should do: show me what would happen to the border if I would place a frontier outpost. What will the influence be? That makes it less guesswork. If you get some feedback you can easily spend a lot of  more interesting time planning how to best expand the borders.3. Why do I only see what planets are habitable in the galaxy map when I have a colony ship selected? Please make a 'colony planner view' or something that will show that. Or use overlays. 4. If a trade ends, why is there no button that allows you to propose the trade again. Now I need to manually keep a list of what I trade with whom. Many such examples.5. Please show me a tech tree so I can plan what research to pick. Or at least a 'general direction' tech tree. 6. For flavor, it would be nice to have some kind of 'history' that gets created while you play. Add some events '100 year existence of colony X' etc. Remember great leaders and scientists. Now they are just RNG strings. I could go on. For prospective buyers: If you want to skip spending a bunch of hours hoping that it will change beyond managing timers, don't buy it. If you like staying 'busy' pressing the occasional random upgrade, by all means go ahead. Or try Adventure Capitalist. It does the same thing but in a more interesting way.  "

												Simply put, Stellar is dull. Empty. It has promise -- the promise that Paradox will fill out the game with a series of $5-$15 DLC -- but as is, the game is little more than a shell. You start out alright, exploring, investigating, developing. Then... blob? Don't blob? Whatever you do, it's boring. With no diplomacy, not politics, no internal storylines, Stellaris as is, is just a bore.			"

Posted: May 13, 2016
												I played one full game to completetion and multiple to the glacial grind point. As it stands the game isnt horrible, but there isnt enough variety for more then maybe one full playthrough. I am going to describe my full playthrough experience so a bit of spoiler warning here.The early game is great. You survery around get your mini quests(situation log) and major quests which gives you a drive to finish and see what you get. You encounter probably 3-4 ""neutral"" aliens(prismatic, ameoba, void, mining, and the gas grazers) Learn more about them get trait specific options to resolve those quests. You research is quick lets you branch out and see what you focus on. Then you run into another Alien empire, which essentially walls you off from exploring or questing. This gives you three options go explore somewhere else, amass a fleet to eventually attack them to get them out of your way, or ally with them(which is basically the same as conquering them). You talk to the empire which is pointless unless you want to trade embassies and wait till you can form an alliance(which having one early makes it easier in the late game but ill get there).The mid game is alright. At this point you have run into a few more alien factions, started colonizing other planets to expand your borders, and research is starting to slow down. They will start offering to trade star charts which ends up being a trap. While it is nice to be able to see more of the galactic map and resources they hold, it also removes the option to survey those worlds which means no anomolys(quests) Once you see more of the map you start to see that you are now boxed in by alien factions leaving you only two choices, ally with them or attack them. Since the diplomacy screen is basically ""do you have an embassy?"" most of the time you wont be able to invite them into an alliance, but usually that first alien you met will likely join up with you. So now you build your fleet that at max consists of 4 different ships: corvette, destroyer, cruiser, battleship based off of your shipyard level. ONLY 4 FOR EVERY RACE/FACTION. Granted you can ""customize"" each ship trying to make a more well rounded fleet with different weapon types, but you will fall into hitting the auto-best option because you cant counter the different types without knowing the types the enemy has. Anyways you built your fleet, then look at the diplomacy tab to see if the person you are about to attack has equal or less then fleet strength and you declare war. You set your war goals(anything other then vassalization just means your going to have to war with them again). Ally AI is set to put thier fleet ontop of your highest military power fleet. So now you send your death ball into their system you see thier fleet is numerically lower then the combined fleet of you and your ally and you clash. You get to sit and wait as the  ships just charge and swirl around each other until one fleet is dead. Your warscore goes up a bit for winning. You need at least 70% to win a war. Since you decimated thier fleet there wont be anymore fleet battles so now you have to build an army to take planets. Sit your fleet over a planet until the plantery defense number hits 0 and drops troops if you have a higher number you win and planet taken. Based off of how big the enemy empire is you will have to repeat this until you win the war. You WIN and now have a vassal!(which means you now have another ally to help you fight wars).The late game and it is terrible. Research now takes decades even with all the research buffs you can muster. You have expanded  colonizing, frontier posting, or integrating your vassals(which takes exponetially longer based off thier size, one vassal took roughly 100 years). Entire map is seen you cant finish some of your quests(precurser alien quest), and some end game event happens. Mine was the prethorian scourge invaded the galaxy. At some point a quest to seize their queen appeared but it bugged out and i couldn't finish the quest. THe Prethorian scourge was systemactically infesting worlds and conquering empires. It was a cool event which spiced things up, until i realized that the ai factions didnt care about stopping it. It was just another day in the galaxy to them. So i was like fine I will handle it myself until i realize that the prethorian scourges planets cant be captured or destroyed. I had to systemactically go to every planet they had and leave a fleet in orbit bombing so they wouldnt produce anything anymore. With roughly half of my fleet capacity left to endlessly bomb unkillable ai i looked at the victory condition page. Only two options colony 40% or kill off everyone else which essentially boiled down to the same thing. Declare war on everybody who wasnt an ally or vassal. At this point is where the game reaches it most boring and it will happen for evey game you play(since there are no other victory conditions). Build battleships and train armies, declare war, demand vasslization kill enemy, invade planet, Systemaccally taking over the galaxy which may sound fun but it boils down to number battles. You spend more time building then fighting. Eventually you will win and it will be unsatisfying.TLDR Pros and ConsPros- Turnless civ game in space!- Very pretty- Anomolys(quests)- Cool research options(for the most part)- Early gameCons- Diplomacy and everything about it- Influence(could have been an awesome diplomacy resource just ends up holding you back)- Mid and Late game end up a boring repetitive slog- DIFFERENCES IN RACES AND SHIPS, this kind of a big one. All races and ships are basically the same(aside from appearance) give me something that plays different .No purely robotic race, no zerg(plethorian scourge should have some sort of playable varient) One of the fallen empires has a ring world system I WANT IT why can i not have it?,Final VerdictI can't recommend because after one playthrough you just wont want to play another because nothing really will change. I have tried ended up the same every game, especially the end game which is a snorefest. The game has a solid core to build upon and from what i hear these developers actually do stuff so i look forward to the future where this game is a must buy.Recommended changes.-More and varied research paths WITH FASTER SPEEDS or make a gameplay speed button measured in years because days doesnt cut it.-more and varied quest missions-more victory conditions-espionage and better diplomacy (USE INFLUENCE)-an even faster speed up option-more and varied base starting points(MAKE DIFFERENT EMPIRES PLAY DIFFERENTLY)-more and varied ships and weapons(wouldn't a militaristic have more then pacifists?!)-Do something with armies(who pays attention to moral?)

												In truth I wasn't sure what to expect from 'Stellaris'.I've played RTS games such as 'Company of Heroes' and turn-based games such as the 'Civilisation' series before and somehow this game manages to merge the best of both worlds. It does this by combining the real-time (though pausable) orders system with a massively in-depth command and control element, not to mention the massive technology research trees that go from usuing simple thrusters on your ships to navigate your system to FTL-drives for inter-galaxy travel.This game takes a while to get into, but it does have an optional tutorial system built in that will explain what each screen does, and introduce you to many of the deeply-involving facets of the game. Its by no means an EASY game to get into - you aren't going to be taking over the galaxy within the first 10 minutes, but if you can afford to put time into a game such as this, I feel you'll find it deeply rewarding. I've only spent ~5hrs with it so far, and I certainly enjoy it.Pros:Widely customisable : You can not only crate your own faction and name it what you like, but you can also set traits that will affect how other space-faring civilisations view you - whether it be as a xenophobic human military-dictatorship (my current build) or as a plant-based pacifist race. You are also able to customise and design your own ships using technology you research to outfit them with the fastest engines and most-powerful weaponry.Huge scope: Starting a new game allows you to determine the size of the galaxy (as well as many other options). The galaxy my current game has currentlyt holds ~1000 star systems, with each system holding on average 5 or 6 planetary bodies (some habitiable, some only useful for their resources).Cons:Only worth getting if you can afford to sink a lot of time into. I'm 5 hours in and am barely scratching the surface. As I said above its a slow game to get into, but I feel it is becoming a rather rewarding experience.10/10 - Not a game for everyone, as many prefer the faster-pace offered by other genres, but if you're a strategy fan then words cannot convey how much I recommend this game.

												I'll keep my review short, as there are plenty of excellent, informative reviews already. If you're a huge fan of Paradox games like I am, stay away from this game. Any illusion of depth of strategy disappears quickly. There are a host of problems (AI, diplomacy, sector system, etc.), and what bothers me the most is that there is no excuse for a Paradox game to be this bad. I know what Paradox is capable of, even on vanilla releases. EU4, CK2, and in my opinion, Vic2, were great games in their initial releases. Do not buy.			"

												After playing this game for 60 hours, I have to warn you off. As with many off the negative reviews, I agree that the ealy game is fun, but it becomes problematic later on. I've played many Paradox games, and while they make the politics look similar to EU4, the options for negotiating peace aren't as workable. What's more, I've entered into wars where a bunch of races will jump on you depite you having a better relationship with them than the defender does. And the Federation Associtaion does lilttle to no good, since they won't help you out in a war you join to help them. Don't waste your time or money.			"

												Stellaris is a game tries to offer a deep, methodical, and emergent scifi experience. What it actually delivers is hours upon hours of shifting your ships around to manually survey, guard, and build hundreds of planets while reading textbox events. The vast majority of the early game involves sending survey ships to new systems while your military sits at home staring at the starter alien fleets you won't be able to kill for 30 years.That deep emergent plot? It takes the form of randomized events. Want to find a Precursor homeworld? Enjoy surveying 100 systems and rolling the dice on anomalies. Better hope that none of the systems you need are in another empire's territory! Your reward, if you finish, will be yet another textbox of pregen story and a bit more resources on a planet.The early game is heavily luck based. With Fallen Empires, advanced start empires, and opposed empires, its easily possible to start wedged between three existential threats. Beyond that, since star position is randomized and habitatibility varies by species, you may end up with a capital that sits by itself and all of your starting expansions contested by a similar species. When it turns out you were screwed from turn one, enjoy restarting and setting up those 200 survey and exploration trips again!In the midgame you get to enjoy the wonder that is Rock Paper Scissors in ship form. Do you know the AI ship patterns and build the hard counter? Grats, you can annhilate ships two or three times yoru size! Screw up and have missiles when you needed lasers? You're screwed. Enjoy resetting. If you're not at war, the midgame consists of crapping out colony ships and waiting on the next tech to finish in 30 more months.Late game is a series of precanned events that all follow the pattern of dropping a bunch of massive fleets out of nowhere. Oh, look, a 100k fleet! Hope youve been building fleet power for the last 75 years! Oh, and you best have the right counter for those fleets, or there is no way to build enough ships.Diplomacy is almost entirely based on two factors: If your species philosophy matches and if you have border friction. There is very little you can do to prevent war if an opposed philosophy butts up against you. Don't bother.Even if all this doesn't sound droll, you can expect the 20 to 30 hour playtime for a proper game to drive you into a dusty grave. Much of that time is just waiting for more surveying, more ships to move, more construction to complete - even on Fastest, there are long stretches of nothing to do.This game is an exercise in tedium with a randomized plot less structured than a tumblr blog.

												I gave this game a chance because it had some nice features, but ultimately its negatives are just too much for me to enjoy it. You might find your style of 4x space game play is different than mine, I am a control freak.Positives- Has RPG style leadership control or scientists, military and system leaders.                 A different system of research with no fixed pyramid but a random option of which projects you can do.                 Nice diplomacy system, lots of options and you can build trust over time.                 Graphics are fine, not the best but it is pleasant to the eyeBig Negatives-  Planet control system.  You have a very small limit of what you can control, and must set up AI controlled                                              sections of your empire. For control freaks like me, this absolutely goes against what 4x games are about.                           The combat system is archaic, you have virtually no control over the battles.  Automatic systems are not                                                        the worst ever, but with most space 4x games having an option to have some control, this game leaves                                                  control freaks flustered.                           The diplomatic system of war is completely worthless.  Basically war is a no lose option if you're bigger                           than your enemy and you attack them.  You get what you want or worst case you get nothing, but you                           don't lose anything but some fleet.  If you have the AI declare war on you it's a no win situation, so just                           reload to your last save game and then declare war on them because as soon as you go to invade their                           planets in retaliation, the war ends and ""you get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!""  "

												I do not recommend buying this game at this point. I just lacks flavor and most playthroughs feel the same. Midgame is pretty empty and galaxy conquest becomes annoying once you built up some aggression with your enemies who'll all join the same alliance so taking a planet is going to net you relatively few war score and it's going to take forever to win the wars which oftentimes lack major engagements, because the AI is literally programmed to run from you unless they outnumber you 1.5:1 which is rarely the case. This all ties in with the lack of meaningful late game diplomacy. All in all you'll probably enjoy a single blob playthough and then start with a couple of different empires to realize it will all mostly play out the same anyways and the fact that the government and ethics are kinda imbalanced like playing xenophics is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when collectivists get the straight up better bonuses, techs and buildings. They've already mentioned it in the patchnotes, but to repeat it: Ethic convergence is annoying as ♥♥♥♥ and can barely be countered besides choosing conformist at the start of the game with a fat 20% bonus.♥♥♥♥♥♥like this cripples playstyles due to min/max concerns on my part. Start as xenophobic to see how by 2250 over 50% of your population is xenophile...Should've waited for HoI4, too sad.			"

												Long time Paradox fan but this new entrant does not (in my opinion) match up to the hype. There is a lot of new and shiny to grab the attention initially, but it is all very shallow. 1. Combat:  This is just a ""bigger number wins"" with very little player input.2. Diplomacy is basically non-existent. As AI is notoriously difficult to programme well in a fluid negotiating system Paradox have gone for the easier route of ""The only deal the AI is going to agree to is massively one-sided in their favour"". Irrespective of supposed species/cultural preferences. This means they can avoid the AI making stupid deals by forcing the payer to make them instead.3. Planet development/ Empire Development: Build stuff, research new stuff, build that. Very little so far to make each planet feel unique after the intial clearance/settlement. Some minor balancing of resource generation.....4. War/Conquest: There seem to be a lot of artificial barriers to carrying out a war of conquest. You can only capture X number of planets before the war finishes, no war after that for Z years with same faction, integration very slow etc etc. Some of these may be realistic but I have the terrible suspicion that they were put there to prevent a good player (not me) from steamrolling and winning too quickly. All in all I found myself too often playing on ""Fast"" or ""Fastest"" waiting for the next bit of research, planet development.Conclusion: Shallow 4x light that is disappointing given its creators. However your enjoyment may differ and hopefully patches will add some depth! "

												Stellaris has a strong base to build on: good control core (playing in real time requires some getting used to but it works), good expansion/management gameplay, and pretty graphics that you don't expect to see in a game like this one. Sadly it fails at so many other things, and particularly the whole diplomacy and trading side of things which becomes very important mid-game is so opaque and frustrating, with a terrible UI coming with it, that it can ruin an entire game.Let's hope that Paradox will get to improve this part with expansions, but for the time being it's hard to recommend the game.

												Unlike other games in this genre, Paradox has created an inflexible game that as you progress increasingly becomes more and more boring due to limitations they built into the game on purpose.  What limitations?  (1) The larger you get the more your tech advances cost, and if you get ahead tech wise your tech costs go up again.  This effectively keeps most players within a narrow band tech wise, as Paradox hated the whole idea of people trying to race up tech trees to gain advantages.  You can't do that here.  (2) The game always has to be played with some type of advanced tech alien in the game (fallen empires).  And these empires have ships so in advance of you that you have no hope of beating them until very late in a game.  Plus if you settle to close to them they get upset and attack, forcing you to destroy the settlement + one or two other worlds as punishment.  SO while you can't race up the tree, you have an enemy you have to avoid in order to survive.  (3) Limited world control.  Oh so sorry, you can only directly control 5 (or a few more with tech advances) worlds at a time.  The rest have to be assigned to sectors and controlled by the (dumb AI) computer.  And just to force you to keep to that mechanic, it will cost you precious admin points to remove a world from a sector (so no moveing worlds in and unless you cheat and give yourself admin to make up for this stupidity).  (4) No way to break up alien alliances.  Once they form they are more solid than diamonds.  All you can do is get in your own alliance and both sides can stare at each other daring one to cross the border.  Hence mid game and later becomes massive wars where you are depending on your computer allies for any success .. and if they screw up, you are so screwed.  (5) Late Game boredom.  And this is the reason you see so few games of Stellaris being posted on the net .. people have quickly tired of the game.  If you want to win a domination victory, you usually have to go to war alliance to alliance, and target only a few planets each war.  If you try for more, since they can jump around in space, you usually end up in a trading game of you taking planets while their fleets take your planets and neither side advances war wise.  So the game bogs down into go to war, take a couple planets, end war, get planets out of resistance, go to war again .. over and over and over while you try to advance on the domination victory mark.  I could keep going on and on with all the issues and errors in this game.  it's one of the worst I've purchased and I'd return it for a refund if I could.			"

												So, after about 40 hours each, my friend and I decided to start a Multiplayer game, and the game really shines here. There are some issues though, for example the Technologies you get to research is randomised each time, which is frustrating as in twenty years my friend have UV Lasers and Level 3 Shields, whilst all my fleet had was Level 3 Thrusters, Sensors, and a Level 2 Hyperdrive (He had a military strength of around 1500, I had a mil strength of 450). So if we could get a more conventional Tech Tree, or at least the choice to have a Tech Tree, that would be great.All in all, the game is very good, with some more features it could be great, it just needs a bit more polish, some Trade (Outside of minerals for energy, or info etc.,) such as Trade Lanes that provide a net boost to Credits, more in-depth Diplomacy, a bit more control over the sectors (I have a few hundred energy and they often have thousands), and a bit more balance over the Military, and it should be great. Still worth a buy right now, it is very enjoyable, it just has potential to be even greater.			"

												I began the game using a custom made civilization of my own design, the United Sicaren Compact. I was able to choose a variety of factors that helped mould my would be space empire: my people's ethics, the style of government, what kind of world they inhabited, and so on and so forth. Soon I was happy with the empire I had created and began my game in a galaxy of 600 stars, one empire among many all set on galactic domination. As a fanatically militaristic society, the United Sicaren Compact immediately set out to exploiting the resources of my home system and the stars surrounding it. As my burgeoning fleet grew ever larger, I came into contact with another empire very much like my own, the Bloc of Garan'Ferpi. Our relationship did not start off well and we spent several years hurling insults at each other across the vastness of space. However, my fleets were becoming larger, my armies more deadly, and so I decided to throw more than insults at the aliens.My conquest of the Galan'Ferpi was swift, and I ground them beneath my heel, offering them a chance to be my vassal or die. They chose subservience. With my newly acquired, and extremely discontent, servant nation, I set my sights on another empire, the Haahn Cartel. These birdmen were nothing but traders and diplomats. Their fleets were nothing compared to my own or that of my vassal. The Haahn also became my slaves.So encouraged by my massive successes, I chased war after war throughout the galaxy. The United Sicaren Compact was a force unstoppable by the rest of the galaxy's empires! Nation after nation fell to my fleet and the number of my vassals grew swiftly!My ego became engorged by my successes, and soon I no longer scouted my potential prey before declaring war and descending upon them. I came upon another empire, the Usanace Forerunners. To me, they were another empire I assumed would fall easily considering they only had two systems colonized. My fleets in position, I declared war and summoned my vassals to my side. However, I was not prepared for what awaited me. As soon as the declaration was sent warning sirens blared at me of danger. Somehow my own systems were already under attack, despite their being half the galaxy away! As my own fleet materialized in the Usanace Forerunner's system, I saw that I was doomed. Their fleets were far more numerous than mine and their ships vastly more powerful. At my empire's capital, a massive fleet had appeared as though they had always been there and laid waste to my space stations and planetary fortifications.My fleet was lost in seconds, my planets' infrastructure destroyed with nary a thought. The Usanace Forerunners had crushed me like the impudent whelp I was. They demanded my surrender, which I was forced to accept considering my situation. However, they were not done with me. As soon as the leader of the United Sicaren Compact, my own avatar, signed the surrender, he was viciously assassinated by the very same people who had forced him to sign it.My fleets gone and my empire in shambles, I tried to rebuild what I had lost. However, within a year my vassals began to rise up against me, one after another, as they fought for independence. I had no chance and I was crushed beneath the weight of my own hubris.This was just my first playthrough of Stellaris. I await eagerly the story that will unfold in my next playthrough!			"

												Very polished. It's a Paradox game, you can be assured of that. And you know what, I'm going to reccommend this game because there's sadly not a whole lot of polished space strategy games out there, and this one is certainly worth taking a peek at. HOWEVER, and I suggest you read this... (EDIT: Added a list of things below if you're into reading ;)The game would have you believe this is a very indepth space strategy game about cultivating an alien civilization. And... sure, it is. But it feels less like a grand strategy and more like a somewhat shallow 4X game. The biggest issue at this point is simply that the only way to 'play' or 'win' the game right now is the expand and or conquer. Literally- those are the only winning conditions. Which wouldn't be an issue, but military conquest and alliance making is literally the entire mid to end game. The game is surprisingly shallow once you hit that stage, and don't expect to build a race focused on amassing wealth via complex trade like the Ferengi, or silently striking with espionage like the Romulans... there just aren't any mechanics for it. You're either making a race that likes to build alliances, or a race that likes to conquer people. But I'm still reccomending the game, because it's still a solid game. And it's a great CORE game, and I can guarantee you Paradox will flood you with DLCs adding new mechanics into the game to really bring it to life, and allow you to play it as you want._________________________________________________________________________WHAT NEEDS FIXING (will update):- Improved AI, so it can better control its fleets especially during war-time. - Improved ally AI, as right now allies do not think independently and instead simply follow your largest fleet about. AI also needs to consider other members of the alliance when suggesting a war, which currently it doesn't. - Various bugs need a fix'n. WHAT THE GAME NEEDS: - Trade system. Setting up physical trade routes, consdering various goods made by your own empire and xeno cultures, PIRACY and space pirates, that sort of stuff. Indepth economy. - Improved diplomacy options, especially in conversing and suggesting things to allies. Things like ""attack X planet"" or ""follow X fleet"". - World generation options. Need more galaxy shapes, an advanced start option, and reaaally need to be able to turn off biased world generation (if you're playing an ocean planet specieis, a good three to four systems around you will always be full of ocean planets). - More victory conditions relating to something other than conquering or intergrating other races. WHAT THE GAME COULD DO WITH (maybe DLC?):- Espionage! Cloaking technology! Romulans, baby! - Hell, even religion would have a place due to the fanatical space races in the game. - Scouting ships, physical envoys, more ship roles. - Possibilities are endless.			"

Soundtrack...amazing2. Beautiful graphics3. very in depth features for species creation4. Randomly generated universes to keep each game unique and differentCons:1. Combat seems a bit straightforward, weapons counter certain shields but bad agianst other ones, but it is hard to know what you're going up against so you have trouble preparing.2. Certain random events can appear (it seems truly random) when you're just starting and ill prepared to face the threatOverall, I think the game is marvelous!			"

												I've been a fan of Paradox for a long time now. Played their games, bought their endless DLCs to show them my support and appreciation for their work. But as much as I would want to recommend this game, I can't.Stellaris is just unfinished at this stage. Like most reviews say, this game is almost bare past mid-game. Also, every patch, and ironically even hot-fixes, brings about a new round of bugs (including some that have quite some impact on certain parts of the game, but are not really apparent until you go about modding the game and reading the code).In short, this game feels like it's early access at best. To be fair to Paradox, they admitted their game was ""rushed"" and have vowed to release some content for free (the most significant one to come end-July/early-August) before they start their paid-DLC model. Makes you wonder why they released an unfinished game in the first place though.			"

												I am about only 4 hours in the game and have to say it is awesome. It has a nice and intelligent stats system with all its improvements, ships, resources. The graphics are great. Its highly customizable, but has a lot of random features or options. I think it will hardly get repetitive. Especiall not with all the mods and community activity. Remember, its also sandbox. There is a lot of detail to it, but not in an overwhelming way. Its just the right amout of depth and width. Because of the randomness and also the richness of detail and text you quickly have some kind of story evolving itself for the species you play. They quickly get some lively history and story, with some personalities and things that happend and are interconnected. You can tell a story to yourself or people you are playing with or your multicasting audience. Its such a nice game. It seems like Paradox Interactive has put a lot of though and love into this. Although it is real time strategy, it's speed is customizable, slow or fast paced or even pausable. Hence I would consider it to be semi-rts. I came from the Civ turn-based genre. Since Civ is not playable anymore I was looking for something comparable and I found this gem. It has the easy to understand stats mechanics as the older Civ games, but bit more complex and versatile. And it has thise great story generating aspect to it, which makes it so lively and lovely. Overall I would say for all 4x fans this is really a must have with all its DLCs. I have to confess, I even bought the Nova edition upgrade just because of the spider species in it, though I never buy any useless skin stuff for games nor soundtracks. But this game really deserves it and makes me want to have all of the fantastic custimization options available. So do yourself a favour and get this game. I am curious about future DLCs published by Paradox, since they are famous for ther continious game development and improvement even after release. This game really deserves a 10 out of 10. Enjoy!

Things they just do right* The fact, you can play DLC content if your server has the DLC, and you are not left out of game mechanics changes without it, but only events if you host a game, makes such DLCs top amongst games like this. No ""Pre-Order-Exclusive Content"" shenanigans, no ""You don't have the DLC so you cant play in this lobby"" stuff. Made me buy the DLC right after release just to know, I can still play with those who will not buy it right away! Civ, look at this.* Networking. For the most part (occasional bugs and desyncs - which seem to be fixed fast), this game is built around the idea of network gaming.* It's real time. It feels like round based. But it's not. So all that sweet planning, but still enough opportunity for fast action.* Workshop: mods are multiplayer ready. And some of them add awesome additional balancing, which shifts the game away from the vanilla competitiveness.* Min-Maxer barriers in the mechanics. Research could need more depth, but some mods take care of that - however, the card rules for how the research system works are awesome, for those who are more creative and do not just play the fastest minmax strategy from start to end. But you still can, limiting you to going the warfare route. This is how it should be.Stuff I love* The style. Pseudorealistic sun systems, eve like overview map, funny stories, this game is so much at the core of what makes space games great, its astonishing. I love it, because a lot of details are very well researched, and some events hint that a lot of thought and research is behind the game. It is good, if sci-fi games are made by people actually interested in space science.* Straight out of the box presets. This game, you got presets en masse. GalCiv3 may only beat it with its ship designer, but even there, they updated visual differences.The Bad* When you have that desync, that never goes away trashing your savegame of 7 days consecutive teamplay.* I whish there were also more presets for fleet styles and some influence on the battle - even if only through delayed ability switches. Again, some mods take care of that.* Techs in vanilla were a bit too linear, they still are somewhat, but it has improved. Having a straight tech for gameplay, and some side techs for specialization is still I think improvable.* I miss tradestations. I miss cloak. I miss more finetuned local diplomacy. Finishing a small research quest by brokering a deal for one science ship to enter some space - or similar - diplomacy could be more. It has been improved in Heinlein, but I still miss short term options. Most of the diplomacy only affects the permanent karma levels between empires. AI could need emotional relations (afraid, annoyed, interested, etc.), to achieve more local goals.Btw. judging from the assets, cloak was indeed part of the development...* I miss a bit of neutral zones, when all empires have their borders, space kind of feels small then. Hyperspace gets boxed in. More interaction, like even trading pops, or shared star systems, maybe border stations which hold only _one_ star in your territorry, to finely define friendly borders. And maybe artificial hyperlanes and jump gates for alliances. I still wait to the day I can build Babylon 5 embassy station and invite major civs to send their representatives... :P* I miss the persistent after thought: the engine itself would be ideal to work on the first mmo-like 4x strategy game, with more persistant homeworlds fighting for distant galaxies.* Game lobby is awesome, but it could need improvement, so that you can truly find games, which are still waiting in lobby, and waiting for players. I find, people are not making big enough games for this game most of the time. And there is no info which mods run.VerdictTotally recommended for any fans of 4X games. It is the perfect real time game that feels like a turn based game, but isnt, and is very close to the gameplay we all dreamt about - even if it could be more perfect.If you like Civ-like games, Endless games, or Paradox games, Stellaris is a must for you.Gal Civ and Endless space might have some depth and creativity in some regards, stellaris could still need tho.It still feels still a bit like unfinished business sometimes, but its getting a lot of love.

												Probably one of the best 4X Strategy games on the market, Stellaris hits that lovely sweet spot where it keeps sucking you in while retaining an air of mystery during games.Species creation is extremely versatile and exceptionally diverse, games are never the same and the different crises that can occur in the late game really spice things up just when traditional 4X games tend to hit a grind. Stellaris still has elements of that, which is one of its failings (the other being diplomacy, a system games struggle with constantly) and you do find yourself just pushing hard with little feeling of satisfaction towards the end.Simpler than Europa Universalis, more complicated than Civilisation or Total Wars campaigns, Stellaris is in a nice space in the 4X arena at the moment and well deserving of your time			"

												The game is very unfinished. It has VERY solid base and ton of potential. Even in this state there's much fun to be had. I'm not even against a heavy-DLC model that would bloat up the price to 90-100$ since Paradox was one of my favorite developers and I was always happy to support them.However pandering to SJW bigots and pulling mods off the workshop, because they ""might be offensive"" to some gender studies weirdo or the thumblr special snowflake is unforgivable. I'm sorry, Paradox, but I'll never buy anything from you again. It's sad to see that your managment lost their mind and that you don't know your playerbase. What's next?

												Stellaris lacks something to me, replayability. While indeed you can customise your civilisation to your liking, and each small change can affect your game and how you play, this still leaves a very similar experience. What the likes of EUIV has is that each country is unique and will drastically alter how you play. In Stellaris everyone starts off in nearly the exact same position, and you'll be undertaking nearly the exact same actions each time you play, and the map is bland and has no meaning or history (obviously) but it has no significance outside of resources.I have an honest 70 hours or so, the other 100 was spent on the main menu I believe, and while that can be considered good value for money to many people, considering I have over 600 hours on EUIV and will undoubtedly keep going back to it this leaves Stellaris to my mind a bit lacking. I feel it lacks personality, it's bland. As a side note, inter state diplomacy is annoyingly sparse in options and scope. And the sector management is pitiful, committing an entire sector to either energy credits, minerals or science. Forgive me if this has since been added, but there should be an option to maximise each planets resources within that sector based on what's present. You can respect tile resources but I don't believe that means the AI will prioritise what's there, it may instead turn to those tiles last. And as a result many sectors run out of minerals or credits and you have to continually feed them those resources. And if they build up thousands of spare resources they aren't using and you want them? Tough luck, you can't get your mitts on them.In essence, it gets boring quite quickly (again, quickly for a paradox grand strategy). If you want something akin to CK II, Victoria II or EU IV, this is not it. However if you want something like those games but more accessible, this could be for you. But Stellaris, last I played, was severaly lacking in common sense tools for empire management and any kind of attraction for replaying.			"

												Waste of time and money-The early game is really where most of the real game decisions happen. What I mean by that is when you start It becomes a mad grab to colonize as many planets as you can and what eventually happens is you get surrounded by other nations and that's it. The only way to expand is to war with other nations and cede their planets but the war score only allows you to make limited demands so you would have to constantly have to war with the same nation(the bigger it is the longer it takes) in a cycle of war and peace that makes no sense.-If you take over a planet and they start to rebel( which will happen) the planet will prduce nothhing but unhappiness. If the faction bar gets to high the planet's pops attack your army, become independant again and Instantly get a navy more powerful than yours. This breaks the game and and was the last straw for me.-My other problem( and the more larger one) is that when you get to the late game it stagnates. The Galactic ""Situations"" are pretty much ignored by everone. The only way to stay around to take on other nations(most will be in their own federation)is to get in a federation yourself and go to war with them to take ""some"" of their planets. Their really isn't a way to ""Conquer"" the galaxy(Which is required to win)  unless you want to spend 200+ hours on a single game.-By the way for some reason achievements are only unlocked in ironman modeI wanted to like this game, I was even looking forward to when it came out. In the end I was sorely dissapointed and determined this game is a huge time sink, Wasted time and wasted money			"

												I cant help myself but give this game the thimbs up - and I am going to list the good about it immediately. 2.5 hours in and over 60 more watching youtubers like Arumba, Quill, AngryJoe and of course, Paradox, I do not see much bad about the game apart from a number of bugs, more customization options and the start of the game - someone can get a way more favorable one than the rest. I know I restarted 3 times and 1 of those was WAY better than the other two.So this is what I really liked about the game so far:- I LOVE the initial exploration phase. Sending multiple science and war ships to unlock systems and thoroughly scan them for habitable planets and resources is extremely fun and totally scratches my itch for discovery and going where no man has gone before.- I LOVE how easy it is to get into the game. Granted, I might have had help by watching the youtubers, but I could totally get into the gameplay without any hiccups, unlike Paradox's other Grand Strategies EU4 or CK2, where I was totally overwhelmed, even to the point of leaving them back for a long time.- I LOVE the freedom the game gives you. You can play with a pre-made civilizazion, or make your own the way you feel like, which is what I did. I totally recommend people do that - it is so much fun mixing and matching stuff and testing them out. You can be a warmonger, pacifist, mercantilist, mogul, expansionist, whatnot!- I LOVE how the playthroughs can differ from one another. In my 3 starts, I had 3 totally different experiences, based on resources, events, encounters, galaxy composition, star composition, etc. JUST AWESOME!- I LOVE how everything you do feels IMPORTANT and not even remotely boring.- I LOVE how choices have meaningful continuations - not like Civilization Beyond Earth for example, where everything resulted in similar outcome. Here you can either continue a quest line, stop a quest line, drive it to a conclusion that gives you various rewards, and so on.- I like how you get to customize everything after you start. You can let the game guide your hand or go completely wild with your own ship designs, options, and whatnot.- I like the new research system. Stellaris breaks the mold by allowing you multiple research topics at once, which amounts to crazy amounts of research options, based on anything you find through events, dead alien bodies, destryoned alien ships, and so on.- I like how everything in your empire can level up and improve - your admirals, planetary governors, scientists, everything but the little settlers levels up and gets more and more useful as the game goes on.- I like how you are NOT put into a level playing field. Every race has it forte's, and some have been in space way longer than you, which makes them way too overpowered. Like Q in Star Trek.- I like how you can just play the game and have fun.- I like how you can easily make friends and enemies.- I like how the game both holds your hand through quests and missions, but at the same time, does not impose itself on you and lets you do it your way.- I like how the tutorial helps you as you go, not with simple tips, pre-made missions, or pre-made scenarios that have nothing to do with a real game.Conclusion: Paradox did it again - they proved themselves as a developer that carefully chooses its games and drives them to perfection. This games does it all for me - it scratches every itch I may have: exploration, development, diversity, diplomacy, variety, engaging play, everything. I expect dumping hundreds of hours into this game, and pray I have the time for that...			"

												Stellaris is a game that sadly fails to deliver much beyond its initial promise.The gameplay and mechanics should be familiar to anyone who's played 4X strategy titles. Race design and ship design are extremely fun, even if their practical applications are minimal.However, the game hits several major hangups:1) Gameplay is extremely repetitive. The number of ""anomalies"" (read: subplot drivers) is very limited so the game tends to play the same regardless of how you built your empire. There are no real incentives for playing a pacifist or mercantile empire, and the game mechanics don't really inclue a ""trade"" system beyond the existing resources.2) Diplomacy is pretty much nonfunctional. The system design resembles Total War in many ways, but other empires seem to reject completely reasonable proposals, even outright advantageous ones, while accepting completely ludicrous or exploitative proposals.3) Multiplayer setup is maddening. Every time I try to get our group of four together to game I plan on at least 30 minutes of trying to work around the innumerable bugs and issues. For a game that prides itself on its multiplayer focus (being able to save multiplayer games and resume them later, etc.), this is unacceptable.All in all, Stellaris feels like a letdown. I may have to check back on it in a year or two.			"

												While the early game is very enjoyable, as soon as you have colonized a couple of planets, the game gets tedious fast. Single player games suffer from a terribly inactive AI and closed borders, which means there is very often not much to do. To make things worse, lots of the fun associated with micromanaging planet development is gone as you are forced to hand over control to a sloppy AI in the form of sector governors. Either way, it is very clear that the game in the current state is unfinished and will require many more patches and tweaks to become enjoyable. Having played multiple Paradox titles for many hours, I'm afraid that most of the fixes will come as costly DLC's. ( I am aware that Paradox tends to add a free patch to each DLC release, however, the new gameplay features are almost always exclusive for the DLC, which will definitely be needed here)Not worth the hefty price tag.

												TLDR: Fleet combat system ruins the fun and several aspects of the game.At writing the 13.4 hours represent my second game, my first game (~6 hours) was at a friends, and I loved it.The research/tech system is one that most Master of Orion fans will like, the game has 3 research/tech categories. You will be presented a choice in all categories [number of options varies]. When you've completed a research the choices in that category get randomized, meaning you get to pick only between a few of the available research topics. It works well, for making new games different. However there is a problem:Combat currently consists of your fleets getting ""locked"" in combat, and you are no longer able to control the ships. So for my second game, when I had focused on long range, large, fast moving ships [no armor and/or shield]. I got completely destroyed, even though I had 185% the range and 130% engine speed.So if you don't mind that there is a [definitive] right way to play this game, and that you might get the wrong research options repeatedly: you'll have a great time.I think that for the first time they really messed up, I mean EU4 wasn't great on release, but it wasn't this much of a mess.

												Almost half a year after release(!) and even after the (necessary) complete game and UI overhaul that was the Heinlein patch the game is still unbalanced and feels unfinished, still lacking any interesting mid-game and late-game content - there being literally no relevant victory to go for.. Any game just sort of drifts into boringness at some point and you start over. The only enjoyable part is and was the early to early-mid game, which on it's own is honestly not worth the money. It feels almost insulting that there are already 2 DLCs for additional money out there after delievering such a desaster on realease that still cannot be called a complete game. The only thing holding it together is modding community.Maybe wait another half year and look for some bundled sale - the potential is out there.. somewheretl;dr: Whoever thought that it was a good idea to release paid DLC for a game that isn't finished needs a slap.The end.

												Stellaris is really my first venture into true 4x games. To be honest I have so much apprehension to this genre it has always kept me away. I used towatch my friends sink hundreds of hours in Crusader Kings, and EuropaUniversalis 4 and they seemed to love it. I was always sitting in the back thinking, “I don’t want to have to go back to school practically to learn avideo games mechanics and the finer points of the game before I can giveit a try.      So I picked up Stellaris the newest title by Paradox and as someone who is new and was previously intimidated by 4x, I can say with confidencethe game is quite excellent and above all accessible! The game featuresa great level of customization from everything about planet management(buildings, policies, upgrades) to individual ship designs (weapons, power,shielding) as well as empire customization (leader traits, government style,military tech start, etc) The game allows for you to custom tailor your starfairing race to a fine point. As well as the finer details of micromanagementand creating sectors to manage planets under one “system/sector” so that takes a bit of the stress off the individual micro of planets.      The game features a beautiful aesthetic barring performance issues atthis moment of writing it. Giant space battles and honestly when Civs startgrowing and filling the map you are going to see a frame hit. I am runninga 980ti… so there are things left to be desired in terms of game performancebut I have heard they are hard at work fixing these optimization problems. so I do have faith Paradox will work hard on fixing the issues that are affectingthe game currently. They also have given full mod support to the communityso expect some amazing mods and total conversions (BSG,MassEffect,StarWars,Star Trek, etc). Stellaris has a lot it got right and it made it fun for meto learn and to challenge myself to manage my empire better.      The game features fun random events that can be great for your empireor not so great. It also features a random tech tree so you really won't havethe same options a second time in the order you get them in say your firstgame. Which I personally enjoy, take Civ5 for example with an incrediblylinear tech tree, having a random tech tree with “rare” tech etc spices thingsup and encourages you to play differently and focus on what you need orare going for rather than following the same path over and over again. It adds variety and fun challenges to your empires rise and potential fall.      I could talk about the game all day to be honest but I think I will try tokeep this someone concise. Stellaris may be Paradox’s best 4x game yet.I have a new genre to enjoy and sink massive hours into. This is an easyrecommend to veterans of 4x/Paradox games, and even a recommendfor those trying to get into this genre. It’s fun, accessible, and addictive!   "

												I was really on the fence about this game. Some aspects of it are great. The early game exploration is fun. The ability to bring other species into your empire by various means (genetics, politics, enslavement) is cool. It's also fun to have tons of control over ship design and species design.That being said, the game just kind of putters out after a while. The beginning is really great, then it slows down. It feels like something big will eventually happen, but it never really pays off. There is not thought put into the mid-game, and the end game is just not much of a pay off. There are only two victory conditions, which rely on either killing everybody (which is tedious due to the war system) or colonizing tons of mediocre planets (which is tedious due to the terraforming system).Some aspects of the game have a ton of depth, but never really get used. For example, there are tons of different weapon types you can get for ships, but I easily plowed through the game with whatever happened to be the default type for my race. There is a huge galaxy with npc enemies to fight, but they become redundant quickly and by mid game pose no threat at all to anything but lone science ships.This game could really shine, if there were as much depth in the second half of the game as there is in the first. The first several hours are an exciting period of exploration and discovery. The rest of the game is a matter of micro-management in hopes of a payoff that just doesn't come.With some more thought put to the end game (maybe more victory types like ascension or more neat stuff to explore) this game could be truly great. The platform for something awesome is there, it just feels like you end up with nothing cool to do with it after a while.			"

												A pretty good Paradox 4x strategy game, simpler than EU4. You can create pretty much anything from a race of run-of-the-mill humans to space♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ From hippie-dippy xenophile democracies, to hive mind hegemonic empires that expunge all xenos in their path. Ships can be heavily customized and from the very start, you choose which type of FTL and weapons you start with among a few types. Upon the surface of planets and in orbit, you can spread your dominion and destroy or enslave all those in your wake. It is by all accounts a good all-around space 4x, there are however issues.Planetary armies are nigh irrelevant, larger ships take forever to build, and wars are consequently won after one side has had most of their fleet destroyed. In most other Paradox 4x games, there's often the possibility to rise from the ashes and put up another round or more of force against your enemy once you've lost but not here. Exceptionally weak stations in orbit of a planet are the only source of ship construction and can easily all be destroyed before you get more than a destroyer or two out. Without the ability to build a navy from a planetary surface or use ground-to-orbit weaponry, victory is pretty much completely based on fleet strength.In time I'm sure patches and expansions will smooth out combat issues but for now, its a good concept that pretty much makes anything but genocidal hegemonic empires simply incapable of maintaining a serious presence on the galactic stage.

Originally posted by DeliveryGodNoah:There's a 50/50 chance you didn't even know this game was coming out, huh?No sir, when it comes down to a Paradox game, it's 100% for sure. Having pre-purchased so many titiles, I can almost guarantee that no other publishers than Paradox have fulfilled all their promises before release. Not Deep Silver, nor even Ubisoft (LOL). Some quick outline of the game after ~35hrs of playing with yet unfinished campaign (yes, the game progress really SLOW!)The game feels unfamiliar at the beginning, but soon you'll grasp the essense of the game if you come from EU4 (aka very Clausewitz-ish)Very huge galaxy. I went with midium size and I cannot guarantee I have explored all it has to offerA lot to do and try early game, which I enjoy the most. Ship designer was initially a blast to meBeautiful BGM, with nice British accent assistantMet the first alien empire! I tried to be nice, but they are too scared. No, we wont send you to the laboratory...The diplomacy was quite simple, kinda reminded me of Civilization-style diplomacy window. No infiltration, no coveting action, no... royal marriage??? I hope the diplomacy can be more detailed in later patches/DLCsThe game gets hard as I expand my empire. I have a great difficulty keeping the balance positive while fulfilling my gorgeous ambitions. Also micromanagement of each planet really reminded me of provincial management in EU4The later it gets, the more similarity of EU4 I can find in this game. You start up weak, you farm, you research, you build navies, you either be aggressive or continue to farm on... until you are the only one in this galaxyGreat MOD support. I've been using a few nowIn fact, I stopped playing DOTA for a few days just because I wanna spend just one more hour in game... Minor imba issues. Minor graphics glitches. Minor issue with the launcher. Few functions broken. Acceptable given the game's just released ~10d ago*Maybe* less replayability in comparision with EU4?In conclusion, the game is pretty stellar at this price. I hope they can polish it further and add more elements to the game (I know they will, through paid DLCs...) "

												I think this game is a nice mashup of turn-based (Gal Civ) and real-time (Sins) 4x space strategy. It holds up well as a representative of that genre in terms graphics and interface, but I'm guessing you're more interested in what sets it apart from the rest of the pack--for better or worse. For Better:1. The randomized tech tree system is an interesting twist on the usual tech tree. You don't know when you'll see a particular option again, so you really have to weigh each decision. There are occasional ""rare"" cards that show up, too, which are often related to anomolies you've discovered and researched with your science ships. I think all of this is well done.2. You can assign leaders to command fleets, govern planets or sectors, man science ships or research teams, and lead armies. All of these leaders have their own traits and level up with experience. It literally puts a face on aspects that other games leave rather abstract or generic. 3. The ship designer lets you customize your ships if you feel like it. It's not as flexible as the designers in similar games, but it's better than nothing. However, I found it more convenient to just let the AI automatically upgrade my ships as new techs became available. In other words, it turned out not to be very useful (to me), but I still appreciate having the option.4. The music is particularly good. Even after 60 hours of play, I never felt the desire to turn it off or listen to something else instead. Remarkable, really.For Worse:1. The developer obviously isn't a fan of micromanaging. Fine, but instead of allowing you to assign sectors or planets to AI, you're forced to. It's my game; I should be allowed to play it how I want, not how a designer thinks I should.2. Upgrading your fleets take so long that you're better off just destroying or disbanding them and making new ones instead. This isn't realistic and feels wrong.3. It's irritating during an intense battle to have to keep pausing the game to give new orders to a science vessel, construction ship, research team, or hire a new leader after one passes away. It'd be nice if you could somehow supress time so that you could focus on a battle rather than be constantly distracted with this stuff. It'd be nice if you could set your science and construction ships to automatically survey and build stations, respectively. While the system will let you queue up actions, this doesn't work if you don't currently have the resource (minerals, mostly) available. I'd rather it let me queue up anyway, and just perform the action if and when the resource becomes available.In balance, though, I think the pros outweigh the cons, particularly if you're burned out on the classics of this genre. Half the fun (to me, at least) of these games is learning the ropes, and this one is sufficiently different to stay engaging for quite awhile.Following is my Matt Chat review of it.

												There seems to be so much missing from this game at the moment. The AI is poor, race selection is purely cosmetic, the planet battles seem unfinished and the fleet management seems barely started. Sins of a Solar Empire and Sword of the Stars (1, not 2) are much older and much more complete.If you're looking for co-op multiplay this is definately not recommended. A throng of the hardest AI barely stand up to a single human let alone multiple working together.			"

												TLTR: Easily the best and deepest 4X sci-fi ever, with a lot of potential of becoming a good deal better.Stellaris v1.4.1 is not on par with Crusader Kings or Europe Universalis yet, but it has enough deep elements to already rule its pride. There is meaningful racial customization, governmental customization and gameplay mechanics, superb technology-research mechanics, a very interesting universe to play around in and in general enough gameplay mechanics to make the fun last longer than any of its peers.You don't retain full control of your empire. Once it grows to a certain size you must delegate power to AI-governors, just like in other Paradox titles. This is uncomfortable for some players not used to these kind of mechanics, but it's actually good in several ways. First it keeps up the pace of the game, preventing it stagnating into micromanagement-hell. Second it provides depth to the government and faction-mechanics. Third, it provides variety in the empire-management throughout the game. You may not believe it at a glance, but it's actually really good game-design.The game doesen't let you control combat. Like all other Paradox games it focuses on the bigger picture. Combat is conducted by the AI in real-time while you play. It works well when you know the rules for how battles play out. But like everything else in the game, you really need to know what's going on to do anything well. You manipulate the battles by how you design your ships, so you need to teach yourself how to do good ship-design to feel in control of battles. Those who don't tend to dislike this part of Stellaris. Combat currently doesen't look good visually, and has room for functionallity-improvement. Luckily, mods fix some of that already.Diplomacy is good compared to non-Paradox 4X-games. It can get alot better tho, and does have one big glairing fault. It just doesen't give you the tools to peacefully work towards game-victory. That means designing a pacifist and diplomatic race is more of an increased difficulty choise rather than a true playstyle choice. However, beyond a total pacifist gameplay diplomacy works well enough and provide lots of options.Faster-than-light travel is interesting, like Sword of the Stars in that there are different types of FTL with different perks and drawbacks. They can be a little frustrating because FTL is so much faster than in-system sublight speeds that pursuing and catching a fleet that doesen't want to engage you is very hard and often feels impossible. You do get preparation tools that help you do this tho, there are ways to force the enemy to seek an engagement even when they can't win, and they can be tricked into engageing with a weaker fleet while your main fleet chatches up.There are semi-random events both small, big and massive, that break up the routine. There are lot of alien enteties throughout the galaxy that doesen't care about who or what ""rules"", they just live their lives. There are normal alien life that haven't reached the space-age yet, and you can choose how to interact with them. You can help them develop for instance.There is genetic manipulation. There is dangerous researchable technology that can end up dooming the galaxy. There are ancient stagnant empires and races who fancy themselves the true rulers of the galaxy, silently observing the squabbling child-races from their lofty technological peaks. There is marvelous almost game-changeing relics from extinct civilizations. And there are space-pirates and space-locusts.Stellaris will likely see somewhere in between 20 to 80 DLCs throughout its lifespan, accompanied by many more free patches. The game will likely look quite different 2 years from now. That means Stellaris will continue to get better and better over time, but it also means paying for that development if you want to purchase and play this game before it's finally abandoned. It's part of the deal with this game, so only get it if you're ok with that.The modding community is awesome, and they already enhance the game a great deal! Some of the mods are so good that the devs choose to integrate their concepts in the basic game.In all, Stellaris is the best sci-fi 4X by a wide margin. Easy. And I say that having spent 150 hours on a save that ultimately ""failed"" because the game doesen't support the totally pacifist gameplay I was aiming for.			"

												I rate it a 5/10. While it is not a terrible game, it is not something that keeps me hooked. If you plan on buying this as a Civilization-esque real time strategy game with Sins of a Solar Empire combat on a galactic scale, then you are sure to be disappointed. It is sad to say that Civilzation V (with BNW) has more depth compared to something from Paradox; the supposed undisupted champion of grand strategy.The game is extremely fun at first when you start exploring and discovering, but once the exploratory phase is over and about 50-75% of the galaxy is surveyed, there is not much else to do except fight interstellar wars and wait for an end game crises. There are two ways you can currently ""win"" a game and though the conditions for each are different, they are both effectively domination victories. While I realize most players would have gone the domination route naturally, I find it disappointing that is the default way to win. There is much left to be desired, and I am saddened that the void will be filled through future DLCs with what should have been a complete and balanced game from the start; but this is the world we live in now.As far as being called a ""grand strategy game"", there is not a whole lot grand about it, other than expanding your empire to ridiculous sizes with little to no penalties (more on that) and building up your space fleet and armies for the next interstellar war. The game has a name for primitive civilizations you discover on certain planets which are called ""Fragmented Nations""; basically various forms of governments and nations on a single planet competing with each other (like current day Earth). I feel as if a Stellaris game is nothing but Fragmented Nations in a galactic setting as there is nothing to do except go to war. There is hardly any cooperation between species; a hostile empire will never open their borders to you unless it is for a crisis or if you give them everything you own. There is no ability to form a galactic U.N. of sorts. You form defensive pacts and if you have more than four you can found a federation. But a federation is nothing more than a war alliance in which each member gets to control every 10 years, and cooperation between federation members is minimal at best too. If your government is anything but a form of theocracy, then you should not even have to worry about your own populace rebelling. And even if it is, rebellious factions rarely if ever, become a major destabilizing force. You would think the larger your empire gets, the more corrupt it can become and more inefficient it will be. I have not had a single rebellion in my 100 hours so far and to be honest, I care not to play anymore to find out if I can. There is no reason whatsoever to colonize every single planet you come across because why the hell not, there are no downsides to it. You cannot even support rebellious factions in rival empires, something you could do in EU4 with great pleasure. No ability to conduct a proxy war and support a smaller faction indirectly. You have to go in and get your hands dirty. While proxy wars were not a mechanic in Civ V, it was something you could do to prolong a war or prevent a rival AI from taking over your proxy.In its current state, the game becomes extremely mundane and repetitive. It is probably best to wait until they make the game whole with DLC and get it during a sale. There is really not much of a climax, besides the end game crises. You essentially get blue balls. It teases and teases and at the end of it all it just leaves you with no fulfillment.			"

Now that they released a hotfix to the beta which was perfectly fine except for some nitpicking complaints on reddit the entire game is broken and crashes every 10 years at most.  I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down until this is completely fixed.			"

												It's the kind of game that you really want to like but eventually becomes a chore to play and ultimately you regret wasting your hours in it. The core concept is solid but it's mired with design flaws, bugs and glitches.If you've played other Paradox grand strategies you'll instantly recognize the lack of tools to easily process data from yours and others' empires and the interface as a whole is just a work in progress.It's a space opera 4x pseudo grand strategy game that fails to present you with the true wastness of space and exploration, the 4x part is a hit-or-miss depending how they decide to balance it further and the grand strategy part is incredibly shallow.It will be a good/decent game one day, but that'll require at least a year in development and DLC that'll eventually cost triple digits (see Europa Universalis IV and Crusader kings II, good games, mostly good DLC, still pricey as ♥♥♥♥).

												In its current state, Stellaris is a not what I would consider game that is up to the standards Paradox has set with their games.Why?- Bugs. So many, many, game-breaking, fun-destroying bugs but at least with a promise for fixes. See below.- Lack of content. We know Paradox sells games with a lower entry price and lots and lots of DLC expansions. That’s the way they roll, and mostly, it works. At least, it works for their own niche of grand strategy. For a game that supposedly crosses over into 4X territory, people have come to expect certain things, like a proper diplomacy system, or some kind of espionage. Current midgame is incredibly dull.- Clamping brakes on the player. Let me explain. The sector system is, according to the devs, a brilliant way to reduce all the tedious micromanagement. Only that for those people who like micromanagement, the sectors are just as mandatory as for anybody else. Which means that you can keep 5 (10 if you play specifically for core planets) planets under your control. You are then forced to hand the rest over to a broken, dumb-as-bricks AI, which not only makes your empire weaker, it also leads to said empty midgame, because all the nice colony management and tweaking you could spend your time with is stripped away from you. Personally, I don’t buy the micromanagement explanation, I think it’s to slow down human players in comparison to the AI empires, which use the same, broken, dumb-as-bricks sector AI and are generally not the sharpest knives in the drawer.- Horrible UI. This is perhaps the worst of all, because all others are fixable, and are supposed to be fixed in time, with 2 big patches announced for May and June. But the UI is all form and no function. Pause settings? Nope. Message filter? Nope. Ledger? Useful diplo interface? Nope and nope. Proper event log? What do you think you are playing, a grand strategy game by Paradox? … Oh. Right.About the bugs:Want some examples? Sure:- the ethics systems, central to the game, with factions and what-have-you tied into it, is randomly broken. Divergence is all over the place, sometime your whole population looses an ethic tenet completely before you have even finished surveying your home system (read: in 15 minutes of playtime tops)- quest chains that might give you something to do in the otherwise dull midgame break at random, because you got survey data or star charts about a system you were supposed to look at, or just because… well, because.- the battle system is broken. Period. The smallest ships rule supreme, because nothing else hits them.- did I mention the sector AI being broken? Not only stupid, but simply broken, ignoring the few settings you can give it?Now, the bugs are supposed to be fixed by the end of June, when the second big patch hits.The first is currently in beta, but I have not included it in this review because it is currently a mess of back and forth hotfixing (seriously, hotfix deployment on a Friday? That is asking for trouble).Stellaris is not bad. But it is nowhere as good as it could be.If you think about buying, wait until the end of June for patch Asimov (1.2) to land, and do more research then. Buying now will only make you mad if your standards are anywhere near mine. "

												This a 4X game, pausable real-time.As all 4x game, it's a management game, this one is light on the micro management.Honestly, the start of the game is really fun, the mid game is boring as hell, the endgame crisis quite limited and depends a lot on luck. And once you enter mid-game on a big map, it's becomes awfully tedious to progress.I still recommend Endless Space, it's so far, on the 4x games that are light on the micro management, it's IMO still the best in the space opera genre.Honestly, there are too many things missing, the tech tree is missing a lot of the classical techs that any space op game should give us. You can't invest in getting faster terraforming (one step takes 10 years period), you will not be able to terraform barren or tox planets. You can't destroy planets not suns, you can't build ring worlds, dyson spheres. You can't have a deathstar.The diplomatic options are so small that is becomes totally uninteresting too.The game has a LOT of potential the basics are there, but as always with Paradox the game will become great only after 2+ years and 200€ of DLCs...As I already said, Endless Space.

												First impressions of the game.As a paradox fan, I looked forward to this game, so I bought it as soon as I had the chance.I instantly fired up the multiplayer mode, and created my own civilization.I spent a good 20-30 minutes in the creator, just thinking about how I want my species to grow in the universe.After being done with the civ creation we finally were able to start the game. Well we spent another good 10-30 minutes in the first second being paused, as we tried to decipher the things before us. It was a great help, that the full tutorial AI explained everything we clicked on in detail. After mostly figuring out what is what, we started time, and begun to survey the galaxy. Everything started out a bit slow and shaky, but when we got used to the controls it all started to fit in place. After a few hours of gaming you could clearly see the difference me and my friend represent. He with the humans, focusing on expansion and advanced ships, while myself focusing on high level resource management, and fast but precise exploration. To end this wall of text, I think the game is very well able to fit your requirements of an empire you established.This is only my first expression, I'll make sure to put more hours in the game and provide a more deep, fact based analyis.Setis logging off.

												I come into this review with an extensive and colorful background in strategy games. Stellaris is most readily compared to Master of Orion 2, Endless Space, and vanilla Civilization 5, so that's what I'll be using as a benchmark here.My main complaint is that this game seems very unfinished. It plays like a beta. There are only hotkeys for about half of the stuff you want to do, the UI is confusing, arcane and the general empire management isn't really that fun.So let's say you have a gigantic empire of 40-100 planets. If you're good at macroing, well, screw you, since there's a mechanic that punishes you for it. You're not allowed to control more than 5 planets at a time(heavy penalties if you try), and you have to put them into inefficient, AI-controlled ""sectors"" past then, where they can be automatically governed. But the sectors seem to not only make poor decisions, they produce less resources than just owning the cities themselves. It's not very clearly outlined exactly how this works since there isn't an ingame 'civilopedia' or similar, but my biggest complaint is that they don't produce armies or ships during wartime. You have to manually go through your AI-controlled cities, each and every one, and produce ships for your war effort.Thus, my next point; the hotkeys are garbage. There isn't a hotkey to scroll through your controlled planets (that I know of,) there isn't a hotkey to mass-produce corvettes or battleships from their starports (that I know of.) Shamefully, there are some hotkeys, such as changing between the planetary and galaxy view, but the developers seem to have been extremely short-sighted with what does and doesn't have a hotkey.This game is played in real-time, so hotkeys should be numerous and useful. But the game isn't truly real-time, because most of your empire management happens while paused. It feels like a Total War game, where all the macromanagement happens turn-based, and all the combat happens in real-time. There's honestly no reason for there to BE a real-timer on the overworld, and this brings up the settings menu. It is completely barren. There's no settings to turn off random events, or turn off negative ones, or turn them down. There's no setting to change the game between real-time and turn-based. There's no setting to speed up the incredibly slow development in the early game (in civ 5, you can start in the classical or medieval or information eras.) Ingame, there's hardly anything to speed up the incredibly slow development of research. You can build a science facility, giving one research per turn in each of the research paths. But researches start to cost 15,000+ research to complete, and no matter the size of your empire, that will still take 40-80 months ingame time. Unheard of in the 4x strategy genre, there is ABSOLUTELY NO research acceleration. No libraries, no research labs, no gas giants you can colonize to generate huge amounts of research/production/whatever.It plays like a skeleton for future expansions, but I am not optimistic for those expansions. The game, as I find it, is a straight downgrade from Master of Orion 2.			"

												Since the morning of May 11, when I got the game, I've put in 9 nearly straight hours in the game, divided up into three campaigns. From xeno loving humans to religious fanatic birds to materialistically democratic and sedentary lizards, the game has it all, in a package that makes just about anyone go ""SUPERAMAZEWOW!""So, remember how Beyond Earth and its companion game Starships were supposed to give you the feeling of colonizing and exploring alien worlds, but ended up being a bland slog of a game instead? Well, you can forget that game exists, because this unquestionably 4x game kicks it to the curb and stands over BE's unconscious corpse. You have a whole galaxy of rich star systems to survey, harvest, colonize, and if anyone else gets in the way, prepare for♥♥♥♥♥kicking by your trusty space squadrons. Or if you're the kisser type, just engage in diplomatic relations. Whatever works. Like Paradox's other grand strategy games, you have different real time speeds in place of turns - all nicely laid out for the desired flow of your choice.While you get a selection of pre-baked leaders and races to work with from the start, you can (and should) go the extra mile and customize your own race. Peace-fanatic lazy birds? Yeah, why not. Technocratic spiders who stopped worrying and loved the hyperdrive? Go nuts. Eternally happy slugs of the spotless mind? Please do. You have a lot of tools to customize your race so that it plays exactly how you want and looks how you like it - even down to mismashing the styles between the races. Hell, by your selection of racial traits and even your FTL travel choice, you could be playing a completely different strategy from one game to the next. Now mod in dragons and it'll be the perfect game.And I must give special attention to the tutorial system. If Paradox's other grand strategy games left your rudderless and confused, then fret no more, just enable full tutorial and the game will give you the rudders to help you steer, but without outright making it feel like a baby game for babies. Logical quests for what you should do next show up in an interface that's easy to access and with instructions that are clear to follow. The approachability of the game is so high that I'd say it's the best introduction to Paradox's grand strategy games, and an easy gateway to their past library of historical games. And yet, there's a depth where everything feels like it has a purpose, where only a specific set of complexities can be focused on at once.You'll get into the flow. You'll try all sorts of different aliens to play as. You'll explore like a champ, and you'll find yourself in emergent stories that normally takes another game the entire length to tell. You'll be pressured with diplomatic decisions soon enough, who to fight, who to ally with, and who to disintegrate into ashes. Soon, you'll see empires long forgotten and long stagnant, just waiting for the new upstarts to take a slice of their pie. This will create stories of all kinds, should you care to write them down. And if this continues, you'll forget to stop until you've been pronounced legally dead.If you could only pick one game of this year to play, then make THIS the one. Should this game ever start to stale, it'll be at just the right time for more content. Keep your summer months busy just by playing this, and you'll realize sleep is for weak people.The $40 may look daunting, but if you can at all afford it, take the plunge, and fall into the wonderful galactic soundtrack. Very highly recommended.			"

390x couldnt handle it. fps dropped to 7fps constant. 
A Screenshot of Stellaris
By: Yusrin Hadi




Review Update 15/5/16=========================Ive clocked 43 hours, played 2 single player campaign, played 2 multiplayer games (1 with a close friend againts AI, and 1 with 20 random human players -clocked about 6 hours per mp game)Putting few more hours in this game makes me realize improvements can be made in term of User Interface. Once you have a huge empires with 5 sectors and 100 planets, you find yourself performing repetitive clicking to perform one single thing. I thought the point of having sectors is so that micromanagement are no longer needed whislt you focus on building your fleet.Online experience - in battle, its pretty hard to coordinate with your team - steam chat is a must, the built in chat system sucks so bad- notification and awareness - i dont know if my ally is getting attacked, i dont know where theyre getting attack. if only there was a Ping command (like RA2/LoL)AI is very very dumb and you can exploit that to your advantage.But I still recommend the game. Replayability is a pro. Wait for more DLC and community mods to make this game more interstellar.Gaming Experience=====================Bought the game last night. Played tutorial for 2 hours. Went to bed.Came home after work and had a quick nap. Restart a new game. Clocked 7 hours.I spent the first 6 hours expanding, researching  and met 2 alien life forms. One was nice, and the other one was a♥♥♥♥♥♥ I tried to be nice, but the♥♥♥♥♥♥alien insulted me. Expanded into one of his nearby territory and he declared war on me. The 7th hour, I spent my time building an army, Destroyers and Attack ships.Then I realized its 2am and Ive got work tomorrow.=====================Game Review============================Im not a fan of 4X.  Mainly due to it's steep learning curve and annoying UI. I played HomeWorld, but didnt like it that much. However,  I do love is Resource Management and Base Building games. I came from Cities XL, Sim City, Command and Conquer series, so I was suprised to how easy it was to get into Stellaris.I love the simplicity of tech research, attacking without micromanagement, simple UI.Itsworth it. Ive gifted a copy to my buddy so that we can play together. Hes a big time Homeworld lover. Theres no point for me to say much - all I can say is, GET the game, its a ton of fun.			"

												Ok. The game wasn't free but it was gifted to me through steam by a family member. Normally I would be very cautious of buying a 4x. They almost never come out right.But...The game had several mechanics that are foreign to most 4x games I have played.This caused a painful learning curve for me.After getting through that, which took me a2 weeks or so, I'm starting to really like this game.It suffers the issues of most 4x games on release. Has bugs. Exploitable. Not fully fleshed out.But it's better than most modern 4xs.What's better. Maybe sots1 complete. Maybe civ 4 complete.But it's at launch.Totally worth it to wait a few months. I imagine the game will get astoundingly better.The combat is A lot like sins save I can't give any commands other than retreat.It's not my favorite model but way better than say galactic civ.No instances. The ship design is a like a mix between sots and gc3.It's simple but because the combat is sins like it works.The level of detail there is functional.There are a lot of hard counters.But defenses can be mixed and matched.There are some mechanics that are extremely cool.Scientists have traits and these both can change the way they should be used and effect the tech comes.There is not a tech tree exactly.The tech mechanic used looks like it can be made to be expanded to be different for each race or resource available or a bunch of stuff.Time will tell there but it looks like it could be dlc.The game can suffer from forcing a certain style of lag to have the game be fun.It can be really dull in some cases and a whole lot of fun in others.For me I have to be a bit war hungry to keep the gang interesting.The war aspect feels good to me.I don't use simply huge armies to roll the target. The last war I was in I had three and the enemy still slipped a force through and started causing trouble.I like that.All aspects of the game require thought.Bottom line... it's OK but can get really boring in doing play styles or situations.Finding an enjoyable way to play makes it quite a lot of fun.And it's going to get better. I would imagine over the next 3 years that this game will be the legendary game I have wanted since moo and mom. "

												I'm going to keep this sweet and simple.Love it. Hands down, love it. The sounds, music, artwork. Everything looks and feels right. Not overly complicated but some matches can be quite epic, lasting days. What seems to be a massive amount of interactions, choices, and dialogue; all boil down to the same type of inputs. (I'm getting at it's really not that complicated of a game to play). Think of this game as kind of a Sins of a Solar Empire meets Civilization, though, actually less complex IMO (once again). Plays like an RTS yet still feels turn based.Price seems about right IMO but with this being Paradox, be ready for some DLC to ask for more money. Making a decently priced game a lot more for what might be so little added. Time and reviews on that topic will tell. (Snowfall for Cities Skylines comes to mind).Things that could make this game even better IMO.-Bug fixes and they are underway. Stuttering issue is fixed. (Thank god).-Even more race appearance. There are just under 100 right now but I want more gosh darn it. The art and little animations add to the great feel of the game. Sure, there will be mods but I want original.-More instances for scientific research and events. There are a ton in game as is but I've run into a few repeats.-Finally, there are ultimately two kinds of victories you can opt for. Would be nice if we could get maybe a scientific victory, although, I guess that would work against fallen empires.Basically it's enjoyable enough that I just want more of every aspect.Cheers!			"

												Disclaimer: I have a combined 600+ hours in Paradox's Grand Strategy Games alongside numerous multi hundred hour 4X games in the past. This review is made after playing 2 full games with a combined total of 39hours. I did not watch any Stellaris Let's Plays hence this is me diving head first into Stellaris.From a glimpse, Stellaris is a solid 4X game with major innovations and improvements over other 4X games. Stellaris trumps other 4X games with its solid storytelling mechanics, dynamic AI personalities, asymmetric start and numerous configuration options in the form of mods, species creator.Comparing Stellaris to other more seasoned GSGs like Crusader Kings II and Europa Universalis IV leaves a lot to be desired as it is not as fleshed out. More updates and DLCs will certainly improve the game, however as of the current Patch 1.4 (Kennedy), the game can be considered as the best 4X space game there is. There aren't any other comparison out there that packaged 4X space games any better than Stellaris in terms of UI and mechanics. I understand Stellaris is usually compared to Distant Worlds: Universe and Star Ruler 2. However bad mechanics and complicated UI (read: micromanagement) makes them unimpressive. In terms of depth, Stellaris might not be as deep  as SR2 and DW:U as they are more fleshed out.With that, let me describe the pros and cons of the current Stellaris.Pros:- Dynamic storytelling that weaves itself into your galaxy.- Multiple ways of playing your empire. Become a warmonger and expand or build tall and expand slowly through diplomacy. Build a federation and liberate other homeworlds or to ban slavery. - Sector AI reduces micromanagement. Yes, this is a pro as AI can be tasked to manage your sectors while you manage your core planets. The sector AI isn't up to par compared to a human player, but that is to be expected as you're basically tasking a minion to take care of your planets and systems. You do have the ability to spend influence to enact edicts on sector AI planets and construct Spaceports, Orbital mines and Orbital research centers. Only tile management is automated.- Very contextual UI albeit with some minor annoyances (compared to other 4X games). You're not constantly fighting the UI to perform some simple tasks, though it could use some improvements in terms of tile management and fleet management.Cons:- Less fleshed out economy. With credits and minerals being the only resource for your economy, less emphasis is done on trading. Only way of trading it is with other empires. There are local economy management and tile based micro management/planning, but that is only done once and upgraded continuously. No civilian economy as well.- Hands off battle. This might be a pro for people who are averse to micro managing fleet battles as your option is to either fight or retreat. Basically the same as what EU4 and CK2 offers.- Diplomacy for war leaves a lot to be desired as compared to other GSGs. No espionage, no way to influence a war by using other methods other than a straight up fight. You do have ways to prolong the war so that your enemy collapses from unhappiness and use guerrilla tactics to cripple their economy by destroying mines and research stations or blockading planets.- Diplomacy with other empires are limited as well. No way to helpfully interact with other empires of opposite ethos other than war.			"

												i want so badly to love this game, and am hoping desparately that Paradox will continue to revise and reforge it into what it has the tremendous potential to be.  as of now, the game's pace and mechanics both slow the rate of progress for the player to such a degree that i legitimately feel bad about myself for the time invested in any long play session... and to play through a full game would take *sooo many* long play sessions.  i have the utmost faith in Paradox and personally believe that they are one of the preeminent developers in modern strategy gaming, so i am ok with shelfing this title in anticipation of a more rewarding revisitation someday, but at present time i am sad to say that i regret making this purchase.

												The game surely needs to be polished in regards of some UI elements and Diplomacy aspect. But don't forget, this is a Paradox game, so we can actually be pretty sure they'll look into it and in few months we'll have absolutely perfect game.Those are the complaints. However the atmosphere, nice learning curve, plentiful of events, race designer and possibilites are more than good. If you ever wanted to have true sequel to Master Of Orion 2, this is it (although in real-time). Even though mid-game is little bit sluggish (again, nothing that Paradox wouldn't fix either in patches or expected DLCs), the game is fun as hell and you'll definitely lose your sense in time in real life.So yeah, there are some issues but nothing that would ruin your experience or was inherent to the game itself. For now on, I would give 8,5/10. After some polish it would be easily 10/10. So jump on the train with us right now and have some fun.			"

												Game feels empty right now. its sad because the game is superb when you first start it but after 5 hours or so, the AI doesnt do anything and you realise the game is disappointing as little thought was put into late game.Sectors also need a huge revamp. For the people that don't own the game, sectors are planets and zones that you give to the AI to manage for you.Sectors need to build ther own military and need to beable to defend themselves as they take up the stardocks,planets and the resources they generate. Right now, sectors become such a heavy burden when you are big and go to war which defeats the whole of making sectors in the first place.The research/tech tree also has no personality. there are no 'unique' techs like wonders in civilization. The game itself has no 'Tree' and instead it gives you 3-4 random research and on your first few play through, you will end up waddling around several 'branches' because there are prerequisites that you have to go through. For example, if you want to unlock devastator missiles, you need to finish all the tiers of nuclear weapons but the game doesnt tell you that.Events like civil wars and rebellions also hardly happen unless you mess up big time which is disappointing. Plot blockers such as volcanos or monsters are just for illustration purposes, they do not do anything besides hinder you which doesnt give you a sense of urgency to research and unblock them and instead it is better to just concentrate on expanding all through early game since pirates dont spawn either.One thing that makes this game stand out from the rest is it's quest system which is written really well but these seem to disappear when you reach the mid game. Wars are also objective based and you do not war against a 'race' or 'faction' like in other 4X games, which means that if you are in an alliance and the AI declares war on your ally, you cannot stop the war and is forced to participate.The combat AI is also rediculously stupid. the AI targts weak and defenseless ships first so if you are going to fight against someone with a larger stack, you just need to embark all your armies 1 by 1 which will become 24hp transport ships and the fleet will attack these ships slowly before deciding to hit your main fleet which would have obliterated the enemy's fleet. (if you have more money, you can design cheap,fast and evasive corvettes which will do more damage instead of transport ships)The AI also abuses this which makes it fustrating as you have no control over what happens in combat. (6 battleships that give you around 7-8k MP would lose to a 50 or so corvettes which would be around 4-5k MP, or 8 battleships with 22 destroyers- around 27-28k MPwould lose to 30 transport ships and 50 corvettes/1 battleship- around 11-12k MP)MP = military power which is used to decide the strength of your units/fleet			"

												Salutations fellow gamers!I just wanted to write a quick first impressions review of Stellaris so far. I am only 3 hours into it so far but so far its been great! I have a good number of RTS and 4x strategy games. Only a few of them are Paradox Interactive games such as Mount and Blade, War of the Roses, Magicka, King Arthur Strategy Game, and of course now is Stellaris. My class mates have been talking it up for the past few weeks and enticed me to finally get it on release day and I am very pleased with it.For a strategy game it is very fluid yet methodical. When I say this I am thinking in my mind that this is a slight hybrid of Endless Space and Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion (both of which are great). Yet, this game is fluid without turns and you can even adjust the time to even pausing the game. This also is in effect in multiplayer but more on that later.________________________________________________________________________________Cost: It varies on what edition you get of the game, I personally got the Nova edition because it comes with a portrait species (literally only cosmetic, no effects on gameplay apart from just an alien spider like Arthropod archetype species) as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack is definitely worth the extra cost for its great quality and good atmosphere. Though for those who are into the game alone then just get the base game, the upper tiers of editions are really only cosmetic and support of the developers (along with social goodies such as forum badges, though that may I have changed by now). I would say for the quality of game it is in right now, it is worth the $50 I spent for the Nova edition.Gameplay is rather unique and I do not think I gave it justice by implying it was a hybrid of Endless Space and Sins of a Solar Empire because it is a really interesting and great style of play. Generally speaking it is just like any other RTS where you develop your empire and encounter other species with differing responses. The empire creator by the way is wonderful and very finite, with editing the style of government and its ethics (all very compliced and not going into it with this first impressions, essentially just traits of your empire but could have different styles based on choices. There are a specific trait system that balances out with negatives and positives, much like Zomboid character traits, etc.) All in all the gameplay is typical for anyone who has played an RTS/4x game and I had no problem picking up the mechanics within the first 10-20 minutes.Multiplayer is very interesting because supposedly it can go beyond 32 players (not recommended for ease of play). It is very simple to play with friends and even random people, though I would sit down prior and create your own empire if you so choose to rather than making everyone wait. The only gripe I have with multiplayer is that the thing I mentioned about controlling time is available to everyone (no clue if there is a host option to limit power or not). So at first people were pausing and slowing/speeding time up for EVERYONE so we had to set up some ground rules. All in all very fluid, my friends experienced minor lag problems but nothing hindering playability (could've been my friend's crappy internet hosting).For a game that I never heard about until the last few weeks, it is a suprisingly great game that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good RTS/4x game much like Endless space/etc. If you have friends than more the merrier because I've been enjoying playing with them quite a bit. This has been my first impressions and I give it a good thumbs up! :)- :sphere:			"

Product received for free
												It's neither 'XCOM of space 4X' nor 'Master of Orion' kind of game. And it's built like 'EU/HOI brought to space', not other way around like 'MOO with EU/HOI upgrade'. And I'm not 100% sure this formula is the best one for the masses.Be prepared for very complex grand strategy with events, vassals, policies, edicts and complex decisions, e.g. 'should I take +10% research for the cost of -15% ethics divergence and what does it even mean?!' The game is not turn-based but plays like one as you can press pause anytime and you have full control over the speed.What I find particularly appealing in this game: I've never seen anything like this in space and I'm happy such a game is finally here. If most of the fun for you is figuring out how everything works - then this this game is definitely for you. At least that's how it feels for me and I love it. From CK/EU/HOI perspective, the game also feels fresh, not like some kind of mod.Other notes:+ It feels different than other (AKA 'we are trying to remake MOO2 here') 4X space games.+ Race builder is good, so many options to play with.+ Research tree looks more like EU/HOI game, with three branches and assigned research leaders. Which I find fresh and good.+/- There's ship designs, which is good, but this and other features like Galaxy/System maps together make it the most complex games of Paradox Interactive.- Overwhealming with information at first, even though the UI is good.- Feels like managing dozens of planets might be burdensome, but I only wait to get to it.- Space exploration is not giving me thrills but maybe I've played too many of those games.

												It took me a little time to get into this game, but it was worth it, and I'm still learning stuff.  Yes, the game has a long learning curve. I suggest, at least for your first few attempts at playing, to run it with the tutorial-level advice turned on. That won't tell you everything, so it's good to bookmark the wiki page, and to ask questions in the Steam forums (people there have been very helpful, even though I felt like I was acting like a total newb).In short, this game is a 4X on steroids.  Things starts very slow and you'll have lots of choices to make, especially if you choose to design your own race. There's a lot of levels to the game, but you really don't have to understand everything at the start.  I suggest starting out like I did, following the 'missions' in the tutorial.Eventually, your empire will get bigger, and then you'll be forced to split everything up into sectors.  Sectors are the games way of dealing with micromanagement.Also, you'll need to choose leaders based on their cost and traits.  You'll need to pick 3 main research leaders/scientists in each of the 3 main tech trees.  You'll need to pick at least one military guy to run your battle fleet or fleets, and you'll need to assign scientists to science vessels. If you have an army, you'll have to assign a general for that as well.You'll find any number of different anomalies while your science vessels search the stars around your home planet, and you'll be given decisions to make, the simplest one being, do you commit that ship to analyzing a dangerous anomaly (because there's often a chance of your leader dying). You may have a chance to analyze some some ruins or recover information from a recent combat, or dig up an ancient spacecraft, or initiate a much longer 'mission' to collect biological samples across the galaxy.Also, depending on your form of government, you may have to deal with elections, and that opens up whole other side of the game: Politics.  With the race I'm playing now, I only have to replace my Empire's leader when the previous one dies, and because I'm in a kind of 'scientocracy' (that's not the name, just that I can't recall what its called), he's selected from my current scientists, and each one has an agenda. You can push for a specific candidate by spending influence, or you can just not do anything, and let things happen as they will.  Each leader has a specific agenda, and will give you different advantages for the duration of his term.Anyway, that's the game in a nutshell.  In my current game, there are 1000 systems (I hesitate to call them star systems, because a few have black holes or quasars or pulsars at their center), and each system can have any number of planets and asteroids.If I were forced to compare it to other science fiction 4X games, I'd say that ""Sword of the Stars"" comes the closest, especially with the different choices of travel mechanisms, and random events, and so on. I'd say if you like SotS, yoiu'll probably like Stellaris as well.			"

												I got this game together with a friend as a nice strategy game to play together. Although it has some flaws, I enjoyed it both in singleplayer and mutliplayer. Most of those downsides Stellaris has right now are getting resolved by the devs right now. They post dev diaries now and then and from what they announced for the next update it looks like a lot of said flaws will be fixed.The main problem is yet to be resolved though and that is that you cannot play for the win and enjoy it.There are only two objectives that let you win the game: Either you defeat all other civs in the galaxy, or you colonize 40% of all habitable planets. As long as you don't play an extremely aggressive or extremly expansive civ, those are both basically unachievable. There are so many good gameplay elements in Stellaris like migration, ethnic influence, dynamic tech tree, ... that I'm a bit confused that they didn't take advantage of any of those to create individual objectives depending on which type of Civ you play. You select traits and ethics in the beginning that give you advantages and disadvantages in different areas. E.g. a civilization with the materialistic ethic gets a bonus on research while a militaristic ethic boosts your ships attack stats. Why not make the objectives depend on these? E.g. you could make it an objective for materialistic civs to research a certain tech and build a special building. I hope they work on this.Other from that I think it's a very decent strategy game. I can only recommend you to play it with friends, that's even more fun. Designing your own ships is a giant pro and considering they'll improve fleet tactics significantly in the next update it gets even more interesting.All in all: A very nice game with some flaws which is worth its money			"

												Note that this is written for 1.2 and may become outdated in the future.Stellaris on launch showed a ton of promise but didn't really deliver on that fact. Patch 1.1 did a bit to rectiy this. Patch 1.2 did more.Both of these patches were major overhauls. Patch 1.3 looks to be the same.All of these patches were free.Paradox didn't do the best job with Stellaris on release. They have however done an amazing job supporting it. The game is going places, and definately worth looking into and following, if not buying it outright.			"

												This game is awesome - until you realize that the AI is abysmal and is insanely bad at doing anything.It's as if you are playing soccer, and you're like ""Man I'm doing great yo"", but you look over the shoulder and realize that the rest of the players have no legs or arms and are kinda just smiling and waving their arm stumps at you.Summed up, the AI works as following:If player fleet power is lower than mine > Be hostile and actively harass player and attack their territoryIf player fleet power is higher than mine > Do nothing - EverThe AI never uses any kind of strategy either, it will create a stack (of ships), and as soon as war is declared they will send their stack of ships against yours, and whoever wins the battle has won the entire war. That's it.Like, they wont regroup or recover, because past that point all they will do is continuously build single ships and send them on suicide missions against your fleet.The AI will never collaborate with other AI either, they don't do joint attacks, and rarely if ever unite against a threat, even if that threat is you, and you are a xenophobic fanatic purifier that is actively genociding the galaxy one empire at a time.The AI is also incompetent at managing resources and researching, and you'll often find planets that are say, exclusively food producers. Like, several planets, dozens and dozens of planets, that produce nothing but food.I think you can see where this is going considering that you get severe tech research penalties the more population and planets you have.I also never once saw them build megastructures of any kind, or really even get Jump Drives or anything either.Diplomacy is also fantastic, in the sense that it isn't, at all.In fact don't even bother playing Pacifist or Fanatic Pacifist, unless you are a complete masochist or want a game that lasts for half an eternity, because your options boil down to:a) Aggressively do Liberation Wars and also be so powerful that friendly empires will just straight up surrender to you and ask to become your Vassals.b) Build a Federation and cry yourself to sleep whenever a singular Fallen Empire decides to declare war on one of your allies and promptly goes on to murder all 13 of you because one of them glanced in the same general direction the FE was at.c) Do literally nothing and wait for the Unbidden to show up and absolutely trash everyone else. Then trash the Unbidden.You get, three flavors of AI aggressiveness and three flavors of AI difficulty.Low to High aggression: Pretty much all the same, only changes how likely they are to declare war on you in general.Difficulty levels: Does absolutely nothing for the AI ITSELF, but rather determines how many cheats they get enabled.So on Normal they are on equal levels with you, no cheats.Hard = Get 50% more energy, minerals and research, and can also build 50% larger fleets.Insane = Same as above, but 100% instead.None of that even means anything because the AI is incapable of taking care of itself, and once you've passed the magical threshold of ""player has more fleet power than AI"", you have basically won over the AI.There is so much more to talk about too, like how completely meaningless and poorly implemented the whole planetary invasion/land warfare mechanic and ALL of its related research/buildings, etc is, or how the multiplayer seemingly doesn't work for random people, but why even bother really?The game has it's moments, like the events, which have interesting little stories to them and whatnot, there's also mods if you wanna roleplay I guess, and it's pretty fun for your first few starts while everything still feels new and cool.Get it on sale, if you can look past the genuinely awful AI.

How long did it take me to get tired of singleplayer? 20 hours. As such a negative review seems in order. The game is a blast for the first 10-20 hours but it loses its charm very quickly.However i have over 100 hours playtime, how is this possible ?  The answer is simple, Multiplayer. I have had the pleasure of taking part in a multitude of organised and public stellaris multiplayer games. Multiplayer is constantly fresh and exciting and i cant in good faith give this game a bad review considering how much fun iv had these past few weeks with it. So yeah hold off untill its on sale with the DLC if your more into singleplayer.EDITthe recent free patches have massively improved the gameEDITSadly it also screwed over multiplayer BOOOOO			"

												This is the first 4X game I've actually played and I'm impressed. The scope of the game is massive! Be that the size of the 'game map' or the actual amount of things to manage/do. And it isn't all about combat either! Nice balance of diplomacy, exploration and combat make this game much more than just steamrolling the enemy like in other strategy games. I'm new to this genre so maybe don't take my review into account quite so much as other people who are clearly veterans of genre and know what they are talking about, however having previously spent a lot of game time in the Total War franchise this is a refreshing change and I'm enjoying it so far.

You cant really control anything, it just kind of happens and is overwhelmingly anticlimactic everytime. Sorry for the neg reveiw!  But I can't even express my dissapointment in this regard.

												Since Paradox Dev. Studio released the latest update(Heinlein, 1.3), I decided to revise my review.Most of previous issues are now addressed.- Fixed game-breaking bugs.- Mid-Endgame is even more enjoyable by adding awaken fallen empires.- Visual enhancement also gives you immersion.- More pre-gameplay options are available.By their release of Heinlein patch, Stellaris got closer to perfection.This is the space 4X game I've waited for a long time.Developers listened to us, and they managed to make this game almost flawless.The modding community is awesome, too.If you like Grand-strategy genre and space exploration, I definitely recommend this game for you.

												The hype was a lie. I was really excited when they announced Stellaris as I love 4X games and they promised this one will be different. More complex in diplomacywith new features and interesting mid and end game. I'd read every dev diary, watched Blorg streams and pre-order the game. Now I regret that.Early game is really good and fun, but when you reach the mid game and create first sector, it gets boring. AI is dull, very passive, doing nothing. Diplomacy choices? Very poor and the communication options are still the same (even they'd promised that this one will be more complex than in other 4X, it isn't).Trading? There is none.Maybe modes or dlcs' can'll fix a lot of gameplay issues, lack of features or removes some stupid limitations.So far 6/10, won't buy again.			"

												Very poorly optimized, it will only utilize 1 of your CPU cores and it still runs in 32 bit. Your CPU is basically the only part of your computer that will matter in this game as well.My CPU is at the recommended specs of 3.3 Ghz, and yet after 150-200 years in game I'm sitting at 10-25FPS. Really annoying and makes it really difficult for me to stay in any campaign on the largest galaxy size.With that said however, until I hit that point where I start feeling the bad optimization, I have to say this game is practically flawless for me. I got exactly what I expected/wanted and for that reason highly recommend this game, but don't be surprised when 30-45 hours into a playthrough your frames drop to hell.			"

												Not grand strategy. More like Rock-paper-scissors strategy.Like many Paradox games this game seems to have lots and lots of options for different strategies. This is however only superficial.Yes, there are tons of research to be made. Many many different combinations of ships and races. 90% of it does not matter. Most techs are only numerical increases of stats and does not change any underlying strategy or tactic. There are for example Torpedoes I, II, III, IV, V etc, which can be researched, still just torpedoes. And who cares if you build torpedoes or lasers. Just get the fleet with highest combat power and dominate your neighbors. The configuration of your fleet matters very little, only overall power.  If you are unlucky enough to have a weaker navy and loses it, then you are pretty much game over. I still didn’t want to give up on the game. But I recently stumbled upon a bug with one of the end game events, the Prethoryn Scourge. They invaded one of my planets and within seconds purged all of my pops. The game treated this as if I had purged my own pops giving me 5% unhappiness per pop purged. Which got all my planets to 0% happiness. This causes a chain effect of losing all production and energy and when you are out of energy your fleet lose 90% of its power. All other nations registered me as week and some declared war. Uprisings on all my planets.  The unhappiness penalty continued for years and years.  No way to turn it around.After having invested several days of creating your empire this was a very lame way to lose it. It also shows how poorly this game is thought through strategy wise.			"

												TLDR: good game, but unfinished.I don’t want to bore you is just state that I played a lot of Strategy Games.This Game is promising, the Style is nice and the Graphic isn’t bad, not good but usable.There are no real innovative, you saw everything in this game before somewhere else so get this right out of the way.Building your Empire is Straight forward, explore, settle, profit but you cant Control everything.After 5-6 Planets you have to give up to your (dump) Sector AI and can go to find more Planets to Settle.While exploring there are some Anomaly’s to find, they Range from Resources to Ships or Upgrades. From now to then there are short quests like “Explore X Planets” or “bring back some pets” to find, but the Variety is so low that you find them Boring after a few starts.After a while you will encounter other Empires, some of them are Fallen empires which are Mostly useless, ignoring them works well. Diplomacy is mostly standard declare war, find like minded friends, rivals and Vassals.Combat is like in any other game of this kind Rocket, Laser and Mass driver with Armour and Shield so there is nothing more to say.At every Corner there is a hint of Gratenes and then their is this dead end.The AI is pretty weak, one small fleet to distract his whole Force.UI isnt flashed out, there are images missing and so many useless information.Combat its just a ball of ships ticking their HP away.Diplomacy is missing Crucial things like demand open borders or demand tribute, things that are in mostly any game out there.Events are so few they seem boring after the 3rd or 4th start.All in all this feels like an Early Access game, not a release.

												In a nutshell; combat is insipid, wars are broken if you have allies, as is sector system which is mandatory. The ""honeymoon"" period wore off really fast once early game ended.Don't be like me, listen to these complaints and don't buy the game thinking it's tolerable to get to the game underneath, too many of the X's in a 4X game have been ruined here.

												The best space grand strategy so far! What I love about it, you are not forced to choose a ""war"" path in order to win the game, I completed one game without a single war with neighbours and instead formed a large federation and fought against *** during a crisis event.On the other hand, in my next game I'm a militaristic leader who suppresses, conquers and cleanses alien life forms. You are free to choose.Game is also very well balanced with different technologies and perks for different species.			"

												Its a 4X game. and i like it !!!!! So much i took quite a few 4hour sessions after work.Cant say much games have had me want to do that the last couple of yearsIts a good game.  But Its starts as a real great game. After u get to the late game, the events dry up a bit and the game slows down.(Something the developer acknowledges and promises to make better in future updates)Im not sure how much that will improve the game, but even without it, this is a solid 4X game with nice backstories and some nice mechanics.Maybe not the second coming of 4X jesus as some people were hoping,.  but still a great game !I cant remember the last game that so absorded me, and made me want to have ""just one more turn""BTWTo each his own opinion.  But if u look a lot of negative reviews, people put up here.  the people who wrote it put 40+ hours into that game in a single week.  IMHO  if u want to spend that time with a game , its a good game :)			"

												I tried to get into this game, I really did. More than forty hours of trying.ProsThe species graphics are beautiful.Some really good ideas about keeping down complexity, like mining/research outposts.The GUI works well and I found the game pretty easy to pick up.ConsThe game is excruciatingly slow, even on the ""Fastest"" speed.After the initial exploration and expansion, nothing interesting ever happens.Diplomacy has no interesting options or outcomes.In the end, I'd still rather play Master of Orion II, sorry. I will revisit this game (and this review) after the planned updates. It may yet become a good game, but I am not too hopeful.			"

												Utopia patch - reviewThe game feelt polished and most bufixes from my orginal review where adressed to the point that i where about to change my review to positive, that is until this patch hit. Now there are new game mechanics which the ai doesnt interact with. No explanations ingame for the new mechanics (tooltips where actually pretty good just before the patch).Basicly its release all over again, a plethora of bugs and no tooltip information.So my tldr stands. If your a fan of this game then you will probably get over the bugs and missing information for everyone else i cant recommend this.______________________________________________________________________________Original reviewStellaris is a game with great potential. I love it for what it is.However its not in a finnished state.-Bugs, Fleets bugging out (in various ways), Transports cant flee, events getting stuck.-Ethics are completly unbalanced for achieving ""victory"".-Diplomacy is nonexistent, partly because of the ai.-The Ai, sigh.-The UI, come late game with large empires you feel like you have to wrestle the ui just to keep your empire running smoothly.If you are a fan of games in space and with a grand strategy scope (its not that much strategy once you have a plan, decided on your race and seen the area around your start) then i can recommend it.For everyone else i dont recommend this game in its current state. I will keep this updated overtime.			"

												Canot recommend this game, the late game is utterly broken. Not only on an actual gameplay value, micro management of vast areas and fleets of space grows dull very quickly the situation log, one of the interesting parts of the early game all but dries up to nothing and diplomacy or at least certain aspects of it leave you in a situation where you either stand by yourself and get the floor wiped with you or stand with a Federation and then have no say in who or what you declare war on because your fellow members spend all their time declaring war on your behalf without ever giving you a say or opinion on the Warscore goals (a feature by the way that does not work both ways, i.e if you declare war they get a chance to veto the vote unless you give them a shot at some Warscore goals.)You also have the issue with late game battles, you have four classes of ship as a player you think biggest ship equals the best, lets build vast fleets using them, nope the reality is the smallest and weakest ship is the best, in fact the entire game can be played without ever needing to build anything but Corvettes. Don't believe me watch as your 75K Battleship fleet gets torn to pieces by the AIs 20K fleet that comprises of mostly smaller ships (the AI clearly knows which ships are best.)The other issue is on the games technical level, the game is 32bit and uses a single core which is frankly pathetic in this day and age and while this isn't an issue in early game once you get to late game with huge fleets, and huge amounts of background stuff going on the game becomes an utter chore, everything chugs along, command inputs get ignored of delayed (watch as you click a button to reroute a fleet only for it to ignore you) it is utterly pathetic. (4690K I5 at 3.6Ghz with a 980GTX)The game needs some serious fixes, the gameplay elements can at least be fixed, by various levels of degree but the technical issues. I doubt it, if and if they fix both sets of flaws I will change my recommendation, I suspect that it will remain unchanged though.			"

												Well, without putting too fine a point on it, this game has gripped me like no other game this year. It's been a long time since I was as enthusiastic about anything as I am about Stellaris. From the moment I started playing, I was hooked. My first empire was a collection of racist, collectivist insects that came to dominate the spiral arm they were born on within 150 years. Then I managed to♥♥♥♥♥♥off a Fallen Empire, who promptly destroyed all of my ships in a very one-sided war. Everyone else I'd annoyed with my earlier expansion (and constant genocide...) decided to jump in and take me to pieces like hyenas at a carcass. I had a few more non-starter games where I was crushed before the century was out, (protip: if you don't feel like having this happen, you can turn 'advanced AI starts down and lower the chances you'll start next to someone big who hates you for existing) but then I decided to roll chill science-y space lizards. Now, this is where I have problems with the game in its current form. It was easy from an RP perspective to knock out the empires around me who wanted me dead and burned, but once all of them were gone and I had nothing but nice neighbours, there was pretty much nothing to do. Some of them would have joined an alliance with me, but for some reason that reduces your influence per month, which I needed for lots of things. The rest of them pretty much didn't want anything to do with me. I couldn't travel through their territory with my science ships because we weren't allies, and we couldn't be allies because I needed the influence/they weren't up for it. Which left me having to declare nonsensical wars just to be able to spread out a bit.There's a lot been said about how the diplomacy side is lacking, and I think that's probably the root of my problems. The other stuff, (strangely scaled UI, combat looking really strange, no map filters) I could either live without or mod in, but not having anything to do in the mid-game is not really something modders can fix. I'm pretty confident PDX are going to support Stellaris for a long time, and I doubt they'll leave things the way they are for long, but I guess it's a bit of an oversight to have the middle portion of the game have almost nothing to do in it. Especially considering the endgame crises are excellent (if they fire properly) and early game is serious fun. Should you buy this game? That depends. I've put nearly 100 hours in since release, and I don't regret it. As a reader of classic sci-fi, an ex-40k player and a keen fan of Paradox Interactive, I'm probably going to be a little bit biased. This is essentially an early Christmas for me. However, the polish just isn't there. If you're on the fence (and you probably are, if you're reading this review) I'd advise you to wait a few months before you dive in, or maybe wait until a sale. If you're not too bothered by the things I've mentioned above and are as massive a science fiction fan as I am, you should just buy it already.			"

Setting it to super fast and watching bars fill?  :-/I have far too many hours in to return it (and even more where I paused it and left it on all night), but I would if I could.

												I just can't recommend this yet.If your looking for a tactical battle sim, by all means, this is a great game.But the sheer lack of diverse paths is remarkable.This is all because of one problem; the AICons of the AI:1. Hates your guts, even those xenophiles   a. In every game i've played, about 90% of the AI will hate me the entire game, and the remaining 10 will love me, but       will always be pathetic in comparison to me               b. The NewContent adds the ability to become a Hive Mind. Was great fun, till I found other people, who hate you        simply for being a Hive Mind. The hate of Hive Minds is greater than the love of xenophiles2. They can't successfully form a federation.    a. Tried this once. Could only get 1 member because everyone hated me. Then everyone hated him. Then he tried to         our (my) federation to go to war. With a boss faction.3. How they start. When creating a game, you get the option to choose how many AI, how many OP AI, and how many    ""strong"" AI.    a. It's all BS, because there are only 2 kinds of AI. Weak enough to crush (1/10), or strong enough to wipe out your        entire fleet.Now we reach my complaint. (^ That's problems with the game)In the ""diplomacy"" tab, it shows each empires fleet power, fleet size, and technological advancements in comparison to your own. Most AI will have:Fleet Power: EquivalentFleet Power: EquivalentTechnology: EquivalentThis is BS. It's just all BS. Show, if you REALLY want this game, here's a new definition of equivalent:Equivalent: A rough estimate that is decided based upon how many stars you can see multiplied by 0, and then added to whatever you pocess squaredThere are other problems with this game, but really, don't get this game UNLESS:1. You will soley play Multiplayer2. You love constant war and torture (yourself and others)3. They release a patch/content update fixing the stupid AI			"

												Long time Paradox fan. Review of the initial release.Stellaris is an attempt at fusing the Galactic Civilizations / Masters of Orion games with Europa Universalis. As such, it is fairly successful as a proof of concept. The game has a wide amount of content and great writing. Sadly, under the veneer it is extremely shallow. Basically the game needed another year of development to flesh out. Knowing Paradox, that will actually occur over time and players will be forced to pay for that continued development if they want to play a finished product. This explains and justifies the lower initial price of the game.I cannot recommend the game in the state that it is in, but I suspect this will change in perhaps 6 months time.Specific gripes- Diplomacy system is excessively shallow. Think 1\3 of the depth of Civ5.- Domestic AI (sectors) are an attempt at reducing micro for large empires and simulating the challenges of a sprawling star empire. They end up being both annoying (unable to micro stuff that needs to be microed even when you want to) and downright infuriating (the ai makes suboptimal choices that limit growth).- Allied AIs simply blob up and follow your main fleet instead of doing any thinking at all.- Ship designs organization is rudimentary. Probably the most glaring issue. You cannot upgrade ships to different classes; you can only upgrade existing classes. This leads to hair pulling for players used to microing their builds ala Galactic Civilizations.- Game UI needs a lot of work.			"

Minimal diplomacy options, frustratingly RNG technology, unbalanced and overall lacking combat (corvette spam meta, anyone?), bugging ingame events and AI, total lack of any but agressive win conditions and you can't even get those in an alliance/federation, must end the game solo. The matches are typically long to the genre, but lack the necessary depth to keep them interesting through the hours. This game seemed like a decently interesting addition to the space 4X genre, but was a sore disappointment.			"

A couple differences from the main Civilization games that I particularly enjoy:1) Build your own Race / Civ complete with positive and negative attributes2) Real Time instead of turn based, never be the one holding a multiplayer game or the one frustrated at others for holding up a game.3) The game has a lot more depth than any Civ game I've played. Down to weapons load outs on ships, leaders for multiple research queues and ships, planet-side production and population maintenance, etc, etc4) The game takes place in space and involves a plethora of alien species to play as or against...

												I was pretty excited for Stellaris when it was first released. I like EU IV, but I prefer starting games like this as one territory / planet / city and building up from there. I thought Stellaris would be excellent if it could take the best of EU IV and allow me to do this. Instead I found the game mechanically uninteresting. With the recent update that came out with Utopia I thought I'd give it another try. The early game is OK, scouting for new planets to settle, building up the economy, etc. There is some balancing required of resources, which is good - keeping energy income in check with expansion, keeping influence income high enough to be able to hire leaders, issue an edict if need be, grab that new colony. For the most part developing the planets doesn't have difficult choices to make. It seems to work out fine to just put down the improvement that utilizes the resource on the tile. The one place a varied from this is the buildingd that generate unity. Due to energy or mineral constraints, it can be important to prioritize the order things are developed.Like many space 4X games, the military aspect isn't very engaging either. Try scout out what types of weapons and defenses a potential enemy has, design your ships and throw them at the enemy. I wish someone would figure out to make the combat interesting in this type of game. I've enjoyed space combat that is more tactical, like in Master of Orion 1 & 2, but I haven't seen a more hands off appraoch be implemented in an interesting way.Even diplomacy, the area the Paradox usually excels - feels watered down. For all the choices there weren't a lot that were that useful or interesting. I made some trade / research deals, but for the most part I was self sufficient. I do like the wargoals system that Paradox uses in their games. You can insult empires to♥♥♥♥♥♥them off. Try to keep people at peace. Diplomacy feels more fleshed out in a game like EU IV, and maybe one of the strongest features in that game, but in Stellaris it feels kinda watered down and not really as vital a system.I had the same feelings about Cities: Skylines. A good city builder for those with some imagination or creativity, but not a great game from a strategy game perspective. I think Stellaris may be enjoyable for those who can use there excitement to fill in some details to make their story more interesting, but for a player like me who just focuses and the mechanics and trying to succeed - it falls flat.

												Sooo...There's a LOT I love about this game. I want to give it a thumbs up. But too many serious issues means it gets a thumbs down. If they fix the major stuff, I'm willing to change.Some major issues:Very serious slowdowns mid to late game. Early game it may take you 1 hour real world to play 10 years of game time (I'm just making up times). Mid and late game  it may take you 5-10 hours to get through that same 10 years....or longer. It's pretty severe. To add insult to injury, this game does not have multi core support. In this day...why? I highly doubt this issue can be fixed due to it coming down to raw number calculations. Without muli-core support, there's really no place to go. Trying to optimize your code will only go so far. This engine came out in 2007 (I think?) so it's highly doubtful they can do much to improve performance.Diplomacy completely broken.Get used to games where no one will ever talk to you and everything you try to propose to other opponents will read -1000. In the end it will pretty much always be you, by yourself, against large federations.Combat system.MANY, many issues. Just one example....you can have a combat score at 100% and the game will not give you the win due to some other empire taking a planet during your conflict. This is just one example of MANY.Sector system.Yeah don't get me started here. I understand what they were going for here, and it failed. Fixing the AI to manage better will go a long way to making it tolerable.There's many other issues but these are some of the highlights.			"

												8/10Ah at last, a game that scratches the itch Galactic Civilizations II left in my little gamer heart. If you love micromanaging an empire, customize an entire alien race (in a more intuative and detailed way than GalCivII), and really feel like you're exploring a living Galaxy, this is the game for you.Pro's-Intuative controls (for me at least)-Multitude of options for governing your empire-No fleet-size cap. Only number of total ships are limited-Interesting races that you can discover/create. (I myself made the Chozo and am loving it)-You can easily keep track of everything in your empire (once you learn the layout)-Vast number of options for creating a race, including multiple (up to 8) different species within a phenotype. (Avain, fungus, ect)-Research 3 tech at once instead of a (very slow and useless) single tech research-Beautiful music and atmosphere (or lack of one)-Not possible to simply ""steamroll"" the Galaxy once the player desires (they still have to use their brain with the Warscore system)-Random events that feel real and keep the player's attentionCon's-Nonsensical solar system control limit +Can only control 5 systems +Must automize systems beyond that with ai controlled sectors +Ai controlled races still control every system despite your own cap. (In big empires at war this is a huge handicap for the player, beyond a fair fight for them)-Steep learning curve to capturing worlds (I'm peaceful till I get crowded)-Research options change in between selections. Unclear how they are unlocked +Almost feels like the lottery at some points +This part is unexplained and leaves the player confused-Unusual negotiations between racesGoing back to my 8/10 rating. This game is spectacular, fun, and engaging, but has some issues that do ruin the experience at times. (to the point that I had to get mods to rectify the situation, like the system control cap and the research lottery) Remember that this review was my own personal opinion, so some things that I like might make/break the game for others.

												Imagine Crusader Kings without the history rich factions and countries.  Imagine Master of Orion with a far less impressive race/government creator.  Imagine Galactic Civ 2 without ship customization.  If you can imagine all that in one game... you probably figured its a mediocre hybrid of all of them, not really standing out and shining in any way that would make me recomend this game.  I couldnt get into it, and Ive never had that problem with a space 4X game.  In short I saw it as a rather empty, basic space exploration, with the invotation being the same basic gameplay from Crusader Kings, but that game had much more in terms of politics, management, and like I said the history which rooted it, and made you care.  I didnt care about my little empire, my little solar system.			"

												I felt very misled by the first portion of Stellaris. It sets players up to think that it's going to be a great game, only to lead them to the sad reality that the game's functionally only in beta. Most of the content is only semi-functional. There are severe balancing issues. The AI isn't finished. The scripted stories don't all finish.  At this point it time, Stelaris is only a good buy for people who like to play early access games... which is to say, definitely only the most serious fans. Others will most likely burn out any fun they might have long before the game really hits its prime. Set it down, come back in 2017. It'll probably be better then.			"

												If you like strategy games of any sort, stop wondering if you will like this and just buy it.The biggest complaint anyone can leverage against it is that it's not complicated enough.While it does have things to micromanage in it, it does not reach a new high score for game systems that require micromanagement.  It's quite possible to play a whole game without ever pausing, and to some people that means there aren't enough things to do.			"

												Stellaris is besides Endless Space 2 one of the major X4 hypes 2016 for me. First of all the absolute fantastic selection for your own starting population paired with ethic and other choices is incredibly detailed. Your aim is to lead your empire from pre-ftl (mod) one-system empire into global galaxy leader...by force but at your choice also by diplomatics, economics or other fields. It is up to your very own idea and imagination how this should be done. Still impressed by the 'old' Clausewitz-Engine, well known from historic based Europa Universalis and other games from Paradox developer. Anyhow it's still 32bit (so far I know), you are able to play Stellaris with more then 1000 star systems and more then 32 competitors...even in multiplayer. As known from Paradox they constantly patch and upgrade game and content of their great games for free, while offering steady flow of DLC to enhance players experiance and certainly also to fund their efforts.While Stellaris is out I have seen 4 DLC plus free updates of this great game, anyhow I didn't buy one of those DLC so far as most of them are purely cosmetic so I wait for sale to get them. More impressed I am from full workshop support from day one, so players could alter their game experiance into anything they or the modders might think about. Back to first line, I want to state that Stellaris is more then a common 4X title for me personally, even when it is real-time while I prefer turn-bases instead. I'd say Stellaris should be named 4X-S, where 'S' is synonyme for simulation, as you form your own starting race and culture and simulate their way throughout the following centurys while you eXplore the universe, eXpand your empire till you reach hard-to-beat neighbours, eXploit your goods to finally eXterminate your competitors. Base game is great, comes for an absolute effordable price and offers hours of fun, no matter if you prefer single or multiplayer. If you see it on one of the several sales, go grab you a copy, you will be impressed if not overwhelmed by in-depth gameplay.			"

												[Placeholder 4 hours into my first match]Preordered Stellaris about a week before launch. So far, this game has lived up to the preorder, unlike so many other games which disappointed or flopped. My first game (vs. AI) so far:Bumbling around in my small galaxy, trying to learn the game. Run into another empire slightly bigger than mine, but thankfully they're peaceful, and after making an embassy with them we seem to get along. Finally realize after a few hours that to build different ship models, you have to design them yourself in the shipbuilder (using available upgrades you research in the tech tree)! No real issues, keep exploring the galaxy, trying to expand my empire to catch up to my ""friend"" so that my empire doesn't get squashed if they turn against me...A quarter of the galaxy away, come across a new solar system...Do a double take. It's Sol. Earth. Epic!Well done Paradox, well done.			"

												Good game which has that Civ V ""One more turn"" feel to it even though it is a hybrid RTS. There is a lot of ccontent, but still has room for improvement, especially in star systems. Currently there are only two starting systems and I have yet to find a system with more than one star. I love the ability to make your own custom alien race. It would also be nice it they could come up with races that weren't organic based like the void clouds and crystals. My only compaliants are the learning curve, and the fact Pluto isn't present in the Earth solar system. I know it's not a planet, but that seems heartless. I mean there are like 4 or 5 astroids and like 10 moons, but not Pluto? </3			"

Great gameWhile the game as it stands isn't perfect, there are many patches planned and updates already outlined for the future to address almost every single complaint I've seen on the game. Paradox Interactive are very good listeners and history shows how much they care for their products.Stellaris is a fantasic start: the base engine and system are very well thought out and dynamic. There are some issues, like with influence, but overall the game is very fun and has a ton of gameplay options. Very very replayable.All of my issues with Stellaris are minor and are to be addressed soon anyhow. Buy it.			"

												Got the game because you can not find many good 4x space games that are multiplayer.  There are a bunch out there but none that caught the attention of both me and my g/f.  So I got two copies and started a multiplayer match with my g/f and just for fun I went with the biggest map and most AI to see how the game handles, or how my computer would handle the game.  Got to say the game surprised me, not only did neither of our computers have any issues.  The AI kept up quite well with both of us working together.  Most 4x games I run into I tend to roflstomp the computers unless it's on some of the harder difficulties, and while it took me a moment to accustom myself to how this one works (which I also liked), it had challenge to it from the start and kept the game interesting.  I did not completely blow past the AI in tech, nor did the AI completely slaughter me in production (normally the case in most 4x games I play, at least initially).  It wasn't hard for my g/f to pick up and play either...she had to ask some questions here and there for how something worked but 95% of it she got on her own and was doing well.So overall I got to say I like the game and will keep playing it, and I am 90% certain she will too...

												I love Paradox's games, and this one is enjoyable and I have spent a lot of time with it.  That said as most of their offerings, it really does not shine as released.  The sector mechnic is a little futzy and while it is clear what they are trying to respresent (political fragmentaitonduring growth), and do (reduce micromanagment for the player), it really only succeeds on the later score and generally serves as a more annoying and frsutrating that interesting obstalce to the players.  The pacing of the game also seems a bit off, with many of the ""survey"" quests becoming impossible well before they are acheivable.There are the bones of an interesting take n this genre here, but as is it really could use some more polish.

												Plus side:This is the space game you’ve been waiting for for a decade. Rich, complex, surprising (solving the gretest 4X issue of all playthroughs being more or less identical), each playthrough is different. I expect the ""hours on record"" figure to gain a couple orders of magnitude in the coming months. After the bland reskins of the Master of Orion concept (GalCiv, Endless, Distant Worlds), this is finally a truly better game moving the genre forward and setting the new standard with a lot of novel mechanics and depth.Minus side:-Combat is simplistic and there is no skill involved. Nobody yet did better than Master of Orion 1 twenty years ago.-Diplomacy is currently completely broken. Like, you offer a civilization a promise you will not attack them, asking nothing in return (in a bid to boost relations), and they will write back that they refuse your ridiculous request.-Tutorials are broken. After meeting twenty civilizations, having embassies with three of them and trading with them routinely, you will get a ""First contact! This changes everything!"" message when meeting the twenty first. Broken condition chains happened so often I started completely ignoring the tutorial messages and mini-missions. I expect this to be patched out shortly.-I am not so sure there is sufficient depth to the various races to make them anything else than reskins with two or three personality variables. Yet to see anything that isn’t ""antropomorphic animal with a randomly generated flavoring"". To draw the inevitable comparison to MOO again, MOO’s few races suffer from the same furry-convention design uninspiredness, but are strongly defined personality archetypes - in Stellaris, all the dozens of avian/reptilian/fungoid empires blend together, and you don’t get the sense of ""hey, these guys are like this, and those guys are that"". The claim of many tens of races is therefore kind of devalued by their relative identity. Also making interesting extra races an optional purchase was kind of a♥♥♥♥♥♥move to begin with - it’s an essential feature if you want the game to be more replayable. If you’re gonna have thirty plus empires on the map, make sure they feel different.-Research doesn’t feel as profound/consequential/meaningful as in other 4X games. For whatever reason, I don’t get the sense of excitement and discovery that comes with climbing the tech tree in MOO or Civilization, much less Kerbal Space Program. The game doesn’t communicate the longer-term implication of various venues of research very well.Verdict: kiss your relatives goodbye and buy the game. You’ll get lost for days and weeks. Paradox pulled off something great, and I hope there will be expansions and DLCs.			"

												Hello Gentleman and Ladies just want to tell you of this game called Stellaris.   In my opinion this is easiest to learn and less obtuse of all Paradox games I have ever played.  I am referring to Europa Universalis and Crusader kings, which I still don't understand the whole mechanics of both them.  With Stellaris I jumped right in and with the Help of the in-game tutorial I was off to a running start exploring my Galaxy. The interface is really slick, polished and easy to learn compared to the previous games I mentioned from Paradox.  Events where not all coming at once and you can soak each one in and make decisions pretty easily without getting logged jam.  I might have not logged a ton of hours yet on the game but what I have accomplished in the game like design multiple different races and ships already for first hour of game speaks alot of the depth this games has.  I also started 3 single player games and even chatted on the multiplayer server which had people ready to jump into some multi player fun.Everything about this game yells quality.   The soundtrack, user interface and attention to details of the planets is astounding while zooming into them.  I don't play alot of 4x games because it gets kinda gets that same ole feeling after awhile, but this game is random and so deep in strategy I can't begin to tell you where to start on what they put in this game.  One example is how you choose your ruler.  I choose Democracy and they have election every 5 years.  I noticed one of the 3 nomiees was favored by the people, even without me endorsing the delegate {which you can at the cost of some influence points}.  I noticed he had a special ability called the peoples champion, just like the ROCK {you know Dwayne Johnson},  which I thought was nice touch.  Of course he won even without my endorsement.  As I saying this game is deep for my brief play thoughs so far.  You can go as deep in the Rabbit hole as you feel comfortable.  Heck you can stay on the main universe map and let the computer micro everything for you, but you would only be scratching the surface on what this game has to offer.  To be honest it wasn't that hard to learn either and I am kinda surprised for Paradox game.  Well this game is going to only get better as people start modding it and future DLC from Paradox {especially the diplomatic portion is there, but lacking alot of option we expect from a Paradox game}.  I am looking forward to the day someone Mods the Star Trek Universe!   Buy this game if you are s Science fiction fan or into any Grand Strategy games {even Civilization games}.  This game has it all.  Let your imaginiation go crazy.  This game has so much potential even though it already is a enormous game from the get go.  Just go buy it, you won't regret it, your going to have memoriable memories in this game.  Its that good.			"

												**UPDATE***So I decided to give the game 100 hours, since I love Paradox, and this game is still trash. I have a killer rig, yet the game gets really sluggish even on medium maps towards late game.  It isn't optimized at all.  I thought battle mechanics might need just more time on my end...nope...still trash.  Forget about trying to do a war if the enemies all get ""Psi Jump"" since you will never even have a chance to engage in a fight...even if you outnumber them 100 to 1.  This game is just horrible...even Endless Space seems like a AAA title compared to this failure from Paradox.  ---------Unfortunately I cannot say Stellaris is a good game to try...yet.  It has potential, but overall the game is severely (as in, beta type development) lacking in battle mechanics.  There is no strategy involved nor can you plan for eventual fighting.  There is no espionage, so there is no way of knowing how advanced your foes are, until it is beyond too late.  If you lose a war when you are not warleader, you lose completely with no chance of coming back.   You will see players on forums talking about interchanging weapon modules and tailoring ships to fight you foes...which sounds good (on a forum only) but never works out that way since, as mentioned, you cannot determine what your foes or even allies have going on.Don't even get started on allies.  Trying to track down their fleet movements is not only a chore, its a game of ""Where's Waldo"".  Paradox has enough experience to know what is an issue with battle mechanics (since that is one of the biggest gripes in every game), but there is absolutely no excuse for the junk they have presented this time.  Of course, we know that they plan to sell features later in DLCs, witholding features that actually would help.  This is a complete failure and dissapointment from my favorite dev studio.			"

 Stellaris review Stellaris is a great grand-strategy game with already good gameplay and even better potential for the future. If you like strategy games with a big scaled gameplay, Stellaris is definitely a game for you. You are able to spend hours within the game, building up your empire, constructing buildings on planets and fighting wars on a galactic scale. But the game also has its disadvantages. Some main critic points are:- hard to learn- game engine is not that well-engineered, it starts to produce lag later in the game- the AI (enemy, ally and your own sector managing) sometimes does bad decision or is not able to fullfill its role- diplomacy is not that good in combination with the AI- mainly designed for singeplayerBut even with its disadvantages I can still recommend Stellaris and when it hopefully gets patched, it will be even better.7.5/10			"

												Got this game because friend has told me its ck2 in space, never played ck2 but heard many fantastic stories and opinions about that game.Well and its definitely not ck2 in space. Its just a base framework for future addons/dlc's. A bit shallow game.Early game is really nice  with exploration and early colonization and management, mid game where alliances/federation happens and colony micromanaging and later game which is boring as heck. This game severly lacks proper mid/late game content and ""crisis"" is not proper end-game content. Kinda expected too see my neighbour to ally with me to fight againt extraterrestrial alien swarm but nop. He was still angry at me. It would be nice if we could cease fire for the sake of saving the galaxy. While other empire are collapsing to them.Every AI behaved the same and any pacicift AI was hating me too becasue I was warmongering with my neighbour too much. Diplomacy is unpolished and shallow. Beyond agreements there is nothing else to do, why I can't marry some pretty alien girl or set a no-man-land by comprosis if war takes too long.Combat system  *visuals* are terrible and in the late game you just stack those fleets and let the disco lights happen. There is no real tactical depth into it.Also AI allies/vassals tend to follow your main fleet everywhere. AI is not really fleshed out and it was the easiest/cheapest way to make them usefull in the war. Instead of taking a time and planning your tactics with various generals from alliances on the galaxy-map,setting up objectives and everyone would know what to do, you have this. Think how fantastic it would be. But nah not even Military Junta government have anything similar to this, yeah goverments are just bunch of raw stat boosts and AI behaviour alterations.All alien races feel way too *humanoid* to mee, this game could use more varied gameplay styles like devouring worlds instead of colonizing planets. Also where are robot races? Cyborg races? Its all the same gameplay, only some AIs will colonize more , some less planets.I won't mention how the game punishes you for having a big population and influence really limits your gameplay. Or several annoyanced like sectors or not-so-good AI. This game also runs on 1 cpu , come one its 2016, you can dream about generating 10k galaxies with 500 AIs in the future with mods. Game also has some solid problem in the late game with the performance. And how warscore is not so good idea, what if I just want to glass every planet? What If i don't really care about warscores and I want to quickly conquer their empire? I don't really think every race would behave the same, always respecting *some-kind-of-universal-galaxy-law-about-the-warscore*. Klingonds didn't, they fought for the sake of combat and honours and some should fight for the same of domination, afraidness, using the weak-sides.Right now it looks like this, you conquer 3 planets, 10year peace-period and repeat. Its called a artifical time extender, same goes for surveying systems with your science ship and clicking on every debris manually by shift-click. I can understand in the early-mid but in the late there could be some kind of automatization, there are bigger concerns than clicking on small X all around the galaxy. Less micromanaging in late-game please. no trade routes ( it would be nice to see small cargo-ships travelling between your systems, it would add a lot the the gameplay mechanics like ""cut the supply lines"" ) ^ also no pirates? really? they only happen in 1 event and disappear forever no espionage no sabotages no family tree? really? no marriages no sabotagesGood game , had fun but it just feels unfinished. I really dig the random-event and reading lore but there needs to be more of it, especially in the mid/late game.  Its just average game at this moment.  Kinda gets boring after a while.Maybe after year or two with some decent dlc/updates, this game will get better, well for sure it will get.			"

												So 22~ hours in already, after only 2 days of playing. The easiest and shortest way to describe this is a ""Europa Universalis in Space"" type of game. And Im loving it!There are features and mechanics that sometimes feel a bit shallow (Alliance/Federation Tools/Options), which is where I hope Paradox can deliver some amazing expansions as they usually do with their other Grand Strategy titles, to expand and give more depth and complexity, but also more control to the players.Then there are other features such as the ship design, where you have so much control and complexity that you can spend hours just designing your space ships to be the perfect tool for an upcoming war.I got 22 hours in so far, which I have accumulated over 2-3 days of playing. (One which was 11 hours straight!) And it feels like Im still scratching the surface, yet I have had so much fun with it.I highly recommend Stellaris, if you know you enjoy Grand Strategy games such as Europa Universalis, which now takes its place in space.Also worth mentioning is the fact its highly modable! Meaning there are already plenty of Mods in the works by the community. The talk about total conversion mods in the themes of Star Wars and Mass Effect has me so exited I dont know what to do.PS: This is the type of game, that if you get into it, it will be as if you stepped into a time machine, cause you wont know where time has gone when you then look at the clock!

												Stayed up until 1.30am to install. Was playing 20 minutes later.I got lost in the game, it was everything I wanted to be - the music, the species, the exploration, the rise of the evil space bugs of Krythx...BEEP BEEP BEEP My alarm for 7am goes off. I go to work exhausted and disorientated, still thinking about my mighty space bugs and their struggle to enslave the galaxy. It was a long day, but eventually made it back. I'll go to bed at a reasonable time tonight, but not before I get in some space-conquering first.VERDICT9/10 would neglect sleep again.			"

												When I discovered this game I thought to myself, sure it's just another 4x game that I'll play for a bit. I was wrong,but in a good way,stellaris is a dream come true for me. from its immense detail,stunning visuals to the great sound track,  it truly immerses you in a galaxy that is your own,  a race that you've created, guided with leaders that you gotten to know and explore new lands with, stellaris is unlike other 4x games,  exploration isint just about scanning planets for resources but includes a very star trek like anomaly system that adds an rpg element to the game. Once you explore it's time to expand and upgrade,  the detailed research system and planet development system offers you complete freedom in how your empire is run. The best thing perhaps about this game is the detail of the empire builder, it is unlike anything I've experienced in any other game and it has kept me making more and more and more races to see how different traits mix with different government or ethic types and it allows me to really create races with my own lore and backstory,  long live the Kalderin sovereignty, and it's eternal king. Overall this game is amazing and I recommend it to anyone who likes strategy,  rts and 4x games or even if you just like scify.			"

												I played many of the Civilization games as well as some more space themed 4X games like Sins of a Solar Empire and when I went into Stellaris I thought it would be the same.I was wrong - very wrong.I found it hard to keep playing the other 4X games. I personally thought they were very complicated and had a tough time with them. Stellaris is not like that. The gameplay is smoother and it's so much easier to pick up the complexities. I'm definitely loving this game and all it has to offer. From making my own fully customized species, naming every single leader and constantly choosing how to upgrade all of my ships I found this game perfect.I recommend it to all of the people who enjoy 4X games - but still find them lacking. 10/10 from me. Hope you enjoy as much as I did.			"

												Bought this for my Dad because it reminded me of some board games he enjoys. I've played Crusader Kings 2 and Victoria II so I'm familiar with Paradox Studios. I have to say this game is pretty addictive, I've been playing my Dad's copy through Steam sharing, and both he and I have racked up over a 100 hours of play each. I'm planning to get my own copy so we can play the multiplayer and I can recommend it to anyone who enjoy strategy games and/or science fiction.			"

A solid space sci-fi 4X strategy by Paradox, complete with their grand strategy flourish, and Paradox's most approachable grand strategy yet.+ Consistent visual direction coupled with more-than-serviceable graphical fidelity. One can quite literally zoom into a space battle and watch each ship shoot, maneuver, and more vs the enemy.+ Great musical soundtrack that backs up the game in all the right places+ Supremely crafted game mechanics and systems that interact and synergize together to create a game that is deep at all levels of play, from micro-managing colonies or ship/station designs to fleet composition, to macro-managing entire sectors of space, the interplay of interstellar politics and diplomacy between races, and more.+ Solid introductory tutorial built into the game as you play, that can be set to give you tutorial goals to aim for, give advice and tips only, or be deactivated wholesale.+ Paradox's consistent and solid support for their games and for the modding scene, complete with mod kit support. Expect regular (if somewhat sprinkled with long waits) game updates that could alleviate, or outright fix, noted issues below.======-Inconsistency in UI usage flow and seemingly missing features that feel like they should be standard. For example, no auto-explore for science ships. No rally points for ship building. Constuction complete alert doesnt show what exactly is built, just where it is on. Extra clicks to get where you need. Planet list tab also list sectors with their own planets when it really should be broken up into sectors having their own tab, etc.Several solved with 1.3 Heinlein update-Sectors feature (where it is meant to alleviate the need to micromanage more than your core planet limit) seems to act very inconsistently even with recent updates. There is also no option to terraform planets other than removing existing stations above a planet and manually placing a terraforming station before the AI of the Sector replaces the now-removed station.Some work to alleviate this in 1.3 Heinlein update- Base default number of AI on default settings (17) can be a LOT of factions to keep an eye on in the mid- and end-game politics, and can be a big ask on those unfamiliar with Paradox's level of grand strategy between poltical factions. Recommended to start small to get used to the game's core 4x mechanics, then the diplomacy, then moving up.			"

Posted: May 15, 2016
												So I'm gonna preface this by saying that I am a massive fan of paradox strategy games and I have many many hours into Crusader Kings and Europa UniversalisWhat is Stellaris?Stellaris is 4x space exploration game In which you command a species that has just managed to create some form of faster than light technology and is ready to explore and colonise the stars, as you expand you will find other similar space faring empires with whom you can form alliances with or wage war. You can also research technologies in a quasi-random manner (explained later) and design your own vessels from scratch in the ship designer.I want to start this review off by stating clearly that Stellaris feels unfinished and needs polish. There is room for improvement everywhere from the combat, diplomacy, to the management of your empire. I have over the course of my playthroughs noticed fairly commonly assets appearing where they shouldn't such as the center of the galaxy being a missle, some assets not dissapearing such as the visual effects from the ships FTL drives which at one point lead to me to believe during a war that my opponents fleet was in a entirely different place than where it actually was. Speaking of war, AI is a bit strange during war, allies tend to rush to you and stick to your fleets instead of doing independent activities which is annoying because It means you'll probably have to guide their navies around or they'll end up losing. During lategame crisies such as Invaders from a different dimension the AI doesnt really care to send their fleets to attack their home system, meaning that if you are playing singleplayer you'll probably have to fight them all off yourself and the sectors that you can use to automate parts of your empire really need more options.Now that I've explained that to you lets begin.The planet management I'll go over firstly, planets are based on tiles and citizens work these tiles, some tiles may have a bonus to a certain type of resource like maybe one tile gives +1 Food even though nothing is built upon it, It's very Civilisation like in this manner, requiring a surplus of food to get new citizens and then being able to build farms, mines, research labs, military acadamies ect ect, the number of these tiles depends of the planets size, the size meaning how many there are. There Is nothing particularry wrong with it but there is one minor gripe that I have and that is that planets don't differ in how much minerals they have or how fertile they are. A barren planet is just as good at producing food as a tropical one is which is a bit strange, I first thought that the ""habitability"" of a planet was how fertile it was but actually it's just what the maximum happiness is but aside from that minor gripe I have, I actually had a bit of fun min-maxing planets to do certain goals like minerals or research.Species and empire creation is suprisingly indepth allowing you to create a species and an empire from scratch. You create a species select their appearence from a wide variety of options and give them traits for example one of my games I was playing as a Avian race that was industrious and dilligent at work but were weak at ground combat, then you create their government. You can select their ethics which is basicly what their society believes in. As in, are you millitaristic or pacifists, Spiritualistic or Materialist ect ect. Normally most of the time Empires have 2 ethics one of which is a extreme version of one (EG: Fanatic Pacifist and Individualist but you can have 3 at maximum (Pacifist, Materialistic and Induvidualist to give an example) these change the options during events and give bonuses. Once you have selected your ethics you then select a government type that Is based upon those ethics, So If I picked militaristic I can be a Dictatorship, or  Moral Democracy If I picked Pacifist. There are quite a large number of different government types and I was really surpised by just how many options there were, I mean you even get to choose what the cities look like which are only ever seen when you are looking at the planet overview menu.There is no real goal that the game sets for you to accomplish which is similar to other Paradox titles, instead you set your own goals and try and accomplish them, I personally enjoy to role-play who I am playing as. Which Stellaris lets you do very nicely thanks to it's ethics system, I think the way that ethics work is great for people who like to role-play and I enjoyed playing as a Fanatic Collectivist and Xenophobic hivemind hell bent on the continued existance of my species and mine alone regardless of the cost.. The ethics sytem isnt just good for roleplaying though, as AI empires are randomized It meant that every time I played I never found the same nation or species twice. One game my neighbors were federation builders who wanted to create an alliance with me, the next I was surronded by millitaristic expansionist empires and constantly fought wars and had to prioritize millitary research tech as I tried to survive. I never felt bored when I was starting a new game and I was never in the same situation twice which I absolutely love as it make the game very replayable, although It is worth stating that if you are not role-playing you may end up feeling restricted by the ethics system as It means at certain times you can't do certain things and It may even be a detriment at times.Now research is a bit weird. I mentioned earlier that you can research technologies in a ""quasi-random manner"" and I'm gonna simplify it a tiny bit If you want a indepth explanation then check the Stellaris wiki page. Now. In Stellaris you have 3 areas of technology, Physics, Society and Engineering, now Stellaris doesn't really have a tech tree instead once you have researched a technology 3 new ones appear at random for you to select, at the start of the game some techs are coded to always appear for example the tech that allows you to build colony ships will always appear at the start but past that it is all random but some techs are weighted to appear more than others. Now personally I'm a bit 50-50 on this system because while it does mean that there is alot of varience in terms of what different empires are good or bad at, It meant that quite a few times RNG utterly screwed me and I didnt get any of the techs to build bigger ships which eventually lead to a war and then I entered a death spiral which eventually left me defeated. However you can reduce this RNG through reverse engineering, after a battle, destroyed ships turn into debris and researching it does two things, firstly is adds a percentage of research progress to whatever technology the ship had on it like better missles or shields and secondly makes those techs always avaliable to research, untill they are researched which is a good way of balancing out the RNG aspect.The ship designer is pretty good, you create a ship based on modules called sectors these sectors have inside them differing numbers of slots of differing sizes and It also varies the look of the ships depending on what sectors you have selected for them which Is a nice touch. In general you can add stuff to you ship such as shields, armour, weapons and power supplies. There is only one main issue with the ship designer and that Is that the auto-generated ships tend to be rubbish so It's probably for the best that you design the ships yourself.Apparently I've hit the character limit so here is very brief conclusion.Steam needs neutral reviews. I personally utterly adore Stellaris as It scratches an itch that I've had for a while but at the moment it needs polish and a lot of it. If you want to buy It but are even the slighest bit unsure then wait for the patches and DLC to come in a few months and then determine if it's worth it.			"

												To put it simply, Stellaris is like Crusader Kings 2 in space with the military system from Europa Universalis 4. It strives to get you immersed into the game, and then drops off into redundant events and situations over and over until you finally go out and conquer the galaxy. It'll be like this until you finally lose it over some bug screwing with your fleets and such. Look, I'll be honest with you. The game desperately needs more content. On the same note, it desperately needs some patches to fix some irritating bugs (such as a science ship constantly moving back and forth from north of the planet to south of the planet instead of researching a project like I ordered it to). The end game crisis events are VERY UNDERWHELMING. Do you know how many times I saw ships from the Machine Consciousness? Once, and that was when they first showed up! Currently, the AI (the actual AI, not the robots and Machine Consciousness) is terrible. They seem to love to suicide charge back into their system with their entire fleet if you so much as send a single Corvette into their territory. This leads to an extremely easy way to draw an enemy fleet away from your capital (capitals are one of the only things they seem to go after). Sad thing is, this is only one example. In order for you to truly understand, you need to see it for yourself. The game desperately needs mods if you plan on not being bored after the first stretch of hype and excitement. At the very least, I recommend getting the mod that adds more events, the mod that allows all three late game crisis events to trigger (not all at once, of course), and the mod that allows you to remove foreign stations from your territory. The stations mod is crucial if you are to remove all those irritating wormhole stations of your rivals that can't normally be removed without being at war with them. Save yourself some trouble and GET MODS. What is my final conclusion on Stellaris? Understand what you're buying. Currently, you're getting a game that really lacks replay value. It is possible to get your money's worth its current state, but without mods, you're going to have a lot less replay value. It's interesting with friends, but can begin to feel the same each time nonetheless. Overall, it isn't a bad game. It just needs time to mature.I give it something between a 6/10 and a 7/10, which means it barely makes recommended status. I'm writing this on June 20, 2016 with no DLC available in case someone reads this in the future.Edit: I forgot to mention how bad it lags in fleet battles. If you have two fleets of decent size fighting in a galaxy you're viewing, the game just begins lagging like crazy. For your own good, just check in on the fight here and there. Don't zoom in on it and try to watch the entire time unless you're okay with waiting a while.			"

It just needs time to mature.I give it something between a 6/10 and a 7/10, which means it barely makes recommended status. I'm writing this on June 20, 2016 with no DLC available in case someone reads this in the future.Edit: I forgot to mention how bad it lags in fleet battles. If you have two fleets of decent size fighting in a galaxy you're viewing, the game just begins lagging like crazy. For your own good, just check in on the fight here and there. Don't zoom in on it and try to watch the entire time unless you're okay with waiting a while.			"

												Bought this for my Dad because it reminded me of some board games he enjoys. I've played Crusader Kings 2 and Victoria II so I'm familiar with Paradox Studios. I have to say this game is pretty addictive, I've been playing my Dad's copy through Steam sharing, and both he and I have racked up over a 100 hours of play each. I'm planning to get my own copy so we can play the multiplayer and I can recommend it to anyone who enjoy strategy games and/or science fiction.			"

												One of the most engaging sci-fi empire building games ever produced. A delightful blend of exploration of the unknown, mastering your domain, and then some real otherworldly strangeness, combine to make this a great narrative experience.  Pros: Accurate protrayal of collectivists.Cons: I only wish the strangeness would last forever. Its wonderfully engaging.			"

												I'm giving Stellaris a thumbs up. I have not been a big player of the 4X genre in fact this is the first 4X game that I have really enjoyed. The complexity of these types of games often is the reason I stop playing however the Stellaris tutorial is fantastic and really helps you to understand the game.While Stellaris feels in no way complete or perfect I feel like the aspects of the game it currently has work really well and are enjoyable. Late game can get a bit boring however the early game is a lot of fun, it's really hard to stop playing at times.The mods in the workshop only make this game better.Overall I'll give Stellaris a 7/10. 7.5 if you replace the original music with the Mass effect music mod! :)			"

												This game is great but is also very flawed. The build up and empire management is enjoyable, my favorite part is serving people in my empire's needs, expanding my galactice empire with colonization, dealing with galactic doomsday events, and also waring for more territory with other empires. Its biggest flaws are in diplomacy, combat, and victory types. Diplomacy is basic and boring, if you've played Civ 5 its about as complex as that except even more limited. You can't see what people can afford from you so you never know why a person is declining a deal unless of course they dislike you. Forming a Federation seems interesting except its basically just an alliance with more restrictions and a shared star fleet. With an alliance you can entice your allies to join a war with planets and stuff. But in a federation you have to be president to declare war and if you aren't then you just sit there twiddling your thumbs. Thats another thing: Mid to late game is exceedingly boring unless you're at war. Because of the limited diplomacy system politics with other empires is boring and the only ways to win are by controlling all the habitable planets or being the dominant empire(you may be able to do this if your alliance/federation does these things but I wouldn't know because getting to that point seems useless and a waste of time). Being pacifist doesn't really get you anything other than the chance for other empires to like you more, but that doesn't really matter when other empires will declare war on you about as often as a cat playing the piano. Ending wars can also be annoying because you can't ask for more even if you have a massive advantage, its either the war goals you set at the begining or only some of them depending on how well you do in the war.Now I've vented about a lot of the problems this game has but here's the good stuff: This game has massive replayablity. Everytime you want to start a new game you can either use the permade empires that come with the game(which are fun parodies of popular sci-fi empires) or create your own species. This species empire gets you ethics, traits(like advantages and disadvantages), ship designs, color schemes, and more. These thing will actually effect the way you play. If you're a pacifist for example and you discover primitives(pre-intersellar travel tech people) you can observe them but your ethic says you cannot interfere with them. Alternatively with other ethics you can just straight up invade and subjugate their people, aggressively observe them(ufo abduction type stuff, this has its own effects on the people) or you can infiltrate their governments and take them over from the inside. This makes for really entertaining gameplay as you do other things.Empire managment is actually enjoyable. You can either give all your planets a good balance of all resources or you can min/max more than a WoW veteran. And in order to make your galactic empire more manageable you can either create districts, which are semi-autonomous regions in your empire, or vassals. These are fully autonomous smaller empires that you can either create by conquering another empire or make using your own territory. They don't give you any resources from what I can tell though so its hard to say how useful one is vs. a district. Factions of dissatisfided citizens can also spring up and if left unchecked they can revolt and try to form their own territory and empire. In my current game I have a lot of factions from constant conquering of other people so my planets are filled with xenomorphs to put down revolts. And yes, I said xenomorphs. You can create different types of armies with different advantages which you'll need when you invade enemy planets.Fleet combat is simple enough to immidately understand but can be complex enough if you really want to do well. Generally, bigger numbers=win but obviously at a cost with both fleets sloging each other. A smarter stragetist will lure other smaller fleets and make it impossible for them to escape, this is very effective later game.Galactic doomsday events are also fun. In mid to late game you or one of the other empires will play with fire and get burnt. It's up to you can the rest of the galaxy to put it out before it gets out of hand and destroys everyone, its a very Independance Day all-countries-getting-together-to-fight-alien-menace type situation and its very enjoyable. I don't want to spoil what can happen so I won't say what they are.Overall: Good game, needs more			"

												All seemed well, my collectivist, slave making, genocidal master race was doing awesome. I purged many of the peasant alien races one by one, and anyone else who dared to speak against me, even my fleet admirals and scientists (ok they don't actually do that ingame but I take my roleplaying srsly gais). The majority of the galaxy was mine, only two factions left. There was the empire west of the galactic center, they lost many colonies, but they hadn't lost their will to resist. There was also another empire to the east of the galactic center, secluded by a Nebula. Because I am pretty much a God, I attack both at the same time. The battle against the western empire resulted in a loss, their coordinated point defence systems had my missles on lockdown, something which I did not anticipate. My laser equipped ships did enough damage to halt any sort of immediate follow up strike, but the remainder of my fleet required extensive repairs after initiating an emergency tacticool runawaywarp. The war in the east was even worse. The Nebula cloud slowed down my FTL warp travel, and because I decided to split the fleet into many fleetlings and attack from all sides, the jumps were very poorly coordinated. One fleetling jumped in after another had been completely obliterated by their defence platforms and ships. It was painful to watch, but then it hit me. Watching my severly underpowered 2K fleetings get their FTL drives stuck up their crewmen excrement ejector by 15K+ fleets reminded me of my galactic genocidal conquest. I bought this game to play, but I ended up feeling instead when I realised that I had pretty much been roleplaying Stalin's third reich of the rising sun. Tears streaked down my eyes as I watched my empire slowly break apart. This is what it felt like to have things taken away from you, to have your people enslaved by other people. One by one colonies fell, people rebelled and my leaders at the ripe young age of 200 years old began dying. I just sat there, staring at my home planet. Earth was beautiful, her deep blue oceans and earthy earth was the envy of the galaxy. My will to fight had been reignited.I rapidly built many defence platforms around the Sol system, made new battleships specifically designed to defend the OG waifu, Earth, and hired new fleet admirals. Then... I waited. (This is the part where they stopped trying to kill me out of empathy but I made them want to kill me again because it would be a cooler story). Sure enough, they came. Missles flew, cannons spewed, lasers pierced the darkness, and joint fighters filled the spaces inbetween as the defence of Sol became a reality. Wave after wave of ships forced me into learning how to micro-manage seperate ships to coordinate repairs, upgrades and tacticool decisions in order to fight at full efficiency. The waves would not stop, the fighting continued for several years, until finally they destroyed one of the defence platforms and punctured a hole in my inpenetrable wall. It set off a chain reaction, my wall began to crumble, until there was only the Earth ground defence army left. Huge fleets moved in and bombarded Earth with no remorse. Invasion fleets creeped in after the big bois and landed on her soil. With our fortifications destroyed and moral at an all time low, she fell in a matter of weeks. I had lost not only the game, but my heart as well. At that point I decided to go to bed. It was 5AM, and I cried myself to sleep, not because I had an important ethics test which I didn't study for the next day, but because of this game. :'(/10, never roleplaying again.			"

												As of typing this, I have logged a total of 26 hours of gameplay on Stellaris.I first saw Stellaris on Steam some week ago and was quick to add it to my wishlist due to the single fact that I hoped it would be the 4x RTS space game that I have been waiting for. I only bought the game a few days ago because I started watching some game plays on Youtube. I have to say, this game is everything I was looking for and more. I wanted a game where I could start a space empire and rule the galaxy, and Stellaris is that and everything more. From an enormous 300+ technology hodgepodge (not a tech tree) that you can study throughout your session, to an in depth ship designing page, to an intense foriegn diplomacy tango.The other night as I was playing, I was being beaten down by a powerful opponent who had a much larger navy than I. It was only when my allies came together and helped me defeat them was I savved. The whole experience was very ""anime style fights where the bad guy is beaten by the power of friendship.""The only factor that I really did not like from this game, was the fact that I ended up staying awake 'till 2am two nights in a row. I had to force myself to stop playing. Once you start playing Stellaris you can not stop. I am just glad I did not have work the next day.Highly recommend this game to anyone who is into Civ V, the Total War series, FTL, even Warhammer 40k. It's a whole lot of fun.			"

												This is a great game.  It takes the 4X genera to the next level.  What MOO did to create it, MOO2 did to advance it, and MOO3 did to kill it (and, despite a few solid attempts between then and now, such as GalCiv, StarDrive, Distant Worlds, Space Empires and Endless Space, to name just a few), this game actually revives the entire type of game and turns it from a who can grow the fastest and out-build everybody else into an actual strategy game.  Take it with a grain of salt, though.  The game is new, there are some bugs (some still game breaking) and there is a lot of room for improvement.  But, Paradox being Paradox, that is coming, and coming SOON.  Yes, the first two big patches already have a dev diary up, and should be available shortly.  DLC will happen, and it will cost a few bucks, but that also keeps the devs working on the game.  I am not going to go into a million details of what is great (or about the current batch of bugs that shipped with release, which is what most of the reviews I am reading are about – as those will soon be fixed), take a look out there, watch a few youtube videos if this game is of interest, and if $$ is an issue, wait for a sale.  I pre-purchased and I will say that I am definitely not disappointed, and I now have a much higher standard that I would expect all future 4x games to live up to.   "

												While  many aspects of this game such as the ship designing, exploring, varied races, and colony building are highly enjoyable, there are deal breaking flaws.  Fleet combat is not keyboard smashing frustration, but fleet engaging is just pathetic.  I have tried to defend my systems with fleets, stations, even multiple stacked Fortresss on Hyperlane only games just to try to find any way to stop or even slow down an incoming fleet.  All useless.  I have seen other reviews liken it to a game of ""whackamole"", and I find the description spot on.  Invading fleets blow by any and all obstacles (untouched) and then rampage through your vulnerable inner worlds, while you try to send your fleets after them and catch them.  Which often requires you to have several fleets of equal size to their one.  Then they just exit out, once again ignoring your very expensive fortresses at the hyperlane gates and just leave.  But don't you dare try the same to them, your ships have a hyperdrive cooldown time, and will be wiped out before they can retreat.  Until this is fixed, this game is useless.			"

Posted: July 28, 2016
												My overall rating for Stellaris: 90/100Paradox Development Studio and Paradox Entertainment shine in the genre of grand-strategy games. Their last step lead into space and amazing galaxy conquest. Stellaris is not the first or most complicated game among others grand stategies and 4X space-set games, but surely, it is the finest. Lets see in detail, what were positives and negatives of this title.GAMEPLAY+ Transparent and smooth design+ Challenges and changing nature of playthrough+ Simple combats+ Great impact of strategy+ Each choice has pros and cons+ End-game crisis element- Confusing tutorial- Late game might get repetetive and boringGameplay might be a bit confusing from the beginning (I spent six hours with creation of my empire :-D), but after a while, it is easy to get used to it. The course of the game is changing and bringing new challenges and goals to fulfill, what is good and I somehow miss it in other similar titles.Combat is simply looking, basically it is a simulator of numbers with graphical addition as you see ships cruising and firing, what gives the player impression of direct control. Yet you can intervene with strategical moves, e. g. one fleet serves as a bait and second flanks the enemy resulting into total destruction of enemy fleets, even with own fleets outnumbered.There are no only positive or negative decisions. You can gain greater control over your subjects, but they will protest, that they have no voting rights. In case of allowing them, they might be more satisfied, but a totally disastrous candidate might get elected during elections. Military contra economy, trust against power and so on.Mid and late game can get repetetive and boring and as a countermeasure, we have here an end-game crisis. It is a unique challenge, that is a little bit overpowered in design to change the course in the galaxy and it can end game efficiently, if left uncontested. Designs of extradimensional invaders (The Unbidden), Prethoryn Plague (hive, swarm civilisation) or AI uprising are perfectly done, even hive civilisation is made so perfectly, that many scifi novels should take a lecture from the developers.Here we are getting also to negatives. The timing of the end-game crisis might not be always fair, they might spawn too early, what may be frustrating for players, or too late, when the empires are so strong, that the crisis is beaten very swiftly.Also tutorial is a very confusing, I suggest turning it off and view instructions from YouTubers, which are far easier to understand.Also the management of planets in late game should get some improvements, it is horrible to watch over two hundred planets and seek the one, which you forgot to develop. Not to mention, that after the crisis, you just conquer, negotiate and rule.CHARACTERS+ Variety of state parameters+ Wide doplomacy possibilities+ Moding possibilities- AI behaviour might be illogical and not corresponding the situationThe creation of own state is something amazing, with wide racial, state, government factors and much more, you are guaranteed, that each playthrough will be unique. Also, as you cannot explore everything in one game (e. g. materialists have almost a zero chance, that they will get psionics), it motivates to replay the game with different setup.Also diplomay is great, after the last patch (1.2), you can conquer, liberate, or just humiliate another empire, form alliancies, threaten, insult, the possibilities here are borderless.I also admit, that Paradox let their players to modify the game and add own content, which may make the game even more challenging. This is a great step towards the community, what brings more joy to this great game.AI behaviour, although, has to be critized here, because sometimes it behaves irrationally. Empire threatened with and end-game crisis is ignoring it completely, though after the 1.2 update, things got a bit better. But, if the crisis spawns in the opposite corner of the galaxy, you might get there too late to win the fight. Also, I understand, that it is more difficult to implement new technologies to big empire than to small country. But small country cannot keep the pace of research capabilities of a huge empire!VISUALS+ Nicely stylised graphics+ Reasonable hardware/software demands- Few glitchesVisuals are stylised and it gives an impression of controlling something, that contains several worlds, solar systems or a part of the galaxy. Also modification of this races, genetic intervention, everything is detailed, even the ships and stations.Addition to this point is, that Stellaris has relatively fair demands on hardware and software, so also players with integrated graphic card may play it with only slight difficulties. Only few glitches were encountered, they did not affected the gameplay, so I did not count them into evaluation.SOUNDTRACK+ Atmospherical+ Corresponding to the game and its situationsComposed by Andreas Waldetoft and recorded by Brandenburg State Orchestra is well performed and suits the atmosphere and situations during the game. Transitions are not being felt, music plays smoothly and accordingly. Great addition to this impressions are Mia Stegmar's vocals.MULTIPLAYER+ Well balanced (after 1.2 Patch)- Only one goal (domination)Multiplayer was the weakest part of the game and many players end up complaining against corvette-spam. Things got better after the last patch (1.2), so players are forced to find various tactics, because it is easy to build corvettes, but also with proper ships easy to destroy.However, there is still only domination victory possible, with diplomatic possibilities players may decide, whether they will dominate the galaxy together or end up in a desperate fight with only one winner.SUMMARYTo sum it up, if the grand-strategy games would be stones, differing from silica to emerald or ruby, Stellaris is definitely a sapphire. It can give much also to players outside the genre and if somebody is considering starting playing this kind of games, Stellaris is a great start.Changing gameplay, new goals and opponents, various strategies, all of this outweights the few negatives, that the game has. With my evaluation I remained at the sapphire metaphore (90/100) and Stellaris can calmly claim to be one of best titles in this genre.			"

												First off, alittle about me is I love RTS games in general. Been playing them since I was about 6 years of age or less and they still have countless hours of my life dedicated to them. The company behind Stellaris has already a fantastic lineup of amazing games they have released over the years which are full proof amazing RTS's you cannot go without. That being said, Stellaris is no exception. Most of the reviews on here seem bland as they talk about the lack of updates or things to do mid game, but with how many options there are in the game already people need to use their minds and just create their own events. Maybe enlighten a hostile proto race, get two people to go to war, create new races and different socioeconomic sectors etc etc. Just because the game doesn't have literal events later on does not mean it's not worth it. Name one RTS that literally has events the entire time that are unique and randomly generated that aren't super short games. They even pledged to keep releasing updates to it over time for free instead of making people purchase for DLC and other stupid things that I think people are just too relaxed with. They are a godsend and this game has already taken a huge part of my day away from me each day and I don't regret it. Specifically I like how this game is not just a Overcome and swallow game but more of a diplomacy and exploration/Overcome/Swallow game. It's all how someone plays it. Have not found too many scifi RTS games that focus on the bigger picture rather than just the combat aspect of space empires etc etc.			"

To me, it's this perfect blend of Strategy, Simulation. and Roleplaying: a combination of all my favourite genres.Sure, it's still very rough around the edges, but the core experience of the game amazed me so much I didn't really care. Paradox is still releasing regular content patches to make up for this, so things can only get better. For example, the most recent patch at this time (Clarke) did a huge number of improvements to the AI and warfare.			"

												TL;DR Very fun at the start, but gets tiresome as the game goes on, and falls short in the late game.Stellaris is an exciting new release from Paradox. It offers new aspects of strategy games including civilization ethics, unique species, traits, and preferences. Along with it is a very interesting technology tree, as well as currencies that you must balance to get the most out of (and strategic resources that add flavour to the game). The game requires patience, strategy and planning, as well as micro-management.The game is exciting from the beginning. You are launched into a galaxy which you have no knowledge of. Your quest for the aquisition of resources is presented along with the opportunity to explore new star systems, and perhaps discover that you are not alone in the universe as it once seemed. The more you explore, the larger the galaxy begins to appear, and new opportunities arise.However, after putting in enough time and effort, the game begins to become a grind. You have achieved your goals of creating a utopia for your people, or becoming a force within the galaxy to be reckoned with.. But you have not completed the game yet and you're looking for a way to find closure. So you check your victory conditions and see that you have no choice but to control 40% of the galaxy (A normal galaxy is 600 stars, which each have their own number of planets) or eliminate every other nation, and you realise.. Whew, this is going to take longer than you thought. Hours, days, maybe weeks real-time.Unless you're really determined to see a victory screen, which itself is not really a reward (No achievement, or bonus), it's not really worth pursuing a late game goal, counter to your own intuition. As a side note, the tech-tree at first is fascinating, but with a descent amount of play-time you realise it's very homogenous in the end. (It never really ends, just small perks that you can keep researching and are cummulative)Despite the lacking late-game playability, this game is really interesting and exciting. You really feel immersed as a new galactic civilisation, and discovering new and interesting things as you play keeps you wanting to play more. As a space simulation, this game is excellent. Real-time space battles are a beauty to watch as well.On the whole, a very enjoyable, but short-lived experience. 8/10			"

												I recommend to buy the game, but not right now. The game is great and I had a lot of fun playing it, but some things are simply too irritating in the long run. Compared to crusader kings and universalis which I loved the game does not meet that standard.The game needs a lot of fixing and Paradox even agree to that. I am going to give it half a year of rest and then hopefully it has improved. Lots of kudos for the vision of the game less for the execution of it, hopefully Paradox will improve the game over the coming months to meet their high standard.			"

tl;dr It is nearly 3 AM and I can't stop playing this game.  This game is amazing!This game is a fabulous eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate game. The exploration is especially engrossing. This reminds me of a real time MOO2, which is a darn good thing.The game is far(!) easier to pick up and play than another Paradox Interactive game, Crusader Kings II.The biggest CON of I note for this game so far is that it is going to keep me from getting all the sleep I need.

												I have played this game more than any other right from the start because it has been very entertaining and once I started to figure out what was happening it got even better.  I have restarted about 12 times because I wanted to try variations on traits and personalities but I like the universe I am in this time so I might finish in this one although I think it will take some time.  It is fun colonizing planets and negotiating (or killing) your alien neighbors.  I was collecting life forms but I new I needed border access to a neighbor to get the last one.  They weren't willing to let me in but my allies declared war on them and when we won I could send my science ship in to get it :)  Clearing out monsters and keeping your economy balanced takes a bit of work but it is fun and keeps you thinking.  I almost saved a planet from deadly plants that started out making my colonists happier by ""co-existing"" with them until they mutated and turned the planet into a toxic wasteland.  So sad for the colonists... I really like the game so far and will keep playing it for some time.The steam achievements only seem to work on ironman hmm oh well I don't care so much maybe later...  Check out youtube Stellaris Blorg.  If you like what you see then you will like this game.Update over 100 hours still playing...  Asteroids are much easier to stop when you have a massive fleet instead of three corvettes busy running around doing other stuff.  Many empires have joined our federation.  Many others are fearful.  Some we have eased the fear by vassalizing >:)   Now they do what I want.  Never have enough energy credits still lots of planets to colonize.  Still having fun.One thing that would be nice would be if there were some differences to races other than the pictures.  Basically you can make any race do any thing-it might be more fun to pick a race and see how that works for you with a predefined trait (and encounter them in the game).  All races are the same no matter what they look like though.Still only a minor issue really.  Might add to this later-going to play now!Update:  Empire now spans almost half the galaxy.  Every so often we find someone to have a border skirmish with (either when I am Federation President to make another vassal  or when one of my other fed members becomes aggressive).  Major problems energy drain from massive infrastructure and fleet size (almost 100k altogether) draining over 214 energy per month after allowing for all my income.  Fortunately there are other empires with extra energy that kinda say they like me (possibly because I vassalized them...).  I think the big problem is this huge fleet though.  Hmm what to do about that?  Suddenly a huge dimensional rift opened up with nasty aliens that want to eat everybody.  I have a plan for all these extra ships now.  Maybe I won't have to pay so much maintenance if the aliens wreck some...The mid and end game needs work though.  I played this a long time and I really did like it but once you have the power to take on a Fallen Empire then you keep fighting people and getting a little bit further.  Win wars and you can vassalize or annex a few planets but it takes A LONG TIME to win a military victory.  I didn't enjoy the end game as much but I played to finish to see what would happen.  Eventually I terraformed most of the planets in my controlled area and won a colonization victory but there were no flashy victory screens and I felt like it was okay but I didn't really get moved by the ending or even get a nice reward screen saying I was the greatest commander the United Nations of Earth every had etc etc... (and really race makes NO DIFFERENCE at all play whatever you like they are all the same).For different playstyles you can pick three different types of faster than light travel (I like the hyperdrive the best and didn't bother trying wormholes yet although they are pretty fast I guess once you set them up.  Also you can choose starting lasers, projectile, or missile weapons.  Those are your major starting differences.I might play this again later, it is a good game and fun at the start for sure.  I think I got my money's worth but I don't like being so limited by influence that you have to ration what you do or set systems free just so you can recover influence and repeat and repeat.  Having negative influence when you control 30% of the galaxy seems unrealistic to me.I still recommend this game but nothing at the moment will be something you can play forever without eventually getting bored I guess.

												Cannot recommend, game has good ideas. Like Roleplay, 4X, RTS hybrid. Features and executions is sloppy at least. Generally must be extensively modded to be enjoyed because vanilla features are just plain bad such as the combat balance, the tech balance, the diplomacy balance, and a few more. On the plus side you can mod this game to death. On the down side, each mod greatly affects game performance even on slightly above average rigs.			"

												So bad I had to write a review. Sectors are broken, ship AI is broken, AI diplomacy is broken. Late game has little to no game play other than building fleets and lagging through battles. Whole sections of tech are literally worthless; defensive structures are paper thin and completely not worth building for example. All in all it's terribly balanced with terrible mechanics and just... it's just terrible. This is the worst Paradox game I've ever played....I've played nearly every paradox game to be released, and this is by FAR the worst. Zoft ruined EU4 with his dumbass Coalition system and it took him being moved to Stellaris for that to be fixed, and now he's ruined an entire new game with his♥♥♥♥♥♥mechanics. Why he was project lead on this is beyond me, and what's even more surprising is that after all his terrible design choices he still has a job.			"

												Literally the only space 4x game I can play and enjoy in the ever-growing, saturated game market of 4x space games.  The launch has a handful of bugs, but that can be said of any Paradox title.  Just realize that Paradox is good at supporting their games, so these bugs will get addressed sooner than later.  With the positive critical response this game is receiving, get ready for loads of DLC in the near future (I expect this to be as big/mainstream as CK2 is/was). Also, it's mod friendly (Steam workshop).  Overall, buy it.  Buy it if you like space 4x games.  Buy it if you like Civ.  Buy it if you like Paradox grand strategy titles.  If you can only own one space 4x game, this should be it.			"

Pair that with my love of Star Trek, which I've been watching since I could crawl - and you have Stellaris.I feel like this game deserves such a more well written review, but that literally is what it is - Civilization meets Galactic Exploration/War/Diplomacy - aka Civilization: Star Trek.If you love Star Trek, and love Civilization - BUY THIS GAME!My first night I played a 13 hour game session, and the next day I hit 21 hours easily.

												This is a cautious recommend.Like most Paradox games there is a ton of possibility waiting to be unlocked by piles of DLC. I don't know if they do this on purpose or just throw a half-baked idea out there and see where the players ask for things to be filled in later. The ability to create a race is neat but doesn't seem to make much difference that I've seen since you can pick any type of race and the traits which create the modifiers are available to any race whether a cat person or a fungus person. The AI players are incredibly passive and their war strategy boils down to making a huge fleet and launching it at you. If you can beat that giant fleet you win every time and they will just spend the rest of the war sending ships at you piecemeal as they complete them and you can just go planet to planet picking off the enemy where you want. The AI is also quite happy to surrender after a few setbacks I've yet to see one fight to anything like a proper ending. You are allowed to conquer only so many planets after that limit it goes to the AI controlled sectors that the AI can't properly manage you will be reduced to tears as you watch how poorly a job the AI does with your conquered/colonized planets. Ship designer is pick parts A,B,C and not nearly as awesome as the designer in Galactic Civilizations.Diplomacy is worthless and the AI basically greets you when you discover them and then ignores you until war is declared.Okay enough complaining what doesn't suck?The random events are pretty neat. Your colonists will gradually evolve on their own forming new factions or even literally evolving into distinct races on their own and leading to infighting which will destroy buildings or lead to race wars costing countless lives.The research tree is clever you pretty much get the same techs each game but they are unlocked in different orders so you can't just rush the same techs every game since some are offered earlier or later (even MUCH later) than others each time. You can replace your people with robots that will happily toil on ice covered worlds without complaining like your lazy organic subjects do.You can move populations from planet to planet or launch a genocide to purge less cooperative factions or races you've conquered that don't appreciate your rule. Bird people not digging your fungus despotism? Kill 'em all. Replace them with robots. There is much to like but much that is awful or not quite there if you want a fully fleshed out alternative to Galactic Civilizations (my benchmark for space 4X goodness) this isn't it. In time I think this game will give Galactic Civilizations a run for their money but at this point it is a ""meh"". A good ""meh"" but still a ""meh"".			"

												Stellaris is an amazing game. like most other paradox titles its a grand strategy/RTS/sandbox game; with a space setting.the game allows for a ton of freedom and customization in many areas the only one i find lacking is the government/ethics selections. Not in that they cant be changed or anything but rather certain traits handcuff you to a governemnt. this is just my one little gripe, but you may find it suffciant.The tutorial eases you in decently. some paradox games will throw you into the fire with bare minimum knowledge, which i am critical of, but stellaris sufficiantly gave it some effort. not great but enough.like most other paradox games, its going to take awhile to learn the game in and out, theres a massive amount to memorize and keep track of at once.(which leads me into the next part)When i play a game like civ, after i grow to a extremely large nation i tend to get bored maintaning every fabric of my nation. stellaris takes out this extra maintenance by allowing you to add sectors. basically the system is a very simple version of the one used in CK2. you simply select the area of the sector and if you please, assign a governer, and the system will competently handle work in that sector. super simple, and sooooo helpful.for those of you who love mods, be at home, paradox will let you do whatever you want. although i only run 1 mod in stellaris and its purely a visual mod (Zbuetiful battles mod). to contrast this game to a game i believe to be sub par. i run that 1 visual mod to run stellaris, while when i play XCOM 2 i usually run about 20+ mods at once. this is just a testment to how good stellaris is, it really doesnt need tweaking. Because the game is so flexable customization wise, i can see this game before modding to have tremendous replay value. once you add mods you could probably play this until your PC dies (or you do)100% recommend this game for the freedom to take your nation wherever it wants in small details or larger ideas.

												Don't get me wrong, this is a brilliant game! I love it! But I hate it...There is so much it gets right but so much it gets wrong too. I was hoping the latest patch 1.3 was going to fix a lot of the issues but all it did was swap them out for new ones, the latest of which is the game highlights which planets on the galaxy map you can colonise with a good habitability, until you build a robot, and then it tells you every planet is a good habitability planet (even though you can't build robot settlers to begin with). It seems a small thing but this coupled with other issues like, to remove a system from a sector costs 25 influence, even if you misclick one in, means the game feels buggy and not reallly out of Beta yet. Also, if you have a strategic resource in one sector (to buff a ships attack for example) that resource is limited to that sector, so it's not much good to you away from the front line shipyards.The galaxy creation settings are quite limited I've found, the difficulty settings start from medium and go to insane so there's no room for casuals here, the distance from capital happiness penalties have also been increased, and the list goes on. Don't forget the stupid AI that will fly a civilian ship straight through through the 800 power fleet rather than flying around the edge of the system to avoid it.If you, like me, can overlook these features for the rest of the game and are happy to babysit it and endure the bad points then you'll be happy with the purchase but otherwise it's not worth the price tag right now or the foreseeable future.There is a brilliant modding community right now and the developers are actively working on it correcting things that shouldn't have been in the game to begin with.The empire management is great, the tabs and windows and information is all accessible and easy to access, building and planning is easy to do and the AI of your sectors isn't half bad, research is fun and unpredicatable so you can't just build a great library to win because you may not get the research you need come up. There are so many original ideas in this game that other games are now picking up on and adding to their own series.			"

												Essentially a cross between EU's real-time gameplay and GalCiv's theme and base-building.  It's a largely competent, good-looking game.  And it's done well with the interface, which is a stumbling block for some other 4x games.  Its biggest shortcoming is the diplomcy system, which leads to idiotic scenarios like you declaring war on a neighbor just so that you can get your ships inside their borders to finish a research mission.  The ""blob combat"" from other Paradox games returns, complete, with fussy micromanagement of combat units that somehow feels less ""grand strategy"" and more ""herding cats"" as you chase (or run from) enemy fleets round and round.It really is not a bad first effort.  Much better than GalCiv, Endless Space, etc. were when they first appeared.  But it has a lot of problems, and the updates since launch have been hit and miss: diplomcy is worse in some ways than at launch, for example.  I should have stuck with the tried and true ""buy Paradox games 2 years after they release when they are finally fixed"" strategy.			"

												I took a break from Stellaris nine months ago because it was just too under-developed. Its diplomacy, warfare, mid-game monotony, and clunky interface were just too draining. Research, exploration, species customization, and the aesthetics had me playing for such a long time, but eventually I was burnt out in a bad way.The dlc Utopia and the latest patch were released recently, so I decided to wade back into the waters. With the new customization, building, and internal political options, I was hooked back in for another absurdly long stretch. However, I'm burnt out again by the same unresolved, under-developed systems. I've played this game way too long to be able to tell you it's a bad game or that you shouldn't buy it. But I kept playing wanting to get over the things that I can't stand. I don't think I'll be playing again until the next update, and I don't want people who just have a passing interest to  take the risk on this. It's certainly not Paradox's best or most complete game. One year in, it feels like it still shouldn't have been released. I'll update as it updates.			"

StellarisNote: Each field is weighted differently, and thus affects the overall score differently.  Field Rating Review   Graphics 9 Overall, the graphics are very well done, particularly the art of the races. The only downside I would say, is that battles feel a bit lackluster. The ships all clump together and it makes the battles difficult to enjoy as it is hard to see anything (particularly if there are any aura effects). Luckily, mods quickly solve this issue!   Gameplay 9 Stellaris is a deeply complex game, but you would never guess it right away. There are so many ways to manage your empire, let alone your fleet. The complexity of the game is well hidden beneath an interface that is incredibly easy to navigate. Here are some examples of what you can do: Create Sectors in your empire that can be auto-managed by the ai (focusing on fields you tell it to), declare edicts in each of those sectors, customize each ship design in your fleet, research a vast array of technologies, declare war on various empires using a war point system, form alliances, form federations, assign governors, assign admirals, assign generals, assign scientists, research various anomalies around the galaxy, allow open migration of races between borders, influence primitive populations you discover, purge populations, decide between several types of government (military dictatorship, democracy, etc), deal with various factions that arise in your empire with subterfuge, demand another empire free some of their planets, fight forgotten empires...The list goes on and on. My friend and I have put in over 20 hours just to ONE game, and it isn't even the largest map type (up to 1000 stars, and more with mods). This is galactic war on a grand scale. Manage multiple fleets, balance resources, and strike out alone, or with your friends, to become the supreme power in the universe. There are also surprise events that happen in the game, such as various alien invasions, or robot uprisings. Overall, a fantastically done 4x RTS. You can pause, or speed up time. The only downside I've found is how hard it is to conquer another empire. Due to the war point system you cannot simply roll over another empire and claim it all as yours, you can only take a set number of planets (or you can make them vassals).   Story N/A The only story here is the one you write yourself as you spread your empire.   Multiplayer 10 Some of the largest multiplayer battles you will ever encounter in an RTS. Play against, or with, up to 32 players. Ally with your friends, forge rivalries or fragile treaties with others.  Immensely fun for everyone involved.    Replayability 9 With so many factions to play, and so many different ways to play, you can try all kinds of various paths before you'll burn out on Stellaris.   Overall 9.1/10 Paradox has done it again. A masterpiece of a game, and a surprise hit (for me). I normally shy away from 4x titles, but Stellaris caught my eye and I gave it a go. Finally, my RTS itch has been scratched. A highly complex game hidden beneath a deceptively simple interface, Stellaris welcomes players of any skill level to come and enjoy conquering the galaxy. So dive in, and be prepared to smile as you expand your empire, laugh at your enemies demands, or watch in horror as an invading alien force rolls across the galaxy, and only you and you friends stand in its way.

												A cautious recommendation, because the current game is good and has solid mechanics , but is actually more of a foundation for a great game. If you want to buy it, wait till Clarke or preferably Asimov updates so as to get the proper experience ,as there are still alot of bugs and imbalances , but once those are ironed out it will be worth a full price purchase ( even in its current state people are putting 50+ hrs in so that should tell you something ).Pros : - the big one: it is to me the first game that feels like im actually building a space empire          - lots of customization          - bunch of mods          - meaningful race design choices ( ftl , race traits , ethics )          - interesting research system ( weighted card based , but takes too long to explain )          - it is an actual strategy game so its your strategy that dictates your success          - sectors ( alot of people hate them , for me its fine , they are very inefficient , but you can work around it if             you want to and it saves me from the micro hell of mid and late game in singleplayer)          - the stories it creates ( note not storytelling to there are some good easter eggs , but the stories you make by             playing it )          - RNG ( in starting position , events and tech , i like it) Cons: -it feels like a modulless spacestation that still has major kinks ( hopefully Asimov and Clarke will work those out )          -this means that you can feel where there will be addons to the game as some areas feel pretty barebones             ( the major areas for me are diplomacy , war goals , sector control , stuff to do mid and late game , especially               victory goals) again they are solid bones , just bare           - the Ai.... it has ""quirks"" and is the reason i would emphasize waiting for the next two big patches as they will             focus alot on fixing it ( it doesnt react to late game crisises , follows your fleets around like a pack of              baby ducklings and it sometimes gets stuck in wars with it self  ,are the more deal breaking ones that             will hopefully be fixed )          - RNG ( if you dont like it in those areas ) Overall for me very novel and enjoyable experience that i will come back to once its fixed and every  update after.

												Absolutely loved the game until 1.2 patch.  They effectively turned the game from a 4X to a 3X by removing early game exploration as a viable option.  But it was well with the money, and I really love what they did with the game before 1.2.  Now, unfortunately, it's unplayable for me.  I understand what the developers have tried to do - they want space battles to be more spread out so they increased weapon ranges, and they wanted to stop the hopping from system to system fleet wars.  Unfortunately, their solution killed early game exploration, and that, in turn, kills the game for me.			"

												I'm a huge fan of Paradox Games. I've put hunderds -  even thousands - of hours into CK2 and HoI2 and many others of their games. When I first heard of Stellaris, it sounded like a dream come true; finally a grand strategy space game in the way that only Paradox makes strategy games!As such I really wanted to like the game. Truly, I wanted to find things to love in it.But I can't. The game is, simply put, boring. It's a combination of turn based and real time strategy games and roleplaying games, but it doesn't shine in any of these genres. Hearts of Irons have amazing strategical depth, which makes those games interesting. Crusader Kings 2 has less strategy, but it has awesome emergent gameplay from its roleplaying elements.Stellaris does none of that. There's no real deep strategy to it; you learn the optimal colony spamming strategies and whatnot in mere few hours. There's not much of a tactical element either; the tactical AI will prove zero challenge to you. Plus, the best tactic is simply having the bigger numbers, that's it. There's an attempt at a rock-paper-scissor system in dealing and deflecting damage, but it's so streamlined that it could just as well not be there at all.The roleplaying elements are sorely lacking. Yes, you can design your own species, but the choices are really not as diverse as I was led to believe. You develop no relationship with any of the members of your species, as they have no personality and no individual say to anything. Diplomacy with other factions is extremely predictable and based pretty much solely on how the traits of species interact.Most of the game is you putting it to 3x speed and just waiting for things to happen, things that happened in the last game just the same.In summation, it feels like Stellaris tries to be a combination of real time strategy, turn based strategy and roleplaying, but fails to do any of those aspects well. Stellaris is a game that has vision for what it could be, but no vision for how it could achieve its ambitious goals.Generally, I don't recommend the game. There simply are much better alternatives to it.			"

												I've loved the time I've been able to spend with this game so far. Paradox have made a hybrid of a 4x and their traditional Grand Strategy titles (with a facelift) and it works quite well. The focus on diplomacy, the semi-random tech system, highly customisable races and the end game events keep playthroughs quite fresh; which is much more than you can say for other games with this setting - I'm looking at you Masters of Orion! Easy drop-in multiplayer make it a fantastic pick if you've got a few friends who're into strategy gaming.It's not perfect, but with future expansions lined up and full mod support from day 1... maybe one day it'll be pretty close to it. Well worth the price.			"

												This game has an huge potential, really huge: limited only by the developer's imagination.Unfortunately at the moment the game lacks in content: the first game, especially the first dozen of hours, looks great. But when you play it a second time you discover that you have already seen most of the events! I think that in all my games (but one) I have met the annoying space pirates: the first time is “Wow!”, the second time you know already that you need at least 6 corvettes to win easily, after that it becomes just a chore. The huge galaxy becomes hugely boring.On top of this the UI is far from perfect: for example it lacks common features like a list/report with our ships (useful to decide what to build) or a list/report with all our space stations (useful to know exactly what is being built). The idea of the AI managing your sectors in theory is good but currently is badly implemented: the AI under performs and you cannot overseed it.So my suggestion, if you like this kind of game, is to wait a couple of years or that 5/6 paid DLC are out, before to buy it (of course during a sale!).

												I hate to write a negative review, but in this game's current state, I just don't find it enjoyable.  I realize it's a grand strategy game and not a war game, but winning wars is tedious to say the least.  In the current build, the path to victory is pump out all the corvettes you can support and swarm the enemy fleet.  That's what they're going to go ahead and do.  Anything larger is really a waste.As far as the game in general, it's slow.  REALLY slow.  If you've ever played a Paradox style game before, I guess you'll like this.  I do not.  You'll wait many long minutes for something, ANYTHING, to happen.  There's a building for minerals, one for energy, and one for science.  There's some unique buildings thrown in the mix but overall, that's it.  Pretty dull and repetitive to me.  The crises and events that can spring up are ok but nothing you haven't seen done better in GalCiv.If you like Paradox games, you may love this one.  If you don't, I advise you to think very hard about spending your money here.			"

												I put 40 hours into this game within the first week of having it. That's a full work week, but to be fair I was sick...This is one of the best 4x strategy games I have ever had the pleasure of picking up and playing. Once you get your hands on this game it will be extremely difficult to put it down. I've already dedicated 2 full nights to this game and see many more in the future.Stellaris can be intimidating when you first start playing. I'm a fan of 4x strategy and even I was a little wary of everything going on in this game. The good thing is that Paradox crafted an amazing tutorial that guides you through everything you need to know. I definitely recommend turning the tutorial to full even if you have 4x experience. Don't expect to crush the AI the first time you play either. While the tutorial is great there is so much depth to the game that it takes a few playthroughs to start figuring out your play style and how best to play it.You start off by selecting your empire. You can choose from a bunch of preset empires or you can craft your own. I definitely suggest crafting your own, it's entertaining and you can really tailor the empire to your needs. A quick tip from me, wormhole is one of the better travel options in my opinion. It’s not a hard concept so don't be off-put by the (advanced players) tag attached to it.Once you're done fine tuning your empire it's time to choose your ""map/galaxy"". You have different map sizes to choose from, the amount of players/factions (30+). the shape of the map, how many AI get to start off better than you, difficulty, and if you want to play Iron Man (Auto-save only). If you are looking to unlock achievements, then you need to play in Iron Man mode. If you want to use console commands or save whenever to be able to reload and make better decisions, then turn Iron Man off.Now that you have the game ready to go it is time to start your adventure in an unknown galaxy. You get plopped into a random star system in the galaxy and begin your journey. Your AI robot will pop up and this is where you go full/tips only/none for tutorial. The robot I found to be a wonderful companion, I loved the dialogue and his duty to helping you understand the vastness of everything ahead of you.You get a home planet, a starting spaceport, a construction ship, a science vessel, and a fleet of 3 corvette ships. You begin by surveying your system, then building another science vessel and surveying some more. In fact, you spend A LOT of time in this game surveying. You need to get out there and discover everything that is amazing and fun. You will run into some very interesting dialogues and quest lines from surveying. It’s important to know everything you can know about everything going on around you.You also start the process of building and expanding your empire. You build a few mining stations in your system and mining nodes on your home planet to start that cash flow rolling in. There are 2 places you build. Upon the surface of any planets you have colonized, and in the orbit of stars and planets in the systems you explore. You need to find that healthy balance of energy and minerals to keep your empire going. Influence is another resource you get as well. It is very slow in the early game to accumulate and certain things like alliances will drain your influence even more. It is one of your most valuable resources. You need it to expand your borders, to recruit leaders, and to setup policies and edicts that help your style of play and help you adapt to what’s going on around you.Your leaders are very important as well. You need them to govern your planets and sectors, to research new technologies, to man your science vessels, and to lead your armies. You start off with a few already but will soon need to recruit more with the influence you have gained. They level up as you use them and gain their own traits as well. They do age and die so they all have expiration dates which means you will always need some influence to recruit more. It's sad when you lose that scientist who hit 5 stars and basically excelled you through years of research by surveying tech in the vastness of space.As you expand you begin to make contact with your neighbors. If you are lucky you run into more peaceful/tolerable aliens at first. This allows you to initiate the first move. Do you want to take them out or do you want to use them as a potential ally? There is only so much space and everyone is growing so eventually you will have to take someone out to be able to expand more yourself. With that being said, don't rush into any wars. You need to plan everything out before you launch an all-out assault. Make sure your fleet capacity is at full and you have an attack plan. Also be sure to have enough cash flow to afford the war. You can't fight if you are broke. Be ready for the AI to warp to your home system while you are in the middle of attacking theirs. The AI can be devious like that sometimes. War isn't easy and you spend a lot of time attacking then licking wounds then attacking again. Your first war is usually the easiest. Lesser techs and less to deal with. Once you get into alliances and federations, you start getting into warfare like you've never seen before. Things get crazy and the wars seem to last forever. You better hope you chose the right allies. My second war I was severely under-powered for and I lost horribly. It was basically game over and time to start fresh again.This game takes some time to master and you will most likely lose your first few games before you start making head way but you won't care because you will be having fun the entire time.This game offers a lot of depth and detail and a rich environment to experience it all in. You can easily lose hours upon hours to this game and care less about where the time has gone. If you are a fan of 4x strategy or even if you are playing for the first time, then this is the game for you. It is worth every penny and we still have more content to look forward too.			"

												I have about 24hs on this game and I gotta say, I am disappointed.This game is so full of interesting concepts marred by weird design choices. It might grow to be what I'd consider a great game, but not without a serious rework of some parts of the game.I mean, the exploration minigame? funBut...Let me explain.t's start with the planets.Planets in Stellaris are little but glorified resource bases. You have a number of slots pr planet, the slots have some naturally occurring resource that you might want t exploit with an extraction facility (or not), the resource can be energy, minerals, research or food (and the latter is local exploitation only), you can't move resources between planets, but that is ok because THERE IS NO INDUSTRY. Yes there are some happiness/habitability buildings (but happiness,  has little effect on the tile yield) and a few other misc buildings that, the best they can do is increase the resource cap or the local forces (at least that I've seen thus far)Things get built in an arbitrary time, no mater the planet habitability, the development of the planet or its population.Buildings are magicked, without rime or reason and it gets worse.The orbital industry is abstracted as a spaceport that, again, takes the same time to be built in your coreworld or in the most further out, half forgotten colony.Spaceports build your spaceships, simple enough, but again the build time of these is arbitrary (for military ships you can reduce the time by having the proper facility at the spaceport) but they can only build one ship at the same time AND if you queue multiple hulls the mineral cost gets deducted up front for all of them (something that makes queuing annoying micro/pointless but more of this latter on)So, you will never have to juggle in the development of your planets, no Industry vs. Pollution ala MOO or have to handle with crime or have more pops than food and ship in the difference.All planets are dreadfully alike and don't seem to be very alive, if at all.Moving on, then we have the Star System, they are surprisingly barren, When I said colonies were your resource bases I wasn't kidding, most systems have only a few resource locations and they pale in comparison to what a planet can generate. Here we have the first issue of inconsistency in the game. See, most stars don't even generate energy for you to build a mine (solar collector facility?) but if you have a spaceport in system you might be able to equip, at the spaceport, a solar array module that provides you a flat +5 energy, never mind the kind of star or the distance from the planet or the yield of the mine build around said star Mines/research facilities are simplistic, they work and add their yield to the respective pools, but they have no pop in them, deliver their yields instantly and you can't even design them/upgrade them (so not only is their initial yield their only yield, but they are very, very fragile and there is nothing you can do about it) Yes, you can add system defense stations (of different sizes) but those? you can't upgrade and their range and effectivity is limited at best, might be enough to buy time to your fleets to arrive, but it is only an expensive speed-bump.Pops are, in my opinion, one the biggest let down in Stellaris. they are limited and simplistic. I was not expecting a pop as complex as Victoria, but what we got is... cardboard.Starting with the fact that pops are either there, growing or fully developed. They don't fluctuate in size, and if present (assuming a reasonable Happiness) they will work the tile assigned to its fullest potential. Ethic drift is an interesting idea and it works, but it is the only thing that might make a pop interesting but there is nothing to it. Factions that the pops can be part of have very, very little variety, so far I've only seen independentists, looking for idnependence either for your sectors, or your subjugated species, there is no ""change govt type"" or ""want to go to war with X"" or ""Make peace with Y"" or ""we want this policy changed"" they seem to have next to no agenda and that is a pity, I was looking forward having to juggle the pops opinions once my empire got big enough...Pops are planet-bound and have little effect on the galaxy at large, actually they are a hindrance to research, apparently the more pops the higher are the costs of the techs being researched.Sectors. Paradox sold us sectors as a way to deal with the tedious micro (that they saddled planets with) it is an interesting mechanic, but... it falls short. First the AI has, currently, issues with working the sector planets anywhere near efficient (it has a tendency to shuffle pops from big yield tiles to lesser yield tiles of the same kind, or assigning slaves to work at tiles they are ill suited for) Worse, you can interact with the sectors only in the most basic of ways assigning a type of priority to the sector (but can't ask for a balanced option) and, for instance , cant insure the planets in sector have all Frontier Clinics and with as rubbish is the AI at building up sectors, the ability of assigning more direct orders wouldn't be amiss (even at an increased mineral cost or at an additional influence value or some other consequence at micromanaging your governors as you see fit)See, this is the thing, we all have different micromanagement thresholds and this is not only about the quantity of micro, but of the types. some people enjoy microing more than others, so instead of doing as Distant Worlds did and giving us the ability to choose how much micro we would go for, they set up arbitrary numbers which, while they can work for a multiplayer game, the singleplayer experience is my chief interest and, yes, this can be modded, but it is not a straightforward thing of simply modding the coreworld limit, there are governments that increase coreworld count and techs that do the same, and the latter two needs to be modified in such a way that the former offers something to the player, while the latter needs to be changed or removed. So, yes MODS can do it, but they will lack the polish that Paradox could have given the mechanic.Going back to Sectors, they are inconsistent. See you can only have a handful of directly controlled core worlds... Sectors have no such limitation and while it is probably not a good idea to make the sectors too big , they have no ill effect from being huge.As the game progresses and you start to unlock other colonizable worlds (especially those that are close to your race preferred type), so more and more planets can be colonized, making sectors bigger and bigger by colonizing within your borders, this makes me think that the current Coreworld set up is less than agile, core systems would have been much, much better for long term.Thing is, I should be enticed to use the Sector System, not forced, I should have quantifiable advantages in designing a sector and including systems into them, instead I have penalties if I don't do so and I hate being coerced because reasons.Ships, The current slot system feels rather restrictive, you can choose to use better engines but, never can change the % of mass the engines occupy or the ships RCS thursters (Engine manages both speed and agility in this game, so FAST=Agile), It works but it feels lame and could use deep (since we can't command the battles, we might as well optimize our ships to its fullest) Range of the ships is unlimited, assuming you can jump to the next system (which can be an issue in some maps) you can go as far from your furthest port, for as long as you like, without ill effects. this affects all your ships , even colony ships, so you can have colonies all over the place, with no ill effect.Hell it can even be advantageous to box in rival empires.And I am out of space. Bottom line? wait for the expansions and even then it is not certain they will fix Core design Issues "

Semi-custom Ship Designs, multiple weapons tech paths and the ability to study enemy tech from ships you defeat allow for amazing fluidity with you fleet and your tactics. Anomilies will keep you interested in exploring the galaxy even long after you have won the game. If you are a Sins fan you will surely enjoy this game.			"

												Stellaris is exactly what I wanted in a space game, and it does an excellent job of meshing 4X with Grand Strategy.What I love most, and expect many love most about the game, is the create your own species which allows you to choose your traits, FTL type (Warp, Hyperlanes and Wormholes), ship look, government type, species ethics, appearance even ship prefix. It will alter your entire game and your playstyle for that game. It's probably what makes Stellaris great to be honest.After having set up your species and started the game, that initial burst of exploration and expansion is executed almost perfectly. Sending out your science ship to survey and explore other systems isn't just some mindless task of clicking from one system to the next as anomalies and research projects pop up in your situation log. This leads it to be far more immersive than any other 4X space game I know of at the moment, leading to weird and sometimes exciting events such as a brand of ultra-reactionary religious quacks breaking off from your empire to take a stand against your purging policy. Or your scientists finding a ceramic pot drifting around a sun that they just.. Can't explain. All this means that exploration isn't just ""oh. a planet to colonise, great. NEXT SYSTEM."" The land grab stage is also done incredibly well as you aim to cut off your opponents in a desperate grab for planets and minerals. Establishing frontier outposts and desperately trying to build colony ships in order to expand your borders. But make no mistake, there is no need for you to grab as much as you can. I've been three times the size of the AI and they've STILL had superior tech and equivelant fleet power/capacity to me. It's possible to build not just wide, but tall and that's done so well in the this game, in comparison to other games such as Sins of a Solar Empire where it's alllllll about the wide. Colonising is a relatively simple affair of sending your colony ship to X habitable planet, then settling there, waiting a year or two for it to be established and then bam, you have your colony; planets however aren't just things that set down borders, they'll be your main income for science/minerals/energy if you min/max one or the other. Every planet has a planet surface tab, which is divided into multiple squares consisting of as little as 5 up to 25 and this is where it starts to look a bit like Civ. Each tile has a natural resource within it which can either be exploited or ignored and built over to provide a different resource, in order to harvest said resource the tile requires an active pop be living on it; which are grown through the amount of food you have (Currently there is no point to having a surplus of food on a fully popped planet). Pops can be resettled between different planets within your core sector allowing you to keep your eithical bloodline pure.Now, many 4X games descend into tedious micro-management of -every- planet and system that you own, which obviously a lot of people aren't all that in to. Some like spreadsheets, some don't. Stellaris attempts to alleviate this with something I've not seen in other space games as of yet, it allows you to break up your empire into ""sectors"", the number of sectors allowed is based on your population and planets owned. This sector is essentially an AI which will manage and govern the area you portion out to it. You can choose to assign each sector a governor who will convey specific bonuses to the entire sector. The sector doesn't just micromanage the planets though; you can allow it to redevelopment tiles on planets, and set it a specific function; such as military, minerals, research or credits. The sector AI will then attempt to do it's utmost best to supply as much of the chosen function as possible, except for military sector AI who will build military stations and strengthen their borders with space-station defenses, defending armies, etc. A lot of people have moaned that the sector AI seems woefully incompetent and doesn't really seem able to balance itself out; now this is incorrect, at the start you may notice that it is minus on energy credits for a while, this is because it doesn't have it's planets infrastructures built yet; simply pour minerals and energy into it and you'll see it even out, and eventually it'll even surpass itself. I've been provided with up to 400+ minerals by my sectors alone at times. They really do become incredibly good.As time goes by it starts to morph into a GSG more than a 4X game, with an emphasis on war and diplomacy. They're not as fleshed out as a lot of people were hoping for. I was expecting what we got since I read all the DD's and didn't expect anything more. War is a very set in stone thing. You declare war for specific wargoals such as cede X planet, and liberate X planets. Then it's simply a march to your wargoal (gained through winning batles, capturing planets, etc). 90% of the time the AI will surrender and hand it over to you should you be utterly stomping them. If they're winning however, they will go on winning unless you surrender and give them your systems. This is a rather brutal AI in that respect. Many however have complained that the AI seems overly passive, and while this can be the case it's more luck of the draw and power than anything. They'll only go to war with someone they're superior over, which is just basic sense really isn't it.. And they're less/more likely to go to war based on their ethics and government aswell.Diplomacy does need some work as it's rather basic right now, reminds me a lot of Sins of a Solar Empire with how basic it is, but I expect expansions and future content to change this. It's a relatively simple affair of alliance, rivalry, star charts. Trading is simply energy credits or minerals in an instant transfer or monthly. It's lacking basically, but it's more than sufficient for the game at current. Alliance blocks can turn into federations, with one nation that leads them which switches out every 5-10 years to a different nation.Research and tech. Boy, did they outdo themselves with this one. This deck-of-cards research system is simply amazing. I've found tech in some games I didn't know existed, only to never see it ever again in any other game. Basically it's split into three categories; physics, society and engineering. And within each category you'll get 3 techs to choose from, you pick one, research it, and when you go back to picking 3 again, it'll have shuffled and present all new options. Some are weighted to appear simply so you can advance in the game, such as colony ships, and spaceport upgrades, which makes sense otherwise you could get shafted hard. If your science ship surveys debris and finds certain tech then it will appear as a permanent tech option, below the normal three, that you can pick regardless of how many different techs you research.Overall, this is the game I've been waiting years for. It's exactly what I wanted in a Space 4X game, and it's growth into a GSG over time is well executed as it turns more to war/diplomacy. I want to note that this game isn't missing any features, it's just not fleshed out certain ones enough. Such as diplomacy, trade and managing factions. All of which are pretty basic right now, but that's to be expected when you think of the sheer scale this game has gone for. I'm all too happy to pay PDS money for DLC since I know that when they bring out expansion, it's actually an expansion for the game. I'm confident they'll continue to polish and add to this game for years and years to come just as they have for all their other titles/series: Victoria, Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis'Sorry if I missed anything, the games just got so many features and so much content, I'm sure I did miss something but hell, there's almost too much to write about! xD			"

												Stellaris is a space-age game crafted by the genius heads over at Paradox Interactive, known for titles such as Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis, Mount & Blade, and more. Not only does this game encapsulate what many games of the like have, but Stellaris improves upon them. You can see bits and pieces of what made games such as Endless Space, Homeworld, or Galactic Civilzations successful all in Stellaris. And it's graphics reqguirements? So low that almost anybody could play this game. On day 1, I spent roughly 10 hours playing before I noticed what had even happened to the time. This is how a Paradox game should go, and like other paradox games I've played, I can only hope to have my hours waste away in this game.All in all, I'd give this game a 9/10. Yes, some of it's mechanics need tweaking, however I expect community effort to help aid in that process. Keep up the good work Paradox! And when is Bannerlord coming out?			"

												Preface - I feel like anyone who would read this review as an unbiased, objective look on Stellaris and make use of it to decide whether or not the game is worth the purchase should know that I am a long time fan of Paradox Development and their previous games. Stellaris is definitely a game that you will enjoy if you enjoyed past Paradox games and are fine with waiting on updates and buying future DLC to enhance an already solid gaming experience. At that time Stellaris has had enough patches and updates over the course of a year I will gladly give it my 9/10, but since that has not happened yet, I rank it 7/10 with a positive tone. Behold, my review!PROS--------------1. The early game is very entertaining. It involves exploration, boldly going, etc. There is also a healthy dose of customization at the start to make a fun race of beings and then expand across the starts.2. Beautiful soundtrack. That's pretty much 'nuff said'. I enjoyed listened for the first 7 hours even if it wasn't as good as that one CK II song (CK II nerds know what I'm talking about).3. The game has a lot of neat little mechanics that haven't been featured in other Paradox games, but definitely fall in line with the evil stuff you can do in Crusader Kings. Population control is a big one, with forced relocation, purges, enslavement, and a whole host of other features in the game.4. I really like the science system in the game. It makes it feel much more realistic in the terms of tech research, which also keeps the game fresh and prevents players from doing their stereptypical 'tech routes'. 5. It's super easy to grasp and you can learn as you go!CONS--------------1. Stellaris does slow down mid game. This is something that most Paradox games suffer from, making them hard to stick with for so long. I feel like the dev's promise to make the mid game fun was a little underserved. 2. You will be waiting for more substance. Paradox loves to update their games, so it will take some time and money for the game to come into its own. 3. It is an odd combination of Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings, Civilization, and Sin of a Solar Empire. While the game has a lot of the good aspects of all these games, the hybrid pf GSG and 4X has the same pitfalls, such as taking a long time to get going and sometimes losing steam. Overall I feel as though this game deserves a positive review, but it will take sometime for it to come into its own.   "

												I'm 6 hours into my first play through as a Human military dictatorship and I'm very impressed! If you're a fan of the Masters of Orion series, you'll find a lot to like here. The spirit of those games lives here, but there are also a lot of parellels with modern 4x games. Stellaris feels like the rightful successor to Masters of Orion 2. The traditional ""Paradox"" learning curve in games like Europa Universalis or Crusader Kings doesn't apply to Stellaris. The game's UI is seemless but I highly recommend playing through the tutorial. Combat is enaging and there's no shortage of random aliens to dust it up with. Going up against other empires can be costly unless you have a clear technological and naval advantage. The diplomacy is very similar to Civ 4 or 5, but I've noticed a couple of glitches on the trade screen that I hope gets cleaned up in the coming weeks. Based on my early game impressions, if you're into space exploration and empire building games, you should definitely give Stellaris a shot.			"

												Yeah, so disregard what I previously said about Stellaris. My old review said that there wasn't a con I could think of and that it ran pretty well and looked good. Well, it still runs well and looks good, but I can think of a few cons.The major one is that it's repetitive. Basically, explore, colonize, fight wars, and repeat. That may sound like a lot of other games, but in this one there really isn't much else to do. Eventually it will get to a point where you've explored and colonized but now there's nothing left to do and you're waiting for something to happen. In other Paradox games, lets say Crusader Kings II, you only did nothing if you wanted to. There was always an opportunity to plot or fabricate claims and go to war. But in this game, you really can get to the point where there's nothing to do but micromanage your planets.In conclusion, there isn't yet nearly enough content to call this a full and fufilling game. This is Paradox, so I'm sure we'll get DLC, but that might not come for a while. I haven't played this game since the launch week because I got bored and I don't plan to play it again until more content is added. I'll keep my positive rating here, because it can be fun, but, right now, it isn't nearly at its full potential.			"

												It's a amazing framework for the best space strategy game of our time. It still lacks in some departments, but given that this is a Paradox game, we will get a lot of major expansions, patches and support in the next years that adds everything that is missing. But even now, it's already a wonderful game with amazing writing. If you like Grand Strategy, 4x or Space, you should buy this. Don't hold back, throw money at Paradox like it's saturday night in the strip club.			"

Posted: May 13, 2016
												Stellaris is exactly what I wanted in a space game, and it does an excellent job of meshing 4X with Grand Strategy.What I love most, and expect many love most about the game, is the create your own species which allows you to choose your traits, FTL type (Warp, Hyperlanes and Wormholes), ship look, government type, species ethics, appearance even ship prefix. It will alter your entire game and your playstyle for that game. It's probably what makes Stellaris great to be honest.After having set up your species and started the game, that initial burst of exploration and expansion is executed almost perfectly. Sending out your science ship to survey and explore other systems isn't just some mindless task of clicking from one system to the next as anomalies and research projects pop up in your situation log. This leads it to be far more immersive than any other 4X space game I know of at the moment, leading to weird and sometimes exciting events such as a brand of ultra-reactionary religious quacks breaking off from your empire to take a stand against your purging policy. Or your scientists finding a ceramic pot drifting around a sun that they just.. Can't explain. All this means that exploration isn't just ""oh. a planet to colonise, great. NEXT SYSTEM."" The land grab stage is also done incredibly well as you aim to cut off your opponents in a desperate grab for planets and minerals. Establishing frontier outposts and desperately trying to build colony ships in order to expand your borders. But make no mistake, there is no need for you to grab as much as you can. I've been three times the size of the AI and they've STILL had superior tech and equivelant fleet power/capacity to me. It's possible to build not just wide, but tall and that's done so well in the this game, in comparison to other games such as Sins of a Solar Empire where it's alllllll about the wide. Colonising is a relatively simple affair of sending your colony ship to X habitable planet, then settling there, waiting a year or two for it to be established and then bam, you have your colony; planets however aren't just things that set down borders, they'll be your main income for science/minerals/energy if you min/max one or the other. Every planet has a planet surface tab, which is divided into multiple squares consisting of as little as 5 up to 25 and this is where it starts to look a bit like Civ. Each tile has a natural resource within it which can either be exploited or ignored and built over to provide a different resource, in order to harvest said resource the tile requires an active pop be living on it; which are grown through the amount of food you have (Currently there is no point to having a surplus of food on a fully popped planet). Pops can be resettled between different planets within your core sector allowing you to keep your eithical bloodline pure.Now, many 4X games descend into tedious micro-management of -every- planet and system that you own, which obviously a lot of people aren't all that in to. Some like spreadsheets, some don't. Stellaris attempts to alleviate this with something I've not seen in other space games as of yet, it allows you to break up your empire into ""sectors"", the number of sectors allowed is based on your population and planets owned. This sector is essentially an AI which will manage and govern the area you portion out to it. You can choose to assign each sector a governor who will convey specific bonuses to the entire sector. The sector doesn't just micromanage the planets though; you can allow it to redevelopment tiles on planets, and set it a specific function; such as military, minerals, research or credits. The sector AI will then attempt to do it's utmost best to supply as much of the chosen function as possible, except for military sector AI who will build military stations and strengthen their borders with space-station defenses, defending armies, etc. A lot of people have moaned that the sector AI seems woefully incompetent and doesn't really seem able to balance itself out; now this is incorrect, at the start you may notice that it is minus on energy credits for a while, this is because it doesn't have it's planets infrastructures built yet; simply pour minerals and energy into it and you'll see it even out, and eventually it'll even surpass itself. I've been provided with up to 400+ minerals by my sectors alone at times. They really do become incredibly good.As time goes by it starts to morph into a GSG more than a 4X game, with an emphasis on war and diplomacy. They're not as fleshed out as a lot of people were hoping for. I was expecting what we got since I read all the DD's and didn't expect anything more. War is a very set in stone thing.

I just started up a new match as the Federation (of course from SST again) and am expanding like crazy having tons of fun.			"

You will be waiting for more substance. Paradox loves to update their games, so it will take some time and money for the game to come into its own. 3. It is an odd combination of Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings, Civilization, and Sin of a Solar Empire. While the game has a lot of the good aspects of all these games, the hybrid pf GSG and 4X has the same pitfalls, such as taking a long time to get going and sometimes losing steam. Overall I feel as though this game deserves a positive review, but it will take sometime for it to come into its own.   "

												-Start as militatantly individual materialist mushroom men. -Try to link up with friend but he mixes up east and west, expands wormholes the wrong direction but find 11 mineral system.-Start encountering other empires, steamroll them all with hyperaggressive tag team. -Meet fallen empire and suddenly turn into federation building shroom bros. -Get bored and start waging large scale alliance wars while trying to find another ally to see what federations do. -Friend turns in for the night and points out we've been playing for 8 hours. -It's OK, I give it a 10.

												Sollaris is GREAT! Its beautiful, it has a great style, it is a grand strategy game buuut it is also a work in progress compared to the other Paradox games.I love it to bits but already after about 10hours I can see that we have a grand scale but not the same tools as in EU IV for instance.There are no overlays for diplomatic considerations (ethos, ongoing wars, alliance/federation blocks, maybe border friction, ""powerlevel"" of fleets and tech, etc.).There is no ""ledger"" I need to accumulate my information myself from different windows.I would LOVE to automate constructionships in the midgame... Please just let me priorize my build order, allocate resources, pool some constructionships and off they fly never to bother me again... even an CIV5 ""automate worker"" button would suffice. So many clicks and the only choice is what to build first... All in all its GREAT  It has a great core gameplay, its clever game design is clearly visible. It will have a bright future but it has to grow first to compare to its great brothers and sisters, CKII, EUIV and likely also HOI4Going to play in smaller universes for the time being to reduce the necessary micromanagement.

												So, TLWR: The game has the potential to be one of the very best strategy games ever made. It is amazing. However it is unfinished.Read some of the issues below:Mid game issues, lack of inter and inner empire politics, unfinished alliance/federation dynamics, basically broken sector AI, shallow traits, imbalanced ethics, convergence divergence issues, unfinished factions system, very very little amount of scripted events, non-existent trade dynamics and mechanics, unfinished special resources system, lackluster UI, terrible invasion/ground army mechanics (needs a complete re-work), lack of depth in space battles (formations, tactics etc.), huge issues in FTL balance, imbalanced government types, lack of spirit and depth with fallen empires interactions, limited end game crises and bugs in their scripts, non-existent mid game crises, a huge ton of bugs (like orbital bombardment dynamics) and many many more (I have 46 hours played)Still, I think the game is a solid 9/10 with all the issues mentioned above.That is how good the game is. When they fix/finish the vanilla game and bring out patches+expansions, this game will be a golden classic. I can't wait for those.﻿			"

												I really wanted to love this game, I really REALLY did but I can't. While everyone says its a great game, and have faith that paradox will fix the game I don't. Lets start with the pro's shall we?Pros:+Great sound Track+Interesting unfolding storylines+Creating your own race+Creating your own empire with its own ethics+Finding many variations of empires and alien races+Fun In the start of the gameNegatives:-stale diplomacy-Terrible war score system-Glitchy combat-Glitched end game disasters-very few colony anomolies-stale mid-game-stale end game-sectors that create more mircomanging than fixing-Fallen EmpiresSO going more in depth with the game now I really wanted to like the game, I hyped and I even Pre-ordered the game because I was so excited, hell I couldn't even play other games, but when I got my hands on it my heart sank. While the graphics are great for the type of game and what was promised sounded so sweet the game ended up being infested with bugs and stale boring game play. In the begining of the game it starts out very well with you using science ships to explore the galaxy and encounter empires, find anomolies and begin your first few colonies. Soon you continue to grow and grow untill you hit that 5 planet cap max, and then its down from there. The game then forces you to use sectors which while sounding good created more issues as sectors can by your own choice take either 25% or 100% of the resources it holds inside taking away from you, and it then auto manages planets, which it does terribly as it has been known to not upgrade planets correctly and creat a draw on your resources instead of adding too them.We then soon reach the mid game where wars begin to errupt, and while on the small scale the system works magnificently it becomes terrible on the mid to large scale. If you have to many ships within a fleet the game becomes un-able to control them and when you enter combat ships do not fight correctly which if the enemy fleet glitches it becomes an easy fight, but if your fleet does it will stop in its tracks and refuse to fire its weapons correctly resulting in fleets that are double the size of an enemy to parrish despite having the perfect weapons for them. Diplomacy begins to become stale with the few amount of options and from the even fewer options for fallen empires. You can't even trade anything usefull to them as they refuse minerals and energy and won't trade anything but their own minerals and energy. With normal empires you can create alliances which work well surpisingly but then once it turns into a federation the game then it cycles through all nations inside of the federation for the next leader instead of voting a nation to lead as it should be. AI's can drag you into wars you dont want to be in but you can't vice versa. Soon enough empires have all joined into either alliances or federations resulting in a whole lot of nothing, other than the occasional glitch infested wars that happen occaisonally.Then finally we hit endgame where you have most of the techs in the game. ONE of the endgame disasters in which other dimensional beings invade the galaxy which turns politics on its head which is intersting BUT AI refuse to fight back making it the player VS. galactic wide threat which guess what your rewards are for destroying the disaster? 40+ with every empire and you loose 5 of said 40 every one year, to give an example of how little that is an embassy goes up to +100. You destroy a galactic wide threat and get less influence than an embassy. Not only that but the territory they took does not receed at all making a permenant scar on the universe thats not supposed to happen.I really wanted to love this game but I can't and if it takes DLC that I have to purchase from paradox to fix it, then I never will.

												So I'm 8 hours into this and here are some unsolicited thoughts from someone who's played Paradox games for like thirteen years now:Game is fantastic.That isn't to say it's without its downsides right now -- barring a few bugs and balance issues that are pending (namely, slavery) -- its biggest shortcoming is the lack of depth in diplomacy (which I fully expect to be the first expansion). The midgame does, as IGN pointed out in their review, turn into a pretty massive grind in single-player, especially if you're in an area of space with not a lot of friendlies surrounding you. In multiplayer I imagine this is ten thousand times better just by virtue of the fact that player diplomancy is happening, but yeah.In spite of that though, the game is really astounding, and I'm pleasantly shocked that Paradox launched a game this smoothly. The game concepts absolutely hit the nail on the head. Exploration is fantastic, POP management is cool, the characters are cool (though they could be fleshed out a bit more too), the favor of the races is really fantastic, and ship design is engaging for the theorycrafters. I've found myself making an actual fleet doctrine in this game, and it's been working out.Overall this is going to be a game, like the rest of the Paradox line, that I play for hundreds of hours.My biggest gripe from my current game though: when vassalizing an empire in a war, I REALLY REALLY wish it would automatically switch that empire's government over to your ethos. I'm not talking about all the POPs, I mean the government itself. It's impossible for this vassal empire to have a positive opinion of me because their ethos is diametrically opposed to mine... you would think that the process of vassalization would involve installing a puppet government of your own choosing.

												I wasn't really sure about buying this game.  It seemed like a lot.  But, now that I have, I realize that it was well worth what I paid for it.  When you first start, it can be kind of daunting, as there is a lot going on.  You do get used to it.  There are a lot of options to adjust to create different gameplay every time.  It's a very rewarding experience, and if you are unsure about purchasing this, you really should.			"

												I'm writing this before 1.3.Stellaris is a very complex space 4X. i was captivated from the first day and have spent a lot of time till I got the feel of it. That dowsn't mean that time was wasted, though, I really enjoyed those early parts, but I do things differently now when I start a new game. The game is real time with a pause option.While there is the possibility to auto imize parts you don't want to do, the AI for this isn't the best, so you have to find your own way here.Pros:- player races can either be predefined, random or configured. So you aren't stuck with the designers' ideas like in some games.- there is no techtree to follow, you can chose between random technologies in three fields. The choice of alternatives is influenced by your current tech level. The most important tech, the colony ship, is always a starting choice.- lots of background (event-chains, anomalies, space monsters, special systems)- the game is easily moddable and has lots of active modders.- a playable diplomacy systemCons:- the random factor at game start is too big. You start with 5 randomm leaders and some time they are just crap and replacing a leader costs 50 influence. There are several mods out there to balance this, though.- as the game is real time, it is hard to keep track if you have several battles at once. You can only watch one of them.- The game stops if an event pops up and starts again once you close the event window. Some events  however don't stop the game and it can be quite confusing if several popups open at the same time.- auto created ship are just crap, you have to do this on your own to be competitive.- once combat starts you cannot fly away even if neither side is within firing range of the other yet.- some events are really hard.So get youself the game, get some popular mod collection and have fun.As 1.3 is just coming out, it might take a while till all modders made necessary xgnges to their mods, though.

												I have really enjoyed Stellaris.  Building an empire, researching technology, and fending off some sort of large, galactic-threatening event is a ton of fun.  I've been impressed with the depth of the tactical and research options, and colonization has also been fairly interesting.  I do have a hard time continuing to play post-uber threat, but everything up to that point is absolutely fantastic.  Additionally, I've been very pleased with their release of several large patches that are attempting to patch issues with the game, including completely rebalancing several areas with ship combat, and also adding in a fair amount of content for free.  I've not had a chance to play the new DLC, but the amount of content in it looks impressive.If you like Grand Strategy and 4X, I would recommend you give this a shot.  If 4x/Grand Strategy is too long for you, go ahead and give it a pass, because these games will carry on for a long time.			"

												I don't know how else to explain that this is a grand strategy game that takes a lot of the best parts of Paradox strategy games. It scratches that itch of controlling and building a budding empire. It isn't an easy or strict game persay either. More to say that it doesn't hold your hand beyond explaining what the menus do and drops you to figure out what you need to do with your empire.I am two hours into my first playthrough starting with the tutorial. I feel elated to be taking humanity to the stars but there is so much adversity that every challenge however minor feels like triumph.I will admit that I have not explored this game fully so I can't give it a full score but I would at the very least label this game a 8/10 if not 9/10 with opinions pending.Subjectively though, 10/10 because I got to swarm a pathetic pirate outpost with three fleets.

												Stellaris is a pretty neat Grand RTS 4x game. It has a lot of nods to other sci-fi universes like halo, star trek, and even a little bit of star wars. I found it to have a bit of a learning curve but that might just be me due to the fact that I have not played many strategy games of late other than SW Empire at war.I would say my biggest issue with this game is that it gets to a standstill really quickly. There will come a point where no other empire can really touch you and taking them over isn't really a challenge. Some pretty neat events can happen but unless you let it grow, the events dont really do much. What I am saying is that it lacks end game content. Mid game is kinda meh.   Other than that, the game play is generally pretty fun. Making your own empire, colonizing ring worlds, becoming the ultimate power, enslaving your friends because they are helpless against you, and simply going to war is fun... unless your on the losing side then you get to watch your empire crumble down around you. There's a lot of neat things you can do in the game and its also very easy to be destroyed. Overall, this game is highly addicting and fun but it needs more end game events to give our huge empires something to worry about. I recommend giveing it a try if your looking for a new 4x grand strategy game. Oh and this game supports mods like many others. You can change things about it. For example, you can have more colors to customize your empire with! I saw another one where you can build ring worlds and I hope the author to that one keeps updating it because it sounds fun.			"

												First off, the process of making your actual empire or choosing from one of the pre-made ones is in of itself and incredibly satisfying experience. Instead of relegating you to predertimed stats for each 'species' or portrait, the game allows you to determine what your species is actually capable of.Nataurally I made my glorious starship-troopers ripoff federation, this time maade up of actual alien apes. Within seconds you are greeted by your AI instructor who gives you a greeting based upon your government type, asking for what level of assistance you would like proferred. Immediately I noticed the quest system, and before this I had a history of disliking games with quest sytems but.....This quest system WORKS. It doesn't feel scripted or intrusive, and I feel that it actually increases the level of immersion. In your typical sci-fi strategy, the whole RP or national crises that would arise were often cold logical wars over predetermined resources, with a very artificial feel.In Stellaris, the quests feel as though they are things that aren't just shoved in your face for a tutorial or credits, they are as much a part of the lore of your playthrough as anything. For example, my military republic ape people got a quest where they had to retrieve old sub-light sattelites before the dirty xenos got them. I won't spoil it, but the questline is MUCH more complex than you might be led to believe by the initial prompt.In other words, You can practically have your own in-depth space opera, and with modding, have it feature any species you could dream of.

												Fun game.- Some bugs in it. But those will adress later i`m sure of it. - No need to cheat. Its simple and easy to manage. - Learning the game take up to 1 hour at most rest is easy to do. - Combat is simple and some tactics in fitting (you are a empire builder not a combat pilot) so do not buy it for that. - up to 39 AI and some extra`s (spoilers) - achivements only in ironman. And thats is how it needs to be in everygame.- Bonus stuff and easter eggs (give you some good laughs about it)- Mini campaigne in it (events you can follow or just ignore) - Great map 1000 stars and you know in every star there are planets you can discover or settel down)- Game takes more then 20 hours to even get out of early stage at 1000 stars map. - No borring waiting. Like civ or most RTS games.- Random decks (research are decks stage so every game is a little diffrend for you even if you play the same race)- plenty of options to costum your race or edit your ship in every way you want however colouring your ship is not in this version perhaps a DLC? - Voice tut always fun to lissen even he change some text depend on your empire picking- Lovely graphics just simple clean and how it needs to be. (Do not pre-order any game unless you`re sure the game is worth to pay for)A SIDE NOTE--------------Do not make this game a real as possible because its all wrong. Do not compare this game with reality! SPECIAL NOTE---------------Game bug (stuttering fix in 1 day) So ignore all reviews with that there are outdate. Also people with less then 10 hours in this game and having a negative or possitive review ignore it.And people with 1000+ hours also mostly because of the fake / cheat program the have use to do that. Also ignore IGN review there are COD fans we know it the know it. Or some one is high up there when he wrote that.			"

												UPDATE: After several patches and developer diaries from Paradox I feel this game is just getting better. If you played this on release and found it a little lacking, it is well worth coming back and having another go now, and same thing in a few months time after the next two patches. This game does have a few things that Paradox needs to work on, and I think they knew this before it was released. Problems with diplomacy, mid game content, and how some features work prevent this game from being a smash hit straight out of the box.That being said, I've played almost nothing else since it was released, and it's smashed all sale records for Paradox, which is usually used to niche titles released for niche audiences.On the one hand I wish I had seen the game with the fixes and extra features they are adding over the next few months, on the other hand I'd have been severely annoyed if this game was delayed, so they can't win.Overall if you're into sci-fi and you're into strategy this will be a perfect game for you, and if you've always liked the sound of Paradox's games but felt CKII or EUIV weren't accessible enough, this is their most accessible game yet.

												Basically, Civillization V's hot one night stand with Spore's Space Age. Great combo of strategy and RTS as well as the 4x's of Empire building.(Explore, Exploit, Expand, Exterminate)Pros:-Awesome race and empire creation-Cool RP community-Neat space combat AI and different interstellar travel and mechanics.-Immersive strategy, diplomatic placements and choice in allies can save or break your empire.-Cool ship customization and research progression, you feel like you're bettering an interstellar empire through your work. Cons:-The AI can suffer from Civ V syndrome, they won't budge in resource trade deals. Ever.-Moderate learning curve (Not so much a con as a warning, you will get crushed in online games.)-Slavery is OP (not even kidding, it's broken and very exploitative for aggressive empires)-Slightly flimsy diplomacy, usually results in ""I'll buy your love with credits, now let's be friends k?""In summary, amazing 4x sci-fi strategy with a solid online community, would highly recommend.

It's very confusing at first even with the tutorial, but once you get an understanding of the game, it becomes a blast as you control a gigantic galaxy wide empire. Definitely recommend if you love strategy games.			"

												This game oh man, 1st of all I recommend this game completely,  even tho I will have some negative aspects to tell,The graphics are very nice, the system of organization too, they should ad more like diversity in the characters, and some background, after a time they all look the same, exploring is some of the best things but in mid to late game there are not much maybe missions on planets or solar systems, there are also a lack of very good ideas like spies or pirates, umm corsaries something like that, more history, im plannig a mod for news maybe, thats somehting I miss, like a newspaper, the region thing I dont like it still, you can not order individual production on your port stations, I have benefits in the stations, planets dont mine the evolution chart of buldings but I do mind that planets dont have better resolution that you actually see the rotation and a google like map you can se tiny buldings of the cities or landing, maybe a mod, overall the game is beutiful the music is blad runner like most ""dope"" .said a newyorker once. the music 10 the alien species are cool, some of the wich you will hate and try to destroy, until they partner with stronger allies like little ♥♥♥♥♥es, hell even once a captain of a reserch ship try to fool me, my order was investigate a planet, were suposedly were an alien species, the orders were clear, investigate, the next thing I know is the planet were destroy by a probe, .a probe, -how the ♥♥♥♥ are you gonna destroy a planet with a probe, how the f.. b. fired inmediately, things like that details 10/10			"

												I have really enjoyed Stellaris.  Building an empire, researching technology, and fending off some sort of large, galactic-threatening event is a ton of fun.  I've been impressed with the depth of the tactical and research options, and colonization has also been fairly interesting.  I do have a hard time continuing to play post-uber threat, but everything up to that point is absolutely fantastic.  Additionally, I've been very pleased with their release of several large patches that are attempting to patch issues with the game, including completely rebalancing several areas with ship combat, and also adding in a fair amount of content for free.  I've not had a chance to play the new DLC, but the amount of content in it looks impressive.If you like Grand Strategy and 4X, I would recommend you give this a shot.  If 4x/Grand Strategy is too long for you, go ahead and give it a pass, because these games will carry on for a long time.			"

												I'm writing this before 1.3.Stellaris is a very complex space 4X. i was captivated from the first day and have spent a lot of time till I got the feel of it. That dowsn't mean that time was wasted, though, I really enjoyed those early parts, but I do things differently now when I start a new game. The game is real time with a pause option.While there is the possibility to auto imize parts you don't want to do, the AI for this isn't the best, so you have to find your own way here.Pros:- player races can either be predefined, random or configured. So you aren't stuck with the designers' ideas like in some games.- there is no techtree to follow, you can chose between random technologies in three fields. The choice of alternatives is influenced by your current tech level. The most important tech, the colony ship, is always a starting choice.- lots of background (event-chains, anomalies, space monsters, special systems)- the game is easily moddable and has lots of active modders.- a playable diplomacy systemCons:- the random factor at game start is too big. You start with 5 randomm leaders and some time they are just crap and replacing a leader costs 50 influence. There are several mods out there to balance this, though.- as the game is real time, it is hard to keep track if you have several battles at once. You can only watch one of them.- The game stops if an event pops up and starts again once you close the event window. Some events  however don't stop the game and it can be quite confusing if several popups open at the same time.- auto created ship are just crap, you have to do this on your own to be competitive.- once combat starts you cannot fly away even if neither side is within firing range of the other yet.- some events are really hard.So get youself the game, get some popular mod collection and have fun.As 1.3 is just coming out, it might take a while till all modders made necessary xgnges to their mods, though.

Ya its not chock full of stuff, for the most part you just explore and colonize planets till you find someone, then proceed to crush them like ants just as you would in eu iv (natives) or ck II (Independent Counts). its the same formula as every other great paradox game but with the added awesomness of space!

												Stellaris manages to capture the feeling of standing on a hill outside the city lights at night, staring up into the sky and wondering what's out there. I did not expect this from a realtime strategy game.Basically, Stellaris is a lightweight mix of Europa Universalis and Crusader Kings in space with a heady note of Galactiv Civilizations. It's the most accessible of all Paradox strategy games, but this isn't a bad thing by far. There's still plenty of options how to create and run your stellar empire, democracy or military junta. Empires have genuine personalities mapped to them, and you never know what's waiting out there for you.The most recent DLC is hilarious, at least if you - like me - consider a poor lonely Scientist vessel in the depths of space being ripped apart by madness when encountering a planetsized tentacled horror to be funny.Stellaris is wonderful escapism and manages to spellbind you if you let it.

What I enjoy a lot so far:- Great Game Mechanics for interacting with other species, spacefaring or sentient.- Pleasant UI- Immersion is definitely enabled.- Insanely stable so far (especially for a Paradox game on release date)What I like less so far:- Slow progress during the first few hours, even in relativity to other space strategy games - probably just me being unable to manage my decadent xenophobe collectivist bird empire.Already looking forward to mod releases!

												If you've already played and enjoyed other grand strategy titles such as EU4, CK2, Victoria and etc., I see no reason why you wouldn't enjoy this game. As for other people who are looking to get into grand strategy titles and you already like 4X in space games such as Endless Space, Master of Orion, this is a must buy as well.That being said, I would like to point outa few things if you are still considering buying the game. As with many other Paradox strategy games, the game is fun but you do start to feel the roughness around the edges around 10 hours into the game. And as usual, this game will probably be much, much better after some of the inevitable expansions to it.I estimate that I will get at least a good 60 - 80 hours of fun from the game before I take a break and wait for further content to be availabe in the game.

												Studio known for it's historical grand strategy games decides to shake up the 4X-genre. Release is surprisingly smooth, a lot of content is left out or is just too shallow to be interesting (such as diplomacy and internal politics) which makes mid game and especially late game repetitive and quite bland. There aren't really much interaction between game mechanics and with previously mentioned issues, this stomps emergent storytelling - which in my opinion is the best spice in Paradox GSG games. Every now and then Stellaris feels like it's from different developer, but smooth and logical gameplay remind the game is crafted by Paradox with love. Looking past the disappointment, Stellaris is filled with creativity and great ideas and it's early game is most refreshing 4X in years. While mid and late parts of the game feel sloppy, they have their unexplainable charm. Stellaris should've been named: ""Sci-fi Tropes: The Game"".Freedom in creating your own species and empires is astounding and gives huge replayability. There is difference if you're playing xenophile, pacifist birds or if you're on a militaristic crusade through the galaxy. The game even properly manages to handle multispecies Empires. Stellaris has a sturdy foundation for Paradox to build a classic, a new milestone for the space 4X-genre. Paradox has already published their plans with next upcoming patches, which will (hopefully) flesh out the game. On basis of their plans and current state of the game, Stellaris was released a few months too early. + Engaging early game, exploration and expanding+ Audiovisually best 4X there is (soundtrack is superb)+ Mods only not supported, but encouraged+ Innovative, stands out in a stale genre of space opera strategy games+ Really a lot of customization+ Flawless multiplayer- Diplomacy is simple, boring and almost useless- Internal politics are nominally there, population system is just a faded shadow of Victoria II's one- No trade mechanics, resources are almost meaningless- Wars are tedious.- Not really a lot of ways to interact with other empires. At the moment (1.0.3 version) my score: 72/100. For me it was worth the money, but wouldn't recommend it unconditionally. Would suggest to wait for first bigger updates ""Asimov"" and ""Heinlein"".EDIT: Props for making me use spreadsheets and notepad when playing.			"

												Game is unfinished. By that i dont just mean multitude of bugs, some of which are game-braking, but also full of half-baked, unthought-trough, placeholder features that certainly didnt go trough any User Experience departments.Like the ship designer for example:Its just a gimmick that gives the illusion you can design own ships and play the game with them. Well, you can deisgn them, but after each research (which finishes quickly) you would need to manually play with the numbers again and again and again to keep the ship up to date and able to fight enemies. Other option is full auto-best feature, which keeps the deisngs up to date itself, and you just click ""upgrade"" on your fleets after all new research completes. That basically removes the ship designer from the game, and turns your options while building ships and forming fleets into... 4 ship sizes. The only playable way to play the game. There is no way to influence the role of your ships, their designs, you either go full auto, or full manuall - both are dull and uninteresting. On top of that, if you are die-hard hardcore who want to manually upgrade ships each time you research new technology, or if you are trying to go middle-way, keeping core of your fleets ""auto-best"" to have optimal stats and adding to your fleets single, specialised ships like the support, shield-aura providing class, you will encounter a bug while upgrading fleet, that will turn all your core, auto-best battleships, into low dps aura providers... Making the fleet broken and useless. Only way to fix the results of the bug, would be to - guess what! - remove the class from designer and stop using designer whatsoever :) Here is the screenshot of my fleet upgrading into support class from different class (woudlnt be a problem, if you could switch classes of already built ships, but of course that is not ipmlemented).http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/259338860000669245/9103F8D5D0CF2B4C196E2F0843E2C3E5AAB26DEE/I dont know what were they thinking while making this feature. I can only guess it was to lie about how cool the game is. Its Europe Universalis watered down and simplified into uninteresting bug-ridden waste of time.			"

												Stellaris manages to capture the feeling of standing on a hill outside the city lights at night, staring up into the sky and wondering what's out there. I did not expect this from a realtime strategy game.Basically, Stellaris is a lightweight mix of Europa Universalis and Crusader Kings in space with a heady note of Galactiv Civilizations. It's the most accessible of all Paradox strategy games, but this isn't a bad thing by far. There's still plenty of options how to create and run your stellar empire, democracy or military junta. Empires have genuine personalities mapped to them, and you never know what's waiting out there for you.The most recent DLC is hilarious, at least if you - like me - consider a poor lonely Scientist vessel in the depths of space being ripped apart by madness when encountering a planetsized tentacled horror to be funny.Stellaris is wonderful escapism and manages to spellbind you if you let it.

												40 hours played while having fun at the cost of 40 Euro. Recommended. As a standalone 4X in space, the game is inventive and enjoyable. However, Stellaris is not on par with other Paradox titles and I am quite disappointed. My main complaints are the UI and AI.Paradox is a studio that knows how to create a good UI. How could they create this mess? It looks fine at first glance, but once you've sunk your teeth into the game mechanics, you'll notice how you have to hop in the menu between different screens to get info you need. Simple stuff like splitting off damaged ships from your fleet, that has been in Europa Universalis IV for years, is lacking. Instead, you have to manually split the fleet one ship at a time - and even that in a very poor design. Even the map gives inferior information - oftenly, anamolies will simply not show up on the galaxy map if you don't research them instantly (and you'll have to check system by system to find where you left it) and sometimes it doesn't even show where there are habitable worlds. I smell a big patch coming to fix all that.The difficulty, in at least the first 15 or so hours, of the game is simply resource management. It is brilliant, you really need to strategize to increase your output while at the same time being able to colonize. There are also some scripted events and random encouters that'll force you to build a few warships. So while this is a nice phase of the game, the AI is rather passive. Some will declare you a rival or try to make deals, some will make demands, but they will NOT challenge you at all. Which is a pity. I suspect that there will be a DLC or two to cover the grey zone between rival status and war. That seems to be Paradox's way of fixing things.A lot of people complain about the sectors. I think it's an okay solution to the management nightmare any 4X/grand strat becomes when you have a large empire. My complaint here is the AI, and that there is no way to send resources to your sector to allow it to grow (unless it's hidden somewhere in the backend of the UI). It just can't handle difficult situations with sparse resources. You really need to micromanage and grow your colony before you hand it over to the AI. Which is contraproductive to the whole point of having sectors. It's a shame to call for a patch for something that should have been working from the start.I have also read a lot of complaints about wars ending automaticly. This is just a different feature from what you might be used to. Once you have set your wargoals, you will automaticly sign a peace when you can afford them all (and the AI is beaten). If you didn't set any wargoals, you'll get a white peace because you can't add them at the end of the war.Diplomacy, and the AI for the different factions, is on Paradox level. It might at times fell a bit bare-boned, but it is infinitely better than most other games. You will actually be able to deduct how different factions will behave (Gandhi will not nuke the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you with 50 turns to go) and can adapt to face the potential threats to your empire. If someone hates your slavery policy so much it risks a war, you can change it (with a possible hit to your happiness). I'd personally prefer a bit more fluff around the diplomacy. If you have two hostile empires at your borders, you can count on them ganging up on you somehow.The pacing of the game is very slow, even by grand strat and Paradox standards. Researching something takes years, and even at full speed that will take some time. Resources tick in on a monthly basis instead of trickling in all the time.There are other good features (research tree, race designer, you can investigate enemy shipwrecks after battles) and bad features (poor variety of interaction with primitives, no variety to deal with tile blockers, you have to build lvl 1 building and then click upgrade to lvl 2 and then click upgrade to lvl 3) but overall it's a good, albeit slow, 4X. I expect the UI to be fixed eventually, and with more events/less downtime where your only challenge is resource management, this would be an awesome game.			"

												I like Stellaris a lot. But like most games, it has some flaws. I will briefly talk about a few aspects which might help potential buyers decide.DepthCompared with other real-time strategy games (the most complex game i have played before is the anno series), Stellaris is quite complicated. The tutorial text boxes do a good job of getting you into the game quickly without having to read too much explanation at a time. Some mechanics, however, are never explained at all and you might only find out about them after many hours of play. That did not keep me from having fun during those hours of ignorance though.ReplayabilityEvery game i have played so far was vastly different. There are countless different strategies you can use and all of those can lead you to victory if you play right. But the semi-random science progression, the quests and events, the ethics drift of your population and the AI-Empires will make sure you are facing different challenges, even if you try a similar playstyle twice. When i was trying to focus my empire on synthetics (robot populations with artificial intelligence) i expanded right into a fallen empire which did not like AI-related research at all. This forced me to go a different route, lest i be crushed by their ridiculously advanced military.InterfaceConsidering everything you can do, and all the information you might want to view in this game, the interface is alright. it is, however, far from perfect or even good. There is always a way to find what you are looking for, but it gets quite tedious at times. Say you want to start a nice slave colony on that jungle world you just discoverd. Good look finding those tropical-preference-fanatic-collectivist-mushroom-folk which migrated over from the empire next door a decade ago.CombatDon't expect tactical combat. The game has depth when it comes to customizing your ships, composing your fleets, chosing commanders. These decisions can make the difference between a devastating loss and an easy win, without spending more on your army. However, once a battle starts, all you do is watch.MultiplayerMultiplayer with friends works great. Public games are more problematic. There are not too many people playing public games online, so it takes quite some time to fill up a game. Since a full game of Stellaris takes many hours, lots of players will leave for one reason or the other.PresentationThe main part of the stories emerging in this game takes place in your head. The game itself mostly presents you statistics, descriptive texts, still images and maybe a space battle here and there. For me personally these stories are still more compelling than the narrative of most triple A games, because they are mine and they are always unpredictable.			"

												One of the most awsome games I have ever played. It was suggested to me by my friends, first I didnt want to buy it but then I decided I will try it at least the worst thing what could happen is a refund. This game is so complex you have got a choice at almost anything. When I made my first empire I didnt really knew what I was doing so I made a race which cannot live without war. Only when my fleet made first contact with the enemy fleet I realized I was so primitive compared to other races like I was trying to throw rocks at them when they had plasma launchers, because I didnt focus on research at all. Right now I play with an empire that is focused on slaving other races and mass murdering anybody who doesent agree with me. srsly love this game.			"

												If you expect this to be like any ealier Paradox Real time Grand Strategy game, it is not.The best way I can describe it is:They took a realtime, space 4x game and added in ideas from all thier previous Real Time Grand Strategy games to limit micromanagement and curbstomping mid- to lategame. The result is surprisingly well working even for multiplayer in a huge galaxy.As natural for such a recent release and a Paradox game in particular, not all of the mechanics are yet in place and DLC are sure to follow soon-ish. For example the only way to win is via war right now.Clarke has been out by now for some time, fixing some of the biggest release issues.The 2nd great patch (Asimov) is being worked on, wich will change Diplomacy and non-warfare play once again.

												Great foundation for the future and one of the most unique and robust space strategy games out there - However, at this moments it's still relatively unpolished, buggy and surprisingly empty.And did this game really need to be this ugly?... I can only wish for a Stellaris sequel that would look like Master of Orion or Endless Space 2.Still, the game is totaly worth the money, especialy with the amount of content it will surely get. However, if you want a more complete package, better purchase the game in a few months with a handful of DLCs.			"

												For the price of $39.99 this is a solid addition to any 4X Space Strategy Game Lover's library. It has a lot of content, and definitely is a lot harder than most games in this genre. The technology cards are a little random, and I do hate RNG, but they seem to generally be fair. There is a solid base for diplomacy and war in this game, you can do both and succeed with both. The actual battles lack many tactical options, this is a grand strategy game made by Paradox of course, not a RTS made by Sega. What there lacks in strategic options during the battles and such, is more than made up for by the in depth options before and after said battles. I am specifically referring to battles in the first section below, and will be going over the strategy layer after that.First of all, when you first load up the game you will be able to choose or create your own custom empire. If you do create a custom empire, I recommend creating your own name for the empire, and the homeworld, as otherwise there is a good chance you will run into someone with the same named system, and that kinda breaks immersion. On to the options in regards to warfare, you will find many different options located here. Known as traits, you tailor your species in regards to your playstyle. If you are planning on playing a smart techy race, you will want to go with Intelligence, Engineering Focus, and the like. You can also pick a race that is primed for direct warfare, such as planetary battles. There are two I have in mind for planetary invasions, Strong and Sturdy, both of which provide bonuses to combat, and in the case of strong (and very strong) you will gain a bonus to mineral income, which is useful as well.There are two main kinds of combat, Planetary Combat, and Space Combat. Planetary combat is done with Armies, which are created on planets, travel on transports (in the case of assault armies), and invade other worlds. Ships may also bombard the planet below in order to reduce the enemy's fortifications, which directly increases your damage dealt to them when you land your soldiers.The other kind of combat is space combat, this is where most people will focus their time and effort in regards to upgrading and maintaining a powerful fleet. You will generally need a powerful standing fleet in order to defend yourselves, and will have to properly allocate enough resources to do so. Ships take a long time to build, and are costly as well, so if they are damaged I would recommend you create a new fleet with the most damaged ships and send them back for repairs. It is also cheap to upgrade ships, so if you find a new design you like better than your current one, delete the old design(s), and all other designs of the same class, so that you may upgrade your fleet.As for the diplomacy in regards to war, there are objectives you may set that you desire to gain from the war, and the enemy will fight you or cede them to you as they see fit. Diplomacy is rather engrossing and it can take a long time to properly learn and navigate all of the fields. You will sometimes find yourself in an Alliance and attempting to grow it, only to realize that the universe has split up much like Europe, into many different and opposing Alliances. Trade is fair, and if you hover over the red text (when trying to find out why they don't want to do something), it will generally give you the knowledge you were searching for.All in all the game is solid in music, the graphics are well done, the game rarely lags, and I have only encountered a few bugs. The matches last for a really,  really, really long time. And there is almost always something new and interesting that you can do!9/10Con: The mid game can be a bit boring at times.Edit:The more you play the game the better you will be at using the diplomacy system to improve relations with fellow spacefarers, and the better you will be at waging war. War is important as it allows you to keep your opponents in check, and to gradually expand outwards, without expending the resources needed to form a colony ship. Over time your ship designs will become far more efficient, and you will be able to play to a much farther level than you originally though possible. I formed an Alliance early on into the game with one of two rivals, took out the other, and together we have beaten another Empire that was as big as ours put together, I took one of their Allies as a hostage, and then have proceeded to decimate that Empire into submission, with them now being at the last ropes, completely unable to protect themselves or rebuild. Another massive empire took over a rival I had backed, and we have went to war with them, taking their homeworld from them. This doesn't seem that important, until you realize the political, and economical significance of a homeworld. It is far from my most valuable world, but it was theirs. I waited until they had deployed their fleets attempting to conquer another Empire that was a bit away, and essentially terrorist bombed all of their spaceports and planets until they gave me their world. Soon after I went to war with the other Empire, the one I had signed a temporary peace with in the past, and conquered their homeworld as well, took their ally that I had vassalized, and gave them another world, thereby gaining their complete loyalty, indirectly increasing my strength, directly increasing my strength through conquest, and ultimately weakening another foe. These are the kinds of decisions I am talking about that you learn over time, and compared to the first wars I fought on my first playthroughs, this is a very important lesson to learn.So in summation, you will get better at this game over time, and as you play it more you will find that you can do a lot more than you initially though, that there are a lot of varied and important strategies to learn, and that this game is a lot of fun. :)			"

												Hello Everyone! After playing for quite a bit of time, I can effectively write a thorough review of Stellaris.Stellaris is a great game in general with some flaws that can be fixed to improve the gameplay.Lets start by going over the PROS/CONS====================================================================================PROS:-Perfect Europa Style Sci-fi Society game (In my Opinion)-Stunning Graphics-Numerous amounts of Technologies-Perfect to kill time-Many game mechanics to learn/discover-Nice Micromanagement mechanics-Extremely fun with friends====================================================================================CONS:-Repititive and Bland Mid-Game (All you in Mid Game is Research,Colonize,Micromanage, and Build up your fleet)-Only one thing left to do late game *Become Hitler* -Diplomacy is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (The ""Threat' Level, ARE YOU SERIOUS?! Just after taking ONE PLANET goes up to 500?!) Ok then-Sector AI (OOOOOOOOOOO I HATE THE SECTOR AI SOOO F****** MUCH!)-""End Game Crisis"" (Kiss my F******* A** End Game Crisis, that♥♥♥♥♥♥aint even a worth my time, not even a challenge)-Listen closely, ya listening? Ok,good....I DO NOT WANT TO COMPLETE THE MONUMENTAL TASK OF CONQUERING EVERY OTHER ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ EMPIRE! (Late game sucks btw, thats all you can really do)-OP ASF Strategies (Ex: Corvette Swarm, Tachyon Lances, Tachyon Lances, oh and did I mention TACHYON LANCES?)====================================================================================Some things I want for the future:-New FTL Megastructures (Ex: Warp Conduit,Slipstream Generator,Portal network module)I'll explain these later ._.In conclusion, Stellaris is a great at first, but gets repetitive as you play is more. Why do I have more than 100 Hours? Im patient....with no life....and no friends......ANYWAYS! I still think Stellaris is still a good game and can be improved if these flaws are fixed! :3peace ♥♥♥♥♥es "

												After originally watching this game pre-release, I was a bit skeptical about the actual enjoyment of the game. However, after purchasing the game and playing for a few hours, I fell in love. The game allows you to play to the exact way you feel it should, each playstyle being completely different. Do you want to be a totalitarian ruler and inslave all your people, or thrive in a materialist world of democracy, or even rule by divine right, and colonize all the planets you can like in the times of the crusades? Well, with this game, anything you want to do is possible. Just imagine Star Trek but you as the head of the federation.			"

												Empire building and sci-fi themed games have always been a favorite of mine and Stellaris is no different. While I personally belive that this game has numerous flaws I still think that it has the potential to be a classic. I feel like people are quick to♥♥♥♥♥♥on this game because it isn't perfect and most of it's critisism is both unwarrented and undeserved.Pros+Wide array of colorful and original alien races+Beautiful graphics and ship/station design +Supports mods+More than one mode of FTL travel +Numerous military aspectsCons-I have to hoard my influence so I can replace all my scientists when they die at the same time-Diplomacy and trade is lacking, I often have no idea how to please an AI empire -AI is lacking-The sector system needs to be removed, most of the time I have unemployed pops and with t1 buildings despite being late game because I recieve a resource penalty if I have more than 5 planets.

												A great space strategy game, one of the bests. The music and atmosphere are great and The game runs very smooth. It really gives you a feeling of running an interstellar empire with gameplay that includes managing the ethos and expectations of your subjects, administrative sectors and more. There is always something interesting to do, with random events, planet development, empire management and ongoing politics.Like any Paradox title, give it time to fully flesh out with more content that will come later down the road. I am sure paradox will support this game for years to come. Just like Europa Universalis 4Must have for all gamers who like smart 4X games and Paradox strategies.			"

												I like it.It's actually a great game for people like me, who enjoy 4X's but suffer with information overloads. Instead of giving you all the info upfront and telling you to make a choice on where to go, it just dribbles it out via a random tech selection. Many of the more advanced mechanics are revealed later into the game, and the impact of your choices when starting emerge slowly as well. Might take a few resets, but eventually you can get a handle on all of the features without a fear of min/maxing or getting overwhelmed.There is still a lot of room for improvement, such as in the faction system and the war demands (I'm a war monger, I like to be able to control people indirectly with fear), as well as some glaring bugs that need fixing.Overall, I would recommend it. Maybe not now, but in a little while when the price drops a bit and the issues are sorted out.			"

												Dont get me wrong , I really enjoyed this game. i have more than 30 hours in it ( offline ) . However it's not done yet in a lot of aspects. Ofcourse we are not talking about a ****y cash grabbing company. This is paradox and i have complete faith that in a year and with some dlcs this game will become really awesome. The only thing is while paradox loves to add a lot of more features and stuff to their games via dlcs, they are not cheap. Ofcourse i knew this game was gonna be like the rest of their game when i saw the price tag. To the Devs : This game is seriously lacking in politics and espionage right now . what made crusader kings so freakin great was the conspiracies and the plots. and the random events that happened every now and then, preventing the game to become stale.All in all, This game is so close to be perfect, but just not yet.

Posted: May 23, 2016
												[Note: Changed my review after playing some more].TL;DR: Good, not great yet. Somewhat shallow on many fronts, and late game is so tedious it is practically unbearable. May get ironed out with later patches.I give it a 6/10 until they can fix the late game. If they do that, 7/10. Add in more victory conditions and diplomacy/spying, and you get get a 8 or 9/10.-- Full Review --Good game. Not perfect, though. It runs in real-time, so it is more akin to Sins of a Solar Empire. However, it is much deeper than that game.It is a lot like MOO2 in character. Start with a pre-designed or custom-built race and try to conquer the galaxy with them. However, this game does a much better job of simulating actual empire management. As your empire grows, your people can split into various factions, and you need to keep them happy or they may rebel and form their own empire. Also, their is a small limit on the number of planets you can manage manually. The others have to be assigned to a 'sector', which is essentially an AI-managed group of planets. This is a great mechanic, because it takes the tedium out of the late game, something that other games have struggled with.When creating a custom race, you choose the species (mammal, bird, fungus, etc..) which doesn't affect anything but appearance. Then you choose the home planet type and ethos, which is kind of like your race's philosophy. Ethos affects a lof of things in the game, and so is very important. Thankfully all of the choices seem pretty well balanced. You can then choose a government type, which is limited by your ethos. Finally, you can choose traits, which give you bonuses or penalties, using a point system. While the traits you can choose are much more limited than MOO2, the combination of traits, ethos, and government makes a wide variety of races possible.Research is handled similar to MOO 1, in that you are given a selection of techs to choose from for research. Ones you don't choose may or may not show up later. (Usually they will, but you may have to wait for a while to see them.) Also, there are rare techs which you might be lucky enough to come up for research. There are also techs which can only be obtained by killing enemies and researching the debris, similar to MOO2.The game features not only enemy empires, but primitive (i.e. pre-space flight) races that you can study, exploit, or uplift, and fallen empires, which are high-tech empires that have passed their prime and are not rotting from the inside. (Similar to MOO2's Antareans.)There is a quest system that is called 'Special Projects' that requires you to do certain things in order to receive a reward. Usually it's just moving a science vessel to a particular planet and doing some research, but there are other more complicated (and interesting) project, such as investigating a precursor race.The systems all seem to be fairly well balanced, and the game never seems to bog down with nothing to do. There's always another star to survey, another planet to build up, or another enemy to fight.Good Things:- Race customization- Huge maps- Neat faction system with ethical divergence- Combat doesn't bog down in late game.Bad Things:- The only way to win seems to be militarily. You have to every other race in the game either allied, wiped out, or as a vassal in order to win. This is a HUGE pain in the rear in the late game, when you control 3/4 of the map, yet you still have to conquer other empires a few planets at a time because of the limits of the war goals system. (You can't just up and conquer a planet. You have to set war goals, and then fight your opponent until he gives in.)- Some more information screens would help, such as a fleet manager to show you all of your ships, or a planet manager to show all of your planets. There is an overview control that does a fair job of this, but ships that you create in a sector (AI-controlled) don't show up, even when you are in control of them. This happens a lot later in the game as you use these sectors to build colony ships.- Sector AI doesn't seem to colonize new planets in the sector. Having to do this yourself is tedious.- The traits, ethos, and government type seem to give very small bonuses and penalties. This was probably done for balancing purposes, but it seems like they should have more of an impact. Example: A repulsive race only gets a 5% penalty to race relations.- No spying, and diplomacy is functional, but not great.- Game performance is terrible in the late game. I have actually quit playing until this is resolved.- Still lots of bugs. (Bronze age civilization with space stations? Really?)So, this is a good game, but not quite the MOO2 killer we had all hoped for.			"

												Game is unfinished. By that i dont just mean multitude of bugs, some of which are game-braking, but also full of half-baked, unthought-trough, placeholder features that certainly didnt go trough any User Experience departments.Like the ship designer for example:Its just a gimmick that gives the illusion you can design own ships and play the game with them. Well, you can deisgn them, but after each research (which finishes quickly) you would need to manually play with the numbers again and again and again to keep the ship up to date and able to fight enemies. Other option is full auto-best feature, which keeps the deisngs up to date itself, and you just click ""upgrade"" on your fleets after all new research completes. That basically removes the ship designer from the game, and turns your options while building ships and forming fleets into... 4 ship sizes. The only playable way to play the game. There is no way to influence the role of your ships, their designs, you either go full auto, or full manuall - both are dull and uninteresting. On top of that, if you are die-hard hardcore who want to manually upgrade ships each time you research new technology, or if you are trying to go middle-way, keeping core of your fleets ""auto-best"" to have optimal stats and adding to your fleets single, specialised ships like the support, shield-aura providing class, you will encounter a bug while upgrading fleet, that will turn all your core, auto-best battleships, into low dps aura providers... Making the fleet broken and useless. Only way to fix the results of the bug, would be to - guess what! - remove the class from designer and stop using designer whatsoever :) Here is the screenshot of my fleet upgrading into support class from different class (woudlnt be a problem, if you could switch classes of already built ships, but of course that is not ipmlemented).http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/259338860000669245/9103F8D5D0CF2B4C196E2F0843E2C3E5AAB26DEE/I dont know what were they thinking while making this feature. I can only guess it was to lie about how cool the game is. Its Europe Universalis watered down and simplified into uninteresting bug-ridden waste of time.			"

												While, I did enjoy my time with this space grand strategy game, there are just too many game breaking bugs for me to recommend it at this state. For one, the war in heaven event is completely broken. Without warning your vassals will be stolen from you, even skipping the whole war for independence part. If you were to try to take them back by force, the warscore you get from conquering their planets will be very megre due to the game thinking they are apart of the much larger alliance with their ascended empire overlord (even if you are only at war with your former subject). An unknown ticking warscore during a war for independance will start in favour of the rebels (even if you take their planets). Also, this may not techincally be a bug, but in my multiple playthroughs I have only encountered 1 type of endgame crisis due to the game's endgame algorithim always favouring the Unbidden (probably because fallen empires all have jump drives). Aside from bugs the game suffers from brain dead ai. The fact that all the victory conditions boils down to conquering/taking new planets narrows the playstyle by mid/late game. There's also little things like having to upgrade new buildings manually, 1 tier at a time. Overall, game has potential, but the devs have overlooked some major bugs and haven't fixed the core issues with the game.			"

												Stellaris is, at heart, Sword of the Stars III. Given that the original SotS was excellent and that SotS II was almost as good as Master of Orion III (snark intended), it's hard to guess how it turned out until you play it for a while.The early game is solid, with interesting choices for Xploitation, Xpansion, and Xploration.However, after the initial XXX phase is over, the game settles into a long, drawn-out death rattle of tedium from which you cannot avert your eyes and let the game progress in real-time because the developers removed almost all of the user-configurable auto-pause triggers from the game (they are just not there, an issue that also plagues the more recent Hearts of Iron IV). The recent ""Asimov"" patch does not cure the boredom-inducing real-time zombification of being forced to remain glued to the screen while you wait an interminably long time for things to happen or for your influence resource to creep high enough to allow you to make further progress.That missing feature is enough for me to tip this review from generally positive to generally negative.

												Stellaris is (real time) strategy game with a pinch of role playing elements and within the 4X genre.You are master, commander, president or whatever lordship of your own species (which traits - negative as well as positive you can choose from many) and you try to prosper throughout the entire galaxy.This includes not only the 4 X's, but also diplomatic and scientific issues and work.This is a rather challenging game (its not just ""easy""), however, the tutorials are quite complete and thorough. It will take some time to get used to and learn how the game mechanics work. It does not feel like work, though.Those who already know the publisher and producer of this game also know, that they are famous for rather complicated and challenging games. Stellaris might be considered one which is easier to get into (compared to other games).Stellaris is still actively worked at (as much as fans expect from the producers), in patches as well as in DLCs.

												Okay played a few times, for a while. It is okay. Wish it was more like GalCiv. The arbirtrary limits are painful on planets, leaders, etc. So you can't just do anything in the game. It would be easier if they allowed leaders but had only a few that would excel. it breaks reality that a planet, sector wouldn't have a leader, maybe they should have a negative or neutral set of characteristics, but having no one there bugs me. The five planet limit is awkward, have had hard sections where I just won a war and had 5 planets cede to me, it should allow leaders to extend the cap/offset the negative, so that you can micromanage more if required. Even the sectors you should be able to interfere on planets but building directly. Maybe restricted by government type.I guess that is my general issue with Paradox games, I like the control/freedom of GalCiv or Civilization style empire games. If you are going to place limits do it with thought to enjoyment of the game, cause I find that I hit those arbitrary limits on my empire.Such as stingy energy/credits unlikely you will be able to max out your fleet, forget about painting the map, your emprie will look like a paintball wall. Can't expand easily unless you have the planet types your species can deal with all happily in your current sphere or planets. Influence is also stingy, it very much limits your empire in impacting non aggression pacts, space stations, etc. Forget the empire that is at peace with everyone, or the United States empire, they have no influence. It's just funny odd decisions that remind me it's a video game vs drawing me into the sandbox.With some DLC's that remove these limits and help growth it's a better game, but I would have expected the developers to figure this out, to me Paradox games are Ivory Tower games, where they know best.

												First off:  This review is likely to change to a positive recommendation in the future when Paradox has fixed some of the bugs and added content that they've promised.  If you're curious about this game then I recommend you come back in a month or two after the game has been patched to 1.1.  If you're really eager to play this game then its definitely fun enough to buy, but you probably own it already.So what's the problem with Stellaris?  The first few hours of the game are fantastic.  Crafting your own empire and setting out into the stars to slowly expand your understanding of the galaxy, discovering secrets, and basically roleplaying your spieces is a great experience.  The galaxy feels both big and deep; ancient civilizations, pre-ftl species, and unusual technologies are all waiting to be found, and quest chains help to make your playthrough feel a bit more unique.  It's all very exciting.Unfortunately, Stellaris doesn't feel fully completed.  For one, the transition into the mid game is absolutely terrible.  While this is a Paradox game and you should expect to have stretches of time where you're not doing too much, the game abruptly goes from one with interesting sci-stories and roleplay into...nothing.  Virtually nothing happens outside of interacting with other empires, which is a problem because these interactions feel clumsy with the currently lackluster diplomatic actions (federations and alliances are simply not that fun).  Paradox has already acknowledged this midgame problem and is working to fix it.But even if you get past the mid-game and head into the late game (where there are events to help spice the game up), issues remain.  The game is riddled with bugs.  I'm almost 100 hours in and I haven't been able to finish any questline involving a ""Precusor civilization"" because the game bugs out each time.   When dealing with one of the late game threats, the game simply...removed them.  The quest log remained, but I could never finish it and advance the ""story"".  When the game shipped you literally could not remove one of the end game threats from planets.  These kinds of events are common and frustration, and they make the game feel empty, particularly when compared to how it starts.On the plus side, the game is still decent despite its flaws.  Expanding your space empire and deciding what to do with xenos can be fun, and as you can see I've put a lot of hours into it despite its flaws.  Nevertheless, be prepared for a lot of things that just don't feel completed on top of what I've mentioned (winning conditions, sectors, broken achievements, etc.).  Based off of Paradox's hsitory and their communications so far I'm confident the game will be fixed.  But for now, hold off.  It'll be a lot more fun when you play a completed version of the game that is full of unique events and quests that actually work the way they're supposed to.			"

												I haven't *really* played 196 hrs altogether for this game. Sometimes I have it put into observer mode in order to see what happens. But, I have been playing one single player game ever since Stellaris shipped: the Nova Terran Imperium (diaspora humans ready to conquer the galaxy to make it safe for humanity!)Traits: Natural Engineers, Sedentary, Strong, ResilientEthics: Militarist, Spiritualist, Individualist Gov't: Military Junta, later changed to a Martial DemocracyI recently looked at my leader, who was recently re-elected for my now Martial Democracy. She is Gabriela Ibanez, a Nova Terran ((human)) who is a champion of the people and resilient. She is also 228 years old.Now, whether my leaders are Xenos or Nova Terran, they usually die around 90. Resilient helped her, but there is nothing that I know of that explains why she has lived for 2 centuries. It could be a glitch, or as my father mentioned, it could be extragalactic invaders infiltrating my government. ((seeing some of the other events that can happen in this game, such as the not-tyranids showing up at one point, I wouldn't be surprised.)) Either way, looking at her age, she is just as old as the Imperium itself.She remembers the birth of the Imperium, when it incorporated the Tropical Eruxo into the empire by infltrating their primitive government and preparing them for integrating.She remembers the time when the Imperium tried to incorporate another primitive race, the Yssravanar, only to have a rogue agent try to hamper our efforts because of a woman. She also remembers the decision to bombard an entire city to kill the agent.She remembers the first ever war the Imperium fought against the Artic Immutharan, how our point defence technology countered their missile technology and led to the complete conquering of their empire.She remembers the massive expansion to the galactic south, leading to the Imperium becoming the largest power in the entire galaxy.She remembers when the Imperium, a Military Junta that only allowed humans to vote and lead, changed to the Republic, a Martial Democracy that allows Xenos to vote and become leaders.She remembers the countless wars that have brought the Republic prosperity.She remembers the psychic technolgies that have empowered the fleet and the armies to the point that we rival the Fallen Empires.She remembers the Scourge that came into the opposite side of the galaxy, and the plans to wipe them away like the plague they are.And now, she shall lead the Republic of Nova Terra, with its Psi Legions and the Conquistador Fleets, to conquer a Fallen Empire to prove how strong the Republic is.TL;DR: If you're on this page, you should buy this game			"

												Let me start by saying that I'm not a Paradox fanboy.  While I've had my fun dabbling in Cities: Skylines, I've never been quite able to break into Paradox's ""hard strategy"" games like CK2 or EUIV.  The five hours total that I have spent playing Crusader Kings 2 were five hours of essentially bumbling around in the dark trying to figure out how to assassinate a sibling.  With that in mind, Stellaris is one of the best gaming experiences I've had in years.  What it comes down to is that Stellaris is a game that completely understands its genre and I'm not just talking about strategy.  This game nails Science Fiction through emergent storytelling that unfolds as you expand your empire.  The initial thrill of venturing out of your home solar system for the first time, not sure what you'll find at the other end of an FTL jump.  The uncertainty that comes with making first contact with a sentient alien race.  Tackling the moral dilemas of slavery, war, and artificial intelligence.  And then of course the crescendo of facing one of the endgame crises that can mean the extincition of your civilization.  The best way I can put it is to imagine Star Trek except you're everyone in the Federation.  You're a scientist charting new worlds and civilizations and deciding to respect or violate the prime directive.  You're an admiral facing down an enemy fleet. And you're a diplomat juggling the needs of friends and foes alike.  Now that is an experience that I've truly never had in a videogame before, even other strategy games.  I give Stellaris the highest of recommendations and I imagine I'll be playing it for years to come.			"

												I myself didn't find Stellaris until a couple days before its release through Scott Manley's Youtube Channel. I'll admit, in that short time span, I got pretty hyped and pre-ordered it the day before release. While the game has its bugs and flaws, I find that the game itself still stands. It's a fantastic game when it comes to roleplaying a space empire, whether you want to be a peaceful democracy or a totalitarian collective. Even better yet, there is already a patch with great content coming in about a week.			"

This game is not like that it is well polished and definitely feels like a full game. I say polished because even with my macbook I can run it on high with absolutly no problems.

												Stellaris serves two masters, in that it is both an introduction to 4X and grand strategy games, and a game from Paradox, known for the insane depth of games like Crusader Kings. This means that it isn't especially pleasing to either party; some of the late-game strategizing isn't as good as it should be, with clunky mechanics making it difficult to manage large empires, but not in terms of gameplay, only in terms of interface. Some of the early game strategizing is difficult to parse, with some obscure mechanics in warfare and economic mangement. Some things are tedious for no apparent reason, and the pool of possible anomalies is depressingly small compared to the possible scale of the galaxy. Combat is shallow, but initially confusing, which seems to be the theme in this game; there's enormous potential (and some great music), and I simply can't tell you to buy it at the moment. Perhaps someday.			"

Product received for free
												The game has one big problem from my subjective viewpoint - warscore, instead of going out and conquering/wiping planets as you might be used to from another 4x games, it lets you define wargoals, where you can specify which planets you want to gain. There are 2 main isssues with this - you can only define small amount of planets as wargoal, seems 1/5 of your opponent´s per war. 2nd issue - there is 10 years forced truce after war. What does it mean? Instead of having control over the war and how it develops you are trapped in this artifficial system which is just prolonging the gameplay in cumbersome way where you have to wage several wars with long breaks in between. This lacks the fluidity and good pace of anotehr 4x titles. Not sure if I would bought the game knowing about the war-truce limited system. This problem might change with future update, but is currently creating blank spots in the gameplay.			"

Moron A.I makes war with an impossibly strong empire which drags their and our aliance into war. Things start pretty chill because they were pretty far from me. All of a sudden, they're in my borders. They. Destroy. Everything. They occupy my planets and start taking my resources. Finally the war ends and I'm the only one who suffered major casualties: 4 of my 6 planets are now under their rule, my entire fleet destroyed. All my ports, science and construction ships gone. At least I have my homeplanet intact. Suddenly the little furballs who started the whole damn mess leaves the alliance. All of a sudden I'm in war again. Its them. They got me into a war, saw me fall, left me for dead and came back to stab me while I'm down. MOTHERF-CKER F-CKING LITTLEFINGERED ME!10/10 Would plan revenge soon			"

												I am a huge fan of Paradox games and eagerly awaited the release of Stellaris. At first glance it was a wodnerful game with the complexity similar to other Paradox games. The more you play however the more it falls short and despite despartely wanting to like the game I have come to the realization that it was released to early and subsequent fixes to the problems will be released as DLC. Issues found with admitedly on 50 hours of game play are:Game speed slows down to a crawl in late game large maps.     Some sluggishness to be expected but this amount makes the game unplayable.War Mechanics are bugged for certain wargoals.      Vazzalization wargoal requires an player to vassalize the enemy to prevent them from gaining warpoints. As a result unless you biltzkreig them at the begining they and their allies will be able to defeat you. This is with the defender winning no major fleet engagements, conquering any planets or defending their home system,No Space Marines      A major source of content for most science fiction novels and games is completely absent from this game. The ground forces of Stellaris are limited to transport ship troops on shuttles that explode almost instantly upon any engagment. As a result transporting your troops is a cat and mouse game requiring vast amounts of micro managment to get your troops across the stars. You are even unable to have a fleet comprised of both main naval ships and transport ships. Until this is fixed I will be playing other games. Bring in the invading marines that are onboard warships. Allow ships to fit a module that would allow x amount of marines to be on board.Government Evolution     You would think that a game with many different speicies, government forms and ethos's would allow you to adapt to your current gameplay by allowing your government to reform. This is not the case. Why not allow for example a military dictatorship that expands and incorporates multiple different species to reform into a true democracy? It makes sense and could be managed very well by the game. Faction System     Similar to the rebel system from other Paradox games the faction system is for monitoring the discontented portion of your population. Rebels can oppose the government for many different reasons but by and large are easily defeated when they rebel. Realistically speaking this is wonderful because if one planet rebels against a intergalatic empire it would be easily put down. Unfortunately this raises the question as to why Paradox put the mechanic in in the first place. It feels woefully unfinished to me and the methods for quiteing factions is vastly uncreative.All in all I am very dissapointed with the released version of Stellaris. Hopefully these bugs will not matter to you but for me the game seems like a sloppy version rushed out of production.			"

												Pros:1) Many cool features, unique for 4X games. Especially good when describing species, that includes uplifting animals to level of sentient race, genetical modifications, creating sub-species. and so on. 2) Rich diplomacy including uniting multiple empires into Federations. And stupid AI that makes it difficult to expirience.3) Lots of customization for your race and empire (that are two different things!). You can play as human, bird, or even fungus! Your ethical framework limits policies you can use. Spiritualists dislike using robots, xenophobes dislike alien neighbors, individualists won't like being transfered to other planet withour their desire.4) Good graphics and music. And game performance is quite good. At least way better that in Europa Universalis by the same devs.5) Balance slows down development of big empires giving smaller empires chance.6) Great moddability. There are already good mods that fix the balance and add content.Cons:1) Unbalanced. Some ethos and government types are useless even if devs stated there can be many ways to play - there is only one - simple militaristic dictatorship expansion way to do things. Three types of weapons? Well, only energy weapons are of any use - all the rest are too weak. And so on and so on. This gives game poor replayability.2) Glitchy. The game itself does not crash but ingame mechanics does not work in way it is supposed to. For instance, possibles late game crisis is robot rebellion where all your robots rebel and go to exterminate all organics - Skynet style. To counter that all AI empires start to purge robots. That includes the rebel robot nation that eventually purges itself. FACEPALM. 3) Poor story telling. There is no story in the Universe. Or maybe there is, but you won't finish event chain for Precursors, there are not enough anomalies for that. IMPOSSIBLE!Conclusion: as of SUMMER 2016 I don't recommend the game. But as both developers and modders are still working to improve Stellaris, this game has potential.			"

												I have not played much but so far I really enjoy it, feels like a nice mix of EU and Civ, has the worker setup and early isolation/exploration, has a technological progression, colonization is important, all those feel like civ, diplomacy is like a very simple EU, there are barbarians of sorts, its in space and there are things you can do to make a planet habitable, have not gotten to that point yet, the combat is very EU; overall i feel it is a very good game with a surprisingly good tutorial considering the company that made it is not known for good tutorials, or even being consistent in working tutorials			"

												If Youve enjoyed sins of the solar empire youll enjoy this game.  It's polished, has a lot of content.  You can create your own empire, customize ships, and choose leaders for your armies or governors for your planets.Its a fun game for 39 bucks, no need to pay more unless DLCs are worth buying.The only 2 negatives that stand out are: You don't have options to tweak graphic settings, just a general Low/medium/high for everything. Its easy for my PC but im always a fan of open options.Another is later in the games, if your in large map the ships will freeze including the time clock as some sort of loading. I'm assuming thats because of all the info from all the other empires. So i had to start a new game with a smaller map.Overall good game especially new for 39 bucks.			"

												Stellaris is like sex- it can be really, really, REALLY good, or it can be awful, embarrassing and make you question your own decision-making process. I'm going to give it a thumbs up because the good moments are just so good. Recently, I joined a friend (IRL) in a war and he gave me a planet as thanks for helping him. I looked over this desolated world and decided to help the poor inhabitants. I rebuilt their economy, I built medical facilities for them, and I tried to peacefully integrate them into my society. They repaid me with sabotage and terrorist attacks. So, I exterminated them. Killed every single man, woman and child. The rest of the galaxy hated me for it, but nobody could really do anything about it thanks to my battleships. The combination of decision-based continuty and the randomness of events beyond our control is perfect and its probably the number one reason I love this game. There are things I hate about this game too, make no mistake- war is, as another reviewer put it, tedious as f**k. Sometimes your admiral ignores your orders and sucidally charges into an unwinnable battle. Sometimes that one other empire is just a f**cking as***ole. But the drama of it all, the symphony of the galaxy, is why I keep coming back.			"

												One of the best ""4x"" games I have played...... ever. This and ""Endless Space"" brought me back to a genre that has become stale and unapproachable. I even enjoyed the DLCs and feel they were worth the money. I have long been a fan of the ""Civilization"" series, and Stellaris comes as close as I have ever seen to a ""Civilization"" in space. My only ""con"" for this game is when the galaxy gets very large and very complex, the system bogs down processing. While a high performance computer could probably run it with little interruption, I feel they need to work on the program resource optimization. Solid 9/10 and money well spent. "

												Stellaris starts out rather strong, but really goes downhill in the mid to late game phases. Early exploration gives a lot of things to do, but the game itself grinds to a halt in the mid to late game where things are very static and repetitive. It's just declare war, steal some planets, repeat. Combat has no strategic depth, causing each war to have a simple battle between massive fleets that compose all of each nation's navy with the larger numbers winning that battle and effectively winning the whole war. When all this is combined with the general lack of features, the game has very litle replayability, and thus I cannot reccomend anyone buy it in its current state.			"

												Early Game was phenominal, but the mid to late game felt like an unfinished product. Combat was initially fun as well. Until I learned that building big ships means nothing when the ai just frigate spam and defeat fleets 10x their size. The novelty of this game is endearing, but once you dive into it you realize it's a chore list in space you need to do. Buy it on sale, preferably with the future dlc included.			"

Posted: July 2, 2016
												It's still Beta!Another bare bones game rushed out the door. This one already had a DLC tab on launch.A poor combination of Distant Worlds and Galactic Civilizations.The game tries to limit you as much as possible to still be playable. I was frustrated with the game, can't do this, can't do that, can only play it a certain way.....Played it enough to figure this out:All you do most of the game is survey stars and build mining/research stations.Another game where the AI plays the game for you since you can only directly manage 5 colonies in your empire. Anything beyond 5 has to be AI controlled. And it will replace buildings you don't want replaced with other buildings (it's rather dumb to the point that it won't upgrade any buildings it's built).It has lots of broken game mechanics. (i.e. click on planet, click colonize = nothing happens, all the unassigned colony ships just ignore it).Broken quests. (A few you can't complete because there are no objectives or are blank).Popups on top of popups. The popups you need you never get (i.e. research completed, war declared, etc).The popups you do get are repetative, the game will tell you you found something, a short pointless narrative and then you click either fascinating, amazing, or interesting. But none of these actually do anything for you. But they are annoying and they freeze the game.You can't queue your research, and since you don't get a popup for it, you'll often miss that it was completed. What you will get is a small bubble icon at the top of the screen that disappears rather quickly.A leader died? Another small bubble icon at the top of the screen (if you're not watching for it you'll miss it).War was declared? Another small bubble icon at the top of the screen (all the bubble icons have a limited delay that isn't changable).Shows planets that are colonizable (green circle = desirable), but you can't actually colonize them since you haven't researched that technology yet or your race really doesn't like them.If your race likes (i.e.) tropical and you conquer a primitive race that lives on a turndra, then every tundra planet on the galactic map will have a green (desirable) circle next to it. Sure, makes sense, it's inhospitable, but desirable.Every AI empire you meet will hate you. Where's the ""Advanced Diplomacy system worthy of a Grand Strategy Game.""Due to border friction, it's impossible to get anywhere with dipomacy. And they'll constantly ask you to turn over border planets. Saying no = war.War = You've just conquered 5 AI planets, but you can't annex them, only cecede one of them to end the war (based on warscore earned and government). Over-powered enemies. (i.e. Advanced established empires (overwelming compared to you) that always seem to declare war on you when you're barely getting started). No option to disable them.Very limited leaders (10, 3 of them must be for research, the other 7 will be on science ships). Why even have the option for governers, generals, or admirals?Combat is just graphical, you can't control anything. After the first few battles it gets boring to watch. No option to see all your ship commands, so you end up sending ships on the same missions over and over.All space stations build ships at the same pace regardless of what size it is. The only point of upgrading to a larger size is to build bigger ships. And each station can only build 1 ship at a time.No option to sort ships. Ships, fleets, planets are all on a the same scrollable side bar (lots of scrolling constantly)Pro's?They added mod support. It probably hurt them to have to do that, but mod support = more sales.You can create your own race.End game? You're overrun by a new super race that out guns you in every respect.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 3/7/17:They've really made the game stupid now. If you get war declared on you, as the defender you can only defend against enemy ships until they're all destroyed, but they can invade you and keep your planets. You can invade planets, but you can't keep them. WTF! Why the F*** would anyone want to invade a planet if at the end of the war they have to return it. Bombarding planets still sucks, it destroys the planetary fortification level. I have yet to actually kill any pop or destroy buildings at full bombardment.They've nerfed the planetaryspace stations to make them useless in combat. Used to be they were good defense for your planets, but no more, now they're easily killed. I forgot to mention in my original review that every empire you meet hates you. Unless you give them gifts (works only once). But typically their dislike of you will constantly increase. Even those who ask you if they can be your vessel will end up hating you.Also remove is the option to terraform the planets you've colonized. And to even get to the tech where you can terraform a planet will take you days in real time.On the plus side you can turn off Fallen empires (advanced AI) and you finally get a popup when someone declares war on you.Other then this, I see nothing else new. I would expect in a game like this for the player to be able to chose what you get as a popup, bubble or not. Obviously whoever worked on it doesn't see many things as importants and the useless stories. To me I want to know when reasearch is done or my planet is invaded, but no, still the easily overlooked bubble at the top of the screen.The only thing making this a grand strategy game is the grand amount of time to get anywhere, from research (which takes years for one tech) to your ships moving, to you planet pop growing. I should also mention that time ticks away by days. Had a tech that took 100 months to research. Ofcourse you can speed it up and slow it down, but if you go too fast, you'll miss other things.They need to add an option to directly control more planets then 5 or so. For me, I want to control my empire, not to have the AI control it. And the AI is stupid when it comes to controlling your planets.I play alot with mods, makes the game more interesting for a while longer, but eventually you hit that point where you just lose interest in the game.Most of my game time is waiting for something to happen.It's fun in the beginning, then it gets repetative/bland and eventually boring.

												Stellaris makes a great first impression.  The game looks great.  The interface is easy to use.  The font for the text is actually readable (I'm looking at you Distant Worlds).  The early game is very addictive.  The science ship exploration stuff works.  Setting up mining and research stations is a bit simplistic but still diverting.  And the colony management is fairly well done.  Unfortunately, then the game transitions to the mid game, where is falls flat.  Instead of constant expansion (part of 4""x""), the borders of your empire stagnate as you jut up against one random alien race or another.  Diplomacy bogs down to the old math equation of what your faction is and how much whatever you are offering is worth to the target.  The game displays this in numeric terms which is about as dry as shoe leather.  So you invade to get the ball moving again and are immediately beset with ""war goals"", as though instead of an all powerful space empire who attacks when and where you please you must first sit down and write a note to the other side with the appropriate grievances you have.  ""Dear Adolph, we object to you and demand the liberation of A) France B) Belgium C) Poland...""  and so on.  It's ridiculous.  Diplomacy is a slog, or worse, a non-event.  Combat itself is simplistic.  No naval tactics.  The various sides fly to point blank range and circle around firing at each other.  Ship design basically boils down to focusing on one of three types of weapon systems (lasers, missiles, or projectiles) and how many shields or armor you can power into your ships.  No boarding.  No fighters.  No individual ship experience.  Which is kind of a shame.  Because it looks great and for the first few hours you'll be having a blast.  The leader leveling system is kind of neat.  Some of the science events that pop up are cool.  Sadly, this all goes by the wayside further in and you are left staring at various colored blobs on the map wondering if you maybe colonize a planet before your rival.  The game has potential, but ultimately falls well short of what I believe is the best 4x game available now, Distant Worlds Universe.  That game has a civilian economy that is fairly complex and outside the player's direct control.  Pirates that make more than a guest appearance in one battle early on in the game.  And frankly, the ability to attack who you damn well want to and go where you damn well want to without having to write a note or have a committee meeting.  Also, that Star Trek mod!  Stellaris looks good at first.  But much like some strange brew of tea you initially approve of, it has an unpleasant aftertaste.  IGN got it right, don't believe the fan boys.  ""DLC will add espionage and the fun"" is not an argument in favor of the current release.			"

												This game has a lot of potentiall but I would not recommend it in the current state. It is very fun at first in the exporation phase, but when your empire gets bigger the problems start to appear. The AI factions are super passive and only sit on itheir planets and wait. for like 30 hours I've been decleared war on one time. This is a contrast to EU when wars frequently errupted and borders shifted. Things happened in that game.There are bugs wich makes certain factions impossible to kill unless u use console to trigger events wich should have occured. The thing that bothered me the most though was how hard it was to overview and Macro your empire.  For example a missing intuative EU feature such as a build tab. If I want to build solar panels on my space stations, I have to go into every individual planet and press a button. This is annoying when you have over a 100 hundred planets. same when building starships, you have to go through every planet where u want to build them and press individually. To even access your  planets you have to enter the ""empire"" meny first, then press a specific planet, then go back and forth  in an unresponsive and tiring way. Some kind of ""next planet"" button would help alot. When colonizing u first have to find one of ur planets containg the right race adapted for that climate (by scrolling through them all, build them a colony ship, go back to the planet u want to colonize then press coloinze and select the ship you built (there is no other simple way of finding that ship again), then finally press colonize. God! why cant i do all that in just one click at the colonizeable planet!? it's just so much micro.Also peace negotiation lacks many feutures from EU, such as forcing empires to leave alliances, giving up vassals, making factions leave the war alone and leave their allies and you can never demand more than your specific war goal, wich was very limiting form the beginning. I can go on for pages on things that annoy me, that makes the game a repetitive klick-fest. In time I think more features and macro will be updated, but this is very annoying to play. I advise patience.			"

Posted: May 25, 2016
												I can say to summarise right now, Stellaris earns it value in price.... however it does have things that need to be addressed along with additional issues that have caused some to give it a lower opinion of it. Here I will discuss about the overall view I have on Stellaris.Let’s start by getting some positives out of the way to not make this look negative, what did Paradox do right with Stellaris?Ai Randomising of Factions: In almost every game I’ve played in Stellaris I’ve always enjoyed the randomness of the Ai with their factions and how chanced creativity with the ethics and governments makes for some crazy combinations in Ai Empires. I like how each idea I've seen feels in ways the same and yet different at the same time. It would make more sense to have this instead of set created ones since that would take hours if not days of thinking and writing up. Plus unlike in other Paradox games you don't have an entire era of history to base on so you have to make do with what you have. Kudos for trying Paradox!Creating your own Empire: With other Paradox games the ability to start out and make your own faction/dynasty/kingdom/Empire at the beginning was only a later feature most of the time, with this it works, sure the features are limited on release and right now I would like a few extra pieces here and there, but to get players into this game, the customisation is easy to work with and fun to create some silly combinations. Heck the customisation system alone helped me with some Sci Fi writing I’m working on with some friends of mine.Ship Modification: Part of my enjoyment from this game was seeing what cool and fancy ship designs I could come up with, with the technology progression it just kept me more interested in getting that latest weapon or powerful item to put onto them. I'm hoping when mods become meatier that we can have ship modifications from sci fi franchises, though this could be limited due to rights and trademarks.System Discovery and Research projects: At First I found doing this to be tedious but over time, discovering stuff from research led to me as a player finding out about some interesting and rare technologies and things. I like how some games promote the idea of unique projects to research like for example finding out about ancient empires long lost and you doing some deep space exploration to find what happened to them or finding a way to prevent a potential extinction of your race. The random generation of galaxies also helps to make different starts sometimes challenging with different allocation of resources and research at your disposal, nothing is set in stone which can lead to repeated playability. Mod Support: This isn't something new to Paradox, but still good to see that they are continuing with their tradition in having their games supporting the mod systems is something perfect for Stellaris. Since with many sci fi genres out there, it is a very attractive place to include cosmetic and game play like features outside of DLC and patches. This can result in possibly dozens if not hundreds of hours in replayability.Now we have to move onto Things I don't like about this game in its current state and general concerns, Remember I'm not going to bash a game that's making an effort to try, but I'm also going to constructively criticise some bad choices made by Paradox in making stellaris as well.The Release with Achievement Bugs and glitches: Firstly if you are going to release a game and it has a wide variety of achievements, make sure they are at least obtainable and not have major bugs that stop you from accessing them. Bugs in where you have a leader live to be 400 can be overlooked, but having a bug that stops you accessing a Scourge achievement isn't acceptable. Personally Stellaris should have been postponed at least 2 weeks to really flesh and Iron out the game. I know every game is known to have Bugs and glitches on release; it’s naive to think it won't have any, but obvious ones that should have been checked before release like achievement related ones........that is disappointing. A lack of Achievements: Personally the amount of achievements we have with this game right I think is surprisingly small, this is  a 4x Strategy game I was expecting to see almost twice as many then the ones we got. Don't get me wrong the achievements they have are creative, I just feel we should have gotten much more on release. That way until they come with DLC's and Patches we still have something to play around with. Since I've gotten at least 3/4's of the achievements with the last not getting around to or unable to because of bugs.  At the end of this review I'm going to post a Paradox forum topic which I made that shows some achievement ideas I came up with along with ideas to improve the game. Feel free to check it out and add some of your own ideas.A Lack of Crisis's: The ideas for the Crisis's that Stellaris has are interesting for them to spawn, the trouble is, there are only 3, I would prefer if those were some of the BIG Crisis events that effects everyone involved with Ai responding to them and not hanging back like chickens or lemmings. What they could have included was internal crisis's too, for example civil wars where like 1/3 to 1/2 +  of your worlds even worlds in sectors break away and could result in your empire tearing itself apart. Or maybe a power in a desperate bid to over throws your current government. There needs to be more of a focus on things like these so the gradual progression in the game doesn't dull down.So for now I honestly don’t have much to say since from hearing back from Paradox’s recent Clark patch they seem to be fixing some of the Ai problems in not seeing as a threat along with other UI features and stuff. However I shall leave this link herehttps://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/stellaris-patch-and-dlc-suggestions.937072/This as I have stated before in this review is a topic I created for users to add some Suggestions for Paradox to work with Stellaris.For now Stellaris to me is a Game that I’ll be honest I’m biased towards, it has its problems, the Ai is buggy, there are glitches in the game and some features feel like they need to be added. This could have been intentional for DlC. But despite all of that, I’ve enjoyed this game, it has already earned its value back from me in the amount of hour’s I’ve played it, multiplayer has been fun with friends of mine, And I do like the features paradox shows for Federations and Alliances, but they need to be expanded upon.So my Verdict is for Stellaris “Worth looking into, but wait for at least a few patches before getting into playing.”In fairness when Eu4 first came out, it had problems and over time it was patched and had a tonne of DLC added for better or worse and I’ve enjoyed that game myself a lot.

												I left the very first review I wrote of Stellaris below.They tried to remedy the midgame void with some kind of success.Now the end game is empty really.But more than this, it is the lack to attention to details and all the incomplete elements of the game which forbid me to recommend an amateurish software development.For example :- the devs decided to remove auras from the ships themselves to keep them to defense stations only. Well kinda. For example they forgot to change the state of the aura you get from the fortress.So you can research it for 2 years for nothing : you can't use it at all. Too man game elements like this one are in the game but not usable because of a lack of development.Also you will have to look online to understand how elements of the game work, and the auras is just one element amongst many.Let's not forget the absolutely awful interface, not giving you proper information (just a general number) about your fleets, forcing you to click 3 times when 1 would be enough (hey how about focusing on the army you launched in space instead of forcing you to launch it, then find it in the horribly rigid listing of pyour space thingies, and then click it ; same thing goes for the defense stations really, just allow to click on their icon  in the general map ... but nooooo  that would be too intuitive, you have to zoom to the system and seletc th physical station with a click).The UI feels like a 1990 badly thought Schwarzeneger movie.When you have to jump through these UI dumb hoops over and over again, you wish you could punch iin the face the ine person responsible for it all it there was one really.Yay.This kind of lack of attention is encountered throughout the game.Unfinished story lines.Unfinsihed quest lines.- All these problems were there from the beginning and have still not been adressed in the latest patch 1 year after release.So yes : amateurish development and following up on the elements of the game.Still here one year after. Mocking customers through their attention to implementation.I said this would be a good game when copmpleted some years from now. But the rate of corrections of non complete or blocked out quests simply hanging there for no reason, the lack of seriousnesss of the developpers on their game elements still forbid me to recommend the game.Oh you will spend a long time with it. And you will get frustrated when encountering half developed elements of it all.Wasting your investment in hours long games because of lack of follow through capacity from developers.It  is not even is as if the logical sequences are very complicated to correct really, it looks more like ther is a lack of man power investment of a high selling game to correct a faulty piece of software.And despite the investement of what lookss like a 2 person team t deveolop Stellaris to a full game, it is still an incomplete piece of oo often encountered broken software through out your play through.So much potentiual to waste for a lack of investment is a real stain on the professionalism of Paradox, hence my  still negative review.\Original review after release : The released game is barebone and buggy : you will spend your time accelerating time and waiting for whatever new meaningless research you have to go throuh.There is pretty much no visual feedback to your progression and tech advances. None.The only way to have any meaningfull enjoyable with the game is if you add a lot of mods to it.And even then will the whole largely defined middle game experience (80% of the game) be empty and shallow.Game mechanics that should work simply don't because they are bugs and once again you will need mods to correct those as there is no clear indication from the devs what is working and what is not.Maybe in 2 years with some DLC will this be any good. Right now it is just shiny and giving a good enough illusion of depth for most people to be happy, begin 10 games, finish 1 eventually, or maybe rather just giving up in the end when the victory conditions are just impossible to reach in any interesting manner.But don't get fooled, there is no AI and nothing to do besides waiting for your researches to advance and trying to make any meaning of the stupid stupid stupid way the whole conquer and war and diplomacy and trade (non existant) is implemented.It is unbelieveable how gullible people are and how companies can get away releasing such an unfinished product hidden behind a bit of graphical niceties. Such a game and its hype and broken mechanics is a pretty good reason not to buy games anynore.Never again from this dev.			"

												The fact that you can't make war demands after 90 days in a defensive war makes me give this game a thumbs down.I had a major faction declare war on me and spent 3 hours conquering every single planet they own and destroying all their units. Result? You have to give ALL of it back to them. You would think that if you destroy all their units and take over all their plants, you could then eliminate them... No. You give it all back to them and have to wait 10 YEARS before you can declare war on them again and then have to re-do the entire process. They don't give any info that you have to make wargoals in the first 90 days, despite having the tutorials on. Fine... you re-do the entire process and wait 10 years to declare war on them... Want to then eliminate them completely? You can't, you can only select a few planets that you can conquer and then have to wait another 10 years before declaring war again. 30 years go by to defeat a weak enemy. What a terrible system.First 2 hours of the game is learning the gameplay. Next 12 hours is great. The sound and graphics are beautiful. Then you realize lack of depth in the endgame, it gets repetitive and easy, and then you notice ground-breaking missing features that are just annoying. Research tree is randomized.... You may have to wait a LONG time before you get what you need. This is somewhat strategic, but mostly annoying. Other games handle this way better. Combat based research is always WAY overpowered.Wait a year or two before things are fixed, balanced, and all the DLC comes out. The game has fantastic potential and I am sure the problems can be ironed out. I will happily change this to a thumbs up if at least some of the above problems are fixed.			"

												THIS IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW, SEE MY UPDATED REVIEW BELOW IT> How to review this.... well, I started playing it on a thursday if memory serves and oly played about a half hour... thought meh, its okay..     Then, friday night happened...   I played for what felt like a while, realizing that this game had a TON of depth of stategy to it, suddenly I had a terriblle pain in my head and I could hear birds singing outside... I had played for 11 hours... straight.  This game is Awesome.   the best RTS game ive ever played bar none. For me the funnest part of any Conquest rts style game is the empire building that happens at the start long before the wars happen... this game never really seems to end, you are not going to kill of an entire enemy civilization in one fell swoop, much as it would be in reality you must manage your forces well to both defend home sectors, collect resources, trade, produce, and Occupy planets that you have taken over. you will not play this game in 1 sitting, ive played 53 hours in only 5 sittings and Am only now realizing the depths of this, it has not yet become routine and my strategy has been forced to adapt continually to survive. I was almost destroyed by an enemy ( who posed as a friend and geve me minerals for a looong time only to suddenly and unexpectedly exploit my boarder permissions ) only to gain the upper hand with a battleship and a awesome skilled commander ( thank you spider warrior named Hasooon ), that civilization is now a vallal under my own and hates me passionatelly bet cant do♥♥♥♥♥♥.. I own everything of theirs and when they try to revolt BAM install my slave governer and enslave the whole planet, eventually they will learn to not revolt.  the game happens 1 day at a time... your governers get old and wiser and then ( sometimes at bad bad times ) die.. I had a big fleet fighting off some invaders and didnt realized the notification that my commander in charge had died.. I was buisy scouting new galaxys only to realize that 90% of my ships in that fleet were destroyed. :(   the A.i. is unforgiving and the game is IMO birlliant.  If you like strategy games, THIS is the game you should get right Now... but be warned, my sleep has severely suffered as a result.    it does have a learning curve, and seems like a lot to take in at first but its actually pretty easy to learn... and it has yet to get stale, new things keep happening that keep me thinking and on my toes....  this is the game Ive long awaited.   Elite Dangerous would benafit by examining this engine instead of having a billion systems with nothing at all happening and nothing to do but grind grind grind..      Stallaris.  Build buildings, manage populace, design and build your own ships, expand your boarders and empire, negotiate treatys and conflicts, hire and fire generals, governers, admirals, scientists, manage research tech, manage fleets and starports, I could literally go on and on and on forever about how much depth the strategy has... also you dont necisarilly need to win by war means, you could be defensive and win by having the majority of the planets and systems.. ( which you can explore and terraform also )    This is actually the longest review Ive ever done on a game ever..    buy this game..   AND it feels like its polished and clean unlike so many recent games released in the past years.   This is quickly becoming my favorite game... now, I just need to remember to set an alarm to stop playing cause it hurts my brain to play game for such long periods... but even with the brain pain when i turn it off and go away I find myself in my day to day wondering ""should I destroy that ignorant mushroom looking civilization for takin g over that sector i wanted ? ""    and how will I do so... maybe i will wait for another 100 years..    So far more than 2000 years have gone by on the time scale...   ive not yet tried the online and am not entirely sure how it will work so I cant comment there, but I have faith that it will also be awesome.   UPDATED...  well, its too long.. sorry but multiplayer is rediculous. also the game gets really really buggy towards the end of game when there is too much happening. not slow, actual bugs.. like  buttons dont do what they are supposed to type bugs.. this annoys the hell out of me that I had to play a game for 30 hours over multiple days just to discover this. also diplomacy means nothing against AI, and you will war just Cause... and when you do you can blob your entire Fleet together and just go kill off the enemys mining platforms and it4 cripples their entire empire... they never think to do this to you though, instead opting for planetary invasions even if they are doomed to fail.  just for fun, yesterday I made war with 14 different species in the galaxy... they still warp into my sector filled with fortresses and die... constantlly... not learning at all....   after my previous review I feel sad to say it, but this game is not complete and in all its stuff it lacks some simple details that are far more important. I would now recomend it on sale... seriously though, who has 16 hours straight to stay in a multiplayer game??  what were they thinking ??  final review ././... Meh			"

												At first I was hesitant to write a review with having such a short amount of time played, but after seeing the other negative reviews and their significantly larger number of hours played, as well as watching a lot of YouTube gameplay before making my decision and going for a refund, I now feel confident with giving this game a thumbs down. Now, don't get me wrong: The game isn't bad. It's just severely lacking in content, which is a common Paradox strategy, as it opens up the door for them to bleed your wallet dry in the future with great quantities of DLC. Which is fine, because with every DLC the game becomes better. But it means that the base game, at the time of release, is often barebones, and that is the case with Stellaris. The game is basically this: explore new systems, colonize them, build structures to harvest resources from them, build a massive fleet to wipe out whatever unknown force is occupying the next system, and then explore/colonize/build/etc in that one, one by one until you win. There's very little depth to civic administration, and combat is just throwing numbers at smaller numbers and watching as attrition plays its part. There's very little substance to the gameplay, and in the mid to late game, it becomes an almost unmanageable micro-fest with more time spent paused than playing (unless you're REALLY good at micro). As it currently stands, it's not worth it. In 6 months to a year, sure, there will be new content which makes the game better. But for now, hold off on it, unless you wanna get it on the summer sale. And even then, be warned.			"

												Good game when it comes to graphics, performance, I think they fixed a few bugs which I have yet to notice, but the game IS lacking in a few departments.1.)Tech tree is not your typical tech tree, where it gives you a list or path of techs you can get. It gives you an option of 3 or 4 tech options to choose from, based on your government set up in the beginning of the game and what you've already researched. This means that upgrading to better ships is not an easy task, unless you do some research on google, chances of getting better ships is trial and error.2.)There's no real trading. Meaning you don't collect certain valuable resources that can be traded for favors. There are no trading zones or lanes, no trading buildings or vessels. Trade seems to be a huge advantage in these types of games and this game lacks it.3.) Combat is a little ridiculous. You have the option to make a ton of ""fleets"" but you might as well meld them into 1 giant fleet and try dominating other planets. The animation has them swarming around each other, but that's not very realistic combat in space. You can't exactly do tactical movements and the game doesn't tactically put important ships in the back with fodder in the front, because when you attack another fleet it's just 1 large swarm of missiles, lasers and projectiles. Sins of a Solar Empire has much better fleet/battle mechanics4.)Once you get to a certain point where you make insanely large amounts of social influence, energy credits and minerals, the game is just sort of click and play, the most you have to do is micromanage random factions that appear in your worlds.5.) There is no esponiage. You'd think espionage would be a big part of a space game, park your stealth ship in orbit in another's empire, learn their movements, important travel lanes, economy and sense of political stability/instability so you can attack them at the right time or place. There's none of that.6.)A few aspects of the enemy AI. I have yet to be majorly attacked by them, even after openly declaring total war with the intent of subjugating few and purging the rest. A few skirmishes, but I have yet to have a full on war with another empire that took all of my attention and focus. I'm guessing that if you chose hard mode, war becomes impossible with them because you'll lose, not sure if true or not because i've only been playing mid difficulty.That's all I really have on it. For the price, I'd pay for something else, but if you don't care about money and need to throw away some time I'd get it.			"

												Allow me to preface this review by stating that Stellaris is an unfinished product. No matter how I or anyone else may feel about this game, be it positive or negative, this game was blatantly left unfinished by the developers at release. If you purchase this game, expect a host of features to be left in a foundational state that will necessitate the purchasing DLC for a ""full experience.""AbstractStellaris is a procedurally generated science fiction strategy game, melding traits from both 4X and grand strategy. An empire/race builder launches the campaign, allowing you to design your primary species: appearance, physiological traits, ethics (which determine your empire's socio-political alignment), favored weapon type, ship/planet cosmetics, etc. Upon completing your empire, a galaxy is generated for you by means of several options (galaxy type, size, number of AI, etc.) and you begin your journey from the day your civilization develops faster-than-light spacefaring capability.GraphicsThe Stellaris universe is simple but gorgeous. The galaxy is populated with a host of stars, beautifully detailed planets, craggy asteroid belts, vivid nebulae, and abyssal black holes. Dozens of fascinating and creative alien portraits populate the game's biosphere. The UI and other interface elements do need work, however. The empire building screen at game start suffers from an unnecessary amount of negative space. When in the campaign itself, several interfaces (such as the ship designer UI or the planet building screens) tend to either block the gameplay screen or suffer from ""too many buttons to click"" syndrome, requiring a large amount of slowed or paused gametime whilst you micromanage.StoryThe storytelling capability in Stellaris is immense. In just under forty hours of gameplay, I've racked up a host of adventures in intergalactic politics, wars and general mechanical quirks. A key factor is the empire building capability - I love creating my own empires specifically designed for the AI and enabling them to appear in my campaigns. There's nearly unlimited of roleplaying potential here. The primary vehicle that drives the story are the event chains - overarching narratives that really drive your expansion and exploratory impetus throughout the early game, but unfortunately tend to drop off until the late game. Randomly generated late-game crises such as synth rebellion, extradimensional invaders and more can shake things up substantially in the late years of your campaigns.GameplayAs stated, the early game of Stellaris is fantastic. Throughout multiple playthroughs, the sense of exploration and mystique never seems to go away as you set out into your galaxy for the first time. As you start to colonize more and more planets, delegate sectors and begin engaging in galactic-state politics, however, the game slows down and becomes even somewhat of a slog.ConclusionAs it stands, Stellaris is an unfinished game with very promising potential, capability and strong mechanics for a foundation. Though undoubtedly it's my current favorite title because I can look past these flaws and see that it'll be built upon and made into a truly fantastic sci-fi experience, I can't quite recommend it to a casual or entry-level grand strategy gamer right yet. I recommend it wholly to Paradox veterans and people willing to look past the DLC model.As a friend put it, Stellaris needs its ""Art of War"" (one of the key expansions for Europa Universalis IV which truly ""completed"" the game.) This pricing model of releasing a barebones product and reinforcing it with well over $150 in DLC is getting old and needs to be called out.

												I really love this game, but cannot recommend it at the moment. It is full of bugs and feels unfinished. Late game is basically a slide show, especially when you're moving your fleet. I'm at war with a fallen empire right now and my allies just keep their fleets attached to mine. I have to wait for a reeeeeeeally long time just to get to the destination point. I'll gladly recommend this game as soon as Paradox will finally do something about it. Early game is just as amazing as late game frustrating. Diplomacy in game is a joke BTW.			"

												Sooo, Stellaris finally. Greatly hyped, greatly anticipated, greatly dissapointing in the end for some. Is it perfect? No. Can you kill an whole species, enslave humanity and essentially make them pets? Yes. So, easily best game of 2016 10/10But yeah, seriously. The game fundamentally works, is fun and has an good early game. BUT. It stumbles hard in the midgame, doesn´t really get up in the mid-late game, and falls even harder in the very late game. Bad diplomacy, currently unbalanced combat, and an meh AI (note that i wrote this before the Clarke update went out, so the last two things will get fixed soon).So, why do i still recommend it? Because it is fun. And because PDS developed it. It might not be perfect now, but infiltrating an primitive species to make them slaves just never stops being great. And it will only get better.			"

Some things are straight up better then others (looking at you Wormhole FTL). You can get ♥♥♥♥ed very quickly by a bad start, as is what happens in most randomized games like this.I will say this though, I recommend this game completely. This is the golden jewel of Paradox. Patches are coming out with many fixes to the problems that plagued game at launch. (Looking at you, Corvette Spam)The foundation of this game is there, and it is made of marble and gold. Probably the best Space 4X game I've played in a very long time. It's up to Paradox to continue to flesh this game out, as while it's pool is slightly more shallow then I want. Paradox has a lot of digging equipment to give this game the depth it deserves.			"

												In typical Paradox fashion, Stellaris is a game that will not disappoint if you are in it for the long haul. It's not for the casual, with a steep learning curve, and feels a bit immature compared to the existing (and intimidating) Paradox lineup. I'll say with conviction Stellaris is the best 4x space sim that's ever been made. Not for any specific domain or aspect of the game, but for how it's all put together.If you're an existing Paradox fan, you might feel a bit disillusioned at first, primarily because Stellaris doesn't yet have the depth that, say, Crusader Kings does. Diplomacy has little subtlety, for instance, and the AI tends to get super lethargic as the game drags on. However, combat is intricate and refined, the expansion mechanics are fun and rewarding, the challenge level is very flexible, and you see the roots of a lot more that Paradox has in store. A lot of people are saying they're going to wait until Paradox pushes out a bunch of expansion packs or DLC or whatever. After having spent 100+ hours, I'm going to say don't wait. The game as-is is fantastic, worth the price of admission, and unlike many fire-and-forget developers, you know Paradox will come up with something every few months that keeps you interested. Play it for a few weekends, have a blast, get burned out, then come back and learn to love it all over again. For a quick comparsion to other titles: Egosoft and the X series is the heavyweight champion of the space sandbox. Frontier and Elite take it home with the arcade combat and polish. Firaxis with the Civ series are examplary at engaging strategy. Stellaris is a game that combines all of those elements, and somehow actually make it work. It's surprising, and you won't be disappointed.			"

												Disappointed and bored. There no cloak and dagger game play here. Boring Diplomacy. No real trade/economy. It doesn't feel like a Paradox game at all yet. It's like everything that made CK2 amazing was ignored. Even the portraits are so bland in comparison. I hate seeing my species's single portrait recolored and reused over and over for my scientists, leaders, etc. It feels like I would have to play online for there to be any worthwhile co-op game play. The AI seems to just want to do their own thing. And even if they are friendly there isn't much they can do for the player.I'm sure like all the other Paradox games there will be plenty of more to come. I will revise my review and take Stellaris off the shelf at later date... At this very moment I've spent more time browsing the workshop trying to find mods to make this game fun than in the actual game... I've wasted countless years on EU1 2 3 4, CK2, Vic1 2 and I look forward to coming back to to this game when it is not so boring as well.			"

												Released before it was ready.- clunky UI- Poorly balanced mechanics- multiple major (game breaking) bugs in core aspects of the game (sectors, combat, pops, diplomacy)- uncountable number of minor bugsThere's a lot of work needed to bring this game to where it should be.If PI move in the right direction with patches, then eventually (12-18 months) it'll be good - perhaps best in class.However past experience with CK2 & EU4 makes me doubt whether their vision & my vision of what constitutes a 'better' 4x grand strategy are fully aligned.If Stellaris reaches it's full potential, then it might well be the grandest of 4x grand strategy, however as it is right now it's a disappointment.5/10.

Posted: May 15, 2016
												Having played this game like a second job since release, I can recommend Stellaris as a flawed but great space 4x/Grand Strategy game. The premise of the game revolves around building an empire within a single galaxy (of between 100-1000 stars.) One wins by controlling 40% of colonizable worlds (there are a lot) or subjugating every other empire on the board. The game can be broken down into early, middle, and late game portions, and I'll review the game across those parts.Pre-Game:+You have the opportunity to build a custom race from scratch - do it! The deep level of race creation will define who your empire is, what their ethos are, and what their government is. This will dictate much of how the game plays for you once you start the game. Great customization and depth.Early-Game:+The Early Game exploration is fantastic. It's simply the best example in the genre of a small empire starting out and everything being mysterious/threatening/interesting. The event chains, especially in the early game, add a huge amount of flavor and vibrancy to the universe; there are some event chains that will only appear in a given galaxy, so you won't see every possibility in a single game.+Planet management is solid; you will balance food/minerals/energy/research on your first planets carefully to optimize the path that your empire is taking. There are meaningful choices on the tiles that you will manage (whether to enhance them or bulldoze them), along with some basic base-placement mechanics.+Your empire is run by individuals at this point; the leaders of your empire are its governors, scientists, admirals, and generals. Choosing the right individual for the job is well-done, and you do get to know certain admirals or governors as their stories progress.+Ship design is meaningful and there are at least a few choices you'll need to pursue; the weaponry breaks down into energy/mass drivers/missiles early on, and the distinction does matter against the various types of defenses in the game (shields/armor, and there balance thereof.)Mid-Game:+Sectors are a feature that you are required to use as your empire grows; you have a core segment of planets that you are allowed to manage, while you will need to create independent administrative sectors to manage your planets in excess of the limit.-Finding the right balance with sectors can be difficult, and unintuitive; you'll often face factions wanting independence for their sectors.+Sectors reduce the amount of micromanagement that you have to do for a given set of planets; you can assign priorities, and a few constraints, and generally your sectors will execute on this reasonably well; your sectors can be lead by a governor who confers benefits or penalties to his administrative zone based on his traits.+/- Population management becomes more complex at this point; you may have multiple species in your empire, with different ethos and ideas and preferences. If you like the detail of assigning the correct populations to the correct tasks on your planets, this is pretty enjoyable. For many, it's an opaque exercise in micro-managing.+/- At this point in the game you've likely met all the surrounding empires, and have probably found a few that will just dislike you no matter what.+The ways in which you can interact with unfriendly empires are fairly interesting; you can conquer them and try to assimilate their populations, or you can ""liberate"" their worlds to force their newly formed government to adopt your ethos and outlook.+Warfare is the most interesting at this stage in the game; managing your fleets to create the right fighting force to face down threats makes all the difference; a 1k-strong fleet can easily beat a 2k-strong fleet if it's built to counter the stronger fleet.+The research system shines at this point in the game, as well; you generally select techs based on a 'card' system - you have 3+ techs to choose to research in three different areas.Late-Game:+Generally, alliances have formed and Federations (cooperative governments) have assembled at this point in the game. You as a player have formed a federation or are a member of an alliance, and will be facing off similiarly-sized groups of alien nations.-The nuance of combat breaks down, somewhat, at this point; blobbing large fleets tends to be more important than composition (though it can still matter.)-The path to victory is something of a slog a this point; that's not to say that it's not still interesting, but you'll find yourself doing many of the same things for decades on end.+Late game technologies offer interesting, 'dangerous' choices - research that represents a fundamental societal shift that could threaten your empire.+Late game crises occur at this point in the game; these are large existential threats to the galaxy as a whole, that generally require a huge amount of resources to defeat. While these threats are different in flavor, they are mechanically similar.Other Notes:+The soundtrack is amazing; think Interstellar and Star Wars.+The graphics are good. Most objects are done with good detail, the animated portraits for races are great.+There is a significant amount of replayability in this game.+There is even more replayability through mods, which are out in droves at this point.Things I want to See:-Right now, Corvettes are just... overpowered. Defensively-built evasion fleets with some point defence just win. Destroyers and Cruisers need a buff.-Fire control on one's fleets leaves a lot to be desired; if I have 5 battleships, they'll focus fire a single corvette when they could kill 1 corvette each with their available weaponry in a single volley.Summary:I recommend this game, though there are points that become tedious or unfun at times. This is one of the best representations of a 4x/Grand strategy in space that I've ever played, even with its flaws.			"

												Could have been good, but it is not that great.The early game is the very strong part of the game. You really try to get any bonus. Exploring is really intense. You are always looking out for a good planet to colonize and you try to get any bonus by investigating every anomaly. There are many different anomalies out there, but not enough for a second game session or for a long game on a big map.When you overcome all the other equal starting empires, there is no real threat (except for some special events), because the ancient empires are passive and you can engage them, when you are really ready to fight them.Also the K.I. is really bad in wars. Allied empires only support you. They don't really try to make any own moves, they only follow your fleet.The Battles look great in the early game, when your fleets are small. But when the fleets get bigger, the game will stutter. No matter how good your PC is, at some point your game will stutter. During war you don't have many possibilities, you only have the decisions to send your ships in the right moment in. Everything else is decided by your ship layout and amount of ships.I also had many really nasty bugs. For example my main fleet engaged the enemy main fleet, but they were both too far away from each other to shoot at each other. So nothing happened. I was only able to send in new fleets from behind to engage them. Luckily I was strong enough to build up a fleet which was able to destroy the enemy fleet. Really this was the worst bug ever.So listen to my advice and wait! Don't buy it yet. It still has many bugs. And wait until it is cheaper and until Paradox finishes this game with some more DLCs.

												I tried to like Stellaris, I truly did. However, all things considered, the Ankle deep diplomacy, the imbalanced poorly executed  civilization management system, the one sided incredibly overpowered AI, all that Stellaris boils down to is a paper thin pretty picture. The exploration is fantastic, but it ends there. as soon as you have the misfortune of encountering another intelligent society, kiss your pretty little empire good-bye.All AI races within the game follow no logical pattern. They will declare war on you at the drop of a hat no matter your current relationship with them while roundly rejecting every single attempt you may make at interaction. Would you like to form an alliance? +180 opinion towards you? NOPE, rejected. Trade technology for the greater good of us both? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Can we at least trade minerals? NO, UNACCEPTABLE! Then you get invaded by an empire with a 2 planet economy matching you 1:1 for production power. My breaking point was spending over 100 years as a technological isolationist, I was CONSTANTLY under attack by everyone and their dog. Never took land (because that is a negative influence bonus) just defended myself like the nerd in high school. Finally manage to get 4 neighboring powers to over 200+ opinion of me, and you know what they did? Allied to the bug people to my flank who have attacked THEM before and then, even with the fact that alliances must VOTE for a war, they raise their guns and JOIN FORCES against me.Avoid this game at all costs, it's all show and zero real initiative or effort. Do what I didn't and save your money for a game that has earned it. "

												endgame crisis always tends to show up just a moments after i loose my most powerful fleets fighting ancient empires. Ironman mode is kind annoying but you can disable it.gameplay wise, research is wisely done. you don't get a regular tree like always do, you have 3 categories, and have a random 3 technologies (of course, no endgame technologies on start, you need to progress) to choose from.You can regain technology from destroyed enemy ships, but not magically have 100% working tech from a derelict, but it gives X% of progression in that technology. That helps a lot if normally the technology isn't available for your empire.next up, you have economy, is fair and simple, however, in the lategame, it seems that you need to focus on energy worlds more than ever, to upkeep your big empire. military wise, you have different weapons and defence modules, that allow you to meet different enemies with different loadouts. Although, long range weapons are somehow more effective than anything else.now, we go to politics. you have many political systems to choose from, each having own rules regarding policies your empire allows and bans. you can adjust them manually later on too. Your populace dislikes orbital bombardment that can hurt people? You may ban this! of course this limits your fleet operations, but hey, people ARE happier.also, politics empire wide are also very developed. forget warmongering through the galaxy 100% of the time. now you need to plan your wars and chip off your enemies little by little, or whole, if you are strong enough. you can also liberate their planets to assimilate them later, to reduce happiness penalties. Many deals and trades to be done as well.next up, we have species. There is really so many you can't cover them all. you can set them as you like, with special traits, and characteristics, you want them to be fanatical xenophobes? no problem. want them to love all that alien? go ahead. want to make your populace that cannot function properly without slaves? go ahead. 3 warp drive methods, you can play with one enabled, or all 3. but i dont like it when people use different technologies for warp, its harder to catch their fleets.Now, you need to explore your galaxy, meet special events, find space creatures hostile and neutral alike, scan your planets.Its much more to this game i've forgot to mention for sure, but its a very nicely done game. I recommend. My hours add up :)			"

There are 10 options to be enemies with other empires and a single option to be friendly, maybe two.Needs ~4 more DLCs and a complete rebalance to be good, but the potential is there.			"

												  I preordered Stellaris and was really looking forward to the game.  There are some thing Stellaris is doing well, such as such as intesting ethic and government system, some interesting races and technologies,  decent ship designer and a few of the events are fun. However, there are issues with the execution of some mechanics that other reviewers have already talked about.   In addition, I love big space games have one continous map are at most a few sections (e.g., Endless Space, Gal. Civ 3, etc.). However, in Stellaris, the exploration, scientist planet mapping and having a construction unit build mines, etc. 150-1000 many times turns Steallaris into a boring experience.  These miniature chunks of space in all seem identical and give nothin of the feel of being in outer space like other games of the same genre, which have beter map visuals on single map of the same or larger size than the entirety of Stellaris overall map.    Also, having to repeat the cycle for 150-1000 minimaps for each of these individually gets extremely tedious.  I know all grand stategies such as Paradox's (own them all) have that to some level to add depth and realism, but the game as it is I now I cannot reommend it.			"

												Oh boy, Paradox pulled a Sword of the Stars 2 release again!It's buggy, unoptimized, and many features are missing.The inital release version has massive slowdowns late game, undefeatable random encounter enemy due to bugs, and game exploits like invincible corvettes and slavery.A major patch just released, and it crippled all AI empires and player's auto-managed systems by causing them to not build any buildings, which made very boring games as enemy empires just sit there and do nothing.The bugs will probably be fixed and game mechanics balanced in a year or so, by that time you can probably pick it up from the bargin bin, just like SOTS2.

												I wanted to like this game. I tried playing it for more than 300 hours of game time. What I found was the AI is beyond bad. It mirrors what you do and always ends up just somehow ""before you take a planet, it takes a planet:, ""before you build a base, it builds a base"" always just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥around to make it annoying rather than fun on any level. It somehow raises fleet sizes that it cannot possibly support in energy credits or otherwise. The diplomacy is really really really poor.Multiplayer - what multiplayer? The few games that are out there state tags such as ALL Welcome and then routinely deny access to the game. Not ALL welcome apparently.And as so many others have mentioned - the warscore thing and forced truce is ridiculous!No matter how many save games, reloads, etc - this game had potential and the AI is just plain poor - in diplomacy, in AI cheats to fleet size and ability to take planets, in battles. It is a long winded game that goes nowhere and I wouldnt recommend it to anyone.Very disappointed.			"

												Let me start off by saying that the diplomacy is terrible. In two playthroughs I have yet to be allowed to join in an alliance with anyone. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but I just can't get closer than -40 acceptance of letting me join. So when 2 different alliances delcare war on my only vassal, I can't do anything.I mean it seems like for me to be able to join, the alliens have to have the same traits/opinions that I do. Yet for the others, it almost doesn't matter. Except for an alliance that was formed by 5 piece loving empires, which was a cool touch. It's almost impossible to get a good trade deal, unless the other empire suggest it. I mean I just want civilian access but I just can never get it.My sectors are stupid on how they build a planet, I'd rather manage everything myself. I can't seem to be able to build up enough influence to intergrate my vassal, so I don't get anything from them. They can't do anything without me either.There are no trade lines, so I can't trade anything from planet to planet to help if I'm missing something (ie food) which sucks. If there were trade lines, I could also go after them with my fleets, which would help when I'm weaker.All in all, wait to get this game, because the more I play this, the more frustrated that I get. It starts really good at first, then it just, shows it's weaknesses hours into the game. Hopefully this will get better after nerfs and patches.			"

I've played other Space 4X and they never hit the mark Master of Orion 2 did.  Galatic Civililzation was deep, but never held my interest.  If you have never played a Paradox game before, know that this one uses the best of hte last 3 games released. Concepts from Europa Unversalis IV and Crusader Kings 2 are woven into this 4X and it works.  Multiplayer works fantastic, and it is all i've played. I have high expectations for the DLC, I doubt Paradox will let me down.			"

												Stellaris is a beautiful 4X strategy game set in space. From the graphics to the soundtrack, it's artistically superb. When I first launched the game, I found myself staring at the scenery and units in amazement just as I did with Witcher 3. The detail that went into the games presentation is astounding. Once you overcome your wonder and delight enough to actually start playing, you truly feel as though you're at the helm of a fledgling interstellar empire taking its first steps into space. You're excited, and you're curious. If you're like me when you set up your first game, you'll make sure to choose humanity as your race, and purposely pay no attention to the appearances or descriptions of any other: you'll want to be surprised. As your first survey ship leaves your home system, you'll wonder what awaits it. You know you're not alone, but where are they, and what're they like? The immense depth you've already seen so far has inspired the highest expectations in you. You know only that they'll be interesting and unique. Suffice to say, you won't soon find yourself disappointed, but I won't spoil it for you.As the game progresses, you might find that Stellaris isn't a game without problems. The signature Paradox Warscore system throttles progress through conquest, leaving the game's pace best suited for only the very most patient gamer. Luckily a few campaigns and a handful of conquered systems later, you'll find more efficient strategies for handling warscore, and the pace will seem more reasonable. There's three beginning methods of propulsion to choose from in the game, such as warp, and those other methods can be frustrating to counter. Your adversary may bypass your border defenses entirely and appear instantaneously at the center of your empire, where it could theoretically raid you with impunity, attacking your stations then moving onto the next system before your warp ships had the chance to respond to the first. This isn't a circumstance in which there's no answer, but it can and will be frustrating, especially at first. Once you do catch up with the attacking fleet, its likely to simply retreat rather than allow you to destroy it. Makes sense, but it also makes annoying. You're gonna be chasing fleets of raiders around the galaxy before you know it: They attack, you intercept, they retreat, they attack, you intercept, they retreat, ad infinitum, or so it might sometimes seem.Is Stellaris worth it? Yes, absolutely, beyond any doubt. Will the mechanics designed to artificially lengthen and otherwise forcefully shape the game frustrate you at times? Yes, absolutely, beyond any doubt. Buy Stellaris now, and envelop yourself with the beauty and elegance, the depth and wonder, the mundane and vexation. Be amazed. Be annoyed. "

												5/10+ Massive galaxy+ Good race creation+ Multiple FTL technologies+ Side mission + Randomised Tech choices------------------------------ Poor late game- Passive game play (even with large control of planets)- Only 4 class assult ships- Poor diplomecy choices- Conquered races takes time to integrate  (+- 10 - 1000 months which is 5 min to 2 hours at max game speed)Stellaries is a fun game with a high diverse of races to pick and create yourself, interesting side missions and side tech to collect but playing only for a few hours the game tends to slow down after all races have establisted their borders and spaces betweem each other the game then goes on a marathon of alliences and federations (which is cool). A massive scaled game with a randomised tech makes each game plays differently and  interesting, but it laks a massive tech tree to keep the game going, once reaching mid late game (I found myselft only giving +%% to already tech) which is boring. Turning to warfare the game has a pretty cool system placed in tirms of conquer and being conquered. Conquering other planets and space is done by warpoints and only then you can integrate the conquered race into your empire (which takes time to get that option plus more time for the procces to do so) the bigger the race the longer it takes.I feel that stellaries would of been a game of the year if they had brought in same experist to advise them on different techs, biology, planets and so forth. As I can see same of the technologies is pretty standerd and nothing really speciel. MMO 2 still have some unique species traits I've seen so far and a pretty high weapon base tech. over here is it just Kinetic. Missles and Lasers ( Level I, II, III, IV, V, VI)			"

The 'empire' list is not useful and murky. Want to move an embassy? ugh.4) The system view is mostly useless but is the default view (note how galaxy view has the close view button). With a few context menus you wouldn't need it at all.5) Automation of the system surveying and construction. While the sectors can handle it, you can't give them ships and having them build ships leads to odd results of ownership (may be a bug)6) The help button is just a link to the wiki. Instead of a manual or in-game info (like the civpedia in civ) it links to an external website that is already out of date and incomplete, like all the other paradox wikis.7) In general, weak feedback to the player to understand what is going on in terms of warfare8) Can't see what pop is on a colony ship9) all the fun and interesting events stop mid game and things get boring.Things I'd like to see:1) zooming into and out of system view with the scroll wheel.Game play problems:1) Weak diplomacy and trading with other empires2) Weak internal management. I think i had 2 or 3 factions ever. Since I had maxed resources it was easy to just click a few buttons to make them go away forever. Planets never ask for anything.3) Not sure what the AI does during a war but it doesn't seem to do anything useful.

												<title>Stellaris: A case of player mistreatment</title><h1>Introduction</h2><p>This game, while quite inventive, is also a huge burden on the player. It dose not let the player make any kind of long-term or even short-term strategy, as well as as making the game have a learning curve so steep it is almost unfair to the player.</p> <h2>Tech♥♥♥♥♥Hold-em</h2><p>On one hand, the idea of researching multiple techs in dissparate area is a great idea, not only forcing the player to build infestructure in all three areas, it also adds depth in how the player must choose his priorities in three lists, instead of just one. The player can choose to focus on one of them, or try to balence all three, each with their own array of benifits, so some empires will need some trees more than others. However, while games like <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/app/261470/"">Distant Worlds: Universe</a> have a complete skill tree for all three areas, stellaris instead decides to just give you a set of three or four technologies picked from your pile of possible techs to research. There is no way to plan ahead or even to check what postrequisets there are. Just what you are delt each time.</p><h3>It's a strange, yet frustrating Galexy</h3><p>Much like on other games of this type, there is a variety of hospitable and inhospitable planets, with the former commong a number of different biomes. While you can only settle some of them at the begging, more become availible with technology(Which, again, is delt randomly). However, there are waaaaay to few habitable planets, and even fewer that you can actually settle in the early game. Other than settling planets, you can also claim territory by building fronteir outposts, which are very expensive. And remember: you can only build in terrirtory you have actually claimed with one of these two structures. This is combined with how the inhopitable planets that produce resources are not as common as they should be, and when they do come up, they are not very productive.This, combined with the AI(which I will get to in a bit), making expansion and resource collection way to difficult.</p><h4>Bits of S@@t</h4><p>The resourse system is far too simplisic. You really only have three: influence, minerals, and energy(credits). You minerals and energy with buildings, energy keeps things running, minerals build new crap. The influence system is kind of nice, since it can be used for a number of things, and actaully feels inherently valuable. Yes, I now there are strategic resourses, but in my time with the game, I found barely any.</p><h5>The AI is swift and brutal</h5><p>All the other stuff is not that bad, and even if they were the only issues, I would probably get a lot more fun out of it.. But, they have their effets compounded here. Even on low difficulty, the AI is way to fast. By the time you build your third outpost, they will already have a military you could not possibly compete with.

												Pros: The first few hours in-game were amazing since they felt like those star trek TNG episodes in-which the crew gets to find a new discovery or a new world. The Visuals in Stellaris are nice enough, when you get too close to a planet though the illusion fail. Player camera and controls are decent enough. Customizable ships and races are fun to make. A Vibrant modding community.Cons: A glorified DLC factory with no fair price for a Season Pass, giving users a feeling of being led by the nose and made into fools. The game-play turns stale and repetitive after a while and the game turns into a boring lump of GB on your HDD. Game-play balance issues. Violent content segmentation – Features that are a normal part of the Classical 4X game like Dyson spheres, ring worlds or exotic life forms(e.g. The reason we love Sci-Fi) are being cut off the game and sold separately – Giving the feel of a “Freemium” game to a fully paid and mostly single-player game. This marketing direction and approach is loathsome and corrupt and is taking advantage of a younger crowed who hadn't the chance to experience games like Moo2 or Star-Control 2 in their time of release – Old school gamers from the 80's know exactly what i'm talking about. Conclusions:Stellaris is a good example of how a development team can destroy a good game with out any intervention by EA. ;)On basis of Game-play Longevity and Marketing Approach I can not condone Paradox's nor can I support Stellaris with my vote.This game that I very much wanted to enjoy - gets two thumbs down.Save your money for a development team that will respect you, If you have to buy something then go buy The Universim.

												This is a GOOD game not brill, not packed with content. With this classic 4X games you can enjoy yourself but this game and its content at release its not really enough for a 4X game. If you wanna wait and see if PARADOX release some future content which they probs will thats up to you but if you wanna give this game a chace go and buy it.			"

												I give this thumbs down because I disagree with Paradox policy of releasing unfinished games (content missing, bugs, stability problems and lack of polishing). In Stellaris this becomes abundantly clear when you reach latter mid game.To make this clear, I do like DLCs when they are done right. Example of a good game: Release a finished game that can stand on its own without months of hotfixing. After this release DLC every 6 months or so with content worth ~20e.I really dislike the EU4/CK2 model.			"

												As a fan of PDX's previous grand strategies I was slightly disappointed that Stellaris leaned more to 4X than GS, but I had then realised something. They fixed all the problems I had with 4X games. 4X games tended to become too much micro and tedious in the late game because of the amount of endless turns due to your empire/fleet sizes that you knew 100% you'd win every battle with. It's why I absolutely hate turn-based 4X games now because they always boil down to this. Stellaris takes aspects of GS with combat, it's more about building counters and overall battle strategy than micro managing each decision of a ship, this is not a RTS, and doing that in 4X never made sense to me like in Masters of Orion. It would be impossible to do that in Stellaris because the scale of wars and battles you fight are enormous compared to typical 4X. Not just that, but they made it challenging, every 4X around the end of mid-game you've basically become impossible to stop, where as in Stellaris there are many events that can occur that completely upsets the galactic balance, it keeps a campaign fresh and unpredictable. The amount of mechanics at play in Stellaris is more rich and deep than any other space 4X, none compare to its depth, and the innovated research/tech system is a welcome changing since in other 4X games you just railroad obvious tech trees and tech/research is very stale in those games - not the case in Stellaris, tech/research is not always the same each game, plus your science ships can find new tech too, it gives that element of sci-fi from Star Trek. I have never seen a 4X game that has the diplomacy depth than Stellaris does, all other 4X games are simply ""declare war"", ""surrender"", ""give me money"". Stellaris fortunately added more depth, but still not the amount you'd expect from a PDX grand strategy like Stellaris.If you are a 4X fan you'd like Stellaris, if you are a grand strategy fan it's not 100% that, but they're working to make it more of a grand strategy by improving diplomancy to a standard it is in their other games. The developer continuously support and improve their games for years and Stellaris has a bright future.			"

												Having never played one of Paradox's grand strategy games, I approached this with hesitation. It's definitely more approachable than most of their other games. If you're a sci-fi fan, you owe it to yourself to invest some time into this game. Upcoming updates from the absurdly dedicated developers, as well as the surprisingly active modding community will likely ensure this game has life for years to come.			"

												This game is absolutely stellar. Pun intended. I do have some... issues... with the terreforming system, and which planets are habitable vs not, but overall, Stellaris is stunningly beautiful, extremely well-crafted, and definitely gives you that ""Just... ONE... MORE... TURN..."" feel of a good 4x game. Interesting given that it isn't in fact turn-based, but it really does give that feeling. If you enjoy 4x games, then this is the game for you. The ship designer is great fun, and actually allows you to focus ships on different combat roles, such as carrier operations, defense, assault, support, etc; the management system is complex, but not overly so, and the gameplay is absolutely top-notch. Well worth the 40 bucks, if you ask me.			"

												After playing 11 hours now, to me this is closest to Sins of a Solar Empire except with a lowered initial stress/panic level that too many things are happening at once in realtime.  This combines the realtime aspect, the more real 3d effect missing from others like Galactic Civ and Distant Words, but it has far more gradual 4x feel to it and I think hits a really quite perfect mix. So I would say it's 40% Sins, (realtime 3D, very little automation)20% Distant Worlds, (It does have a live feel to it, that the universe is alive, and it's HUGE, and freedom to go wherever, not on a path)20% standard 4X, (alot of exploration, alot of setting up cities, planets, mining, juggleing stuff)20% Galactiv Civ genre. (Only in in the basic premise really, and the managing of planets) Overall I'd rate it so far as 85%However, there are things that bug me a bit.I don't like the separation of the solar system view and then jump to galaxy. When in a solar systems, I'd like to have a better visual sense of the galaxy around me as opposed to feeling like I'm in a closed room. A smoother transition between the two, or a seamless transition would make this game feel much much more immersive.Doesn't seem like anything can be automated as far as scouting ships, fighting things, etc. This is good and bad, and so far has been good, but I can see where it might get out of hand as it gets much larger (and it will)Hard to tell what to research next, as far as I can tell there's no ""This leads to..."" type explanation of new tech. When jumping into a solar system, the amount of icons can be overwhelming to quickly see what is happening.There's no ""easy"" mode, just normal, hard and insane. I was quickly surround in a normal game by systems and races I simply could not overcome so my game just sort of ended because I couldn't expland or jump or explore new systems.Visually it would have been nice for the planets to revolve around the sun. Again, to just bring a little more life to the whole thing instead of feeling like a static board game.			"

												Game start is incredible with all the discoveries, the promise of all the mysteries ahead, the own survival or extinction. Then you keep growing and you find some troubles here and there, resources, a big guy closeby attacking you. Then you survive and you have been already been playing for 5-10 hours and you are quite big already. You don't have many empires around  that match your force. You keep researching, you keep getting minerals, a few more colonies here and there.At some point it starts to get quite boring. There are no more unexpected anomalies or discoveries and it is just more and more research and growing a fleet that you don't really need anymore. There is no much to contruct either and also no much to research. There is no incentive to stay inside your own frontiers as there is nothing else to do and going outside will get you slowly against most people around you that will start to fear you and get a huge penalty to your relations.The limit on leaders is ridiculously small. I am atm with 15 leaders and i have to keep rejecting new ones and running now with only one wandering scientist for a pretty big empire and don't even have space for a general for invasions.The start was absolutely awesome. I enjoyed it tremendously and i was surprised of how good the game was. But as it advances more and more it severely lacks content and ends being plainly boring.

												I'm only 2 and a half hours in at the time of writing this review but from the little I've played so far I already know this game is awesome. I've tried getting into 4X games in the past and never had the patience for them with their overly complicated UI and vague tutorials. However, Stellaris makes everything so clear and easy to understand with a tutorial system that is spot on.I can see myself clocking up thousands of hours playing this!Update: 39 Hours in - Even without the already large and ever growing list of mods, this game has so much variety in the way you can play and what kind of experiene you can get out of it. For example, you can opt to go in as a race that has a big emphasis on military and a determination to dominate the galaxy, entering into conflict at every opportunity, or you can play as a highly peaceful race, looking to form friendships and alliances with other races. The first style gives you an exciting, action packed and tense experience, whereas the latter choice gives you a more relaxed, sit back and relax game. This is especially so when you choose which races will appear in your game, choosing to lock in friendly races that you have designed.At this stage my only gripe is that I feel that Frontier Outposts costing 1 influence point a month is an annoyance that I don't feel is necessary, especially as each outpost already cost a hefty amount of influence to build in the first place. However, there is already a mod that removes this.			"

												Placeholder review.I'm a few hours in but I already see this will entertain me for hundred of hours. It's not CK2, it's not EUIV (both great games by paradox), the only thing they share is that they are grand strategy games. So far I noticed that in this game there is a lot less idle time, while in CK2 or EUIV sometimes you have to wait some time to do things, here you can always be doing something, either exploring, building, fighting or managing your fleets and planets. I imagine that if thats early game, it only gets more complex and challenging later.So it's a obvious positive review from me.Edit: This game is not as deep as other paradox games, still very fun to play.Maybe this is an advantage in multiplayer, makes the game flow without much of a hassle.Multiplayer works very well, haven't had a problem so far playing 2 to 4 players games.

												I can't stop playing. Help. I got sores on my♥♥♥♥♥Realtak...Pros:- Random Systems, Peoples, and Ethics makes for very interesting developments- Technology research system makes sure that two races never have the same technologies (Thus making research treaties very useful)- Different FTL modes for empires allows players to find their favorite way to play- Thoughtful UI makes the game easy and quick to move around the game world once you've figured it out- No Casus Bellis. A simple ""I war you"" is good enough, because in space you don't need a reason- Surprisingly approachable for a Paradox game- Game properly simulates that feeling of discoveryCons:- Diplomacy is pretty rusty right now, especially trading- Espionage is literally nonexistant, but will probably be added with DLC (Possibly as part of the free features?)- Some mechanics are not disclosed by the tutorial, leaving you to find them yourself- The AI doesn't always act within it's ethics IE Pacifists are oddly aggressive and seem to be perfectly fine with being in a war as long as it didn't start it- Ship pathing is wonky, sometimesBottom Line: The game is a rich and fun 4x game that hits a lot of good points. In addition, it has a lot of what makes Paradox games fun: The ability to commit horrible atrocities for no good reason other than you're not making that extra +1 Mineral per month.			"

												Pure epicness. If you've been looking for an experience that enables you to control massive interstellar empires and to communicate with aliens, then look no further.This game is extremly rich. So rich in content and attention grabbing decisions that I played for 2 hours, thinking I had just spent a couple of minutes.If you have work or need to sleep for the next day, I suggest you set an alarm, because you'll be too ingrossed in the game to realize that you were just fired from your job for having missed 5 days of work.EDIT: I have to admit that the sector portion of the game needs some major fixing. when i give a planet to a sector it usually never upgrades to administrative. Also it needs to upgrade spaceports.Also their should be an option to make a fleet patrol your empire (maybe reducing the maintenance by half). having to micromanage fleets so much is annoying: at war, the AI always sends a lot of mini fleets, making it hard to intercept them all. Also, they attack planets and spaceports in mass, but the moment you arrive with your fleet, they leave or flee... it's like guerrilla warfare in your own territory which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I had to split my main fleet in so many chunks that managing them all and having them each intercept was pure hell. Although, i have to admit, it was quite fun (since i was at war by myself against a whole federation, it's normal that they have split fleets).Anyway, Awesome game that needs a lot of tweeks. Limitless potential, even more so with all the workshop support (1 day in and there were multiple awesome mods!!).			"

												Paradox has combined three of my favorite games into one product:Moo, Civ and EU4 all rolled into one.  A future updating adding more tactics during battle would be great, but aside from that- graphics are good, music is good, customization options seem plentiful.No game breaking bugs so far.All we need is Hearts of Iron 4, and Bannerlord, THEN the summer of gaming is ready to begin.

												My friends, this game delivers, deliciously so.This is the 4X game you've been waiting for. Try it for yourself and if you think it's an awesome game already just wait until the updates start popping out as the developers start to address the most common complaints and the player-suggested features.Improved gameplay, newer features and depthness makes this a very promising title. I expect the developers to expand it beyond the horizon in the next few years [both through free updates and payed DLCs] as usual in the big Paradox Interactive titles (if you know anything about the legacy of Crusader Kings II and Europa Universalis IV you know what I'm talking about).Simply put: It has a great ambiance, replayability, music and complexity (although not as complex as Crusader Kings II, it's a bit more straighforward but still has somewhat of a learning curve for new players). It's a joy to discover the procedurally generated universe.			"

Posted: May 12, 2016
												My First Review: A Space StoryI would first like to specify that my hours played aren't necessarily a reflection of actual play time, as I spend a lot of it alt-tabbed talking to people.That said, I feel this was one of the first new games in some time to really capture my attention in an altogether interesting and enjoyable manner. It's one of the first new games in months that I've enjoyed enough to just sit down and play it, without needing a movie or TV show in the background to help keep my interest. The quality of the experience is true Paradox fashion, if you've played any of their other games, with enough content and new events popping up to keep you wanting to explore. The game on the whole is intuitive, with informative tutorials in general (assuming you've ever played any kind of strategy game before), and a difficulty system that doesn't hold your hand, but yet doesn't murder you if you play smart.STATS GRAPHICS (6/10): It's a 4x space game, not the next Battlefield, so you shouldn't expect hyperrealistic, mind-bendingly awesome graphics. However, they are good enough to get the job done, to immerse you in the game, and to be clear at every opportunity. You can always tell what's going on, and what you need to see. SOUND (8/10): The music is good enough that I've been able to have it playing in the background the entire time I'm playing without any real issues. It has yet to grate on me like so many other grand strategy game soundtracks, and is ambient enough to often not even be noticeable. Sound effects are reasonable enough. They get the job done in spite of not being spectacular. The limited spoken dialogue is workable, if not spectacular. AI (8/10): In a general sense, the AI in this game is exceptionally well put together. Personalities really do have an effect on what alien civilizations do and accept; for example, isolationist xenophobes will huddle away and try their best to just stay out of everyone's business, while fanatical evangelists will attempt to spread their faith at any cost. On a smaller scale, however, the AI does have some important drawbacks typical of AI in games like these. Occasional fleet movements that make no sense, enemy fleets may refuse to engage an inferior fleet simply because they're waiting to build a new ship, etc. The positives outweigh the drawbacks here, especially since the drawbacks are typical of most such games. GAMEPLAY (7.5/10): The gameplay in general is intuitive, easy to learn (if often hard to master without getting trounced), and simple yet addictive. This is one of those ""Just one more turn"" kinds of games, where you may find yourself wanting to play for an hour, before looking at the clock and realizing you've been playing for three. Gameplay is varied, different ideologies encourage completely different play styles, and new events and questlines open up on a regular basis. That said, this is a game that requires patience; like any Paradox game, you shouldn't expect to be doing something every second you're playing the game. Sometimes you will just be speeding the time along waiting for things to finish, but I've found that to be little more than a minor niggle. TECHNICAL (6.5/10): Bugs. Quite a few upon release, but getting eaten quite quickly, too. This score will likely be revised in the near future, but for now, there ARE some that will break questlines, or even your entire game. Thankfully, Paradox is keeping tabs on it and has released two hotfixes within two days of release, so it's only a matter of time.OVERALL RATING: 7.5/10Overall, a good game for the money, that will give any grand strategy, 4x strategy, or sci-fi lover plenty of hours of enjoyment. Just don't be surprised when it takes 5 DLC releases to be bumped up to a 9/10.			"

												Another real-time grand strategy game from Paradox Interactive, this time in a fictional sci-fi setting instead of a historical one. Has some fantastic customization options for player-made factions. The soundtrack and art design are great, and showcase some really commendable writing. The UI is lightyears ahead of previous Paradox strategy titles. The tutorial is also quite good. Combat is still fairly basic but is made more engaging by the custom ship designer. Unfortunately, there are some conspicuous holes in the game (diplomacy, victory conditions), that given Paradox's track record, will probably only be filled in bits and pieces by overpriced DLC.Still, there is a fantastic base to work with here and I have high hopes that, given time and further development, this game could easily become a 8/10. It has quickly become my favorite PI game and I can recommend it in its current state to fans of science fiction and/or grand strategy games.			"

												Patch 1.3 resolved one of the main frustrations, which improved the vanilla game immensely.Selecting some decent mods for the game makes it a cut above the genre...my guess is that certain mods will become unnecessary later on if the game is updated and patched up (fleet behaviour, ship balance, economic balance, sector management).The game does have some novel aspects (such as genetically altering your population species), and I would hope that either the devs or modders take these further (e.g. Don't like your troublesome neighbours?  Unleash a disease on them to genetically alter them to be fugly).V1.03 and modded up, gets HG's fast food voucher of the week and a big thumbs up.I might mention, in my current campaign I'm fighting a series of wars against the evil forces of giant floating blobber monsters, and the flying monkey dudes from the Wizard of Oz...that alone was value for money.

												Having never played one of Paradox's grand strategy games, I approached this with hesitation. It's definitely more approachable than most of their other games. If you're a sci-fi fan, you owe it to yourself to invest some time into this game. Upcoming updates from the absurdly dedicated developers, as well as the surprisingly active modding community will likely ensure this game has life for years to come.			"

												Edited on 18th MayI finally crushed the Fallen Empire with barely any lose due to their reverse-engineered Tychon Lance and few other techs.The thing is you can't bombard them or any planet into oblivion...And the late game invading alien is not at all terrifying, I prepared all the fleet for them, only to face some ramnents of an invaders. Even then, their plenet is forever immortal that i neet to station some ships to keep bombing it.I wish to annihilate planets since I am running on massive deficit energy credit to fund my massive high- tech fleet. I had thought it'would take some significant lose against the renewed Fallen Fleet, but no, their number stayed as low as the last time i fought them while I boost new fleet within 40 years.This is stupid...PreviouslyWe were once small nations, restricted to a single planet. Discover of proper void craft technology and potential in the vastness of space enable us to move past petty conflicts. We form socio-economic and political union of Human Socialist Republic. The journey began with a small step limited to our sytem and nearby stars.Every exploration was full of danger and mystery; some were daunting, and some filled us with hope of greatness. Our first confirmed sentinent alien life form brought us fear, anxiety mixed with excitement. Yet it also expanded our horizon. We were lucky that our extended olive branches were responded in kind. Diplomatic relation were formed, exchanges were made with agreement favourable to both parties.But what truely changed us was not this wondrous relationship, neither were our growing Empire and brother species, rather the sound of War.Our growing might was first utilized in an opportuned strike against our failing rival; the Associate of Stars, their responds were crushed, and their planets conquered by another of their enemies. We grew confidence, and soon the mighty navy was once again utilized to pacify groups of small rivals.With numerous vallasages, we turned into an influential Empire of the known galaxy. Benevolence we were, our splendor knew no bound, so was techological knowledge and vast number of fleets. For a moment, we were the greatest empire.That is....untill we met them.The Fallen...As our border expanded, one of our expenitory ship journeyed into the forbidden part of the galaxy. Home to the species once conquered with galaxy before we ever gained sentinent. Their fleet while incomparable to eons past till outmatched and outnumbered us. Twice, we were declared war, and twice we lost. Our home world and numerous others were crushed in the first conflict. Humiliated beyond belief; our leaders rebuilt the fleet into an armada twice its former size. They were equipted with some of the most hi-tech available in the known space. Prepared for the next conflict they said. Surely enough, it came, but the result was not what we expected...Our fleet warped into one of their home systems the moment the mighty and arrogant Fallen Empire declared war on us; intending on annihilate any resistant. Supported by our allies, we carved out a large chunk of their forces and destroyed some of their space ports. But their resistant were fiercer than we anticipated. After months of space battle, our fleet were reduced to merely a sixth of its former size.In that instant, we once again have to bow to their unreasonable demands. Countless life were lost once again in forced abandoned colonies. We were shamed....Bur for how long?? We know defeat, but we know not to give upThe secrets of their special weapons are now ours. We are now even mightier than before, and soon the armada will be ready.			"

												Okay so I got this came about 2 weeks ago during the Steam Sale and I already have 76 hours in it which tells you how much I'm already obsessed  about it.  There's already tons of great reviews detailing all the aspects of the game so I'm going to talk about the stuff you don't hear about much.First there's three different types of faster-than-light travel. You can set the game where you can play with any of the three. Or lock it so that there is only one kind. Each form of travel requires different tactics. Second there's lots of little nuggets in this game from migrating giant trees. Anoying aliens that need your help and then start to need your help way too much. Precursor civilizations to discover. Pre sentience to uplift. Pre FTL races to conquer or to help. Third there's tons more to talk about but frankly I'd rather stop writing this review and go play Stellaris.......I have a feeling I'm going to be playing this game for a long time money well spent.At 150 hours of Play time I started a new game with a new race I created the Darzine Collective. An insectoid race Fanatical Collective and Militant. Think the Borg combined with the Bugs from Starship Troopers. They were Rapid Breeders (fast growth) and Very Adaptive. I ignored diplomacy, I ignored Tech building (researching or building them). I invaded Pre-warp races home worlds (1 machine age, 1 bronze age) Exterminating one and Enslaving another (within the first 50 turns of the game…). I was always technologically behind but always had bigger fleets that were very…. Replaceable. After battle I could scan the debris of battle to learn my enemies secretes.  Stellaris is flexible enough that I could do this and get away with it. Victory was Sweet.At 195 hours, I thought I was getting bored but then I discovered The Star Trek mod. The map is so huge… oh someone please help me………			"

												This is a Amazing Game.     9.5/10I say 9.5/10 due to needing mods to enhance some parts of the game. Many of the mods I use are graphical in nature, with only a few changing gameplay.Pros:- Very fun to play.- Many options/ diffrent ways to play.- Can be complex and make you think out your actions.- Fun storys that add to the gameplay.- Complex interactions between Empires/ Nations.- Regular support.- New Content coming out.- Great soundtrack.- No Two games are the same.- Mods.- Customization of Nations, and Species is great.- Ability to Genetically modify species in game allows for more customization.- End game threats that you can face offer great fights and sense of purpose.- Relativly easy to get into and learnMeh:- Graphics are good, but not the best in the world, does not matter to me.- Things can be a bit random at times, but that can alos be good, spices things up.Cons:- Ai allies can be bad at times, they don't help as much as they can in wars (not to say they are usless, they do hold there own and attack.)- Micromanegment can be bad for people (For me I like it, so its a pro for me.)Overall, With constant support, mods, and alot of content, Stellaris offers a great space Stratagy game experiance that you will enjoy. With a low learning curve and alot of features you can very easily find yourself sucked in.For me, this is the Space Stratagy Game that beats all others.Hope this helps you decide. "

Graphics: 7/10There is a diverse range of graphical designs for almost everything in the game, it all looks beautiful... but if you zoom in on anything too close, the game lags a lot.Performance: 8/10I personally have had no crashes or other performance issues (aside from the aformentioned lag issue), and I play on a Win10 Gaming Laptop. The game runs smoothly, saving takes very little time. 90% of the game is loaded when you start the game so loading times are next-to-nonexistant in-game.Gameplay: 9/10Incredibly fun at almost all stages of the game; incredibly diverse amount of options for replayability, roleplay.*Modding: 10/10Almost every aspect of this game can be modded; even without any concrete guides existing at this time, I was able to make a trait mod in under an hour just by reverse-engineering the text documents that make up a majority of this game's systems. Modding gameplay is as simple as copy-paste-edit, adding new 2d images as easy as saving a .dds file in GIMP. Highly moddable, great workshop support.Stellaris is a fantastic game, and the first grand strategy game by Paradox that I have been able to delve into right away, due to a combination of the in-game tutorial system and all of the developer livestreams/dev diaries leading up to the release of the game.Stellaris combines the typical ""4x"" (""eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate"") style of games like Civilization and Sins of a Solar emprie with the ""Grand Strategy"" nature of games like Eu4 and CK2 (games which Paradox made).In the early game in particular, the 4x element comes into play as you scout out your early starting position, building mining and research outposts anywhere you can within your starting territory. This point in the game has the general feel of ""dipping your toes in the water"" - you don't know what lies right next door to you at this stage. A xenophile pacifist empire who want to be your friends forever? A militarist, collectivist society who see you as a potential threat? Or is it a fallen empire - an empire centuries ahead of you, who thankfully doesn't want to expand, but should you ever cross them they will FLATTEN you?As the game moves on and you start colonising new worlds, maybe having a few small wars here and there, the Grand Strategy element comes into play. Unlike most 4x space games where you just colonise every world you see even if it isnt very good, you need to weigh your options carefully. You can only control 5 'core worlds' by default, after which you need to split up your worlds into sectors - automated administrative sectors controlled by the AI who will handle the micromanagement for you. This is good overall as it means you don't need to pause the game every five minutes to go through 20 minutes of micromanagement for every single world you own. On the other hand, it can often take the AI several in-game years (and tons of wasted resources) to get completely stable, thriving colonies working for you.There is a TON of depth to this game; the semi-random technology system means that no two playthroughs will play out exactly the same way. At the time of writing I have yet to even come across the technology for psychic powers, as I haven't played as a spiritualist empire (and they have a higher chance of accessing that technology). By changing the edicts or government type of your empire, you control whether or not yoru citizens get to have free movement throughout the empire in a utopian society free of slavery (organic or synthetic), or you can have a complete dictatorship where only your primary species has any rights, and all xeno scum are seen as fodder or worthless cattle. And anything inbetween, from nearly any scifi media out there, is possible.A final note; Stellaris is VERY much moddable. To put it in perspective, within the first 3 days of release, there was a cosmetic Warhammer 40k mod. Mods will keep this game going for years to come, I can guarantee that (not to mention Paradox has a track record of keeping up their support for grand strat games going for years as well.TL:DR; great for grand strategy fans, great for 4x fans, great for sci-fi fans.

												I have played about six hours of Stellaris at this point, and it's already earned a spot in my top 5 strategy games. The game is polished and runs very well, the gameplay is a fresh and interesting take on classic concepts, but most of all the race customization is absolutely amazing.Thye gameplay takes elements from previous Paradox games as well as other Space 4x games and blends them into an extremely enjoyable concoction. Everything is customizable. From your planets, to your fleets, to the individual ships in your fleets, to the way the ships traverse the universe, to the people flying the ships.Do you want a race of evil birds living on a desert planet that uses wormholes to isntantly warp platoons of drop troopers over enemy planets? You can do that. Want a race of ocean-dwelling, economically minded cat people who utilize hyperspace lanes a la Sins of a Solar Empire? You can do that to. The possibilities are seemingly endless. In summary, buy this game if you like Sins of a Solar Empire, any Paradox game, strategy in general...you know what? Just buy this game.			"

												Stellaris is a fun game to play and replay.Written post 1.3The music, different sounds and overall graphics set a very nice space ambiance.I find Stellaris presents us with a nice flow of things to do throughout the game and at any given stages.The new UI is much better, giving us direct access to what matters most and hiding away what doesn't.The graphics were good but are now even better (galaxy BG, combat fx).The AI seems more intelligent and the governors now make better decisions.The new way to manage/customize sectors now means less micromanagement and not the opposite.And we now have more options (!!) when creating our galaxies (exit crises or leviathans if you don't like them).This game was a meh for me at first (UI, AI, sectors and crises) and I was not going to review it as I felt conflicted about it.I'm very glad to see the devs are listening to the players and giving this game a very nice direction.Thumbs up, keep it up.

												I definitely recommend Stellaris. The setting is fantastic and it is hugely enjoyable, it offers enough depth and customisation to get you truly hooked.There are some things you need to know though:-If you're playing a large game, there's a significant amount of lag end game making it near unplayable. I believe they are working on a fix for this.-Mid game is sorely lacking.-You can cheese the game currently with vassals.-Diplomacy is lacking.-There are only 2 victory conditions: Conquest - Conquer or vassalise all factions, Domination - hold 40% of habitable planets.-Research is RNG, this is good and bad.-You can't realistically play a small empire and be able to comete with bigger ones. You have a higher chance of forming alliances but the beneifits of expanding are much greater.-Fallen empires can massively disrupt your progression.Sure the list is fairly large but the nice things Stellaris does outweigh them and Paradox will definitely work on some of them and improving the game overall. This ranks as one of the best space strategy games of all time for me.			"

												My first impressions (coming from other Paradox games like EU-IV and CK2):#1: The UI is somewhat messy. Anything new takes time to learn, but in this case I feel like there are genuine issues in Stellaris. After CK2, Paradox seemed to realize that the UI they put out is sometimes needlessly complex or even sometimes redudant in sections. Hence, EU-IV did a decent job of presenting tons of info in a simple manner, and HoI-IV, whatever its other issues, made info extremely easy to get at. Then Stellaris comes along and throws info at me from every which direction, sometimes without sufficient tool-tips (and yes, I left the beginner's stuff on and didn't skip over it). Again, part of it is just me being new, but the default map screen, the way subscreens are accessed, etc., is all a bit clunkier than the last couple games.#2: Surprisingly, then, I have to admit: the screens for setting up the game and choosing universe size and so on, are actually perfect. I can choose my empire or build a new one; if I build a new empire, I can elect to have it be forbidden from being played by the CPU; I can choose the percentage of planets that will be habitable. The options are concise, include anything I could think of that really matters that much. For one of the few games Paradox has done that has procedural generation for elements, I'm pleasantly surprised that they nailed it straight out of the gates as far as settings.#3: Early game has a lot to do, but is strangely slow. Probably just me, but I'm used to immediately having enemy countries at my door, or the Spanish Civil War to send a Panzer or two at in order to intervene. It took a decent chunk of time just to spot any other factions, though this could be luck-of-the-draw for my first game.#4: I just got this on sale, and picked up all content-adding DLC along with it. So keep in mind that my reaction is based on everything, not just the vanilla game. Overall, recommending thus far, but really have to get a dozen hours or so in on it to make any suggestion worth bothering to read.			"

												If you allow yourself to be sucked in and immersed into the beautiful game world that Stellaris provides, it will reward you with hours of engagement and fun enjoyment.+ Excellent race customization and new game setup options+ Exploration ""quests"" in the early game provide interesting and enjoyable diversions to keep you entertained while you wait for colonies to grow and things to be built.+ Incredible depth combined with a very decent user-friendly presentation.+ Presents a level of polish that exceeds humbled expectations.- Some gameplay concepts are not as easily presented as they could be. (e.g. It's not clear at first glance that placing a building on a tile on a planet surface will replace certain yields depending on the type of building until after you commit to clicking the ""Build"" button at which point the game tells you that building this building will replace the following yields). You're given the option to confirm, but a better means of communicating what the final yields would be for a tile given a certain building before clicking the Build button would be most welcome.- Cannot queue up ships or constructions to be built if you lack the resources to build them right now. This forces you to remember to build the thing you want to build later once the necessary resources are available. For instance, if you only have 50 minerals, you can't queue up a fleet of ships and have them be built as the resources come in; instead you must tend to the shipyard and build new ships as your resources come in manually.Verdict: Must BuyAny shortcomings or minor nuances that may bug you about this game will most likely be addressed in later patches given the developer's track record. In the game's current state you will still be rewarded with hours of enjoyment until then. And after the patches and DLCs come out, you'll get even more.If you like 4X games, this one is a no-brainer.			"

												I'm currently playing a science based race of Illithid bent on studying forbidden technology to bring back the old god Cthulhu.   Our seeking tentacles reach out to the vastness of race, and find many signs of the old ones.  First, we find a zealotous reptiles, obviously the servents of the Dagon and his Deep Ones.   We rival and declare war on the believers of this inferior god, and our tentacly ships invade and purge the inferiors.  This game is a great platform.  I am eager to see what sort of content they release to support it.  The events are interesting and impactful.  Many features are things i've been dreaming of in space 4x for years.  It definately itches that scratch.  Worth the asking price in a generation of 69.99$+DLC season patch AAA titles that fall into shallow buggy crap.			"

												Probably the best Space 4x I have ever played.  Are their gaps and minor weaknesses in details such as trade and civilian economy?  Certainly; however, the graphics, ease of use, tutorial system, and story which is buiulds is second to none.  Think Distant Worlds when it first came out, with more refinement, easier to use, and much better graphics, and their patches (which they call DLC even though they are free) make it better and better.  Upcoming next month with Heinlin is a complete rebalance of ships, the implementation of actual ship roles, the additiona of independent stations to provide services, and more refinement on AI pirates/creatures.  While the paid for part of it (if you choose to get it) means the addition of Guardians and further storyline expansion.Add in the workshop content and this game has it all.  Want to play in the universe of Honor Harrington?  Someone has made a good facsimilie of that already, want more events and story, again someone has made that as well.  The support of the developers, their level of communication, and the overall polish on this game is second to none.  Well worth the investment.			"

Combining the fluent grand strategy gameplay of most of the other Paradox Entertainment games with an amazing broad sci-fi setting. Making your own species and cultivating relations with others. I simply love this game, even though the mid-game ramp up is a bit of a drag sometimes, the early game and end-game vibe is amazing. I'm sure Paradox will nurture this game into a true gem of Galactic proportions. Buy it and tell your friends, family and foes, it's that good!			"

												The most approachable of Paradox' games so far. It has a very useful in-game tutorial, clear interface.It has all the ingredients you would expect from a 4X strategy game: custom race creation, huge galaxies, lots of opponents, eXploration, eXpansion, eXploitation and eXtermination. Once you start bumping in to lots of opponents, it starts to show its Paradox colors, using the racial traits to setup basic diplomatic relations and then letting you establish rivalries or embassies to influence the relation further.This is a slow steam locomotive in terms of game pace: don't expect to get into proper warfare until you are a few hours in. You need all your early game resources to expand your economy, then expand by getting more colonies and protect them with a larger navy. The neutral creatures that roam the world provide interesting targets to shoot at, and the dozens of random events keep you busy while you slowly build your empire.If you are new to 4X games or to Paradox games, this might be a good gateway drug for you.If you are still on the fence, I am doing a Let's Play series on this game, so you can just watch some gameplay to see if you would like it or not:

												I could go into a lot of detail of why this game is amazing, but I'll keep it short first: It's a great empire-building space-exploring, role-playing game.Longer review: -Create your own empire with probably 60+ species and looks (seperated into 6-7 categories i.e: Reptile, Fungoid, ect.) of all kinds to choose from-Explore and expand in a small or huge galaxy filled with all kinds of random events, planet types, other primative or technologicaly advanced civilizations, rare technology, and more-Design and specalize your own ships; though this only includes 4 sizes (Corvette, Destroyer, Cruiser, and Battleship), you have several body sections, starting from just 1 with Corvettes to 3 on BS's, which you can pick from different styles that contain different weapon and module slots to try and counter other types of ships and technology of other enemy empires. This honestly is one of my favorite features-Colonize all types and sizes of planets with help from terraforming, foreign species migration, AI/robot buildable populations...then section off your empire in self-governing sectors to form a grand empire reaching the far edges of the galaxy-Change your government polocies and even the government type to take advantage of the different bonuses with each one and disadvatages of difficult diplomacy with opposing government types and dealing with unhappy populations-War and war goals: Besides all the fun of designing ships, this is my favorite empire-building-related feature that I think I've ever seen from waging war. While starting a war, war goals must be made on the reason of the war, and completed either partially or 100% to, say, take control or liberate a group of systems from an enemy, or vassalize them, or whatever...meeting the goals is done by a viriaty of actions such as destroying fleets, taking over enemy colonized planets, ect to basically turn the war in your favor. The mroe victories you earn the more points you get for completing goals.-Work with unexpected events and anomolies that come up, some which can directly effect future events and empire modifiers depending on your choice-Fantastic soundtrack...can get repetative at times since it feels like a short loop, but still great. Would enjoy some battle or event-specific soundtracks a lot if they had them.-moreBasically, get this game if you like in-depth empire-building games and especially if you like space and exploring huge galaxies. It's not extremely complicated to get into, not like Crusader Kings 2 for example by the same company. It has a pretty good tutorial that shows you most of the basics and stuff as you progress early on. I suggest playing in Ironman mode if you want an extra challange and realistic feeling of having to deal with unexpected problems and lost wars without a long previous save to go back too (saves every month in game which is about 1-2 minutes normal game speed)			"

												The story of the Blessed Cevelli Republic,The Cevelli people began on the world known as Oros, a dry arid world in which they would build their Republic, and eventually, their powerful federation of numerous different species. The Celvelli were physically strong and also quite intelligent, they were a very spirtualistic people as well. When they ventured into the unknown, they soon found other species. They expanded their borders through being technologically superior to their neighbors, and through conquest and ethnic liberation. There were many non-Cevelli rulers of the blessed republic, and for a time they were quite prosperous, and on the slight, rather warlike, yet they only attempted to eliminate threats to their federation....The final threat was a stagnant empire, awoken, that would challenge the federations power in their region of the Galaxy. As the first attack on the Republic commenced... Worlds fell... Armies overwhelmed... But, the federation was taken by surprise. They organized their fleets into one attack to destroy the grand enemy fleet that was so technologically superior. In the months prior to the assembly of the Grand Offensive, intergalactic subspace echoes were intercepted nearing the galaxy... Something was out there, but we didn't know what... The end days of the Republic and their federation were approaching.After the grand attack commenced, thousands of lives were lost, the federation outnumbered the fallen empire 3-1, yet the entire fleet (205k vs 170k) was destroyed in a brave attempt te beat back the attackers. Worlds continued to fall, and then they showed up... The Prethoryn... Soon after, the federation was engulfed, and no more, the many species enslaved or purged. 10/10, Would get my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me by intergalactic aliens and a fallen empire.			"

												I'll be brief in my summary.Paradox makes good games. This is another in a long list produced by them such as Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings and Hearts of Iron. While this game, even on its fastest setting plays a bit slower than Europa Universalis, it can be just as fun. Empire building in space. What more can you ask for?The customization of your empire is pretty flexible. You can pick your species, traits for said species, starting weaponry, type of government, type of interstellar travel etc and all of these will impact your gameplay. There is a built in ship designer for your every need and wants. The steam workshop takes this even further.Explore, Expand and possibly exterminate, conquer and enslave, or be diplomatic with your alien contacts.

												This game is absolutely excellent. It successfully combines elements from dozens of other RTS, turn based, strategy and simulation games into an incredible package. The game is realtime, but resources are collected on a monthly basis, giving it a turn based feeling that feel remarkably appropriate. The ship customization system is also appropriately complex without being overwhelming. The nations and empires are incredibly customizable. Political, social and policies can change throughout the game. Potential Cons:Long. This game takes a long time to play. I have several saves with 10+ hours in them and I don't seem to be anywhere near end game. No micromanagement of fleets in battle. This doesn't bother me all that much, but for other RTS gamers they may find the inability to direct ship in battle maddening as particular ships take actions that may not make sense.			"

Do I use all of my vacation time in May? Sick days too? Do you guys expect me to just abandon my friends and family? Will my pets be neglected? You can't keep releasing games like this. It's insane. Too much quality, too much replayability, too much fun. This is why cocaine is illegal. Paradox needs to rethink their mission, because this approach to game development is ruining lives.			"

												Probably the most welcoming Paradox grand strategy game for new players. If you've never played a grand strategy before, this one should probably be your first one. The learning curve is much gentler than other Paradox games. The early game expansion is satisfying, the mid game challenge is varied: From PvE style pirates, space monsters to diplomacy and conquest. You spend the midgame building up, expanding and preparing for the late-game galaxy-shaking cataclysm. The starting conditions are varied and your species and empire is very customizable, leading to many varied play-styles from benevolent to absolutely monsterous, meaning you can play numerous campaigns, which will feel very different from each-other. This is also likely the most multiplayer-friendly game from Paradox's grand strategies. Netcode is rock-solid and the gameplay is very friendly to multiplayer. It is extremely rare for a player to get overwhelmed and need to pause the game.  It also runs much smoother than other grand strategy games, so if you're running it on a potato, it will run smoother than other Paradox games. This game has my full recommendation.			"

												I can make this review really short because most of the people who are even looking at this game are already long-time 4x strategy game fans. So Stellaris has all the depth of a 4x space strategy game except... it's not turn based, it's real time and can be paused whenever the need arises. So you've got all your government policies (including the ability to designate entire species as undesirable and genocide them, which is evil but being evil is fun in games), you've got your colonization, diplomacy with other powers, individual planet management, fleet management, build your own fleets, customize each ship, upgrade your ships when you research new technologies and so forth. It's great. And the big space battles are great to watch.It's like a more complicated Sins of a Solar Empire. Best space strategy game I've ever played I think.			"

												Honestly, not a day goes by where I get bored of this. Every game/campaign is unique with the randomisation of empires, species, and rather well-made AI. It's even more fun when you create your own race and empire from scratch, as well as having the option to actually play with/against empires you've previously created, and see how the AI would fare with them.I have yet to actually try the multiplayer feature, as Singleplayer is just so much fun already. However, I am sure Multiplayer is even more interesting, since the other empires aren't as predictable or easily persuaded. I will update this part of the review after playing on Multiplayer for some time.Overall, I give this a strong 9.8/10. My only gripes are the somewhat limited options in empire creation, being colour schemes for ships and certain species, as well as the somewhat static skyboxes of the galaxy and star systems (although rotating the camera pleasantly shows that each skybox is very gorgeous and virtually seamless). However, that's some real nitpicking there, considering I just love this game so much, and truly recommend it for any Space RTS fans (or even general RTS fans) out there.""Space exploration is a force of nature unto itself that no other force in society can rival.""~Neil deGrasse Tyson			"

												Patch 1.3 resolved one of the main frustrations, which improved the vanilla game immensely.Selecting some decent mods for the game makes it a cut above the genre...my guess is that certain mods will become unnecessary later on if the game is updated and patched up (fleet behaviour, ship balance, economic balance, sector management).The game does have some novel aspects (such as genetically altering your population species), and I would hope that either the devs or modders take these further (e.g. Don't like your troublesome neighbours?  Unleash a disease on them to genetically alter them to be fugly).V1.03 and modded up, gets HG's fast food voucher of the week and a big thumbs up.I might mention, in my current campaign I'm fighting a series of wars against the evil forces of giant floating blobber monsters, and the flying monkey dudes from the Wizard of Oz...that alone was value for money.

												After clocking in almost 43 hours, I can say this. If you rush in without knowing what you are doing, You will get killed faster than the MI during the Klendathu drop. It would be best to play a race with the full tutorial to learn, then once you got most of it down you should start a new race that you can breeze through the early game with. The most fun I have ever had in a Space 4X game. I give Stellaris a 9.5/10.                                                                      WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?			"

												Edited on 18th MayI finally crushed the Fallen Empire with barely any lose due to their reverse-engineered Tychon Lance and few other techs.The thing is you can't bombard them or any planet into oblivion...And the late game invading alien is not at all terrifying, I prepared all the fleet for them, only to face some ramnents of an invaders. Even then, their plenet is forever immortal that i neet to station some ships to keep bombing it.I wish to annihilate planets since I am running on massive deficit energy credit to fund my massive high- tech fleet. I had thought it'would take some significant lose against the renewed Fallen Fleet, but no, their number stayed as low as the last time i fought them while I boost new fleet within 40 years.This is stupid...PreviouslyWe were once small nations, restricted to a single planet. Discover of proper void craft technology and potential in the vastness of space enable us to move past petty conflicts. We form socio-economic and political union of Human Socialist Republic. The journey began with a small step limited to our sytem and nearby stars.Every exploration was full of danger and mystery; some were daunting, and some filled us with hope of greatness. Our first confirmed sentinent alien life form brought us fear, anxiety mixed with excitement. Yet it also expanded our horizon. We were lucky that our extended olive branches were responded in kind. Diplomatic relation were formed, exchanges were made with agreement favourable to both parties.But what truely changed us was not this wondrous relationship, neither were our growing Empire and brother species, rather the sound of War.Our growing might was first utilized in an opportuned strike against our failing rival; the Associate of Stars, their responds were crushed, and their planets conquered by another of their enemies. We grew confidence, and soon the mighty navy was once again utilized to pacify groups of small rivals.With numerous vallasages, we turned into an influential Empire of the known galaxy. Benevolence we were, our splendor knew no bound, so was techological knowledge and vast number of fleets. For a moment, we were the greatest empire.That is....untill we met them.The Fallen...As our border expanded, one of our expenitory ship journeyed into the forbidden part of the galaxy. Home to the species once conquered with galaxy before we ever gained sentinent. Their fleet while incomparable to eons past till outmatched and outnumbered us. Twice, we were declared war, and twice we lost. Our home world and numerous others were crushed in the first conflict. Humiliated beyond belief; our leaders rebuilt the fleet into an armada twice its former size. They were equipted with some of the most hi-tech available in the known space. Prepared for the next conflict they said. Surely enough, it came, but the result was not what we expected...Our fleet warped into one of their home systems the moment the mighty and arrogant Fallen Empire declared war on us; intending on annihilate any resistant. Supported by our allies, we carved out a large chunk of their forces and destroyed some of their space ports. But their resistant were fiercer than we anticipated. After months of space battle, our fleet were reduced to merely a sixth of its former size.In that instant, we once again have to bow to their unreasonable demands. Countless life were lost once again in forced abandoned colonies. We were shamed....Bur for how long?? We know defeat, but we know not to give upThe secrets of their special weapons are now ours. We are now even mightier than before, and soon the armada will be ready.			"

												Okay so I got this came about 2 weeks ago during the Steam Sale and I already have 76 hours in it which tells you how much I'm already obsessed  about it.  There's already tons of great reviews detailing all the aspects of the game so I'm going to talk about the stuff you don't hear about much.First there's three different types of faster-than-light travel. You can set the game where you can play with any of the three. Or lock it so that there is only one kind. Each form of travel requires different tactics. Second there's lots of little nuggets in this game from migrating giant trees. Anoying aliens that need your help and then start to need your help way too much. Precursor civilizations to discover. Pre sentience to uplift. Pre FTL races to conquer or to help. Third there's tons more to talk about but frankly I'd rather stop writing this review and go play Stellaris.......I have a feeling I'm going to be playing this game for a long time money well spent.At 150 hours of Play time I started a new game with a new race I created the Darzine Collective. An insectoid race Fanatical Collective and Militant. Think the Borg combined with the Bugs from Starship Troopers. They were Rapid Breeders (fast growth) and Very Adaptive. I ignored diplomacy, I ignored Tech building (researching or building them). I invaded Pre-warp races home worlds (1 machine age, 1 bronze age) Exterminating one and Enslaving another (within the first 50 turns of the game…). I was always technologically behind but always had bigger fleets that were very…. Replaceable. After battle I could scan the debris of battle to learn my enemies secretes.  Stellaris is flexible enough that I could do this and get away with it. Victory was Sweet.At 195 hours, I thought I was getting bored but then I discovered The Star Trek mod. The map is so huge… oh someone please help me………			"

												Stellaris plays like the endgame that SPORE should have gotten years ago.  You grow a society, it takes over a planet, you develop warp drive aaaannd.... now what?  Your ethics and universal disposition have led you here.  How will you make the galaxy yours?			"

												If you allow yourself to be sucked in and immersed into the beautiful game world that Stellaris provides, it will reward you with hours of engagement and fun enjoyment.+ Excellent race customization and new game setup options+ Exploration ""quests"" in the early game provide interesting and enjoyable diversions to keep you entertained while you wait for colonies to grow and things to be built.+ Incredible depth combined with a very decent user-friendly presentation.+ Presents a level of polish that exceeds humbled expectations.- Some gameplay concepts are not as easily presented as they could be. (e.g. It's not clear at first glance that placing a building on a tile on a planet surface will replace certain yields depending on the type of building until after you commit to clicking the ""Build"" button at which point the game tells you that building this building will replace the following yields). You're given the option to confirm, but a better means of communicating what the final yields would be for a tile given a certain building before clicking the Build button would be most welcome.- Cannot queue up ships or constructions to be built if you lack the resources to build them right now. This forces you to remember to build the thing you want to build later once the necessary resources are available. For instance, if you only have 50 minerals, you can't queue up a fleet of ships and have them be built as the resources come in; instead you must tend to the shipyard and build new ships as your resources come in manually.Verdict: Must BuyAny shortcomings or minor nuances that may bug you about this game will most likely be addressed in later patches given the developer's track record. In the game's current state you will still be rewarded with hours of enjoyment until then. And after the patches and DLCs come out, you'll get even more.If you like 4X games, this one is a no-brainer.			"

												Stellaris is an amazing title, and my favourite Paradox title of all time. I highly recommend you pick this game up when the new 1.5 patch rolls through, 'Banks'.Stellaris is a 4x grand strategy, with tonnes of roleplaying potential! Will you be a fanatic spiritualist? Purging all lifeforms who don't conform to your will? Will you be a fanatic materialist? Purging all lifeforms who are too primitive for your taste? Or, will you roleplay that Byzantium reformed into the Roman Empire, and be space romans? It's all up to you, will you be nice or will you be not so nice? It's all up to you.The level of customization is amazing. There are pre-made empires and an empire creator, where you create your species, homeworld, government and ship type. You start off picking your appearance, you're options are humanoid, mammalian, reptillian, avian, arthropoid, molluscoid, fungoid, and if you have the DLC pack 'Plantoids' you have plantoids. Each one of these categories have a number of different portraits to choose from.You then choose your species name and what their plural/adjective is; eg. Klaglyp / Klaglyps / Klaglypian. Next is the name lists, here you choose your name list, like humanoid 1, or plantoid 4, and so on, each name list contains a number of different and interesting names the game will pick from. Next are the traits, traits are your most defining feature of your species, traits are what you expect, fleeting, intelligent, communal, conformists, etc. There are more traits coming in Banks, but I will have the banks feature at the end of the review. Afterwards, you create your ruler, creating your ruler is pretty unnecesary unless you're playing at autocracy or a hivemind. (hiveminds not released yet, they will come in Banks).You can also create your homeworld, here you choose your homeworlds climate and name, you also choose your star's name and your cities appearance.Now you've got the government creator, here is where you choose your ethics and government type, in Banks, the governemnts are vastly more customizable (more on that later). Here is where you choose if you're a spiritualist collectivist or you're xenophilic pacifist or a multitude of other possible combinations. You also choose your empire name here and customize the flag.Next is ships, here you choose your starting weapons (kinetic, energy or missiles). You're preferred FTL method (wormholes, warp and hyperlane) and your ships appearance.I'm not going to go so in-depth now, because I don't want to spoil anymore, buy this game.As you explore the galaxy there are a lot of events that can happen, a lot of strong space beasties you will encounter, and a lot of potential threats you will meet, leaving the replayability endless.The tech tree is unique, there isn't a 'tree'♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but there is a card system, unless you have certain techs or government types, you have three cards to pick ,and each card is drawn at random, with weights on each card depending on ethics. After you've researched everything, you have mini-cards that will never end, allowing research to continue forever.Diplomacy is a little limited right now, but I'm positive it will improve with time (it is a Paradox Interractive game after all).'Banks', the soon to be released patch, is all about internal politics, I can't tell you all the features it adds, but here are some key ones: Hive minds, the name of your hive mind is the name of your empire too. Government, the new government adds civics and types, so now you can be a democracy while being a fanatic purifier, imagine the campaigns on that! ""I promise that I will pruge 20% more than Xzempus ka Hiel!"". Civics are modifiers for your empire, some are removable, like being a police state, while others are not. You can find civics like 'mechanist' where 4 of your pops start as robots, or 'Syncretic Evolution' where 4 of your pops start as another species! In what other sci-fi can you do this?!This game has a 10/10 potential, it's gone from decent to amazing within a year, and I cannot wait what the future holds!I give it an 8/10, with Banks, it will be a 9/10. With a more fleshed out middle game, federation politics and general polish, 10/10 easily.			"

Posted: February 26
												I got Stellaris last week and instantly became addicted, the depth and immersion sucking me in like a black hole. Much of the game was excellent, but I'm here to share my experiences with some problems, and offer suggestions for improvement.#1 ""Fallen"" EmpiresI started out with this setting turned on, assuming it meant I'd have (extinct) ancient civilizations to explore, for story and research opportunities. As my people reached for the stars, they discovered these ""Fallen"" Empires were actually galactic superpowers. Without warning, hostile fleets (50k-100K in power) invaded while my empire was in its infancy, eradicating every last trace of my race.#2 War Goals (and altering them)I like the war goal system as a concept, but in practice it has numerous problems. Some war goals I never considered because they were too costly, such as vassals--it's cheaper and simpler to take total control of their planets. I see no logic in that.Also, why are we unable to change war goals? In the flow of time and in the ever-changing state of the galaxy, certain events can radically change you perspective and goals. (Why can't we change our mind about liberation and force our enemies to cede instead?) If you're invasion is fairing better than anticipated, with every planet invaded or blockaded, I should be able to force my demands for their entire empire. With the system as it is now, taking an empire piece by piece over the span of decades (because of the forced truce system--a related issue) can be frustrating and, again, I see no logic in that. The system is too limiting--I don't want the game to tell me I'm asking for too much, that is something for ME to decide.#3 Space Warfare, Fleet Management, Idle Ships, and Disobeying Direct OrdersManaging a galactic empire isn't always about sunshine and lollipops and rainbows. Sometimes, you have to get your hands dirty. The war itself can be stressful, but not nearly as stressful as managing your fleets. In war, one small mistake can result catastrophic loss of life, or give way to defeat. There are so many problems with fleet management I'm not sure where to begin.We need more information on the map. Give us icons for space ports and armies (not just occupying armies) and the races in each system. I need to know which system is inhabited by which race, so when I'm trying to raise an army I don't have to click every planet in the entire galaxy to find which ones are inhabited by a certain race--a simple icon or just a word would alleviate this issue. I don't want to have to zoom in a search every time.Military stations also have too large of a dead-zone radius. I understand the ""balancing"" effect of this dead-zone, so that you can't stack too many fortresses together...but why? Isn't the balancing effect that they cost resources to maintain? It's space, by the way, (it isn't flat) with plenty of room to build whatever I want wherever I want. Nothing is stopping me from building 10 fortresses around a world except the game telling me to ""be fair.""Well I have news for you--life isn't fair. Wars are fought by seizing advantages and exploiting weaknesses, stacking the odds in your favor or crippling the enemy so they don't stand a chance. Instead, my admirals are more concerned with fairness. ""This world is too fortified, its defenses too tight. The enemy won't be able to break through easily, so we need to spread these stations out and give them a fighting chance."" What?#4 Armies, Attachments, (and varieties)I have another strategic issue. Armies have an ""attachment"" feature, but to apply an attachment you need to go through an externally tedious process. You need the build the army, select each army individually (while still planet-side) and then manually click to add an attachment. When you're raising multiple armies across and entire galaxy, this feature is far too tedious to bother with, so despite the advantages I simply ignored it--I'm not wasting my time clicking individual every army.The fix is simple. When building an army, just incorporate the attachment feature at the army creation stage, not after. Just click ""build with attachment"" or add another army type to the build option list. Give armies the option to upgrade too. I'd like to see more done with them, like selecting weapon/armor types, or other features that can be added. Army policies and tactics would also be a great feature (set armies to liberate slave populations or auto purge). I want my troops to feel more real than little green circles. There are not enough options for planetary surface defenses.Also, if the planet is full and still raising any army the ""excess"" troops automatically go into orbit.Planets have a maximum troop limit? I understand this from a balancing point of view, but really, what's stopping me from building or landing a massive force on a planet? Why can't the balance simply be resource consumption, like food! If I want to devote a planet for the sole purpose of troop training and residence, I should be able.#5 Rebel ScumRebel factions are impossible to eliminate. In 60 hours, I never quelled one rebellion despite my best efforts. I would adopt social welfare programs, information quarantine, propaganda broadcast, employ re-education campaigns, and even genetically modify species to become conformists, suppressed them and integrated them in the factions tab--I even had the strategic resource to pacify them--I did EVERYTHING I could.There was no peaceful solution.#6 Diplomacy (or not)I didn't deal much with diplomacy and trade not because I had no interest, but it was a rather barren feature. Sure, you could interact with species diplomatically, and there were some options, but I was shocked that forming an alliance or ""federation"" was a technology that had to be researched. Trade had so few options. I attempted a few resource and star chart exchanges, sometimes a research agreement (which I still don't understand how it works). There wasn't much there. Diplomacy needs many more options, especially since its a defining feature of the game.We should be able to exchange researched technology through diplomacy. Again, it happens all the time in reality. This way, we have other options rather than watching the clock as the paint dries. This would encourage diplomacy and making friends. Instead of only political options like war and peace, and very limited trade, a whole new aspect of the game would open up. I would actually have incentive to stay on an empire's good side if they have tech I want and we could become better economic partners. Trading resources is bland. You could also trade slaves.In the diplomacy window, it would be nice to make demands without going to war. Why not encourage a peaceful alternative? Instead of ""war goals"" why not ""peace goals"" as well? With systems recently acquired or conquered, instead of purging or integrating the population, I wish there was an option to deport them to the empire they belong to. The more options, the better.#7 Parting ShotsAdding (or removing) systems to a sector can be buggy. Sometimes I accidentally click the wrong system and take it out of the sector, costing influence. This mistake happened to me far too many times and I hate losing resource over a system being buggy (sometimes I had to click a few times.) If you click on a system, and it would be removed from a system, give us a warning first that says ""are you sure you?""Another issue was that automatically surveying systems was a technology, not a default order. Why? Auto ""assist research"" should be an option too. Adding the same feature of auto-building to construction ships would eliminate some frustration. Planets need an auto-upgrade structure option--I hate forgetting about surface tiles and having to check for upgrades years after the upgrade was researched.Some things in Stellaris made me rethink the phase ""slow as molasses"" (I have newfound respect for how fast molasses moves.)

												Stellaris is an interesting entry in the turn based space exploration genera of games.  The mechanics are well thought out and while not as tuned as I would like, provides an open framework for exploring the universe in different ways with different ethos. User interface design, with steep learning curve is the primary detractor. So much so that you need to commit to playing the game for at least 20 hours before you will understand 50% of the options you have.  Story telling is also very weak.  I have seen good improvements over the last two releases. I recommend this game if like 4x games and are willing to invest in a game. If you are unsure you can try Free Orion which is shareware and functions like races that use hyperlanes in Stellaris.			"

												I'll be brief in my summary.Paradox makes good games. This is another in a long list produced by them such as Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings and Hearts of Iron. While this game, even on its fastest setting plays a bit slower than Europa Universalis, it can be just as fun. Empire building in space. What more can you ask for?The customization of your empire is pretty flexible. You can pick your species, traits for said species, starting weaponry, type of government, type of interstellar travel etc and all of these will impact your gameplay. There is a built in ship designer for your every need and wants. The steam workshop takes this even further.Explore, Expand and possibly exterminate, conquer and enslave, or be diplomatic with your alien contacts. The choice is yours.All in all its a great game that offers alot of replay so you definitely get the bang for your buck. I have enjoyed my time playing it and look forward to furture updates.			"

												Fantastic game. Never played many Paradox games in the past, but I'm definitely a fan now. Already put in a fair amount of hours, and feel like I've barely scratched the surface.If you are looking for a more in-depth Civ, this is your game. Fantastic atmosphere. Great in-depth gameplay.

												As someone who isn't a big RTS/4K fan, this is actually a fairly fun time waster.  The mid-game portion can get rather slow and tedius, but overall it's pretty good. A big plus is the devs are always updating stuff, they didn't just cut and run at release like other studios have done.			"

												This game is absolutely excellent. It successfully combines elements from dozens of other RTS, turn based, strategy and simulation games into an incredible package. The game is realtime, but resources are collected on a monthly basis, giving it a turn based feeling that feel remarkably appropriate. The ship customization system is also appropriately complex without being overwhelming. The nations and empires are incredibly customizable. Political, social and policies can change throughout the game. Potential Cons:Long. This game takes a long time to play. I have several saves with 10+ hours in them and I don't seem to be anywhere near end game. No micromanagement of fleets in battle. This doesn't bother me all that much, but for other RTS gamers they may find the inability to direct ship in battle maddening as particular ships take actions that may not make sense.			"

												A great 4k strategy game that offers a unique experience every time you play with a galaxy full of random events and randomally generated species. The game lets you live your dream of creating a species from scratch and making it a galactic empire. Concept wise the game stands apart from others in the genre and is addicting to play always drawing you in to complete one more task.  However, there are some issues currently the sector and planet limit is in my opinion to small making it a pain to expand your empire after creating a few sectors. The games diplomacy is weak and lacks options especially considering Paradox's other titles (ex. Crusader Kings). Planetary administration is a bit boring and repeative do to limited buildings and slow population growth the game is clearly centered around space with planetary actions being a secondary thought. Planetary invasions and ground combat is unexciting you never see the fighting instead you see blue icons representing the ground forces slowly get chipped away from the opposing force. However, despite all of these cons the game accomplishes its goal at being a sci-fi 4k strategy game and where the game lacks in planetary actions it easy makes up for with space actions and space combat which plays out in real time. On a side note the game has a strong modding community and most of the cons previously mentioned are easily fixed with mods. So if your looking for a good 4k game that is sci-fi orinted then this in my opinion is your best option.			"

Stellaris is exemplary in the aspect that you can create any kind of species or empire with the amazing  ethics and government types which add a great variety to the game. Stellaris also excels with is amazing art design, graphics and species' potraits. The diplomacy between empires is interesting and wars constantly change the polictical balance of the universe. Stellaris is clearly a stellar game.			"

												Probably the best Space 4x I have ever played.  Are their gaps and minor weaknesses in details such as trade and civilian economy?  Certainly; however, the graphics, ease of use, tutorial system, and story which is buiulds is second to none.  Think Distant Worlds when it first came out, with more refinement, easier to use, and much better graphics, and their patches (which they call DLC even though they are free) make it better and better.  Upcoming next month with Heinlin is a complete rebalance of ships, the implementation of actual ship roles, the additiona of independent stations to provide services, and more refinement on AI pirates/creatures.  While the paid for part of it (if you choose to get it) means the addition of Guardians and further storyline expansion.Add in the workshop content and this game has it all.  Want to play in the universe of Honor Harrington?  Someone has made a good facsimilie of that already, want more events and story, again someone has made that as well.  The support of the developers, their level of communication, and the overall polish on this game is second to none.  Well worth the investment.			"

												The story of the Blessed Cevelli Republic,The Cevelli people began on the world known as Oros, a dry arid world in which they would build their Republic, and eventually, their powerful federation of numerous different species. The Celvelli were physically strong and also quite intelligent, they were a very spirtualistic people as well. When they ventured into the unknown, they soon found other species. They expanded their borders through being technologically superior to their neighbors, and through conquest and ethnic liberation. There were many non-Cevelli rulers of the blessed republic, and for a time they were quite prosperous, and on the slight, rather warlike, yet they only attempted to eliminate threats to their federation....The final threat was a stagnant empire, awoken, that would challenge the federations power in their region of the Galaxy. As the first attack on the Republic commenced... Worlds fell... Armies overwhelmed... But, the federation was taken by surprise. They organized their fleets into one attack to destroy the grand enemy fleet that was so technologically superior. In the months prior to the assembly of the Grand Offensive, intergalactic subspace echoes were intercepted nearing the galaxy... Something was out there, but we didn't know what... The end days of the Republic and their federation were approaching.After the grand attack commenced, thousands of lives were lost, the federation outnumbered the fallen empire 3-1, yet the entire fleet (205k vs 170k) was destroyed in a brave attempt te beat back the attackers. Worlds continued to fall, and then they showed up... The Prethoryn... Soon after, the federation was engulfed, and no more, the many species enslaved or purged. 10/10, Would get my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me by intergalactic aliens and a fallen empire.			"

Our seeking tentacles reach out to the vastness of race, and find many signs of the old ones.  First, we find a zealotous reptiles, obviously the servents of the Dagon and his Deep Ones.   We rival and declare war on the believers of this inferior god, and our tentacly ships invade and purge the inferiors.  This game is a great platform.  I am eager to see what sort of content they release to support it.  The events are interesting and impactful.  Many features are things i've been dreaming of in space 4x for years.  It definately itches that scratch.  Worth the asking price in a generation of 69.99$+DLC season patch AAA titles that fall into shallow buggy crap.			"

												Started Game at 5pm with intent to only make new race. Figure, might as well get Empire up and running, then go do Real World responsibilities. Mushrooms begin rivalry after 3 years. Aboebas slaughter one of my systems after 12 years. Need to upgrade to cruisers after 50 years. Look over at clock, its 2 am. War is about to be waged on Avian cowards.10/10 would experience dehydration again to slaughter Turtle Rebellion.			"

												Hide your wife, hide your kids, close your windows and doors, because this game is on fire! Combining the fluent grand strategy gameplay of most of the other Paradox Entertainment games with an amazing broad sci-fi setting. Making your own species and cultivating relations with others. I simply love this game, even though the mid-game ramp up is a bit of a drag sometimes, the early game and end-game vibe is amazing. I'm sure Paradox will nurture this game into a true gem of Galactic proportions. Buy it and tell your friends, family and foes, it's that good!			"

												I've got quite a few games in my collection, and I'm glad to have made the purchase of this particular gem. The soundtrack is moving and the gameplay is addictive. There is a bit of a learning curve, and I have yet to reach the end game goals, but not through lack of trying. Transverse the star and attempt to colonize new worlds, discover new life and attempt to befriend it....or declare war and acquire their worlds/resources. Research new technologies, mine for minerals, build starports and fleets.More information/details to follow.			"

												I'm absolutely loving the game. Paradox hit another homer for the grand strategy genre. I have over 1000 hours on ck2 and i never even made it to the very end. Sounds bad but i love changing the scenario of my playthrough. Its the same for stellaris.The one thing i dont understand is the lack of content. Ck2 thrived off mods but i could also play the vanilla. Stellaris on the otherhand it feels like mods are neccessary. The vanilla seems pretty bland. I'm just shocked that some mods i have including things like mining stations, sensor stations, bigger & better ship designs(i.e. flagships), more in-depth tech wasn't part of the vanilla. They really feel like no brainers for a 4X space game IMO. Don't get me wrong this is just constructive criticism for paradox, i can't comprehend none of the devs had these ideas or that they rushed the release and cut it all out, so we ended up with just 4 basic warship designs( for example). Also, idk if asimov fixed it yet since i just use mods to avoid sectors, but fix the sector AI. Totally destroying my planets with basic research labs wtf. "

												Original Review: This really scratched that 4x space game I have been having.  After SOTS 2 I was warry about anything from Paradox but  this game made up for that for sure.  Good job guysEDIT After playing 500+ hours:Pros:- Well balanced- The devs keep adding more and more and are responding well to the community- Few bugs- Active modding community- Challenging Achivements- Easy to learn but hard to master- Does not require massive micromanagementCons:- The sector Build AI could use a litte work, but overall it works well enough.- Late game gets a little monotonous once you are able to crush anything.- I have lost too much sleep from ""Just one more turn!""Currently it is 3 weeks from the release of the Utopia DLC and I have been watching streams from the devs playing development builds.  I am really happy to say that the direction they are taking the game is awesome.  In this DLC/Patch they are also putting in fixes and some features for even those that dont get the DLC so ya... these guys are top notch and if you like Masters of Orion II, SOTSs, or any kind of space x4 you NEED to get this.  Just do it, you will not regret it.			"

A little barebones at times(though I hear they are going to at features with updates and then latter DLC), but something speacial none the less.			"

												Rather mediocre and lackluster in mid game as many of the reviews have already stated but the potential for improvement is enormous given that the base game has plenty of tasks for the player and the gameplay functions well enough. Paradox needs to simply add more content and depth for gameplay. Knowing Paradox, they will likely go through with the improvements. However, I'm not looking forward to paying the all the DLCs that's to come for all the fixes and content. I'll give this one a thumbs up for optimism in hopes that they'll release some good additions for free in their patches.			"

												This game is absolutely excellent. It successfully combines elements from dozens of other RTS, turn based, strategy and simulation games into an incredible package. The game is realtime, but resources are collected on a monthly basis, giving it a turn based feeling that feel remarkably appropriate. The ship customization system is also appropriately complex without being overwhelming. The nations and empires are incredibly customizable. Political, social and policies can change throughout the game. Potential Cons:Long. This game takes a long time to play. I have several saves with 10+ hours in them and I don't seem to be anywhere near end game. No micromanagement of fleets in battle. This doesn't bother me all that much, but for other RTS gamers they may find the inability to direct ship in battle maddening as particular ships take actions that may not make sense.			"

												If I had to describe this game, ""Spores + EU4"" would essentially be my description of it. It lives up to the standard of Paradox grand strategy games, and is one of the few that I would not mind paying for DLC. My only real gripes are that diplomacy seems fairly mechanistic and impersonal. I was really excited when my militant theocratic fox empire came into contact with a materialist plutocratic oligarchy, but nothing really came out of dialogue options. There's also not really that much variability, they could have done more with the species, and it's rather annoying having to mod name lists in when it would have been easy to just let you create a custom list. More CK-ish features such as dynamic portraits would have been awesome rather than just making all characters look the same besides minor differences. Like I said, it's one of the few games that I hope there will be DLC for, especially because of that reason.			"

Playing 2 player co-op? You can spawn right next door to your friend. BrilliantOverall: 9.5/10 - An excellent game right now, that will only get better because of the Dev's approach to game support, improvement, free feature updates and cosmetic DLCs.

Posted: May 11, 2016
												I don't do reviews often, but having played the game for a length of time, I can safely say that I have a relatively fair opinion on the game so far. For context, I've played a number of 4x games and grand strategies. I'm generally a fan of what Paradox Interactive tends to produce, but I will try to maintain an objective opinion at all times during the review.Firstly, Stellaris is an combination of a 4x (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) and grand strategy game. You'll see and feel the 4x influence during the initial course of the game. I feel like it is this early phase that Stellaris has captured well and does incredibly well. You'll create your own race (or choose from the pre-mades) with their own government type, ethos as a government, native world type, what sort of FTL you use, and more. These decisions can and generally will set the pace for the rest of the game. Once you've picked your race, you're plopped into your homeworld's system and soon you're sending science ships off to explore the neighboring systems of the galaxy and expand your people. Eventually, you'll encounter sentient forms of life like yourself and they'll have their own set of ethos. One thing that I think Stellaris does well is that every race you meet will have a unique name, ethos, government, etc. every time you play. The only thing that generally remains consistent is the pool of portraits that both you and the AI have to choose from. There is quite a bit of variety, but you can sometimes end up with pictures repeating. Even so, I feel like a sandbox where anything is possible adds to the replayability. I'm not always going to encounter mammalians with the same portrait, strengths, weaknesses, etc. each time I play the game. Therefore, my strategy needs to adapt based on who and what I encounter.As previously mentioned, Stellaris handles the early game very well. It's a constant state of exploring, your science ships uncovering new quests and anomolies in the galaxy, and expansion once you start building your colony ships. Another good thing about Stellaris, though some may disagree, is that research is handled on a card based system. There are three types of research (physics, society, and engineering) and initially most empires will start with three possible choices in each category. Pick wisely, as you may not see certain techs again or not for awhile. This adds another depth of decision making and changes the game up so you're not constantly delving into the same strategy each game. Additionally, it sets the empires apart a bit. Research possibilities can be locked or unlocked based on your ethos as an empire and the same holds true for the AI. Some techs are even marked purple as rare techs and some are marked red as dangerous. They're dangerous techs as the outcome of utilizing said dangerous tech can lead to a crisis happening in the late game. More on that in a bit.Now to the part where Stellaris lacks. The mid game. Once everyone has settled, planets have been established, and borders are fairly clear, Stellaris can start to grow dull. This is a part of the game where you often have to make your own objectives because there isn't a lot of content in this part of the game. You'll either war, uplift pre-FTL primitive species, invade said species (if your ethos allows it), deal with the rare internal strife issue, or continue exploring as best you can. I feel like there's a lot of potential in some of the gameplay systems so far, but they definitely need more fleshing out. As many who play Paradox games know, this will generally mean that Stellaris is going to receive a ton of DLC in the near future. This can and will probably turn some of you off from the game. However, I can safely say that Stellaris is a complete game as of release and has enough that will keep people interested, especially as you transition to the late game.At the late game, those dangerous techs I mentioned could've been researched by other empires OR you may have a situation where extra-galactic invaders have come to infest everyone. These are generally galaxy-wide crises that can snowball out of control if left unchecked. One criticism I have about these crises is that the AI doesn't take them seriously and this behavior can allow the endgame crises to snowball quickly, especially if you're on the other side of the galaxy from them and can't do anything about it. However, these end game crises shake up a common issue found in 4x. You'll find yourself possibly in a situation where you're not the top dog (if you managed to become that during play) and this opens up the potential for a situation where ""losing is !FUN!"" or you might solidify your strength in the galaxy by overcoming this obstacle. I feel like this is an area where Paradox can definitely add more to the future, as I'd like to see greater variety in the endgame crises. Most things in the game end up being original or different every time you play and I'd hate to see it where a similar strategy becomes common against the endgame threats every time. In any event, Stellaris is very much solid as a base game and definitely adds a new take on the 4x genre by adding some GSG elements to it. However, the GSG elements are dominately on display during the mid game and sorely need some additional fleshing out and substance to make the mid game less of a drag. The early game exploration and late game galactic threats, however, make the game a recommended buy from me. HOWEVER, if you are not the sort of person that doesn't like DLC or want to wait for Stellaris to be more fleshed out and detailed like EU4, CK2, and other Paradox titles have become, I would not suggest Stellaris for the people in the anti-DLC group and recommend those wanting a more definitive experience until Stellaris has been built upon with additional content for the latter group. Rest assured, with how well Stellaris has done so far, it should be clear that Paradox intends to support Stellaris for a long time. Given the resources that Paradox has at its disposal by comparison to other strategy/4x developers, I look forward to seeing what they do with the game in the future. If you enjoy the 4x/GSG genre, I still recommend the game despite its few faults. Have fun storming the galaxy!			"

												18h isn't much for a Paradox game. And that says everything... I'm not very willing to start a new game. Why?I wouldn't recommend it for the moment, nor say people ""don't buy it"".I personally find it much better than other Galactic 4x (endless space and Galactic Civilizations), so it deserves a thumb up, however it is far below other Paradox games, so it would deserve a thumb down.As tons of people say the early game is awesome. The mid game is boring, if you get lucky enough to reach it. On my last playthrough, in Hard difficulty, everything was going fine. I was on track with other empires. Had some grand strategic movements in mind. A good army on par with others, with about 10 platform defense on the most important points of my Empire.Good! Good!!And then... A Fallen Empire declares war. That is something really bad for game balancing as they are completely overpowered compared to other Empires. The guy declares war for forcing me to abandon half of my Empire and sends me a 80K army in my face. I have 5K... And you can't expect to have much much more after 4 hours gameplay.Game ruined... Have to start another game... Com'on... I play in Very hard since the first Hearts of Iron. I'm playing Ironman in Crusader Kings 2 where I'm twice Emperor and I can't even count how many Realms I have. I'm far from being a newbie in Paradox Games.Such punitive events cannot happen in a Paradox Game. It would by like if in Hears of Iron you're playing Germany and you have a chance out of x that in 1938 just after the Anschluss EVERYONE declares a war on you (Russia, USA, Japan, France, UK, Poland, Tchekoslovakia, Italy, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Holland...). You can be as strong as you want, you just can't stand such things...Apart from this kind of stuff the game is well done. Ultra stable. No bugs (for me at least). Very well polished. UI is great. But it feels so empty compared to others Paradox Game.Don't get me wrong, it's much better than all others 4X / Grand strategy games, but Paradox kind of used me (us) to much better...Superficial diplomacy. Non existent politics (Ministers? Parties? Government policies like drafting, economy scale, education etc in HOI?). Non existent economy / war economy (convoys? supply to troops (something like that...)). Personalities traits? I don't expect something as deep as Crusader Kings, but com'on... Each Character has 1 trait... No relation effect..I mean... Paradox seems to me very lazy on this game.I'm sure they will turn out to be a HUGE game within some years, but at this point... It is sooooooooo below other Paradox games. It's way below day 1 Crusader Kings. I'm a bit disappointed. But yet, it's a good compared to competition			"

												Stellaris has the makings of greatness in its DNA. It's obvious after 10 hours of play there is a lot to love here, but also a lot to be desired. While I can see myself getting many hours of enjoyment out of the game I do hope they add some breadth and depth to the mid-end game. Overall I think they've done a great job of advancing the sub-systems and general flow / pace of play compared to previous titles (EU4 and CKII for example) and it's apparent to me they understand that helping users overcoming the barriers to entry is a fight worth having. I highly recommend Stellaris is you're looking for a tight 4X game and have been dissapointed by the recent additions to the genre. This is a great game, and if history is to repeat itself Paradox will be tweaking and building on the core game for years to come.			"

												Stellaris is a nice, current, addition to the 4x sci-fi family of games. Stellaris is NOT Master of Orion (in any iteration) and I find significant differences in the degree of necessary micromanagement and diplomacy. The tech system is simple and clean, though, without an in game ""visible"" tree, what you research and when is left open to ""chance/insipriation"" rather than by focus. The odds of going down a given tech chain do increase with more techs in said chain, but, when new, knowing what chains are actually there is very much a ""black box"" (without looking at game files).Diplomacy, thus far, is superior to many sandbox/4x games I have played todate. The AI, when operating on it's own, remains above average, both in their interactions with the player and between AI to AI. AI operations become more ""questionable"" in either an alliance or a federation--where their ability for independent action seems to have been labotimised.Stellaris is highly modable and has scores of options for alteration. This allows for a nearly infinite replayability.My greatest complaint with Stellaris is the fragile quest chains currently present. Though the quests/missions are well written, several of the longer chains can be very readily broken, and thus the quest being incompletable. This, I hope, will be addressed in future patches.I have found multiplayer to be enjoyable, however, the speed of the game and the time required to complete a full game, currently makes pick-up games of Stellaris impossible. That is to say, unless you have a regular group for regular gaming sessions, you will NEVER finish a multi-player game of Stellaris. This, I find, is unfortunate. The scale of Stellaris is one of it's major selling points, but that same scale makes pick-up multiplayer matches untenable.Thus far I highly recommend this title. We shall see what future patches and DLC afford.			"

												I am actually loving this game. Was watching it since a few weeks before release. Bought it the day after release and am very happy with the end product. Stellaris is -- obviously a space 4x strategy game, something not unheard of but I feel as if this game does the genre a real duty. Another of Paradox Interactives absolute beauties of a game.What's good bro?-STELLAR graphics  (see what I did there :P)-Intricate tech system-Fun yet game changing end-game events (wont spoil ;D)-A more complex sort of rock, paper, scissors fleet combat system-Interesting resource management along with the addition of strategic resources-A beautiful galactic map-Interesting anomaly system - linked with questsWhat's not?-Resource system is somewhat simple and could use a revamp - though it does work-Planetary Invasion could use a touch up-War goals could be diversified - at the moment there's not alot of options-Espionage would be a very interesting addition - with the possibility to incite a revolution-More techs? Plez? - there is alot, although I think there could be more >:D-Improvement of the 'quest' system as it can be blocked by trading survey data with other empires as it is mostly reliant on anomalies.(Looks like alot in cons section but really these aren't bad things about the game -- just I feel as if they could be better)Overall - Throw your money at this game, for £35 it is a steal for the joy this will bring to you -- atleast being a fan of strategic 4x games myself. 9/10 atleast.P.S. You will not have a life once this game enters your library D:			"

												Stellaris is a grand strategy game mixed with 4x elements. Like Paradox' other titles, this game is made with a lot of love and attention to detail, while still providing a fun gameplay experience with almost infinite replayablity. The personal empire creation and expansion gives the player the perfect pioneer feeling, while the mid-game politics aspects turn the game into a whole new experience. Mentionable features are the alien race creation with its ethics and the indept ship customization. Yet, there are stilll some flaws with it. while other paradox titles give you great and well positioned information, once the player got to know the interface, stellaris lacks this comfort. Here you have to do perform 2-5 clicks more to find the info you need. in the mid to late game, the game tends to lag in big universes, even with a decent pc (gtx 980, i5 4690k, 16GB RAM), which makes it less enjoyable.All in all, this game is totally worth your money, if you like strategy games. it is, in contrast to other paradox titles, very easy to get into, yet lets you improve your skills each time you try a new start. If you are looking for a space exploration and politics game, there are no better alternatives than this!			"

												I will add more information later, but I love the game, its very intense covering all major points of 4X.the only problem I have, which maybe removed by user made content, is the battles are stupid after a few minutes into it. The ships all decide to make a huge ball of lights, sounds, and ships. They climp up like a ball of yarn and you can't see anything until its over. Also you can't tell them (that I am aware of) to target anything such as weak ships first or strong ones which the commander in me goes nuts over.All in all I hope every 4X games gets a lot of idea's from this game and I hope that Stellaris pays tribute to star drive from which most of the races look akin to. (not the ships they did a good job at making those unique)			"

												While I would still recommend this game, it does feel like it needs a lot of work in fleshing out the game more. The AI empires still feel like they are just there and communicate with you very little. The start is exciting, exploring the unknown, but the sense of exploration gets lost once you have several AI empires discovered near you and space starts to get a little boring. It also seems the AI still needs plenty of work with wars and sectors.On the plus side, this game has plenty of modding potential and the music is great. There is no research tree, instead there is a more interesting and rewarding feel of gaining technology.			"

												Everything you've heard is true. This game is absolutely amazing, full of potential and depth and yet as many have said and still are saying, the game falls flat mid/late game. It doesnt help that achievments are bugged, along with other things. At times the AI players can be very stale and scripted events become wildly underwhelming. Despite all of this, I still had an amazing 18hrs with this game. I spent an hour just creating my government and my species traits. I went on a war path to bring all other species into my fold. I researched, my scientist proclaimed himself a God on an unenlightened planet and I saved the same planet from a mass extinction event. I won't go into big detail repeating what everyone else has said. What I will say though is, kudos for the devs promising to patch in missing content and fix this. I am happy to hear this, but knowing what I know I'd say wait to buy this until they do. If you buy it now you won't have a bad time, but you'll feel what's missing and that may put you off of it entirely. I my self have decided to hang Stellaris up for awhile until all of this gets sorted out.			"

Another feature I like is that there is diversity in how every specy is developed: some are in early stone age, some are just below you, some just above you, some are old fallen empires and some extinct long ago.

I dont think it does affect the gameplay.Although the game still need more polishing ( more DLC maybe? ) As of 1.1 , i think they do auto build spaceports on sectors.Currently i'm replaying the game ver 1.1 on vanilla iron-man mode to try and get all achievements.Having a bug where i invade plan and enemy surrender to me , my solders get stucked on their planet (i have read forum and im not the only one having this problem , they will get it fixed soon)			"

												I definitely recommend Stellaris. The setting is fantastic and it is hugely enjoyable, it offers enough depth and customisation to get you truly hooked.There are some things you need to know though:-If you're playing a large game, there's a significant amount of lag end game making it near unplayable. I believe they are working on a fix for this.-Mid game is sorely lacking.-You can cheese the game currently with vassals.-Diplomacy is lacking.-There are only 2 victory conditions: Conquest - Conquer or vassalise all factions, Domination - hold 40% of habitable planets.-Research is RNG, this is good and bad.-You can't realistically play a small empire and be able to comete with bigger ones. You have a higher chance of forming alliances but the beneifits of expanding are much greater.-Fallen empires can massively disrupt your progression.Sure the list is fairly large but the nice things Stellaris does outweigh them and Paradox will definitely work on some of them and improving the game overall. This ranks as one of the best space strategy games of all time for me.			"

												If you liked Imperium Galactica 2 back then, chances are very high that you will love Stellaris.This game has everything I've ever wanted from a space empire game and more.The war system is a bit unintuitive but it prevents empires steamrolling the galaxy. Very interesting events happen and your science ship will encounter strange anomalies, life forms, ruins of long forgotten empires and terrifying enemies.Lot of micromanagment but nothing you cant handle as there is a time manipulation/pause function, so you can play at your preferred pace.Later on you can divide your empire into sectors and give directives on how these should develop so you can concentrate on the big picture.There are no event video clips (like in Total War games for example), but I actually like this as I tend to skip those anyway after having watched them once, meaning dev time and money went into gameplay and not so much eye candy.Pricing is a bit off, especially DLCs, but luckily we have steam sale events!

												I don't do reviews often, but having played the game for a length of time, I can safely say that I have a relatively fair opinion on the game so far. For context, I've played a number of 4x games and grand strategies. I'm generally a fan of what Paradox Interactive tends to produce, but I will try to maintain an objective opinion at all times during the review.Firstly, Stellaris is an combination of a 4x (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) and grand strategy game. You'll see and feel the 4x influence during the initial course of the game. I feel like it is this early phase that Stellaris has captured well and does incredibly well. You'll create your own race (or choose from the pre-mades) with their own government type, ethos as a government, native world type, what sort of FTL you use, and more. These decisions can and generally will set the pace for the rest of the game. Once you've picked your race, you're plopped into your homeworld's system and soon you're sending science ships off to explore the neighboring systems of the galaxy and expand your people. Eventually, you'll encounter sentient forms of life like yourself and they'll have their own set of ethos. One thing that I think Stellaris does well is that every race you meet will have a unique name, ethos, government, etc. every time you play. The only thing that generally remains consistent is the pool of portraits that both you and the AI have to choose from. There is quite a bit of variety, but you can sometimes end up with pictures repeating. Even so, I feel like a sandbox where anything is possible adds to the replayability. I'm not always going to encounter mammalians with the same portrait, strengths, weaknesses, etc. each time I play the game. Therefore, my strategy needs to adapt based on who and what I encounter.As previously mentioned, Stellaris handles the early game very well. It's a constant state of exploring, your science ships uncovering new quests and anomolies in the galaxy, and expansion once you start building your colony ships. Another good thing about Stellaris, though some may disagree, is that research is handled on a card based system. There are three types of research (physics, society, and engineering) and initially most empires will start with three possible choices in each category. Pick wisely, as you may not see certain techs again or not for awhile. This adds another depth of decision making and changes the game up so you're not constantly delving into the same strategy each game. Additionally, it sets the empires apart a bit. Research possibilities can be locked or unlocked based on your ethos as an empire and the same holds true for the AI. Some techs are even marked purple as rare techs and some are marked red as dangerous. They're dangerous techs as the outcome of utilizing said dangerous tech can lead to a crisis happening in the late game. More on that in a bit.Now to the part where Stellaris lacks. The mid game. Once everyone has settled, planets have been established, and borders are fairly clear, Stellaris can start to grow dull. This is a part of the game where you often have to make your own objectives because there isn't a lot of content in this part of the game. You'll either war, uplift pre-FTL primitive species, invade said species (if your ethos allows it), deal with the rare internal strife issue, or continue exploring as best you can. I feel like there's a lot of potential in some of the gameplay systems so far, but they definitely need more fleshing out. As many who play Paradox games know, this will generally mean that Stellaris is going to receive a ton of DLC in the near future. This can and will probably turn some of you off from the game. However, I can safely say that Stellaris is a complete game as of release and has enough that will keep people interested, especially as you transition to the late game.At the late game, those dangerous techs I mentioned could've been researched by other empires OR you may have a situation where extra-galactic invaders have come to infest everyone. These are generally galaxy-wide crises that can snowball out of control if left unchecked. One criticism I have about these crises is that the AI doesn't take them seriously and this behavior can allow the endgame crises to snowball quickly, especially if you're on the other side of the galaxy from them and can't do anything about it. However, these end game crises shake up a common issue found in 4x. You'll find yourself possibly in a situation where you're not the top dog (if you managed to become that during play) and this opens up the potential for a situation where ""losing is !FUN!"" or you might solidify your strength in the galaxy by overcoming this obstacle. I feel like this is an area where Paradox can definitely add more to the future, as I'd like to see greater variety in the endgame crises. Most things in the game end up being original or different every time you play and I'd hate to see it where a similar strategy becomes common against the endgame threats every time. In any event, Stellaris is very much solid as a base game and definitely adds a new take on the 4x genre by adding some GSG elements to it. However, the GSG elements are dominately on display during the mid game and sorely need some additional fleshing out and substance to make the mid game less of a drag. The early game exploration and late game galactic threats, however, make the game a recommended buy from me. HOWEVER, if you are not the sort of person that doesn't like DLC or want to wait for Stellaris to be more fleshed out and detailed like EU4, CK2, and other Paradox titles have become, I would not suggest Stellaris for the people in the anti-DLC group and recommend those wanting a more definitive experience until Stellaris has been built upon with additional content for the latter group. Rest assured, with how well Stellaris has done so far, it should be clear that Paradox intends to support Stellaris for a long time. Given the resources that Paradox has at its disposal by comparison to other strategy/4x developers, I look forward to seeing what they do with the game in the future. If you enjoy the 4x/GSG genre, I still recommend the game despite its few faults. Have fun storming the galaxy!			"

												It's a lot of fun, multiplayer is where it really shines.I wish there were better options for diplomacy, it's really, really awkward to get right.  More straightforward to aim to be militaristic, ally with friends, sacrefice long term growth for the sake of growing a navy fleet as fast as possible, then blow up the AIs.  You CAN have fairly short games with that strategy.For the purposes of diplomacy, I wish something could be done about border friction with civs that you have cordial relationships with.  Certain traits make it difficult to vassalize\become vassals of, alliance, or allow settlement, giving -1000 points against trade off the bat.   I guess you can trade dozens of planets to offset the balence.  Border friction will almost unvaryingly lead to war towards end game, even with civs you spent time trying to build up a good relationship with.  It seems odd.  Would think there'd be a way to buffer, or create a DMZ\trade zone between friendly nations, or something.I'm still learning the game, there is a lot to it.  I might be missing something. "

												Wonderful game! I guess it's a true successor for a Master of Orion. Nowadays, turn-based stratrgy can't receive a lot of funds, thus it's useless to create it, just becuase it's impossible to create a playable multiplayer when it takes multiple hundreds of turns to win a game (let's see HOMM3, 1 turn takes 20 minutes on pro tournaments, it's so boooring). And Paradox found an excellent solution: they created a real-time stategy, but with slovered time. It's `near-turn-based strategy`, but it's a real-time in the same time! So they saved good old spirit of MOO and others cosmostrats, but maked this game really playable for modern players, which want to play with each other, not with bots. So, congratulations, Paradox, you made my year.Короче ребята, играйте в игру, если вы любители старых Орионов (1-2 части), то эта игра вас как минимум на неделю затянет беспробудно. Что особенно прикольно, до конца игры не смог выбрать все технологии (да и большую часть, наверное, не смог). Нет такого, как в других играх, что ты натечился, построил неубиваемую флотилию и пошел снес. Очень интересная игра "

												One of the best games in the 4X genre so far. Early game is a blast compared to other 4X titles. Grand strategy and event system also adds flavor and variety to the game. The research card system is innovative as it prevents it from being overwhelming yet adds a strategic layer to the game since  each card is weighted depending on what research cards you pick.Mid-game may need further improvements but given its PDX, they will definitely polish this game up even more.

It's very rare that a game lives up to the hype surrounding it's development but Stellaris does.Deep, polished, immersive...a whole bunch of positive adjectives apply to Stellaris.I'm not going to be able to say anything which hasn't been said by others and more eloquently besides.I'll just add my voice to the throng of positive support for this amazing game.I am certain that there are several years worth of expansions, DLC and mods to enjoy in addition to a 10/10 vanilla game.

												Alright, so I bought this game when it became available for Pre-purchase and this is my ""first"" review of a game. After a 24 hours of total playtime, I can tell these:-Gameplay will slow down and sometimes game starts to lag when lots of things happen.(However I believe that Paradox will fix this problem with patches.)-Time-consuming. I mean, literally, last night I wasn't able to sleep at all! ""One more research, one more battle!"" -No ""micromanagemant"" for battles. You can equip your ships with aggressive or defensive computer chips and that's that. You can't order a certain ship to attack another ship. They're all automated.-Planets/Moons become repetitive. After a lot of surveying, you realize that the planets look like each other a lot. (Someone made a video review for this game said they could use some kind of ""random planet generator"".) +Satisfying visuals. They actually done a great job with the stars, blackholes and etc.+Also satisfying micromanagement of your empire. If you have played Civilizations before, you'll get used to it in no time.+Sleek/Simple UI. If you prefer, your robot guide will notify and give you info every time something happens. Very good for learning the basics. +HUGE map. I mean, literally, it so HUGE that you can't keep an eye on everything. LOTS of Empires, LOTS of stuff going on. +Primitive/Superior Civs. You invent FTL and go to space bla bla... When you do that, you may get b*tchslapped right in your face by another empire that was in space WAY LONGER than you do.  Also, you may b*tchslap another civs which may be in Industrial Age, or maybe Bronz Age even. +Detailed race/perks creating. Really, it gives you a lot of options to create your own race. +Very easy and accessible gameplay. What I mean is, you can select a constructor/science ship and order them around by right clicking the ststem/planet/moon etc. Right click, opens up a menu. ""I was like-wuuuuuut"".  Mouse hover info and simple screens make it easier to make ""strategies"". +OST's are really AMAZING. I really care about sounds in a game and Stellaris doesn't disappoint me with that. ""Thank youuu""CONCLUSION: You should buy this game. There are a lot of rooms for modding&DLC's so I guess Paradox will provide gameplay improvements with patches&expansions. "

												While I would still recommend this game, it does feel like it needs a lot of work in fleshing out the game more. The AI empires still feel like they are just there and communicate with you very little. The start is exciting, exploring the unknown, but the sense of exploration gets lost once you have several AI empires discovered near you and space starts to get a little boring. It also seems the AI still needs plenty of work with wars and sectors.On the plus side, this game has plenty of modding potential and the music is great. There is no research tree, instead there is a more interesting and rewarding feel of gaining technology.			"

												I like Stellaris, and that's why it pains me to not recommend it.I've long loved 4x Strategy games, and outside of their DLC policy I've loved Paradox strategy games.There have been so many stories I've made in Stellaris. Hours upon hours of building Galactic Empires filled with inferior xeno slaves, Peaceful Federations of scientific diplomats - anything that came to me on a whim.However, the AI is absolute - and I mean COMPLETE -♥♥♥♥♥♥ It might do attacking well against you and your systems, but outside of that it is entirely braindead. The situation is so bad I made this entire review after a ragequit. A ~200 year campaign as a martial empire, at one point the largest blob on the block, and the strongest outside of the Fallen Empires.It is at this single point that the Unbidden appear to make my day pretty bad. They appear a few systems away from my borders in the heart of the only local empire near my size and strength. I figure things might get bad and the Fox Empire will need some help.Understatement of the century.I'd like to say for the record that I tried to avoid endgame crises spoilers and did not know the Unbidden trick - my upcoming point on AI still stands.The entire 3/4 of my Empire, the Fox Empire, and several smaller empires around us are obliterated by wave upon wave of 60-90k death stacks. At this point I have a single 50k stack and thats pushing the limits of my naval capacity. I fight/lose a protracted genocide of my people and my xeno slaves as they creep ever closer to my homeworld.At this point I'm thinking 'Clearly this is either ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or some Deus Ex Machina will save me during this, right?'Some Fallen Empire answers my prayers and Awakens to fight off the horde sprawling across the galaxy. They have a call-to-arms for an 'alliance' to oppose the horde unified. I immediately jump on board, praying for safety. The caveat? I have to ban slavery across my empire. At this point I'm desperate and accept - significantly cutting in to my already depleted resources - and await for the help that does not come.After calling for a unified alliance and attack against the monsters, the Awakened Empire proceeds to do nothing but war against some two-bit empire in the opposite direction for decades because they're mean or something.I'm one of only two empires that joins the alliance.The Awakened Empire sits with their MULTIPLE 100-200k death stack fleets that could EASILY beat the Unbidden sitting at their planets.My newly slaveless economy is in shambles as I fight delaying actions with an ever weakening fleet as I desperately try to reinforce with every mineral I have, Redesign the fleet to take on the Unbidden, research ANY technology that might even the playing field - including taking an Ascension perk that increased my damage against them by 50%.But nope, too little too late. My fleet was gone. Shambles. The Unbidden take the last of my core worlds as my last two colonies hastily set up next to the Awakened Empire's border get ready to be consumed.Any other empire could have pitched in and fought the obviously more important enemy. Instead they warred amongst themselves as the only thing standing between them and oblivion was consumed from the inside out.But hey at least I got that +150 Opinion 'Mutual threat' buff and constant energy credit trade offers for my strategic resources when I was capped.*Edit*It happened again. One system away from my capital. GG "

												Background: I love Space, Spaceships, Black holes, Star Wars, Star Trek, Sins of a Solar Empire, okay i'm getting off track. I play a lot of 4x games. The Closest space sim I can compare this to is Endless Space if it were Real Time. Learning Curve: This game has a steep unforgiving learning curve similar to Eruopa Universalis IV. My first 15 hours into this game was just trying to wrap my head around all the mechanics. Maybe its just me. Death: So unlike in most games where people are Immortal, your Leaders Die of Old Age. This is a Unique feature of this game.Pre-Game: Like most games you have factions to choose from with a Custom option to make your own. There are pertty limiting choices and there are a number of Workshop addons for increasing the amount of customization. Many just flag changes.Planet Building: Of all the ways to handle planet building, this is one of the better I have see. I guess really I should call it Planet Management. So you have Citizens that all work Squares which can have buildings built on them to increase Sciences, Food, and Crystal. Research: Some have issues with Research because it comes down to your Species Traits and Luck. Like seriously the game takes research a little too realistically. (But that is good in its own way) While on one side it is great to simulate research in a random manner but it can also screw you early game. As an example you get 3 to 5 picks of research depending on your Government and Species Traits, but they are entirely random. So you can go 30 minutes of game time and still have base weapons or shipyards because you can't get the right card to flip for you.  Trust me this can be infuriating.Combat mechanics: It is a combination of Real Time + Staged orbital battles. Real Time Movement until the fleets see each other and engage in a dramatic back and forth sequence of volleys until someone runs or dies. It gets pretty hectic if everyone has close range weapons and once fleet sizes increase.Note: I have not played the Expansion with Leviathians. Final Thoughts: If you can survive the learning curve and odd quirks this game is a very good one,, complicated, but good.As Always watch some gameplay videos before buying!			"

												I found a preFTL industrial fox people civ, I built an Observation station... I do the following...-aggressive observation-infiltration and annexI aggressivly observe them and get 6+ research, then I decide to annex them into my empire... It takes 20-30 years, and they are now apart of the Imperium of Man, Holy Terra, the seat on which the God Emperor recides, all Xenos will be purged...after I enslave them first... put the fox people to work, minerals and energy skyrocket, then when I found 4 more preFTL civs, I purged the fox people, and populate the planet with superior humans. Long live the God Emperor. Stellaris is an amazing empire managment game.. it is advertised as a 4x game, and it is exactly that. Starting off, you can completely customize your empire, mods support at launch makes customizing endless... ye endless spac--- ANYWAY, HERE ARE PROS AND CONS for Stellaris.***PROS****!!!!!!!!!!!!! :DEmpire setting up--- Potentially limitless customization.Visuals--- Its beauitful, well animated, great lighting, great portraits, lots of polish.Sound--- It great, from the sound of different ships, to different weapons, to different worlds when you click on them, hearing a tropical from an arid, to a desert, very awesome.UI--- some people said this is a nightmare, actually its great, there are few things hit and miss, but overall great start to a launch title! (please put UPGRADE ALL on controllable planets...)AI--- the AI is good/bad/great, it really depends, some people say its dumb, no, not really. They declare war on you when you're a threat or they want something, really dependent on what and who they are. But if you see an empire with +14 approval, chances are they aint going to delcare war, as for fleets battles, they run away if they think they are losing, very sins of a solar empire.GAMEPLAY!!!!!!!!!--eXploring is the best out of all 4x titles, your exploring science ship has a leader you choose, who come with their own bonuses and levels, making exploring even better. By exploring you have chances to get technologies, artifacts, info on resources, discovering preFTL civs, other space empires, and giant space creatures. There are three types of FTL, Warpdrive, Hyperdrive and Wormholes, all are unlocked end game, each are better and worse than the other.--eXpand is great, once you are past 5 planets, the game will suggest creating regions, AI managed areas to ease micromanaging, as 4x Vets know the micro hell. You can build stations that extend your influence as far as your FTL can take you. You can set up alliances, or federations with other friendly empires, vassal enemy empires or plain old conquer them to expand. --eXploiting is also fantastic, resources improve your empire that you get from planets, suns, black holes, enslaved aliens/your own people, or dumb/sentient robots who can all rise up against you. Research is very expansive, with three different research areas that throw four-six different techs at you to choose every time a new tech is researched. It is randomized, and pretty fantastic, as it feels fresh every new game.  Ship designer is ok, it only lets you play with the inner workings, which some people may prefer.--eXterminating is straightforward, build giant blob of ships, send ships to kill.    The combat is rock, paper, scissors... A, will be better than B, but worse than C, etc.    Its a good system. There are 6+ empire ship visual variations, more with mods now and in the future.  After you conquer an alien planet, you can choose to purge them. You have three stages of orbitial    bombardment, light, mid, full and the game responds in both audio and visually to the choices.The game also has factions which develop in your empire, If left unchecked, can detach and create their own empire, and can be dealth with in numerous ways, PURGE!!!!!!!!. Diplomacy is quite indepth and has different ways to dealing with an alien empire, alien empires interact with eachother and can if they all hate you, gang up on you.**CONS**............... :(Stellaris does 4x incredibly, but there are things that should be there, which are not...Otherwise I would be still playing. The game is, GREAT GREAT FANTASTIC, but the other side of it, is nothing, nothing, nothing. There is nothing bad about the game, its ridiculously well made, just needs more.1-5 are required, as currently there are better 4x titles out there overall.1.  No Espionage, none---- Huge empires that are pure evil, can only be dealt with an alliance of other empires, other games have this too, however with espionage, you can turn the tide of war. 2.  No Trade lanes/ships, none----- You can setup trade deals with empires that last 10-30 years, but no civilian ships, or industrial ships, flying around your empire, passively increasing relations and economy with alien empires. Without it, it just makes the game look, kind of stagnant, and not living.3.  No more than two ways to get Influence, seeing how Influence is such an important resource in this game, you can only get it by rivaling an enemy empire, or upgrading your planets HQ... It needs more sources, making alliances with empires, federations, taking over an enemy empire and emancipating its slaves, etc.4.  No automation, this is needed, badly, the automation starts at regions, and ends there. When you build a colony ship, it would be amazing to automate it to colonize a colonizable planet within the limit of its FTL... and automate a constructer to just build stations around the empire, and actually automate exploration and discovery... so it can let you focus on the true aspect of Stellaris, which is running your empires inner workings and dealing with aliens. 5.  No key binding change, you cant edit your keys, weird, very weird, Paradox fix this soon.. please.6. No tools to make the game a bit faster.. I love my lengthy games, but as it is right now, its a grind, without a deep mid game like the early game, and more fleshed out end game, it is a grind to go through the pace Paradox wants it to be.. These must be put in, to give the game bigger legs than it has.Below are just crazy ideas.No massive ships, this is more of an addon to make the game even better, than something required. After building a battleship, build dreadnaughts, or a death star to blow up planets, like in Gal Civ 2, there is the terror star and blows up entire systems. I have seen a broken up planet around a black hole in Stellaris, and it was fantastic to look at, this is something that can be done, just to add more eXterminate to the game.No visual variation between alien thrusters on the back of ships, this is tiny, and I think easily changed, but its annoying when there is an alien empire using something that looks very similar to your own.No SUPER indepth terraforming or insane building, you can terraformendgame you should be able to terraform EVERYTHING, screw it, its set in space in the future, technology shouldnt be limited. I want to build rings like the forerunners, and from that have different visual variations for the alien empires, as well as technologically. And or building actual planets, artifically created living worlds.No game changing resource/wonder, wouldnt' it be great if there was something that would change the war around immediately that you randomly found through discovery, something that allows you to either blow up planets or rip them apart for ridiculous amounts of resources.VERDICT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If you're swayed by the prettiness, the polish, the Empire managing complexity, buy this game. If the things that are missing bother you, Id say wait. Overall good game, in a year or two, it will be the defining 4x civ space game, and I will live on it, goodbye life, in 6months/year/two years.Why isnt there a maybe thumb!7/10			"

												Created a new civilisation.Pacific and happy people, ready to trade with anyone, to discuss whith everybody, and to hug any lifeform in the whole universe.Every single extraterrestrial being I met despised me instantly. After 50 years, Four civilisations allied to crush my tiny empire and enslave every single member of my race.Created a new military-driven, power-crazy, xenophobic civilisation.Everybody liked it. They all wanted to ally with me. I built a powerful federation and crushed everything in my path, then I dismantled the federation and waged war upon every former member of it. I rule over a galaxy of slaves. Every revolt is crushed, every dissident is purged. They wanted to be my allies. ""Naive fools"", I think while watching the setting sun on my homeworld. Then I laugh maniacaly.10/10 Most realistic game ever**********EDIT*05*24*2016***************************It has been told, but after a tremendous start, the game tends to become quite dull after three or four hours. In fact, it is as such: Once you've overcome most of the problems that can appear at the beginning of your play (creating an army powerful enough to defend yourself, expanding your borders, producing a fair amount of enrgy and minerals), most of the 10-25 hours of gameplay that will follow will consist in only two possibilities: waging war against one of your neighbours, or spawing colony ships in order to expand your realm. This, and nothing else.  So, as much as I enjoyed a few plays, I have to admit that I'll desperatly wait for the upcoming patches to put some flesh on the core of the gameplay. Or else, this game will gather dust until the first DLC - if it's good enough.			"

												Great!Finally another Game of the grand strategy genre from paradox. My old friend - the clausewitz-engine- makes the pardox strategy special. You got a running timeline but can stop everytime to give orders. I love this mechanic. No rounds but no stress like in RTS games.Well there were many strategy titles from paradox that weren´t beginner friendly, but this time the interface and the tutorial are this good that you don´t have to read any manual first. Many things are self explaining but you will discover as many details later in the game.I also like the huge maps. Even with medium size you got a galaxy with no less than 600 systems!Who likes deep and detailed strategy should buy this game! Even for beginners it´s possible to get into the game.Thumbs up!			"

Pluses:- technology system- very good stories written for anomalies- looks amazing- race creator- government system- stuff you can do: modify genetically species, uplift primitive races, invade, infiltrate or enlighten young civilizations, explore vast space, build a galactic empire, face lategame crisis, meet fallen empires and much more- very stable: didnt crush for me even once both in single and multiplayerMinuses:- on huge galaxy even on great hardware late game perfomance plummets- right now doesnt have enough content for level of replayability of other Paradox games- unbalanced for multiplayerIf your thinking wheather or not to buy it - buy it, you will get your moneys worth and more.

												After being raised on classics like Starcraft and Sins of a Solar Empire, I must admit to being dissappointed by many of the stratagy titles I have purchased over the years. Even the newer releases of Starcraft II and Warcraft III were, in a way, lacking. There just seemed to be something fundamentally different in a way that left a bad taste in my mouth. But you are here to hear about Stellaris. A great game, kinda like if you mixed Civs and SOaSE. Granted, it's no Starcraft, but it should satisfy your hunger for grand scale strategy. This is one of those games that you start at 6am on a Saturday, and shut down your computer at about 9pm on sunday, not even realizing the amount of time you just wasted.If you are still wondering, my suggestion is: BUY IT!!

												A nice hybrid between Paradox's grand strategy games, and a more traditional 4X. The slow early game really helps you learn the systems as your empire expands. Its got a huge number of systems and I haven't even seen any of the late-game ones yet. Make Space Great Again  "

												My religious missionaries discovered a planet populated by truly alien beings...they didn't even have exoskeletons!  They were so primative that they still were not united under a world government, let alone guided by the one true faith.  Our scientist-monks suggested we may learn from close but covert study of the natives, but once you've prodded one fleshy being, you've prodded them all.  Instead, I would send in the missionaries with heavilly modified bodies to infiltrate their governments and bring them into the fold ""willingly"".After years of work (and one missionary deciding to ""go native"" and run away with a hoo-man), we finally welcomed the people of Sol into our benevolent family.  All was well, but there were some whom the light did not wholly illuminate.  I felt that the desire to bask in the light of community and follow the calling of One would bring them into line, but while I was concerned with distant battles with a breakaway sect, sentient crystal beings, and space chickens, the hoo-mans were organizing mass rallies and eventually the riots became open rebellion.  Our peace guard barred the doors of the Temple of Glorious One on Sol, and an expedition was rapidly raised, a huge army of Penitant Troops and an equally massive force of armed spacecraft.  We set out to right this wrong.Once we reached Sol system, we received a last transmission from the Temple as the rioters penetrated its defences and destroyed it.  With heavy hearts I ordered the Penitant Troops to land and bring order to the lawless.  Upon reaching high orbit, the transports learned to their horror that the hoo-mans had built their own fleet in secret...nearly as large as ours...and taken command of the defensive station rotating around the planet.  Every transport blew or burned up, landing on the planet as scattered ashes, soon after followed by our great fleet.  Three corvettes and our War of Peace leader were the only survivors.We had sought to bring the people of Sol into Unity, to teach them about our faith and higher technology.  In return, they doomed our own empire.  Now something...large...is coming our way.  It stretches across space and every star it passes goes dark.  We pray to the One, may She guide us.......Bought game, thankfully on my day off.  Thirteen hours of play later I can say this is seriously addictive.  There is a notable learning curve and I'm constantly learning new things, but this game gets a thumbs up for not just being a 4x, but the most emergent-RP 4x I've played in years.			"

												Stellaris is in a nutshell, one of the most optomized games i have ever seen in recent....ok a long time. At launch i found no problems, the game ran so smooth even on my Potatoe. Combat is just stellar to watch, flashing light, colors, and majestic ships flying about in a dance to the death. Creating your own race to rule the stars, Have a 110 year old Mushroom control the fate of his people. The game is wow, and after looking through the negative reviews, all i see is comparisons to other games. The main comparisons are Crusader kings 2 and Europa Universalis 4, Claiming both games have significantly more deapth. My question to them is, how much depth did either game have at release compared to this game? Stellaris release with so much content and the dev already outlined the major concerns the community has. Depth was added to CK2 and EU4, Stellaris has some depth and will only get more with time.Mostly everyone who reviewed it on its own merits gave it positive reviews. The question comes down to would you recommend this game? If you want to subjegate humans, be annihalated by parrots, or form a alliance consisting only of reptiles and call it the COLD BLOODED COALITION....Then start a COLD WAR....Then don't hesitate to pick up the game. If you don't like 4X or Grand stradegy, probably not the game for you, but i say give it a shot.This game is good and will likely stand on its own for a LOOOOOOOONG Time			"

												This game is wonderful for those who like strategy games, though as with all games, a few cons arise. But my main one is sectors, I prefer to micro-manage my worlds, so if you're like me, you'll want to get an unlimited core world mod, but that is the only real gripe I have with i other than since the recent update continental worlds haave different colored landmasses, some look wonderful, like bright gree, dull green, or a gray, but red and purple look stupid, however I am not 100% confident this isn't a graphics mod.

												The base game is pretty good, though it is missing alot of meat that makes a good grand strategy game which will likely be remedied with dlc in the future and hopefully it gets the same treatment as CK2 and EU4 in that category.The soundtrack is great and fits the theme perfectly. Maybe a military republic soundtrack DLC like starship troopers-like would be awesome. "

												Stellaris... I have certainly played a lot of this game, and it keeps drawing me back. I play an empire for a while, I get to certain point, get bored, and start over. I try a different route, looking for another way to play the game, get a jump on my previous empire, and hopefully get closer to the ultimate goal of victory. I have played both single player and multiplayer, both of which have equivalent appeal for me.I find the gameplay quite enjoyable most of the time, but this game does have some annoying features, particularly when trying to actually achieve victory. They have made a lot of changes to this game since its release, looking for ways to balance the gameplay. For each update, some of it make a lot of sense, and some of it makes you scratch your head.In this game, you are playing as a sentient species, just having reached space travel potential, and now attempting to build your galactic empire. There are a lot of different ways to customize your species and government to match your style of play, and it makes it a lot of fun to try out different government / species combinations.The game has 6 very important resources that you must gain:1. Minerals - These are used to build most everything in the game.2. Energy - Almst everything you build has an upkeep cost, and that cost generally comes in the form of energy.3. Influence - Influence is necessary for everything you really want to accomplish, such as different diplomatic treaties, colonizing new planets, building forntier outposts to extend your range, and constructing the best buildings in your colonies. It is also the most difficult resource to obtain.4. Physics research points - necessary for new technologies. A lot of weapons and ship enhancements fall into this category.5. Society research points - necessary for new technologies. Includes research that improves your infuence gain, options available to your government, and the ability to colonize world types other than your initial world type.6. Engineering research points - also necessary for new technologies. Includes a lot fo ship enhancements and buildings for your colonies.The gameplay itself consists of the following: 1. Constructing buildings in your colonies. 2. Directing your science ships to explore the galaxy, finding new planets and resources.3. Directing your construction ships to build stations, which can bring you every type of resource other than influence.4. Clearing hostiles out of systems so that your science and construction ships can get into them.5. Colonizing new worlds. Colony ships are particularly taxing on your energy income.6. Choosing which researches to pursue.7. Governing your empire by acquiring and directing leader figures and trying different edicts and policies.8. Dealing with other empires, whether through diplomatic actions or war.I enjoy each facet of the gameplay, and constantly try to maximize the growth of my empire.For me, the game has been capturing and fun until you get to a certain point. Maintaing a solid influence income and getting enough to pursue your goals are a major annoyance in this game. Early in the game, stacking up hordes of influence is easy, but the more you expand, the harder it is to maintain. The 1.2 update creatd some additional influence costs that didn't exist previously, such as the cost to colonize new worlds or enter into defensive pacts with other empires. This was intended to ""balance the mid-game"", but all it does is make the mid-game drag on forever and become more of an annoyance. Frontier outposts, used to expand your borders without building colonies, are pretty much obsolete after the 1.2 update. Each one costs you one infuence point per month, and that cost is now impossible to maintain with all that you need to spend the infuence on. Building these will actually hurt your ability to expand in the long run, kind of defeating their purpose.Diplomacy can be difficult. I have found that the only way for me to really get allies in this game is to give away one sided research agreements or resources, quickly improving my relations. Then I get them to agree to a migration treaty, which will build trust. After that, only if we have the same war philosophy, can I make an alliance happen. 1.2 made alliances a lot more difficult to setup, as war philosophy plays too major of a role. Player alliances in multiplayer are a lot easier to setup, but the influence cost can hinder your progress.Annoyances aside, this game has so much to manage, and such deep core gameplay, that its appeal to fans of the strategy / simulation genres is similar to a peace of meat being dangled in front of a hungry canine, while their mouth fills with overwhelming amounts of saliva, dripping all over the place. Sadly, this game never lets you get that tasty morsel. However, that hasn't stopped me from trying. I epect paradox to continue listening to player feedback, and further attempt to improve the game, while also releasing DLC that adds more depth to a game that already has deep gameplay. They have a great group of developers and have shown dedication to their games previously. I am probably going to play right after I post this review, so I have to reccomend this game to fans of the strategy and simulation genres. Keep trying, my friends. I hope that someday you taste victory.			"

												My overall rating is more neutral than positive.Good things:- First part of the game. This is the strongest portion of the whole story. Many planets to check, aliens, races, events, tasks, etc. Very nice first hours for sure.- Ship and station design. Nice and interesting.- A lot of soft micromanagement in ethics, attitudes, etc. I have never seen similar depth.Bad things.- Limit of planets to manage. You need to form sectors but after that you have limited or no control on them. Also, nightmare to find planets within the sector.- Mid-game boring. Nothing happens. No events or stories or tasks, just waiting for 40-70 months to research something.- Diplomacy and trade with other races is limited.- Influence special resource is needed to hire leaders or colonise planets. You gain 1....3 per month. Very slow.- What is the aim of the game...? Ascend to somewhere? Swipe all the other races? OR what? Maybe a full story is needed in the intro.- Space combat is nonsense. You cannot give order to your fleet. You drop the fleet into the star system and the ships start to attack the strongest enemy. Then, when they almost win, leave the enemy alive and turn to the next strongest one. This way simply lost all the ships. Only way to control them: order retreat. But this way you loose   percent of your ship hull.I recommend the game but wait for a DLC to solve the space combat control and the sector management issues.			"

												So, after spending a lot of time in Stellaris I think that this is definitely my new favorite 4X game of all time, replacing Sins of a Solar Empire before it and Galactic Civilizations 2 before that.  Stellaris is mostly the same compared to those games, and could be considered a bit boring compared to Sins, but it has a lot of potential that Paradox is already bringing to the table.  Keep in mind this review was written after the release of 1.4 and before 1.5, which looks to add an impressive list of changes to the game.  While I wouldn't recommend this game to a complete newcomer to the genre, old fans will find a lot to love here: Menus are plenty, planets have building slots and a space station to build upon, fleets are very customizable, and the tech system is the absolute best thing about this game so far.  For anyone interested in playing a longform 4X, Stellaris can keep you interested for quite a while with endgame crises that will challenge the capability of your end game fleets, as well as managing a large empire and ensuring you are the dominant force in the galaxy.  10/10 though and would recommend to anyone else interested in the 4X genre, but not a game for the newcomers.

												For ~$40 CDN, I think the value of this is absolutely fantastic. I'm simply engrossed by this game. There are no performance issues, as it's not particularly demanding/taxing on hardware. That said, If you're a Crossfire/SLI person, you might need to disable it. (Negative scaling it seems, unfortunately. Though there is no need for the extra horsepower anyway). The game has a perfect blend of complexity and intricacy, without being overwhelming. Even at latter stages of gameplay, it always manages to...keep things interesting. By the gods, MOD/Workshop SUPPORT!!! Devs are great at releasing regular patches, and other content updates. (Sky...spaceboxes? ftw!)If you're one of those folks who likes to get drunk while playing a strategy or 4X game, this is the game for you. (Beer+Games+Beer). Again, at around $40 CDN, the value is unbeatable. Go buy it.			"

												Only 20 hours in and I'm having a blast!Is it worth the price tag? Yes! If you like 4X Grand Strategy games. This one will not disappoint!Gameplay 9/10Very easy to use interface. Zooming in and out, scrolling side to side is a breeze. So much to do! Its a very detailed and indepth experience. You can setup at the beginning of each game up to 1000 star systems and several alien races to inhabit them. You can also customize different races to your play style. The only knock I have on actaul gameplay is the battles really arent very attractive. Hopefully they will improve a little bit on this as the updates and DLC follow as expected.Audio 10/10Its one hell of an eargasm! Reminds of the Mass Effect days a little bit. Great soundtrack! Not much else to say.Graphics 8/10Really good game to feast your eyes upon. Like I said earlier, my only knock on the game are the battles. Was hoping they would be a little more on the great to epic scale.Multiplayer N/AI really wasn't expecting one. I suppose its a nice added bonus. I prefer the single player experience honestly.Overall, Its the best 4X game I have ever played and I'm a big X series fan. If you are looking for a long real-time/pause strategy game. Get this one. It won't let you down. ~Also, I must add they offer mod support. Pretty cool!			"

The 1.2 update creatd some additional influence costs that didn't exist previously, such as the cost to colonize new worlds or enter into defensive pacts with other empires. This was intended to ""balance the mid-game"", but all it does is make the mid-game drag on forever and become more of an annoyance. Frontier outposts, used to expand your borders without building colonies, are pretty much obsolete after the 1.2 update. Each one costs you one infuence point per month, and that cost is now impossible to maintain with all that you need to spend the infuence on. Building these will actually hurt your ability to expand in the long run, kind of defeating their purpose.Diplomacy can be difficult. I have found that the only way for me to really get allies in this game is to give away one sided research agreements or resources, quickly improving my relations. Then I get them to agree to a migration treaty, which will build trust. After that, only if we have the same war philosophy, can I make an alliance happen. 1.2 made alliances a lot more difficult to setup, as war philosophy plays too major of a role. Player alliances in multiplayer are a lot easier to setup, but the influence cost can hinder your progress.Annoyances aside, this game has so much to manage, and such deep core gameplay, that its appeal to fans of the strategy / simulation genres is similar to a peace of meat being dangled in front of a hungry canine, while their mouth fills with overwhelming amounts of saliva, dripping all over the place. Sadly, this game never lets you get that tasty morsel. However, that hasn't stopped me from trying. I epect paradox to continue listening to player feedback, and further attempt to improve the game, while also releasing DLC that adds more depth to a game that already has deep gameplay. They have a great group of developers and have shown dedication to their games previously. I am probably going to play right after I post this review, so I have to reccomend this game to fans of the strategy and simulation genres. Keep trying, my friends. I hope that someday you taste victory.			"

												My overall rating is more neutral than positive.Good things:- First part of the game. This is the strongest portion of the whole story. Many planets to check, aliens, races, events, tasks, etc. Very nice first hours for sure.- Ship and station design. Nice and interesting.- A lot of soft micromanagement in ethics, attitudes, etc. I have never seen similar depth.Bad things.- Limit of planets to manage. You need to form sectors but after that you have limited or no control on them. Also, nightmare to find planets within the sector.- Mid-game boring. Nothing happens. No events or stories or tasks, just waiting for 40-70 months to research something.- Diplomacy and trade with other races is limited.- Influence special resource is needed to hire leaders or colonise planets. You gain 1....3 per month. Very slow.- What is the aim of the game...? Ascend to somewhere? Swipe all the other races? OR what? Maybe a full story is needed in the intro.- Space combat is nonsense. You cannot give order to your fleet. You drop the fleet into the star system and the ships start to attack the strongest enemy. Then, when they almost win, leave the enemy alive and turn to the next strongest one. This way simply lost all the ships. Only way to control them: order retreat. But this way you loose   percent of your ship hull.I recommend the game but wait for a DLC to solve the space combat control and the sector management issues.			"

												So, after spending a lot of time in Stellaris I think that this is definitely my new favorite 4X game of all time, replacing Sins of a Solar Empire before it and Galactic Civilizations 2 before that.  Stellaris is mostly the same compared to those games, and could be considered a bit boring compared to Sins, but it has a lot of potential that Paradox is already bringing to the table.  Keep in mind this review was written after the release of 1.4 and before 1.5, which looks to add an impressive list of changes to the game.  While I wouldn't recommend this game to a complete newcomer to the genre, old fans will find a lot to love here: Menus are plenty, planets have building slots and a space station to build upon, fleets are very customizable, and the tech system is the absolute best thing about this game so far.  For anyone interested in playing a longform 4X, Stellaris can keep you interested for quite a while with endgame crises that will challenge the capability of your end game fleets, as well as managing a large empire and ensuring you are the dominant force in the galaxy.  10/10 though and would recommend to anyone else interested in the 4X genre, but not a game for the newcomers.

												Great!Finally another Game of the grand strategy genre from paradox. My old friend - the clausewitz-engine- makes the pardox strategy special. You got a running timeline but can stop everytime to give orders. I love this mechanic. No rounds but no stress like in RTS games.Well there were many strategy titles from paradox that weren´t beginner friendly, but this time the interface and the tutorial are this good that you don´t have to read any manual first. Many things are self explaining but you will discover as many details later in the game.I also like the huge maps. Even with medium size you got a galaxy with no less than 600 systems!Who likes deep and detailed strategy should buy this game! Even for beginners it´s possible to get into the game.Thumbs up!			"

Ofcourse, more futures so i would call it 2nd part of the Endless Space game, feels that they just made a better parody. Whats much sh1_tty in this part:- Science tree, not easy to realise what you researching, i mean to where it come after these few researches- Even if it's bigger than Endless Space you have the same limitsAbout the same things:- Ships modeling system - Space feeling- Graphics- Even menu- Start with creating race or chosing one of themIts all the same and many other..I think it's the best space RTS now after Starcraft 2 FOR ME.I would say it's 9/10, no lags for me anymore after 1st hotfixMy hardware:AMD Radeon R9 290AMD FX(tm)-8120 Eight-Core Processor (8 CPUs), ~3.1GHz8 GB RAM			"

												At first glance Stellaris looks intimidating and daunting. There's such a wide variety of interfaces, choices, customizations and so forth that enables you to truly craft the empire and species of your nerdiest sci-fi dreams. Stellaris is really all of your favorite sci-fi elements and films roled into one package and the combinations are endless. Mass drivers, missles, torpedoes, lasers... you pick, all of these are available for you to focus your empires combat effectiveness.Also as a side note, one of the most under-mentioned and truly epic pieces of this game, is the amazing soundtrack. You have orchestral and synthetic sounds of superb quality.After having spent 50 hours the last two weeks binging on stellaris, and having one game run 200 years, I am starting to notice a pattern develop. While every game is truly unique and totally different from the last, Stellaris starts to become much more familiar and easier the more you play it. Much like Crusader Kings 2. You'll be focused on balancing your economy at first, then getting your tech up to snuff. Neglect one and a militant facist religous empire may wipe you off the map in less than 100 years. If you manage to survive into the mid game you'll be faced with a series of choices for your techs that may or may not end the galaxy. The late game as far as I have witnessed is spent trying to clean up an end game crisis and reach that victory condition of 40% control.The only downside I have for this game is after awhile it feels a bit bare bones. No civilian trade lanes. Combat is basic, your swarm of ships vs my swarm of ships, usually highest value wins. No other victory conditions besides conquest (hard if your a pacifist). Terraforming is very limited. Diplomacy is very limited. Options to bring an empire into your fold are limited and so forth. All of these things have been noted by the community and I have full faith in Paradox that these will be addressed in the future.I know over time as Paradox always does, this game will be fleshed out and probably end up completely different than it is now in two years. Paradox has started with a great initial package, truly nailing what every nerd has been wanting for so long in a stagnate genre. 8/10. Buy it. The galaxy is yours.			"

												Fantastic game. Definitely strong in the 4X realm. It contains all the elements I feel make a good strategy game, and attempt to set it up in a way that your empire doesn't become too unwieldy when you have hundreds of planets.The musical score is incredibly beautiful, rarely do I encounter a game where the score feels so fitting to the game and generally good in quality overall.Cons include a variety of difficulties working with federations, a low number of traits and flexibility for certain things, less space alien encounters than I expected given the large variety of other items (I guess this should be something I don't complain about considering the overall quantity of content). Also there aer some graphical issues, such as the glowing effects of shields on ships turning your fleet into a glowing blob you can't see anything of detail in, and slowing down some graphics cards. Also combat is a bit two dimensional.Overall, very highly recommend this game for strategy lovers!			"

												It has potential, that's for sure.My main complaints is: -The amazingly stupid sector management AI which can't even put slaves and robots in the correct tiles. They keep putting them to farm energy credits and research points while ignoring the fact that slaves and robots (except synthetics) have disadvantages to farm it.-Non-existent diplomacy. It's so simple it hurts. Declare war, trade resources, declare rivalry, insult them. Just that. As for the casus belli for war, currently the choices are very limited. Giving only 3 choices; cede planet, vassalize, or liberate some of their planets.The only part I definitely love playing is the early-game stage, you'd be surprised at what events the game will throw at you when you start to explore the galaxy. The mid-game? It's your average Europa Universalis IV, but imagine it without any DLC. Yeah, that's it. Here's what you do during mid-game:-Build ships.-Wait for your tech research to complete.-Upgrade your ships with the latest weapons you acquired from research.-Declare war.Rinse and repeat, since there's no other thing except warring other states to ""win"" this game.Late-game stage is bugged. Foreign invaders? Sure thing, the AI doesn't even fight them! Except for Fallen Empires, that is. I still remember when the Unbidden appears, it only gave opinion bonus to all AI states, making them forming federation here and there. But because of that federation, they won't declare war to each other since they're locking each other. That creates a horribly static galaxy which nothing happens, even when Unbidden starts swallowing those states, they don't do anything!Then again, it's not like I hate this game or something, but currently it feels like an incomplete game. Perhaps in a year or so, when PDS releases some DLCs for this it'll be as good as CK2 or EU4, or even Vicky 2.			"

												Really enjoying playing this grand epic space adventure.  Fortunate enough to recieve as a gift I have played it almost non-stop and recommend this title to those who enjoy the Galciv type games.  Gameplay is smooth and relaxed with the emphasis on exploration and empire building.  Ship to ship combat is simple and maybe not complex enough for some folks as you have no direct control over individual craft.  The ship designer is incredibly simple to use and again may not offer enough depth to some but for the older gamers like myself it works fine and does the job without the hassle of trying to fit the 14th hyper-thrust port valve to the 9th intake-valve flange-junction, without the ion flux reductor, of course.This game has kept me amused for hours on end with it's melodic soundtrack, gorgeous visuals, the dry wit of the tutorial narrating robot and the random quest pop-ups.I cannot wait to see what the developers do with this game as it is wide open for expansion and DLC content to further enhance the playability and replayability of the title.  I hasten to add I did not struggle to get immersed in the game nor have I found any showstopper bugs.. plenty of alien bugs, sure.You can create your own faction to take to the stars or use a pre-determined empire but you have a massive amount of options to forge your own little space based bunch of psychopaths or a collective cuddle circle if you so wish by utilising the varied traits.Grab it and dive in, put a few hours of your life on hold as you behold the majesty of the galaxy before you.

												I have been playing Paradox games for some years now, and despite being a very loyal fan and supporter of their historical grand strategy game series, I have generally followed the ""wait until a couple expansions"" rule of thumb with their games. I purchased Stellaris because it was the first new franchise from Paradox in some time and was looking for a new strategy game outlet.  I am not a sci-fi game fan for any genre and I am aware of the varying states of polish associated with new releases.  That said, this game is out-of-the-box fun.  The exploration component remains a consistent element of the game well through mid-game and depth of different component systems; from ship design to technological progress to diplomacy and planet planning and developement are all well thought out systems and well executed.  There is sufficient enough differences betwen the pre-start choices of ethics and species talents to create an asymetical feel from one species/empire to another.  The procedural generation of the worlds is not overly balanced, which present frustrations (e.g. not enough minernals near starting star systems can be a real drag on early game building capacities) but it also prevents cookie cutter, scripted opening strategies and pushes the player to adapt to the strategic map as it is unveiled.  This keeps you thinking from game to game and evolving new approaches to handle complex and emerging landscapes.   Overall, despite being a new release without supplemental dlc to flesh our and refine, this game in its current state stands as one of the most complete and deep vanilla Paradox games I have played to date.  I am enjoying it now and look forward to watching it continue to evolve.  Well done, Paradox.  Your commitment to releasing games in a finished state is changing perceptions and your willingness to take the risk associated with launching a new franchise appears to be on its way to paying off.

												I really am enjoying this title. I bought it last night and played a good few hours, but I'm going to start over as I somehow enraged an alien race that is messing up my progression. The game has a lot going for it:Beautiful graphicsGreat looking shipsComplex research trees, with leveling scientists and things like that.I'm not sure I like how aggressive the AI is, and by no means am I complaining nor am I an expert at these kinds of titles, but the AI sure grew hostile and territorial before I had a chance to do much in terms of expansion or defense... In my new game I'm going to set the AI aggressive nature on low and I hope that helps as I really want to learn how to play before fighting meanie aliens and such...This has that one more turn feeling and though my hours in it are thus far few, I can see myself playing this game happily, and contentedly, for hundreds of hours!!!I give it a big thumbs up...

												As far as Paradox games go, this is very approachable and immediately has payoffs. The tutorial is fine, but of course these types of games aren't for everyone. I really can't think of a way to say this nicely, but if you lack a certain base level of knowledge and capacity for learning (and enjoying a process of trial and error to do so) you should steer clear of this developer. That being said, these games stretch your capacity and have meaningful moments of feeling you have truly accomplished something. If everyone could easily accomplish something, doesn't it lose its value? Conquer the obtuse nature of this game and your reward will be plentiful :)			"

If you hate using the steam workshop to mod your game and love just playing vanilla, you will probably get a total of 10 or so hours of gameplay before you forget about this game- as it depends on more and more mods and the updates from the devs.			"

												Stellaris - Review // UPDATE 1.1Stellaris strikes me as a very refreshing, yet pleasantly familiar space 4X at the same time and reminds me the most of a very ancient DOS-based 4X called Ascendancy.It just so happens that Ascendancy was also the very first 4X I have ever played in my life, and it also happens that very few other space 4X's after that managed to keep my attention as long as that one in nearly twenty years.But with Stellaris, the whole thing is back. Forget GalCiv 3, forget MoO. Stellaris does it all, does it right, and probably has the most reliable and supreme patch support after release of all three. DLC? No - major updates for free, and you will only pay for actual new content and only if you really want to - not because the deeper game mechanics actually force you to. Paradox approaches games the way they should be approached: as a living product that is never truly perfect. Evidenced by not only their own patch and aftersale support history, but also by enabled Mod Support from day one.The base game Stellaris is a feature-rich and feature-complete 4X that offers, starting with update 1.1 ""Clarke"", some of the most interesting AI/diplomacy strategies, and a micro-to-macro style of gameplay that is perfectly in sync with the way your stellar empire grows in size (over time, the game allows you to move micro managing to 'Sectors' that are auto-governed and puts a soft cap on the number of planets you have direct control of).All of the above still leaves one of the most enticing and cool bits of this game behind: the absolutely brilliant writing. Literally every trigger, every event and every action is meaningful, well narrated and invites you to immerse yourself in your space empire. Combined with the absolute freedom in your rise to power, this gives the otherwise 100% random generated universe great body and context.If I were to name one drawback of the game, it's that you can't press 'One more turn'... You just end up looking at the clock at some point, which is usually a bunch of hours later than you really intended to.			"

												I have never play Crusader Kings or EU.   Judging by this game I really probably should have. Paradox have gaming legendary status as far as Im concerned. This game is immense and so widely varied that it really is difficult to explain. The learning curve although steep is so rewarding you wont care. Im not sure that this can be classified as a 4X game, sure its got alot of the same dynamics but it does not play nor does it feel like any 4x game I have played before.For one thing there are no turns.  Everything just ticks along like you would expect from an RTS game.... but omg the things you can do!!Uplifting primative species, genetically modifiying captured species or even your own....  Not into GMO people, never fear once you research a few techs they will do it to themselves!!  How about enslaving an entire specie?  Not into slavery, never mind, you can purge them if they become a problem...galactic genocide with the click of a mouse...... this is how a god must feel right before getting his smite on.Dont like the colour of that planet, its all good, just terraform it to meet your asthetic needs.  Or send one of the aliens living on your planets who quite enjoys living in a barren wasteland.....  Go forth sand alien!  I have enslaved, purged, enriched, integrated, allied, betrayed, triumphed and fought wars with almost every specie in the galaxy and still the game continues to throw new things at you. Oh feeling happy with your 30 planet empire?  See that enormously advanced, armed to the teeth military isolationist fallen empire to the south of  your borders, yeah the ones you have ignored for the last three centuries, yeah them, well they dont like you anymore..... Standby to receive aft! If your lucky enough to have anything resembling an empire after they are through with you how about defending against a galactic scourge that inhales planets like a morbidly obese man savaging iced donuts! I might end up playing this forever..... I cannot recommed this game enough. Get it.   "

												First of all I am going to say that this game is amazing. It has a scope no other Paradox game to date has had and now encompasses an entire Galaxy not just planet earth. For Paradox's first venture into space it is magnificent, capturing both 4x style games and the Paradox feel. The game is by far the easiest to pick up, shedding the previous  annoyances of learning games Victoria II or Hearts of Iron 3. In my first 25 or so hours I have played around 4 games. The first three were unmodded and were mainly learning mechanisms for the different travelling styles and weapon types as well as different Tech orders. I switched from Avian slavers to Reptilian warriors and then to Tech obsessed penguins. However this is not what made the game the best 4x out there, no not all. Whilst the game is fun, ituitive and nicely paced ; the real reason Stellaris is a gem is due to the fact that it is so easy to mod. During the first week I was able to find a mod that allowed my Humans to look like Soviet esque pops and also managed to find a soviet style emblems and name lists. After this I delved back in to my 4th game as the Soviet Union....in space. My leader is Vladamir Lenin who is now 108 years old and still going, and my empire has managed to become the most industrialised out there. Being able to create and customise races and governments to create your own civilisations is what makes the game amazing. The immersion and roleplaying effects are immense and you can really feel for your fledgling Empire as it takes its first steps into space. For this reason alone I am going to say this game has to be on the top of your list of buys. But with the game mechanics being so smooth and the game so addictive I would have to say buy it now! Also 9.5/10			"

												Really enjoying playing this grand epic space adventure.  Fortunate enough to recieve as a gift I have played it almost non-stop and recommend this title to those who enjoy the Galciv type games.  Gameplay is smooth and relaxed with the emphasis on exploration and empire building.  Ship to ship combat is simple and maybe not complex enough for some folks as you have no direct control over individual craft.  The ship designer is incredibly simple to use and again may not offer enough depth to some but for the older gamers like myself it works fine and does the job without the hassle of trying to fit the 14th hyper-thrust port valve to the 9th intake-valve flange-junction, without the ion flux reductor, of course.This game has kept me amused for hours on end with it's melodic soundtrack, gorgeous visuals, the dry wit of the tutorial narrating robot and the random quest pop-ups.I cannot wait to see what the developers do with this game as it is wide open for expansion and DLC content to further enhance the playability and replayability of the title.  I hasten to add I did not struggle to get immersed in the game nor have I found any showstopper bugs.. plenty of alien bugs, sure.You can create your own faction to take to the stars or use a pre-determined empire but you have a massive amount of options to forge your own little space based bunch of psychopaths or a collective cuddle circle if you so wish by utilising the varied traits.Grab it and dive in, put a few hours of your life on hold as you behold the majesty of the galaxy before you.

												I have been playing Paradox games for some years now, and despite being a very loyal fan and supporter of their historical grand strategy game series, I have generally followed the ""wait until a couple expansions"" rule of thumb with their games. I purchased Stellaris because it was the first new franchise from Paradox in some time and was looking for a new strategy game outlet.  I am not a sci-fi game fan for any genre and I am aware of the varying states of polish associated with new releases.  That said, this game is out-of-the-box fun.  The exploration component remains a consistent element of the game well through mid-game and depth of different component systems; from ship design to technological progress to diplomacy and planet planning and developement are all well thought out systems and well executed.  There is sufficient enough differences betwen the pre-start choices of ethics and species talents to create an asymetical feel from one species/empire to another.  The procedural generation of the worlds is not overly balanced, which present frustrations (e.g. not enough minernals near starting star systems can be a real drag on early game building capacities) but it also prevents cookie cutter, scripted opening strategies and pushes the player to adapt to the strategic map as it is unveiled.  This keeps you thinking from game to game and evolving new approaches to handle complex and emerging landscapes.   Overall, despite being a new release without supplemental dlc to flesh our and refine, this game in its current state stands as one of the most complete and deep vanilla Paradox games I have played to date.  I am enjoying it now and look forward to watching it continue to evolve.  Well done, Paradox.  Your commitment to releasing games in a finished state is changing perceptions and your willingness to take the risk associated with launching a new franchise appears to be on its way to paying off.

												Love this game. I have played both Multiplayer and single player and although they are both fun, for my playstyle I prefer the relaxing slow pace of the single player campaign. This game only is getting better and another huge positive for some is the fact you dont need a top of the line computer to enjoy it. While building my new PC it was one of the few games I was able to completely enjoy without any lag or issues while not even having a gfx card in my system. The onboard integrated gfx of my I5 processor handled it fine. Now with my Nvidia 970 I am able to zoom in to the battles and it looks pretty awesome.Price is also great btw. Most new titles cost over 50.00 but this company sells their games at a reasonable 39.99 price point.			"

												A very good modernization of the old gam called Stars! from 1996. Exactly what you'd expect from a modernized epic. Also similar at times with Ascendancy, another pre 2000 title.One of the best ""turn based"" strategy games I've ever played. Very fun at the start. Some crazy surprises along the way. Awesome use of various, well known Sci-Fi  references. Makes Civilization V not fun to play in contrast :). The race customization features are awesome. Amazing game overall. However the negative reviews have a point as well. Was launched incomplete and full of bugs. Combat could be better. AI and interactions could be better. Certain mechanics could be less restrictive ( federations, aliances, hostile uplifted civs ). UX could be better in some areas. I wish they wouldn't have released it so broken, I spent most of the hours I'll spend on this game in buggy saves.			"

												I have enjoyed this game and would like to write a detailed review but so far have enjoyed exploration, events and scale of the game. Have seen better space battles and diplomacy, I may never get to give a complete review of this game due to time constraints, but do want to leave some form a review based on what I have played so far. The best way to do this would be to write up my last experience playing Stellaris.Late evening loaded up the game, played for about an hour then heard the cries of my 7 month old daughter, got her up and held her while shushing her to sleep. While holding her decided to listen to the music with the lights out, ended up listening to the music for about 90 minutes wondering if the baby in my arms would ever get to travel stars and visit other worlds. When I was sure she was asleep put her back in her crib and went to bed myself. Based on that experience I would have to say best music score yet. Will try to get a more detailed review of gameplay when she’s 5 (years). Thumbs up so far! "

												Stellaris is a  great game. It draws elements from Civilization, Master of Orion, and Sins of a Solar Empire, without feeling like a clone of any one of those games. It is real time, but it almost feels turn-based because you can adjust the speed and pause at any time (and yes, you can continue to issue orders while paused.)There is a bit of a learning curve, even if you are a master of the aforementioned games, so please do yourself a favor and click the ""full tutorial"" button when you start your first several games. There are a lot of nuances and advanced concepts, (such as genetically modifying races) that you are not going to figure out on your own - you need the instructions the first time or two.There are a few bugs which need to be worked out, but the ones I encountered were all very minor and did not impact gameplay much (for example, I encountered a situation where the random name generators stopped working and I had to restart to fix it, and another situation where I had a strategic resource and it showed up in my resource bar, but when trying to construct something which required that resource, the game was telling me I did not possess the resource.)

												I can't stop playing this game so far. It's far more in depth than any strategy game i've played so far in the space category anyway. Being able to start from knowing of nothing outside your solar system, all the way to running your own empire/federation is fantastic. I still can't get past how cool it is to come across a primitive civilazation and be able to study them and if your will demands it even giving them the knowledge to become a space faring race themselves. At almost 20 hours I still feel like i'm just scraping the surface because there's so much to explore. I think it's a must buy if you love space or any kind or strategy style games.			"

												Very interesting game so far. If you've played some of the other Paradox games many of the conventions used in the population management will be very familiar. I'd rate it higher than any other Space exploration/civ buidling game i've bought to date. It can get a little dry mid game but by end game the action ramps up. Great game all around, good performance and no game killing bugs that i've found so far.			"

												I was skeptical about Stellaris at first-- I loved Civ (etc) but could never really find my 'niche' in space games outside of Sins of a Solar Empire. Stellaris is everything I love about Civ mixed with Sins of a Solar Empire and made into a space-4X/Grand Strategy.I've thoroughly enjoyed this game. It's fun to play alone and with friends (with liberal use of the ""fastest"" speed)			"

												This game is by far one of the best of paradox's games. Paradox games are infamous for having a steep learning curve for new players and being hard to learn. If you have ever played games like Civ5, you will see similarities between these two games. This is seriously what Beyond Earth should have been. I can't wait until dlc comes out and expands the game even more. I highly recommend.			"

												Love this game. I have played both Multiplayer and single player and although they are both fun, for my playstyle I prefer the relaxing slow pace of the single player campaign. This game only is getting better and another huge positive for some is the fact you dont need a top of the line computer to enjoy it. While building my new PC it was one of the few games I was able to completely enjoy without any lag or issues while not even having a gfx card in my system. The onboard integrated gfx of my I5 processor handled it fine. Now with my Nvidia 970 I am able to zoom in to the battles and it looks pretty awesome.Price is also great btw. Most new titles cost over 50.00 but this company sells their games at a reasonable 39.99 price point.			"

												A very good modernization of the old gam called Stars! from 1996. Exactly what you'd expect from a modernized epic. Also similar at times with Ascendancy, another pre 2000 title.One of the best ""turn based"" strategy games I've ever played. Very fun at the start. Some crazy surprises along the way. Awesome use of various, well known Sci-Fi  references. Makes Civilization V not fun to play in contrast :). The race customization features are awesome. Amazing game overall. However the negative reviews have a point as well. Was launched incomplete and full of bugs. Combat could be better. AI and interactions could be better. Certain mechanics could be less restrictive ( federations, aliances, hostile uplifted civs ). UX could be better in some areas. I wish they wouldn't have released it so broken, I spent most of the hours I'll spend on this game in buggy saves.			"

												Ok, this is a pretty good base game. A bit pricey for what it is there but knowing its paradox there WILL be more content added to flesh it out. Base game? Yes, like all paradox titles, they seem to design them in a modular way, constantly expanding the mechanics as time goes on. This means at release you are getting what feels like a bare bones experience.Stellaris is no different. Its enjoyable as is but obviously needs work and improvement. Personally I am holding off now for more content to round out the experience after sating my initial joy at the grand strategy kings designing a 4x.Just about recommended for now, altho the price is high for what is there. More than likely highly recommended when some more content is added, mechanics are improved/added and the ui is sorted out.			"

												After being raised on classics like Starcraft and Sins of a Solar Empire, I must admit to being dissappointed by many of the stratagy titles I have purchased over the years. Even the newer releases of Starcraft II and Warcraft III were, in a way, lacking. There just seemed to be something fundamentally different in a way that left a bad taste in my mouth. But you are here to hear about Stellaris. A great game, kinda like if you mixed Civs and SOaSE. Granted, it's no Starcraft, but it should satisfy your hunger for grand scale strategy. This is one of those games that you start at 6am on a Saturday, and shut down your computer at about 9pm on sunday, not even realizing the amount of time you just wasted.If you are still wondering, my suggestion is: BUY IT!!

												Great!Finally another Game of the grand strategy genre from paradox. My old friend - the clausewitz-engine- makes the pardox strategy special. You got a running timeline but can stop everytime to give orders. I love this mechanic. No rounds but no stress like in RTS games.Well there were many strategy titles from paradox that weren´t beginner friendly, but this time the interface and the tutorial are this good that you don´t have to read any manual first. Many things are self explaining but you will discover as many details later in the game.I also like the huge maps. Even with medium size you got a galaxy with no less than 600 systems!Who likes deep and detailed strategy should buy this game! Even for beginners it´s possible to get into the game.Thumbs up!			"

												Stellaris is in a nutshell, one of the most optomized games i have ever seen in recent....ok a long time. At launch i found no problems, the game ran so smooth even on my Potatoe. Combat is just stellar to watch, flashing light, colors, and majestic ships flying about in a dance to the death. Creating your own race to rule the stars, Have a 110 year old Mushroom control the fate of his people. The game is wow, and after looking through the negative reviews, all i see is comparisons to other games. The main comparisons are Crusader kings 2 and Europa Universalis 4, Claiming both games have significantly more deapth. My question to them is, how much depth did either game have at release compared to this game? Stellaris release with so much content and the dev already outlined the major concerns the community has. Depth was added to CK2 and EU4, Stellaris has some depth and will only get more with time.Mostly everyone who reviewed it on its own merits gave it positive reviews. The question comes down to would you recommend this game? If you want to subjegate humans, be annihalated by parrots, or form a alliance consisting only of reptiles and call it the COLD BLOODED COALITION....Then start a COLD WAR....Then don't hesitate to pick up the game. If you don't like 4X or Grand stradegy, probably not the game for you, but i say give it a shot.This game is good and will likely stand on its own for a LOOOOOOOONG Time			"

												I've been a long-time fan of Paradox and their game and was eagerly looking forward to their first game set in space.The early game is fantastic. Early exploration, trying to get the economy going, potentially fighting off (stronger) neighboring empires. And there's nothing like watching your proud fleet being decimated to nothing by a supposedly weaker neighbor, just because you didn't invest in shields against their mighty energy weapons.Now, there's still some bad. As others have noted, the game bogs down after a few hours. Once you have expanded, sectors are the key to keep micro-management to a minimum.However, those have got to be tweaked through patches... as there is still plenty of micro-management going on:  - You can't assign ships to these sectors, so you have to hope that they create their own construction ships. - That means that you need to build up multiple fleets and have to manually patrol them. While you can your fleet to be aggressive and basically attack any enemy station of ship in the same system, it would help if you could also designate a defensive fleet patrolling a sector. - Collecting debris after battles is a nightmare. - Assembling fleets is tedious if you want to spread it out across your empire. It would be better if you could design your fleets and then the various space ports in your empire start producing the required ships as needed and sending them to their rendezvous point.But all of these issues, while annoying, have not kept me from thoroughly enjoying the game. Highly recommended!			"

												The tale of the Raegarian Galactic Republic:There once was a world that reached to the stars with the objective of creating a vast republic of many worlds. For many years this republic grew and flourished, gaining many friends and uniting them all under a single republic using peaceful means. There was no need for weapons of war, and the sole concern for many decades was ensuring there was enough space for the burgeoning gem of the Republic.But the good times came to an end, and the dark times came. Some were not content with the path the Republic was taking, one of peace. They beleived that the Raegarian Republic should become an Empire, after all the Raegarians funded most of the other races projects and defense forces, why shouldn't they be in charge of everything? So they rebelled, the core government powerless to stop them as it had to deal with a temporary energy crisis and had little political capitol to spare to divert the disaster.The rebels quickly took control of vast swaths of the frontier sectors of the Republic, and became increasingly belligerant towards the peaceful inner sectors. So, a decision was made. A new leader elected. A new doctrine adopted.A grand army of the Republic was created, utilizing the extensive scientific knowledge of the Raegarians no expense was spared as the energy crises ended at last, and every planet was expected to assist in the rapid constrtuction of this army. Soon, the Raegarian Republic that once valued peace above all else had a fleet second to none and a clone army meant to occupy countless worlds. A great war broke out with the rebellious sectors, one that lasted for decades. The people hated the thought of warfare, but the risk of letting their belligerant brethern continue ravaging the borders was too great, so slowly the public attitude became increasingly supportive of ending the war through brutal means.Finally, a doctrine of total annihilation was adopted, the ""liberated"" worlds refused to peacefully reintegrate, and entire worlds were glassed to end the threat once and for all for the war began to cost too much in both lives and resources. By the end, the Raegarian republic had become a military dictatorship in order to maintain its efforts, the people disinterested in returning to their peaceful ways, the thought of another unexpected war weighing heavily. The one-time allies began to grow suspicious of the Raegarians, and eventually began abandoning the one-time alliance out of fear the Raegarians had become something dangerous. They were not wrong.The Raegarian Republic eventually separated itself as its military interests were ignored by its remaining allies, and rechristened itself the ""Raegarian Empire"" ironically. Fearful of a multiple front war, the Raegarians blitzed several holdings, forcing their membership into the new empire to buffer its frontier. Soon, only a few holdouts remained, backed by the sole remaining Federation of liberty and freedom. But then they came...From beyond the void, a race of extragalactic creatures invaded the galaxy, striking the Raegarian Empire from behind while the fleets were massing on the border with the Federation. By the time the fleets had responded to contain the threat, many planets had been lost, the Raegarians reeling from the overwhelming numbers. In the first major fleet action, the Raegarians suffered heavy losses and were forced to regroup for the first time since the rebellion wars.Initially, the Federation breathed a sigh of releif, thinking the new threat was their savior. They ignored the Empires frantic pleas for assistance, even with the offer of freeing many of its border worlds. But after years of far away war, costing the Empire many lives and planets just to direct the bloody path of conquest, the war reached the Federation as well. Then they realized the Empire was fighting a foe they could not beat alone, which meant the Federation certainly could not either.A treaty was eventually made as the alien slaughter began decimating the Federation worlds, a return to a form of unity and the two governments threw all they had at the invaders. The war lasted years before the tide began to turn in the natives favor, and the Raegarians finally ended the war when they captured the leader of the alien invaders in a daring assault deep into their territory... where their one-time homeworld was located. The end of the war brought a unsteady peace between the factions, but having seen enough war the galaxy returned to a relative peace looking for threats from outwards instead of inwards, vowing never to be caught off guard and mired by squabbles again.10/10 would play Star Effect again.

												Stellaris is stellar in many ways. Easy to learn, yet difficult to master. Of all stages of the game, I felt that the beginning stage is the stage that is most fun to play, as there are so many things to do at the early part of the game to make sure you snowball into the remainder of the game. That being said, things tend to slow down during the mid game, and you find yourself pausing the game much less.Hats off to Paradox for another great title. I look forward to further content add on and polish, and I would definitely be playing this a lot more in the foreseeable future.			"

												the game is an amazing game and an even better base, the best description I can give of it is it's almost like EUIV, but in Space, which is a really good thing. However I hate to say this and I must but at the time of this review(6/6/2016) the game is really barebones and as much as I hate saying this for games, updates, mods and future DLC will really make this game shine in the long term. However for some may be a bad investment(I know in personal exprience I make below the poverty line so these things are a tough buy for me), so for the more impoverished it may be better to wait for some DLC and get the full pack/GOTY pack/collection in order to cut as much costs and save some precious coin in the long term.

												A solid game from release with promises of continued support in keeping with prior Paradox behaviour.Expect lots of free fleshing out of the game, and plenty of optional DLC to.This is basically the game every sci-fi nerd has been waiting for since they were kids.			"

												I have read several of the negative reviews, and can agree with the content of some of them. Still, I recommend this gave,  if you do not own a 4X space game and want t buy and play one now. The game is weak in the middle period, which Paradox acknowledges and plans to fix in coming updates in June and latter. The diplomacy aspects are also frustrating. There are no intelligence-gathering missions. (Forgot trying to send a science officer to steal another civilization's tecnology.) The random aspects of the tech cards can be infuriating when a particular technology that you want to research is not offered for decades. My suggestion: wait until late June or July to buy (after the 2nd update is released), unless you really want to play a 4x game now.			"

												What to make of Stellaris...I'm only 23 hours into my first campaign but I can tell that Stellaris is going to have my attention for a very long time!The good: Stellaris is gorgeous, fairly intuitive if you're used to the 4x genre, insanely complex and constantly satisfying to play. This is a game that constantly triggers the 'reward' section of my brain with multiple concurrent researching technologies, always busy planets and exploration thats genuinely rewarding. If you get into a 4x so much that you're roleplaying in your head the whole time, Stellaris will make you a very happy player.The bad:Stellaris is, for lack of a better word, awkward when it comes to the user interface. It always feels to me like I have either far too much information on my screen taking up valuable space or not enough. There isn't much of a middle ground. While the gameplay in Stellaris is fairly intuitive, there are times when the user interface was so unintutive that I had to look up what to do online; the most glaring example being the correct buttons to press to finish a war. Another issue I have with Stellaris is the transition between the Stellar and Galactic maps... I loved Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion for a thousand reasons but one of the things I miss in Stellaris that was so simple in Sins is the option to scroll out from the Stellar map to the Galactic map... Its just so intuitive in Sins but in Stellaris you have to go click a button or press a key to transition between the two. Its nit-picking, yes, but its something I missed many times during play already.In closing, Stellaris took me on a journey across the stars that has been full of great unexpected moments of story development, exploration, gorgeous discoveries and so much more. It's worth your time if you like Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion or any of the other space 4x's... Just be ready to switch your thinking back to RTS from turn based!			"

												This game is amazing. If you are a fan of Paradox grand strategy games, then this one is a must for you. Fundamentally this is a 4x game. However, Paradox has done an amazing job of adding their own spin to it. For those that were chased away by previous games like Europa and Crusader Kings 2 due to the difficulty, you will find Stellaris is for you. They have taken the time to provide a great tuatorial which makes the game easy to get into for new players.			"

												the game is an amazing game and an even better base, the best description I can give of it is it's almost like EUIV, but in Space, which is a really good thing. However I hate to say this and I must but at the time of this review(6/6/2016) the game is really barebones and as much as I hate saying this for games, updates, mods and future DLC will really make this game shine in the long term. However for some may be a bad investment(I know in personal exprience I make below the poverty line so these things are a tough buy for me), so for the more impoverished it may be better to wait for some DLC and get the full pack/GOTY pack/collection in order to cut as much costs and save some precious coin in the long term.

												At first, I thought this is just one more generic space strategy game.After spending hours exploring its vast universe and everything it has to offer, I realized I've only scratched the surface. The sun had already come up and I had to get some sleep before trying to find out what else is in store for my empire.Days passed by and I was completely engulfed into the awesome content Stellaris has to offer. I've tried many space games, but this one is by far my favorite.Not only does it have almost infinite possibilities when it comes to customizations, but mechanics are very well thought of, and they only add to this feeling of being in complete control of the galaxy.Yet, be wary. Just when you think you have everything under your control, the game has a few surprises for you! ;)			"

												The tale of the Raegarian Galactic Republic:There once was a world that reached to the stars with the objective of creating a vast republic of many worlds. For many years this republic grew and flourished, gaining many friends and uniting them all under a single republic using peaceful means. There was no need for weapons of war, and the sole concern for many decades was ensuring there was enough space for the burgeoning gem of the Republic.But the good times came to an end, and the dark times came. Some were not content with the path the Republic was taking, one of peace. They beleived that the Raegarian Republic should become an Empire, after all the Raegarians funded most of the other races projects and defense forces, why shouldn't they be in charge of everything? So they rebelled, the core government powerless to stop them as it had to deal with a temporary energy crisis and had little political capitol to spare to divert the disaster.The rebels quickly took control of vast swaths of the frontier sectors of the Republic, and became increasingly belligerant towards the peaceful inner sectors. So, a decision was made. A new leader elected. A new doctrine adopted.A grand army of the Republic was created, utilizing the extensive scientific knowledge of the Raegarians no expense was spared as the energy crises ended at last, and every planet was expected to assist in the rapid constrtuction of this army. Soon, the Raegarian Republic that once valued peace above all else had a fleet second to none and a clone army meant to occupy countless worlds. A great war broke out with the rebellious sectors, one that lasted for decades. The people hated the thought of warfare, but the risk of letting their belligerant brethern continue ravaging the borders was too great, so slowly the public attitude became increasingly supportive of ending the war through brutal means.Finally, a doctrine of total annihilation was adopted, the ""liberated"" worlds refused to peacefully reintegrate, and entire worlds were glassed to end the threat once and for all for the war began to cost too much in both lives and resources. By the end, the Raegarian republic had become a military dictatorship in order to maintain its efforts, the people disinterested in returning to their peaceful ways, the thought of another unexpected war weighing heavily. The one-time allies began to grow suspicious of the Raegarians, and eventually began abandoning the one-time alliance out of fear the Raegarians had become something dangerous. They were not wrong.The Raegarian Republic eventually separated itself as its military interests were ignored by its remaining allies, and rechristened itself the ""Raegarian Empire"" ironically. Fearful of a multiple front war, the Raegarians blitzed several holdings, forcing their membership into the new empire to buffer its frontier. Soon, only a few holdouts remained, backed by the sole remaining Federation of liberty and freedom. But then they came...From beyond the void, a race of extragalactic creatures invaded the galaxy, striking the Raegarian Empire from behind while the fleets were massing on the border with the Federation. By the time the fleets had responded to contain the threat, many planets had been lost, the Raegarians reeling from the overwhelming numbers. In the first major fleet action, the Raegarians suffered heavy losses and were forced to regroup for the first time since the rebellion wars.Initially, the Federation breathed a sigh of releif, thinking the new threat was their savior. They ignored the Empires frantic pleas for assistance, even with the offer of freeing many of its border worlds. But after years of far away war, costing the Empire many lives and planets just to direct the bloody path of conquest, the war reached the Federation as well. Then they realized the Empire was fighting a foe they could not beat alone, which meant the Federation certainly could not either.A treaty was eventually made as the alien slaughter began decimating the Federation worlds, a return to a form of unity and the two governments threw all they had at the invaders. The war lasted years before the tide began to turn in the natives favor, and the Raegarians finally ended the war when they captured the leader of the alien invaders in a daring assault deep into their territory... where their one-time homeworld was located. The end of the war brought a unsteady peace between the factions, but having seen enough war the galaxy returned to a relative peace looking for threats from outwards instead of inwards, vowing never to be caught off guard and mired by squabbles again.10/10 would play Star Effect again.

												I have never so much as touched any grand strategy or 4X games before; these types of games have always intimidated me for one reason or another. Stellaris really allowed me to break into this genre with something that instantly scratches my itch of a love of space exploration, discovery, and galactic interaction. I've been told it's not the deepest 4X ever made, and may have some pacing issues late game, but I for one have been absolutely enamored and as a new 4X player I recommend this for people like me who love the grandness of space.

												Great game. The AI is magnificent because it can surprise you any minute. Whats awesome aswell is the small details on planet and ship designs. The ring world of some fallen empires are a beast idea and mod support is also another good thing.One problem though. I dont know if its a bug for me only or other players too but whenever I start a new game and choose 25 ai civs for example in about mid game i have met nearly double the civs i chose to be there and i am still meeting more evry few years in-game. If more players have experienced this problem then plz fix.Also would like to suggest a custom start option like in civ 5 where you can choose every starting civ yourself and choose recource settings and all other things. Would be awesome to have that. And a bigger tech tree with maybe a new weapons and armour branch locked to all civs until a lot of reasearch has been done. But overall great game and it is still developing so more features and fixes are yet to come.			"

												I recommend this game wholeheartedly. It succeeds where many 4X games have failed. And that is, its not just repetition after repetitions, usually starting or leading up to simple boring micromanagement. It's also, unlike more complex counterparts like say the Galactic Civilization series, very forgiving to new players. Don't get me wrong. It's got a steep learning curve if you wanna be tough enough to face the difficult mode enemies, but I feel like similar to say Civ V, it's not so difficult to get used to. And the customization is astoundedly amazing. It's really the little things that make this game excel beyond expectations.f*** the fallen empires though 0.1/10			"

												After almost 500 logged hours of playtime, i am still finding new and exciting events in almost every playthrough. I am genuinely impressed with the games replayability, Paradox was not joking when they said they would do their best to keep the game enjoyable and intruiging no matter how many times you have played. Buying the expansions is like buying yourself christmas presents in the summer.The End game is done very well with major satisfaction as you sit back and watch your 100k fleet demolish another empire. The End game Chrisese are also well done bringing both immesurable challenge and terror as you watch the Scourge ravage and eat everything that you love and hold dear. I love playing stellaris, and will love playing it for many more hours to come, if your into this kind of game, there are no other games out there that will give you what this game gave me.			"

												Well, I don't know how to put this. The game is really good but feels underdeveloped in some areas. It really lacks depth compared to other games Paradox has done like CK2 and EU4. First few hours are interesting, discovering anomalies, other species and systems. But after few hours you see that game lacks. I feel that there are not much events, but events that are there are very well written, diplomacy lacks unlike EU4 and there are more thinks that feel underdevelped like Ai. It is passive and never attacked me.          But even with all the things the game lacks I can't stop playing it, I have really good time also. The race designer, customizationm, dialogue and that excitment and wonder I felt when playing is awesome in my opinion. There are many more things this game does really good and in my opinion and they overweight the bad ones.           First I didn't know if to recommend or not this game, I would at the momment give it something in the middle. But knowing Paradox I am sure that they will work on this game in months and maybe years to come. More work on the AI, more events and some quality of life improvemts and this game will be superb. And I can't wait to see what will game look like in 12 months time with all the updates and DLC.			"

												I've only played this for about 5 hours. I love the mechanics of 4X games, the grandness and openness, but until now, I've not found a game that really does it justice, with a simple to learn interface and set of systems. I've tried endless space, but that was boring. I've tried Crusader Kings II, but found it too convoluted to even start to begin. But this.. this is perfect so far. The tutorial was good, not too restrictive, so I was able to do other stuff and explore a little bit. Then I restarted and set up my own race (which allows you so many options). Basically, this is my dream game - it's like Twilight Imperium but in a PC game format.			"

												Great game by Paradox that really mixes classic 4X strategy with more forgiving 'Paradox-esque"" traits from Crusader Kings II and Europ Universalis.I've yet to reach a point where nothing is either impossible nor a pushover. No matter how big you grow there's almost always someoone (or multiple) who can put you back into your place if you get greedy. The reverse being true when theres always a way to claw your way back into the game either through diplomacy or shrewd tactics.The ethics system is honestly one of the greatest mechanics in any 4X game I've played to date. Each individual pop will have it's own traits, preferences and ethics that may vary differently from their neighbours. Depending on your actions factions of individualists may rise up to combat your attempts to silence individuality. Or maybe your pacifist citizens are tired of your militaristic ways and decide to stand up for their own beliefs. It's a nice addition as it feels that each race and pop has it's own agenda rather than being another number to pay taxes or join your military.The introduction of a semi-RNG tech system is also an amazing new spin on traditional strategy games. While still partially present in the background linear tech-trees and best practice are things of the past. Sure you maybe be able to rush to Artic colonisation so improving habitatibility now might seem a great idea - and then the card might not appear for 30 years. While I'm sure this might agitate some players it does add the complexity other 4X research lacks. Rather than being commited to unlocking techs one after another they're presented almost as scientific breakthroughs you won't neccesarily expect. In my current playthrough the sudden arrival of a clone army tech was awesome as I had no idea that was even a thing - and in my pacifist, xenophile republic based off of the Star Wars Galactic Republic it was a space geek dream.The combat is simple and may lack some of the mincromanaging skills of other 4X games but lets be honest - it's a Paradox game we never expected that in the first place. Instead it's more about taking th opportunity to strike when it arises - maybe your enemy was drawn into another war or is facing domestic rebellion. Maybe you just unlocked a new tech (hell yeah Advanced Strike Craft) that they have no means to combat. Combat is all about understanding your opponents fleets and building to exploit their flaws while also minimising your own.Of worthy note is the movement system. It's great to see access to wormhole, hyperspace and warp as seperate categories of space travel. It adds more variety to engagement and minimalises the chokehold effect other 4X games may emply. Sure you can build a massive defense station at the chokehold of the hyperspace way - that won't stop warp drives simply bypassing the system. It's nice to force players to think more critically of their decisions and encourage unorthodox gameplay.All in all despite some of the minor issues and lacking capabilities in the game currently it's well worth the price for a game you'll gladly sink hours into. Knowing Paradox the game will recieve support, continual bugfixes and about a million expansions (all of which I'll gladly buy) that will result in one truly amazing game. Give it a shot and make space great again.			"

												For $40, you can own what's probably the best space-based strategy game on the market. Stellaris is full of different possibilities, and with random galactic generation, no two games or the same. In addition to all the great gameplay, Paradox is fully supporting modding and plans to patch/release expansions for several years, so Stellaris is only going to grow. Definitely worth the money now, but wait a few months and it will be a helluva lot better, as a lot of free patches are planned in the next month or two.			"

Just like Crusader Kings or Europa Universallis, I haven't played through one game longer than 4 hours. I get too excited with the prospect of doing something else really cool.

												My main issue with the game is sort of a loss of a core gamplay loop when you arive at what would be considered ""end game"" The initial fun of mapping the stars and surveying planets and that sense of wonder dense with events is sort of lost after a while. Then you have about 20 planets that all have decently working infrastrucutre and the only thing left to do is slowly consume the empires that surround you and reserch more tech. Then a crisis event might happen and that sense of wonder and exitement is rekindled only for you to realise that is basicaly amounts to whack a mole as you must remove what ever cuased the crisis in a long drawn out campagin. Maybe I'm missing the point but i feel like this game needs more content maybe some more ship teirs(big spacships are always cool) and many more mid/lategame events(large factions of space pirates or somthing idk) but untill then only buy it if you're big into crusader kings in space I guess			"

												This is not an action packed game. This is a space empire management game. So before you buy it, know that. You don't control units like Star Craft. Deal with it.I am a very harsh critic of games. Read my other reviews. As of right now there is absolutely no reason to play any other space strategy game. Everything is done right. I honestly am not sure I have a single negative critisism(except for a few release bugs, that will no doubt be corrected). This is a galactic game of chess on steroids. This game has raised the bar and set a new standard on space strategy games. 9.5/10. The only reason this doesn't get a 10 is because of minor bugs. 10 is reserved for perfect games. I have yet to run into one. This is as close as it gets.			"

												Stellaris is a fantastic grand strategy, set in the vast expanse of space.  It is very detailed and takes some time to learn how to play, I restarted a few times just to be doomed to failure early on.  Once you gain a firm grasp of the game's concepts it becomes nearly impossible to stop playing. Starting with a small faction and setting out to create a vast empire, in whatever way you see fit.  In my case I took a small sect of humanity that had gotten lost among the stars, long forgotten by earth, and had them rise up through hardships to conquer the entire galaxy and purge all sentient life that was not human.  This is just one of many ways to play the game, you can choose from one of the many default factions or create your own faction and play your own story, complete with tons of traits and perks to really customize things your way.  The early game is where things really shine. Setting out into the unknown and colonizing new planets, researching new technologies, raising a fleet and armies, establishing contact with new species, going to war and taking other empires for your own, the list goes on and on.  Sadly the late game does not provide you with enough to really keep going, there are some late game crises which are a daunting task to deal with, but other than that it becomes quite slow. In my case it became a chore to wipe all life from the galaxy because I was so powerful and it just became a tedious task, I didn't really feel like I was accomplishing anything.  Despite things ramping down in the late game, Stellaris is still a worthwhile investment if you enjoy strategy games. It also has great mod support for when you get tired of the main game, I turned the whole game into the Star Wars universe from the Old Republic. Definately worth playing.			"

												This game. oh my God this game is amazing!!!!!.It is literally the best 4x space strategy in history and here is why (well atleast in my opinion). So the first thing you will do when starting a new game is picking one of some pre-made races or edit them/create your very own race you get to chose it's appearence ethics and traits aswell as other things about it.Then you get into the gameplay where you start in your home system and from there you will Colonize planets,meet other races,fight fallen empires,dicover the fates and ruins of precursor civilizations upplift/destroy primitive civilizations,research all kinds of sci fi technologies you can imagine and in the end Dominate the Galaxy!!!!. Btw did i mention that this game was made by the creators of europa universalis and crusader kings 2?. Yep Paradox Interactive has done it again also this game has a certain something called console commands.jajajaja i'm not kidding oyu they put those in here FTW and if you're playing the leviathans story pack dlc you will fall in love even quicker btw you can easily get an unreagretable 600 hours into this masterpieceFinal verdict 10/10 Legend			"

												Edit: Much later the game has a few less bugs, but it still comes to a grinding halt due to bad optimization and parallelization. It's practically impossible to finish a game on a big map, because time stops moving even on top pcs.I read in a review that after the early game, the game comes to a grinding halt. This was true gameplay wise. On the 1000 star map after some time, things were barely progressing anymore. This is due to the lack of real diplomacy, sector management, or fleet options. The AI players don't seem like other people at all. They are completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Then the game started moving really, really slowly during each fight, probably due to bad design decisions. I would guess every rocket is modelled in order to hit the right target, in fleets with hundreds of ships. This also explains the lame 1000 fleet max size cap. While modelling every rocket exactly sounds like a fun idea, in the end you don't gain anything from it, but the game becomes very hardware demanding.I still was going to win the game, but now I encountered a game breaking bug. The game freezes for about one second, once per day change... a day change happens about once per second. This was not happening before I exited and reloaded the game, so it is the same situation in game that was working ok before.If you google for this bug, you find lots of threads, some closed by moderators from two months ago, which say that this is already known and about to be fixed. I now also tried to opt into the beta patch in order to try to fix the problem. No improvement.The game wasn't terrible, but game breaking bugs that prevent you from finishing a game aren't ok, even if the game at this state is slowly turning into an annoying grind.			"

												This SPEHS 40KX game is something I can recommend to anyone who likes SPEHS or anything related.It may have some flaws, such as the ability to actually play as aliens, or the possibility of commiting the ultimate heresy of getting faulty ethics such as xenophilia and fraternizing with thr alien scum. But the game makes up for those flaws by enabling you to enslave/genocide/opress all the xeno filth you want (and by Mankind, SHOULD). May God-Emperor smite you if you actually exploit those flaws to play/sympathize with the Alien.May the galaxy tremble before you, my fellow Man.			"

												I was playing Galactic Civilizations II & III before I got Stellaris.Even though I feel that Stellaris lacks several things that make Galactic Civilizations 2 and 3 amazing games, I find myself playing Stellaris far more because of how quickly this game loads up on older hardware and how smoothly it runs on the largest galaxy setting by comparison, that and the introduction of several things I've not seen in space 4x games, like finding primitive civilizations that can advance all the way to the space age and join the rest of the spacefaring races in the galaxy, assuming they survive long enough to advance and achieve interstellar travel. Each civilization in the galaxy can have a variety of society types based on the living conditions and ethics of not just a galactic civilization at large, but on each individual planet as well. There are several species separated into categories, with subcategories for each species type, providing many unique looking creatures to meet.Each game in Stellaris offers a HUGE amount of exploration, which is further enhanced with the numerous mods that range from small graphical changes to the ui, to massive overhauls for the entire game. This is still without all the bells and whistles that the Galactic Civ series has from the start, things like intricate diplomacy and trading. Take my words with a grain of salt. If you really don't want to pay full price right now, sure wait for a sale. Regardless of whatever the choice may be, I recommend this game and say jump right in.  :)			"

												Visually lovely game, good soundtrack, some interesting takes on the space 4X genre... But those aren't the issues with this game.I play a lot of Steam games. I play a lot of Early Access Steam games, too. This game was not listed as Early Access, however the publisher, Paradox, has been pushing game-breaking patches via Steam and invalidating people's save files. Most fans of Paradox cite this as a ""feature"" of Paradox games and they seem to appreciate it - however I'm not in that camp and feel a game should NOT be released on Steam without the Early Access flag unless the game is completely baked. Meaning that the core game rules and features are present in some completed form, even if unbalanced a bit. I'm fine with getting pushed balance and bugfix patches, maybe even a little new content here and there as long as it doesn't break my saves or radically alter the game - but it's clear that the released game was both unfinished and unbaked due to the large amount of completely game-chaning updates which have been pushed by Paradox since release.I want to like this game, but I can't enjoy a game that disrespects my hours of playtime and pulls the rug our from under me every few weeks. If it ever gets near a ""finished"" state, I'd be happy to come back and play it again, because it shows a lot of promise... But a promise without a kiss is just an empty hope.I can't recommend this game in its current form.			"

												I've really tried to enjoy this game, being a big fan of the 4X genre, but there's just not enough interesting decisions to make.  The gameplay systems seem to be designed to limit what you can do and artifically slow down the game.Wait for sales (£10-15) or major improvements.

												I was *very* wary of buying this game. I think a lot of 4X games turn out to be bland, and space 4X games have turned out to be total flops in the past.But I wound up buying it. To be quite honest, the fact that Paradox has acknowledged the game's shortfalls on their forums made me much more comfortable buying it, since it gives me faith that, if I end up with the same criticism as many others have, Paradox will address them.That said, here's my concerns:- The diplomacy system could use more work, compared to EU4 and CK2. However, I do think it meets the standard expectations, and it's significantly better than certain other 4X games, like Civ5 and <insert that crappy 4X space game I can't bother looking up. Samurai space bears come to mind.>.- I've been surprised that alien empires aren't as aggressive as I imagined from a Paradox game, although I suspect that that's by intention - why start galactic wars if there are still colonizable planets? However, if the AI doesn't start to try and kill me at some point, I'll edit this review to say that the game is unplayable.- No orbital mechanics. I realize the engine they've designed is very functional and spartan, and the game looks good for the most part, but damnit, I PLAYED KSP AND I LIKE ORBITAL MECHANICS.- There ought to be a more significant difference between ocean, arctic, and desert worlds. - Minor graphic realism qualms - the galaxy could look more... galaxy-scaled. The background could probably be more realistic. And should the stellar dust be so... dust-looking?- Minor interface qualms.- At this point in my game, I am not convinced that the populations are important enough. It doesn't seem to matter what they believe, and the only racial trait that seems important is their planet preference.- The ship design system could be more rewarding and involved, although it's really not bad. The combat is a bit too rock-paper-scissors, and could use more options.- Some of the tech names/descriptions could be more realistic. What I like about this game: - Unlike many 4X and especially 4X space games, Stellaris seems to have really good pacing and doesn't push too much micromanagement on the player. You generally have something to do, but you don't have to manually control a million planets and constantly organize your fleets - although Paradox should allow us to set planets and fleets as rally points.- It's not turn-based. Trust me, that's a big improvement. - Many of the things you will discover are surprisingly interesting.- Randomized races. I don't have to make them. There's more than the standard few. They're a lot more varied and interesting than I expected. I guess all of this doesn't sound like a huge recommendation, so I'll sum it up:- Stellaris is the best 4X space game since Sword of the Stars 1. It's like all the other ones, but a lot better, as far as I can tell. I'll be sure to update this if I change my mind.			"

												Great game with some flaws. Thankfully Paradox appears to be addressing many of those flaws in the next patch due the end of May and 2 more patches after that. Biggest problem currently is the midgame is dreadfully slow moving. This is due to them releasing without the midgame events that were supposed to happen.So while the game is in a state that I would consider ""unfinished"" it has a solid core and patches in the pipe. Additionally, it is extremely moddable and I expect good things to come due to the mods.If you like Grand Strategy games then this should be in your library.			"

												47 hours into this game, I'm on my 10th restart, and I'm still really enjoying it.  Obviously, with so many restarts I can only speak to the early game but I think it just flows extremely well.  I fought my first war in one of my earlier games and came within an ace of winning.  I didn't quite have the oomph to finish off my neighbor.  This time around I want to crush them hard!  ;)It's 2247.  I've set up three sectors and I'm aiming at a 4th hopefully relatively soon.  My navy is kind of weak with a mix of half and half destroyers and corvettes.  It's about 1k in strength.  I'm researching cruisers right now but they're still several years away.I'm right next door to a BIG neighbor that I'm playing nice with so he'll ignore me for the time being.  He's busy beating up on a bunch of weak sisters to our galactic east.  Meanwhile, I'm plotting his eventual demise in the distant future...Did I mention that I love the roleplaying in this game?Oh, yeah, definitely worth buying!			"

												Is stellaris perfect? Nope. Is it a great space grand strategy experince? Hell yes.What does it do that I have never seen before? - The Race system. This is both the construction of your race, the intereactions with others, and how all of this intertwines itself with ethics, politics, and governemnt of your empire. - The event system. This is mostly into early and mid game but exploring the galaxy is really fun. I think it makes having a more empty map even more fun than a heavily populated one.- The battle system - for a grand strategy I find the battle system a good compromise. IT is not too abstracted that it is boring but you have minimal actual tactical control. I do feel like it gives you useful information and you have a direct investment in yours hip designs. This is fun.- The tech tree. The way the tech tree is done it is not overwhelming, and this is really nice. You randomly get 3 choices for each of 3 technology typse so you never know what you will research this time.			"

												This game was a sleeper hit for me, I didn't know much about it until I began to watch previews on You Tube and it immediately interested me. Now before I gush, there are bugs here and there and some really epic AI flaws that need to be fixed- but I haven't been roped into a single player game in easily half a year.Stellaris pulled me in and kept me in, I really love this game, the scope is truly grand, the customization is amazing and the potential for this to grow and be modded is very exciting. For me this game is like Civilization in space crossed with Sins of a Solar Empire but with much more detail to many more aspects.If you love RTS/Empire building and grand strategy this game is a MUST HAVE. For science fiction lovers I would also recommend this if you enjoy any kind of RTS.All in all I give this game a 8.5/10 and no doubt when the AI is patched up and more content is added it would easily score a 9.5 in my books!Update:I have begun playing with mods, AI mods, extra race mods, ship clipping/overlapping reduction mods and more that bring extra life and a more living feel to the universe. If you are a fan of modding and space games look no further at this point. :)See you space cowboy...			"

												I am a huge fan of RTS games. I love many types of strategy games. Of all the Strategy games I habe played I would put this in the top of my list for sure. I have only been able to log in 52 hours into the game, yet I still have only scratched the surface. This game to me is a great blend of two of my favorite Strategy games. Total War and Civ. I like how the economy is set up in the game. I think it has a good balance. What I mean by good balance is that it is not incredibly easy to have a surplus of materials, while in the same sense it is not terribly hard either. By adding the rare materials that give you a great boost in your economy was a good idea. It also adds a reason to fight over certain solar systems as well. It keeps you from just sitting back and racking up resources until late game. The amount of content the game has is really compelling as well. There are tons of different technologies you can learn to better you planets, you defenses, your military, etc. Also there are a ton of different races and traits to choose from. The ability to customize your own civilization is fantastic. The traits keep you balanced as well. By not allowing you to do certain things within your own goverment makes it a little more difficult when conquering other civs.Those are a few of the reasons I think this is a great game. The only con that I personally would like to be changed is the combat. I dont feel too involved in the combat. It doesnt capture my attention. I like to be more involved in my battles like I am in Total War. I do understand not every game and its combat will be like Total War and that is fine. I would just like to be a little more involved then just click a whole fleet and watching them fight a different fleet. Maybe that could be supplemented by adding the ability to control the armies that invade planets. Overall I think this game was worth every penny and any fan of RTS/Strategy games should play this. It is alot of fun.			"

I have read several of the negative reviews on this game so far. i just want it to be known that some of those reviews are for the hardest core 4x gamers (which i am). im not saying they are wrong but this game just came out. The amount of content in this game for a vanilla version is more then most games at this stage of release. Also the game is on steam workshop now and the mods are starting to flow.For a paradox game, the learning curve is simpler then most when compared to their other titles. still a challenge enough to be a true paradox game. overall, very fun game, worth the price i payed. totally :)			"

												OK so I have roughly about 15 hours into this game and here's what I would consider an honest review.I should also mention that ive not played any other paradox games, so I think IM coming into this game with a fresh perspective2 of those hours are spent in creating my race ( still waiting on a star wars mod haha)I found the initial start of the game a tiny bit confusing, but the tutorial quickly gets rid of any confusion.After that it is a classic management game set in an amazing sci fi universe. So once I figured out what I was doing an all the menus , I quickly set out to take over a small universe (150 stars) .. As I said im new to this game I went with a standard race type and started settling the new words slowly but surely. Had a good mineral store and energy credit store, also had what I thought was a good size fleet ( I was wrong) .. After a few hours of gameplay and meeting a cpl of other races. I decided to tackle a battle ........ Suffice to say I was rick rolled on my first battle .. I was at war ..... They came after my systems and went through them like butter LOL ..... I didn't mind this as was fun to watch after all this I sat back reviewed what had happened .... I started a new game and went a bit more slowly LOL so 10/10 for awesome gamplay .. Sounds effects .. And pretty much everything !!The only con I have is ... I wish the tutorials for later game mechanics were a little bit more in depth .. But anyone with a working 4k game knowledge will get through this Definitely recommend this game .... Someone please hurry up with a star wars mod please !!			"

												I was *very* wary of buying this game. I think a lot of 4X games turn out to be bland, and space 4X games have turned out to be total flops in the past.But I wound up buying it. To be quite honest, the fact that Paradox has acknowledged the game's shortfalls on their forums made me much more comfortable buying it, since it gives me faith that, if I end up with the same criticism as many others have, Paradox will address them.That said, here's my concerns:- The diplomacy system could use more work, compared to EU4 and CK2. However, I do think it meets the standard expectations, and it's significantly better than certain other 4X games, like Civ5 and <insert that crappy 4X space game I can't bother looking up. Samurai space bears come to mind.>.- I've been surprised that alien empires aren't as aggressive as I imagined from a Paradox game, although I suspect that that's by intention - why start galactic wars if there are still colonizable planets? However, if the AI doesn't start to try and kill me at some point, I'll edit this review to say that the game is unplayable.- No orbital mechanics. I realize the engine they've designed is very functional and spartan, and the game looks good for the most part, but damnit, I PLAYED KSP AND I LIKE ORBITAL MECHANICS.- There ought to be a more significant difference between ocean, arctic, and desert worlds. - Minor graphic realism qualms - the galaxy could look more... galaxy-scaled. The background could probably be more realistic. And should the stellar dust be so... dust-looking?- Minor interface qualms.- At this point in my game, I am not convinced that the populations are important enough. It doesn't seem to matter what they believe, and the only racial trait that seems important is their planet preference.- The ship design system could be more rewarding and involved, although it's really not bad. The combat is a bit too rock-paper-scissors, and could use more options.- Some of the tech names/descriptions could be more realistic. What I like about this game: - Unlike many 4X and especially 4X space games, Stellaris seems to have really good pacing and doesn't push too much micromanagement on the player. You generally have something to do, but you don't have to manually control a million planets and constantly organize your fleets - although Paradox should allow us to set planets and fleets as rally points.- It's not turn-based. Trust me, that's a big improvement. - Many of the things you will discover are surprisingly interesting.- Randomized races. I don't have to make them. There's more than the standard few. They're a lot more varied and interesting than I expected. I guess all of this doesn't sound like a huge recommendation, so I'll sum it up:- Stellaris is the best 4X space game since Sword of the Stars 1. It's like all the other ones, but a lot better, as far as I can tell. I'll be sure to update this if I change my mind.			"

												Great game with some flaws. Thankfully Paradox appears to be addressing many of those flaws in the next patch due the end of May and 2 more patches after that. Biggest problem currently is the midgame is dreadfully slow moving. This is due to them releasing without the midgame events that were supposed to happen.So while the game is in a state that I would consider ""unfinished"" it has a solid core and patches in the pipe. Additionally, it is extremely moddable and I expect good things to come due to the mods.If you like Grand Strategy games then this should be in your library.			"

												47 hours into this game, I'm on my 10th restart, and I'm still really enjoying it.  Obviously, with so many restarts I can only speak to the early game but I think it just flows extremely well.  I fought my first war in one of my earlier games and came within an ace of winning.  I didn't quite have the oomph to finish off my neighbor.  This time around I want to crush them hard!  ;)It's 2247.  I've set up three sectors and I'm aiming at a 4th hopefully relatively soon.  My navy is kind of weak with a mix of half and half destroyers and corvettes.  It's about 1k in strength.  I'm researching cruisers right now but they're still several years away.I'm right next door to a BIG neighbor that I'm playing nice with so he'll ignore me for the time being.  He's busy beating up on a bunch of weak sisters to our galactic east.  Meanwhile, I'm plotting his eventual demise in the distant future...Did I mention that I love the roleplaying in this game?Oh, yeah, definitely worth buying!			"

												Is stellaris perfect? Nope. Is it a great space grand strategy experince? Hell yes.What does it do that I have never seen before? - The Race system. This is both the construction of your race, the intereactions with others, and how all of this intertwines itself with ethics, politics, and governemnt of your empire. - The event system. This is mostly into early and mid game but exploring the galaxy is really fun. I think it makes having a more empty map even more fun than a heavily populated one.- The battle system - for a grand strategy I find the battle system a good compromise. IT is not too abstracted that it is boring but you have minimal actual tactical control. I do feel like it gives you useful information and you have a direct investment in yours hip designs. This is fun.- The tech tree. The way the tech tree is done it is not overwhelming, and this is really nice. You randomly get 3 choices for each of 3 technology typse so you never know what you will research this time.			"

												This game was a sleeper hit for me, I didn't know much about it until I began to watch previews on You Tube and it immediately interested me. Now before I gush, there are bugs here and there and some really epic AI flaws that need to be fixed- but I haven't been roped into a single player game in easily half a year.Stellaris pulled me in and kept me in, I really love this game, the scope is truly grand, the customization is amazing and the potential for this to grow and be modded is very exciting. For me this game is like Civilization in space crossed with Sins of a Solar Empire but with much more detail to many more aspects.If you love RTS/Empire building and grand strategy this game is a MUST HAVE. For science fiction lovers I would also recommend this if you enjoy any kind of RTS.All in all I give this game a 8.5/10 and no doubt when the AI is patched up and more content is added it would easily score a 9.5 in my books!Update:I have begun playing with mods, AI mods, extra race mods, ship clipping/overlapping reduction mods and more that bring extra life and a more living feel to the universe. If you are a fan of modding and space games look no further at this point. :)See you space cowboy...			"

												I am a huge fan of RTS games. I love many types of strategy games. Of all the Strategy games I habe played I would put this in the top of my list for sure. I have only been able to log in 52 hours into the game, yet I still have only scratched the surface. This game to me is a great blend of two of my favorite Strategy games. Total War and Civ. I like how the economy is set up in the game. I think it has a good balance. What I mean by good balance is that it is not incredibly easy to have a surplus of materials, while in the same sense it is not terribly hard either. By adding the rare materials that give you a great boost in your economy was a good idea. It also adds a reason to fight over certain solar systems as well. It keeps you from just sitting back and racking up resources until late game. The amount of content the game has is really compelling as well. There are tons of different technologies you can learn to better you planets, you defenses, your military, etc. Also there are a ton of different races and traits to choose from. The ability to customize your own civilization is fantastic. The traits keep you balanced as well. By not allowing you to do certain things within your own goverment makes it a little more difficult when conquering other civs.Those are a few of the reasons I think this is a great game. The only con that I personally would like to be changed is the combat. I dont feel too involved in the combat. It doesnt capture my attention. I like to be more involved in my battles like I am in Total War. I do understand not every game and its combat will be like Total War and that is fine. I would just like to be a little more involved then just click a whole fleet and watching them fight a different fleet. Maybe that could be supplemented by adding the ability to control the armies that invade planets. Overall I think this game was worth every penny and any fan of RTS/Strategy games should play this. It is alot of fun.			"

												first off, I love this game enough to go out of my way to write a review. I have read several of the negative reviews on this game so far. i just want it to be known that some of those reviews are for the hardest core 4x gamers (which i am). im not saying they are wrong but this game just came out. The amount of content in this game for a vanilla version is more then most games at this stage of release. Also the game is on steam workshop now and the mods are starting to flow.For a paradox game, the learning curve is simpler then most when compared to their other titles. still a challenge enough to be a true paradox game. overall, very fun game, worth the price i payed. totally :)			"

Very well done.Update after nearly 100hours:This is by far one of the best games I have ever played. Serioulsy this is very addictive and delivers the best space exploration and space empire or United Federation of Planets experience a game offered to me.Plus the developers do a very good job keeping it getting even more interesting.Buy this game !!

												In short, stellaris is cool. But you can tell about 2 hours in that its going to be one of those Paradox games where they release the game with little content that you imagine the game would have. and 2 years and $200 worth of DLC later your game is completeStellaris has some good parts and some bad parts just like any game, but its the missing parts that leave me the most confused. No rebellions or factions. no mapmodes (???). little diplomacy for a 4x. perhaps the worst Paradox ai i have ever seen. they dont even attack me so far and im in like 2300. tl,dr Buy only if you have spare money and time for a DLC project game like ck2			"

												So let me start off by saying this game is almost awesome.  I have loved playing it so much....in the beginning.  The problem is when your star system starts to get very large the game slows down to unbearable levels.  It is almost unplayable at this point.  They do have a beta patch that seems to help a little at first.  If you shut down the game and start it back up every so often it seems to run a bit smoother....but not enough.  So in the future hopefully I will change my review, because the thumbs down is based solely on the latency issues.			"

												A good start for a 4x-space game franchise. The midgame is pretty bad though, which is surprising considering the strengths of the Clausewitz engine as exemplified in EUIV for instance. The problem is that it doesn't transition well from early to mid game, and mid game takes time to develop. Even when it is developed the weaknesses in current Diplomacy is hard to ignore which makes you lose interest.I might seem harsh, but looking at the other games in the market Stellaris still has a bit to go. Right now I still consider Endless Space the best 4x-space game is Endless Space. But there is a future for Stellaris as Paradox are known for the quality and improvements they put into their games post release and with their DLC. Therefore I think this game might be really good in a year or two. But until then, I recommend staying with Endless Space.			"

												Too often find myself getting attacked by fleets 5x my size at the beginning of the game and having to restart, even after learning how to play a lot better. Poor guidance on how to cross galactic spiral arms. I'm fine with a high learning curve, but this game legitimately doesn't give guidance where it's needed. Early game is too hard, late game is too easy, and it's almost never effective to run around with multiple fleets so war strategy against equal opponents gets reduced to amassing and attacking singular points.

												Great game by Paradox that really mixes classic 4X strategy with more forgiving 'Paradox-esque"" traits from Crusader Kings II and Europ Universalis.I've yet to reach a point where nothing is either impossible nor a pushover. No matter how big you grow there's almost always someoone (or multiple) who can put you back into your place if you get greedy. The reverse being true when theres always a way to claw your way back into the game either through diplomacy or shrewd tactics.The ethics system is honestly one of the greatest mechanics in any 4X game I've played to date. Each individual pop will have it's own traits, preferences and ethics that may vary differently from their neighbours. Depending on your actions factions of individualists may rise up to combat your attempts to silence individuality. Or maybe your pacifist citizens are tired of your militaristic ways and decide to stand up for their own beliefs. It's a nice addition as it feels that each race and pop has it's own agenda rather than being another number to pay taxes or join your military.The introduction of a semi-RNG tech system is also an amazing new spin on traditional strategy games. While still partially present in the background linear tech-trees and best practice are things of the past. Sure you maybe be able to rush to Artic colonisation so improving habitatibility now might seem a great idea - and then the card might not appear for 30 years. While I'm sure this might agitate some players it does add the complexity other 4X research lacks. Rather than being commited to unlocking techs one after another they're presented almost as scientific breakthroughs you won't neccesarily expect. In my current playthrough the sudden arrival of a clone army tech was awesome as I had no idea that was even a thing - and in my pacifist, xenophile republic based off of the Star Wars Galactic Republic it was a space geek dream.The combat is simple and may lack some of the mincromanaging skills of other 4X games but lets be honest - it's a Paradox game we never expected that in the first place. Instead it's more about taking th opportunity to strike when it arises - maybe your enemy was drawn into another war or is facing domestic rebellion. Maybe you just unlocked a new tech (hell yeah Advanced Strike Craft) that they have no means to combat. Combat is all about understanding your opponents fleets and building to exploit their flaws while also minimising your own.Of worthy note is the movement system. It's great to see access to wormhole, hyperspace and warp as seperate categories of space travel. It adds more variety to engagement and minimalises the chokehold effect other 4X games may emply. Sure you can build a massive defense station at the chokehold of the hyperspace way - that won't stop warp drives simply bypassing the system. It's nice to force players to think more critically of their decisions and encourage unorthodox gameplay.All in all despite some of the minor issues and lacking capabilities in the game currently it's well worth the price for a game you'll gladly sink hours into. Knowing Paradox the game will recieve support, continual bugfixes and about a million expansions (all of which I'll gladly buy) that will result in one truly amazing game. Give it a shot and make space great again.			"

												Paradox hit it out of the park, yet again. For such a deep and complex system, that is signature with Paradox games, I walk away every time I play the game feeling not only satisfied, but full of ideas for what I want to do next. Just like Crusader Kings or Europa Universallis, I haven't played through one game longer than 4 hours. I get too excited with the prospect of doing something else really cool. Empire creation, even in its vanilla stage, is really fun to get into. Bottom line, if you're into deep, real-time strategy games, this game is an essential.			"

I love the mechanics of 4X games, the grandness and openness, but until now, I've not found a game that really does it justice, with a simple to learn interface and set of systems. I've tried endless space, but that was boring. I've tried Crusader Kings II, but found it too convoluted to even start to begin. But this.. this is perfect so far. The tutorial was good, not too restrictive, so I was able to do other stuff and explore a little bit. Then I restarted and set up my own race (which allows you so many options). Basically, this is my dream game - it's like Twilight Imperium but in a PC game format.			"

												I was playing Galactic Civilizations II & III before I got Stellaris.Even though I feel that Stellaris lacks several things that make Galactic Civilizations 2 and 3 amazing games, I find myself playing Stellaris far more because of how quickly this game loads up on older hardware and how smoothly it runs on the largest galaxy setting by comparison, that and the introduction of several things I've not seen in space 4x games, like finding primitive civilizations that can advance all the way to the space age and join the rest of the spacefaring races in the galaxy, assuming they survive long enough to advance and achieve interstellar travel. Each civilization in the galaxy can have a variety of society types based on the living conditions and ethics of not just a galactic civilization at large, but on each individual planet as well. There are several species separated into categories, with subcategories for each species type, providing many unique looking creatures to meet.Each game in Stellaris offers a HUGE amount of exploration, which is further enhanced with the numerous mods that range from small graphical changes to the ui, to massive overhauls for the entire game. This is still without all the bells and whistles that the Galactic Civ series has from the start, things like intricate diplomacy and trading. Take my words with a grain of salt. If you really don't want to pay full price right now, sure wait for a sale. Regardless of whatever the choice may be, I recommend this game and say jump right in.  :)			"

												Edit: Much later the game has a few less bugs, but it still comes to a grinding halt due to bad optimization and parallelization. It's practically impossible to finish a game on a big map, because time stops moving even on top pcs.I read in a review that after the early game, the game comes to a grinding halt. This was true gameplay wise. On the 1000 star map after some time, things were barely progressing anymore. This is due to the lack of real diplomacy, sector management, or fleet options. The AI players don't seem like other people at all. They are completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Then the game started moving really, really slowly during each fight, probably due to bad design decisions. I would guess every rocket is modelled in order to hit the right target, in fleets with hundreds of ships. This also explains the lame 1000 fleet max size cap. While modelling every rocket exactly sounds like a fun idea, in the end you don't gain anything from it, but the game becomes very hardware demanding.I still was going to win the game, but now I encountered a game breaking bug. The game freezes for about one second, once per day change... a day change happens about once per second. This was not happening before I exited and reloaded the game, so it is the same situation in game that was working ok before.If you google for this bug, you find lots of threads, some closed by moderators from two months ago, which say that this is already known and about to be fixed. I now also tried to opt into the beta patch in order to try to fix the problem. No improvement.The game wasn't terrible, but game breaking bugs that prevent you from finishing a game aren't ok, even if the game at this state is slowly turning into an annoying grind.			"

												Too often find myself getting attacked by fleets 5x my size at the beginning of the game and having to restart, even after learning how to play a lot better. Poor guidance on how to cross galactic spiral arms. I'm fine with a high learning curve, but this game legitimately doesn't give guidance where it's needed. Early game is too hard, late game is too easy, and it's almost never effective to run around with multiple fleets so war strategy against equal opponents gets reduced to amassing and attacking singular points.

												This game was a sleeper hit for me, I didn't know much about it until I began to watch previews on You Tube and it immediately interested me. Now before I gush, there are bugs here and there and some really epic AI flaws that need to be fixed- but I haven't been roped into a single player game in easily half a year.Stellaris pulled me in and kept me in, I really love this game, the scope is truly grand, the customization is amazing and the potential for this to grow and be modded is very exciting. For me this game is like Civilization in space crossed with Sins of a Solar Empire but with much more detail to many more aspects.If you love RTS/Empire building and grand strategy this game is a MUST HAVE. For science fiction lovers I would also recommend this if you enjoy any kind of RTS.All in all I give this game a 8.5/10 and no doubt when the AI is patched up and more content is added it would easily score a 9.5 in my books!Update:I have begun playing with mods, AI mods, extra race mods, ship clipping/overlapping reduction mods and more that bring extra life and a more living feel to the universe. If you are a fan of modding and space games look no further at this point. :)See you space cowboy...			"

												first off, I love this game enough to go out of my way to write a review. I have read several of the negative reviews on this game so far. i just want it to be known that some of those reviews are for the hardest core 4x gamers (which i am). im not saying they are wrong but this game just came out. The amount of content in this game for a vanilla version is more then most games at this stage of release. Also the game is on steam workshop now and the mods are starting to flow.For a paradox game, the learning curve is simpler then most when compared to their other titles. still a challenge enough to be a true paradox game. overall, very fun game, worth the price i payed. totally :)			"

												Truly one of the best games espec. in the 4x genre I have played for a very long time.Not my desired worthy Master of Orion 2 clone but another approach to the 4x genre.For me it has the look and feel of a kind of a Star Trek game - like a ""Birth of the Federation"" with all the space exploration and colonization. Very well done.Update after nearly 100hours:This is by far one of the best games I have ever played. Serioulsy this is very addictive and delivers the best space exploration and space empire or United Federation of Planets experience a game offered to me.Plus the developers do a very good job keeping it getting even more interesting.Buy this game !! You won't regret it.			"

												So let me start off by saying this game is almost awesome.  I have loved playing it so much....in the beginning.  The problem is when your star system starts to get very large the game slows down to unbearable levels.  It is almost unplayable at this point.  They do have a beta patch that seems to help a little at first.  If you shut down the game and start it back up every so often it seems to run a bit smoother....but not enough.  So in the future hopefully I will change my review, because the thumbs down is based solely on the latency issues.			"

												Visually lovely game, good soundtrack, some interesting takes on the space 4X genre... But those aren't the issues with this game.I play a lot of Steam games. I play a lot of Early Access Steam games, too. This game was not listed as Early Access, however the publisher, Paradox, has been pushing game-breaking patches via Steam and invalidating people's save files. Most fans of Paradox cite this as a ""feature"" of Paradox games and they seem to appreciate it - however I'm not in that camp and feel a game should NOT be released on Steam without the Early Access flag unless the game is completely baked. Meaning that the core game rules and features are present in some completed form, even if unbalanced a bit. I'm fine with getting pushed balance and bugfix patches, maybe even a little new content here and there as long as it doesn't break my saves or radically alter the game - but it's clear that the released game was both unfinished and unbaked due to the large amount of completely game-chaning updates which have been pushed by Paradox since release.I want to like this game, but I can't enjoy a game that disrespects my hours of playtime and pulls the rug our from under me every few weeks. If it ever gets near a ""finished"" state, I'd be happy to come back and play it again, because it shows a lot of promise... But a promise without a kiss is just an empty hope.I can't recommend this game in its current form.			"

												The early game exploration + expansion is decent, though has a lot of room for improvement. The mid game is a grind that slows down more and more as the game drags on. Actually capturing enemy planets or making another empire a vassal takes a very long time. Why? Because often you will declare war with an empire who has allies and end up having to defeat ~30% of 5 empires just to be rewarded with 2 planets... in a galaxy with a few thousand planets. There is no other victory condition other than combat that I'm aware of either. The UI is less than mediocre  and is apparently going to be a main focus of the first patch due out at the end of May. There are no waypoints for shipyards, which is something pretty basic, and some midgame tasks are made incredibly tedious by the lack of UI elements such as ""show me planets in my borders with untapped resources"" or earlygame things such as ""show me a list of all habitable planets."" In general having sortable lists is a good thing and there's not much of that here yet. There is potential here. The general slow-paced RTS with large scope idea works, but it's just really rough right now and 90% of the fun is in the first few hours of the game. This might be a very good game in a year's time, but in its current state I'd recommend waiting for the sales.			"

												Buggy and incomplete.Update 8/2016The game has been out for a few months now and the Paradox team have put out a number of updates to the game. It's great to see them still supporting the game, but unfortuantely it's still a buggy mess. In my opinion, the game is unplayable. The most offending bug to me currently is the fleet ai. Every once in a while your fleet will bug out when it engages an enemy. Most of your fleet will stand still while a single ship or two wanders forward to die a few at a time. This causes you to lose the fight, even if it's your 5k fleet against a civilian mining station. When this happens, you are forced to retreat your fleet which now causes them to be lost in space for a few months before returning bruised and broken. Instead of fixing gamebreaking bugs like this, they release new cosmetic DLC for ships that look like plants.Please Paradox, PLAY YOUR GAME and fix things so that they're playable.			"

												Firstly, this is my first Paradox game so I cannot compare to previous games from the developer.However, the 40 or so hours I've spent on the game so far has been in one game. I started as the ""Solarian Star Republic"" which was a militaristic, xenophilic human government with a personal mandate to have the most powerful fleet in the galaxy. After a few pre-emptive strikes on a former ally (I swear they were going to attack me!), they'd been absorbed and I sat as the 10th largest in terms of volume of space, while my military was 3rd in the galaxy. Not only that but I'd formed a Federation which was the most powerful alliance of star nations in the galaxy. Following that, there was a bit of friction with a fallen empire and I, again, pre-emtpively struck them with a force three times more powerful than anything they had (plust the allies who decided to help out). After absorbing the fallen empire after the shortest war in the history of the galaxy, I looked over my new domain of space and began aggressive colonisation of my newly found paradise. Finally having a chance to breathe, I looked over the Solarian League (I renamed it) and realised that, although I'd acted in terms of non-expansionist policy (I'd aimed to destroy my threat, not expand my territory), not ONCE had I been on the defencive. Now, my empire was the 2nd largest by volume and, by far, the most powerful military and, I'm guessing, the most powerful economy (thank you Fallen Empire).If you couldn't be bothered to read all that, I'll summarise my point quickly. This game lets you play how you want, at whatever speed you want, for as long as you want. There aren't many games that do THAT right.I just wish they'd release the damn soundtrack!!!			"

												This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to write a review, so apologies in advance if I ramble.Firstly, let me say that Stellaris is a *wonderful* game with scads of potential. But if you're buying Stellaris expecting “EU4-In-Spaaaaaace”, then I would advise caution. Stellaris is its own game. Not simply a re-skin. There are some recognizable UI elements and Paradox Grand Strategy tropes, but that's it. Many things are handled differently: resources, vassals, armies (in both creation and customization), and research - just to name a few. However, as I mentioned above, the operative word is potential. It’s not there yet. Stellaris has a long way to go before it’s on the same level as EU4 or CK2. I don't mean in terms of story or setting, I mean in terms of gameplay and UI.There is a surprising lack of map modes for a Grand Strategy game. Not having a way to easily see who’s allied to whom, or who you are sucking up to, is particularly missed. The trade map mode is missing as well, but then again, so is trade. In this way Stellaris reminds me more of Civilization. No managing trade nodes. No way to steer trade or use your mercantile strength in your favor, it simply happens via trade deals with other empires. No sneaky-sneaking either. Intrigue is non-existent against other space faring races (though you can infiltrate pre-space age peoples and supplant their government with your own).Those are just some of the issues I’ve run across in 20-or-so hours. Now, I have no doubt that Paradox will positively inundate Stellaris with DLC content to flesh it out. But that's the rub. If you’ve ever played a Sims game at launch you’ll know the feeling. ""You gave me pools last time EA... where are they now? Seriously? Five lamps and a wall sconce?"" Except here I was asking for deeper trade, easier ways to access information, more options to flex my diplomatic muscles, a more succinct and intuitive UI - in short, a greater range of ways to conquer the galaxy. I know you can do it Paradox! You've done it before! Doesn’t paint a pretty picture does it? So why would I recommend Stellaris? Because even with its flaws. It's good. Really good. And it will only get better. There are too many positives to list. There’s creativity here; quality too. This wasn’t half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it needs some polish. That shouldn't be a big surprise really. This is a big departure from what Paradox normally puts out, Stellaris needs time to acclimate, room to figure out what works and what doesn't. If Paradox’s track record is any indication – it will get there in time. Just temper your expectations for now.  "

												So this is mostly just a refute of almost all of the negative comments. Yes the vanilla game gets tedious after one or two playthroughs. Yes some elements such as the tech tree seem annoying cause you cant plan out how to get which techs EXACTLY when you want it. (boohoo civ players, experiment a little) But Stellaris is made to be the GREAT GAME THAT IT IS because of the mods most of the negative comments admit to ignoring. I've owned the game for 3-4 months now, and I have seen 5 incredibly game changing mods come out that I use, and numerous others that I dont but wish I did. That is what makes this game unique, the fact you can customize your gameplay experince on the terms of another players mod.			"

												It's quite expensive game similar to the Sins of Solar Empire but with less action...It has nice music and graphics and the ships customisation is really nice (together with since discoveries). The game will be - most likely - extended in the future with even more expensive addons and it will become more interesting I guess.At the current state it lacks of episionage and trade. Much advertised exploration is getting bored after a while.. all you need to do is to keep sending your exploration ships from system to system and do the surveys. Interaction with other races is boring as well. AI is pretty bad.Personal one - can't run Enlightened Monarchy with ""Individuals"" race... available for ""pacifists"" only :) "

												This review will only touch on the game breaking performance issues and the bugs.  Everything runs smooth on an Intel i7, GT 750, 16GB, and an SSD, UNTIL mid to late game.  Then there is just stuttering everywhere, its impossible to really do anything.  Add that on top of the fact that the AI for your own navy is just terrible.  Don't let your ships get ""stuck"" between two enemies.  It doesn't know what to do, gets confused, and just sits there.  You can't do anything but retreat which takes a bunch of hitpoints away from your overall health (hull).  Its terrible in the current state.  Hoping that they fix the issues, because the early game is extremely fun.  However the game was rushed without testing to make a buck, very disappointing.			"

												Impressive. First word that comes to mind when I think of this game. The reason that made me write this review is that I've played quite a few games that are like this or at least in its general ball park and the one thing that I have always had an issue with is difficulty. It usually is to hard or to easy and I have always had to handicap myself to have a solid challenge. I have create 2 races and gave them what I would consider to be a moderate advantage (better research and army strength bonues). With both of these races I got to the point in the game where I was established had more money then I really needed as well as energy and had a very sizeable army. At this point I decided it was time to take over the galaxy. This is when the game actually surprised me. With my first race I started looking at other races and found it saying they had the same army strength as me...which I laughed at. After my first race was destroyed cause of my arrogance I thought it was a fluke. This prompted me to make my second race with a bigger research bonus and army strength.This time I planned, formulated, and devised my plans for attack, made friends, and waited for the right time to attack. When that came I launched everything I had at my enemies. It was so easy to kill everything. I was sacking planets, killing orbiting platforms, and picking off science vessals and the like. I though victory was secured...that was into an enemy fleet jumped in that was twice my size...I had been wondering why I hand't fought any army yet...and to my horror I realized they had been building up in order to actually take me out. By the time I realized this it was to late and my second race was already on the path to destruction.Just this makes me recommend this game and that isnt even mentioning the other wonderful aspects of this game. Though I would get a few mods to increase like flag choices and some other cosmetic issues. Also I would like to note that my races didn't fail cause the game was to hard or to easy but because i underestimated its potential and underestimated my enemy. Any game that can allow that kind of event to happen will always get my recommendation.			"

												This is my third attempt to post a review of Stellaris.  The first two disappeared.  Hopefully this one will get posted.I really wanted to like this game.  The early parts of the game seemed promising.  The exploration and early expansion phases were enjoyable.  Searching the stars to see what special events/objects were hiding there gave a sense of exploration and momentum to the game.From there, however, things ground down to a stagnant experience.  The first problem was simply bugs.  I would discover artifacts from the ""First League"", once I find 6 of them, I can find the honeworld.  Well, problem was you would find about 4 to 5 and then nothing, even after exploring the entire universe, the last items would not show up.  A later patch tried to address that by respawning anomoly locations in your explored space to make the missing items available.  Tht was better but I found that the icon indicating the presence of an anomoly would not stay displayed reliably.  Even them once I found all 6 items and was directed to the homworld, there was nothing there.  Just .... nothing.Asides from bugs like this (that still seem to be present as of 2 days ago) the game dynamics seem to inevitably lead to a stagnant game.  The diplomacy system is to weak as it allows the creation of defensive packs and alliances to guard against attacks, but nothing to allow one to incite others to declare war together.  Federations are simply a dead weight on ones neck as more often than not, the fellow members will reject proposals for war.  And there is no way to strike a deal with someone to break an alliance.  The end result is that the ensuing tangle of pacts make war next to impossible.  Given that the only victory conditions for the game are conquest-based, that makes for an annoying game experience.Even the war mechanisms are flawed.  One can only force an enemy to accept defeat by accumulating ""war score"".  The problem is that ""war score"" is based on how many enemy units on destrys and enemy planets are occupired.  if the enemy is too small, one can completely destroy every unit they have and occupy every planet they have and yet still not be able to force them to accept defeat because it did not generate sufficient ""war score"" and with no more planets to occupy or units to destroy, one cannot get any more war score.In short, I think the problem is that the game cannot decide what type of game it wants to be.  It has many of the trappings in the early game of being a 4X game, but it always seems to bog down into something else by the mid to late game.			"

10 filthy alliens out of 10 Stellaris is a real masterpiece, capable of exciting even a non-strategy player. I personally never play strategy, but stellaris made me change my mind about this game category.I pointed out some major pros and cons at which i would look at while buying the game. Hope you enjoy.Pros:Many possibilities for customisation: you can name ships, fleets, planets, stars, leaders, countries, species... The list goes on. That's a HUGE plus for the game and the players.Long playthroughs. Completing a game or even losing will take you more than 10 hours. This is not Civilization, where you can dominate the world on your third hour. There's also plenty of technology to be researched, so you will not be capped on tech on your 5th hour of playthrough. Modding support. This was the biggest pro for me. You can tweak your game how you want and tons of mods from steam workshop will help you with that.Cons:UI on higher resolutions makes most players's eyes bleed. This is going to be fixed with future updates, cause ui size option is already existent in config fileStagnation late game. This is again patched with beta 1.1 using AI agressiveness sliderNot reallistic AI behavior (going to be patched with mods): AI often not responding to galactic level crisises, AI's always reluctant to trade and deal with the player, making diplomacy much worse.

												Once you are past the initial struggles of getting enough resources and colonizing enough planets the game gets pretty boring.1. AI is bad.2. Terraforming is disappointing. I really like to terraform things in games for some reason. Terraform a barren planet? Nope. Make a tomb world habitable again? Nope, your mighty space empire can't do that.3. Diplomacy is ridiculous. ""Your mighty militarist space empire with superior fleets and navy capacity offering us pathetic pacifists a non-agression pact? WE WON'T ACCEPT, BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE YOU."" Fine, prepare to be destroyed, you stupid bum-holes.4. Energy resource is weird. You can't spend it to buy anything. At first you don't have enought of it, but then you have too much and can't spend it in any way.5. Technology tree isn't great. Getting random tech choices is very meh, I had to wait a ton of time and research bunch of useless techs to get something my empire needs.6. Micromanagement. In the dev diary they've talked about how you are supposed to feel like an emperor and not a clerk. Nope, still feels like I have to micromanage almost everything.Overall feeling: looks pretty, but feels unfinished (promising, though). I wish Paradox would spend more money on gameplay, rather than on all the pretty music and graphics.			"

												It felt like a skeleton of an actual game, no real development, sure you can move around, sure you can scan planets, sure you can be attacked by pirates, these are things we've seen before and are a staple of any strategy game. Played for a couple hours, accomplished nothing really, except hire a captain for every ship in my fleet. When the game is finished maybe ill try again.I mean you can play as Otter people, so i mean that was a little fun....			"

												Much as I would like to recommend this game, I can't, not at the moment. It's a very rough release, with numerous subtle bugs and features that just dont work at all. It's also very, very bare bones, clearly designed as a framework for loads and loads of DLC. If you want the game it'd probably be best to wait a year or two for Stellaris: Complete Edition on sale.If the thought of the hundreds of dollars in DLC that is coming that will flesh the game out and fix and improve it doesnt bother you, it's pretty fun as long as you dont expect too much from it.The devs have layed out some plans for the future in patches, but it sounds like it's all going to be mostly focused on patching and tweaking the base game into a fully functional and stable state (which is very much needed) and any actual new content will almost certainly be paid.Getting pretty salty about stripped down, rushed games with avalanches of overpriced DLC.Stellaris has, however, decided me on not pre-ordering Hearts of Iron IV. Going to wait for the HOIIV:Complete Edition on sale.Of course Paradox might drastically improve things, I'll re-evaluate and re-review.			"

												Shock and surprise, a game just came out and it needs a few tweaks here and there --- that's so rare nowadays, right?! The issues with Stellaris are far outweighed by the positives. It's an engaging game and the AI, contrary to what I've seen suggested by some, is not that bad at all on the higher difficulties ---- although it would be nice if allied fleets were better distributed, instead of all of them just following one of your own fleets. Like all strategy games it could use a slightly more realistic diplomacy, needs more tradeable commodities and better sector management --- all easy fixes though I doubt diplomacy will be improved, bad (or should I say questionable) diplomacy just seems to be a constant for almost all strategy games. If I were to compare Stellaris to the Civ games in terms of development at release, I would suggest vanilla Stellaris is much more advanced and that bodes well for the future. I highly recommend the game for strategy enthusiasts.			"

												For a game like this I really wish there was a way to publish a 'neutral' opinion as Stellaris is just...ok. Which is disappointing from the studio it is coming from and in comparison to Europa Universalis IV or Crusader Kings II.The game is strongest early on when it is a full on space 4X game, the early exploration phase has some of the best moments a game like this has given me and is easily the most replayable part. There are great events, exciting discoveries and lots of really memorable encounters which set a great base for something to be built on. This early game, the research system, quest chains, planetary & ship development and the soundtrack are probably the great strengths of the game.Currently, after the early stages the game really takes a nosedive. The transition to mid-game and expansion into the 'Grand Strategy' segments (which are admittedly significantly simplified compared to Paradox's other games) is not smooth. There is suddenly a real lack of things to do apart from conquering your neighbours, there are areas that obviously need to be filled by a espionage system and robust trade. Overall the game turns into a slog to expand your borders where you are constantly having to take the initiative within a mostly static galaxy full of predominantly passive AI that do not help create memorable characters of themselves. There are also a number of significant bugs including broken event chains and some features not fully implemented, for example you can have an empire of slaves that will never rebel because that ability is currently turned off for them.I am somewhat conflicted about Stellaris as I feel that after a few expansions and more time it will improve dramatically but at the moment it is probably not worth it for most people.

												I'd love to recommend this game right now but unfortunately the lack of polish and content in the mid to end game just doesn't allow that.  I will say it's a great base for a game and if Paradox supports the game with updates like they say they plan to then it very well has the potentially to one of, if not THE, best 4x space strategy game out there.Summary of thoughts (tl;dr):PositivesGraphics are nice throughout and consistent.  They flow well together.  Animates portraits for races are very nice.Early game exploration, questing and constructing keeps you busy during what is usually a very boring part of a 4x gameEmpire construction provides a good number of different options which seem decently balanced NegativesNothing happens from mid game all the way to the end unless you go out and make it.  Even then it can be slow.Lacking information feedback to the player.  This is very puzzling coming from Paradox but the information screens in game are very limited in number and detail and the few that exist are hard to use (no sorting or filtering of lists)There are clearly bugs and unfinished aspects to major game mechanics like sectors and diplomacy Game tends to slow down and lock up in end gameLengthy ExplanationSo I'll go through the game in order but first off I'd like to say at the time of writing this I've played the early game with 3 different civs.  Created about 5 civs and played 1 game until end game.  The one I played until end game was playing basically the Federation from Star Trek so was mostly peaceful unless attacked and such.  I've got all the achievements for the game pretty much other than bugged ones and end game ones.Empire creation is nice.  There are good options and I really like the look of the animated portraits for the races.  They really provided a great number of options too which is wonderful.  They also provide a lot of options for banner symbols (though a few more background options and color choices would be appreciated, already mods out for these though).  They also provide some good choices for racial traits.  All in all it's a nice process with good options.Early game is probably the most fun I've had in a 4x game mostly due to the science ship questing and surveying.  Now I could see this aspect getting stale after playing it numerous times but I'm not there yet.  Usually in a 4x game the early game tends to be a lot of hitting end turn, maybe moving one unit and generally just waiting for things to build up.  Here you tend to be juggling about 5 units from the start to survey and research, build mining and research posts and your fleet to clear out hostile aien space creatures.  Combine all that with the usual space 4x jobs of managing planet tiles, colonization and research and it does a great job of keeping you busy.Mid game it feels like the game is done.  The exact problem other 4x games have in early game this game has in mid and late game; nothing happens, you just wait around for something to come along.  Now as stated before I was playing a peaceful cooperative sort of species so this someone led into this.  Once you have an alliance or federation and you've explored the planets you can up to the borders of those sueround you then the AI just sits back too.  Nobody declares war, there are no big events mid game to keep you busy, there's really nothing at all happening.  Now if you were playing a war civ then  maybe you could keep busy with declaring war but that can only be so exciting if the AI never initiates anything themselves.End game can have some events to spice things up but they are very late and can miss entirely.  In my game I've had the unbiden spawn on the other side of the galaxy in the middle of the 2nd largest civ.  Due to diplomacy bug I can't get military access from them so I have no way to go after the unbiden.  The Unbiden are also growing very very slowly.  So them spawning has basically brought nothing to the game for me because my only options are to declare war against another civ which makes no sense for my empire or ditch my allies and join their alliance just to get access.  I've also been working on trying to tick off a fallen empire by researching sentient AIs but they refuse to declare war on me even though I've refused their demands and was sitting at like -400 or -500 relations.  My AI also hasn't rebelled yet though I've populated a couple planets with them.  So basically since early mid game I've had two very minor wars and other than that for the last 8 hours of play or something ridiculous (hard to estimate, I leave the game running at times) I've been doing nothing but upgrading buildings, colonizing planets as I research unlocks for new planets and otherwise just twiddling my thumbs.  It's been boring.  For the last 3 hours before quiting my campaign I've found myself watching movies with the game running in the background and just alt+tabbing to it when a notice sounds that research complete or a leader died grabs my attention.The game also has a lot of bugs/unifinished aspects.  I've not had as bad of sector AI as some seem to have, mine build up tiles pretty well as long as I keep them supplied with resources.  They aren't perfect though and they really are lacking in dealing with slight out of the ordinary situations like robotic populations (they keep building farms for food that isn't needed).  The real annoying bug though is the regular locking up/freezing of the game since late mid game.  Basically the UI is still responsive but the game will basically pause and not respond for about 10 seconds every few minutes or so.I think the problems are fixable and they've acknowledge some and pledged to work on them so fingers are crossed here.  But right now the game just isn't fun when it needs to be so can't recommend people buy.			"

												I don't like wars. So, a good test for me on a 4X game is when I'm forced (or sucked into unwillingly) a war. If my reaction is ""bah, not worth it"", that's the indication the game is not for me.And this is exactly what happened in Stellaris. Which is a pity because the game seems really the kind of game I can get crazy about. It's space colonization, it weaves a lot of events and interesting well written storylines in the gameplay, inside the great tradition of the space-opera, it's not overwhelmingly complicated so that you are so focused on micromanaging that you lose sight of the big picture, etc.And yet, somehow it fell flat with me. I think what really killed it for me it's diplomacy. There is so much inertia that you can't do anything in most cases, so for the greater part of the game you just stare the other civilizations in the eye with no other options (I also hate that it's always you that has to give presents and such to improve your relationship with the other nations and never the other way around even if you are pretty powerful, very unrealistic).Also, everything is very different and yet feels the same: you have many handles you can turn to personalize your civilization, and yet you don't see this difference in the game except for the different modifier in diplomacy. Even the governments are a missed opportunity: they do not have any impact in your civilization whatsoever except the name and the method of change of leader (the game does not simulate at all what happens inside your civilization - no internal strife, or tensions between factions, or interesting events... it's a totally dull affair -why giving leaders names if they are totally flat?-, as are the elections, whose impact seems to be just to give a different quest to get influence points and some change to your bonuses).Speaking of influence, I'm less negative with respect to the first hours in the game, but I still think it's a bad mechanism.Mind you, there are cool things in the game, and the first hours are delightful in discovering all the new stuff there's inside the game. But I discovered myself not finding any real pleasure in playing it, because the things that irritate me are more than those I liked. Thus, when a neighbour civilization declared war to me for no real reason, I mjust shrug my shoulders and stopped playing.I hope the next patches will change the situation (the good thing about Paradox is that you can always hope so), but for now, Stellaris stays unused in my library.

												Beautiful game with amazing potential.Several Key problems-Ai is broken, during war they follow you around and never attack on their own.-Very few official trading options, I find trading is very limited and doesn't really play any big part -Crisis bug that can be game ending since there is literally no way to official kill the ""scourge"" , you can't take over scourge planets or cleanse them. Soon after they respawn a new army this can be game ending.-Once again dumb ai that doesn't seem to care about the powerful alien scourge that is devouring the galaxy Until the AI is fixed and the bug against the scourge is fixed I cannot suggest this game to anyone that wants to play solo. You will need to mod out the scourge (which as a event i actually liked) and you will need to rely on playing with other people as the AI isn't very exciting. Also very few tradding options makes the game very lack luster (the only thing to do is war and colonize planets), once again mods can add to this but the game is still new and I don't feel I should dig through mods to get a full game. I will most likely update this once new patches come out that hopefully fix the issues i described.  "

												TL;DR: get this game on a heavy discount. It's too dry.I will say this: the game is fun enough at the start for you to think you made a great buy, and then play it for long enough to pass the return policy timing. You will spend many of these hours being impressed by some of the surface brilliance the game pushes (art work and music is great), and probably learning the various details of the game (like weapon types/enemy types/travel mechanics etc).Afterwhich, you'll start to think that maybe this wasn't the best buy, because there is a kind of repetitive dryness to the game that I can't quite put my finger on. There isn't much in the way of complex AI, trading, diplomacy, or battle mechanics. It seems like the AI will engage in what is largely the same type of ""camp-then-mass attack"" tactics as a bad TW game.And in response you will attempt to do basically the same, building enough of what you need (which isn't diverse or complex enough to be sustainably interesting), then attempting to blitz the opposing sectors. And you will rinse and repeat that process until you have, after many dry hours, taken over enough to the galaxy to win.The game, in the longer run, leaves much to be desired.			"

												This review will only touch on the game breaking performance issues and the bugs.  Everything runs smooth on an Intel i7, GT 750, 16GB, and an SSD, UNTIL mid to late game.  Then there is just stuttering everywhere, its impossible to really do anything.  Add that on top of the fact that the AI for your own navy is just terrible.  Don't let your ships get ""stuck"" between two enemies.  It doesn't know what to do, gets confused, and just sits there.  You can't do anything but retreat which takes a bunch of hitpoints away from your overall health (hull).  Its terrible in the current state.  Hoping that they fix the issues, because the early game is extremely fun.  However the game was rushed without testing to make a buck, very disappointing.			"

												Once you are past the initial struggles of getting enough resources and colonizing enough planets the game gets pretty boring.1. AI is bad.2. Terraforming is disappointing. I really like to terraform things in games for some reason. Terraform a barren planet? Nope. Make a tomb world habitable again? Nope, your mighty space empire can't do that.3. Diplomacy is ridiculous. ""Your mighty militarist space empire with superior fleets and navy capacity offering us pathetic pacifists a non-agression pact? WE WON'T ACCEPT, BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE YOU."" Fine, prepare to be destroyed, you stupid bum-holes.4. Energy resource is weird. You can't spend it to buy anything. At first you don't have enought of it, but then you have too much and can't spend it in any way.5. Technology tree isn't great. Getting random tech choices is very meh, I had to wait a ton of time and research bunch of useless techs to get something my empire needs.6. Micromanagement. In the dev diary they've talked about how you are supposed to feel like an emperor and not a clerk. Nope, still feels like I have to micromanage almost everything.Overall feeling: looks pretty, but feels unfinished (promising, though). I wish Paradox would spend more money on gameplay, rather than on all the pretty music and graphics.			"

Posted: December 27, 2016
												I really don't know what's going on in Paradox for this latest generation of games (HOI IV and this). Stellaris is not a bad game... its just a lesser version of EU IV with a space theme. To be clear... I am not saying Paradox should not try new things. The issue with this game is the same issue that plagues Hearts of Iron IV, a farse of an UI. EU IV has perhaps the best UI of all Paradox games - it is relevatively easy to learn but offers all the numbers you could ever wish for. Stellaris on the other hand decides to make the UI at lot more simple and all the useful numbers have been replaced by vague approximations (superior, inferior, equivalent, etc.). And that would be fine... If not for the fact that combat is almost entirely based on numbers. Granted, late game you're probably either already winning or already losing so a non specific approximation is probably all you need. Early game, 1 extra ship can be the difference between winning you first War or losing horribly - which is exactly what had happened in one of my games. In that round my enemy had one extra ship, something I could have never known since all signs (population, number of planets, etc.) seemed to have indicated that I should have been able to easily outnumber them. And again this wouldn't be a problem... IF Stellaris had an actual combat system rather than a amoeba simulation. As much as I would love a combat system along the lines of a space Total War, the EU IV system would be enough - by which I mean that certian terrain (or in this case, certian tracts of space) have ups and downs to attacking or defending. Instead in Stellaris all you get is two or more blobs doing basic subtraction from each other with minor modifiers based on ship layout - which early game is close to irrevelent. To sum it up... EU IV is just a better game. Hopefully Endless Space 2 will serve as a superior alternative this this once it comes out.			"

												Stellaris is in many ways an addictive, humorous and entertaining 4X game, however many of the design elements clash and I've been left feeling somewhat salty about the entire affair. While the AI can cut you down in a single burst and end your campaign with a single fleet at times, it's other mechanics that has left me agitated. There is too much of the dev's trying to make you play the game their way instead of creating a framework for fun. Give the player the option to use automation, or not and let them be responsible for their enjoyment. There is no good reason to not allow automation of scouts and building upgrades when you're going to force us to use the frankly terrible sector system (locked automation of sets of planets) that is basically the cancer of the game. Much like other 4X games the research system is mostly pointless, deciding which tech comes first is a very minor level of interesting gameplay - I would love to see more real choices, which would contribute to making each playthrough more unique. Fleet capacity should not be tied with space stations. Jesus christ. The game is also lacking a lot of overlays that you might expect, useful information screens regarding other races - in particular alliances and federations. With all that said, the game is far from all bad, and there's lots of humorous elements with the interaction between species and the exploration elements. Wars and war demands are fun and make for a more balanced feel to combat. Overall, the game feels like something in beta. and I would recommend waiting to buy. With a bit of luck DLC and patches can fix some of these game breaking gripes. (I'm looking at you, sectors.)			"

												I read some of the other reviews and the main criticism seems to center around 2 issues. The first being that the game feels and plays a bit rough and seems incomplete. To that I say, give it a month or two, the updates that have come out have already dramatically improved the game, and the quality of the game itself more than makes up for it. Also, these complaints if stacked up against almost any other ""incomplete"" game on steam don't really hold water. Go play one of the survival alphas that cost 30 bucks and are so buggy you'd be lucky to successfully do what the devs demonstrated in the trailer, or play whatever new steaming pile of excrement slurped out of treyarch this week for console and come back and talk about how complete stellaris is.The second big complaint is that mid-late game play is redundant, boring, and or lacking content. Well, to some extent I'd have to agree with that criticism, but at the same time I'd say this is the exact same complaint you might level at ck2 or eu4. Everyone who's played eu4 extensively knows of that moment when your empire is so strong that the game becomes easy and you can just bulldoze through entire continents. Stellaris operates much in the same way, so it has many of the same pit falls in terms of playability you encounter in eu4.If you're willing to overlook a bit of early bugginess, and so far a slight lacking in content and you want to play an intricate sci fi empire game with an almost tedious amount of detail this is for you. If you're maybe possibly not entirely sure that genocide is a bad idea and want to murder all of the other species/people you encounter, this game is for you. If you like eu4 and eu4 in space is what you pray to Gaben for every night before you go to bed, well, it has arrived.			"

10 filthy alliens out of 10 Stellaris is a real masterpiece, capable of exciting even a non-strategy player. I personally never play strategy, but stellaris made me change my mind about this game category.I pointed out some major pros and cons at which i would look at while buying the game. Hope you enjoy.Pros:Many possibilities for customisation: you can name ships, fleets, planets, stars, leaders, countries, species... The list goes on. That's a HUGE plus for the game and the players.Long playthroughs. Completing a game or even losing will take you more than 10 hours. This is not Civilization, where you can dominate the world on your third hour. There's also plenty of technology to be researched, so you will not be capped on tech on your 5th hour of playthrough. Modding support. This was the biggest pro for me. You can tweak your game how you want and tons of mods from steam workshop will help you with that.Cons:UI on higher resolutions makes most players's eyes bleed. This is going to be fixed with future updates, cause ui size option is already existent in config fileStagnation late game. This is again patched with beta 1.1 using AI agressiveness sliderNot reallistic AI behavior (going to be patched with mods): AI often not responding to galactic level crisises, AI's always reluctant to trade and deal with the player, making diplomacy much worse.

Bad: Lacks content, even with customizable ships (which don't seem so attracting if you have a simple toggle that autogenerates the best (in what?) combination for you) and races. Techs quit bringing anything new after a while and become just upgrades to weapon damage, buildings etc. The fact that you can't really select what you research because the options are random leads to situations where you can be wholly under- or overpowered compared to your neighbours or just simply stuck with not being able to nothing because you only have corvettes with level 5 autocannons or something similar.AI is terrible in waging war, both against and with you, sending single corvettes against you as an enemy or following you with a huge blob of a fleet without actually intelligently engaging anything as an ally. If you were to get destroyed the fleet will disperse to guard the AI's space.Waging war is also difficult due to the fact that enemy ships can quite freely pass through your territory and if you don't have any sensors you can't see them before they are hacking your home world to pieces.Graphics lag if you raise the match speed, battles are ♥♥♥♥♥torms that could be dealt with in an orderly manned instead of ramming two swarm AI's into each other and consuming what little juice your computer has left.

A lot like Civ V actually, without Gandhi the Nuclear Doombringer.Races are difficult to distinguish in galaxy view because they can have same colors.

												I'd reccomend waiting to see if they flesh out the late game.Early game is great fun though, but the diplomacy is painfully basic and most events come from science ships and technologies. Given you can't access the borders of another empire to conduct science, that source of events stops; as they do from technology after a certain point. There's a lot good about this game, but I'm pretty disappointed by the late game and would not reccommend it.   "

Posted: May 24, 2016
												Hello all and welcome to my review of Stellaris. This game is a 4X strategy game with an aerial (top-down) view where the object is to conquer the universe. I will try my best to give a non-objective view of the game for someone interested in playing it.The first thing I would like to say about this game that no one ever mentions with 4X games is that this game is a strategy game, not a tactical game. I mention this as strategy and tactics are two totally separate things. Strategy is the planning, coordination, and general direction of military operations to meet overall political and military objectives (or ‘long-term’). Tactics implement strategy by short-term decisions on the movement of troops and employment of weapons on the field of battle. Another way to put it is “Tactics is the art of using troops in battle; strategy is the art of using battles to win the war”. There are games out there that include both tactics and strategy, but Stellaris is not one of them. As long as you accept this before you begin, you won’t judge this game unfairly. Your race has both a cosmetic and practical element. Cosmetically I won’t go in too deep here as people’s taste and opinions vary, but there are many options to choose from in how your race looks, the naming conventions, and the look of your ships. Practical elements include racial traits (Are you strong/smart/charismatic?), ethos (What do you believe in?), and government (How do your beliefs define your people). Government can be changed in-game, racial traits can be ‘adjusted’, and ethos stays where it is for the most part. Government is also directly related to ethos, and some government types are specifically included or excluded based off of your race’s ethos. You can play and win in multiple different ways, but the win condition is conquering-based (‘control X planets’ or ‘defeat all other races’), and not ‘tech-based’, ‘objective-based’, or ‘resource-based’ as many other 4X games have. In this game, tech, money, and resources in general are means to an end and not the end themselves. Having a strategic advantage (be it tech, money, resources, diplomacy, etc) in this game is important only if you exploit it. Most of this game focuses around two things; your ‘core’ systems (5+, depending on government and tech), and sectors (areas given to a governor to control with a small return given). You only manage your core, which is fairly simple but has strategic elements, so you don’t have to spreadsheet your way to victory nor auto-play the game either. The tech-tree is based off a 'weighed' system giving you three options over three different areas, with more common tech's having greater weight then rare or dangerous techs. Pro’s:-Good variety of racial options, both functional and cosmetic (maybe some more traits)-Balance between different traits, ethos, and government; no ‘weak links’-Simple but fun ship customization, planet management, sector managementCon’s:-Interface isn’t difficult but it’s not intuitive either. -Races are not aggressive when it comes to expansion-Non-existent tactics; combat is viewing onlyRecommendation:I recommend this game if you want a strategy game with a simple but robust tech tree, planetary system management, and race customization. This game has its faults; it needs a boost to the AI in terms of aggression and utilization of technology and resources. Just remember that this game focus on strategy and not tactics. Note: editing may be done for grammar reasons; content will be functionally the same "

												I'm not sure how much alchohol is required to make this game fun, but I'm pretty sure that what ever level that is, its also fatal.  Pro's : Top notch Sci-Fi stuff happing.  Honestly, if they didn't have this to read, I would have noticed how bad that game was within the refund period.  Its genuinely entertianing, no joke.Con's: Everything else.  Space combat is run by AI, Tactics are entirely based on exploiting AI OCD, and then only by running your decoy fleet around in circles while your main fleet does its thing.  The empire building is only micro-managed up to a point where you are required to turn over large sections of your empire to the AI... not influenced by the player, just AI run. (FUN!) War is based on making demands, then negotiation of peace through being a bigger pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥than your AI enemy... but victory will often be achieved by your AI sector commanders just auto-colonizing enough planets to win the game.  Winning a game of stellaris ia about as climactic as seeing an ""achievement unlocked"" pop-up after days of suffering with one of the worst UI's every foised upon gamers.I do not understand how people can upvote this game.  It has heart, its got a good core idea, but it's implimentation is just soooooooooo boring.			"

												I like a lot of things about this game. That being said, I absolutely hate the way it handles war. If you go to war with someone, you have to declare what you want if you win. Then while fighting, the game tallies up points. So if you conquer a planet, it's not really yours. You just scored some points. Defeat a fleet? more points. The game knows exactly how to get the most out of these points, of course. I had 3 worlds cut off from me so I went to war (they were going to attack me anyway) to get them re-connected. I conquered 4 of his planets, broke 7 starbases and killed a ton of his ships. AND I LOST. he didn't once come into my core worlds. He just pinged those 3 worlds over and over and took over half my empire  when he ""won"" (that was completely undamaged since he never went there).I'm sorry but that concept is stupid. So when 2 empires duke it out, no matter how much they hate each other they follow some arbitrary points system to determine the victor?!?			"

												The sector AI is broken. Until they fix it, dont buy this game.Short and sweet. Its a great game, I LOVE it, spend hours at a time playing it. But its broken. Not just ""oh this doesnt work well i think you have a bug"" but legit broken, and it all happens at the point where you need the game to work...making sectors.For those who dont know, you have a colony limit. You can olny colonize x amount of worlds efficiently. If you want to colonize more, you need to make sectors. Sectors, in short, are chunks of your empire that you can give to the games AI and have it run it for you, thus freeing up influence and colony limits. But as beautful as the game is, this part of the AI is so under developed it doesnt work.When setting up the sector there is no gauging resources, either you get a pen and paper, write down and record your resources per area, and do the math yourself on whether or not you have too many or too few planets in your sector for it to sustain itself, or, you do trial and erro, and pay 25 influence points per mistake per planet til you get it right. Oh sure you can give your sector resources manually from your main empire...in single instalment chunks, not allowing you to fix the problem at all. Need to remove some planets from the sector so it doesnt collapse on itself, tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ pay up, 25 influence per planet.""So wait a minute, if your sector is say, short on energy credits, why not just rebuild some of the planet structures to make more"" HAH cant do that, its controlled by the computer now. Want control back? thatll be 25 influence per planet. ""Well why not tell the AI to do it."" HAHAHA cause its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and cant even figure out how rebuild planet buildings to meet your desired ""sector focus"", let alone to keep from killing itself via starvation. ""Well why not in the selction area where you tell it to produce military/minerals/energy etc you just hit the 'sustain' option"" *clears throat* CAUSE IT DOESNT EXIST. Either it changes all the planets buildings to one selection, or the others, no multi selector no balance.This game is AMAZING AND I LOVE IT... but this isnt some graphical bug or scripting issue. If your playing on any galaxy size bigger then ""tiny, the smallest one"" you NEED sectors. Its literally one of the most important parts of the game, and its so broken, it LITERALLY can destroy your empire from within in a matter of 30 minutes.Until they fix it, dont buy this game.			"

Ironically this game has the least amount of possibilities of the paradox games, they all follow the same worklike path.It is actually more of a chore than fun. I was hopefully that it would improve, but the first DLC is a few portaits and ship skins, no actual meaningful content.			"

												So far this game is extremely fun. I can't think of any other word, but ""fun"" is the best way to describe it. The game is full of strange and interesting quirks like space amoeba that roam different star systems and planets orbitting black holes or nebulae. Unusual anomalies with rich stories behind them make the game feel more real and engaging. As for the mechanics, everything seems to flow more easily than previous paradox games. Having clocked nearly 200 hours on EU4 and CK2 I can safely say that Stellaris is much easier to get into, but also equally complex and interesting. I've always wanted a 4X space game like this, and it really stand out in this genre. In my opinion, it's the best scifi grand strategy out there.			"

												RIght now, okay-good game. Later, probably, will be great game.I think the primary issue with this game, beyond solveable ones like optimization and gameplay that are being modifed quite literally as I type this, and that no doubt will be perfected through patches and DLC (as is done in all PDX games), is that it recquires a different type of roleplaying to enjoy.Most PDX grand strategies require roleplaying to enjoy, but with most of them the framework for the player\'s interaction with the world is easy, as its based in actual history. It is much easier to design a scenario where a character plays as Matilda, Duchess of Tuscany and where the player is able to play that role to their satisfaction, as real life has done much of the setting and characterization for them. This is especially notable in PDX\'s primary market, which would be people with an interest in history. With that in mind, having a goal-less game is easier, as the player is really interacting with a history for amusement, rather than attempting to meet some standard set by the game.Stellaris is different. There are goals set, yes, but they are fairly unimaginative and have very little involvement in game events; they also force you to play as an expansive empire. But, mostly, there is no history to interact with. Everything here is up the player\'s devising. Sure, there\'s references to other space operas, and this game is undeniably a space opera, its just that its so open-ended that, in order to have an experience similar to say, CK2, the player will have to manufacture characters and plots and flavor themselves.I do this fairly easy. Thus, once they fix mechanics and optimizing and other such things, I will be able to enjoy the game quite a bit. Others, however, will see this as bland and flavorless, and that is their right.I still reccomend the game, though. This price point, which would have made me balk a decade ago, is now a full $20 less than the AAA industry standard for a base game. The DLC will be expensive as a total, but as with all PDX games the basic features of each will be included in a patch, and much of the dlc will be cosmetic, in this case perhaps new ships and races. DLC is annoying, yes, but its the state of the industry, and I think PDX is one of the few companies that does it correctly, with each release being a fairly large game changer.If you REALLY like sci fi strategy games where you build and maintain empires in a space opera setting, I\'d reccomend Stellaris, as it will probably shape up to be really good compared to the ones out now. If you like historical grand strategy games like the rest of what PDX does, I would hold off and wait a while. The game will certainly improve, but whether it does so in a way equitable to those types of players, I am not sure.			"

												Use Hyperflight travel and this is basically Space Empires III Paradox-style. This game is exactly what I was hoping for and more!Of course, in typical Paradox 4x fashion, this game is but a fraction of what it could and most likely will be. Not saying it's not worth buying at the moment, because Ive put in almost 80 hours and I'm still having a blast. 9/10			"

												Not Paradox's best work by any means, but a decent game nonetheless. The first few hours I found to be incredibly fun, researching new tech and finding my Empire's place in the galaxy. After the fun of exploring the unknown is gone, you're left with a somewhat more boring version of Spore's Galatic era. There's some fun stuff in here, like the late game crisis' that occur. They can really shakeup the aforementioned slow late game. That's just not enough to really make the whole game feel worthwhile. Since the latest patch, a lot of the things that annoyed me were fixed, but there's still a lot of missing features (to be DLC I'm sure) and design choices that I question. Overall, it's certainly not a bad game. But it's not that great either, in its current state anyway. Stellaris has the potential to be another Paradox great, but it's lacking depth right now. I would wait another year, after a few DLC's have come out, then try to pick it up on sale.			"

												Game requires too many mods to fix/address glitches/bug/ poor development to run, for instance fighters and bombers orbit your ships instead of going out and attacking, got a mod to fix it. The vanilla (base game) is lacking in the tech tree, diplomacy options, conquest system, and ship types. Combat is extremely stale and consist of tossing your large numerically superior force at another, or running away. Thier are no tactical options, or any control besides retreating once forces have met, and the ship combat AI at times has your ships turn away from the enemy fleet and not fire and just get shot up, or some such. This is extremely frustrating to me, and im sure other players as all you can do is watch and bang your head as your fleet preforms horribly.			"

												It kinda sneaks up on you. First you're just piddling around the galaxy, exploring systems and colonizing planets. Then you start running into other empires, but it's still not overwhelming. Eventually you're making trade deals, negotiating border access, earning warscore and wait a sec, am I playing a Grand Strategy game now?I've never really been a big strategy game fan. RTS was never my thing, and Grand Strategy seemed way too intimidating to get into. However, spacehips are rad, so I figured I'd give the game a shot. I never expected the game to get its hooks in me like it has.I have heard that it lacks some complexity of more mature Paradox titles, but if you're looking to dip your toes in the genre you probably won't find a better opportunity.

												8.5/10The first time I played this game I said ''Wow!'' because of the complex and customizable races. After many hours played on this game I realize many things.Is it a good 4X game? Yes it is,The experience is very nice because you have to lead many things : Explorations, ressources, military, diplomacy, Leaders RP, politicies, planet management, science research and so on. Every aspect has traits, score or abilities. The races are infinte combinations like a weird and awful ugly bird but peacefully for example.It's an amazing and wonderful the strategy game.Probably the best 4X game I've ever played.I've got to say BUT. Even with the hundreds of possibility of your empire could have. It has to end wtih war. Be cause the victory conditions is a Big problem in Stellaris to me. And there is no settings in the game for this. Many gamers felt the same thing about it. Paradox have to expand the winning condition and not stick with only domination or elimination conditions.You could make it your own way of course, but thats why setting exists for the others.This game has a great potential and they promised updates And DLC will see....

												A great mix between 4x and grand strategy. Beautiful and one of the best ost's in year. Starts extremely strong with a lot of events, which add a lot of flavor and a pretty good especially if you like sci-fi. It  unfortunately falters mid game and falls apart on end game.  There are almost no events happening later in the game and i finished the whole tech tree (seemingly) by early mid game so afterwards it was random bonuses (+5 to food, +5 to kinetic weapons etc). The energy weapons seemed extremely overpowered but that may have been our playthrough.Despite its flaws played it co-op and had a ton of fun. Worth it to play now and i am sure when more things get added (or moded) it will become an excellent game.			"

												I start on a small planet in the corner of the galaxy, when I find that my two neighbouring races are fallen empires (aka attack them = RIP). I establish embassies with both to smooth relations with them, until I realise that one is a xenophile and loves me so much they let me take some of their territory by me pushing my borders against theirs. I then join an alliance with the smallest races in the galaxy, we then attack an enemy with superior power, and overcome them through sneaking our armies around their navy and landing on their planets. Our alliance becomes the biggest alliance in the galaxy after several wars. Our alliance then takes up almost the entire galaxy. The end (or is it.....?)			"

												I had high hopes for this game. It has its moments, but it is boooring as H - E - Double Hockey Sticks (yes, Hell) in the late game. So, I quit my game nearly a year ago because I was so bored out of my freaking mind. I couldn't stomach the slooow grind of slowly killing off the AI competition. Declaring War is a complete joke with these ""War Goals"". My god, why are you taking something as simple as declaring war on your enemy and making it so tedious and boring? Drag your war goals from the left and choose which empire to give it too. Like I would ever give a conquered planet to my AI ally. Screw that. With the War Goals you can NEVER wipe out your enemy in one war or 10 wars if you're playing on a large galaxy UNLESS that enemy happens to have a planet or two. otherwsie, the wars are loooong and you get so little for your efforts and then you have to fight again later, repeat the process over and over and over again. And during your war, let's say you occupy a planet with your troops and you win the war, BUT that planet is NOT part of your war goals, sorry you don't get to keep it. Like who is going to enforce it if I decided to just stay. Alas, it is the game mechanics that enforces it. Because it's not like there is a United Planets that could give a rat's♥♥♥♥♥what you do. No, the game is just programmed that way. It's Nuts! And not realistic at all.So, I decided to give Leviathans a try. Especially since it promised to correct the boring late game. The screwy war mechancis are still there. They're not going anywhere unfortunately. So, I'm cruising along in the game having fun (with the exception of the war mechanics), making it further than the first game. Then I make it to the Late game. How do I know, because the stupid Ytrellians declare war on me. I am the most powerful player in the universe, besides Ytrellians and Jakly. Now, they didn't declare war at first. They offered for me to be their Vassal. BS. So, I declined and they attacked. Now the power metric showed their fleet power ""superior"" to mine. Ok, but it no longer said ""overwhelming"". So, I thought I might have a chance to build up, hit and run, other crap like that. No, No, when I first saw their fleet they had 161K to my two fleets power of about 78K combined. And of course they tore right through me and started destroying everything in their path. B F'ing S that crap! Severely overbalanced and not at all fun. I am not about to play a game AGAIN for 46 hours in the last two weeks as of this writing (4/20/17), only to have a severely overbalanced ""end game"" boss empire destroy me and my fun literally overnight. No strategy involved in that. The programmers simply said, ""Ok we F'ed up our base game in the late game play and made it boring, many people complained, so we have decided to F them up by programming the Leviathans DLC to screw our customers royaly if they buy Leviathans."" I would request a refund, but I know Steam would reject it since it's been more than 3 days. And you can't play Leviathans to the end game within 3 days time to realize you screwed up by purchasing it!!I really wanted to love this game. Too bad.			"

												If ever there were a game I wished you could give a thumbs sideways to, it's this one. I'm not recommending it mainly to counteract its current ""very positive"" status. Because many of those reviews are ssimilarly hesitant.I like it. It's good. But like many people, I was hoping for more grand strategy in space. What I got was in many ways Endless Space but tweaked. It's really, on the whole, quite a simple game. If you've played any 4X game, you understand 95% of the systems in Stellaris. And it is a 4X game, not a grand strategy game, and a not particularly complex 4X game at that.There are no dyanstic mechanics, the variations in races aren't nearly enough, superficially or mechanically, as they diverge.  Diplomacy isn't fully fleshed out, federations and alliances are far too limited. There are maaaaaaaaaaaaaany bugs. Alien races all seem to contact you telling you they're establishing embassies with themselves when they mean with you, events are constantly filled with placeholder text and missing entities.I won't go too in-depth on all the problems or even LIST all the problems, as that woudl take a while - it is a big game after all. But to further elaborate on one of the big ones: you can form alliances and federations with other races. This is the most basic thing they could do, really. Alliances are just, ""Hey, we've got each others' backs, so step off."" That's it. Nothing else to them. In fact, they actually LIMIT your diplomatic options with alliance members.Federations are the next step. They're the UN. Except there are no resolutions to pass. The president rotates. They can declare war and design a new federation ship. And that boils down to, ""Oh, I'm the president. WE'RE AT WAR WITH MY NEIGHBOR; I WANT THEIR♥♥♥♥♥♥""There is no way to change rules and regulations for federations. You can't be a peaceful or warlike one, forbidding instigation of conflict or demanding contribution to a federation fleet, for example. You can't change the rulership style. There's so much potential, but it ends up so frustratignly limited. Your federation ends up being whatever the rotating president at the time wants it to be. This works a bit better in multiplayer, I'm sure, but♥♥♥♥♥♥ who has the time for that. Not me. I play singleplayer. I have a job.In addition, bugs and missing features aside, some of the features that do exist are just silly. You need to occupy a planet to get someone to cede it. Sort of makes sense in theory, but... why? Isn't bombarding it from orbit kinda enough? Especially if the enemy is desperate for peace?On the whole, it's a disappointing game, but not unfun, and it's a solid base. With modding support and, hopefully, Paradox's general tendency to provide big, worthwhile updates, fixes, and DLC, it will be worth buying and playing for many many hours a year from now or so.As it is now, don't make my mistake. Be patient; wait for fixes and more content and more mods. Play or replay Endless Space. That's what it makes me want to do right now.			"

												Amazing game. There are plenty of negative reviews and they have reasonable points, but it\'s only because of the perspective from which they choose to view the game. Depending on the person, this game is either a skeleton with no content fraught with bugs and bad AI and etc, or a content-rich boundary-pushing genre-defining game. I\'m 100 hours in and I still have much to learn. This game is awesome and it\'ll only keep getting better.On the topic of how Paradox is going to handle it\'s future development, I don\'t know Paradox so I can\'t comment. People say they like to release tons of DLC. I don\'t like that idea but I\'m happy with the game as it is right this moment - it was worth 40 dollars, and this is coming from an incredibly stingy person.			"

												 The system requirements are wrong, I played this on my mac which meets all the requirements and it was a dreadful experience. For the first two hours or so the game was running smoothly, but after I got a fleet of 40 ships all the fights became a glitchy mess, my screen starts flickering and the ships start flying around all over the screen, after two hours of gameplay there is so much stuff going on that the game starts lagging like hell and any interaction with my ships just makes it even worse, by this time I have a fleet of 160 corvettes and if I try to move them all at once the game freezes, if I make them fight another fleet of a similar size the game crashes. By now the game is so glitchy that all my pops\' portraits are just an unrecognisable glitchy mess (like MissingNo from pokemon), opening most menus makes the screen flicker and it gave me several headaches, and opening the contacts and species menu makes the game crash which makes it so the genetic modification and uplift techs are useless. In conclusion: don\'t trust the mac system requirements, and keep in mind that most of these issues only appear in the late game, so you\'re not gonna be able to refund it.			"

			This is the cosmetic portion of the 40K: Twilight of the Imperium mod. All major races as well as a few minor races are available to be used.		


Unlike previous Paradox Strategy games of their complex learning curves, this one is less stressful and easy to understand once you get used to it especially Trial and Errors. Its the perfect space x4 strategy that others have fail to perfected.True its bare standard upon released and to be expected DLCs but Mods will keep you very entertain when they start rolling with a month and so.

												After playing this game for almost 200 hours, I can say that it is the ground work for a great game, but as it is, it's not bad, but it's not really good either.  And many of the problems it has you'd think the developer would've known how to avoid after making games like HoI3 and EUIV, but somehow they seemed to have forgotten most of these critical features.  Luckily, like most Paradox games, they will be making many updates and improvements over time.  Hopefully that won't cost a small fortune in DLC though.Pros:Good graphicsVarious exploration and galactic eventsDiverse government and race typesMultiple races are actually handled properlyDesigning ships and stations is pretty easyResearch is not all one type, but instead is split into physics, society, and engineering (about time someone realized that not all scientists are experts in all fields and can just bounce between them with no regard for their specialty)Stations can be used to increase your amount of resources and expand your borders, not just build defensesResearch costs scale with empire population size, so you can't just blob out and expect to out tech everyone instantlyCons:Full scale bombardment is the most pathetic bombardment ever, it should not take a huge fleet years to do minor damage to a planetControlling/Upgrading/Building Armies is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥(why can't they act like, you know, garrisoned transports, so you can control group them, and send them to a location)Armies don't heal while in transports, making landing and sorting through the damaged ones a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥br>Combat balance is non-existent, armor, shields, energy weapons, armor pen, missiles, pd and ballistics all need to be reworkedDefending your empire is basically impossible due to the lack of sensor range, pathetic defense stations, and no way to slow down an enemy fleet from jumping without them jumping on that station and instantly killing itSpace Combat encourages doom stacks with only one or two minor fleets to go around killing enemy stationsInterface is completely useless once you get past your core planet limit, making it way harder to build ships, upgrade starports, do terraforming, colonize, quickly check who's allied with who, who's fighting who than it should beSome notifications pop up way too much, while others don't pop up enough (why no combat warning when my stations are in combat)Ship design needs to have more impact on what type of ship you're trying to make, either a heavy slow armored ship, or a light heavy weapon shipNo control of ships during combat, and no way to give formations or any type of orders beforehandMost ship graphics are overly blocky and don't look like actual ships.  For reference on how to make ships look awesome while allowing multiple sections, look at SotS2.Overall, it's an ok game, but with more work on the interface and the combat balance, the game could be epic.  So for now, I won't recommend it, but once they fix some of these issues, definitely pick it up.			"

												Stellaris starts strong, putting you in charge of a pre-made race that populates the new game screen, or more interestingly, one of the many combinations that can be made to make your own unique race or variety of human, with various traits and ethics and bonuses from government forms.The early-game is very much exploration and colonisation, with a variety of alien life not of another empire and the various event mechanics put to good use in anomalies that pop up as you survey. There are others that occur, tied to your colonies either through the previous anomalies discovering something or their own, seperate unique chains. Anomalies can range from everything to a resource or research boon, either on the planet or to your stockpile, to out-right changing some world's biosphere's or sending you to discover the secrets of a precursor race, something full of lore that kept my attention through many ingame decades.The tech tree is ""randomized"" with a ""card"" system that draws 3, or more depending on certain techs or government types, cards, allowing you to choose from a selection of techs. You'll eventually see most of the techs - but some are tied to certain ethics and will never be seen whilst playing an opposing one, while others are rare and can take many a shuffle to re-appear. The tech tree also continues beyond actual techs, to minimally rewarding ""buff"" statistics. This system is a good compromise between meaningless stat buffs, a randomized tech tree, and a straight up ""plow through this in the most efficient way possible"". The tech system as such gets a solid thumbs up from me, but others may get frustrated by the random nature of it. This is complimented by a debris system where destroyed ships and stations add techs - don't forget to scroll the tech cards to see!The mid-game is where Stellaris begins to lose some of its glamour. The galaxy fills with empires and many a time, you're cut off from exploring. There are still a few events, typically colony ones, here and there, but it becomes a period of saturising your own territory and often war for wars own sake. Personally, I like to fill this time with uplifting - a process of technological enlightenment for some of the planets in the galaxy that start with their own, pre-ftl  or spaceflight civilizations (how cool is that?!) and a few rare worlds with pre-sentient races that require genetic modification. This part of the game is particularly weak, and some of the flaws in the systems meant to ease micromanagement falter.The late-game becomes a traditional game of jockeying for power, with wars now serving a purpose of dealing with real rivals and threats that the mid-game doesn't quite seem to give. Most importantly, the true end-game crises begin in 2 flavours. The game has 3 end-game crises, that I won't spoil, that really shake things up, providing they don't stall out against a Fallen Empire - the other ""end game"". The end-game crises can wipe out old rivals and new friends alike. Don't underestimate them if they end up on your door and you're not prepared. Sadly due to the Fallen Empire mechanics currently crises can suffer if forced to push through one of these.Fallen Empire's constitute the other, ever-present problem. Coming in four varities with differing views on the galaxy, each knowable by hovering over their ""attitude type"" in the diplomacy screen and from experience of them telling you exactly what they dont like - typically followed by the hammer. They exist from the start of the game and represent the apex of technology, though they have the full tech tree researched, they don't research any further than that. Provided you don't evoke their wrath, build up and take them on for valuable worlds and, if you're lagging behind in tech but adept at strategy and tactics, scanning their debris can offer you a leg up.At this point, the galaxy is what you make of it and imagination and roleplay help. Stellaris features victory screens, but seem to be largely pointless.There are lots of little things and systems inside the game I havn't touched upon here that I would encourage you to seek out and enjoy, particularly special systems that spawn, systems such as slavery and, of course, genocide, though you know, be nice! Even with all my time in the game, I'm still uncovering new things and experiencing new events and new emergent stories.Also, you can have an actual Earth with the proper texture, what's not to love? Oh, and if you're aliens.. Sol is out there somewhere!-----Pros:-A Strong Start, with fun customization leading to your own, unique characterization, particularly as you explore and pull back the veil.-Damn pretty for a Clausewitz game. Most of the game is wonderful to look at.-Lots of little touches and in particular some of the events and anomalies add atmosphere-Fallen Empire's offer a unique twist to the galaxy-Tech and debris offer an enjoyable overall system-You can build robots and give them rights.-End-Game Crises shake up the late-game galaxy.-A fantastic emergent storyline that arises out of these systems can lead to great ~roleplay~ if you care for that.-Multiplayer is incredibly stable.-Game is stable in general.-Moddability.Cons:-Sector AI is wonky and the AI in general can be wonky.-Galaxy can become static, though this is largely due to the game seeming to love to fill it with pacifists, a minor deviation from this pacifists for all makes things much more violent - and even pacifists go to war. It's a problem I've not noticed but one I know occurs.-AI is slow to expand. It doesn't weight certain colony techs as high as a player would and consequently takes it's time. It will, however, do so en masse in time.-A few minor localization bugs and one rather moderate multiplayer bug I've found, though it doesn't affect stability.-Combat a little wonky and brawly.-Slaves can't currently rebel, making this broken if you min-max that route.-----I've mentioned a few of the flaws in this as we've gone through. Critically, mid-game suffers from not being fleshed out as the early game, nor with the threats posed in the late game. This is being somewhat addressed by the upcoming 1.1 patch, and should be treated accordingly. Some say the universe feels a little lifeless without civilian traffic and such - this is hopefully being made an addition in 1.3, but is not ""critical"".The 1.1 patch will also address a number of small AI issues, and larger ones related to sector management. Personally, I've noted lots of minor niggling flaws that I essentially could argue as being ""inefficient"" - and so I just let the sector AI do what it wants, but understand the problems others have.One major stumbling block is currently how end-game crises are treated as ""wildlife"" and not at war with AI empires, allowing things such as the ""at peace"" fallen empire fleet respawn to occur, thus preventing the crises from knocking them out, as well as how the AI empires in general only react to the end-game crises assaults if they are actively threatening important worlds. This is hopefully being fixed, for the latter, in 1.1.The mid-game slump is also due to be addressed by the 1.2 patch, with further flavour and life added in 1.3 - you may wish to hold off on your purchase till 1.1, if not 1.2.Stellaris is a solid game, and despite its flaws and small bugs, though sometimes numerous, are all easily redeemable. Critically, none of the problems seem to be with the core mechanics and more with execution and the always tempermental AI.Currently, a lot of mods address issues and add new gameplay. This is a blessing for the moddability and future of the game - but also a remark on how some dislike the combat, so go in with eyes wide open.This is easily a recommendable purchase, but for those who want a ""cleaner"" experience I do advise waiting until 1.2. 1.1 if you can forgive a slower mid-game.

												The main problem in this game are two things: AI and UI. Unfortunately both are pretty important for a 4x game and both are unlikely to be improved soon.The game has some good ideas and the basics of a 4x game are definitely there. Especially the exploration part is well done and at the beginning it's also fun to expand your empire. However, there are way too many problems which suck the fun out. For me the main problem are the sectors: After you have more than 5 planets you are forced to give some of the planets to sectors which are managed by the AI. Afterwards all you can do is watch the AI horribly mismanaging your planets and costing you a lot of resources without being productive. They improved it slightly with patches 1.1 and 1.2 but the main problem remains: It is just not fun expanding your empire just to give it to an AI - even more so if it's an AI with the brain capacity of a lobotomized monkey. There are other problems such as the combat which is simply ""the bigger stack wins"", a concept which I thought game devs today would know to be a bad idea or the UI which requires about twice as many clicks for every action than would be necessary. Actually if the UI would be better, probably less people would complain about micromanaging and there could be better solutions to it than the one currently implemented.Maybe the game will be fun in a year or so, but right now it's pretty obvious you are playing a beta.

												Dear Paradox developers,I really tried to like this game, but there has just not been put enough effort into it to make Stellaris a good game. A game like ""Europa Universalis IV"" in space? Sounded too good.In terms of game mechanics it feels simpler than Universalis, instead expansion is being slowed down by the sector concept and minimalistic management of colonies.But the gameplay isn't my main critique, it's the presentation!Stellaris gets 3/10 points when it comes to graphics, and those 3 points are only for the nice galaxy map and the creative alien races, although there could have been done a lot more with their animations instead of just blinking eyes and wobbling heads.Fleet battles? I gave up watching that chaotic mess. You just wait for the results.Another few ugly examples:When I win a war in this game a text message says ""You have won a war"". That's basically all.When I change the weapons on my ship models, different weapons use the same 3D model.When I upgrade buildings (and I did that a lot), sometimes all that changes in the tiny grapics representing the building is the colour and a number.When I discover planets of ""natural beauty"" (special bonus planets), they just have the same background graphics that other planets have too.All these and other failures make the game boring quickly. And again, the presentation! It's 2016, not 1995! Oh, and don't even think I'll buy a single DLC for this one! Plantoids? More like ""greedoids""!Sincerely,Air Berzerk			"

												It's a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of fun, until you realise the bland pattern which the game follows:Stellaris; 1,2,3.1. Stack a big fleet and♥♥♥♥♥♥on your enemy, land troops.2. Integrate the inhabitants of the worlds you conquered into your own empire3. RepeatNot a whole lot changes, the fleets just get bigger and you constantly need to make more energy credits for your ship maintenance. You're lucky if you find some good anomalies to humor you along the way.The game is very bland,  it really needs more small things to amuse you along the dull ride of galactic conquering.Not to mention the shoddy GUI and moronic A.I, which can both be fixed by modding.

												The game for sure has promise for the future, but as of right now it is extremely lacking. The UI is bad. The AI Empires are stupid, the sector AI is totally messed up and hurts more than helps. Nearing the mid/end game there is a massive drop off of features, for example I am currently 170 years into a game and it is safe to say nothing of note has happened in the past one hundred years, I've spent more time on my phone in these past 100 years than playing the game. However the first fifty years or so were pretty good. Also you can be sure that Paradox is probably going to nickel and dime you for the DLCs that will actually make the late game playable			"

												Whether you're just exploring the galaxy, forming alliances and embassies to achieve galactic peace, or fighting those damn commies, there is no doubt that this game is fun no matter your playstyle. Research new technology to gather an advantage over your enemies, conquer entire solar systems to increase your power, enslave other species\' for your personal benefit, exploit other empire's for their resources, or unite the galaxy to fight off a force that will destroy everything you have worked for. Stellaris is an incredible game that will get better with time and DLC. There is also a lot of fun to have when playing against other player online aswell. 8/10 Still some bugs to be fixed and features that would be neat to see, but those will probably be added in the future.

												At the moment, I do not recommend this game. It is a fantastic start to a great 4X game, one that definitely plays to my love of Star Trek and exploring the unknown and meeting new races and all... But they have yet to actually give the game any guts. The diplomacy is laughable, the espionage is nonexistent, the trading system has yet to be implemented, and the AI doesn't understand basic fleet management. It is much better put to together than most 4X's upon release, and I understand Paradox is infamous for selling their patches via DLC, but at the moment, I wish I could go back in time and tell myself of several weeks ago to save his money for groceries. I'll probably update this review in about a year, when the game is more playable, but for now... I'm getting addicted to an empty promise of a good time, and it's dissappointing in more than one way.			"

It is almost as bad as working at a call center (you push through it hoping things will get better)-End game is barely better -Bare bones technology tree that doesnt end up feeling fun or diverse (or lend to differing strategies)-Lacks fun events like CK2 or even Eu4. -Worlds feel generic with few notable exceptions.-No production syste, (spaceports all produce ships at the same speed)I worry paradox has shifted to a model that thinks it is ok to launch a poor product because they can make it 'better' with insanely priced DLC.

												I'll assume that you've already read the popular negative reviews as I write this, so I will reference those critiques as I have relatively few of my own.You may have noticed a trend in those negative reviews.  Something like ""I realized after 50 hours of play, I was bored.""The question right now is not whether or not this is a good game.  The question is whether you're willing to spend 40 dollars for ~50 hours of generally strong gameplay.  If this were any other dev, the answer would be a resounding ""yes"" from the community, but many have fallen into the trap of comparing Stellaris to it's more mature siblings instead of reviewing it as an induvidual game.  Will this game be better in a year than it is now, most certainly.  Is this game deserving of a negative review, absolutely not.  The negative reviews are reviewing this game with a benchmark, but from a level perspective, it is an excellent purchase for the pricetag that will only get better as time goes on.			"

												Stellaris is initially quite engaging, but doesn't go anywhere with the initial momentum.The main problem is the game is just entirely too slow. Now you may say to yourself ""Aren't most Paradox games slow?"" and you would be right. But not quite this level. Mid-game you'll probably be on fastest speed while alt-tabbed or maybe reading a book. It takes entirely too long to research any technologies (thank you based tech costs scaling up with your population and planet count). Very little of note happens for long stretches of time. Except the AI spamming you with inconsequential offers for the 5000th time.The other major issue is that combat devolves into massive fleet vs massive fleet. Does your massive fleet have slightly less strength than the enemy fleet? Then prepare to lose all your ships while only doing 5-10% of the enemies fleet's damage in return. It's extremely anticlimatic to play the game for a long time, only to have the entire your entire fleet crushed and have little recourse. Other Paradox games also encourage blobbing to a degree, but at least they have attrition. There's no attrition in space. The other annoying thing is your ships suck up enormous amounts of power if they're not orbit of a world your control. So you have to do your absolute best to build a fleet capable of beating your enemy but don't use too much energy, or your entire society collapses due to ineffeciency.  ""Please sir, may I have another energy credit so I can wage war without getting annhilated by the xenos who fanatically hate me.""I can't believe I wasted 18 hours of my time on this.			"

												When I first got this game right after it's release I thought that it was decent for an unfinished game and it could be good after the developers implement the missing basic functioality. Coming back 9 months later I see that the game has been left as it was during the release.So what is missing - all the automations that take the micromanagement away from you so that you can enjoy of the other aspects of the game. Instead your time is completely consumed by pointless micromanagement tasksI do not recommend this game - it's just boring and it looks like it will not be fixed.			"

												Whilst full of bugs, this is a stellar game.  I was RPing halo's UNSC, colonised 1/4 of the galaxy (large map size), and all of a sudden, I get this message with some dude calling me an insect.  The next thing I know, this guy who looks like a salamander with arms is demanding I abandon 18 planets, including my home world.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to that I thought, so I told him to do one.  Oops.  Turns out this empire has ring worlds, is really powerful and has the ability to appear in my system in an instant.  Cue 5 hour guerilla war, baiting one his overwhelmingly powerful fleets into my federations combined forces of around 25k, whilst at the same time retaking the planets they invaded by hiding in other systems.I can only imagine this game getting better with more updates/patches/fixes/DLC/mods.  My main gripe is the performance mid to late game.  Would recommend.Edit:  This game is now on its 3rd major patch, there are things like sector AI that are still not working very well, however, that's only a small part of a very large game.  The Leviathans DLC has been excellent so far.  Personal highlight being the Enegmatic Fortress quest chain.  Frustrating doesn't come close.			"

												I played this game a little bit now. The start was fun, but it became a grind really quickly. The management part seems to scale pretty badly with the empire size. The UI becomes rather clunky too. There are no lists of colonizable planets and no lists of shipyards. Controlling your science and construction ships becomes chore, with no decisionmaking involved what sovever. In battles tactics aren't involved aswell. Thats somewhat in the tradition of paradox games. But that doesn't cut it for me in a space title. I want awesome space battles ...I played one game for 8 hours now, and i dont feel like i made any intresting choices. Compared to EU or Crusader Kings the game seems to be pretty plain. I don't feel like there is any reason to go back to it. I would have expected more from paradox and that they learned some more lessons from titles like Distant Worlds. If something the player has to do can be easily automated and does not involve decisionmaking, he shouldn't have to do it in the first place. At least in a 4x titel...			"

												I am writing this with a splitting headache brought on by my utter disillisionment with this. I am a paradox fan - EUIV HOIIII for several hundred hours so I dont shy from a challenge. Im glad this is a huge commercial success for Paradox, so they should be able to put things right. I have found a number of flaws - things I dont  like as have we all. Aprt from that I am in awe of the scope of the game, and like many of us have given Paradox too much of a pass till now. The Game breaker for me is Influence, it is used to buy leaders, outposts, etc and not initially mentioned - tier two planet improvements.  In my current game it has a myriad of uses and I am currently getting 1 stinking point a month, and outpost costs 100 pointsI hope I am wrong about this but I dont think so. It seems to me a solution would be to remove inflence costs for at least some thingsThis isnt the first time Paradox have done something like this - HOIIII has a very complex logistics system that seems to be a complete clusterf*ck. The only way I can manage it is the sandox mode that disables logistics. Maybe a mod can do something for stellaris  Maybe Im just stupid I wonder though how all the people writing the glowing reviews have not noticed this. I was going to preorder HOIIV when it comes avail - Once bitten twice shy. I give Stellaris another try when I hear of some serious changesMy advice - wait - I wish itr success - I think we will be rewarded			"

												Stellaris is more than just a 4x game, its also more than just a grand strategy game. it’s a game about creating stories and it does it exceedingly well.My first serious playthrough I was leading an empire of weak (recently psychic) bug aliens on their slow expansion across the vastness of space, my enemies the evil mushrooms and their avian lapdogs had carved a deep chunk out of my borders quickly overcoming my hilarously inadequate defences before being beaten back by my hastily scavenged together fleet headed by an ancient salvaged cruiser I had pressed back into service.I was desperate, no one wanted to help my beleaguered empire and my galactic neighbours all sat there waiting to carve up my territory once my enemies finished me off.Salvation came from an unlikely source. A world of primitives on the very edge of my territory were impressive warriors, they were backwards and horribly violent caught up in a global conflict and just starting to harness the power of the atom but they would make excellent cannon fodder to throw against my slimy foes.So I infiltrated this unremarkable world, an insignificant planet in the Sol system the locals called Earth and began preparing them for subjugation. Time ground past slowly with my beleaguered fleet holding even but my inept ground troops unable to make any headway on retaking my planets. My gains were slow but steady,  I had a brief moment of terror when my infiltration was almost discovered but finally the human race bowed down in welcome of their liberators who had lifted them from barbarism… and enslaved the entire race of weird mammals five minutes after the cheering died down.That little story is stellaris in a nutshell and its only one of an infinite number of stories the game helps you to create.Its not perfect, it slows in the mid game and it could do with a few tweaks and fixes but what game doesn’t these days? Stellaris is designed to be modded altered and changed to the desires of its players, if you don’t like something not only does the company support you fixing it to your liking they will be more than happy to show you how.I look forward to added content as the game evolves, both from the developers and the fanbase, I have a feeling Stellaris will be telling me new stories for years to come.

												ENG:Im not usual play much strategy games but, when I find good one, i really recommend this one for sure.This is aboslute the best Paradox product ever and the game, which im played! Even so far, this is the best space strategy game what im played! One very big reason why I recommend the game is the game's modding support. The only thing of which i can mention the downside is the game's high difficulty level. But if it is not the level of difficulty of the game, so it's an unfair game, the game balance.Within moments of the game opponents or AI evolves the technology level so quickly that, the player can not keep up with it any more and the player loses the battle because of this due to the lack of technology, not even the easiest difficulty level of the game level. (Normal difficulty level because, easy difficulty level does not exist.)Nonetheless, the game has a good user interface and the game is easy to learn.High recommendation! C:FIN:Minä en yleensä paljoa pelaile strategia pelejä mutta, kun sellaisen lyödän niin, kyllä minä suosittelen ja ilmaisen tämän.Tämän on ehdottomasti paras Paradox tuote ja peli ikinä, jota olen pelannut! Sekä myös jopa paras avaruus strategia peli jota itse pelannut tähän asti! Yksi erittäin suuri syy miksi suosittelen peliä on pelin modaus tuki. Ainut asia josta voin huonona puolena mainita on pelin korkea vaikeustaso. Mutta jos se ei ole pelin vaikeustaso niin se on pelin epäreilu peli tasapaino.Muutamassa hetkessä pelin vastustajat tai tekoäly kehittyy teknologia tasolla niin, nopeasti että, pelaaja ei pysy enään sen mukana ja pelaaja häviää taistelut tämän vuoksi puutteellisen teknologian vuoksi,ei edes pelin helpoimmalla vaikeustasolla tasolla. (Normaali vaikeustaso, koska helppoa vaikeustasoa ei ole.)Kaikesta huolimatta pelissä on hyvä käyttöliittymä ja pelin on helppo oppia.Korkeat suositteluni! :3			"

												This is the first Grand Strategy game of PDS's works that I've picked up, and the first of the genre including Master of Orion, Sins of a Solar Empire, and such.  I've always been interested in the 4x space genre, but I've never really been able to get my foot in the door.  The problem was always the sea of information you inevitably start drowning in without getting your feet wet with fan tutorials (looking at you CK2, and EU4) or some such.Stellaris breaks this trend.This game serves as the perfect gateway game into these, and it doesn't even have to be that way--Stellaris itself has enouch charm and depth to keep you around, especially knowing that it will be supported in the time to come.  If space isn't your thing, then sure this is an excellent way to be introduced to the genre, but otherwise you can do away with your hesitation from intimidation.The in game tutorial is integrated into the main game and helps you understand how to look at a star system and decide what's important and what you need to do.  It's not step by step, however: your helpful AI gives you a list of tasks that are recommended to be finished for a fledgling galactic civilization, and within this list it tells you how to do it and why it's important.  It's up to you when and where you want to do each thing, or if you want to at all, but in general it points you in the right direction.It isn't flawless, however, as the deeper you dive, the more options you'll encounter, and the more options you encounter the more likely you'll feel like you're drowning.  I've personally never had that feeling and I honestly do think the game does a good job of easing you in, but it's definitely probable that some players will become overwhelmed.There's something else that isn't talked about too much, but can clearly be seen from reading other reviews.  Stellaris and other games by PDS showcase their grand strategy by the expanse of their setting.  In this case, you're another civilization among other aliens across the galaxy.  The game truly shines if you're seeking a narrative or if you wish to roleplay.  The game offers plenty for both those who want to efficiently dominate (through peace OR war), or those who want to create a story.I haven't played it long enough to find out how it holds up in the mid/late to late stages of the game, but I imagine the management across star systems is terrifying.  Not everything is explained very thoroughly, either, and either trial and error or the community will have to pull through for you (for now at least).  I've heard complaints that the UI isn't very good, but I found it delightful both aesthetically and functionally.  There are truthfully some bugs to be ironed out, but it's only the third day or so and many major ones have already been dealt with, proving PDS's support.Stellaris offers plenty for everyone, and its accessibility is seriously impressive considering its scope.  This is all from single player experience, by the way, I can't wait to see how exciting multiplayer is.  The strategic management from planetary troops, to space stations, resources across solar systems, and fleets across galaxies is both intimidating and amazing.  The experiences you come across from this is something other games can't touch.I recommend without a doubt.  If you're on the fence because you're afraid you won't be able to grasp it, I'd say give it a try.  If you don't spend two hours creating your own alien empire you can still refund it during the tutorial.			"

												Only played a couple of games so far and it's a huge game. Not for the casual gamer but for the gamer who likes civilization games or the like as it takes over your life when you play it.Definitely worth the price it comes at. I'd just love to have some more scenarios like in Civ, rather than the sins of a solar empire gameplay where it's just a repeat of the same over and over again with little changes depending on which race you pic. It's always improving though so definitely give it a change as you are getting you're getting your money's worth.			"

												Loved it so far. A bunch of my friends have really been waiting for this, and we were so hyped up for the release today. Apart from one stutter glitch, I was really surprised at how *not* buggy this game was from release. These days, it seems most games come out on release with a plethora of game breaking bugs, or a few that ruin it for a lot. But not this game. I give a full recommendation, however I will admit there is a learning curve and if you don't do your research or let the game give you the full tutorial, you will get stuck! This is not a game to be felt out without help! I jumped right into a multiplayer with my friends, and even then it was hard.A few tibits extra about the game I liked:-Music is beautiful-Graphics are pretty and nice to look at-UI is *not* disgusting, it just is not for the faint of heart.-Races are creative, well drawn, and look cool-Quite a lot of techs and facets to exploreGreat day-one gameplay for me personally. Can't wait for the Star Wars, 40K, and Mass Effect Mods. I know they're coming!			"

												I have played many strategy games in my time. And if there was ever a well made space strategy, grand strategy, where almost ANYTHING can happen. This would be it. And I totally reccomend this game to anyone who loves Sci-Fi and Strategy. This game is Civ meets Sins Of A Solar Empire and an amazing part is that the developer knows how amazing their game is so they are still constructing things tweaking things and making it better with stellar (pun intended) content.There are problems when it comes to giant scenarios or large fleet battles. Ship battles get very cluttered and infantry batles don't make sense, especially if you have the clear advantage and still manage to lose the battle.Sometimes the game lags drastically especially in the large maps. I definitly reccomend having a high-mid grade PC build just to get the best out of the game.But all in all this game is complex underneath and it surprises me almost every time. Throw mods in the mix and things go to♥♥♥♥♥♥real quick.Fun game to pass time or to dive into. I tottally reccomend it			"

												Got the game on a whim, having never played many ""Grand strategy"" or ""4X"" games.  To be honest I wasn't sure what those tags even defined prior to playing this.  This game is sweet.  If you like in-depth strategy games this is a fine one.  The biggest Pro for me?  It was easy to get into even though I have played only ""casual"" strategy games such as Civ 5 and more RTS style games such as starcraft.  I felt overwhelmed only for a few moments when things began happening, but as long as you read / listen to the helpful robot you will get the hang of it quickly.It is worth noting there is a LOT to do in this game but the majority of it is entertaining and none of it felt completely like a chore.  If you do not take interest in building each little planet hand-by-hand you can even set it inside of a zone that takes care of it for you (at least after the first few hours when the tutorial takes you there).Replay-ability will of course be massive as there is so much random generation each game will always be different.Looking forward to dying of the space plague sometime in the near future of my first play through.

												Highly addictive space strategy game, with a huge modding community to flush out the game and shape the universe you want to play in! Start the campaing as the Galatic Empire in a civil war against the republic, Join Master Cheif and Cortana in their quest togheter with the UNSC to eliminate the invading covneant forces. But what if the empire would fight the federation of stargate being puppeted by the covenant ? Fully possible as u can mix a bunch of franchies and create the universe you want to live in and fight for. Remake one of your favorite sci-fi factions with mods or create an entirely new and unique one from ground up. Play with friends and form federations to united reseach, explore and fight the terrors of the deep space. Fight mighty space dragons, fallen empires, overwhelming empieres. Influence the galaxy and keep the peace, or throw it in to a chaotic total war. Playing on your own and forming your own story is cool and fun. However COOP for me is the most important aspect. To be able to play with a bunch of friends and form a federation to conquer the galaxy is just amazing. Form a federation, unite your forces and togheter come out on top as the new galatic empire, or fall flat on some of the overwhelming aliens. If you enjoy coop, sci-fi, rts, 4k and space overall and you have plenty of time ready to invest into creating you own story then this is the game for you.			"

												After a few hours of playing this game and exploring the game mechanics, I found myself lost and before I knew it, those few hours had just flown by. The attention to detail in this game is rich and full of promise with throwing me back to memories of Sins of a Solar Empire with the empire construction and ship movement from system to system. Then we have the battles which give similar good times and are quite indepth if you need to defend multiple systems at a time, not lacking in tactical moves you could pull on an unsuspecting adversary.Pros for me:- Empire building is very well put together and I like the way a player can see just about anything they could want and change the little details for improvements- Combat is excellent and gave me a challenge to hold off pirates, rouge aliens and other empires. Not clunky or full of complexity and simple to master once you have the basics down of how the game runs.- The diplomacy and number of alien races you can have in one game is mind boggling but I like the idea of studying younger races than your own and uplifting them to the stars or genetically altering them to your needs.- The size of the maps and games is immense with getting onto a 1000 star systems which I do like but multiplayer games I can see taking a long time to complete. Just how I like it. :)- Last but not least is the ship building mechanic, this is very good and I like having the freedom to create more of what I would use in combat and exploration. Can create some nice weapon combos after you've reached a while and also a world class explorer.Will continue to play but so far it has my vote!			"

												I'll be honest, I pirated this game first to see if I'd like it.Well, I liked it so much that I bought two copies, and sent the other to a friend.As a longtime fan and player of MOO2, I was not at all pleased with the latest iteration of the aforementioned game, so when I found Stellaris it was a godsend. It takes everything you want from a grand space strategy and, in most cases, gives you more.Breakdown:Pros:- Surprisingly deep roleplaying- Gorgeous UI- Pleasing variety of species- Complex diplomacy- Very strong early game- 8/8 mod support- Lots of room for DLCCons:- Too much information- HORRIBLE AI- Forced automation of planets- Boring Diplomacy- Uninteresting war- Lots of room for DLCNitty Gritty:For starters, the game forces you to play rather specifically to the personality of your race; the availability of many options, and the viability of others, will be determined by your race's beliefs. Furthermore leaders can die during battle, via dangerous research or simply from old age, and don't be surprised if you get attached to a few (especially if you made your own name-generation list). This makes the game more than about simply conquering the galaxy- you're conquering the galaxy for your empire, which is pretty different from everyone else’s.Also, the UI is nicely put together and pretty easy to grasp. The crippling confusion you feel minutes into the game will pass, and the tutorial helps somewhat. Stellaris manages to be both very accessible and yet still give us a significant amount of depth.On the not so good side, my biggest complaint is that the AI is horrendous. As in a ""dear-god-I-miss-AOE2-AI"" kind of horrendous. Your allies’ fleets will simply follows yours around, leaving their systems vulerable and their armies relatively inert, and you’ll be playing cat and mouse with your enemies during every war, as they are unwilling to engage unless victory is assured. I also might add that none of the computers seem inclined to address GALAXY WIDE THREATS. Finally the computers just… leave you alone. Seriously. I’ve yet to fight a war that I didn’t start myself.The another major complaint is that every bit of information is on display to you. How strong an enemy fleet is. Whether your federation will agree to go to war or not. If a trade proposal will be accepted. This inundation of cold, hard numbers underlying every interaction definitely take away some of the thrill and suspense of, well, everything. Because of it, I always fight battles I know I’ll win, always make the best possible trades and am never left wondering about my place in the galaxy. Once you’re done exploring and have made your mark, things can get pretty dull and systematic very fast.Both of these issues are somewhat solved by multiplayer though. Which is why I bought two copies.Finally, an issue of some controversy, is the forced automation of your colonies. Most empires can only control 5 planets at a time before they start suffering penalties until they automate their systems in ""sectors"". This is designed to keep the game from becoming a micro-managing nightmare, which is good. In fact, I love this feature. However, even as someone who really despises micromanagement in 4x games it does bother me that the game effectively forces your hand with this. So if you (for some reason) like spending the majority of the game paused while reorganizing the attributes of dozens of planets... well, you'll be disappointed.I know I have a lot of negative up there, but the truth is, it’s a fantastic game and I think everyone should play it. With updates, mods, and DLC the game will become even better, but for now it's a plenty solid game on its own. "

												If you're looking for a game similar to Sins of a Solar Empire that isn't constant warfare, then this is the game for you. While it is almost too slow since I've started up, I really like the process so far, having created 2 custom factions with the extensive creation system (friendly turtle people and libretarian bird people) and have been playing a game as the Commonwealth of Man (the evil humans). However, I only bought this game after watching about an hour and a half of gameplay on Youtube, so I suggest you reserve your judgement before buying this one.			"

												Warning: total newb to anything Paradox has ever made.  Closest games that I've played extensively are Civ 3/5 and Sins of a Solar Empire.Mostly posting a first impressions review after the first few hours of gameplay in order to offer any insight for other newbs who come from similar games.  Stellaris is a soothing, mysterious, and alive experience... something I've never felt from a game like Sins, where so much of the emphasis was placed on combat and grabbing things as fast as you could.  There's a slower pace that is most certainly intentional, with a pretty good tutorial to ease you in.Early on, the biggest challenges I faced and am still facing are learning what resources are most important, realizing what buildable objects are a drain that I didn't expect (outposts taking influence), being caught with my pants down as a faction of my people split off and started taking out my my mining structures far away from my home planet, and figuring out how fast I should expand vs. fortify.The scientific missions and anomalies you stumble across while surveying systems has been the highlight so far.  I've taken joy in reading the lovingly crafted blurbs of text that describe all kinds of alien flora and fauna, how your crew interacted with them upon encountering and discovering, and the personal touch that makes it seem like you're truly living out YOUR expanding empire through YOUR people.  To have something to do that isn't just dealing with another AI civilization or expanding for expansion's sake?  Really makes space feel more alive than one could possibly hope for.I understand why Stellaris is hard to put down once you get settled in.  So much to discover, just one more system to scan, one more hilariously terrifying description to read, and so on.  The pace is certainly slow, especially since you can pause to get your bearings as much as you please, but it's welcome as I can still feel invested in my gametime, while not feeling like I can't pause for a few minutes to get up and take a break, or tab out while all my vessels are scanning special projects and read some news.

												I highly recommend getting this game in its current state. Even with all the problems, its that good.Its a paradox game, but it doesn't feel like a pradox game, because its not buggy on release and actually works. The tutorial is super, races are interesting, basically what was a DLC for other games is included in this one already (making your own custom race), and the music and atmosphere/graphics are all solid. Customizing the ships is cool, and the space battles can be fun to watch. The pops are complex and managing them can be interesting.Problems:1. AI is terrible. The enemies really don't understand how to win a war. In a game where all the AI countries start with pretty much the same resources (like in Civ), this leads to a situation where you as the player have a massive empire and everyone else has just divided up the galaxy evenly between them.2. Fallen empires can be conquered, and all of their production facilities used by your pops. This is on top of the fact that defeating a fallen empire nets you their amazing super tech which puts your fleets light years ahead of your enemies in tech. Now, defeating them is no easy task, especially in the early/mid game, but its doable. They can't rebuild their fleets despite sitting on insane production, which makes conquering them too easy.4. As far as I can tell, there is no benefit to having a balanced fleet with screens and cruisers protecting your BBs. In fact, they will die quickly as they go ahead of your BBs and get slaughtered waiting for them to catch up. There is no penalty for having an all BB fleet, and so you just end up building as many ships with the biggest guns you can get.5. Leaders dying and science vessels having to research wreckage of your enemies gets annoying. More tasks need to be automated.6. Putting fighter/bomber units on your ships doesn't work because the ships stay in the back and don't do anything.7. The  ""zerg"" invasion is broken. It started off with a bang and fizzed quickly.8. Designing the ships is cimbersome because there's no way to sort through the weapons and armor efficiently. Knowing paradox, I'm confident they will patch these problems in the next 5 or 10 years, so I'm sure it won't be a problem by the time you buy it.			"

												this is everything i had expected, the best game released in a very long time. best space x4 since distant worlds, and not only that its best grand strategy, its merging of 2 genres works well, and it finally fixes the broken politics of past space x4 games and makes politics finally work in these type of games.im not entirely sure if it totally beats distant worlds yet..... its very very close, so close that i cant even say which is best. the population unit thing isnt as much as a issue as i even imagined it would be, they pulled that bit off well. game brings so many new things to the space x4 genre ....but the thing is..... we all know this game isnt even finished yet!we all know it will have 200 more expansions, which all will add EVEN MORE features and new ideas to the game. currently we can view the game in a basic form, its basic form is so awesome it maybe better than distant worlds universe...... but with the 200 extra exansions or so, this game will be so FAAAAR beyond distant worlds that there would be no comparing.i cant even imagine how much this will improve in future editions!and that makes it even more exciting.a must buy, totally excelent game, best release in very long time, really a must own for your library!

												What a rad game.  I've never really had the kind of patience to play a 4X game, but for some reason Stellaris got my attention.  The customization of the races, the non-linear progression of your empires development and the varied temperments of the your neighboring empires really emphasis how my play throughs can be unique. Losing my first empire was a ""Well s!*t!....Let's try that again."" kind of moment.I'm sure fans of this genre can easily pick out the mis-steps made by Stellaris, but being that this is the first game of this type to grab me and I have nothing to compare it to, nothing is standing out as a negative to me as of this writing.Can't say it enough.  An excellent game. Highly recommend it.			"

												Generally having a very positive experience out of the gate, 1 week after launch.If you generally like 4x space games, and have also enjoyed Paradox games like EU4 you'll probably find a lot to like here. The exploration is exciting, the technology and quest chains provide a lot of flavor, and the end-game scenarios have a lot of potential.1 week after launch though you may want to hold off for a few patches or the 1st DLC.  There are a number of quality of life mapmodes and tools PDX should add (roster of potentially colonizable planets, mapmodes that overlay alliances, more automated options for ships), the AI needs a moderate amount of tweaking in a number of areas, combat/wars need tweaking, the mid-game feels slow compared to the beginning/end (it's about the same as a lot of4x games though- it's more than the opening and end game are just much better), and areas of diplomacy and economics are very bare-bones at release.Stellaris has the potential to be as rewarding as EU4 or CK2 in ~6 months IMO, but you can still get a great deal of enjoyment as is.

												This is a GREAT game. I cannot say that enough. If you are a fan of MOO2, you're going to absolutely love Stellaris.One of the (many) things I love about it is how much the customization of the start options (which really aren't that many or complex) completely changes the nature of the game.A massive galaxy with a few opponents lets you focus more on research and expansion; More enemies, obviously, more strfe. Like quick and dirty ? Shrink the galaxy. Even only setting four or five opponents in a 1000 star galaxy doesn't mean you can rest on your laurels, though: An undefended empire is too tempting for even the simplest AI. Love this game!			"

												I could write a really long and detailed review, but if you want that, eXplorminate and Rock Paper Shotgun both have done fine jobs on that account. I've been following this game for quite a while and I did watch a lot of in-game footage and streams before playing (so my 5.7 hours is a bit deceptive--but of course the game just came out for the public). For me, this is the first space 4X game since MOO2 and later GalCiv2 (not 3) where I had to force myself to quit and go to bed. In short, it's brilliant. It's already amazingly fun and immersive and *knowable* at this early stage of its life. Knowing Paradox, this game is going to become a True Classic and revolutionize the genre just as eXplorminate's review says it will. I love it.			"

												As things currently stand this is both a Yes and No review tipping over into the Yes.This is not the Grand Strategy paradox players have grown familiar with. While the early game is brilliant, as the rest of the reviews show, there is a lack of depth on the Diplomacy / War side of things that makes the game feel unfinished and rushed. I suspect these things are sitting behind the DLC pay wall and will magically appear over the next year.			"

												I'm usually very critical in my reviews. I think the best I ever rated a game was 6/10 so far. Today will be a new record.Lets see:Stellaris is basically everything you ever wanted from a Master Of Orion game. Giant galaxies with up to 1000 stars, populated by numerous civilizations. I think the maximum is like 60 or so, but I didn't try it. But that's only starting civilizations, new ones can form later on. You can found federations together with other civilizations, with entirely self-declared rules. Those federations will vote a president from all the member civs from time to time which then controls most of the foreign and military policies. But it's not a simple alliance spam like in many other games. You'll find tons of civilization with which you won't even get close to an alliance, just because your own civilization's policies don't match with theirs.The constant construction of more infrastructure like mining stations, research stations a.s.o. is incredibly rewarding. Warfare is not just like conquer as much as you can, but instead you need to keep an eye on resources. Can you maintain that extra planet? Is a war worth it for that incredibly rich border system?Combine Master Of Orion with the complexity of a Paradox game (don't worry, it's not as complex as EU4, but still very in-depth) and you'll end up with Stellaris. I can already see my dump another 1000 hours of game time into this one.Current flaws, early after release include:- Some bugs with storylines. Like you can't finish a research project here and there because that probe you need to collect isn't clickable. Nothing game breaking, but annoying.- Some balancing problems. Normal difficulty is way too easy and I easily stomped everybody. My attempt on hard was exactly the opposite. Feels a bit like too much depends on the starting position at the moment, but I'm sure Paradox will tweak it quite soon.Overall: 8.5/10			"

												It plays like the guys who made Crusader Kings made a MOO or Galactic Civ game, so no big surprises there. As in CK2, there's a lot of depth and interactive option and random events and pathways for the player and the game world to take. It's a time investment, for sure, to get the interface down (though it's much, much more streamlined than CK2 and the tutorial is good) and actually playing out the games isn't the most rapid of events, even if you speed things up.It takes some of my favorite features from MOO2 and from CK2 and shoves them into one game, so I have a blast. Customizable and random alien races that you can modify and recruit into your populations are a heck of a lot of fun. I made a treaty with some otter people to allow migration between our worlds and ended up with some of their guys in my empire in my home world. These otter guys not only had some combat strength that my humans didn't have, but they prefered oceanic worlds to continental ones, so when I went to build a colony ship, I could fill it with otters if I so chose in order to better take advantage of different planets.Declaring other nations as rivals in order to build political capital that you can spend is a neat concept. There seem to be enough diplomatic options to keep things interesting, though they tend to mostly fall along the standard lines in Civ, at least in the early game. Being able to take on (or even become!) a vassal is great and allows for a lot of flexible game play that CK2 opened up.Being able to research along a few different paths at once is cool, as is being able to recruit and utilize different scientists' strengths for different projects is a neat layer. The fact that your governors, scientists, or military guys can become elected as your main leader adds a lot of flavor to the game (as does the fact that other nations swap out their leaders over time as well).Exploration is fun, as the scientific vessels can find all sorts of neat things. The quest system that evolves over time is pretty neat, especially as it ties in to your findings and the leaders who get elected. It's at least as good as Endless Legend and much better than Beyond Earth.It's involved, but for those looking for a deeper space strategy game should give this one a try.			"

												I have a spilt opinion for stellaris. When it was released it was pretty shi.t. Everything was fairly samey and the mid game was boring as hell to play through with the late game not being as great as hoped. But, it is way more fun in the 1.3 patch. More events, more A.I variety, more strategies. But then they put out dlc with the game not feeling finished. This game feels like an early access game but it was released as a finished one, which rubs me the wrong way. To sum it up, is it good? Yes, but it can be better. Should you buy it? If you're alright with the game not feeling entirely finished and alright with waiting for more patches. I don't regret buying the game too much. 30% out of 100. But if I knew about the state of the game before i bought it on day one then i would've waited. So far it seems like they want to continue working on the game, not sure for how long though. So if you want the game, the 1.3.1 patch is pretty fun on its own. Take that as you will.			"

												Pros- Enjoyable early stage gameplay- Race Creator is cool- Tech Tree is unique and interesting- Solid performance with exceptionCons- Currently considerably sterile and lacking in any great amount of content- That there grind though; but somewhat understandable I guess- Diplomacy and Subterfuge are flat- Trade doesn't really exist- The daily stuttering bug on larger maps. Only Tiny seems to work well, despite only using a maximum of 65% of my CPUWas it worth the ~$70(AUD), I dunno I'm on the fence; as with any Paradox title the bugs will be fixed and content will be added (in the form of detestable DLC) so there is room for improvement and maybe improved customer satisfaction.Gameplay is typical 4X, if you like it you like it otherwise you won't enjoy the game much. The ability to populate the world with species and cultures of your own making is great and the tech tree has been implemented in an intriguing manner.But the apparent lack of content and that damned stuttering bug is a nuisence, but the Paradox rep(s) seem adament about pushing the point that a patch is coming (bug should've been visible in testing if they used a mix of hardware from different vendors for comprehensive QA). The gem of a Paradox 4x is generally the diplomatic actions that can be used to coerce opponents in a game of skullduggery and politics. This game has the diplomatic depth of Donald Trump.Stutter bug is game breakingly annoying and occurs on all but the smallest map size, patch is incoming but this should've been caught during the quality assurance phase, but it didn't and now we wait for 1000 world map sizes. Stutterbug aside the game runs solidly.7/10 pending 8/10 once the stutter gets fixed.			"

												When had to tell a friend, ""I was so distracted by committing mass genocide and eugenics that I forgot I had meatballs in the oven,"" I realised that this was a good game.It's really fun, but slows down considerably if you let too many AIs populate your galaxy. There are several bugs, but what can you expect so soon after launch? The devs have been engaging with the community about them, which is encouraging. Solid 10/10. I got it to distract me until Overwatch, but now I might be playing this instead of Overwatch for a while.Edit: Also, the only game where I can say I'm a worse person than Hitler.			"

												Stellaris has one of the best early games I've seen in a 4X. Lots to do and tons of interesting decisions. It's let down in the mid to late game due to victory conditions. You're forced into war (or building a giant coalition) in order to win. This unfortunately eliminates a lot of the variety that makes the beginning so great, but still highly recommended to fans of the genre who aren't opposed to wars.			"

												A very nice game with many fun aspects. I recommend trying different mods from the community as that spices up the game dramatically. I personally play with 5-10 different ones that fixes smaller issues or adding extra layers to the game. Avoid the Planetoids DLC as it doesnt really affect the overall-gameplay and save the money for something else. It mainly brings in a different race, which there are quite a few of anyway (and you can make your own aswell).The multiplayer element is really cool aswell and I like how easy it is to join the game even though you havent been there from the beginning. ""Wanna join? No worries, you can just take over one of the AI."" The main problem is being unable to synchronise mods in some way or atleast see which one is missing from the hosts own game. I dont think its unfair as the mods deviate from the original game design but when its such a nice sandbox game, why not help the community abit in making the game ""their own"". It isnt a unique flaw as it is the same with Total War: Warhammer.For gamers that love to spend time building an empire while still being able to command fleets of battleships, this game is a good choice.

												So far very good.  Take a classic space colinization and make many unique twists regarding UI, gameplay, and strategy.  Love the human element of leaders that get reelected and die.  A bit overwhelming at first as usually these games are, but find it rather straight forwards once you get the hang of it.  Busy restarting worlds after about an hour each time, as I learn more.  Addictive already.If you want a quick mod, go into the C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stellaris\common\traits\00_species_traitsfile.  Change one of the traits like intelligent to cost like -20 instead of 2.  Now you can start a super race, with some extra power to counter the learning curve.  There is no easy level, just normal.  So don't feel wrong to cheat a little.			"

												What an awesome game!  I love the endless options to build your game play wants.  You can pick one of the many premade leadrs/races, make your entirely new kind or just tweak the premades to your needs and rename them and save them for later use by you or the AI.  This game is huge and offers a lot of variety.  Random events, planetary systems and other AI based events keep all the points of the game exciting.  Paradox really went the extra mile to make the UI actually helpful and i am still figuring out neat ways to run my empire.  You can make sectors within your territory and appoint a govenor to magane the systems in that territory, they wil build and develop the systems they are assigned to in ways that actually help.  You can still micromanage them if you want to or just leave them alone and expand your empire.  Having sevaral diifferent ways to travel the galaxy is a nice twist with its own challenges.  Paradox is planning DLC and i can't wait to see where they go from here but in the mean time I will have plenty of fun with what they have built so far.			"

												I was just going to test this for a while but somehow i played almost 4 hours. And i need to eat, and i need to sleep, and i need to work...My first impressions: this is a great, great game. It's not perfect, but if you like space strategy games, you need to play this.Summary: a must have for a strategy fan. I don't like scores, too subjectives, but this is at least more than 8,5 and less than 10 out of 10.Playing on: Win 7 64 SP1, i-7 4770, GTX980, 16GB RAM.Liked:-Stable, no bugs encountered, 0 problems so far.-UI is much more polished, easy and beautiful than other Paradox games (EU games, CK games)-Tutorial is fantastic, this is not Europa Universalis ""tutorials"" or ""scenario tutorial"", they have put a good work here (and it works...not like that scenario tuto from EU IV)-Graphics are really beautiful and you can zoom in and out to see your stations or ships or even a planet just as icons or with a lot of detail. If you zoom all in to a ship, it will you remember Eve Online (less details, and ofc only if you have seen that game)-Background music is nice, and some parts/songs are fantastic for a space game. I played all 4 hours with music on and i will continue to listen to it while i play, no doubt.-Galaxy is HUGE. You can select a few options here to generate, but the maximum is 1000 stars. Yes, 1000. And maybe 5 times more with mods (but no mods yet, ofc lol) 1000 stars is crazy, and also fantastic for a Marathon game!-Lot of customization options: races, planets, techs, names (you can name almost all in game, your stations, your ships, your planets and your leaders) I have seen no option for selecting the AI races in the game, maybe that option is not there.-Lots of technologies divided in 3 main branches: physics, society and engineering and you need a scientist leader for each branch. They said about 300 techs in total, that's a good amount and i'm sure they will add more in future development.-Resources and anomalies (events, more or less) to discover in the galaxy and some anomalies (events) lead you to a series of missions that you can do for some extra resources, techs and maybe more, i don't know yet.-A nice ships editor where you can create your own ships with modular components that first you need to research, obviously. You can select different ""bodies"" for the specific ship you want to create that let's you add more small weapon mounts, or more medium mounts, or more slots for services, etc. If you are creating a service ship (like a colony one) you'll want more modules to put some extras, but if you want just a big ship to do damage, then you'll want the body that has more weapon slots. Each body has different visual little details that you can observe when zooming.-I tried with 3 languages i know (more or less lol English, Spanish and French) and translations are vey good.-Addictive and fun.Disliked:-There are no report screens for the income and expenses. You can pass the mouse over resources and a popup will tell you what are you expending in total (for instance, 50 credits in stations) but there is no extensive report to see exactly where are you expending to better manage your incomes. This is a basic in every strategic game and it's strange that Stellaris don't have better reports and more info.-Apparently, you cannot create your stations like the rest of the ships. You can build one with a construction ship and then add modules for a military stations, but cannot modify scientific and mining ones.-Just 2 win options: own 40% of the systems or kill/conquer all the other races. I'm sure they will add more (with a DLC? i hope no)-Needs more visual customization for races and to distinguish one empire from other, apart of color of ships and flag icon (portraits of individuals at least). You can play againts 36 AI enemies, but there are just 6 species groups and one you have seen a molluscoid, you have seen they all. But, of course, this will come with DLC's.-This game is going to steal a lot of time from my rest.In summary, a must have for any fan of strategy. Fantastic.			"

To me THIS is how Beyond Earth should have been, and Stellaris shows that tenderloving care that this type of game needed.Some problems, typo's, bugs in quests, but nothing gamebreaking as of yet.Overall its something I've come to enjoy whenever I get the time to play, and it keeps me entertained over, and over again, because EVERY session is different than the last.

												I've got so say, I wasn't as excited for this paradox title as much as I was for Hoi4 mainly due to the fact that my mac is six years old and performance would probably be awfull in a large environment like space, but I was wrong. I'm mainly going to talk about performance since I haven't invested much time in play as I have making my empire. So let's get started.*NOTE* I play on the lowest settings on every game (I'm living the mac life).My first game was on the largets mode (1,000 stars), and performance while being inside a solar system was very good. I had about 25 to 30 frames and would only drop to 25 if I was rapidly zooming in and out. But the reason I ended this game early was the performance on the galaxy screen. It was, as expected, merely a single frame slideshow. I expected this since most other paradox game run this way on my mac so I decided to see if the performance would change on a smaller galxy setting. My second game was on the small galaxy settings (400 stars), and playing inside a solar system stade at a smooth 30 frames. When I went to the galaxy screen I was suprised to get 8 to 7 frames which is still bad but playable.In final if your on a mac dont be scared to buy this game, it is far more optimized than most paradox games and I'm happy to see how smooth its play compared to most of there older titles. Sadly if your on a mac you might have to stick with medium or small sized galaxies for performance reasons. P.s. i've never seen such a detailed tutorial			"

												ENG:Im not usual play much strategy games but, when I find good one, i really recommend this one for sure.This is aboslute the best Paradox product ever and the game, which im played! Even so far, this is the best space strategy game what im played! One very big reason why I recommend the game is the game's modding support. The only thing of which i can mention the downside is the game's high difficulty level. But if it is not the level of difficulty of the game, so it's an unfair game, the game balance.Within moments of the game opponents or AI evolves the technology level so quickly that, the player can not keep up with it any more and the player loses the battle because of this due to the lack of technology, not even the easiest difficulty level of the game level. (Normal difficulty level because, easy difficulty level does not exist.)Nonetheless, the game has a good user interface and the game is easy to learn.High recommendation! C:FIN:Minä en yleensä paljoa pelaile strategia pelejä mutta, kun sellaisen lyödän niin, kyllä minä suosittelen ja ilmaisen tämän.Tämän on ehdottomasti paras Paradox tuote ja peli ikinä, jota olen pelannut! Sekä myös jopa paras avaruus strategia peli jota itse pelannut tähän asti! Yksi erittäin suuri syy miksi suosittelen peliä on pelin modaus tuki. Ainut asia josta voin huonona puolena mainita on pelin korkea vaikeustaso. Mutta jos se ei ole pelin vaikeustaso niin se on pelin epäreilu peli tasapaino.Muutamassa hetkessä pelin vastustajat tai tekoäly kehittyy teknologia tasolla niin, nopeasti että, pelaaja ei pysy enään sen mukana ja pelaaja häviää taistelut tämän vuoksi puutteellisen teknologian vuoksi,ei edes pelin helpoimmalla vaikeustasolla tasolla. (Normaali vaikeustaso, koska helppoa vaikeustasoa ei ole.)Kaikesta huolimatta pelissä on hyvä käyttöliittymä ja pelin on helppo oppia.Korkeat suositteluni! :3			"

												If this game had where you design your engines and weapons it would be Aurora 4X. It's that good, the amount of customization is unreal. I would have to say one of the best strategy games out there so far. I don't think I could get into detail as to what all you could do and the few problems I've had so far is the chopiness during battles. However, that could just be my computer.

												Stellaris is a very fun and engaging strategy game. I love the sci fi setting and the soundtrack is excellent. It's nice to see that Paradox has finally made a game that is 'accessible' to casuals and newcomers whom have a interest in the studios strategy games.Pros- Streamlined and uncluttred UI and menus- Excellent music soundtrack- Nice customization options- Addicting gameplay- Accessible and easy to pick up for casuals and newcomersCons- Endgame takes too long. I wish the devs would add a way to finish the game early such as military or economic goals like they have in Civilization games.			"

												The UI intimidated me at first, but as the hours went by I found myself enjoying this game far more than I expected to.  It is very easy to grasp and still manages to be much deeper than most recent 4X titles.  The amount of content is insane: Robots, extragalactic invaders, aliens from a different dimension, etc.  The volume of sci-fi that Paradox has mashed into the game is just amazing.  I won't be surprised if I encounter a Tardis at some point.  And just like Crusader Kings and Europa there are plenty of weird events and situations that make for great stories to tell your friends about.  All of this has led me to believe that it's a crime to give this game less than a 9/10 in its current state, and in time mods and DLC will make it even better.  The framework that Paradox has created has no limits.  Hail the Blorg!EDIT: As I predicted, DLC and updates are really starting to fill the game out.  The possibilities are limitless.			"

Not for the casual gamer but for the gamer who likes civilization games or the like as it takes over your life when you play it.Definitely worth the price it comes at. I'd just love to have some more scenarios like in Civ, rather than the sins of a solar empire gameplay where it's just a repeat of the same over and over again with little changes depending on which race you pic. It's always improving though so definitely give it a change as you are getting you're getting your money's worth.			"

I did not have to use the restroom, nor get anything to eat.  I have not been so taken with a game since Morrowind (2002).Pros: - Make your own Empire!- Make slave armies to die for your new Empire!- Mods add in Star Wars and Mass Effect music (I get Imperial March far too often.  I think the game is trying to say something)- I found Earth in a randomly generated galaxy!- Micromanaging can get tedious, but they have a feature in called 'Sectors' that allow you to place planets and systems into a sector so that you don't have to worry about them!Cons:- It's easy to be boxed in by bigger, stronger, more advanced aliens.- It's easy to lose because of bigger, stronger, more advanced aliens.This is easily the best game that Paradox has made and I've played several of their games.

												Paradox is a top developer for strategy games, Europa Universalis and Crusader Kings are top games.This is their first try for a complete space strategy game, and for now is a very good attempt.Nice and clear graphic, deep game with a lot of choices.You can create your own race, selecting traits, homeworld, ship type and FTL technology and etc.The galaxy is big and can be HUGE.The first part is like a 4x game but slighty slower and with more details.After the first part the game shows all his potential, economy, politic and diplomacy on galaxy level and with the complexity of games like EU.If u like Europa Universalis and Crusader Kings, you will love this one.If u like hard and deep 4x, you will love this one.If u want some good space strategy game, you will love this one.I'll write another review later but finally a Paradox game in SPACE This game deserves the nomination for the price ""5 more minutes"" becouse you don't want to stop playing even if it's late night or early morning :)			"

												This has very quickly become my favorite 4x of all time. Most know how 4x works, so I'll just highlight what puts this on top for me. The only game that comes close to giving you that feeling of a immersive story in the 4x genre is Civ5 and that's partly down to the historical familiarity; this game achieves that without it and arguably better. They really have made the eXplore side of the game very intriguing, simply sending out a science vessal (scout) to each and every system you can, sounds labourious but it has you hanging with speculation and excitement. The diplomacy side of the game is unparrelled in the space 4x and it really is a welcome level of complexity brought in from their experience with their Europa series. I didn't think I'd like the realtime aspect as much as I do but it really fits well with this game, and I'm really looking forward to trying this out multiplayer because of it. Paradox being Paradox, we know their will be a wealth of DLC, and as much as many may hate that aspect, I'm personally really looking forward to it becuase there is so much growth potential in an already content rich game. If you love the 4x genre, you'll love this.			"

												TL;DR: Very solid 4X. The UI is really clean, even though there is a lot going on. Shortcuts for almost all screens and actions. Unbelievable number of bugs, but no game breakers.Update: The team has gone back and cleaned up a huge number of bugs. I've reached mid game without encountering a single one, and the bugs I've seen are minor. I'll do a proper update once I've finished a complete game, as I expect most of the remaining bugs will be in the end-game.Original review written at 60 hours. Edited at 140 hours. Updated at 260 hours.The good:Nice expansive scope and high polish. You can uplift species to give them sentience; you can enlighten already-sentient aliens that haven't hit the FTL stage; the diplomacy feels very above-average to me, though it's not something I tend to pay much attention to unless something bugs me; and there are stagnant empires of high-tech aliens that came before you. That makes the universe feel very lived-in, which is very nice. The tech trees are pretty deep, and semi-random for replayability. The race/empire creation has a lot of choices. The fun factor is high - I've got about 140 hours in at the time of this writing.The bad:Ludicrous numbers of bugs. I started keeping a notepad near my keyboard to jot down bugs I found. I gave up when I had to start a second page. From a QA point of view, the game is a hot mess. That being said, however, none of the bugs are game breaking. I have never had to restart because of a bug. The closest I came was an ironman game that lost 50 years of progress (so I don't play ironman anymore; I just manually choose not to save scum). That may mean more to you if you're a cheevo hunter, since you only unlock achievements when playing ironman.Conclusion:I really love this game. It's apparent that a lot of thought went into designing how the systems would work and fit together with each other. It's pretty obvious that the development was rushed and a lot of QA got dropped, but nowadays that's not as big an issue as it was back pre-internet. I would imagine their desire to sell DLC will prompt them to go back and finish the job. After all, I'm not very likely to buy DLC if the base product isn't finished. Even at 90% complete, however, the game is a gem :o)			"

Right now it feels like I can just drop an embassy on them and walk away, even if we are diometrically opposed in ideologies.At first I found the UI to be horriblly clunky, after an hour or two that was a non-issue.  There's definitely a few things to brush up on there (not de-selecting my ship when I left click to cancel a right click order for one.)Is this a better game than the new MOO?

												Updated after 40+ hours of gameplay.In short: Stellaris is an engaging and hugely promising 4X game. It's a blast to play, and does a masterful job at combining 4X and Paradox-style grand strategy. Patches and DLCs will only make it better.=== The good ===Graphics and artwork are great, and the music is simply wonderful. They both set the mood so well, along with all the ""plot events"" related to anomalies your research ships discover and various random events like the ones you find in EU, HOI, and CK. Exploration gameplay consists mainly of assigning scientists to research projects and science ships and using them to explore the galaxy and unlock new techs. The random nature of both anomalies, story events, and technologies sets an atmosphere of exploration and disocvery, and you really feel like you're a species setting off to brave the cosmos. There is great variation and creativity in the techs and story events, too. I also love how there are three means of travelling between systems and that you have to pick one and stick with it for the whole game. The way you decide on policies, ethics and government types for your species reminds me of other Paradox games, and helps make the various speces feel diverse and immersing while also having a significant impact on what you can and cannot do in-game, increasing replayability value.You also manage your ""pops"" and buildings on planets, and use a Stars!-esque ship designer to design your ships. Battles are largelly automated, so winning them depends on good ship designs and finding a good fleet composition.It should also be noted that the game is incredibly stable, both in single-and multi-player. There's apparently a bug where your friends may not see the gamer you're hosting, but we fixed it by simply launching a hosted game for then to use Steam to send an invite directly to the person who was to join.=== The bad ===Earlier I complained about user interface and balance -- these have been improved by patches. The game still doesn't have the depth of the rest of the PDX games, but is still incredibly fun. One problem is the lack of victory conditions beyond the ones requiring conquest, however, which is a particularly big problem when playing as a pacifist species.The main problem with the game in my eyes is the lack of depth we've come to love in PDX's games. Diplomacy has been improved greatly by patches, but warfare still easily becomes a battle between stacks of doom. Also, the various species lack personality. They basically all play the same pretty much regardless of how you design them. Far from the differences between the nations in Crusader Kings II, for example.All told, however, I find this to be a *great* 4X game, and I can't wait to see what Paradox has up its sleeve for patches and DLCs!

												So I'm an avid Sins of a Solar Empire/Dawn of War/Sid Meier's Civilization player. There was barely a week where I didn't play one of those titles...until Stellaris. I can agree, the execution of the game is amazing if a little weak towards the end. If anything, there are mods in the workshop that more than make up for the fantastic if just a little spotty execution. I feel like as Paradox releases DLCs and expansions for Stellaris, it will make up for the spots in the game that were just a little lackluster.Pros:- Paradox perfected the blend of Sins of a Solar Empire with Sid Meier's Civilization- Customize practically everything. And if you can't, then you're just not using the right mods.- Sci-fi Conquesting doesn't get boring. I can't tell you just how unique every playthrough I've done has been. I haven't logged 100+ hours on Stellaris just for anything.Cons:- Sector AI could be better. There's a mod for it in the workshop but I haven't used it yet.- Fleet battles look a little messy without the Beautiful Battles mod.- Ground invasions are literally a 3-step process; 2-step if you're invading primitives (not recommended since most governments get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at you for doing so). There's a mod in development that's attempting to make it more dynamic. I seriously just want an animated screen of troops going at it or something a little more interactive maybe.- No actual population statistics yet (game refers to them simply as Pops. Think Civilization). I'm hoping a mod will come along to determine that stuff as well. Doesn't even need to be accurate, just look accurate.Overall:Yes, I agree with earlier reviewers who say that this is the rightful successor to Sins of a Solar Empire/Civilization if there was any need for a successor to begin with. Yes, the gameplay is great, but there are parts about the game that are lackluster if playing vanilla and vanilla only.I'd give it a good 8.5/10			"

												I have played two games of Stellaris at the time of this writing in a little over 60 hours.This is the most approachable Grand Strategy game Paradox has ever released.It makes a good bridge for general strategy players and a great bridge for 4X players into Grand Strategy.The game pushes the boundary on random vs scripted in it's procedural generation, but I feel that leaves it feeling fresh each time I play. I never know exactly what I'm going to get. Plenty of other items continue to appear regularly from game to game, but racial trait choices change up the decision points. Don't expect a clear overaching narrative, and bring plenty of imagination, and you'll be much happier.For example in my second game, I choose to mentally skin my cat race as the Wing Commander Kilrathi, making choices not based merely on statistical advantage, but my internal narrative. I was throughly enthralled, and quite tempted by the available modding tools to take it further with custom portraits and name lists, but have not yet dove in.The UI requires some learning curve, so make sure to take advantage of the many YouTube Let's Plays, the tutorial tips, forums, and in-game browsable wiki. But compared to Crusader Kings 2 I found the systems a breeze to navigate.The game has been well supported, with three hotfixes in the two weeks since release. A developer post has made clear where the game will be improved and timetables for both free and paid expansions.Don't expect strong narrative, easy UI, or tactical combat and you'll be happy. Bring imagination, curiousity, and a love for Grand Strategy and you'll have a great time.			"

												IF you like Civ V or Europe Universalis or Crusader Kings II.... and you like space.. Well then this game is for you,I have not had enoght time to burn in this game yet but man do I enjoy it. If you never played a Paradox game before it might be a bit of a learning curve! There is a ton of stuff to think of to get good results. But so far this game looks like its a bit less grindy compared to some other of their games. I like the things they have changes. The AI in my game are mostly angry and mean so be aware for singleplayer games. Its a wise move to massproduce war ship when you can. If I could add any minus to my review I would say its a bit slow and I personally are not in love with the factions that can appare in the colonys. They are abit enoying and I would like to see more ways to work agins them to add a sence of power to the leadership of the empire. Like spy on the leaders of the faction or debate them for instance. This maight be possible tho if your empire is of a certain type but I have not seen that yet.The game has already a modding community so in not to long I bet you will see Star Wars or Star trech mods if they are not out already! Over all, this is a great strategy game and I cant wait until I have forced some more of my friends to buy it and play with me. +The game is really filled with fun small events and choises.Great amount of animations and space aliens to play.Mod community is already making cool stuff for this game!Very good game over all.  - A time sink! This taked ages to win! Much like Civ V for instance.Have a few bugs that I have seen. But over all its not a bit deal!Many mean AI in single player holding back trade and stuff. But this depends on luck mostly. Some AI are just happy peaceloving trade lovers so not all are bad. Really good game. 8/10 on the age of 9  "

It's nice to see that Paradox has finally made a game that is 'accessible' to casuals and newcomers whom have a interest in the studios strategy games.Pros- Streamlined and uncluttred UI and menus- Excellent music soundtrack- Nice customization options- Addicting gameplay- Accessible and easy to pick up for casuals and newcomersCons- Endgame takes too long. I wish the devs would add a way to finish the game early such as military or economic goals like they have in Civilization games.			"

												I have not played other paradox Grand Strategy games.Have not playd the new master of orion but this game fills the need for good Space 4X for me and for paradox game this is very approachable for new players although some familiarity with other 4X games will help.Game is not perfect but very very good.+ Research system, lots of technologies and no fixed tech tree+ Exploration,+ Random stuff and its writing (planet full of drug addicts was not pleasent suprise)UPDATE after the DLC Story PackEven better! Playing this over Civilization 6. Mostly because prefer the Sci-Fi setting.They added much more content to the mid-game alround improved the gaming experience.			"

												This was my last game:Fueled by a strong economy and free migration policies, the Democratic Union of Humans (DUH) was the pre-eminent empire that liberated planets from the cruel and tyrranical rule of despotic rulers across the galaxy.  As other empires found that peace was better than war, they established open migration treaties to ensure harmony and cooperation between the empires.  Unfortunately, DUH attracted most of the unwanted populations from other empires and quickly became saddled with heavy social welfare programs to keep everyone happy.  Soon thereafter, the programs proved too expensive to sustain leaving DUH with unhappy and unproductive planets.  The failure cascade accelerated with the failing economy as DUH found it unable to support its military to protect its borders from opportunistic empires and quell internal rebellions for independence.  Sadly, the DUH experiment failed and the very populations that were unhappy with the freedoms they enjoyed found themselves conquered and enslaved... But at least they were happier in the end!  Or purged...Next game I am getting the collectivist trait.			"

												TL;DR: Very solid 4X. The UI is really clean, even though there is a lot going on. Shortcuts for almost all screens and actions. Unbelievable number of bugs, but no game breakers.Update: The team has gone back and cleaned up a huge number of bugs. I've reached mid game without encountering a single one, and the bugs I've seen are minor. I'll do a proper update once I've finished a complete game, as I expect most of the remaining bugs will be in the end-game.Original review written at 60 hours. Edited at 140 hours. Updated at 260 hours.The good:Nice expansive scope and high polish. You can uplift species to give them sentience; you can enlighten already-sentient aliens that haven't hit the FTL stage; the diplomacy feels very above-average to me, though it's not something I tend to pay much attention to unless something bugs me; and there are stagnant empires of high-tech aliens that came before you. That makes the universe feel very lived-in, which is very nice. The tech trees are pretty deep, and semi-random for replayability. The race/empire creation has a lot of choices. The fun factor is high - I've got about 140 hours in at the time of this writing.The bad:Ludicrous numbers of bugs. I started keeping a notepad near my keyboard to jot down bugs I found. I gave up when I had to start a second page. From a QA point of view, the game is a hot mess. That being said, however, none of the bugs are game breaking. I have never had to restart because of a bug. The closest I came was an ironman game that lost 50 years of progress (so I don't play ironman anymore; I just manually choose not to save scum). That may mean more to you if you're a cheevo hunter, since you only unlock achievements when playing ironman.Conclusion:I really love this game. It's apparent that a lot of thought went into designing how the systems would work and fit together with each other. It's pretty obvious that the development was rushed and a lot of QA got dropped, but nowadays that's not as big an issue as it was back pre-internet. I would imagine their desire to sell DLC will prompt them to go back and finish the job. After all, I'm not very likely to buy DLC if the base product isn't finished. Even at 90% complete, however, the game is a gem :o)			"

												So...I went to be last night at 3 in the morning.  I started playing just before noon.  I do not know how I played for 15 hours straight.  It didn't seem like 15 hours.  I did not have to use the restroom, nor get anything to eat.  I have not been so taken with a game since Morrowind (2002).Pros: - Make your own Empire!- Make slave armies to die for your new Empire!- Mods add in Star Wars and Mass Effect music (I get Imperial March far too often.  I think the game is trying to say something)- I found Earth in a randomly generated galaxy!- Micromanaging can get tedious, but they have a feature in called 'Sectors' that allow you to place planets and systems into a sector so that you don't have to worry about them!Cons:- It's easy to be boxed in by bigger, stronger, more advanced aliens.- It's easy to lose because of bigger, stronger, more advanced aliens.This is easily the best game that Paradox has made and I've played several of their games.

												The UI intimidated me at first, but as the hours went by I found myself enjoying this game far more than I expected to.  It is very easy to grasp and still manages to be much deeper than most recent 4X titles.  The amount of content is insane: Robots, extragalactic invaders, aliens from a different dimension, etc.  The volume of sci-fi that Paradox has mashed into the game is just amazing.  I won't be surprised if I encounter a Tardis at some point.  And just like Crusader Kings and Europa there are plenty of weird events and situations that make for great stories to tell your friends about.  All of this has led me to believe that it's a crime to give this game less than a 9/10 in its current state, and in time mods and DLC will make it even better.  The framework that Paradox has created has no limits.  Hail the Blorg!EDIT: As I predicted, DLC and updates are really starting to fill the game out.  The possibilities are limitless.			"

												As things currently stand this is both a Yes and No review tipping over into the Yes.This is not the Grand Strategy paradox players have grown familiar with. While the early game is brilliant, as the rest of the reviews show, there is a lack of depth on the Diplomacy / War side of things that makes the game feel unfinished and rushed. I suspect these things are sitting behind the DLC pay wall and will magically appear over the next year.			"

Like most of Paradox Interactive's games, such as Crusader Kings II, or Europa Universalis IV, it is very hard to master and understand if you first pick it up. Stellaris does not hold true to this expectation.I was able to understand the concepts and have fun right off the bat.In other words, I love this game.			"

												Stellaris is a great game. With just 5 hours played, at the point this review is written, I may haven´t experienced the whole range of this game, but to this point it has been an absolute blast. When you first step into the game (after creating your own race, which took me about 30 minutes), you get overwhelmed by the awesome design this game has. Feeling like the conquerer of the universe, your goal is to expand your empire, found colonies and lead wars against other empires, which can be AI or other players in the multiplayer mode. The interface is well structured and easy to handle. After some time, you might lose your orientation a bit, but with time it gets better and you get used to where to look for your ships. The contact interface with other alien species is extremtley well desinged and talking to other life, is very interesting. Coming to solutions suitable for both parties might not be easy and take some time, but in the end you´ll come to a good end. All in all I strongly recommend this game to every strategy veteran, as well as the people new to this genre. Furthermore, the soundtrack is so great, I could listen to it all day. I´d rate this game 9.5/10			"

												An interesting take on the typical 4X sci-fi genre.  However, with lacking mid-late game content, and the early content being seen again and again on each playthrough, mixed with no racial specialties and fairly bland ethos and government types, the game's feel and replayability is lacking.  And its combat is Paradox's worst yet.That said, it still brings some interesting ideas to the table that will hopefully be polished up and expanded through future patches and DLC.All in all, I would wait on purchasing this game until at least their end-of-month patch in May and June (with a third planned) and/or until DLC is released.  (I picked it up on sale for $30, which I do not regret).			"

												Probably one of the most interesting and fun games I've played. And I've barely gotten to mid-game if that even. So many possibilities for how you can play so I just keep restarting to try things out. Sure there are a few buggy things here and there, and definitely a number of things where you go ""boy I wish this was a feature"" but if you look at any other Paradox game (I've only played V2 and CK2 well after they were released) there should be a ton of DLC to add even more. Only major downside is that the UI gets kinda small on larger screens. My resolution is at 2160x1440 and I have to get pretty close to see it super well. But this just seems to be a Paradox issue. Not game breaking, but more of a quality of life problem.I'd put it more complete than Civ 5 was at release, with as much or even potential to get better later.9/10 definitely get it if you like 4X or space.

												What a rad game.  I've never really had the kind of patience to play a 4X game, but for some reason Stellaris got my attention.  The customization of the races, the non-linear progression of your empires development and the varied temperments of the your neighboring empires really emphasis how my play throughs can be unique. Losing my first empire was a ""Well s!*t!....Let's try that again."" kind of moment.I'm sure fans of this genre can easily pick out the mis-steps made by Stellaris, but being that this is the first game of this type to grab me and I have nothing to compare it to, nothing is standing out as a negative to me as of this writing.Can't say it enough.

												I'm relatively new to Paradox games, and I'll admit, I only heard of Stellaris about a month ago. Nonetheless, I bought it, took the plunge and I have to say, it's really, really good.I'm no good at in depth reviews, but it has a way of sucking you in, the scale of the galaxies, the ability to lead your race in whatever direction you want (I'm tired of grand space strategy where your only real option is combat) and the option to enslave an entire race of creatures because they've only achieved Medieval stages of life is superb.It does have some faults though. The trading is bit dull and the politics between races is a bit lame (I hardly talk to other races unless I need extra resources) It'd be awesome if Paradox or a mod expanded on that area, maybe made it closer to say CKII or something. Mixing races and family trees and stuff would cool.Over all though, well worth the purchase. Likely to get even better as Paradox inevitably release DLC packs too.			"

												I highly recommend getting this game in its current state. Even with all the problems, its that good.Its a paradox game, but it doesn't feel like a pradox game, because its not buggy on release and actually works. The tutorial is super, races are interesting, basically what was a DLC for other games is included in this one already (making your own custom race), and the music and atmosphere/graphics are all solid. Customizing the ships is cool, and the space battles can be fun to watch. The pops are complex and managing them can be interesting.Problems:1. AI is terrible. The enemies really don't understand how to win a war. In a game where all the AI countries start with pretty much the same resources (like in Civ), this leads to a situation where you as the player have a massive empire and everyone else has just divided up the galaxy evenly between them.2. Fallen empires can be conquered, and all of their production facilities used by your pops. This is on top of the fact that defeating a fallen empire nets you their amazing super tech which puts your fleets light years ahead of your enemies in tech. Now, defeating them is no easy task, especially in the early/mid game, but its doable. They can't rebuild their fleets despite sitting on insane production, which makes conquering them too easy.4. As far as I can tell, there is no benefit to having a balanced fleet with screens and cruisers protecting your BBs. In fact, they will die quickly as they go ahead of your BBs and get slaughtered waiting for them to catch up. There is no penalty for having an all BB fleet, and so you just end up building as many ships with the biggest guns you can get.5. Leaders dying and science vessels having to research wreckage of your enemies gets annoying. More tasks need to be automated.6. Putting fighter/bomber units on your ships doesn't work because the ships stay in the back and don't do anything.7. The  ""zerg"" invasion is broken. It started off with a bang and fizzed quickly.8. Designing the ships is cimbersome because there's no way to sort through the weapons and armor efficiently. Knowing paradox, I'm confident they will patch these problems in the next 5 or 10 years, so I'm sure it won't be a problem by the time you buy it.			"

												Like many of Paradox's grand strategy games (CK2, EU4), the DLC is going to make or break Stellaris. Is the base game playable? Definitely. Is the base game replayable? Maybe a couple of times.Is the effort that went into Stellaris worth $40? Yes, but the DLCs are going to have to be epic or cheap!I like lists, so here you go...Pros:-First and foremost, very unique pacing/tech ""tree"" for a space 4x. I feel this is the core of the game. If you don't like CK2 or EU4 pacing, you will hate Stellaris' pacing. I love it. More realistic!-Simple yet interesting custom species.-Simple galaxy creation; decent variety.-Optional sagnant advance-technolgy AI starts.-Quirky variety of FTL travel.-No spearate scout ship class! (Yes, this is a pro! Just send a corvette!)-Empire AND planetary AND researchable Edicts!-Advanced government types (although could use fleshing out).-Robots, Droids, and Sentients! Oh my!-Simple spaceport customization (but could use more module options).-Simple, interesting ship designer, with Auto-Best!-Quick load times. Not overly demanding on system resources.Neutral:-Graphics. Paradox always does enough to make graphics interesting but never fantastic.-Species can only colinize one type of planet at start. IRL, atmospheric chemistry is more important than biome, and arguably, for example, humanoids could colonize all of the biomes at start, especially assuming habitats would be available in 2200. Planet colonization limitations needs be fleshed out. I understand why they did it this way (simplicity), but it's still dull.-Bombardment is awkwardly done, but whatever (see also: ""armies/transports are lame"" below).-Government, Budget, and Demographics tabs are interesting but currently mostly useless.-The species tab gets lost in the mix, but it can be especially important after Gene Tailoring. The tab gets cumbersome with high populations/planets.-Fleet upgrading takes a long time, but just split the fleet and use different space stations, I guess. Maybe add a refueler/repair/upgrade base or more impactful modules.-Dull vassalization system. Also, shouldn't uplifted species be integrated immediately?-Needs many more non-science event chains. (See also: ""factions are lame"" below.)-Fedarations are dull. I smell a DLC there.Cons/Bugs:-Semi-useless tutorial. Clicking-through does as much. Complex UI, so multiple click-throughs needed to get scope of tabs. Easy to forget ""things I can do.""-Species traits need more impact on gameplay.-Can feel slow;  not enough to do, especially early. ""Fastest"" isn't very fast.-Conversely, there is no auto-scout option.-Most Alerts are pointless. Only Hostile Empire Fleet, Survey, and Research Alerts are meaningful.-Situation log needs ability to ""track all.""-Other Empires are ridiculously adverse to trading you anything, even when you can crush them without thought, at which point negotiation is pointless.-When maxing out on resource storage, improving storage, using them, or distributing them (to sectors) is annoying.-Army management UI is awful. Transports are lame.-Policies tab is confusing to navigate and a policy's detailed effects are difficult to predict.-Too slavery-focused, and not enough pros to slavery.-Needs more ethics divergence and faction interference/rebellion.-Scientist deaths are particularly annoying; needs option to auto-hire and auto-assign to best job.-Control over Sectors needs to be slightly greater (observation posts, option to take energy but not minerals, etc).-I can uplift pre-sentients and advance post-neolithics, but can't do anything to those in between? WTF.-The AI is moderately dumb. AI will not put up multiple fronts. They go straight for your homeworld almost always. They capitulate on relatively even-footing relatively quickly. When weak, they pull ships from defensible positions to attack. Etc, etc, etc.-Inability to re-negotiate peace conditions.-Stagnant Empires need to be less stagnant. They need SOME initiative, such as peace keeping or science regression or desire for transience or religious fanatacism or....-Needs more achievements (these are sure to come).-Needs more victory conditions (coming soon surely; ought to be part of free DLC).Note: I have not played multiplayer.TL;DR: Despite the length of my Cons/Bugs, Paradox does more good than evil; if you like 4x's, buy this game.

												Stellaris succesfully delivers in depth strategy whilst promosing a unique experience in every game. Like all Paradox Interactive games, the mechanics present challenging and fun features that open up so many possibilities and customise the game around your interests and desires. Ive been a fan of games like Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis for some time and have always been a fan of 4x sci fi games. The only constructive feedback I have is that the game could include more in-depth features like in EU4, and perhaps more customisation with how your empire expands/matures. However, Im sure features like this will be included through patches, DLC's and expansions. Also, the game would benefit if additional features were added to the UI, for example, different ways of seeing the world; similar to EU4's different map modes.For me, Stellaris is a merging of classic Paradox Games with games like Sins of a Solar Empire and board games like Eclipse. Be warned, you will spend all your time building and expanding your empire. When the day finally comes when you have won, you can start all over again with a different empire and different maps, along with overhaul mods, DLC's and expansions.Overall, Stellaris is a fantastic game which always delivers a unique experience. I highly recommend it.			"

												Generally having a very positive experience out of the gate, 1 week after launch.If you generally like 4x space games, and have also enjoyed Paradox games like EU4 you'll probably find a lot to like here. The exploration is exciting, the technology and quest chains provide a lot of flavor, and the end-game scenarios have a lot of potential.1 week after launch though you may want to hold off for a few patches or the 1st DLC.  There are a number of quality of life mapmodes and tools PDX should add (roster of potentially colonizable planets, mapmodes that overlay alliances, more automated options for ships), the AI needs a moderate amount of tweaking in a number of areas, combat/wars need tweaking, the mid-game feels slow compared to the beginning/end (it's about the same as a lot of4x games though- it's more than the opening and end game are just much better), and areas of diplomacy and economics are very bare-bones at release.Stellaris has the potential to be as rewarding as EU4 or CK2 in ~6 months IMO, but you can still get a great deal of enjoyment as is.

												If I had to sum up Stellaris in one word, it would be ""Epic"". This is Paradox grand strategy mixed with traditional 4X, mixed again with the story elements of Alpha Centauri, with a little randomness thrown in for good measure. If you found Gal Civ 3 to be lacking in some way, or maybe just a little too shallow, you should definitely give Stellaris a shot. If you're hesitating because you've tried Crusader Kings or EU in the past and found the learning curve to be too steep to get into things, you should know that Paradox has done a much better job crafting tutorials and ""special project"" missions to help guide you in. All in all, I strongly recommend giving Stellaris a try if you're a fan of the genre.			"

If you are a fan of MOO2, you're going to absolutely love Stellaris.One of the (many) things I love about it is how much the customization of the start options (which really aren't that many or complex) completely changes the nature of the game.A massive galaxy with a few opponents lets you focus more on research and expansion; More enemies, obviously, more strfe. Like quick and dirty ? Shrink the galaxy. Even only setting four or five opponents in a 1000 star galaxy doesn't mean you can rest on your laurels, though: An undefended empire is too tempting for even the simplest AI. Love this game!			"

												As things currently stand this is both a Yes and No review tipping over into the Yes.This is not the Grand Strategy paradox players have grown familiar with. While the early game is brilliant, as the rest of the reviews show, there is a lack of depth on the Diplomacy / War side of things that makes the game feel unfinished and rushed. I suspect these things are sitting behind the DLC pay wall and will magically appear over the next year.			"

												The start of the game is great, as you explore space and build up your empire. You start trading with other races and soon you're surrounded by other stellar empires. In a normal game there's usually at least a couple of hours until this point. After this, the pace slows down - not as many anomalies to discover, managing your planets gets easier with the game forcing your planets into sectors that can't be directly controlled - and this is where you'd expect the diplomacy to take over. Only it doesn't. The diplomacy is very lackluster and shallow, and the AI rarely does much unexpectedly. There's also a lot of bugs, and the endgame crises are hard to manage if you're anything but a militaristic empire, because of the dumb AI. Multiplayer comes with its own bugs and issues, but it improves the diplomacy experience because you actually interact with your federation, enemies and trading partners. That's why I as of writing this have 37 hours played, of which roughly 1/3 to half is in multiplayer. Despite its flaws I've had lots of fun with this game, and it certainly has a lot of potential. That's why I recommend it, given that you know what you get - a fun game that doesn't go quite all the way.			"

												Paradox delivers again. Stellaris is a combination of Crusader Kings II, Europa Universalis IV, Master of Orion, and Star Ruler 2. It's put together extremely well. However, as with all of Paradox's Grand Strategy games, it does take time to get into. These kinds of games are not intended to be action-packed. They're more like a game of Chess.			"

												For a first impression it is a very nice grand strategy game set in space. The pace can be adjusted to your own needs and paused at any time aswell.The races are diverse and you can easily create your own, with its own planettype, shiptype, ship looks and behaviour.Planet development and research reminded me somewhat of Civ5, so  you have a general idea how it works. Build something and put a worker on it, tile improvements and synergy etc.AND it has MULTIPLAYER :)All in all a decent game for a decent price.			"

Stellaris does not hold true to this expectation.I was able to understand the concepts and have fun right off the bat.In other words, I love this game.			"

												Stellaris is a great game. With just 5 hours played, at the point this review is written, I may haven´t experienced the whole range of this game, but to this point it has been an absolute blast. When you first step into the game (after creating your own race, which took me about 30 minutes), you get overwhelmed by the awesome design this game has. Feeling like the conquerer of the universe, your goal is to expand your empire, found colonies and lead wars against other empires, which can be AI or other players in the multiplayer mode. The interface is well structured and easy to handle. After some time, you might lose your orientation a bit, but with time it gets better and you get used to where to look for your ships. The contact interface with other alien species is extremtley well desinged and talking to other life, is very interesting. Coming to solutions suitable for both parties might not be easy and take some time, but in the end you´ll come to a good end. All in all I strongly recommend this game to every strategy veteran, as well as the people new to this genre. Furthermore, the soundtrack is so great, I could listen to it all day. I´d rate this game 9.5/10			"

												An interesting take on the typical 4X sci-fi genre.  However, with lacking mid-late game content, and the early content being seen again and again on each playthrough, mixed with no racial specialties and fairly bland ethos and government types, the game's feel and replayability is lacking.  And its combat is Paradox's worst yet.That said, it still brings some interesting ideas to the table that will hopefully be polished up and expanded through future patches and DLC.All in all, I would wait on purchasing this game until at least their end-of-month patch in May and June (with a third planned) and/or until DLC is released.

												Incredibly good strategy gameplay and interesting, lovingly crafted lore work together to create a wonderful gameplay experience.  The strategy seems to be just the right depth to challenge without completely overwhelming you, while the Traits, Ethics and Government Type do a fantastic job of bringing your freshly forged empire to life.  Staying with the theme, the techs are all incredibly creatively colorful and the ""Random Draw"" discovery style adds a lot of flavor lore-wise, making its self a refreshing take on the standard “tried and true” tech tree, adding immensely to the replay value.  The AI empire generator seems to have a knack for making interesting and logical empires as well, being so believable you can almost feel history being written as you interact with them. 	My first Empire was composed of peaceful, knowledge loving otter-men.  They quickly came across a pre-sentient race of lizard people and, after promptly uplifting them to serve as foot soldiers, used them to solidify the empire among hostile neighbors.  Then, taking advantage of the peace, they developed into incredibly skilled genetic life-shapers, improving both themselves and all who joined their mighty empire, and I'm barely into the midgame.All in all, I cannot recommend this game enough.  It is a must buy for anyone who loves a little strategy and  longs for the stars.			"

												This is a beautiful game. The graphics and art are incredible, but there's something beyond physical beauty here. The gameplay itself captures quiet solitude and shattering revelation. This game plays like the best episodes of Star Trek, the ones that make you feel quiet and small at the end. Every time you feel big and in control, you discover something new to make you feel insignificant again.The game isn't perfect. It feels like the living project it is. It will get better over time, and some of the pacing inconsistencies and bothersome closeness of the midgame will get worked out. But this game is already responsible for two of my favorite gaming moments of the year. Spoilers ahead:1. The first time I came across an alien species. My science ship scrambled. I looked for stats or a description, or something to make me feel better. All I saw was a big scary number that was way bigger than my fleet could handle, and a big quesiton mark. And it was just sitting there, watching me, and then it disappeared. I wanted so badly to know what it was, and I was so excited to read about it when I finished that research project.2. I was in steady mid-game stride. I had met all my neighbors, formed and aliance and some rivalries. I was in control, and building at a rate that would launch me past my rivals very soon. I sent a science ship out to explore the far side of the galaxy. And it suddenly disappeared. I paused and went looking for it. The last system it was in was a star with no planets, just a giant ring around the star. No sign of my ship. I unpaused, and a transmission comes in from one very angry, xenophobic fungus. His empire was larger, more powerful, and more ancient than I could comprehend, and he didn't like me one bit. So no matter what else happens with this game, I want to thank Paradox for those two amazing moments. Those alone were worth the game price.			"

												Stellaris is a much more strategy detailed, more tactics detailed, more resource detailed game that most other space/strategy games can't even compair. I should know, I own the following games...EmpyrionEndless SkyEndless SpaceEvochron MercenaryGalactic Civilization IIIMaster Of Orion (2016)Salvation ProphecySpace EngineersStar Nomad 2Star RulerStar Wars - Empires At WarStar WolvesStar Wolves 2Star Drive 2Starpoint GeminiStarpoint Gemini 2Starpoint Gemini WarlordsStellar ImpactX RebirthYargis - Space MeleeAnd Stellaris just outplays them all.My biggest thing is that you can choose from a few hundred planets to 1000 planets to explore, servey, colonize, scan, research, and mine. You can also choose how the galaxy is shaped. Alone with all of this, you can have up to 17 enemies and choose from over 30 alien life forms to conquor the known universe.You can also choose from the pre-designed leader, or design your own and choose from a set of traits, skills, and even choose from pictures you would like your alien to look like, your planet to look like, even choose and design your own flag.Combat is pretty straight forward, aim your ships to the target and the combat is automatic, although you can choose how you want your fleets to attack. This is also true for ground combat. The only downside is that you need to have a combat leader before you can setup a squad.The only real issue you have to deal with (Although I like the idea) is that your leaders can age and grow old and finally die. This is something that is real and yet gives the game more additional strategy, so you can't just make a character and then hope for the best, you got to watch your characters as they progress through the game.Overall a great strategy game where you have to watch everything and keep up with everything that is going on. Many really cool options to choose from and plenty of action going on even in the background.			"

												An awesome experience of space exploration and exploitation that none of other 4x provided. Don't get me wrong, I've been a fan of moo/moo2 for decades and spent some hundreds of hours in gc2, and still I believe moo is the best in its genre... The thing is that stellaris is different in the most positive sense of this word. The grand strategy elements yet make you expect the depth and complexity you really want of it. The seemingly slow-paced sandbox feel of the early game is combined with the tension of getting acquainted with some nasty neighbors, and feeling the breath of those militaristic xenophobes 3 stars away from your borders makes you anxiously build military while you want to grow your planets, and science, and purge those amoebas preventing you from getting that sweet sweet gaia, and... It is something brand new in space strategy, and it is fantastic.			"

												I have only played a few hours so far but it's already one of the most impressive and vast empire building games that I've seen in the last 10 years. Just the initial race creation process demonstrates the amount of thought and attention that's gone into every aspect of the game. Even the early stages of the game avoid becoming a tedious grind through the inclusion of random events such as (in the case of my first game) a group of separatist cultists and a variety of space-born megafauna!As I play and experience more of the game I'll add to this review but as it stands I would encourage any fan of grand strategy and empire building to pick this up - when mods (and presumably the inevitable expansions) start to rollout I can see the lifespan of the game extending for years.

Then they took all the elements of a 4X Space game that are fun and threw those into the pot too. And all the small shortcomings you might typically find in their previous titles? Gone. Paradox stepped up their game with this title so much its mindblowing. A fully in-depth and well integrated tutorial?? You don't do those Paradox!A soundtrack and audio effects that suck you in and are incredibly enjoyable? You don't do those either Paradox!A polished presentation with easy to read menus and interfaces? Well... sometimes you kinda do that Paradox.But with THIS title, you've done ALL of it, and completely knocked it out of the park! All I can say is WOW.

The UI is gorgeous and fluid, incorporating obvious notes from pros and cons of prior UI methods. The tutorial is fun and actually helpful.This comes from someone who is extremely difficult to please, and tends to bounce from one game to another in an search for satisfaction - I'll be stuck on this for the next 500+ hours.My only regret is not pre-ordering the Nova or Galaxy Editions, as I was wary of being disappointed.

												So, review time. I have only played this game for 80 minutes so far, so take this as a 'first impressions' review. Starting off, it can be a little overwhelming as it is different yet also the same as most other Paradox games. At first, there is a feeling of tension as you know what will happen and you move to get yourself suited for first contact. As with any new game there is also a learning curve, but it is not very steep at all. The soundtrack is amazing and has kept me completely immersed in my space-fairing adventures. The tutorial however, while comprehensive. can be a bit annoying becuase it completely covers your list of what to do. That said the tutorial guide is quirky and can even bring out a few good chuckles. All in all from a beginners point of view, this game is great. Perhaps not a must buy for anyone unwilling to learn something new, but if you dont fall into that category then congratulations you have a potential new game in your library that can be played for hours on end!

Personally, I don't think this game disappoints at all. You have to have an appreciation for Paradox games to get it and some of those still may not. Love the soundtrack and feeling of galactic proportions this game so far seems to deliver. I actually feel like a fledgling starfaring explorer wondering what my actions may reap in the future as I start to make contacts as I explore the unkown. Love this game so far Paradox. Finally something to itch my star searching craving in a grand stratedy game where the game can be real time but not feel like Im being overwhelmed from every direction.

												Have not played a whole lot of this game yet, but so far its been very fun. The game as a whole is extremely complicated to someone knew to 4X games (like me). I have never played a 4X game or grand strategy game and it was difficult to learn the ropes at first. I had to lose an empire to get the hang of it.Once I figured the game out more my second try went much better. The game feels polished, there are no glaring glitches in the game. Be warned, if you are not interested in reading this is not the game for you! Nearly all information is given in the form of text and there are not many voice overs passed the tutorial sections. You will be presented with paragraphs to read. The tutorial system is kind of sub-par in my oppinion. Nothing is highlited during the tutorials, so some times finding where the tutorial wants you to click is difficult. There is no path for the tutorial, it kind of just puts you into a regualr game and gives you information as you click on new things with some very sugjested things to do. None of them are actually required to do when the tutorial promps you.All in all I think its a great game. Its fun and entertaining, the complexity is very high, but not so high its impossible to learn from no information. It just takes a little effort.			"

												Stellaris- What Sid Meyer's Beyond Earth Could have been. Essentially a Paradox Interactive game that plays like Endless Legend- all the best parts of Civilization with combat that makes sense. Learning curve is significantly lower than it is in other Paradox Interactive games although i have hundreds of hours in Europa Universailles IV so this opinion may be skewed.9/10 With DLC sure to come.

												This game is incredibly well crafted. If you like strategy and space, then I highly recommend this game. It is easily the golden standard of large scale space strategy. Summary: On the fence? Buy it. Frankly, I can't believe they got a game this ambitious, this well executed. There is a sharp learning curve early on (highly recommend using the Full tutorial aid) but once you understand the basic mechanics of the game, the game comes into it's own. Will update again after more play.  "

												Fabulous game, I have already sunk 6 hours into this game and will probably play it every day for, at least, another month. I've been waiting for this game for months, and I finally have it. :)Overall, it is the perfect mix of 4x and grand strategy. People have criticized the games shortcoming and bugs *cough* *cough* IGN, but just look at the support this game has.On day 1, I and many others experienced a stuttering bug. Where everything stuttered and made the game nearly unplayable. Now, on day 2, that has been fixed in a hotfix patch. The devs have even stated, in their launch stream, that they intend to release DLC adding what players think is the weakest part of the game.These are truly great devs. They have continued to support CK2 and EU4, and will do the same for Stellaris. This game is great now, but with Paradox's support over the years it could be a masterpiece.Overall, this game is a must buy.			"

												Played for nine hours right out of the gate and overall I am highly impressed and have enjoyed myself so far. I'm new to the grand strategy genre of games and so far with the help of the excellent tutorial I've been making my way through with little trouble in grasping the overall concept and gameplay mechanics. There's a ton of customization in this game from designing and outfitting your own ships to setting up your faction. I like how you can use our solar system as your starting point complete with all the planets. Graphics are great and remind me of Sins of a Solar Empire. Game runs smooth as glass with no slowdown or stuttering that some people are experiencing (i7 920, 7970, SSD). Over the course of nine hours only had one lockup that required a reboot but with the autosave option I only had to replay about 2 min of gameplay. No regrets with this one, can't wait to play some more!			"

												As a fan of Civ, I've often failed to get into space-based 4X games... Not the case with Stellaris. There is a bit of a learning curve, but less than that of Beyond Earth. The game is intuitive, and the tutorial is excellent - and dynamic. You aren't forced to follow a specific path even in learning the game. This game also nails the balance between war, civil development and diplomacy perfectly - all feel entirely viable and, at some point, necessary, to success. Would absolutely recommend based on what I've played so far.			"

												just spent about 7 hours playin it for the first time, i was a huge fan of sins of a solar empire and wasnt sure if there would ever be another game like it. this game shares alot with sins but also adds a TON of stuff you can do, you can customize the hell out of every game you play. you into researching that goes on forever and continually upgrades ur ships/structures? you like unit customization, yep its got that too, you want to make a battleships that also have drones/fighters, want to build defenses all over your territory, even got lots of diplomacy stuff although its more fun to just blow everyone up....ya anyway if your into space sims check it out, if your on the fence watch a youtube vid on gameplay, it sold me on it and im glad i took a chance. 5 stars!!

												With recent updates, I had a lot fun to design ships and to manage my fleet composition towards space battles.Comparing with HOI or EU series, this game surprisingly has the best navy battle mechanism. Although decisive battle doctrine still applies to this game, you cannot win a battle just by spamming covette/torpedo boat or battleship/carrier alone. Ships can be designed to counter smaller opponents or bigger opponents, and to win a battle you will need to have a healthy mix (or even better, to have ships designed to counter ships of your enemies when your know their designs).For player who wants to design and manage a grand fleet mixed with different types of ships that designed for different purposes, this will be a game you shouldn't miss.

												Verify different from your standard 4x and obviously influenced by their other work (especially CK II).Without going into too much detail, the main difference with this vs other 4x (Master of Orion for example), is just as with your Demense in CK II, you cannot control more than x planets without suffering penalties (nothing super major, but enough that ou don't want to go over by more than 1-2.Other major difference that makes it vastly more challenging (but not necessarily more difficult) than other space 4x: Terraforming is an end game tech (hopefully it stays this way, as it alters your strategy immensely, and adds a different dimension to the game).The end result is that this game, unlike other 4x, isn't a rush to grab as many planets as possible, then go from there. It requires careful calculation of where you'll invest your resources, and requires you to be careful with what planets you colonize. Only thing I'd change is add a 4th speed to make the game even faster, but then again as with EU and CK, by the end game the amount of processing required per day slows the speed down anyway.			"

												I have a spilt opinion for stellaris. When it was released it was pretty shi.t. Everything was fairly samey and the mid game was boring as hell to play through with the late game not being as great as hoped. But, it is way more fun in the 1.3 patch. More events, more A.I variety, more strategies. But then they put out dlc with the game not feeling finished. This game feels like an early access game but it was released as a finished one, which rubs me the wrong way. To sum it up, is it good? Yes, but it can be better. Should you buy it? If you're alright with the game not feeling entirely finished and alright with waiting for more patches. I don't regret buying the game too much. 30% out of 100. But if I knew about the state of the game before i bought it on day one then i would've waited. So far it seems like they want to continue working on the game, not sure for how long though. So if you want the game, the 1.3.1 patch is pretty fun on its own. Take that as you will.			"

												I'm barely into this game yet, but I like it a lot. It has the feel of Paradox's other Grand Strategy titles, but starting out with a single planet is much more laid back than starting out in most of their games. The random nature of the starting positions should keep things pretty fresh as well. I'm guilty in their other games as playing the same countries again and again, and this game isn't going to be like that. Also, knowing Paradox, this game will continue to be improved for years to come. I look forward to seeing where it goes. Highly recommended, especially if you're a fan of the developer!			"

												Loved it so far. A bunch of my friends have really been waiting for this, and we were so hyped up for the release today. Apart from one stutter glitch, I was really surprised at how *not* buggy this game was from release. These days, it seems most games come out on release with a plethora of game breaking bugs, or a few that ruin it for a lot. But not this game. I give a full recommendation, however I will admit there is a learning curve and if you don't do your research or let the game give you the full tutorial, you will get stuck! This is not a game to be felt out without help! I jumped right into a multiplayer with my friends, and even then it was hard.A few tibits extra about the game I liked:-Music is beautiful-Graphics are pretty and nice to look at-UI is *not* disgusting, it just is not for the faint of heart.-Races are creative, well drawn, and look cool-Quite a lot of techs and facets to exploreGreat day-one gameplay for me personally. Can't wait for the Star Wars, 40K, and Mass Effect Mods. I know they're coming!			"

Personally, I don't think this game disappoints at all. You have to have an appreciation for Paradox games to get it and some of those still may not. Love the soundtrack and feeling of galactic proportions this game so far seems to deliver. I actually feel like a fledgling starfaring explorer wondering what my actions may reap in the future as I start to make contacts as I explore the unkown. Love this game so far Paradox. Finally something to itch my star searching craving in a grand stratedy game where the game can be real time but not feel like Im being overwhelmed from every direction.

												Have not played a whole lot of this game yet, but so far its been very fun. The game as a whole is extremely complicated to someone knew to 4X games (like me). I have never played a 4X game or grand strategy game and it was difficult to learn the ropes at first. I had to lose an empire to get the hang of it.Once I figured the game out more my second try went much better. The game feels polished, there are no glaring glitches in the game. Be warned, if you are not interested in reading this is not the game for you! Nearly all information is given in the form of text and there are not many voice overs passed the tutorial sections. You will be presented with paragraphs to read. The tutorial system is kind of sub-par in my oppinion. Nothing is highlited during the tutorials, so some times finding where the tutorial wants you to click is difficult. There is no path for the tutorial, it kind of just puts you into a regualr game and gives you information as you click on new things with some very sugjested things to do. None of them are actually required to do when the tutorial promps you.All in all I think its a great game. Its fun and entertaining, the complexity is very high, but not so high its impossible to learn from no information. It just takes a little effort.			"

This game offers the same immersion but goes even deeper than M00 2, I genetically altered my human population on an ocean world and found out I had a new species afterward. Very cool.I have had hundreds of hours of enjoyment from every Paradox game I own and this game does not disappoint! I bought this purely based on my experience with Paradox (and my love for 4x space games) and I am glad they still produce quality like they did when I first bought EU 2.The only cons I have experienced that I was unable to rename my leaders (especially my sovereigns) or that I was unable to rename those genetically changed humans.

												This game is like a better Civ 3. It's like a better Endless Space (If you prefer RTS opposed to turn-based.)   It's one of the best Scifi space Rts's I've ever played. It could use a little extra polish in the form of optimization and clearing out a few bugs. When Vermintide released, it was VERY poorly optimized. Hell, when Ark came out (admittedly it was in EA for a long time) It needed weeks before it was playable on most machines.Stellaris is a game that's going to eat away every hour of spare time I have when I'm not working. (Please don't take my working hours too. I need to eat something more than ramen every once in a while.)If there is DLC it's almost instantly going to be a buy. An expansion? Insta buy. This game is amazing and feature-full. There's a lot of 'winks' / 'hat tilts' / 'easter-eggs' in the events, but they're not blatant like Borderlands games. It's not full of memes, but if you look carefully, you'll get what's going on.There's soooo many things I want to talk about event-wise, but I think all the fun is in finding them for yourself.The only thing I CAN'T recommend right now is Iron Man Mode. It saves constantly and really slows down the pace of things. The constant saving with the (eventual) optimization issues that come into play late-game, make it a bit rough at times.But with that said, this is a 10/10.This is Scifi RTS 4x perfected. Well done devs.			"

												So, I’m liking the game but I am unsure if it is my love for this style of game or the game itself I’m loving.  I can say I feel there were a few missed opportunities.  I’m a huge fan of CK2 and Imperium Galactica 2 (oh how I was hoping for a worthy successor).  I am enjoying the game thought so please don’t be discouraged.  Paradox has a record of improving games with mods/patches/DLC and stand by their titles.  So I’m not overly worried.Stellaris offers what many of us have been missing in that it is real time 4x space strategy game.  Finally no more “end turn” right?  Freely customizable race, easy modding, and a nice arrangement of traits/characteristics allow for replay ability.  Keep an eye out for mods in workshop though as they will probably be able to take the vanilla game further in its current state.Diplomacy could use some work.  Coming from an experience like CK2 where there is such a detailed level of advisors, intrigue, relationships, etc.… you will be underwhelmed by the diplomacy.  Like no joke, there’s not much to it…  Planets…  So I am not sure if I am for or against this rather dated style of planet/colony management.  It reminds me of Master of Orion where planets have tiles which can be modified to produce a resource based off the building.  It works for the game so I have no real complaints on it, just seems like an old mechanic that we have seen before.  Something I’m not too fond of is the planet control system and how your kind a forced to give up control of your systems to a governor after you a mass a few colonies.  I suppose if there was more interaction or even the feeling that I was handing over my territory to someone of value it wouldn’t be so bad.  However, it feels quite static.  Made me miss CK2 and long for those intriguing back stabbing plots to break away or declare independence from my rule.  There is little you can do to control how you want your sectors run and leaders again are quite static.  Not to mention limited in availability.  Don’t expect to have scientist, generals, admirals, and leaders everywhere or even in all the above areas.So combat is indeed 4x, but doesn’t really feel like it.  More or less move one fleet onto an enemy fleet and they swarm around firing.  No direct player control.  Again, not a complaint, it works.  And the UI window on battles during and after offers more details to help redesign your ships versus CK2 UI.  Sadly I feel the 4x component is wasted in this though…Overall the game is very vanilla, like not even vanilla bean, or vanilla with sprinkles….it’s just vanilla.  However, mods and time will tell if Paradox adds to it and brings us the enjoyment we have seen in other titles (CK2) (I mention CK2 because I’d so die happy for a CK2 in space type game).  I am enjoying it though and have already logged many hours since its release here.  I will leave you with this thought…  Recall back to the early days of CK2 and how it was at first launch, or even some other titles…  I’m just looking towards the future and ready to reach for my pocket book for the plethora of DLC to come.  :) "

												A very nice game with many fun aspects. I recommend trying different mods from the community as that spices up the game dramatically. I personally play with 5-10 different ones that fixes smaller issues or adding extra layers to the game. Avoid the Planetoids DLC as it doesnt really affect the overall-gameplay and save the money for something else. It mainly brings in a different race, which there are quite a few of anyway (and you can make your own aswell).The multiplayer element is really cool aswell and I like how easy it is to join the game even though you havent been there from the beginning. ""Wanna join? No worries, you can just take over one of the AI."" The main problem is being unable to synchronise mods in some way or atleast see which one is missing from the hosts own game. I dont think its unfair as the mods deviate from the original game design but when its such a nice sandbox game, why not help the community abit in making the game ""their own"". It isnt a unique flaw as it is the same with Total War: Warhammer.For gamers that love to spend time building an empire while still being able to command fleets of battleships, this game is a good choice.

												So far very good.  Take a classic space colinization and make many unique twists regarding UI, gameplay, and strategy.  Love the human element of leaders that get reelected and die.  A bit overwhelming at first as usually these games are, but find it rather straight forwards once you get the hang of it.  Busy restarting worlds after about an hour each time, as I learn more.  Addictive already.If you want a quick mod, go into the C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stellaris\common\traits\00_species_traitsfile.  Change one of the traits like intelligent to cost like -20 instead of 2.  Now you can start a super race, with some extra power to counter the learning curve.  There is no easy level, just normal.  So don't feel wrong to cheat a little.			"

												So, review time. I have only played this game for 80 minutes so far, so take this as a 'first impressions' review. Starting off, it can be a little overwhelming as it is different yet also the same as most other Paradox games. At first, there is a feeling of tension as you know what will happen and you move to get yourself suited for first contact. As with any new game there is also a learning curve, but it is not very steep at all. The soundtrack is amazing and has kept me completely immersed in my space-fairing adventures. The tutorial however, while comprehensive. can be a bit annoying becuase it completely covers your list of what to do. That said the tutorial guide is quirky and can even bring out a few good chuckles. All in all from a beginners point of view, this game is great. Perhaps not a must buy for anyone unwilling to learn something new, but if you dont fall into that category then congratulations you have a potential new game in your library that can be played for hours on end!

												Big tumbs up for this game. I got it yesterday and then played for 11 hours straight. Then I realized it was 6:30 am...... The game had me so immersed I just forgot the time. Some reviews liken this game to MOO 2. I second that. This game offers the same immersion but goes even deeper than M00 2, I genetically altered my human population on an ocean world and found out I had a new species afterward. Very cool.I have had hundreds of hours of enjoyment from every Paradox game I own and this game does not disappoint! I bought this purely based on my experience with Paradox (and my love for 4x space games) and I am glad they still produce quality like they did when I first bought EU 2.The only cons I have experienced that I was unable to rename my leaders (especially my sovereigns) or that I was unable to rename those genetically changed humans. But I am sure it will get added with patch/dlc/mod eventually.So far I give this game a 10/10			"

												Of course this game isnt perfect.I do agree with some points in the negative reviews (AI Agression, etc.).  You should have serious reason to crap yourself when you discover that advanced start lurking just a couple jumps away.  Right now it feels like I can just drop an embassy on them and walk away, even if we are diometrically opposed in ideologies.At first I found the UI to be horriblly clunky, after an hour or two that was a non-issue.  There's definitely a few things to brush up on there (not de-selecting my ship when I left click to cancel a right click order for one.)Is this a better game than the new MOO?  (With a single tear in eye) Yes, x1000,In the end, in its current state I would still recommend this to Space 4x fans.			"

												Probably one of the most interesting and fun games I've played. And I've barely gotten to mid-game if that even. So many possibilities for how you can play so I just keep restarting to try things out. Sure there are a few buggy things here and there, and definitely a number of things where you go ""boy I wish this was a feature"" but if you look at any other Paradox game (I've only played V2 and CK2 well after they were released) there should be a ton of DLC to add even more. Only major downside is that the UI gets kinda small on larger screens. My resolution is at 2160x1440 and I have to get pretty close to see it super well. But this just seems to be a Paradox issue. Not game breaking, but more of a quality of life problem.I'd put it more complete than Civ 5 was at release, with as much or even potential to get better later.9/10 definitely get it if you like 4X or space.

												Make no mistake this is a continuation of Europa Universalis in it's core gameplay. What's changed is: - the decor has become magnificent. Instead of stinky medieval empires, you control and encounter, or deal with and suffer from space age stuff. (I took a risk of 22% to explore a gas giant. I ended up setting of a chain reaction that killed off the entire indegenious species that lived in those clouds... whoops).- EU4 armies are now fully configurable corvettes, destroyers, cruisers and battleships, with modules, you can configure under 3 researchable tech trees. - so much other stuff... Anyway, there are still some problems with diplomacy, and some imbalance in weapons... But for the first time, the game is moddable! So modders can help developp the game further.			"

												I have played this game 19 of the 50 hours since release. I am often disappointed with games at start and I like games that feel more complete and Paradox are notoriously bad at that, making games that seem more like good ideas until a couple of DLCs in. This game is not like that.I think Stellaris might be the best game that I've played. All the 4 X:s of eXploration, eXpansion, eXploitation, and eXtermination are fun. It got character and it got style, the small speeches by alien (and human) empires are well-written and colourful, that alien empires insult you if they find what you're doing bad is amusing and the AI behaves logically.One bad thing. The game is buggy. This will improve soon, since Paradox are good at putting out patches in good time.Apart from that I have yet to find faults. 10/10. Possibly the best game I've ever played.			"

												For folks looking for space exploration and empire builders, the 4X crowd, this is your holy grail.  Early game focuses on exploration, charting, and colonization with strong barriers blocking the normal early-game colony rush.  Science and discovery is as important as raw resource might in this phase and adds endless charm and uniqueness to each game.Mid game transitions into one of diplomacy and early warfare as you and your neighbors establish a pecking order.  Exploration still occurs but the sites are dwindling by this point.Late game moves into vast empires and federations staking claims and rearranging neighborhoods all over slights big and small.Add to this late game crises (extra-dimensional invaders for example), relic ancient empires vastly beyond your starting capacity, nascent and emerging low-tech races, and a rewarding tech system you have a game that breathes fun and freshness in every play through.Personally, this is what I've been waiting for nearly 20 years.It was worth the wait.  And even more so now with the post-release improvements!			"

The AI is really intelligent and makes alliances to counter your influence and expansion.And the mod support, yeah, this is great, it's simple making changes to let's say; traits or even the custom race file, if you wanna cheat, or just make more traits in general.They have put allot of support to the modding community, I am not surprised at all, it's paradox after all.Update @ around 170+ hoursExpansions.. EXPANSIONS, the leviathans expansion brings something new to the End game and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for some wonderful end game content.

												Its good. Its actually better than good. 4X Space strategy game similar to Endless Space and Master of Orion. Huge galaxies up to 1000 systems each. You can have a small number of core systems (4-5) that you need to micromanage throughout the game, but beyond that you need to allocate systems into sectors, under the control of governors. Within a sector all the building is automated, except for warships. You can generally tell a sector to specialise in collecting energy (creds), minerals, research or defence. You can also set empire policies and sector policies that influence how fast your race drifts from the original colonists of your homeworld. This is where the game shines. They automate the micromanagement of individual population units, but you still have to worry non-stop about the politics of your Empire. For example, I uplifted some random animal species and made them intelligent voting members of the Empire. Sects within the Empire popped up centered around the spiritualism of uplifting species, and the animals I uplifted didnt have time to adapt culturally so the became a collectivist entity. One generation later and I have 2 revolts within my Empire happening while I am fighting a war against a robot hive mind. Meanwhile my open migration policy for the last 100 years has caused another sector of my empire to relate more to the bird people Empire than to the humans from Terra, and one system breaks away wanting to be part of an independent protectorate within the Empire. Its well worth checking out. You wont get the cinematic battles of Endless Space, but it is absolutely riveting to play through this game.  "

												This was my last game:Fueled by a strong economy and free migration policies, the Democratic Union of Humans (DUH) was the pre-eminent empire that liberated planets from the cruel and tyrranical rule of despotic rulers across the galaxy.  As other empires found that peace was better than war, they established open migration treaties to ensure harmony and cooperation between the empires.  Unfortunately, DUH attracted most of the unwanted populations from other empires and quickly became saddled with heavy social welfare programs to keep everyone happy.  Soon thereafter, the programs proved too expensive to sustain leaving DUH with unhappy and unproductive planets.  The failure cascade accelerated with the failing economy as DUH found it unable to support its military to protect its borders from opportunistic empires and quell internal rebellions for independence.  Sadly, the DUH experiment failed and the very populations that were unhappy with the freedoms they enjoyed found themselves conquered and enslaved... But at least they were happier in the end!  Or purged...Next game I am getting the collectivist trait.			"

That is all.""Great customization, exploration is excellent although in a few hours depending on your ethnics you will be blocked from exploration and discovery by primite space empires so you have to switch to the extermination aspect of stellaris and just wipe them out or force them to submit by your zerg spawm of corvettes or the menacing power of your 40+ battleship swarm as you bombard their planet back into the stone age. Researching is a bit of a pain as sometimes you just can't seem to get the tech you are looking for or sometimes just never because of RNG but overall it is good. Customizing your ships is fun, you can try and min-max your ship types or just go all out in one type of tech.Overall stellaris is a great game, worthy of my $40 and expansion I have to pay for			"

												I have owned this game for some time now, and can say it is pretty solid. There is a learning curve, though you can say this for most 4X games, that said, it is familiar enough to just step in a give a go. I can recommend this game to those seeking a reasonable challenge, and enjoy long games that involve war and peace time events of which this title will deliver.			"

												This is game I should like, instead it has become an excersize in frustration.Want an example ?Google Stellaris fleet sizes, or fleet caps. See the answers experts give to questions about fleet sizes. Usually it goes along the lines of I have 24k in my fleet, they never actually answer the posters question and those that try too leave out vital information. So most players, dont actually know how this game works, they just manage to some how stumble on a formula that works. You see the answer to that question pretty much reveals the games flaws. Fleet caps are a combination of space station upgrades, large populations and research. Where as research goes faster when you only have a small population. So the larger your population gets, the slower you research is and the larger your fleet becomes. From then on you fall behind and end up losing to an empire with only 3 planets to its name. So you have to gather research resources to boost your research as your empire expands, this means expanding slowly, letting your population on planets grow before settling new ones and using your influence to build frontier out posts in resource rich areas. These require energy and energy is the one thing that is in short supply. So you have to balance expansion, with research with the need to build mines and research out posts in order to keep your empire growing and competative. That is why nobody ever answers that question properly. Sounds like I just did right, well kind of.You see, whilst your happy with your 2000 strength fleet, that 3 planet AI turns up with a 16,000 strength fleet that it really should not have because you now know how that fleet cap is worked out now and you can see from the diplomacy screen that his tech level is not any higher than yours, so his fleet should at best be comparable to yours. So you know beyond any doubt that the AI cheats like crazy and whilst your limited by these rules, it is not.Next we come to diplomacy, an AI that loves you to bits makes you its rival, which gives you an instant -100 rep with that AI. All the bonuses recieved before that gave it a +93 rep, meaning it loved you to bit, yet sees you as its enemy. It attacks you, you beat it. You conquer all its planets, destroy all its mines and out posts and end up drawn in a war because its ally beat your ally. Even though you pretty much wiped him out. After the war, a truce is declared and your ally invites this AI in to your Federation, before the flames of war have even gone out, this AI is now your best friend and the truce setting is still clearly visible on the AI that is now your ally. Meaning that uneasy post war peace is still uneasy as it joins your federation and becomes your bestie.These 2 examples reveal what is wrong with this game, it is less of game you play and more of a system you learn and then exploit. It makes very little sense because the game mechanics are not there to make game play, they are to stop one AI from steam rolling the entire galaxy. You see, if they just let an AI grow and linked research to empire size as most games do, then the biggest AI would always win. So instead they make the smallest AI research things faster, so they catch up, grow in size, suddenly their research slows down and they become an out dated large empire too. Mean while the tiny Mr Nobody empire with only 3 planets has quietly researched everything and is now a super power that nobody can beat. That is whats wrong with this game, the mechanics make no sense so you end up playing the system, not the game. In infact, I am absolutely certain the lead designer spends his nights licking magic mushrooms in some damp English field someplace. If you like spending 70 hours saying WTF, I strongly recommend this game, but if you dont, go and by Galactic Civ 3 instead. At least that makes sense. And remember the reason people tend not to answer questions properly about this game is because they dont actually know how it works either.  Just ask them for a full answer and you see what I mean.Just to ram that point home, look at the Global Achievements for this game, only 19% of those who buy it manage to settle a planet. In game thats pretty much about settling planets, that means 81% of those who buy it dont even get started in this game.			"

												This is one of the first games I have pre-ordered, I was betting on the fact that since Paradox was making this game (which also used the new ClausWitz engine) that Stellaris would be a great game... and it is. The UI is smart and easy to read/understand, the Advisor gives useful tips while not making you feel like a complete idiot for not understanding. Like all Paradox games this is not the easiest game to get into, its complexity is a beauty of its own just like in CK2 and EU4 but it has its own feel to it- it takes a completely different approach into Real Time Grand Strategy Games.Great Game, 10/10 would recomend to everyone who enjoys/wants to start playing a Grand Strategy game. Really decent price too considering the content/gameplay you will get out of it- especially with all the mod which will be created some time in the near future			"

												So I'm going to start out by saying I've never played Europa Universalis 4 or any other EU game but I'm in love with the civilization series. Now, I know there's not much of a correlation between civ and EU but let's talk about Stellaris. Stellaris gives me that adventurous feel of being able to make decisions and struggle to make other nations around me do what I want them to do. That's the strength in Stellaris. How accessible is the game to a beginner? I'd say it's accessible enough that you will learn new things every time you play through it and learn what techs do what and what strategies work and what don't. The technologies are learned through a little bit of RNG with some weights to make sure you eventually get the important stuff (like a colony ship etc). The game is chalk full of hilarious scientific arguements and references to a ton of stuff. One of my favorites is the teapot behind the sun anamoly, 'cuz it's just funny to think about.Anyway is the game worth the price? Hell yes. Also yay for Mod Support - that'll add some value to the game for sure.			"

												This is the best 4x I have ever played. I got it today and I have been playing it nonstop since I downloaded it. I highly recomend it. It combines my favorites aspects of both grand strategy and 4x. The graphics and user interface is incredible. It is the most accessible paradox game I have ever played and I have played all of paradox's grand strategy games. The lack of a tech tree makes gameplay more emergent and interesting. So many aspects combine to make it impossible for any two campaigns to be the same. The early game is an exciting colonization race. The midgame smoothly transitions from a more 4x style gameplay to one the is more similar to eu4. There are many novel ideas. If you want to see streams of stellaris being played, look at the blorg streams and the london multiplayer streams on twitch by ParadoxInteractive. I would give this game 10/10.			"

												Stellaris will be a good game someday. But as it is, most of the fun comes from modders adding content to what is on its own really just the framework for a much better game waiting to be created. I imagine as the years pass and Paradox, being as DLC happy as they are, release more and more updates and expansions we will eventually see Stellaris blossom into a solid 4X game to rival even the best on the market. But for now it's a glorified sandbox for modders to play in. It reminds me a lot of Paradox's Crusader Kings 2 in this regard, which was also a game that was merely okay upon launch and didn't really come into it's own until many expansions later.So if you don't mind browsing the workshop to bring out the games potential, certainly pick it up. And then put it away and check back in a few years when Paradox has totally overhauled it via expansion packs and DLC.			"

												Excellent, game, vast in scope, seriously engrossing with a political and diplomacy system I can see real value in. The map is huge, the variety of aliens impressive.  Each is dynamically created so never can you predict their stance.Iam on my first game and it seems to be a very long haul experience which is just what I am after.  So far, I have been seriously impressed with it and it just keeps getting better.  If it keeps going like this and it continues to be enhanced in dlc and patches then this game will carry on being a 10/10 game for me.			"

												Well, I have been managing 12.3 hours per day since it came out, and it is fun.My main hang up is that the game is a bit unfinished and it needs more fine tuning in how the sectors work. Mid-game content is somewhat lacking, as it seems all of the events were made for the beginning and the end of the game.Besides that, everything is extremely fun, especially preparing for war.			"

												Before I get into the review I will simply say this, If you like Civilization, you will like this. Buy it.Words can not describe how much fun this game is. This is probably going to be my first 1000 hour game. On to the review.Also I want to mention that I never found the interface to be 'Bad' or 'complicated' I learned it after 2 games and never had any issues.This game is a gem in the space strategy genre and will only improve as mods continue to pour in.A great mix between grand strategy, 4x, and a little bit of CIV5 sprinkled on top.I started the game expecting this to be super complicated and hard to learn (and I can see how it could be for novice strategy players perhaps) Luckily this game has a good tutorial.The 'Tutorial' is a little A.I. Assistant that is well voiced and even a little funny. He will describe the process of running an empire down to the little details, and after only 2 shortish games I was ready to play with limited help, and on the third game I turned the tips off. I was constantly immersed in this massive (if you choose it to be) galaxy, in which I interacted with species ranging to Xenophobic Zealot snapping turtle people, to Democratic Crusader parrot people who detest dictators . In my second game I was surrounded on my left and right by xenophobic spiritualists who wanted nothing more than to destroy my military republic, luckily I used a preemptive strike to vassalize the empire to my east, and with our combined forces I vassalized the empire to the west becoming the most powerful species in only an hour and a half of gameplay!Gameplay mechanics:On your planets you have to build on the various tiles of land masses. These can range from mining stations to collect valuable minerals, to power plants to collect the all important energy.In order to build and maintain a large fleet you need to have a large amount of minerals and energy coming in or you will find yourself with no money to spend on planet development. You also need to balance out the research buildings to advance your empires technology level.You can create custom ships by picking different modules, such as a module with 4 small guns or a module with one big gun. Ships in your navy range from corvettes to massive battleships.You can choose to equip your ship with tons of armor, or high powered shields, Lasers, Missiles, ECT.Ship combat is fairly average at worst. Reminds me a bit of RISK. With your fleet strength measured in a number over their heads.Sometimes if you have very good missile defense systems on your ships and fight an enemy fleet that only uses missiles you can absolutely tear them a new one without any losses, but the strategy does not really get much deeper.Planet Combat:Planet invasions are pretty simple. You can build an army ranging from simple soldiers to freaking Xenomorphs (not kidding thats what they are called in game). Which is pretty cool. You orbitally bombard the planet to weaken their defenses and then land your troops, if you have a better army you win and control the planet. Easy.There is so much in this game I can hardly describe it all, so I will get on to the bad stuff-Game runs poorly on my computer late gameMy computer is not a beast but with an i3-4160 and an AMD R9 270x, that should be more than enough for this game which leads to my next problem--NO GRAPHICS OPTIONSBesides multisampling and resolution there are no graphics settings in any menus. You can do some stuff in the command menu in game, but it should be in the options.-Combat is pretty meh. Planet invasions are pretty lame especially with the cool armies you can make.You just watch a small icon of your army land on a picture of a planet. A little dissapointing after I started getting cool stuff like Xenomorphs and Gene Warrior armies (Basically Spartan Super soldiers). Imagine Spartans riding Xenomorphs into battle who wouldnt want to see that??Overall I rate this game a good 8.5/10 I very much look forward to expanded content and some sweet mods.P.S. You can change alliance names and federation names by clicking the icon in the lower right hand corner :) "

												Very good, just the way a 4x game should be. The developers roadmap forward looks great, and will most likely take care of most of my issues with the game. these are:1. after starting and playing around i realise that the amounts of large random events at start are not so many, maybe 3-4 big ones and a few smaller coupled to the first space-living creatures.  Needs to be improved2. lack of midgame random events.3. The AI is as usual not so good in 4x games 4. The diplomacy is weak in many areas.The reasonable simplistic warfare and dependancy on sectors is promising for the biggest weakness in all 4x games, the ai. Therefore tha ai should be easier to fix.Still its a fun game and i spend alot of time in it. Not like gal. civ 3, which was a big dissapointment.			"

												I have played many strategy games in my time. And if there was ever a well made space strategy, grand strategy, where almost ANYTHING can happen. This would be it. And I totally reccomend this game to anyone who loves Sci-Fi and Strategy. This game is Civ meets Sins Of A Solar Empire and an amazing part is that the developer knows how amazing their game is so they are still constructing things tweaking things and making it better with stellar (pun intended) content.There are problems when it comes to giant scenarios or large fleet battles. Ship battles get very cluttered and infantry batles don't make sense, especially if you have the clear advantage and still manage to lose the battle.Sometimes the game lags drastically especially in the large maps. I definitly reccomend having a high-mid grade PC build just to get the best out of the game.But all in all this game is complex underneath and it surprises me almost every time. Throw mods in the mix and things go to♥♥♥♥♥♥real quick.Fun game to pass time or to dive into. I tottally reccomend it			"

												This is a fun, relaxing game... until an intergalactic bug race decides to invade and take over your galaxy.  You ally with a Stagnant Acendancy to defeat the invasion, discecting the Queen bug to learn their secrets.  By the time the bug threat is dealt with, a different ancient powerful race awakens and decides it doesn't like your face, your ascendant ally, or anyone else who doesn't bow down to their religion.  You fight the good fight, in the face of overwhelming odds, but in the end your fleet is descimated and your empire falls to religious nutjobs who look like Toad from Super Mario Bros.Time to start a new empire, with more of a fleet focus.Definitely a good time sink, you can micromanage your empire, or divide it up into sectors for less oversight.  Late game research can get tedious, but amassing a +100K fleet and dominating your enemies sure feels good.			"

												I cautiously recommend it. It's a good game, but it has some features that people might not like.The negatives:Highly depends on RNG. I do not usually call it a negative, but the only events that matter have negative influence on the wellbeing of your empire: if you are not prepared, it's a game over. As these particular events - yes, I'm talking about crisises - happen in late game, all your progress becomes nullified, which sometimes can be rather annoying. Customisation is wast, yet is restricted. You have to choose the presents, not the bonuses directly, which in my opinion could push the customisation to it's glorious limits.Wars are not great. You can't control directly your fleet. Conquering the planes is a redundant mini-game that slows you down - simply because you use soldiers only when you have won all the space battles and is bombing the plants' fortification - taking them without bombing is 75 times harder for armies.AI is weird, just like in your usual strategy game of this genre.Yes, this is a positive review. The game itself is good and easily enjoyable. It has something that was making you to make that 'one more turn' in Civilization games.			"

												Im going to tell you right now; early game content is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. People have actually posted valid complaints about this game, but let me tell you, this game is worth it. I can feel the huge potential for this game, and with the free patches coming up in May/June/July, mid-game should get a huge polishing, and hopefully late-game lag is fixed, but this game unravels a story around your choices and your ethos, so each playthrough is a story you could actually write a decent novel out of. Add mid-game colonial events and factions, and you got yourself a space opera spanning systems and borders, with deadly threats within and without. Beware the robot slaves.			"

												So, this game is probably not for everyone, but I'm really enjoying it.Do you like other Paradox games where the goal is...well, whatever you want, since there is no win scenario? Then you'll likely like this (though you actually CAN win this one).  If you don't? Well...You build a galactic empire, starting from a single planet. You encounter other races, you can ""uplift"" some, or infiltrate some technologically inferior ones to take over, etc. There are so many options, so many ways to grow, that there are many different decisions you can make.However, the game can bog down once you get fairly in and have completely mapped your area. At that point, you might have to start conquering whatever you can around you to keep expanding. That can get difficult and boring, but it's Paradox, so if you like EU or CK, you're probably used to that by now.  (And, in my experience, this is worse the bigger the map.  Try with the smaller maps first!)			"

There have been interesting updates making the game more challenging, realistic, and entertaining making me look forward to a continuing active community and developer patch work.

												Okay, so this is a game that requires a lot of gameplay to really have a good feel for it but so far, I have played it about ... 12 hrs or so and it's the middle of the night and my eyes are sore.... reminds me of the days when I discovered moo2.  Great 4x game, most of the tedious stuff can be done by your AI so you just plan your expansion and conflicts. Die alien scum! Not so sure I like the research system but... maybe I just haven't figured it all out yet.Edit:I have played a bit more and although I have found some room for improvement I still really enjoy this game. The issue I have is that there needs to be some more tools to automate some processes. I need an interface to access the empires entire spaceports and let AI build my fleet according to my specifications (%'s of this ship and that, max fleet upkeep, etc)I wish I could set a construction ship to just auto build mining and research stations in all controlled space, I wish I could set a science ship up with priorities like 1) research anomaly, 2) survey controlled space, 3) survey unknown systems in reach 4) assist a planet in research.I wish I could have a colonizing advisor that I could instruct with what race to seed each planet with, what traits to try towards, and options like only controlled systems, a minimum amount of influence, and ways to adjust the prioritizing of planets, like adjust how different factors are weighted (nearness to capital, useable tiles, tolerance of that type of planet, min tolerance to attempt).

												I *COULD* give a long, serious review, but that isn't how we do it.I will tell you instead, the story of the Last Pond, and how the grand empire got slaughtered from the inside. More specifically, the Turtle people, and their Grand Admiral: GroxThe Rivians were a peaceful race on a small moon, in the early space age.One day, they launched a space ship, and found many more advanced travelers of the stars.Along their borders, were the Ducks. The ducks took over anyone that was a♥♥♥♥♥♥to them, leading them to take over half the galaxy. The Rivians were all like ""Yo bois, don't kill us, we wanna be ur bois!"" The Ducks didn't take them seriously, and waltzed over another nation, much bigger than them. The Ducks made their biggest mistake: Giving the primitaves all their research. When Grox was born, the Ducks had taken over almost all of the galaxy. The Rivians were quietly building warships from their two planets in the romote corner of the galaxy, unable to expand because of the Duck borders. The ducks disregarded the Rivians, and ♥♥♥♥ed off to kill all the bigger guys. But what the ducks didn't know, was that the small little empire had 2x the military power in those two systems.The Ducks had started to prepare to kill off the North-Easterners, the last of the challenges, excluding the 4 fallen empires. ...Or so they thought. The Rivians needed people to lead their grand navy, and Grox outpreformed everyjuan else.He led the grand battlefleet, and they declared war on the Ducks.The ducks said ""What? This tiny little nation declared war on us? Send some troops over there to Roflstomp them."" They then checked the Power score, and said ""Wait... What the ♥♥♥♥?"" They watched as the Duck army jumped over, slowly, to the other side of the galaxy. At this point, the Rivians were Dunking on all the planets on that side of the Galaxy. The great battle commenced. After an epic battle between the brightest of the Ducks, and Grox.Grox killed all of them.He killed the millions of Ducks on those battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and even a few corvettes.He escaped with barely 10k Power Score. A fallen empire decided ""Lol you know what would be funny? If we killed these dux while they rebuilt their navy.""The white peace was offered for a few worlds near the Rivian Homeworld.The ducks barely held the fallen empire back, as they won, and gathered the technology.... The Rivians came back. Even more developed, even more built up.The ducks came to the defense, against an 110 year old Grox (Rivians had super life perk).The ducks put up a valiant defense, but in the end, got steamrolled by Grox.The Rivians took land, allied with every empire left, all the tiny ones the Ducks forgot, all the Northeasterners. They all came in, and stomped the Final Pond. The ducks held their core worlds valiantly, but in the end, they were wiped out.Unfortunately, the duck leader was a dumbass and put on Ironman for his first game.ffs Stupid AI-Enhancement mods.			"

This game has just about everything you could want; exploration, diplomacy, war, trade; and all in SPACE!The beginning of the game is very much exploration and expansion, how long this lasts depends on how many other civilizations you start with.  Once you start meeting them the mid game starts and you need to decide if you are going to become bigger through diplomacy or war.  And then once you think you are powerful to take on the fallen empires (once galaxy rulers) even greater threats appear.Overall this is an absolutely amazing game and I recommend it to all that are interested in the strategy genre.  In fact it is probably the best game to get into Paradox's Grand Strategy games as the exploration and expansion ease you into the diplomacy and war.This is just single player.  Multiplayer I'd have to say is the best of any Paradox game I have played.  No desync issues, just slowing of the game in major battles.			"

												Very good Paradox game for Grand Strategy Starters. Graphics are nice but could be better, thank God for the great Modding Community. Game runs pretty smooth up to 800 Stars and starts to lag a little bit in the endgame (hope there will be some improvements made). The only negative thing i have to say about Stellaris are the little War-Options you are given. There are only three (Cede/Liberate Planet, Vassalize (Protektorate if you are really advanced in comparison to your enemy)) which makes no sense in a huge Galaxy with multiple different Species, thank God for the great Modding Community... again. After all i have played, I really recommend this game. Vanilla is great and with mods it becomes awesome.Notebook I play on: I7 2,6GHz, 16GB DDR4, GTX 960MMods I can recommend: Total Conversion with ""Fight for Universe - Infinite Legacy"" improves Game overall but not the war demands. also check out ""Expended War Demands"", ""Beautiful Battles"" and much more			"

												This is probably gonna be one of my first serious reveiws so excuse me if its not that good.Anways its a good game but it feels like it lacks some content Not enough options with the ai multiplayer was buggy (at least for me when i tried to talk it brought up all the hotkey menus) it should have more events also maybe more weapon types and ship types also.one of my first paradox games but i love it i would love to see more content added.7/10 over all played 97.8 hours in 6 days (wow i still though it was the second)has some bugs that need to be worked out and some issues with lag in game (fps are fine its a different type of lag)good game. check it out on youtude before you buy to see if you would like it maybe only 2-3 episodes there is enough content already it wont spoil much.

												Stellaris is an amazing video game, and in some ways its the grand space civ i've always wanted. I wish managing leaders and your government was a bit more involved because right now there is a lack of interesting decisions to make in the mid game. In its current state (1.2) the amount of random events (similar to FTL) is too small, and I see the same ones around the same time in every new playthrough. Adding a ton of new events and political intrigue (like Crusader Kings 2) could really spice things up, and I'd be more than willing to pay for them as DLC because the management part of this game is fantastic.

												I have only recently gotten into Paradox games and this already stands out as one of my favorites. I played a lot of Eu4 (Europa Universalis 4) before this and this game spices things up as compared to other Paradox games. I love how creative you can get with names, backstory, etc. In short this game is very fun. However, it can get dull sometimes but I bet this will change with future dlcs and patches.			"

												I love this game.  I love how it changes as you grow through it.  Things that don't seem very useful early become very important later, things you thought you didn't need anymore you suddenly do again.  Things are changing and growing, and roles are shifting.Example:  Construction ships:  You've built all the mining platforms you can, but instead of being pointless, now you can build defensive platforms with them, which weren't available early on. The game seems to be full of that.   "

												I have 50 hours into this game. With respect to grand strategy, It is one of the best games I have ever played. As far as tactical battle, the game is merely cinema with a rpg element. If you are looking for a great tactical game, try XCOMM 2 instead. If you are looking for a well conceived strategy game, you can't do better than Stellaris.I have started the game over multiple times. Every start is very unique due to a multitude of parameters, quests, and research randomness. It definitely lends itself to replayability. To the developer that came up with the system of dual research (three scientists in the lab as well as science ships in space), I tip my hat to your brilliance. For you grand strategy geeks, those of you that embrace a stiff learning curve, this is a ""must have"" game.			"

												The best x4 RTS I have ever played, now i'm glad to have pre-ordered it.The base game on release was rather dodgy, only military campaigns and planet science worked however diplomacy was awful and unless you were on the highest difficulty and even then the mid-late-end game was incredibly dull if you were not in an alliance or waging war left, right and center. For a game pre ordered it was not worth it maybe for somthing to pick up on sale but not pre-ordered BUT there have been some big patches and some more planed that are/will be alot like the big dlcs for civ v ((gods and kings, brave new world) game changing in a good way) but free.Really paradox should have sold stellaris as just exited early accses or beta as there was so little there you could do outside of military, the continued updates have realy help and i recomend this to any RTS or or even city builder fan.Im only giving this an upvote for the free updates that are not being bundled in to dlc (unlike citties: skylines).Get stellaris :D theres also epic mods..

												I have to say, i ♥♥♥♥ing love this game, though admittedly my basis here will be greatly influenced by the fact that i play with a lot of mods, which isnt neccesarily a bad thing, but some systems like for example Sectors, i just dont have experience with because i just dont use them due to mods. I was actually pretty apprehensive about buying the game, and who can blame me? Look at other paradox games like CK2 and try and tell me those are great easy to jump into games. I decided to buy the game after watching a few episodes of the Blorg playthrough (Resistance is impolite). They have on youtube. Its a great way to get an idea of how the game progresses from the beginning onwards. The game starts with you in a single system, as a species of myriad origin, having just unlocked your first FTL method. These can be Warp, slow but unrestricted, Hyperlanes, fast but restricted, and Wormholes, extremely fast and with decent range, but has a minor annoyance of having to build wormhole stations. You start with a few corvettes and a science ship along with a minor income level for minerals and energy credits and a small amount of researching ability and the game progresses from there. Customizability is fabulous, Design bird people that hate everyone who's alien and are willing to defend their lands with military might. Or design these people as a peaceful theocracy who build federations and grand alliances to protect themselves through allies.(More on this later) I thoroughly enjoy this aspect of the game and its made replayability fun, atleast for me.Gameplay is mostly managing cities, your people and to a lesser extent your policies, You also have chances to get rare technologies which can be incredibly strong or miraculously mediocre. Thankfully the vast majority of all technologies are well worth researching, Lasers especially are a joy to behold in battles watching huge swathes of ships cut an explosive path through opposing fleets is a joy to see. But you will spend most your time managing your respective leaders of your civ, and depending on your goverment type, elections. I personally due to no sectors spend a bit more time micromanaging my cities, as once you get more than 10+ planets it really is something you are just doing ALL the time, and other things like wars are just distractions from this. But thats how i prefer these games.Politics to be frank for me, were a little dissapointing. the Trust system, atleast for me never really held any meaning for me because i tend to play extremely aggressive empires. nobody ever ends up trusting me in the game(NOBODY) and im generally in a situation where its Me versus the world. But again that is just how i play, for a more peaceful player the systems probably fine, i just dont have that experience.Steam workshop support is fabulous for the longevity of the game, as mods for lots of different things, from empire colors to Flag emblems and beyond are made for the game. Also the glorious Exterminatus from the WH40k universe can be brought in. Sign the death warrant of an entire world, and consign a billlion souls to oblivion. Its awesome and i cant wait to check every few days to see what new upcoming idea modders have come up with. Its great and i can honestly say i cant imagine the game without this as it allows for so much silly♥♥♥♥♥♥to be in Stellaris as well as more serious and respectable mods.Stellaris's greatest qualities in my opinion are its Customizability, both in game for various empires, as custom made ones are allowed, and in the Workshop support to modify the rules and boundaries of the game. The battles are enjoyable but really its a hand off affair, which can be good or bad depending on your point of view. Overall if your new to Grand Strategy i think this would be a great way to enter it, but if your into more in-depth games, like CK2, i might suggest skipping it. For most people though i think Stellaris is worth its purchase price, However if you are really on the fence for the game id suggest waiting for a sale. Paradox usually have great sales on steam and it would be an absolute steal if you got it for 20$. Id rate it 8/8 Gr8 B8 M8			"

												The early game of Stellaris is perhaps one of my favorite moments of any game. Creating a new alien species with the detailed Emprie Creation system, sending out science ships to explore and survey the surrounding solar systems, discovering and solving the mysteries of your universe, researching new technologies to vastly change your empire. However in mid-late game things begin to slow down and grow boring, while they attempted to fix this with the Leviathans DLC (which added some interesting new things, I suggest it) the mid-late game is still somewhat bland.

For example, they have the Plus ""+"" for time on the left of the minus ""-"" button. This is simply the opposite that my brain expects. In addition, the pause key is not mapped to ""Pause"" time but instead the space bar is mapped.Anyway, the game may seem complex and difficult do to some short commings on the UX but the game is fantastic.

												""Worthy of the hype."" - Me, just now. I was sceptical of Stellaris. I've tried other 4x games and few of them hit the spot. But Stellaris had me from the start. I think the visuals help - there's not a hexagon in sight! The richness of the scifi is great too - I could roll-play a book I'm reading (Pandoras Star, Peter F Hamilton) and it's reminiscent enough of other SciFi - Ian Banks, Stephen Baxter and so on that I feel like those stories could be taking place in the Stellaris' Universe. It's a slow-paced game but it's not turn based - you can control the speed at which the un-paused game passes so if nothing interesting is happening till you build your next Colony Ship (for example) then you can speed things up - so slow-paced but not boring in the way I found Gal Civ 3 for example. Watch a Let's Play, then get the Galaxy Edition (cdkeys gave the best deal at time of writing) to also enjoy a novel, sound track and other goodies.Top tip - for your first game I'd recommend playing against only minor races till you learn the ropes.

												This has very quickly become my favorite 4x of all time. Most know how 4x works, so I'll just highlight what puts this on top for me. The only game that comes close to giving you that feeling of a immersive story in the 4x genre is Civ5 and that's partly down to the historical familiarity; this game achieves that without it and arguably better. They really have made the eXplore side of the game very intriguing, simply sending out a science vessal (scout) to each and every system you can, sounds labourious but it has you hanging with speculation and excitement. The diplomacy side of the game is unparrelled in the space 4x and it really is a welcome level of complexity brought in from their experience with their Europa series. I didn't think I'd like the realtime aspect as much as I do but it really fits well with this game, and I'm really looking forward to trying this out multiplayer because of it. Paradox being Paradox, we know their will be a wealth of DLC, and as much as many may hate that aspect, I'm personally really looking forward to it becuase there is so much growth potential in an already content rich game. If you love the 4x genre, you'll love this.			"

												This was my last game:Fueled by a strong economy and free migration policies, the Democratic Union of Humans (DUH) was the pre-eminent empire that liberated planets from the cruel and tyrranical rule of despotic rulers across the galaxy.  As other empires found that peace was better than war, they established open migration treaties to ensure harmony and cooperation between the empires.  Unfortunately, DUH attracted most of the unwanted populations from other empires and quickly became saddled with heavy social welfare programs to keep everyone happy.  Soon thereafter, the programs proved too expensive to sustain leaving DUH with unhappy and unproductive planets.  The failure cascade accelerated with the failing economy as DUH found it unable to support its military to protect its borders from opportunistic empires and quell internal rebellions for independence.  Sadly, the DUH experiment failed and the very populations that were unhappy with the freedoms they enjoyed found themselves conquered and enslaved... But at least they were happier in the end!  Or purged...Next game I am getting the collectivist trait.			"

												For folks looking for space exploration and empire builders, the 4X crowd, this is your holy grail.  Early game focuses on exploration, charting, and colonization with strong barriers blocking the normal early-game colony rush.  Science and discovery is as important as raw resource might in this phase and adds endless charm and uniqueness to each game.Mid game transitions into one of diplomacy and early warfare as you and your neighbors establish a pecking order.  Exploration still occurs but the sites are dwindling by this point.Late game moves into vast empires and federations staking claims and rearranging neighborhoods all over slights big and small.Add to this late game crises (extra-dimensional invaders for example), relic ancient empires vastly beyond your starting capacity, nascent and emerging low-tech races, and a rewarding tech system you have a game that breathes fun and freshness in every play through.Personally, this is what I've been waiting for nearly 20 years.It was worth the wait.  And even more so now with the post-release improvements!			"

You can have a small number of core systems (4-5) that you need to micromanage throughout the game, but beyond that you need to allocate systems into sectors, under the control of governors. Within a sector all the building is automated, except for warships. You can generally tell a sector to specialise in collecting energy (creds), minerals, research or defence. You can also set empire policies and sector policies that influence how fast your race drifts from the original colonists of your homeworld. This is where the game shines. They automate the micromanagement of individual population units, but you still have to worry non-stop about the politics of your Empire. For example, I uplifted some random animal species and made them intelligent voting members of the Empire. Sects within the Empire popped up centered around the spiritualism of uplifting species, and the animals I uplifted didnt have time to adapt culturally so the became a collectivist entity. One generation later and I have 2 revolts within my Empire happening while I am fighting a war against a robot hive mind. Meanwhile my open migration policy for the last 100 years has caused another sector of my empire to relate more to the bird people Empire than to the humans from Terra, and one system breaks away wanting to be part of an independent protectorate within the Empire. Its well worth checking out. You wont get the cinematic battles of Endless Space, but it is absolutely riveting to play through this game.  "

												The early game of Stellaris is perhaps one of my favorite moments of any game. Creating a new alien species with the detailed Emprie Creation system, sending out science ships to explore and survey the surrounding solar systems, discovering and solving the mysteries of your universe, researching new technologies to vastly change your empire. However in mid-late game things begin to slow down and grow boring, while they attempted to fix this with the Leviathans DLC (which added some interesting new things, I suggest it) the mid-late game is still somewhat bland.

												Grand scale galactic conquest!Fantastic game, but as usual with paradox has some odness in UI. Wish they would polish their UI more before release and do some UX studies. For example, they have the Plus ""+"" for time on the left of the minus ""-"" button. This is simply the opposite that my brain expects. In addition, the pause key is not mapped to ""Pause"" time but instead the space bar is mapped.Anyway, the game may seem complex and difficult do to some short commings on the UX but the game is fantastic.

												""Worthy of the hype."" - Me, just now. I was sceptical of Stellaris. I've tried other 4x games and few of them hit the spot. But Stellaris had me from the start. I think the visuals help - there's not a hexagon in sight! The richness of the scifi is great too - I could roll-play a book I'm reading (Pandoras Star, Peter F Hamilton) and it's reminiscent enough of other SciFi - Ian Banks, Stephen Baxter and so on that I feel like those stories could be taking place in the Stellaris' Universe. It's a slow-paced game but it's not turn based - you can control the speed at which the un-paused game passes so if nothing interesting is happening till you build your next Colony Ship (for example) then you can speed things up - so slow-paced but not boring in the way I found Gal Civ 3 for example. Watch a Let's Play, then get the Galaxy Edition (cdkeys gave the best deal at time of writing) to also enjoy a novel, sound track and other goodies.Top tip - for your first game I'd recommend playing against only minor races till you learn the ropes.

												Most of the negative reviews you will read are based on Stellaris' intitial rushed released. I pre-ordered the game and regreted my decision. It was not finished and deserving of negative reviews.However, since release the developers have put significant effort into improving the base game and offering new content with DLCs. Compared to other 4X games on the market, Stellaris is worth the $40 for the base game. Wait for a sale and pick it up with some extra DLC content for what you would pay for any other 4X title and you will not regret the decision.			"

												(i know it says ive only played 1.7hrs, but ive played on a different account)Honestly a very fun game to play. I've only played singleplayer due to lack of friends who also play it, but even if I did, I'm not sure I would want to. The amount of events and micromanaging you must do in this game makes me feel like it would be a very confusing and time-consuming multiplayer game.In general, a normal game will take you a while to complete, even if you play on the fastest speeds all the time.It has more micro-managing than Civ 5, but it's not nearly as complicated as Hearts of Iron IV.All in all, a very well put together game and I think its a lot of fun to play, if you like games like Civ and Hearts of Iron.

												I love this game, though it took a while to learn since I couldn't find a tutorial, it was so fun. I play this with my friends a lot and still continue to play it as well as try different play styles.Pros:Ship designs looks realistic and really beautiful as well as well thought out.Really fun for any lovers of strategy and anyone who can figure out how to play as the thing that pops up to ask if you want it to explain things to you isn't the best.Great graphics.The music and sound effects fit perfectly and sound great.So much depth and so many different playstyles to choose from.You can customize your own empire according to how you want to play whether you want to be a bit tech savvy, a religious figure of great importance or that one jerk who likes to invade everyones planets right in the beginning of the game.There are so many different types of aliens and enemies and the faction system provides a good challenge.There are so many factions that relate to actual events and they provide an even better enhancement to your game experience.The game is fairly realistic and everything within can be explained luckily so there is no unicorns that blast nuclear jawbreakers from it's booty as much as we all kinda want.Multiplayer is really fun, you can play with other people and even friends.You can be a shroom man..... enough said.The tech tree Cons:The developers thought that by adding this little box in the top right that explains things as you come across them would mean not needing to make a tutorial but it sucks to be honest. It doesnt really explain enything in any real depth and the developers expect you to instantly catch on.You can get a faction called cultists with endgame ships saying they are going to conquer your empire two minutes into the game.One of the ways to win the game is to join a federation of which to join costs -2 influence, though federation gives a lot of perks I would rather there be a penalty if you have a empire that is full of xenophobes or if others in the federation have different values. Rather than influence there should be a penalty for those.The fact that there isnt a single weapon on mining and research stations is kind of annoying because as a base cost it takes -1 energy credit per turn for just one station and now to defend them you need to place defense stations that cost antoher space credit reduction? You also cant even put armor on them so later on about midgame, any ship can one shot them.There really isn't any real materials needed other than energy credits and minerals, which is kind of annoying and restricting.There are materials that boost stats for you if you have a mining station on them but they are otherwise useless.I just want to also point out a lot of time and effort was obviously put into this game and no game is perfect and no dev can truly appease every audience. I would rate this game a 7/10 and would definetly recommend it to anyone who can afford the price XD.			"

												At 54 hours in, I feel like I can properly review this.I don't generally buy full-price games as I tend to sale-shop and find classics that I have missed, but I purchased this at full price primarily due to the commitment and work done on Cities: Skylines and the work allowed by *a publisher* (Paradox Interactive) to do the right thing.  I do distinguish between developers/publishers yet feel that I will give games a bit more runway when Paradox is involved.I will say that thus far, they are performing exactly as I anticipated.  The praise for Stellaris is justified and the praise of the development team being committed is as well.  Paradox continues to allow resources to flow much more steadily toward continued development of a released game instead of simply abandoning the current product for a cash grab on ""Stellaris II"" or being completely focused on paid DLC.With each update the game feels like the team has not only taken feedback but reviewed logs and gameplay stats to tweak the playthrough.  As of the Asimov patch, the mid-game has become more interesting, dynamic and engaging.  I would hazard a guess that we will see some more ""events"" occur to shake up the game with some bit of randomness as things move forward.I will admit, I was tempted to go the new Master of Orion route initially just because I continue to have fond memories of MOO II.  That IP truly defined a genre and the work on the new release is tempting.  But this came down to recognizing that modern gaming is not just about getting it right at release.  It is about sticking around to make the game better even after you've taken your customer's money.  And in the end, that is where I chose Stellaris/Paradox.Game is interesting enough AS IS and playable enough to keep me monkeying with things through several playthroughs.  Updates and potential for additional content just ""appearing"" like in Cities: Skylines (who turned out the lights?  When did it start snowing in here?) due to this being published through Paradox Interactive means I will give it some additional runway.Right now, it is plenty intuitive (although the sector management took me a bit), enjoyable and interesting.  I haven't even started down the road toward some of the other races and philosophies yet.  I also haven't really made to the ""end game"" yet due to earlier missteps/restarts.  However, now with the latest patch I'm engaged more and the combination of game improvements and me simply learning the strategies better is leading this to be a much more enjoyable experience.But don't get too cocky dev team.  I still feel like you could drop in some larger universe-effecting events.  Things that might require a large alliance or research treaties to overcome sooner than your opposition to gain an advantage.  And/or some broader effects of leaders dying or ships being lost to make it more ""personal"" via certain events (e.g. spouse of Captain Smith from Destroyer Devereoux lost at the battle of Apox has gained a following).  And don't think I won't pay for some DLC somewhere along the way, but really, just keep going.			"

												So, basically after 1.5 and with new Utopia DLC Stellaris finally looks decent. Sector AI is bad, but is much better, than 6 months ago and more or less can handle small sectors (do not try to give one sector more than 5 planets - it will develop them extremely slow).Mid-game has been fixed - now it's not so boring anymore and new internal politics stuff (factions, traditions) is nice addition to the game.Now in order to make Stellaris really good game devs need to fix combat system. Doomstacks (and everything tied to them, i.e. 1 lost battle = lost war) must be removed from game.Saying that, now I can actually recommend this game. After a year since launch. :)			"

												I lost my saves, so i'm making another review.The Rakaran Holy Empire was an economic tank, with heavily well-developed systems surrounding it's rich home system. By the time space piracy came, the Rakarans were more than dwarfing the pirates.But then came first contact. Aliens were discovered with a fleet the size of a pirate one. Upon the discovery, the Rakarans attacked the fleet. It was only until they were identified that they were seen as a threat, but also as an opportunity.The Ess'Jaggon Assembly, a giant democracy, was rich. It was full of massive mineral deposits (in comparison), filled to the brim with possible worlds, and, best of all, not capitalized by the Ess'Jaggon. Thus, the Rakarans knew their desires.The 10 Year Space War:The war was declared, and a sudden rush of Rakaran forces hit their frontier station, knocking them back and freeing some of the richest worlds. Moving around the capital's fortified stations, they moved south, deeper inland through their southern enemies. When they come to the system of Ulassia, they bombard the planet of Kraajl. The bombardment was met with no resistance.Then, the Ess'Jaggon attacked. Their first fleet to be thrown at the Rakarans at Kraajl. The first battle of Kraajl, consisting of equal fleets duking it out, was a slim victory for the Rakarans, and a minor setback for the Ess'Jaggon Assembly. Seeing his guard down as the Ess'Jaggon constantly rebuild their fleet stronger and stronger, the God-Emperor Nalarik orders the construction of the 1st Defense Fleet, to make up for the exposed core.But the 1st Defense Fleet would have to act as an escort. The transported armies of the Rakarans would be destroyed and the 1st Corvette Crusaders whom had been the blockade force for Kraajl would have to intervene again in the system, sparking the Second battle of Kraajl.The battle would turn out a slim victory once again, with the numbers of the Corvette Crusaders thin as ever. They would be renamed to the 1st Rakaran Crusaders for their bravery. Meanwhile, the 1st Defense Fleet took a risk, moving quickly whilst a new Ess'Jaggon fleet was rising above, with a military power of 118 whilst the escorts had 175. They had a slim opening of which to push through in, but they arrive. The planet has to be bombarded again.The desperate Ess'Jaggon launched a final attack on the besiegers, making the final battle of the war before the invasions. The Third Battle of Kraajl was a pyyrhic victory. The Rakaran Crusaders, numbering a proud 15 (estimated) corvettes pre-war, was now a measly 3 corvettes, with 85 in military power. The construction of the 2nd Defense Legion (Later to merge with the Rakaran Crusaders post-war) was completed. Though it saw no battle, it would keep the Ess'Jaggon from launching invasions over in the core worlds. An estimated 8-9 years had passed since the declaration of war.During the war, minor skirmishes and outpost raids were occuring, far from the savannas of Kraajl.Months pass. The bombardment is complete, and the armies land on Kraajl. The final battle of the war. The 2nd Transport Fleet had landed. The battle, a decisive victory, marked the surrender of the Ess'Jaggon. The Ess'Jaggon Assembly was no more, with their homeworld, Jaggo, going to the Rakarans, as to where the historic battlefield of Kraajl became it's own independent military dictatorship. The war, beginning in 2214, ends in 2224.4.15, 10 years later, with a victory for the Rakaran Holy Empire.2 years later, with the rising rebellion in Jaggo striking constantly, the collapse of the colony of Bysh III and Jaggo occured. Starvation plagued the colonies, even briefly in Rakaras. Though the economy was stable, the production itself wasn't.But yet, all would be well. The establishment of governors and the creation of hydroponic farms would help.But then....The Jhabbanid Horde War: From the east emerged a corporation, XenoCorp, which would prove vital, for the West had a massive threat that wasn't checked by the Rakarans, the Sovereign Jhabbanid Union.Four worlds full of Jhabbanids, odd Arthropoid scientists with their established Science Directorate. This directorate, seeing the exploitable weakness that plagued the Rakarans almost three years after the war, declared their own war, attempting to sieze the colonies and humiliate the Rakarans. The Rakarans thought that they would be fine in this war, until a force of 1,000 military power poured out from the western border system of Yirba. Quickly they moved to Bysh, past the homeworld of Rakaras, remeniscent of the tactics used by the Rakarans themselves in the 10 Year Space War,  and bombarded the colony of Bysh III with fierce speed. The Rakarans were in for a major fight.The Rakaran Crusaders were numbered at a mere 300, the 1st Defense fleet at 175. Seeing the excess wealth of Energy Credits, the Rakarans decided to trade for Minerals at XenoCorp to create a quick fleet that would halt the attackers. This would take longer than imagined. Yet the colonies were secured with numerous armies that would safeguard the colonies from major attack. The race of time began.The Rakarans couldn't even push in their lands, for a border force of 1,000 power held it. They could only work with XenoCorp, sit tight in their homeland, and count their blessings. The Rakarans would not back down.The Rakarans hastily increased the military power of the Rakaran Crusaders, now having a military power in the 640's. But it wasn't enough. Who knows what could be forged behind the closed doors of Yirba.To be continued...WILL UPDATE AS I PLAY			"

												""From the Sun comes Life. From Life comes Death. From Death comes the Dust. From the Dust is born a new Sun. Such is will of Anaar, that which is all and none, the beginning and end, the Watcher of Creation and Chaos. In its unending dream may we find purpose. In its fearful shadow may we spread throughout the cosmos."" -Excerpt from the Book of Ntuloak, Holy Text of the Anaari.Okay, so there is my little contribution to the science fiction atmosphere of this surprisingly deep game. Stellaris is a Grand Strategy game. Unlike other strategy games involving squads of soldiers flung at the opposing team's base, Stellaris puts you in the shoes (figuratively speaking) of the ruler of species in cosmic space. From there, you will be in charge of growing your civilization throught the galaxy. Whether this is by scientific discovery, spiritual diplomacy, or militaristic conquest, the choice is yours for how you choose to rule the stars. Stellaris has a rather steep learning curve. Expect to have several playthroughs before finally finding a government type that suits your tastes. I personally chose the egalitarian and xenophile approach (I am a nice person, can't help it). They might be digitized pixels, but I prefer to be on the good side of cosmic entities. There is a considerable amount of resource management to Stellaris; do not expect the game to be fast-paced. A great deal of patience is required for a successful playthrough. The fascinating thing about Stellaris is that it is much like a black hole; by the time you realize you are being pulled in, it has already consumed you. The game offers a rich, storytelling experience in the same skein as Sunless Sea, where the story develops as a constantly evolving narrative. Your culture does not stagnate. The research options available, coupled with the anomalous events in space, can have drastic and sometimes dire consequences depending upon the choices you make. Stellaris is a fascinating mixture of space sim, empire builder, resource management, and civics simulator.  If you are a fan of wandering through the stars and creating your own story amidst breathtaking beauty, it is definitely worth the purchase. See you in Space!			"

												After over 300+ hours of play time I can review this game properly.The game itself is a Space RTS, which I know a lot of people go ""meh"" but, this one ain't bad trust me.Pros:Lots of quest! After 300+ hours i am still finding new quest I haven't seen before.The ability to customize your race of space peeps is really awesome. lots of room to play around even without mods.Hours, an hours of conquest and diplomacy in game. Sometimes you have to pick your battles an sometimes its better to bite your lip an lose a world or 2 than lose everything. UP TO 30 MAN MULITPLAYER GAMES! so sick of 5v5 RTS games being the max.The Game is accessable to mods on the steam workshop! MAKE THE GAME HOW YOU WANT! (anime girls for everyone!)Cons:The AI imo is dumb as rocks, Def. subscribe to a mod to increase the AI difficulty. If you don't, usually what happens is. After you beat the AI's main fleet, it usually just spams you with 1 man fleets OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. It never really recovers to try and ""re-Fleet"" to fight you again.Multiplayer is Peer to Peer, THIS IS THE ONE HUGE LETDOWN of mulitplayer. Getting the right host is everything. An getting a host to stay and keep the game up after he/she has died is another issue all together. Host PC crashes too bad game over. MABYE! someone will rehost the save game....mabye...an mabye! SOME people might rejoin you. Most just tend to start a new game. After playing 4+ hours into a game its beyond annoying. This game NEEDED! servers for this kind of mulitiplayer.Exclusive Races not avaliable in game or through DLC unless you bought one of the more expensive versions of the game. Its a great game it really is but its not worth $70.00 to make sure you have some extra outfits for your race / all new races. I mean the normal version without any of that is already $40.00. (the one i bought btw) Even the $50.00 one is a bit of a stretch. I would get the normal version an wait for some DLC to come out for those races / outifts which most games tend to. Pay $5.00 in DLC to recive the extras is more reasonable imo.Over all great game 8/10. Def. love the space empire domination an the fact I can mod it up hard core just adds to the already hundreds of hours of gameplay. Its a must have for RTS fan's an space nerds alike.			"

												I love this game, though it took a while to learn since I couldn't find a tutorial, it was so fun. I play this with my friends a lot and still continue to play it as well as try different play styles.Pros:Ship designs looks realistic and really beautiful as well as well thought out.Really fun for any lovers of strategy and anyone who can figure out how to play as the thing that pops up to ask if you want it to explain things to you isn't the best.Great graphics.The music and sound effects fit perfectly and sound great.So much depth and so many different playstyles to choose from.You can customize your own empire according to how you want to play whether you want to be a bit tech savvy, a religious figure of great importance or that one jerk who likes to invade everyones planets right in the beginning of the game.There are so many different types of aliens and enemies and the faction system provides a good challenge.There are so many factions that relate to actual events and they provide an even better enhancement to your game experience.The game is fairly realistic and everything within can be explained luckily so there is no unicorns that blast nuclear jawbreakers from it's booty as much as we all kinda want.Multiplayer is really fun, you can play with other people and even friends.You can be a shroom man..... enough said.The tech tree Cons:The developers thought that by adding this little box in the top right that explains things as you come across them would mean not needing to make a tutorial but it sucks to be honest. It doesnt really explain enything in any real depth and the developers expect you to instantly catch on.You can get a faction called cultists with endgame ships saying they are going to conquer your empire two minutes into the game.One of the ways to win the game is to join a federation of which to join costs -2 influence, though federation gives a lot of perks I would rather there be a penalty if you have a empire that is full of xenophobes or if others in the federation have different values. Rather than influence there should be a penalty for those.The fact that there isnt a single weapon on mining and research stations is kind of annoying because as a base cost it takes -1 energy credit per turn for just one station and now to defend them you need to place defense stations that cost antoher space credit reduction? You also cant even put armor on them so later on about midgame, any ship can one shot them.There really isn't any real materials needed other than energy credits and minerals, which is kind of annoying and restricting.There are materials that boost stats for you if you have a mining station on them but they are otherwise useless.I just want to also point out a lot of time and effort was obviously put into this game and no game is perfect and no dev can truly appease every audience. I would rate this game a 7/10 and would definetly recommend it to anyone who can afford the price XD.			"

												Brand new favourite. Great game with a few balancing issues which i'm sure will be ironed out/have been fixed with updates. Already some great mods out that improve the gameplay further.EDIT: Balancing issues fixed more or less so that there is a greater variety of viable weapons choices, each with their own specialiaztion. The extra content the Dev's have pumped in with every update has been fantastic and the DLC is worth it.The beginning of the game can be a bit slow and tedious but once the game gets going the different forms of government and ethics you have affect the way the game plays greatly to ensure you never play the same game twice.A fairly approachable game for a 4x setting but by no means simple, awesome game 10/10 would reccommend			"

												(i know it says ive only played 1.7hrs, but ive played on a different account)Honestly a very fun game to play. I've only played singleplayer due to lack of friends who also play it, but even if I did, I'm not sure I would want to. The amount of events and micromanaging you must do in this game makes me feel like it would be a very confusing and time-consuming multiplayer game.In general, a normal game will take you a while to complete, even if you play on the fastest speeds all the time.It has more micro-managing than Civ 5, but it's not nearly as complicated as Hearts of Iron IV.All in all, a very well put together game and I think its a lot of fun to play, if you like games like Civ and Hearts of Iron.

												This game is really great! It's like a realtime Civ game but in space, without tiles. Mid game gets kind of shaky, but overall its a good experince. The devs are pretty cool too! Every month or two a new update is added and it usually involves changes to gameplay that the community requested. 7/10 but will be higher with future expansions.			"

												Stellaris is a great game! It has a fair amount of replayability and its graphics are amazing! Although the gameplay at times is confusing and there is a relatively steep learning curve, it should be expected with any Paradox Interactive game. I defiantly recommend this to anyone who has played other empire-building Paradox games or other strategy games along the same lines. I rate it a 9 out of 10!			"

												With the new update I feel like I have to update my review of this game. It was really good. Now It's awesome.Earlier Stellaris had a mid to late game problem, basicly you could get in a situation where all you did was waiting for the money to roll in so you could wipe out all resistance in the galaxy and be done with it. It felt like the best part was over. Now however, the events just keep comming. The wars are challenging (Play on hard) and there's so many paths for my empire to go. We have a good modding comunity and the developers really listens to the players when it come to updates. It IS the best 4X game i've played and the cheer amount of wierd stuff that can happen is great. My only regret is that all my friends are fps stick in the muds that doesnt understand the greatness of the Blorg.Buy this game. :)			"

												The race designer is fantastic, offering plenty of different ways of exploring and dominating the galaxy. The early game exploration phase is brilliant and to be honest, doesn't really need any serious improvements with plenty of interesting events and quest chains. The moment where you meet your first alien civilisation never gets old, will they be friends or arch enemies? The mid-game is where things get a little bit stale, with the diplomacy and politics being rather shallow. However, I still find them enjoyable and there is plenty of room to make it better later on down the line. The AI is an area of weakness. Usually its competent but on occasions it can be incredibly stupid. Fortunately, Paradox are releasing a patch to fix the more serious flaws soon. There are definitely bugs, although I personally have yet to find a serious or game breaking one. At the moment the game is definitely lacking depth in places, but I'm still having a hell of a time and would recommend anyone who has even a vague interest to give this game a go.			"

												Best 4X/Strategy game ive ever played.  Makes the recently released reboot of Master of Orion look like child's play.  The amount of detail in each every every star, planet, ship is incredible.  The costumization is at least 100 times better in every way possible than similar games.  The race costumization alone is well worth the price.  Here when you create a HUGE galaxy to play in you ACTUALLY get HUGE.  We're talking over 1000 star systems with 5-10 various stellar bodies in each. And on top of that you can populate the galaxy with 39 other randomly generated species to play against! How amazing is that?? Compare that to the new Master of Orion where a HUGE galazy is only 100 star systems at best and only 7 other species to play against.  Just an astounding game on every level.

												Stellaris is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to Stellaris. Adams quotes aside, the game is pretty good. There's fun to be had in creating an empire, in the early-game space exploration, and in most aspects of the game. Unfortunately, an unforunate amount of the mid-late game time is filled with busywork or nothing at all, but speeding up the game can help things along quite a bit. The AI Diplomacy leaves something to be desired, for example some empire might reject your Non-Agression Pact because it's ""Not Diplomatically Relevant"" which somehow manages to appear in just about every situation, near, far, big, small, worried, peaceful, it will show up and say ""No, no diplomacy for you."" tl;drGame is pretty good, but overpriced. Wait for a sale if you like this sort of gameplay and don't mind a little bit of busywork between the exciting things that happen. I expect this game will get better with time, the diplomacy will be more intuitive, bugs will be patched out, so the older this review gets, the more likely it is that the issues with the game will become history.

												The early game of Stellaris is perhaps one of my favorite moments of any game. Creating a new alien species with the detailed Emprie Creation system, sending out science ships to explore and survey the surrounding solar systems, discovering and solving the mysteries of your universe, researching new technologies to vastly change your empire. However in mid-late game things begin to slow down and grow boring, while they attempted to fix this with the Leviathans DLC (which added some interesting new things, I suggest it) the mid-late game is still somewhat bland.

												Grand scale galactic conquest!Fantastic game, but as usual with paradox has some odness in UI. Wish they would polish their UI more before release and do some UX studies. For example, they have the Plus ""+"" for time on the left of the minus ""-"" button. This is simply the opposite that my brain expects. In addition, the pause key is not mapped to ""Pause"" time but instead the space bar is mapped.Anyway, the game may seem complex and difficult do to some short commings on the UX but the game is fantastic.

												""Worthy of the hype."" - Me, just now. I was sceptical of Stellaris. I've tried other 4x games and few of them hit the spot. But Stellaris had me from the start. I think the visuals help - there's not a hexagon in sight! The richness of the scifi is great too - I could roll-play a book I'm reading (Pandoras Star, Peter F Hamilton) and it's reminiscent enough of other SciFi - Ian Banks, Stephen Baxter and so on that I feel like those stories could be taking place in the Stellaris' Universe. It's a slow-paced game but it's not turn based - you can control the speed at which the un-paused game passes so if nothing interesting is happening till you build your next Colony Ship (for example) then you can speed things up - so slow-paced but not boring in the way I found Gal Civ 3 for example. Watch a Let's Play, then get the Galaxy Edition (cdkeys gave the best deal at time of writing) to also enjoy a novel, sound track and other goodies.Top tip - for your first game I'd recommend playing against only minor races till you learn the ropes.

												Most of the negative reviews you will read are based on Stellaris' intitial rushed released. I pre-ordered the game and regreted my decision. It was not finished and deserving of negative reviews.However, since release the developers have put significant effort into improving the base game and offering new content with DLCs. Compared to other 4X games on the market, Stellaris is worth the $40 for the base game. Wait for a sale and pick it up with some extra DLC content for what you would pay for any other 4X title and you will not regret the decision.			"

Future patches and DLCs will definitely make the game even better. I would like to see more creatures that are not carbon-based (like gaseous or even spiritual). Now all the playable civilizations seem to be derived from creatures on Earth(fox,cockroach, jellyfish etc), it will be cool if we can choose something totally...unexpected.			"

For $40 you're really getting a lot for your money and the game developers are constantly providing updates on the game. I would definitely recommend the standard edition to anyone who is trying to get into this genre.Currently as is, the game is a solid 7/10. But Paradox Interactive has been really good on improving, receiving feedback and updating the game so with improvements and updates, it could easily be a high 8/10 or 9/10.			"

Quests and stories are interesting but not vey involving and have little to no consequences.Science tree is odd, and sometime you do not get very important techologies such as planet terraformation and this pretty much halts your development and can cost you the entire gameThe battles are rather boring and uninteresting, this is not necessarily bad as you have much more stuff to do meanwhileDoing new ship designs is rather tedious and better left for automation, not much fun in doing it yourself especially in multiplayer.

												While there are currently some glaring issues in the game, such as the lack of mid game content, Stellaris still manages to completely enthrall me with it's wonderful early game and the massive amount of freedom it gives the player. The events and situations your empire is thrust into are unique and provide plenty of opertunity for roleplay. The empire creation is, in my opinion, one the best things about Stellaris. I've spent hours on end just making civilizations and developing their culture and morals. Most of the problems the game currently faces can be fixed by the mods and I believe that in time Stellaris will be fixed and the upcoming expansions will add the mid-late game content this game sorely needs.

												Firstly, i should note that I've played the majority of Paradox's releases and I think this one is the only one which does not have a steep learning curve (and also features a decent tutorial). So is it a little too simplified? Well if you compare it to Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings ant the like, it sure is. But this decision is not wrong, because in that way the game is closer, regarding gameplay) to such classics as Master of Orion 2 and Galactic Civilizations. Thumbs up by me!			"

												-Addicting space strategy opera-This seems like the Galatic Civilisation 2-successor I wanted except it's real-time with pause.For the new player: Stellaris plays much like civilization in space including the dreaded ""just-one-more-turn-phenomenon"".Features:Exploration, expansion, extermination (optional) or cultural/diplomatic win.Different ethics highly change your playstyle e.g. with xenophobe you only get mean first contact hails to select. In democracies the boss is selected among your leaders which mixes your staff around and so on.Context sensitive random event and crisis system, large scale galactic threat events.You can add planets to sectors under AI control so you don't have to micromanage your large empire. Indeed you have a cap for solitary planets.Game is highly modable.Space looks nice.No performance problems or crashes for me.-minor bad things-There's an extensive tutorial but many conccepts are still cloudy (on the other hand there's also a wiki built-in)Some UI bugs and fighting with the controls and finding infos. Try to uplift a species for example. Pause is your friend here.If you play a lot events become repetative but more will be added later I guess.It could be even weirder but then I'm also reading Rhodan so take that with a grain of salt.-mixed feelings-Games really depend on your neighbors and where you start as you're never far ahead in the tech/power race in this game even in ""normal"".If you want achievements you'll have to play ironman (only one autosave slot).Death and ruin can come quickly in space. You will take losses of beloved admirals and beautiful worlds. I personally rage quit after an ""ally"" snatched a key planet away with a colony ship only 3 seconds ahead of my own colony ship.My best admiral started taking drugs then died ahead of her time.TLDR; you can buy that, it's good.

												After over 300+ hours of play time I can review this game properly.The game itself is a Space RTS, which I know a lot of people go ""meh"" but, this one ain't bad trust me.Pros:Lots of quest! After 300+ hours i am still finding new quest I haven't seen before.The ability to customize your race of space peeps is really awesome. lots of room to play around even without mods.Hours, an hours of conquest and diplomacy in game. Sometimes you have to pick your battles an sometimes its better to bite your lip an lose a world or 2 than lose everything. UP TO 30 MAN MULITPLAYER GAMES! so sick of 5v5 RTS games being the max.The Game is accessable to mods on the steam workshop! MAKE THE GAME HOW YOU WANT! (anime girls for everyone!)Cons:The AI imo is dumb as rocks, Def. subscribe to a mod to increase the AI difficulty. If you don't, usually what happens is. After you beat the AI's main fleet, it usually just spams you with 1 man fleets OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. It never really recovers to try and ""re-Fleet"" to fight you again.Multiplayer is Peer to Peer, THIS IS THE ONE HUGE LETDOWN of mulitplayer. Getting the right host is everything. An getting a host to stay and keep the game up after he/she has died is another issue all together. Host PC crashes too bad game over. MABYE! someone will rehost the save game....mabye...an mabye! SOME people might rejoin you. Most just tend to start a new game. After playing 4+ hours into a game its beyond annoying. This game NEEDED! servers for this kind of mulitiplayer.Exclusive Races not avaliable in game or through DLC unless you bought one of the more expensive versions of the game. Its a great game it really is but its not worth $70.00 to make sure you have some extra outfits for your race / all new races. I mean the normal version without any of that is already $40.00. (the one i bought btw) Even the $50.00 one is a bit of a stretch. I would get the normal version an wait for some DLC to come out for those races / outifts which most games tend to. Pay $5.00 in DLC to recive the extras is more reasonable imo.Over all great game 8/10. Def. love the space empire domination an the fact I can mod it up hard core just adds to the already hundreds of hours of gameplay. Its a must have for RTS fan's an space nerds alike.			"

												Im going to tell you right now; early game content is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. People have actually posted valid complaints about this game, but let me tell you, this game is worth it. I can feel the huge potential for this game, and with the free patches coming up in May/June/July, mid-game should get a huge polishing, and hopefully late-game lag is fixed, but this game unravels a story around your choices and your ethos, so each playthrough is a story you could actually write a decent novel out of. Add mid-game colonial events and factions, and you got yourself a space opera spanning systems and borders, with deadly threats within and without. Beware the robot slaves.			"

Posted: January 3
												Oh boy, here we go...War score system:      Forcing you to play within the limitation of the war goal and also Capping the War score at 100 is stupid and illogical. We are essentially limiting a pan-galactic empire to the rules of some primitive feudal state. All this does is it artificially slows down the game by forcing wars to last centuries instead of a few years. Let us ignore the obvious thematic and logical issues of this design choice and just look at mechanics: This system works somewhat well when you are nothing but a couple of fledgling empires slugging it out in the local clusters, but once you have a large alliance or federation it becomes incredibly frustrating to play with. Here are some obvious ones: If you have more than 4 allies, it is almost impossible to make war against someone as most planets are worth ~20 warscore apiece.Diplomacy:    This simply isn't fleshed out enough, there are no meaningful interaction between empires beyond the most simplistic ground rules (Alliance, enemies, rivals etc.). There isn't even a gifting/tribute system! I can give my allies a million credits/minerals and they will still not like me one bit better than if I did not. This also makes relationships relatively permanent outside of some trite predetermined 'diplomatic actions' like insult or rivalry. I can conquer the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of someone and as long as I don't personally keep any of the loot, they won't even bat an eye a year later.Technology Tree:     There is no real way to influence which tech you get beyond memorizing the arcane multiplication table between researcher traits and the various gain rates. It makes zero thematic sense that the overlord of an empire cannot tell its researchers to put more effort into an area. I don't necessarily want a guaranteed chance, but at least give me a way to throw credits/influence to increase the probability of one of the techs showing up. I had the misfortune in my last game to be surrounded by 20+ arid planets but could not find the colonization tech to take them until well into the mid-late game. Incredibly frustrating, makes little logical sense and makes the game random in such a way that is unfun. It is entirely possible to have your race spawn in a corner of the galaxy without any naturally colonizable planets and then never get the colonization techs. This ends the game without you ever making a mistake..Technological Growth/Research:     The time it takes to research a tech is increased by the number of pop you have in your empire. Logically, this is the OPPOSITE of what should happen in real life as more people tend to produce more scientists with more chances of discovering things. From a design point of view, this decision to tie population with tech only serves to punish players who prefer to be expansionist or who are aggressive early on. You have a technological edge if you have a small focused empire, since technology has no real limit in this game, this eventually just becomes a tax on every player. Thus, the only mechanical result of this design is to slow down games to a crawl. AI, as usual, does not appear to have this problem. It is also possible that their natural 'cheats' to research rate overcomes this in large part. In the last game I played, the larger enemies actually out tech'd me at a faster rate than the smaller ones (I'm behind even the smallest empire, even though I have every single one of my 122 planets focused on research).As a direct consequence of you always being technologically inferior to most of your rivals, you simply cannot allow a game to last longer than a century or so. The '5% tech' that you get at the end of the tech tree means that AI empires will infinitely out-scale you and eventually will overcome even the largest of industrial capacity disparities.Strategic Combat:    There is no consequence in letting a fleet rampaging through your sectors. There is no concept of 'defending your territory'. Economic damage is almost irrelevant and even holding planets does not accomplish much at all. This is a huge problem when you are fighting large empires (30-40 planets or more) as fighting becomes tedious and inconsequential. This is especially true if you have hundreds of planets in the late game of large galaxies. The only objective that matters are the enemy's fleets and your only real war goal is to kill their big fleet stacks. If the AI raids a dozen of your planets but you nail his fleet, then you win. Period. Even if the warscore is -99%, you will still get your planets back as long as your fleet survives and his doesn't.There isn't' really a way to prevent a fleet from running through your systems either: Defensive stations tend to be pathetically weak compared to ships, they are also extremely expensive and difficult to stack. This leads to enemy AI sending dozens of tiny raiding parties into your territory, murdering everything they can get their hands on. Especially once they get jumpdrive tech. The only way to ensure victory against AI is to cluster your shipyards in one or two systems, put ALL of your defenses in those stations and always have a fleet nearby to protect it. The rest of your empire literally does not matter. As long as you have production capabilities, you will win every war. In fact, having as little assets outside of those few production sectors is key in not losing the war as you will still lose warscore by losing small and inconsequential space battles.If there is a single optimal way to win the strategic game, then your design is fundamentally flawed. This is compounded by the fact that AI excels at performing annoying but not game-winning actions.End game Crisis:   This is only a crisis for you, Ai doesn't apparently care about any of the big galaxy ending events. You can't even tell your ally fleet to follow into combat against any of them, nor will they react diplomatically in anyway. I had my ally declaring multiple wars(or had rivals declaring wars on me even as they are being eaten alive by the threat) while I'm trying to deal with these events and nearly cost the game for me.Sectors(Flaw/bug): AI governors are dumb as bricks. At the same time, Sector automation is indispensable in this game. I've seen AI filling up planets with +23 food when the pop is already full (or even when the pop doesn't consume food, like synths and robots). Telling them to focus on a specific thing or telling them to respect tiles only seem to work some of the time. Very little work seems to have gone into making the sectors actually work properly.Strategically, the segregation between sector space assets and core world assets is also very annoying. You can't really tell sectors to produce ships because it becomes a nightmare to micro them without them showing up in the sidebar. This actually changes how one plays the game because warfleets are difficult/impossible to produce in non-core worlds and your production ends up being limited to how many core planets you possess. This becomes enormously problematic once your empire gets large - in large or gigantic maps, you can't produce ships fast enough to fight a 100+ planet empire because the AI apparently does NOT have this problem with user interface and micromanagement.This is just some of the things I noticed in my prelim play throughs. There are other things that I do not agree with but did not include because they are preference related. TL;DRStellaris is a really amazing 4x game and I think it has built the right foundations for one of the most amazing strategy games of all time. However, there are many questionable design choices in the game that I feel limits strategic variety or pidgeonholes the player in some illogical way. I for one am glad that paradox is embracing the modding community as it will take a tremendous amount of support from them to make this game truly meet its potential.			"

It felt like the best part was over. Now however, the events just keep comming. The wars are challenging (Play on hard) and there's so many paths for my empire to go. We have a good modding comunity and the developers really listens to the players when it come to updates. It IS the best 4X game i've played and the cheer amount of wierd stuff that can happen is great. My only regret is that all my friends are fps stick in the muds that doesnt understand the greatness of the Blorg.Buy this game. :)			"

												I don't know if I have enough experience (12 hours so far) but I can just say, game is great! Has some flaws like too peaceful AI that will not attack you as long as you have any fleet to threaten them. Also the influence resource is too slow making the mid game where we explore very slow (but I took it as a plus). I am also not sure about the idea of sectors, at one point they might be great since we can have up 1k stars in the galaxy, but its not really smart and cuts our micro managment to up to 5 planets and our fleet (also they dont produce ships and we still have to do it, from our income!) But I believe that most of these flaws can be repaired and even now its still worth to buy it!			"

I mean game breaking and literal game crashing. Granted this started for me around 450 planets under my ownership, more ships than all Fallen Empires combined, and a over 1500 pop with like 20 species. It can be annoying but understandable that it will have a bug at start. Though they have already stated they are working on it so likely gonna be fixed soon.			"

												23 hours into a game I never though I would be so addicted to. The last strategy game I actually played was the beginning of the Total War series when I was young. I usually play FPS or MOBAs so me enjoying this game is saying a lot. This game is getting a lot of hype and the only real reason I bought it was because it is the #1 game on Top Sellers and I had 40$ to blow. The last game I bought for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles was ARK, and man was that like the crack to my needle. I think this game could be my new crack.It took me my beginning 12 hours (yesterday)  to figure out why I had made 8 different races and why they had been annihilated. Whether your a prospective buyer of this game or just a new player reading reviews while you empire gets analed like mine I highly suggest to keep trying different things if you get frustrated with the anal.Seriously if your looking for a game to enjoy and be addicted to by spending hours trying to figure out what the hell is going on.

A lot of details went into the descriptions of events, the options you have to interact with primitive civilisations, what kind of government you are, etc.Only real critique point I have is that the AI that can autoupdate your fleet is dumb as hell and that the game could explain better how the weapons and defenses for the ships work: the fleet combat is a lot trickier than it initially seems.

												The race designer is fantastic, offering plenty of different ways of exploring and dominating the galaxy. The early game exploration phase is brilliant and to be honest, doesn't really need any serious improvements with plenty of interesting events and quest chains. The moment where you meet your first alien civilisation never gets old, will they be friends or arch enemies? The mid-game is where things get a little bit stale, with the diplomacy and politics being rather shallow. However, I still find them enjoyable and there is plenty of room to make it better later on down the line. The AI is an area of weakness. Usually its competent but on occasions it can be incredibly stupid. Fortunately, Paradox are releasing a patch to fix the more serious flaws soon. There are definitely bugs, although I personally have yet to find a serious or game breaking one. At the moment the game is definitely lacking depth in places, but I'm still having a hell of a time and would recommend anyone who has even a vague interest to give this game a go.			"

												Best 4X/Strategy game ive ever played.  Makes the recently released reboot of Master of Orion look like child's play.  The amount of detail in each every every star, planet, ship is incredible.  The costumization is at least 100 times better in every way possible than similar games.  The race costumization alone is well worth the price.  Here when you create a HUGE galaxy to play in you ACTUALLY get HUGE.  We're talking over 1000 star systems with 5-10 various stellar bodies in each. And on top of that you can populate the galaxy with 39 other randomly generated species to play against! How amazing is that?? Compare that to the new Master of Orion where a HUGE galazy is only 100 star systems at best and only 7 other species to play against.  Just an astounding game on every level.

(You like Star Wars Empire?, There's a MOD for all the battlecruisers, you like new technologies available?, there's a MOD for it, you want a MOD that would fix the bugs of the game?, there's one for it. You want *insert here whatever you think it can be modded in the game*, there's already a MOD for that... and if it doesn't exist... it's a Paradox game... so... you do it.			"

												Stellaris is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to Stellaris. Adams quotes aside, the game is pretty good. There's fun to be had in creating an empire, in the early-game space exploration, and in most aspects of the game. Unfortunately, an unforunate amount of the mid-late game time is filled with busywork or nothing at all, but speeding up the game can help things along quite a bit. The AI Diplomacy leaves something to be desired, for example some empire might reject your Non-Agression Pact because it's ""Not Diplomatically Relevant"" which somehow manages to appear in just about every situation, near, far, big, small, worried, peaceful, it will show up and say ""No, no diplomacy for you."" tl;drGame is pretty good, but overpriced. Wait for a sale if you like this sort of gameplay and don't mind a little bit of busywork between the exciting things that happen. I expect this game will get better with time, the diplomacy will be more intuitive, bugs will be patched out, so the older this review gets, the more likely it is that the issues with the game will become history.

												Lacking in features that they probably held out on to release as DLC. There is a decent chance I will get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and make this review negative after they make me pay a lot more money to make this game awesome.I still really like it though.EDIT 1:I feel the need to point out I have never had any issue with the sector AI. The sectors have always been very useful in working for me.EDIT 2: We are currently at the tipping point between a positive and negative review, I think.			"

												This is what 4x games were meant to be.200 hours in, restarted twice in the first 15 hours to learn the game.Learning curve is a downside... but there is A LOT to learn.Micro and macro at its finest.Diplomacy that has been severly lacking in most 4x games is well executed here.Dont know what else to say really... I'm in love and will play this well past 2000 hoursand im not even sure if theres multiplayer yet, i havent checked!			"

												Stellaris is a strategy game unlike any other. I became instantly hooked on this game and was very surprised on how fluid every thing feels. I was a little hesitant when going to play this due to the fact that the strategy games I normally play are hearts of iron and wargame but I was completely blown away at how amazing this game is. With super in-depth customization of the races and components with in the game it’s a strategy gamers dream.11/9			"

												It's very hard not to just type 'OMG...IT'S FREAKIN' AMAZING!'....But I won't (of course!).As someone who has loved 4X Space games but always wanted to go into a more empire controlling late-game & someone who has loved the IDEA of getting into EU4 but found the learning-curve too steep to get past....Stellaris has provided all I've wished for and more.While not a direct comparison in genre, Stellaris is the first game to capture that day-long space stratedgy bliss I got from Star Trek: Birth of the Federation. The 4X/Slow based beginnings eases you into the game and the mid-late game eases in allowing for a smooth learning experience helped by the in-game advisor.If a more in-dept 4x game is something you've craved then this is a must. If the idea of a Paradox game daunts you, know that it means a deep end-game without the learning curve and future support rarely seen from other developers....oh yeah and the soundtrack is phenomenal!

												I cautiously recommend it. It's a good game, but it has some features that people might not like.The negatives:Highly depends on RNG. I do not usually call it a negative, but the only events that matter have negative influence on the wellbeing of your empire: if you are not prepared, it's a game over. As these particular events - yes, I'm talking about crisises - happen in late game, all your progress becomes nullified, which sometimes can be rather annoying. Customisation is wast, yet is restricted. You have to choose the presents, not the bonuses directly, which in my opinion could push the customisation to it's glorious limits.Wars are not great. You can't control directly your fleet. Conquering the planes is a redundant mini-game that slows you down - simply because you use soldiers only when you have won all the space battles and is bombing the plants' fortification - taking them without bombing is 75 times harder for armies.AI is weird, just like in your usual strategy game of this genre.Yes, this is a positive review. The game itself is good and easily enjoyable. It has something that was making you to make that 'one more turn' in Civilization games.			"

I can only imagine the glory of using mankind as a means of transportation in this brave new world. My only serious rival... a race of cunning indivualist fox people. They had spread far and wide, yet followed a pacifist sort of belief system and in the end were no match.Super-duper/10 would totally hunt down all of the foxes as a military junta of horse-people again.

												One of my dream games! I'm a Sci-Fi fanatic & this game lets me live out and role play whatever I want. Obviously if you compare it to EU IV or CK2 it has less content but there's still a ton and i'm sure I'm gonna have a ton of fun for hundreds of hours. It's constantly being updated and expanded with a ton of free content & changes in patches rolling out every 1-2 months (last changelog 1.3 had 16 pages). DLC is well priced too. Plus in multiplayer if your friends don't have DLC and you do, everyone receives it for the duration of the game! There's mod support so if you want to play in a Star Trek, Star Wars or any other universe there's probably a mod for that. If you love Sci-Fi you should really try it.			"

I would definitely recommend the standard edition to anyone who is trying to get into this genre.Currently as is, the game is a solid 7/10.

												A good game with great potentials. The baseline is there, but it needs improvemnts. Pros:- Good technology development idea (Semi-random cards).- Atmosphere. - Government types, edicts, ethos and its effects on empire level.- Preferred planet types.- Ship designs. Cons:- Fights involves no tactics, just bigger and better designed army wins.- Species does not vary one from another (Biggest let down for me), all use same tech tree, same approaches. - Leader limits, but why. (Makes no sense, if I have proper economy, I should be able to hire as many as I want)- Tech is mostly for army level, not good improvements are introduced for society level, and the ones for society does not affect enough. Neutral:- Sections. (AI does fair job but sometimes I want to control those planets)I think it is a good game, but can be much more.  "

												Original: The game can be difficult if you do not look at the pacts or allies; declaring war on the wrong person may get you many enemies. I love the games depth. I learned how to manager sectors late in the game but was much easier to manage a lot of the area with sectors. I love the game. The UI could use some work to support high resolution and remove scrolling. I would recommend this to people who love slow paced strategies.Update 01NOV16:After finishing my first game with only hyperlane travel; I lost because I attacked the wrong empire that was stuck in my space who happened to be allied with some superior races. It was fun even though I lost. Seems to be alot of strategy on when and how to attack others. Time to start game two with Warp Drives only. After that Wormholes only.			"

												My first Steam Review on my first 4x game (seems quite fitting).   I'll start off with a TL;DR...if you want a quality game with both beautiful audio and visuals, which also includes fun gameplay with massive replayability, just buy this now.   I was a little nervous when I first started the game.  Never having played a game in the genre before, I wanted to win!  I started/re-started two games of about 30 minutes each, just to get the hang of basic functions.  Third time was the charm and as of this writing, I'm about 20-some-odd hours into my first true play through.  I realized quite quickly that it didn't really matter if I won or not as a beginner...the journey is just so much fun.   I'm playing fairly conservatively, just looking out for my peoples and not ruffling any feathers.  I have not been into any battles with any other species but have amassed enough territory, resources, and a strong enough fleet that I am more powerful than many of the species that dislike me.  I am also friendly with over half of all of the advanced species, so I feel like I could easily gain support if I need it.   Regardless of how it all plays out, I am looking forward to either continuing to victory or to my next play through.  With so many choices to make due to the options provided, my next ""warlike"" tribe will decimate all who oppose me.  Then religious zealots who will convert everyone into happiness.  After getting comfortable with a few different playstyles, it'll be multiplayer time, where I can try my hand with non-AI counterparts.  I absolutely love this game, and I'm glad that I took the chance on it.  You should take the chance as well.   If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my ramblings.  I don't know how this compares to other games in the genre, but I can whole heartedly recommend this to anyone who loves video games, has a bit of imagination, patience, and is ready for an amazing adventure.  Easy to pick up, hard to put down (I now know the ""one more turn"" mentality), this game is downright spectacular!			"

												This game is vanilla at best in its unmodified form, but add some of the mods for it and it becomes an excellent 4x. Not too complicated but also not to remedial to lose its charm. Late game can become very system draining; still it has enough to it, especially modified to make many replays enjoyable and unique. This propels the entertainment value to a much higher degree and makes the game worth the money. Paradox should thank the modding community as they have made their mediocre product a more polished gem.			"

												This is definitely one of the best games I've ever played. However it would be nice if it were remotely possible that I could win. After a month of solid gaming I have come to feel frustrated that I have no hope of victory in this game. They could have made it a bit easier for dumbasses like me.			"

												This is a good game but it definitly needs a lot of work. Sometimes the end game crisises bug out and you're stuck with the everlasting invaders that do nothing. Another complaint is that the whole galaxy doesn't care about th invaders. Now after you've sorted all that out there are only two ways to win: Dominate the whole galaxy or control 40% of all planets. There aren't many passive options for pacifist empires or spiritual empires. Don't get me wrong, in my first playthrough I was a pacifist empire and I loved playing it, but once you research all the technologies and defeat the evil hordes of end game enemies you just have to integrate your vassals and colonize whatever planets are left to get the domination victory. Overall its a good game, needs a lot of work though. Buy it if you want to, but I suggest waiting three or four updates. The one major thing that does bug me is the inly two victory conditions. I suggest Victory conditions based on your empure's ethics and government type. NEED MORE VICTORY CONDITIONS!!!!!!!			"

												Wow, this game is what Civilization: Beyond Earth should have been! It combines the best parts of Civ 5 strategy and merges them seamlessly with a serious amount of conquest. I am 4 hours in and have already met 2 dangerous enemies, investigated and colonized several solar systems, and started to build up my military force. I expect the net four hours to be dominated by war and conquest as I butt heads with my aggressive neighbors. There is a lot of detail in this game and it has a high learning curve, but that makes it all the more fun. The in-game help and narration is essential to getting off to a good start.Totally recommend this game!			"

												THE BEST SPACE STRATEGY GAME AROUND.I've been playing Stellaris for some time now and around 40 hours and I'm still totally engrossed by it. The game is beautifal, and epic is scale. The early game is brilliant, exploring the local star systems and gaining resources to boost your research and production. The mid to late game consists of building your race to a level were no one and nothing can touch you, but its easier said than done. The game is very challenging but not impossible and keeps asking questions of you throughout. I could easily play this game for a long time to come without getting bored for me its the best Space based grand strategy game ever and maybe with the new DLC one of the best strategy games ever. Easily better than the annoying Gal Civ III and Endless space.I highly recommend it you anyone who likes space or strategy or both. Its truely one of the best games I've palyed in a long long time.10/10 And I don't give high marks often.			"

												After so many disappointments, especially regarding these high priced games that aren't even finished properly, it was genuinely refreshing to see a company come along that actually gives a ♥♥♥♥ about providing content to the gamers that buy their games.This game seem to play out very much like Sins of a solar empire, except without the silly superpowers and abilities that the ships get and it's on a much more massive scale with more intricate 4x style empire management. What's great though is it doesn't have the 4x turn based play and is all real-time so you don't have hideously long wait times for a turn to happen. I thought that would be overwhelming at first as I suck at micro-management, but because you can tweak the speed whenever you like and pause things to issue commands it's all very friendly to the more casual players.The diplomacy isn't completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like most of these empire management games, the AI actually seems to follow a set of logic and I've managed to make some friends. I chose materialistic and fanatical individual, I also chose direct democracy, so I had an easy time allying with likeminded races once I started exploring and finding other empires.The galaxy map is also pretty nice along with all the artwork they've put in, the map reminds me a lot of those custom made maps of EVE Online if you've ever seen them on the internet where they actually have the alliance borders and symbols plastered all over 0.0 space. Except of course in this game, it's actually fun to play and go to war or use diplomacy with the various factions.			"

You start out as a weak fledgeling nation your goal is to rise to an unparralled empire and concur the galaxy. Speaking of empires you have tons of choices for what gov type you are.

If you want to control the army in the field like in Total War, don't play this game. Play Total War. If you want to manage an empire from the top down, play this game.

												What I, a Filthy Casual, thinks:The last sci-fi strategy game I played was Galactic Civilizations III and this game is similar but with a lot more depth (and this game hasn't even been out as long right now so there are a host of free updates and expansion packs to look forward to). This review is not aimed at hardcore strategy players who are looking for their next tactical fix.+ Many species designs for your aesthestic pleasure+ Mix and match a variety government types + A choice of galaxy sizes & shapes (blob/spiral arm/ring)+ Pre-space age planets (not other empires) that can be probed, enslaved or enlightened+ Make a fleet! Name the fleet! Name the ships! Name the Admiral! SEND IT TO WAR!+ Rename all the stars you own to goofy names and stupid references 'cos why not+ Micromanage EVERYTHING unlike real-life where you have no control+ Make sectors when your empire gets too big and micromanaging becomes a chore+ Optional pop-up missions (plotlines!) with various rewards+ A burgeoning modding community to add extra flavour+ Involved developers offering updates and new content in the future!- Limited tutorial, no in-game help- Can modify weapons on ships but cannot alter appearance like in GalCiv III- Diplomacy (pacifist) options limited and not fun. Can't make friends easily like in Civilization- Seriously, why do all my neighbouring empires hate me?! THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.- For scaredy cats: cannot avoid hostiles early in-game (no option to turn them off)- For impatient people: cannot hammer out a game in a day like in CivilizationWord to the one sitting on the fence:If you've never played a 4X or grand strategy game before, or are a Filthy Casual like me, this game does kind of throw you into the deep end a little. The game isn't turn-based, it runs time like The Sims with pause, slow, faster options (recommended: pause when making decisions and reading stuff). Anyway, don't feel scared to potter around in a couple false starts games in order to get to grips with the game mechanics before you look up a few Beginner's Tutorials. From there on, when you encounter something you need more information, there is a really helpful community and forum archive available full of answers.If you're not afraid of time sinks, love exploring, love building and managing empires, and have the patience to play the long game then this game is definitely worth it (it's not even that expensive).

												Stellaris is an amazing video game, and in some ways its the grand space civ i've always wanted. I wish managing leaders and your government was a bit more involved because right now there is a lack of interesting decisions to make in the mid game. In its current state (1.2) the amount of random events (similar to FTL) is too small, and I see the same ones around the same time in every new playthrough. Adding a ton of new events and political intrigue (like Crusader Kings 2) could really spice things up, and I'd be more than willing to pay for them as DLC because the management part of this game is fantastic.

												This is probably gonna be one of my first serious reveiws so excuse me if its not that good.Anways its a good game but it feels like it lacks some content Not enough options with the ai multiplayer was buggy (at least for me when i tried to talk it brought up all the hotkey menus) it should have more events also maybe more weapon types and ship types also.one of my first paradox games but i love it i would love to see more content added.7/10 over all played 97.8 hours in 6 days (wow i still though it was the second)has some bugs that need to be worked out and some issues with lag in game (fps are fine its a different type of lag)good game. check it out on youtude before you buy to see if you would like it maybe only 2-3 episodes there is enough content already it wont spoil much.

												Stellaris is a fun game, at least for me.It has it's issues but the devs have been actively working on quality of life and bug fixing updates and it couldn't make me happier. They've taken a lot of community input when it comes to balancing and other small things.My only gripe is that the game is really intensive resource wise late game. Due to just the sheer size of your fleets, empire and neighboring empire's fleets the game slows down a LOT. Battles that'd take less than a minute had it been just 25 destroyers quickly turn into 5-10 minute slug fests ending in one side attempting to flee and being caught by the chasers or a fleet being destroyed.End game Victory conditions are also a bit lack luster with the two Conditions being, get rid of every other empire or colonize a majority of the Galaxies planets. There's also a massive mid game slog, but if you can push through it all and are dead set on conquering the galaxy this game is for you.			"

												I love this game.  I love how it changes as you grow through it.  Things that don't seem very useful early become very important later, things you thought you didn't need anymore you suddenly do again.  Things are changing and growing, and roles are shifting.Example:  Construction ships:  You've built all the mining platforms you can, but instead of being pointless, now you can build defensive platforms with them, which weren't available early on. The game seems to be full of that.   "

												Stellaris is a 4X space game, with great real time space fleet battle mechanics. i very much enjoyed expanding out my empire, managing the planets, forming federations, and watching massive space battles.If you enjoy space 4X games, this is a must buy, or if you enjoy 4X in general this is a great pick up!Stellaris also has steam workshop enabled, allowing for some great mods, everything from custome skins, to changing gameplay.9/10			"

												After so many disappointments, especially regarding these high priced games that aren't even finished properly, it was genuinely refreshing to see a company come along that actually gives a ♥♥♥♥ about providing content to the gamers that buy their games.This game seem to play out very much like Sins of a solar empire, except without the silly superpowers and abilities that the ships get and it's on a much more massive scale with more intricate 4x style empire management. What's great though is it doesn't have the 4x turn based play and is all real-time so you don't have hideously long wait times for a turn to happen. I thought that would be overwhelming at first as I suck at micro-management, but because you can tweak the speed whenever you like and pause things to issue commands it's all very friendly to the more casual players.The diplomacy isn't completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like most of these empire management games, the AI actually seems to follow a set of logic and I've managed to make some friends. I chose materialistic and fanatical individual, I also chose direct democracy, so I had an easy time allying with likeminded races once I started exploring and finding other empires.The galaxy map is also pretty nice along with all the artwork they've put in, the map reminds me a lot of those custom made maps of EVE Online if you've ever seen them on the internet where they actually have the alliance borders and symbols plastered all over 0.0 space. Except of course in this game, it's actually fun to play and go to war or use diplomacy with the various factions.			"

Posted: May 20, 2016
												This early impression (given its a paradox title) is aimed specificly at fans of EU IV (as I am) wondering whether they should get stellaris. Please bear in mind that this is no full review of stellaris.The game starts out much more like a civilization game than an EU game. You start with a singular solar system, scout you surroundings, meet enemies and neighbors, build mines to collect resources and send out colonists to expand your empire. Sounds familiar? You also develop technologies along a tech tree, have random events and kill pirates (think barbarians). Even the classification of your race (spiritual, industrious, militaristic, pacifistic ...) reminds me strongly of civ IVs classification of leaders.Now, I am not saying this is civ in space. However playing stellaris to me has a lot more in common with said titles as any paradox title I know. It starts out pretty simple and straight forward. You start on your own and for the first years you are pretty much expanding without much trouble. After all, your competitors are more or less on your level of power, technology and resources. The amount of micro management grows proportionately to your empires size, which means after a while you'll be busy managing all those planets. Eventually you'll get into conflict with a neighbor who, depending on your play style, may have little more or less military power than you.The point is, that this is a pretty fair game. Everyone starts the race more or less equal and your success largely depends on your system mastery. Even the fact that success is a thing (I dare you to define success in EU IV) makes a massive difference. There are traditional win states such as ""have the largest empire"" or ""kill everyone else"".EU IV in contrast is a completely unfair game. Whether you start as mighty France or little Albania (if you're insane), the game is never balanced. Some nations are doomed from the beginning and making it to the year 1821 for them is a major achievement. Other nations might strive for world domination.I like stellaris and I'm sure I'll get my money's worth out of it. But for me something is lost in the balanced race to supremacy. EU can be impenetrable with its interface and its complex systems. It can be cry out loud harsh when apparently out of nowhere an alliance rises against you. But setting my own goals, playing as a super power or a tiny monastery fighting against the odds is what keeps EU interesting to me. I don't see how stellaris can do the same.I hope these impressions help to set expectations for the game correctly. I will update this text if I find that I was wrong or have further remarks.			"

Easily the successor to MoO's crown, Stellaris does each 'X' better and deeper then any other game on the market.As an aside there have been some critical reviews going around the internet and altough I will be the first to admit the game has several flaws and shortcomings, it still blows away any 4x competition and because this is Paradox, this is just the start as DLCs and patches roll out over the coming years to provide additional depth and fixes, this game will quickly grow beyond anything else in the genre.

The UI is elegant beyond belief and almost perfectly intuitive.  Finally, sometime this decade, someone releases a game that is essentially finished on release, does not require a manual or boring tutorial and gives you that ""just five more minutes"" feeling that got me addicted to video games in the first place.  OK, come to think of it, you are evil Paradox -- now I'm a gamer for another decade.			"

												Most of the negative reviews you will read are based on Stellaris' intitial rushed released. I pre-ordered the game and regreted my decision. It was not finished and deserving of negative reviews.However, since release the developers have put significant effort into improving the base game and offering new content with DLCs. Compared to other 4X games on the market, Stellaris is worth the $40 for the base game. Wait for a sale and pick it up with some extra DLC content for what you would pay for any other 4X title and you will not regret the decision.			"

The fallen empire was my neighbor that was one of the 8 neighbors i had note i had 5 planets, so 8 neighbors (out of the total of 10 and 2 fallens) was a bit much. after they cleasned my 3 planets they left me alone and everyone else and after i was attacked over and over for 10 years or 3 hours intill i was cleansed and note this was ""easy difficulty"" or the easiest you can get 10 empires, no strong neighbors and no endgame crisis all in all,  dont play ironman so you can do 1 cheat and have some fun :-: 9/10 to long fot normal players			"

												If you're more of fan of historical Paradox strategy games like Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings, or Hearts of Iron, I would highly recommend downloading an overhaul mod that sets the game in a sci-fi universe, like Star Wars, Star Trek, Mass Effect, et cetera. This makes the geopolitics at game start more dynamic and asymetrical, just like other Paradox games.If, however, you're more of a space 4x fan and like games like Masters of Orion, Imperium Galactica, or Sword of the Stars, I'd recommend setting the number of civilizations in your galaxy to about 80% of the recommended value, because otherwise it ends up feeling like there is very little time or space to enjoy the explore phase of Stellaris.Essentially, it feels to me like Stellaris is trying to be both types of games simultaneously, but falls short a little bit of the hype and its goals in its initial design. I guarentee though, that with the numerous inevitable expansions, it will undoubtedly improve tremendously.Either way, it is an enjoyable game in its own right, even if it won't be able to fill the Masters of Orion shaped hole in our lives.

Looking forward to squishing all the squishies and squashies before taking down that Federation. Maybe even finally take down the Fallen Empire I've been stuck next to all game. I still remember the day they made me burn ten colonies for their own amusement.Serious respect to the ten or so colony empire that actually pushed me off their homeworld, though, even if they had powerful friends helping.I bought Stellaris Full-Price and it's totally worth it, even if they weren't updating it.

The main reason I recommended this at all is because I love paradox games and know with time this game will only become better. People say when you hit your lowest point the only way to go is up. Well that's stellaris. It's low point is already miles ahead of other games, and still has so much room to grow. If you like previous games by paradox and don't mind the DLC, get it.

												There are many issues with this game, but holy crap it's been a long time since I've played a game for 12 hours straight on my first session.  Issues aside, this is a great game that will get better with a little love from the devs.Some of the issues I've noticed are:-Mid game border cluster♥♥♥♥s where you can't really interact with people you don't have a border with.  (Without getting military access to space that lies inbetween you, the devs have stated they are working on this.)-Mediocre Ai that are great in some areas and terrible in others. (Ai are also too passive in some situations and highly predictable from a diplomatic POV.)-Lack of any form of major diplomatic UI such as color coding alliances, Ai's opinion of other factions, ect.-Too few victory conditions?  (This is more my personal opinion, just look at how many ways you can win in Civ)-Lack of internal/external trading.There are certainly a few more, but I believe these are the major points.All in all, I've put nearly 60 hours into a game that was released just under 2 weeks ago.  The UI is pretty good in most areas, and it was surprisingly easy to pick up when compared to Paradox's other games.  I've thoroughly enjoyed this game so far and I can't wait to see what future updates and expansions are on their way.			"

As Paradox has stated, they will continue to patch the game and add new content in the future IF enough people play and buy the game. If you don't like the game now, maybe you will like it later. I look forward to experiencing this game for many years to come!			"

												Good game crippled by a bad UI.  A lot of things 4X players would expect to see such as auto-explore options for scout ships weren't even in at launch.  The planet/sector management interface is sorely lacking in sorting options.  There is no interface to view potentially colonizable planets, and the only way to do so is by hovering over the galaxy map looing for green planet icons that disappear if you zoom too far out.That said, the events and race designs are really well done, though the AI seems to balk at the eXpand portion of the 4x genre.  Almost 200 years into a playthrough there were still a LOT of habitable planets on the edge of the galaxy that were sitting uncolonized.  The endgame threats are cool though, and I'm looking forward to what the game will look like in 3-6 months with some TLC centered on the mid game lull and UI shortcomings.			"

												IF you are as old as me, you can appreciate when I say, this game brings me back to the pure joy, and occasionally the frustration, I had when I played the ORIGINAL Sid Meier's Civilization back in 1991 -- that's 25 years ago!I remember playing Civ back then, not realizing how much time had passed, and how how quickly it passed, all because this GAME swept you up in its wonderful 4x mechanics -- and that's what I'm reliving now with Stellaris.  Sure, it's got a few flaws, but between patches and mods, you can fix or tweek just about anything you might find to complain about.So this isn't so much of a technical review, as it's much more of a thank you to Paradox for bringing that feeling back -- bravo, folks, bravo!

												I've been enjoying Stellaris a lot so far, but I have a few issues with it:+Epic Scale, the largest galaxies can have 1000 Star Systems, each with multiple planets+Beautiful Graphics, the battles look great, weapon effects and sounds are good for the most part+Customization of Species traits, Government, Appearance, Names etc.+Ship design, a very user friendly ship design+Multiple interesting events and locations to explore+Different FTL systems that really change how you play and explore the Galaxy+Long term epic strategy, you can take a species that you discover on a planet from Iron Age tech up to eventually be assimilated into your Empire as an equal member-species (It takes a long time, but I've done it!)-Limit of 5 planets (Initially, can be increased through tech) that you directly manage. You have to create 'sectors' to control more. The AI that manages you sectors really sucks, I had to take a system out of a sector and manage it myself for a while then put it back it as the AI wasn't doing anything I asked it to do. I supplied the sector with plenty of resources to build up those planets within its control.-No tech tree, you get a draw of 3 techs to research (initially, you receive more through exploring and tech upgrades) It makes it hard to plan out what tech you want to research initially, but with further play this might be less of an issue-limited trade with other species, I had a surplus of energy and shortage of minerals, but I couldn't trade away my surplus fast enough to supplement my mineral requirements. The AI usually wants to have a better deal than you are getting otherwise it will reject it. Also, sometimes they won't even trade with you despite you giving them a huge advantage, they still feel insulted that you offered them that deal??-AI for enemies sucks because they all hate you for going for the win conditions. Its really annoying actually.			"

												I love this game, though it took a while to learn since I couldn't find a tutorial, it was so fun. I play this with my friends a lot and still continue to play it as well as try different play styles.Pros:Ship designs looks realistic and really beautiful as well as well thought out.Really fun for any lovers of strategy and anyone who can figure out how to play as the thing that pops up to ask if you want it to explain things to you isn't the best.Great graphics.The music and sound effects fit perfectly and sound great.So much depth and so many different playstyles to choose from.You can customize your own empire according to how you want to play whether you want to be a bit tech savvy, a religious figure of great importance or that one jerk who likes to invade everyones planets right in the beginning of the game.There are so many different types of aliens and enemies and the faction system provides a good challenge.There are so many factions that relate to actual events and they provide an even better enhancement to your game experience.The game is fairly realistic and everything within can be explained luckily so there is no unicorns that blast nuclear jawbreakers from it's booty as much as we all kinda want.Multiplayer is really fun, you can play with other people and even friends.You can be a shroom man..... enough said.The tech tree Cons:The developers thought that by adding this little box in the top right that explains things as you come across them would mean not needing to make a tutorial but it sucks to be honest. It doesnt really explain enything in any real depth and the developers expect you to instantly catch on.You can get a faction called cultists with endgame ships saying they are going to conquer your empire two minutes into the game.One of the ways to win the game is to join a federation of which to join costs -2 influence, though federation gives a lot of perks I would rather there be a penalty if you have a empire that is full of xenophobes or if others in the federation have different values. Rather than influence there should be a penalty for those.The fact that there isnt a single weapon on mining and research stations is kind of annoying because as a base cost it takes -1 energy credit per turn for just one station and now to defend them you need to place defense stations that cost antoher space credit reduction? You also cant even put armor on them so later on about midgame, any ship can one shot them.There really isn't any real materials needed other than energy credits and minerals, which is kind of annoying and restricting.There are materials that boost stats for you if you have a mining station on them but they are otherwise useless.I just want to also point out a lot of time and effort was obviously put into this game and no game is perfect and no dev can truly appease every audience. I would rate this game a 7/10 and would definetly recommend it to anyone who can afford the price XD.			"

Every month or two a new update is added and it usually involves changes to gameplay that the community requested. 7/10 but will be higher with future expansions.			"

Although the gameplay at times is confusing and there is a relatively steep learning curve, it should be expected with any Paradox Interactive game.

												""From the Sun comes Life. From Life comes Death. From Death comes the Dust. From the Dust is born a new Sun. Such is will of Anaar, that which is all and none, the beginning and end, the Watcher of Creation and Chaos. In its unending dream may we find purpose. In its fearful shadow may we spread throughout the cosmos."" -Excerpt from the Book of Ntuloak, Holy Text of the Anaari.Okay, so there is my little contribution to the science fiction atmosphere of this surprisingly deep game. Stellaris is a Grand Strategy game. Unlike other strategy games involving squads of soldiers flung at the opposing team's base, Stellaris puts you in the shoes (figuratively speaking) of the ruler of species in cosmic space. From there, you will be in charge of growing your civilization throught the galaxy. Whether this is by scientific discovery, spiritual diplomacy, or militaristic conquest, the choice is yours for how you choose to rule the stars. Stellaris has a rather steep learning curve. Expect to have several playthroughs before finally finding a government type that suits your tastes. I personally chose the egalitarian and xenophile approach (I am a nice person, can't help it). They might be digitized pixels, but I prefer to be on the good side of cosmic entities. There is a considerable amount of resource management to Stellaris; do not expect the game to be fast-paced. A great deal of patience is required for a successful playthrough. The fascinating thing about Stellaris is that it is much like a black hole; by the time you realize you are being pulled in, it has already consumed you. The game offers a rich, storytelling experience in the same skein as Sunless Sea, where the story develops as a constantly evolving narrative. Your culture does not stagnate. The research options available, coupled with the anomalous events in space, can have drastic and sometimes dire consequences depending upon the choices you make. Stellaris is a fascinating mixture of space sim, empire builder, resource management, and civics simulator.  If you are a fan of wandering through the stars and creating your own story amidst breathtaking beauty, it is definitely worth the purchase. See you in Space!			"

												I lost my saves, so i'm making another review.The Rakaran Holy Empire was an economic tank, with heavily well-developed systems surrounding it's rich home system. By the time space piracy came, the Rakarans were more than dwarfing the pirates.But then came first contact. Aliens were discovered with a fleet the size of a pirate one. Upon the discovery, the Rakarans attacked the fleet. It was only until they were identified that they were seen as a threat, but also as an opportunity.The Ess'Jaggon Assembly, a giant democracy, was rich. It was full of massive mineral deposits (in comparison), filled to the brim with possible worlds, and, best of all, not capitalized by the Ess'Jaggon. Thus, the Rakarans knew their desires.The 10 Year Space War:The war was declared, and a sudden rush of Rakaran forces hit their frontier station, knocking them back and freeing some of the richest worlds. Moving around the capital's fortified stations, they moved south, deeper inland through their southern enemies. When they come to the system of Ulassia, they bombard the planet of Kraajl. The bombardment was met with no resistance.Then, the Ess'Jaggon attacked. Their first fleet to be thrown at the Rakarans at Kraajl. The first battle of Kraajl, consisting of equal fleets duking it out, was a slim victory for the Rakarans, and a minor setback for the Ess'Jaggon Assembly. Seeing his guard down as the Ess'Jaggon constantly rebuild their fleet stronger and stronger, the God-Emperor Nalarik orders the construction of the 1st Defense Fleet, to make up for the exposed core.But the 1st Defense Fleet would have to act as an escort. The transported armies of the Rakarans would be destroyed and the 1st Corvette Crusaders whom had been the blockade force for Kraajl would have to intervene again in the system, sparking the Second battle of Kraajl.The battle would turn out a slim victory once again, with the numbers of the Corvette Crusaders thin as ever. They would be renamed to the 1st Rakaran Crusaders for their bravery. Meanwhile, the 1st Defense Fleet took a risk, moving quickly whilst a new Ess'Jaggon fleet was rising above, with a military power of 118 whilst the escorts had 175. They had a slim opening of which to push through in, but they arrive. The planet has to be bombarded again.The desperate Ess'Jaggon launched a final attack on the besiegers, making the final battle of the war before the invasions. The Third Battle of Kraajl was a pyyrhic victory. The Rakaran Crusaders, numbering a proud 15 (estimated) corvettes pre-war, was now a measly 3 corvettes, with 85 in military power. The construction of the 2nd Defense Legion (Later to merge with the Rakaran Crusaders post-war) was completed. Though it saw no battle, it would keep the Ess'Jaggon from launching invasions over in the core worlds. An estimated 8-9 years had passed since the declaration of war.During the war, minor skirmishes and outpost raids were occuring, far from the savannas of Kraajl.Months pass. The bombardment is complete, and the armies land on Kraajl. The final battle of the war. The 2nd Transport Fleet had landed. The battle, a decisive victory, marked the surrender of the Ess'Jaggon. The Ess'Jaggon Assembly was no more, with their homeworld, Jaggo, going to the Rakarans, as to where the historic battlefield of Kraajl became it's own independent military dictatorship. The war, beginning in 2214, ends in 2224.4.15, 10 years later, with a victory for the Rakaran Holy Empire.2 years later, with the rising rebellion in Jaggo striking constantly, the collapse of the colony of Bysh III and Jaggo occured. Starvation plagued the colonies, even briefly in Rakaras. Though the economy was stable, the production itself wasn't.But yet, all would be well. The establishment of governors and the creation of hydroponic farms would help.But then....The Jhabbanid Horde War: From the east emerged a corporation, XenoCorp, which would prove vital, for the West had a massive threat that wasn't checked by the Rakarans, the Sovereign Jhabbanid Union.Four worlds full of Jhabbanids, odd Arthropoid scientists with their established Science Directorate. This directorate, seeing the exploitable weakness that plagued the Rakarans almost three years after the war, declared their own war, attempting to sieze the colonies and humiliate the Rakarans. The Rakarans thought that they would be fine in this war, until a force of 1,000 military power poured out from the western border system of Yirba. Quickly they moved to Bysh, past the homeworld of Rakaras, remeniscent of the tactics used by the Rakarans themselves in the 10 Year Space War,  and bombarded the colony of Bysh III with fierce speed. The Rakarans were in for a major fight.The Rakaran Crusaders were numbered at a mere 300, the 1st Defense fleet at 175. Seeing the excess wealth of Energy Credits, the Rakarans decided to trade for Minerals at XenoCorp to create a quick fleet that would halt the attackers. This would take longer than imagined. Yet the colonies were secured with numerous armies that would safeguard the colonies from major attack. The race of time began.The Rakarans couldn't even push in their lands, for a border force of 1,000 power held it. They could only work with XenoCorp, sit tight in their homeland, and count their blessings. The Rakarans would not back down.The Rakarans hastily increased the military power of the Rakaran Crusaders, now having a military power in the 640's. But it wasn't enough. Who knows what could be forged behind the closed doors of Yirba.To be continued...WILL UPDATE AS I PLAY			"

												I've logged quite a few hours on this title already, and I'm already anticipating many many more to come.Personally, I love the game.  It has (almost) everything I want in a 4x space game; heavy emphasis on early game exploration, event chains emulating my favorite sci-fi tropes, and big gnarly space ships blasting the crap out of each other. The domestic and foreign politics systems are a bit thin for what I was expecting from paradox, but I imagine that will flesh out in time.  Even stripped down, the government and diplomatic options are still far and away more sophisticated then the usual 4X space fare I've seen in the last 10 years (with the exception of Distant Worlds).  In fact, Stellaris reminds me of one of my favorite games from the 4x genre: the Space Empires series.  Just with updated graphics, real time / pause, and a dash of the usual paradox stuff.Stellaris does what it does very well, and it's firmly rooted in the 4X genre.  If you are expecting it to be more complex and fiddly like other paradox titles, or a soap opera simulator like CK2....well it definitely isn't either of those things.  It has less in common w/ other paradox titles than it does with 4x games like Civ, Galactic Empires, or Endless Space.  The fussy micromanagement stuff isn't there yet, but it seems like more of the more complicated systems will be added over time with patches and expansions. The AI, whether working for you or against you, needs some work.  The sector system feels artificial and isn't especially well explained.  It doesn't feel organic.  The faction system feels bare bones.  Diplomacy does what you would expect from a 4x, but there could be more done with it.  From what I've seen combat systems could be expanded on, especially fighters/bombers and capital ship effectiveness.  Even with that, I absolutely recommend the game for space fans, 4x fans, and strategy fans in general.  It hits just enough of the right notes to make me feel like I'm participating in a sci fi story of my own.  For me everything else is just details.			"

Paradox is known for their immense support of their products, so expects this to change and evolve into something much more than it is, now that they have a mass of users for input. As is, its still a solid game. Not all I want it to be yet, but, I enjoy it much, and supporting paradox is the right thing to do.			"

												An absolutely amazing space 4X game that brings some new twists and life to the genre. Before I go on, know that there are some issues with the game as it is now. Late game ends up a bit lacking, and the interface needs some work. Diplomatic communication and AI needs a small upgrade too. BUT, don't think the game is unplayable if these things worry you. If you pick up this game, my advice to you, is grab your favorite sci-fi, and roleplay it. This game is unprecedented on the feeling it gives you as the leader of your empire. It IS your empire, and it IS your guys that are being badass. It's kinda hard to put it in words, but you are going to end up immersed and that familiar ""One more turn"" feeling that sucks you down the rabbit hole, will hit you HARD. As it is now, this game is one of my all time favorites, right up there with the classics, and it's only going to get better. Paradox has always had extensive support with updates and fantastic DLC after launch. And you can mod this game with the same fervor you mod Skyrim, just waiting on those total conversion mods, yum. So yes. Recommended with high marks.  "

												Personally, I haven't been this engrossed in a 4X style game since Moo2, Alpha Centauri, or Civ 4.Stellaris does an amazing thing - it lets you weave a story, and its primary concern is the immersion of the player in the world it's created.

												Without a doubt the most impressive 4X game I've ever played. Never in my time playing various iterations of the Civilization franchise, Command & Conquer, Age of Empires, or any other similar title have I encountered a more difficult AI. Playing this game on the most simplistic difficulty setting will still leave you racking your brain for the solutions that left you with all these problems. A single misstep in the beginning of the campaign will come back to haunt you with detrimental catastrophe so much farther along in the campaign that you have no hope of figuring out what that crucial mistake could have been. I was floored by the delightfully complex need to micromanage everything all the way down to the planetary level. Even when getting to the point of a campaign in which it becomes necessary to establish sectors within your galactic empire, one must still monitor the growth of people as well as their political opinions and agendas. A magnificent title that I would recommend on sale, at full price, or even at a higher dollar value. What a marvelous game. Truly.Five Stars			"

												I'm in the middle of my first playthrough still, with basic Humans. Already like it a lot. The empire-building is well thought out, exploration is very engaging and rewarding, the style and design are nearly perfect. I like the balance between war and exploration, the details of world colonization, research and ship management. Resources are made interesting again here, by the way, as they all behave in different ways and you need to maintain their flow by taking different measures for each (I mean credits, minerals, influence, strategic resources). It looks and feels like a near-perfect space 4X game to me, although I've never played any other game of that type, coming to this one after CK2 and Civs.There are some mildly boring things though. Firstly, I've not noticed yet any differences in Species, game-wise. I mean they all have different traits and affinities, but beyond preferring certain climates otherwise they behave similarly. Even in diplomacy the difference between species and ideologies converts to just simple liking/disliking. Then, to make it better for non-warlike players, perhaps other victory conditions could be added, Civ-style, and then I think many would appreciate more nuanced diplomacy and sector management (like ordering your Governor to address certain issues first or to pursue a certain policy beyond basic resource extraction). Also the border instability should be explained somewhere in a tutorial. Your territory expands and contracts slightly all the time, depending on how active your planets are, and this came as a minor surprise.			"

												By far my favorite 4X game I've ever played. There are so many random occurrences and unforseeable possibilities with each game (not to mention multiplayer) that it's completely impossible to play anywhere near the same game twice. What I found really fun when I first started playing is seeing all the other empires form around me and peeking over at them to see what they were doing right. Kind of like cheating on a test. That meant that after I inevitably went bankrupt while waking the sleeping bear by attacking someone's vassal, I could then use everything I'd learnt and build on it from the start.Even during my second playthrough when I'd had a really strong grasp on how things worked and the tactics involved in keeping up with your peers, I still found myself at the mercy of my neighbors and their impressions of me. Suddenly the empire east of me wouldn't hear me out at all and started encroaching on my borders en masse. It made me have to rethink my entire strategy and declare war on the smaller friendly empire to the west. This allowed me to expand further in that direction and buy myself time while I caught up in naval superiority to my easterly rivals (although I felt dirty for crushing those poor colonies).Naturally, the whole cold war between myself and the other was rendered a moot point when I researched Jump Warp Drives that accidentally tore a portal open in the fabric of spacetime and unleashed a bunch of ethereal beings onto the galaxy. Proceeded to completely eat up my neighbor and my empires both. BUT IT WAS ENJOYABLE.Onto game #3, using my previous two empires as templates for some of the AI so I can face myself in a way haha. During each game you pick different traits for your species and different policies for your empire so you wind up playing differently anyway, no matter how well you know the game. First time around I was a military dictatorship, second time around an individualist democracy and now I'm going for a materialistic logician oligarchy of sorts, all of which play entirely differently and massively dictate how the game molds to you.Long winded, anecdotal ""review"", sorry about that, but hopefully the genuine satisfaction I get from this game comes through. As of writing this I'm at 29 hrs played and I got it less than 2 days ago :3			"

												I've got some reservations recommending this game, but I can't hit that thumbs down button because it's entertaining for at least one hundred hours before you start noticing it coming apart at the seams. I'm reviewing version 1.5.1 and all the DLC available as of April 2017. This game will continue to be updated, so hopefully the issues I'm about to list will be addressed.Stellaris is a sci-fi 4x game. It may perhaps be THE sci-fi 4x game. It covers very many angles of science fiction, you can re-create almost any sci-fi scenario in Stellaris. If it's not available in the base game, it's probably in a DLC or someone's modded it in. If you like galactic-scale science fiction and/or 4x games, you're going to like this game.Pros:+ Good soundtrack of space music. You don't know what space music is? It's this kind of stuff.+ Sound effects are good. Nothing too outstanding here, but it's appropriate.+ A lot of love went into the graphics for the stellar bodies, and it's soothing to watch pulsars or black holes or planets spin on their axis.+ Good writing. Since most events and diplomacy are conveyed through writing, this is good. You can ignore it if you hate reading, but you'll miss out on the feel of being part of a novel.+ Strong early game with lots of exploration events.+ Lots of attention to detail everywhere.Meh:? Notable lack of graphics for a lot of in-game events, or a small number of still images are re-used. Don't expect unique art every time something happens, but to compensate a lot of stuff seems to happen.? Endgame is a bit nebulous (hah). One of several end-game events that will happen if you have the setting turned on, and these are alright. There's some fun end-game shenanigans you can do with genetic manipulation or building mega-structures, but by the time you get to them, you'll already either won or lost.Cons:- Graphics engine chugs during the endgame with lots of on-screen ships.- Emaciated middle. I hope you're ready to put the game on the fastest speed and just churn though technologies while you micromanage your holdings and build up a blob fleet of death. Slightly alleviated with the Leviathans DLC, but it's not enough.- Diplomacy is almost nonexistent.- Federations (large alliances) are a huge waste of time thanks to the way the AI flounders with the federation fleet.- No espionage or intrigue between empires. You can infiltrate pre-FTL worlds, but empires can't touch each other.- The game attempts to discourage you from micromanaging your planets and heavily penalizes you if you go over your Core World limit, but the sector AI that you're supposed to use instead is inscrutable and dumb. This ironically results in more and more frustrating micromanagement.- Space combat consists entirely of throwing as large a fleet as possible at the enemy. There are no tactics, there are no formations, just balls of death. - Ground combat is even worse because it's also a blob, but you don't even see the lasers and missiles, just numbers and HP bars on a screen.- War in general is a slog due to how demands work. It can take several wars with a 10-year truce between to conquer or eradicate an enemy, because the game won't allow you to take more from the enemy than it deems fit.- Tall empires are not feasible because by the time you research the technologies that allow construction of tall empires you've already lost because of the huge disadvantage you have of spending the first two thirds of the game as a small empire.- Despite all the different aliens feeling different because of appearance and ethical attitudes, they all have the same weapons on their ships, they all have the same hydroponic farms, and they all have the same mining stations.That looks like a lot of cons, huh? Well, there's a lot of other mechanics that do work and will keep you busy so that it's still fun for a while before you start noticing the downsides.			"

												Stellaris is perhaps the greatest 4x game of this decade. After several disapointing Sifi games like Galactic Civ 3 and Masters of Orion, this game here is the giant jewel of sifi games! It is an indepth story driven 4x game about leading a fledgling empire that just got their hands on FTL technology (3 different types to choose from)  into becoming a dominant galactic super power. How you get to this strength is up to you, be a ruthless warlord who slaughters and enslaves thousands to fuel their economy, Join up with other nations and form a massive federation and many more, how you play is up to you.

												I Declared War On a Galaxy-Spanning Federation of Empires --- And I Won All Four Cede Planet Goals.It really doesn't seem worth it, to be honest, but the fighting was awesome when I stopped trying to pin down invasion fleets and just resorted to terror-bombing their homeworlds to lure them out (after counter-invading lost worlds, of course).Maybe you're supposed to conquer the galaxy through mass vassalization and integration, rather than directly?In retrospect: Probably. Looking forward to squishing all the squishies and squashies before taking down that Federation. Maybe even finally take down the Fallen Empire I've been stuck next to all game. I still remember the day they made me burn ten colonies for their own amusement.Serious respect to the ten or so colony empire that actually pushed me off their homeworld, though, even if they had powerful friends helping.I bought Stellaris Full-Price and it's totally worth it, even if they weren't updating it. Totally worth it.Too bad my friends don't have it, Multiplayer would be neat.			"

												What I, a Filthy Casual, thinks:The last sci-fi strategy game I played was Galactic Civilizations III and this game is similar but with a lot more depth (and this game hasn't even been out as long right now so there are a host of free updates and expansion packs to look forward to). This review is not aimed at hardcore strategy players who are looking for their next tactical fix.+ Many species designs for your aesthestic pleasure+ Mix and match a variety government types + A choice of galaxy sizes & shapes (blob/spiral arm/ring)+ Pre-space age planets (not other empires) that can be probed, enslaved or enlightened+ Make a fleet! Name the fleet! Name the ships! Name the Admiral! SEND IT TO WAR!+ Rename all the stars you own to goofy names and stupid references 'cos why not+ Micromanage EVERYTHING unlike real-life where you have no control+ Make sectors when your empire gets too big and micromanaging becomes a chore+ Optional pop-up missions (plotlines!) with various rewards+ A burgeoning modding community to add extra flavour+ Involved developers offering updates and new content in the future!- Limited tutorial, no in-game help- Can modify weapons on ships but cannot alter appearance like in GalCiv III- Diplomacy (pacifist) options limited and not fun. Can't make friends easily like in Civilization- Seriously, why do all my neighbouring empires hate me?! THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.- For scaredy cats: cannot avoid hostiles early in-game (no option to turn them off)- For impatient people: cannot hammer out a game in a day like in CivilizationWord to the one sitting on the fence:If you've never played a 4X or grand strategy game before, or are a Filthy Casual like me, this game does kind of throw you into the deep end a little. The game isn't turn-based, it runs time like The Sims with pause, slow, faster options (recommended: pause when making decisions and reading stuff). Anyway, don't feel scared to potter around in a couple false starts games in order to get to grips with the game mechanics before you look up a few Beginner's Tutorials. From there on, when you encounter something you need more information, there is a really helpful community and forum archive available full of answers.If you're not afraid of time sinks, love exploring, love building and managing empires, and have the patience to play the long game then this game is definitely worth it (it's not even that expensive).

												If Stellaris were to be a turn-based game, it would most definitely become one of those one-more-turn addictions. But it's not. That's why it's a one-more-hour addiction... ""why is the sun rising? it was just going down moments ago""After several hours into patch 1.3 I know am 100% sure this game is going into the right direction. I also recommend the DLCs (especially when on sale) as they add quite alot feeled content even if the facts don't look like it.			"

												Immersive and entertaining, a game of Stellaris is whatever you want it to be. I’ve tried to play through with a number of combinations of traits, and more often than not, I’ve failed – at least the first time – because I haven’t been able to adjust my playing style well enough.It’s a good start to a game I’ll be playing for a long time – and here’s to hoping that the on-going DLCs only make Stellaris better.

												Oh boy, here we go...War score system:      Forcing you to play within the limitation of the war goal and also Capping the War score at 100 is stupid and illogical. We are essentially limiting a pan-galactic empire to the rules of some primitive feudal state. All this does is it artificially slows down the game by forcing wars to last centuries instead of a few years. Let us ignore the obvious thematic and logical issues of this design choice and just look at mechanics: This system works somewhat well when you are nothing but a couple of fledgling empires slugging it out in the local clusters, but once you have a large alliance or federation it becomes incredibly frustrating to play with. Here are some obvious ones: If you have more than 4 allies, it is almost impossible to make war against someone as most planets are worth ~20 warscore apiece.Diplomacy:    This simply isn't fleshed out enough, there are no meaningful interaction between empires beyond the most simplistic ground rules (Alliance, enemies, rivals etc.). There isn't even a gifting/tribute system! I can give my allies a million credits/minerals and they will still not like me one bit better than if I did not. This also makes relationships relatively permanent outside of some trite predetermined 'diplomatic actions' like insult or rivalry. I can conquer the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of someone and as long as I don't personally keep any of the loot, they won't even bat an eye a year later.Technology Tree:     There is no real way to influence which tech you get beyond memorizing the arcane multiplication table between researcher traits and the various gain rates. It makes zero thematic sense that the overlord of an empire cannot tell its researchers to put more effort into an area. I don't necessarily want a guaranteed chance, but at least give me a way to throw credits/influence to increase the probability of one of the techs showing up. I had the misfortune in my last game to be surrounded by 20+ arid planets but could not find the colonization tech to take them until well into the mid-late game. Incredibly frustrating, makes little logical sense and makes the game random in such a way that is unfun. It is entirely possible to have your race spawn in a corner of the galaxy without any naturally colonizable planets and then never get the colonization techs. This ends the game without you ever making a mistake..Technological Growth/Research:     The time it takes to research a tech is increased by the number of pop you have in your empire. Logically, this is the OPPOSITE of what should happen in real life as more people tend to produce more scientists with more chances of discovering things. From a design point of view, this decision to tie population with tech only serves to punish players who prefer to be expansionist or who are aggressive early on. You have a technological edge if you have a small focused empire, since technology has no real limit in this game, this eventually just becomes a tax on every player. Thus, the only mechanical result of this design is to slow down games to a crawl. AI, as usual, does not appear to have this problem. It is also possible that their natural 'cheats' to research rate overcomes this in large part. In the last game I played, the larger enemies actually out tech'd me at a faster rate than the smaller ones (I'm behind even the smallest empire, even though I have every single one of my 122 planets focused on research).As a direct consequence of you always being technologically inferior to most of your rivals, you simply cannot allow a game to last longer than a century or so. The '5% tech' that you get at the end of the tech tree means that AI empires will infinitely out-scale you and eventually will overcome even the largest of industrial capacity disparities.Strategic Combat:    There is no consequence in letting a fleet rampaging through your sectors. There is no concept of 'defending your territory'. Economic damage is almost irrelevant and even holding planets does not accomplish much at all. This is a huge problem when you are fighting large empires (30-40 planets or more) as fighting becomes tedious and inconsequential. This is especially true if you have hundreds of planets in the late game of large galaxies. The only objective that matters are the enemy's fleets and your only real war goal is to kill their big fleet stacks. If the AI raids a dozen of your planets but you nail his fleet, then you win. Period. Even if the warscore is -99%, you will still get your planets back as long as your fleet survives and his doesn't.There isn't' really a way to prevent a fleet from running through your systems either: Defensive stations tend to be pathetically weak compared to ships, they are also extremely expensive and difficult to stack. This leads to enemy AI sending dozens of tiny raiding parties into your territory, murdering everything they can get their hands on. Especially once they get jumpdrive tech. The only way to ensure victory against AI is to cluster your shipyards in one or two systems, put ALL of your defenses in those stations and always have a fleet nearby to protect it. The rest of your empire literally does not matter. As long as you have production capabilities, you will win every war. In fact, having as little assets outside of those few production sectors is key in not losing the war as you will still lose warscore by losing small and inconsequential space battles.If there is a single optimal way to win the strategic game, then your design is fundamentally flawed. This is compounded by the fact that AI excels at performing annoying but not game-winning actions.End game Crisis:   This is only a crisis for you, Ai doesn't apparently care about any of the big galaxy ending events. You can't even tell your ally fleet to follow into combat against any of them, nor will they react diplomatically in anyway. I had my ally declaring multiple wars(or had rivals declaring wars on me even as they are being eaten alive by the threat) while I'm trying to deal with these events and nearly cost the game for me.Sectors(Flaw/bug): AI governors are dumb as bricks. At the same time, Sector automation is indispensable in this game. I've seen AI filling up planets with +23 food when the pop is already full (or even when the pop doesn't consume food, like synths and robots). Telling them to focus on a specific thing or telling them to respect tiles only seem to work some of the time. Very little work seems to have gone into making the sectors actually work properly.Strategically, the segregation between sector space assets and core world assets is also very annoying. You can't really tell sectors to produce ships because it becomes a nightmare to micro them without them showing up in the sidebar. This actually changes how one plays the game because warfleets are difficult/impossible to produce in non-core worlds and your production ends up being limited to how many core planets you possess. This becomes enormously problematic once your empire gets large - in large or gigantic maps, you can't produce ships fast enough to fight a 100+ planet empire because the AI apparently does NOT have this problem with user interface and micromanagement.This is just some of the things I noticed in my prelim play throughs. There are other things that I do not agree with but did not include because they are preference related. TL;DRStellaris is a really amazing 4x game and I think it has built the right foundations for one of the most amazing strategy games of all time. However, there are many questionable design choices in the game that I feel limits strategic variety or pidgeonholes the player in some illogical way. I for one am glad that paradox is embracing the modding community as it will take a tremendous amount of support from them to make this game truly meet its potential.			"

												If you've ever wanted to run a space empire and play a 4X game that is more about telling the story of your people rather than managing spreadsheets to min max your empire, Stellaris is for you! Some may say this is a light verison of a 4X games, but what it lacks in economic/millitary depth, it makes up for in explorations and great story moments that stick with you. If you've always wanted to try out grand strategy games, but felt overwhelmed by games like Civilization or Master of Orion this is the game for you!			"

												Best 4x space game on the market.I have been playing 4x space games since the original MOO, and this carries the torch forwardThe good:Replayability is nearly endless, each government type creates unique playstyles.The developers continually add great new content both free and paid for.The community mods are top notch making a vast game endless.The pacing is fluid and not turn based, though resources are allotted at the end of each month, making for a much more organic feel to the pacing, which can be set.Early game is exciting as mysteries and stories / missions unlock, there is a sense of exploration and mystery.  Late Game has some really well implemented crisis / contentThe BadMid game is plodding and boring, though new DLC may change that with the upcoming Banks release.AI seems to ... cheat a little.Some bugs around content, which may kill a story arc, though the game itself will keep on going.

												Wow, this game is what Civilization: Beyond Earth should have been! It combines the best parts of Civ 5 strategy and merges them seamlessly with a serious amount of conquest. I am 4 hours in and have already met 2 dangerous enemies, investigated and colonized several solar systems, and started to build up my military force. I expect the net four hours to be dominated by war and conquest as I butt heads with my aggressive neighbors. There is a lot of detail in this game and it has a high learning curve, but that makes it all the more fun. The in-game help and narration is essential to getting off to a good start.Totally recommend this game!			"

												After spending over 175 hours playing Stellaris, I feel I have a good idea about the game to write this review. Mind you all that even after all this time, I am still learning/experiencing new things about this game, so keep that in mind. When you first load in you're presented with a lot of premade empires, which is great for new people to get a feel for the game and it's mechanics. Each empire has it's own ethics and government, which allows/denies them certain abilities like purging/enslaving aliens, as well as how your empire reacts to war.  You are able to make your own empire and design it to fit the play-style you want, which I have done multiple times. Each of the ethic and government choices you pick are personal preference, there isn't one that is the best, though other's will disagree with me, but it ultimately comes down to what you want. After you start playing you'll have the choice to do the tutorial, which has two modes (one is full and the second is partial) or skip it all together. I would strongly recommend you use the full tutorial for your first few times playing so you can get a better grasp on the vastness of this game. Before you start playing you will see a screen that allows you to create the 'perfect' game, though sometimes it might not be, and I'll explain in a bit what I mean. From the screen you can choose how big you want the galaxy to be, ranging from a small map (150 stars) to a huge map (1000 stars). there you are able to change how you want the galaxy to look, how many alien empires you want and how many of them are more advanced than you, as well as the aggressiveness of the AI and the difficulty. One option I always have issues with is the placement, where you can either be clustered together (meaning the AI will be close by) or randomly placed. No matter which option I choose I am always next to the AI, even if I choose a huge map with 1 AI, but I digress. Now that you have messed around with these settings and you launch into the galaxy for the first time, it can be a bit daunting, even on small maps I still find myself a small spec in the cosmos. One thing that I do love the most is that each map is randomly generated, meaning everything is different each time you start over. As you explore the nearby systems you learn more about the galaxy, or at least what was before. The majority of the time I get the precursor event chains where I have to search for artifacts left behind and figure out what happened to them. Other times you might find yourself with a mass extension event where you have to search the stars for clues on how to save your own empire, all of these are random and rather interesting, but after a few times playing you get a feeling of repetitiveness, for right now there's only four events at the start. ------------politics!!!-------------------------------- As you explore the stars you will encounter alien races and depending on how you manage to interact with them (based on your first contact protocols) they might favor or loath you. this can be changed but I feel that it does little because the AI goes off of your ethics when making decisions about how to treat your empire. Although they might distrust you at first, you're more than able to befriend them in time, or turn against those who are quick to accept alien life as allies, the choice is (mostly) up to you. -----------researching!!---------------------------As you progress in your research, you unlock new tech which allows you to progress and expand your boarders. from colony ships to massive energy weapons, the choices are many, but eventually you will learn everything and then will be left with repeatable research options. Though they will help late game, it does get a bit tiresome researching the same thing over and over again.---------------------Combat!-----------------Combat is broken up into two parts, for the most part. Space battles and ground battles. the AI does a good job for the most part with determining who would win in a battle. As you build up your fleet, it grows in fleet power, the more ships you have, the more guns/missiles/lasers you have. When you do go to war, you really want to have more fleet power than your enemy, or else the losses you will receive will be great and could possibly cost you the war. When you go to war (Either by declaring war on someone else or having them declare war on you) there are a lot at stake. Some of the war-goals range from just being humiliated among the galaxy to losing your planets. in every war (either attacking or defending) you have the option of setting the war-goals, so make sure that even if you manage to be on the defensive end of a war, you might be able to take some of their planets. When war is declared you can win by either destroying their entire fleet, or bombarding their planets. there's three options to bombard their planets, light, limited, or full. For the most part you start out with the first two but you might be able to change the ethic to allow full bombardment. After you take down the planetary defenses you can send in ground troops to invade, and if they win the battle the planet is under your control for the duration of the war. One thing I've learned about the AI is even if they start the war with you, they will divert their forces and try to retake the planets they've lost. During the war there is a progression icon with a percentage icon, and the more you win, the more it grows. However if you start losing it will start going into the negative which means the enemy is winning. Once it gets to around 50-60% it will turn either green or red (again, depending on if you're winning or not) which allows you  or the enemy to negotiate terms for the end of the war. Once it gets closer to 100% (if you're winning) the AI will concede and the war will be over. How the war goes is up to you. And there are other factors that go into play but this should give you a good idea of how things are done.------------END GAME EVENTS!!!-----------------One of the best things about this game, is the end game events. They are randomly generated events that could easily end the game not only for you, but for the AI in general. Some of the events are preventable, based on your research and ethics but others will happen in time. If you're lucky the events will be a challenge, if not then they will be damn near impossible. I'm not going to spoil them here, just make sure you have the option turned on to have a great end game challenge. -----END OF REVIEW/FINAL THOUGHTS-----This game is good, and the devs are fantastic with communicating with the players from what I've seen. I would strongly recommend this game to people.			"

												A lot of people give a pretty one-on-one description of what kind of stuff happened in their games. Because interstellar war is no joke, I decided to use a metaphor to describe one of my playthroughs in Stellaris.  Imagine having a very rude and obnoxious next-door neighbor who terrorizes everyone in the neighborhood. This neighbor has several kids whom he keeps under strict supervision. His kids, and everyone else in the neighborhood dislike the guy. One day, one of his kids runs away and asks if they can stay at your place, because you’re a cool guy. Being the nice person you are you agree and let them in. Neighbor does not like this. Later, another one of his kids runs away and asks if you’re willing to look out for them a bit and in exchange they’ll help you if someone picks a fight with you. They’re weak as hell, but you’re still trying to be chill and say yes. The neighbor doesn’t really care, and decides to let it rest. But sometime after his kids running away, he decides he doesn’t like you, and demands you go work for him. The guy is seriously buff and is much stronger than you are, so you quickly decide to surrender before he can mess you up. This results in you losing most of your freedom and you need to pay a lot of money before you’re allowed to do anything outside of your house. Furthermore, the neighbors with whom you had a pretty high standard pretend you don’t exist anymore. This is pretty awful. So you decide to do something about it. You go train at home. A lot. You become stronger and buffer than that pile of salt so you can stick up to him. Fast forward a few years. You’re not only one of the most well-trained people in the neighborhood, but the jerk of a neighbor has lost a lot of his muscle because he got in several fights with that cranky, crazy neighbor no one wants to mess with. You laugh maniacally inside, and relish the freedom you’ll soon have again. However, bad neighbor made a couple of buff friends who promise they’ll come help if he gets in a fight. Darn. Still, you’re pretty strong so you decide to risk it. You go up to the neighbor and tell him to get lost. He gets angry and attacks you. Luckily for you, you’re so strong you manage to knock him out in basically one blow. Then you go on to wreck his house room by room, until his friends arrive. His friends, however, are woefully unprepared for the 2 meter tall fighter which stands before them. They go at you one by one, and you knock them out too. Eventually, the neighbor gives up and lets you free.  He also rudely tells you to get lost. You’re happy, but you’re also pretty mad at the neighbor for being such a jerk. Being one of the strongest people in the hood, you decide to put insult to injury and occupy a few of the neighbors rooms. He does not like this, and calls for his friends. He and his friends are still weakened by the fight they had with you, and, like the brainless sods they are, also picked another fight with that crazy neighbor. After a couple of fights the jerk has to give up several of his rooms, which you then use for your stuff. It’s still not enough. Finally, you decide to put up a middle finger to the guy who terrorized the neighborhood for years: You’ll force him to give up his house and then be an unpaid slave to you. The only problem is, is that the loser became friends with the strongest person around. This is fairly annoying. They’re still dumb, and are still picking fights with that crazy guy which decimates everyone in a fight. Thus, they’re pretty weakened. So you go on to beat his butt and systematically occupy all of his rooms. He doesn’t want to give up, so you also beat up his friends repeatedly and occupy some of their houses as well. After a couple of years the guy finally gives up, and gives the keys to his house to you, and promises to provide unpaid labor. He hates you, but eventually he finds out you’re a pretty cool guy and starts to like working for you. At last, justice is served, and you’re free to dominate the galaxy with your stellar empire- I mean enjoy life in the neighborhood.			"

												I like CK2 a lot - This is not CK2 in space.I like 4X games - this hits the spot.I love turn based strategy games - This is real time strategy which I don't like, however it feel's like they've just streamlined turn based so you dont have to keep pressing enter. They've done it well (To be honest they just used the same system that works on CK2, but its not CK2 in space - I promise).The inevitable Moo2 comparison : I have played & mostly enjoyed many turn based 4X space games. Most just made me nostalgic for Moo2. Some intoduced good stuff. Some re-hashed stuff already done. Moo3 just had all the enjoyment of doing a tax return with a migraine. This game doesn't play like any of them. It's not a Moo2 clone in any way other than being 4X & set in space. I love Moo2, but after far too long I have now moved on. This game has filled the space I had in my heart for Moo2. It has succeeded it & improved on it.Now about the game :It is very complex but enjoyable from the start - expect to restart quite a bit at first though simply becaus as you learn whats what you learn what you've done & why it's wrong. Or just play it out for as long as you can.There is a lot of customization options to begin with - species - culture - politics - preferences - (probably more I dont remember) each choice you make will potentially open further choices, possible end game victory options or even end game disasters! Additionally there are plenty of options for the galaxy you play in.With the real time gameplay you can speed it up, slow it down or just pause it after every day if you insist it has to be played turn by turn (I did this for a while - change is scary). Eventually you get a feel for how the game is progressing & it just becomes natural.The tech progress is nothing too radical but has been done well & seems balanced. There are three main tech progression paths that have seperate research points allocated to them, and each is slightly randomised so each game will play different.The ship design is interesting & allows a lot of variation while keeping it as simple/streamlined as possible. You start off only building small ships, then cus of tech you get bigger ones, also cus of tech you need to keep them upto date with better weapons etc. Nothing new there, but because of the various restrictions fleets work better with diversity (as in more than one design filled with the best gun you got), and even the original small ship remains useful by being repurposed once certain tech is available - obsolete gunship to torpedo boat for example - You could design a fleet of ships that successfully destroys your one neighbours fleet with ease only to find out it may have a few too many vulnerabilities when faced with your other neighbour. And that's assuming a similar level of tech.The diplomacy works well & covers a lot of options. In addition to this the information on display shows why you are doing good/bad with a particular race. From your original customization options its possible you have just selected the exact oposite choices so you guys will not get along & war is inevitable, or you've just found your long lost twin and friendship is instant, also everything inbetween. Interestingly how you deal with each race, and all the other races, and even your own people is over time taken into account by all the other races.Exploration is interesting & is covered below.***The above is just the standard info that compares to other space based 4X games - now for what makes Stellaris different***You aren't the ruler of a race who started on one planet and reach into the galaxy to claim his/her destiny through conquest/ascension/genocide/glory/oblivion/galactic-appocalypse. Your just not.In this game you design the original planetary leader, but only that one and only because one is needed to begin with.Have you ever read a book or seen a TV show where you thought : I'd do something different, I wonder how that would have turned out. Well this is your chance. This is a fully interactive story that is different every time you go through it. That's what makes this special. Every time you explore somewhere it's exciting - a hundred hours I've played so far & I still love exploring. I'm still encountering new stuff. Even stuff I've encountered in previous games is exciting because I can take those other options.This is the story of the race you chose - the story of their leader's, hero's, war's, friendship's, glory & folly. The story of a race that reaches from one world into the stars & the galaxy is a very dangerous but interesting place.Also if yor not bored yet:Like CK2 Stellaris is made by Paradox - this means it is being updated constantly & new expansion DLC is guaranteed. So the game is getting bigger & better & optionally more expensive. I'm not sure how I feel about that cus most of my CK2 DLC was purchased while drunk, but it was on offer & I really wanted it.Also since I decided I needed the 1st DLC for this I can now play as an imortal(but not un-killable) galactic hive mind. So, playing as a single entity spread accross worlds & star systems I guess I could say it was my story, but I prefer other races & single these abominations out for extermination!!Oh yeh - there's multiplayer - doesn't interest me.

												Now I know most people won't read this. Due to the fact that there are plenty of other reviews on the page that will go into much more detail. But for those of you who do find yourself reading my review, know that this is an amazing game. Though not for everyone. The main reason I recommended this at all is because I love paradox games and know with time this game will only become better. People say when you hit your lowest point the only way to go is up. Well that's stellaris. It's low point is already miles ahead of other games, and still has so much room to grow. If you like previous games by paradox and don't mind the DLC, get it. If you're on the fence or weren't a big fan of the others, wait for a sale. But at some point this game should be in your library.			"

												There are many issues with this game, but holy crap it's been a long time since I've played a game for 12 hours straight on my first session.  Issues aside, this is a great game that will get better with a little love from the devs.Some of the issues I've noticed are:-Mid game border cluster♥♥♥♥s where you can't really interact with people you don't have a border with.  (Without getting military access to space that lies inbetween you, the devs have stated they are working on this.)-Mediocre Ai that are great in some areas and terrible in others. (Ai are also too passive in some situations and highly predictable from a diplomatic POV.)-Lack of any form of major diplomatic UI such as color coding alliances, Ai's opinion of other factions, ect.-Too few victory conditions?  (This is more my personal opinion, just look at how many ways you can win in Civ)-Lack of internal/external trading.There are certainly a few more, but I believe these are the major points.All in all, I've put nearly 60 hours into a game that was released just under 2 weeks ago.  The UI is pretty good in most areas, and it was surprisingly easy to pick up when compared to Paradox's other games.  I've thoroughly enjoyed this game so far and I can't wait to see what future updates and expansions are on their way.			"

												Good game crippled by a bad UI.  A lot of things 4X players would expect to see such as auto-explore options for scout ships weren't even in at launch.  The planet/sector management interface is sorely lacking in sorting options.  There is no interface to view potentially colonizable planets, and the only way to do so is by hovering over the galaxy map looing for green planet icons that disappear if you zoom too far out.That said, the events and race designs are really well done, though the AI seems to balk at the eXpand portion of the 4x genre.  Almost 200 years into a playthrough there were still a LOT of habitable planets on the edge of the galaxy that were sitting uncolonized.  The endgame threats are cool though, and I'm looking forward to what the game will look like in 3-6 months with some TLC centered on the mid game lull and UI shortcomings.			"

												This game has been one of the funnest 4x stategies I have ever experienced. There are a few mechanics and things that need to fix, but I still love it. This game has endless replay quality and I love exploring the galaxies! As Paradox has stated, they will continue to patch the game and add new content in the future IF enough people play and buy the game. If you don't like the game now, maybe you will like it later.

												I've been enjoying Stellaris a lot so far, but I have a few issues with it:+Epic Scale, the largest galaxies can have 1000 Star Systems, each with multiple planets+Beautiful Graphics, the battles look great, weapon effects and sounds are good for the most part+Customization of Species traits, Government, Appearance, Names etc.+Ship design, a very user friendly ship design+Multiple interesting events and locations to explore+Different FTL systems that really change how you play and explore the Galaxy+Long term epic strategy, you can take a species that you discover on a planet from Iron Age tech up to eventually be assimilated into your Empire as an equal member-species (It takes a long time, but I've done it!)-Limit of 5 planets (Initially, can be increased through tech) that you directly manage. You have to create 'sectors' to control more. The AI that manages you sectors really sucks, I had to take a system out of a sector and manage it myself for a while then put it back it as the AI wasn't doing anything I asked it to do. I supplied the sector with plenty of resources to build up those planets within its control.-No tech tree, you get a draw of 3 techs to research (initially, you receive more through exploring and tech upgrades) It makes it hard to plan out what tech you want to research initially, but with further play this might be less of an issue-limited trade with other species, I had a surplus of energy and shortage of minerals, but I couldn't trade away my surplus fast enough to supplement my mineral requirements. The AI usually wants to have a better deal than you are getting otherwise it will reject it. Also, sometimes they won't even trade with you despite you giving them a huge advantage, they still feel insulted that you offered them that deal??-AI for enemies sucks because they all hate you for going for the win conditions. Its really annoying actually.			"

												Giving this a tentitive yes. I only played through once so probably missed a lot of things my first go around.The good:Basically this is ""epic"" mode for any other 4x strategy game. It takes a long time to do things and there's usually a lot going on to distract you from your plans. Great depth with good story elements Easy to learn and get started, but lots of depth later on Challenging but not always in a good way - lots of domestic management opportunities but few options to actually control and influence.The BadIt takes away a lot of planning capabilities so you just kind of float around hoping you roll someting good.  No research structure. Random choices appear, but there's not ability to strategically focus on any one area.  Not many levers for when you get in trouble. All micromanagement is forced out of your hands (you can only actively manage 5 planets at a time which tend to become your main sources of income.  Lots of choices but no clear meaning or impact to what you decide. Eventually you just stop caring.  Boring mid-game. You've already outsourced all your planets to your districts to manage, so there's not a lot to do but research and maybe wage war (if you can afford it).Overall 7/10 but could definitely be awesome with a few patched gameplay tweaks			"

												IF you are as old as me, you can appreciate when I say, this game brings me back to the pure joy, and occasionally the frustration, I had when I played the ORIGINAL Sid Meier's Civilization back in 1991 -- that's 25 years ago!I remember playing Civ back then, not realizing how much time had passed, and how how quickly it passed, all because this GAME swept you up in its wonderful 4x mechanics -- and that's what I'm reliving now with Stellaris.  Sure, it's got a few flaws, but between patches and mods, you can fix or tweek just about anything you might find to complain about.So this isn't so much of a technical review, as it's much more of a thank you to Paradox for bringing that feeling back -- bravo, folks, bravo!

I should mention that I only play these kinds of games in the most difficult settings or conditions. Easy mode is braindead. no challenge at all. Medium is Meh.

												Edit-written on 5/16/2016 some things might be changed for people in the, say it with me, FUTURENote- I've played much less than what is shown. I basicaly never turn my pc off and since I've played this a lot I've left run on in the background for a very long time without playing, like when I'm sleeping sometimes. Anyways-The ai is fairly good. In war, the convintionial fleet warfare it is quite good. However it is quite poor at coordinating with its allies in the sense of not defending the not most powerful ally's territory, but its very good with its allies in the sense of presenting a unified front. It doesn't seem to understand how to fight a war of attrition, and it is horrible at ground combat, attacking and defending. It also struggles with certain alternitive styles of warfare that a player can use like guarlia style, which I've used to great sucess winning the three wars I tried it in where I was reasoniable outmatched and couldn't win in a direct fight. Fleet battles themselves are a bit bugged like if one side fully retreats then no one wins or losses, as far as warscore is concerned. In ai diplomacy it's well done; it's much like EU4. The ai is perphaps not agrressive enough, but I blame that mostly on most alien civs being peaceful kinds of governments. The ai seems to be very good at exsploring. Its seems to be resoniable at managing resource tiles. The  ia isn't agressive enough at colonaision. It is very good at ship design, but almost all the aliens I fought didn't have as many ships as they should of have, but they were mostly federation builders personialies or something similiar. Big bug right now is slavery is broken in the sense that slaves will never revolt. I also found an odd bug in that if you are invading a planet, then in the middle of the battle before can retreat, you end the war and they keep the planet you were attacking your troops will disapear. but the gamewill still think they are the planet so you can always see the planet even though nothing of yours is there. Despite its problems I still say you should play it; most bugs are anoying, but none are game breaking*. * well some are, but they either fix themselves over game time or a reload fixes them. To sumarize at this point its a good grand statagy game, up there with CK2 and EU4, but it is bad 4x game. Its more a 4x lite, grand statagy is the main. I say ignore the victory goals, make your own, its much better that way. Roleplaying in it is very fun like in CK2, however you for the most part don't have to do stupid things for roleplay. Its like EU4, but not as cut throat. Its half of each in space with its own uquine elements with the potentionial to become the best grand statagy. Right I say its the best grand stategy in space, after all there arn't very many, most are mainly 4x.			"

												The game overall is extremely good, judging by the 113.5 hours I have logged in the first WEEK of the game being released. That being said, you will enjoy this game until you have to declare war on someone. The warscore system is genuinely the worst war system I've ever seen in a 4x game, and I play A LOT of 4x games. The game forces you to create ""war goals"" which at first glance make sense, until you realize that you can only capture a few PLANETS (not systems) at a time, or form a protectorate over the enemy. You CANNOT just sweep in on a declaration of war and eliminate/capture an entire empire in one swoop. You have to ""liberate"" or capture three or so at a time, and then accept peace. Wait like 10-20 years, and THEN declare war again, but usually that just turns everyone against you. So for a game that says it gives you the freedom to create whatever kind of empire you want, it's true on that part. But what it fails to deliver on, is allowing you to actually carry that out. If you want to create an empire that is hell-bent on capturing and destroying everyone, you can create that, but once you have to actually begin taking over systems and empires, be ready to break out some painkillers for the massive headache that is the warscore system.Additionally,  most everything else people say is true. The UI can screw you over at times, and if it does it REALLY screws you over, but in my experience that has been very few and far between, if at all. The Federation system to me doesn't totally make sense, since I don't really see the benefit in forming one. (Not in a philosophical sense, but a gameplay sense. I don't see any in-game benefit with forming a federation anyway. Just more reason to pull out the painkillers.To sum this game up, you WILL thoroughly enjoy this. Paradox has yet again created a stellar 4x game that again sets the standard for other companies to live up to. This is the way 4x games should be made. Like I said, I play a lot of 4x, including the complicated micro-managing ultimate 4x simulator Distant Worlds: Universe. This game is just a lot more fun to play. DW: U might be more of the ""classic 4x"" game, but Stellaris is a game you can jump into every single time and enjoy your playtime. That's a game I'd recommend.			"

												tl;dr - If you like RTS-ish games and like playing online, buy this game and thank me later.There is something in this game that makes you wanna play ""just another turn"". The problem is - this game is not turn-based.My brother and I bought it, started a multiplayer game imidiatelly after and saved only after straight 8 hours of playing. This game is extremely fun while just starting alone, but once you meet other players and truly start playing multi - you get a nice +150% fun and -200% boredom passive bonus. Each of us had different problems and issues to deal with, different traits and different hyperdrives to use. Once we found each other, we formed an alliance and those differences became our assets. I'm sure we didn't even experience 50% of what this game has to offer, but I can't wait to see the rest of it.			"

												My wife and I are obsessed with this game.  It is the best space strategy game I've played.  Highly recommend playing this game.  It has a great single player replayability, but it truely shines in multiplayer, especially if you can get a group of friends to continue playing in the same galaxy.The UI is fairly easy to learn and use and does not require memorizing a bunch of hotkeys (though there are a few you can use if that's your thing).  I love the ability to explore, colonize, build, trade, negotiate, and fight with the other players and the AI.  You can tailor the settings to make it challenging throughout the game from the first century to the last and beyond.Great game.  Huge thanks to the developers.

												Stellaris is one of the rare games where you truly cannot predict exactly how a given playthrough will go. You may choose the same 'nation', the same traits, species, galaxy shape and size - and yet one game will have you expand at an enormous pace, the next will have you face to face with an overwhelmingly powerful xenophobic curb-stomping force of a neighbour.As with Crusader Kings 2, Paradox has already shown an interest and willingness to adapt and develop Stellaris well beyond its release state. This one is well-worth grabbing, and is a must-buy if you enjoyed CK2.			"

												An absolutely amazing space 4X game that brings some new twists and life to the genre. Before I go on, know that there are some issues with the game as it is now. Late game ends up a bit lacking, and the interface needs some work. Diplomatic communication and AI needs a small upgrade too. BUT, don't think the game is unplayable if these things worry you. If you pick up this game, my advice to you, is grab your favorite sci-fi, and roleplay it. This game is unprecedented on the feeling it gives you as the leader of your empire. It IS your empire, and it IS your guys that are being badass. It's kinda hard to put it in words, but you are going to end up immersed and that familiar ""One more turn"" feeling that sucks you down the rabbit hole, will hit you HARD. As it is now, this game is one of my all time favorites, right up there with the classics, and it's only going to get better. Paradox has always had extensive support with updates and fantastic DLC after launch. And you can mod this game with the same fervor you mod Skyrim, just waiting on those total conversion mods, yum. So yes. Recommended with high marks.  "

""What's where"" is a real issue as well as notification spam. Yet somehow it keeps running if not sputtering as opposed to crashing.- Easy to snowball without challange by accumulating non-rebelabe vassals- Faction system is not as challenging			"

Problem is, I found stellaris while waiting for MOOCTS to become less buggy, and more like MOO2..... and it turns out stellaris everything I've looking for in a 4X space game and more. A Few Things:The game gives you the feel of actually exploring out from your solar system. Surveying feels meaningful and enjoyable with storyline elements and technlogies introduced from discoveries. The choices you make in creating a race have a definite effect on how your empire will grow and what problems you will encounter in your growth.Space battles are enjoyable and actually performed in the same solar system view, in real time, as your empire management. No clunky transition or other players having to wait. Balance of the ship weapons and attributes could be adjusted a bit but I have no real suggestions on how to addequately do so.Technology research feels meaningful, having standard, rare, reverse engineered, and dangerous technologies to choose from, each with there intrinsic benefits and risks is new to me. Technologies seem to impact game mechanics enough to really try and research and aquire/level-up scientists.Having leaders, governors, admirals, and generals is a nice throwback to MOO2. Their benefits, stats, and effects on gameplay make them important and valuable... and dissappointing when they die of old age.AI is enjoyable but could use some work. There are a few quirks that I'm sure are not attributed to be a race actually being programmed to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Most of these quirks happen to be odd behavior and responses when trading/treaties/etc., a few others are in the actual war goals management and/or the behavior of attacking fleets during wartime. These minor AI issues do not reduce the enjoyment of the game enough not to buy it though. Buy it. Enjoy it. Enough said.			"

												Stellaris is one of the rare games where you truly cannot predict exactly how a given playthrough will go. You may choose the same 'nation', the same traits, species, galaxy shape and size - and yet one game will have you expand at an enormous pace, the next will have you face to face with an overwhelmingly powerful xenophobic curb-stomping force of a neighbour.As with Crusader Kings 2, Paradox has already shown an interest and willingness to adapt and develop Stellaris well beyond its release state. This one is well-worth grabbing, and is a must-buy if you enjoyed CK2.			"

												Best game of it's class. Still having a lot of fun playing with friends.This is not just another strategy game, this is the perfect balance between complexity ;it's actually not complex, if you compare it to civ, i find it easier and above all, more relaxed to play; and a strategygame . The influence, postition, neighbours and your own actions have is truly awesome. You can plan all you want, but your ingame situation will govern your empire. The only game in a long long time that i will recommend to anyone that has a PC. 9001/9000			"

												After about 6 hours of playtime (Which means playing the ""tutoral"" to transition early-mid game).This is a pretty slow paced game, and takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning. If you are accustomed to Paradox's titles, that shouldn't be a problem; but if you compare this game directly to similar titles (Endless space, Sins of a solar empire) you will definitely notice that combat is not as highly prioritized here. Definitely is a beautiful game, but not really action packed.About 3 hours into the game, something hard to identify happened that really sparked my interest. Hard to describe, but something pulls me into the game to make sure my invented space race will triumph and succeed.I figure I'll get as much value out of this as Crusader Kings or Europa Universalis, which are some of my most played games on Steam. A good enough feat,I guess.***ADDITION***So, after finishing the first ""tutorial campaign"" in about 24 hours, I am really starting to fall in love with this game as well. There is definitely enough content here to carry the game through 100 hous of gameplay. It will only get better with the coming DLCs.One superb aspect of the game is the configuration of your starships. It's really fun to spend time in the Ship Designer and try to figure out the perfect combination of Hulls, shields, weapons; all in regard to your Empire bonuses.The combat needs some more work though - as it is now you have too little control of formations and stuff like that. Not unusal for a Paradox game, but in this game you really want to make sure your ship designs fight as intended.All in all, an even stronger recommendation thatn before!			"

												Paradox have outdone themselves.>The customisation for your race, ships, planets etc and the ability to rename practically everything makes it really feel like something to care about or create some hilarious parrot based socialism.>The AI is solid, they will build different kinds of ships, diplomacy is more cautious upon first contact as you'd expect discovering a new space faring species and ethos differences really matter.>The different FTL methods of travel allow for fresh ideas and tactics for expanding and warring in each game.>Different ethos present vastly different challenges in each game- pacifists have to deal with conquered enemy pops because theyre not going to purge them, they have to be friendly and slowly incorporate them into their empire, whilst fanatic militarists might just kill them all (as my friend space hitler did in our multi game)There's 1 or 2 minor bugs as can be expected on release, nothing game alterring though that can't be fixed, and this is paradox- I've come to find this company the most reliable games company especially in this format of grand stategy- Bugs will be fixed, the game play will be alterred slightly and mixed up to freshen up the game every now and then.All in all this game gets 11 singularities out of 10, quite the paradox.

												My friend really rattled me to get this game, Hard. REALLY hard, it was a good thing that he convinced me to get it.If you like a game that involves building an empire and expanding in a universe, chances are this game is for you. It's a bit like Sid Meier's civilization but done right in a space sort of sense. The enjoyment of the game really comes when playing with friends, weither you play to beat them or play with them against AI. Which by the way the single player is pretty enjoying too if you just wanna play a game to pass time.There is a few downpoints to this game though, Even though you can play with 32 players chances on getting in a game with that many players is close to impossible, (it's kinda unnecessary to be honest) The highest amount of people I've seen when going online is at least 4 people. The game also Lacks solarsystem styles. I want more solar systems that can make a game interesting in a strategic sort of way.			"

												So my story goes like ""I've heard a few things about this game, so I guess I'm gonna find out what's what and treat myself to a couple of hours of relaxing gaming since I've got to get up for work next morning aaaaand it's dawn.""In the early 2000s there was this game called Haegemonia. It was my first (and last, until now) 4x space strategy and, boy oh boy, it was absolutely glorious for that time. So ever since I've been looking for a worthy successor to that game. In Stellaris I've found just the thing I was searching for.Sure it's got a few flaws, mainly in the UI department, but the level of immersion it gives the player is simply unparallel. Paradox made space great again.			"

												Wow this game is really fun!!!It fels like a true strategy game while playing it, there are some times that you just sit there and let time pass, and there are times that you have to command your fleet and attack enemy systems while protecting yours. You do have to kinda make the story yourself, for example, I had a 2K strenght fleet against a 6K strength fleet, basic math tells you I was going to lose that battle, but because I was the spartan version of the space penguins, I did not retreat and did not surrender. This game is for people looking to kick back, have some fun, AND BE FORCED TO ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT A VIDEO GAME NOT JUST POINT AND CLICK.For those who just could not get a grasp on crusader kings 2, I was in that boat, but I read a few articles and watched a video or two on youtube and decided that I could understand this game, and with the AI assistant they put in, it makes it very easy to understand.

												9,5/10, writing a review since I nominated Stellaris as ""Just 5 more minutes"" awardExcellent space grand strategy game. It falls somewhere between Endless space and Distant Worlds in terms of realism and gameplay. Exploration and colonization in the early game is the best part of Stellaris and also endgame crises bring flavour to the end. Midgame suffers a bit from repetition. Sectors are a nice way to defeat the most horrible enemy of space 4x games: micromanagement.			"

												For me who has a real hard time getting started on these kind of games, I have found this ""managably challenging"".  I could without 2 days of reading and watching videos play and understand enough to get going. Only to find that the whole evening has gone. By now you read the reviews, so I will just say no it;s not perfect, but nothing game breaking. I own most of Pardoxe's games, but this one got me.  As of writing this I have 21 hours but I see a lot more in the near future.			"

												TLDR version: It's good in same way as Skyrim... As in fun, but you definitly feel the game is bare-bones and lacking content wise some areas. Buggy as a TES game as well. Mods are what is going to keep this afloat above many other 4x games after the massive hypetrain has left station.Messy Rant section:Game offers you 6 city and 6 ship looks for each race category. Good chance all mammals fly the same design and all fungals fly their type. Cities seen in tiny window is a nice thouch, kinda a vague reminder from old Heroes turn based strategy games, would love to see more alternatives... As in ship design, you can easy design ship weapons etc. equipment. Ship combat is equally simplistic, as in order attack commando and that's it, with possible emergency ftl retreat (seriously damages ships). I like. However the styling of said ships gets blown so far out of the water and into unknown Blorg space in comparison to Galactic Civilizations III ship design. Only limit there is your imagination. Guess Paradox want to grind out our pockets for more options here in future. Offtopic- Gief endgame crisis there the GC 3 Crusade comes to cleanse the galaxy if there is no human empires alive or free? And what happen to slave uprising?Traits for your races are seriously limited in options. A lesser degree with flags and symbols. In first vanilla game I had difficulties seeing what faction owned what. I was orange and so was my vassal and 2 of my neighbours. Thankfully partly fixed by mods now.While talking about my vanilla game with no mods, I got no achievements. However I don't care about that, but thought I should mention it anyway.Mod menu is permanently bugged out, as in dropdown list over categories are stuck over the mod listing. Really annoying. (Validated the game files twice, not really into reinstalling yet)AI, is really♥♥♥♥♥♥atm. like in most 4x games. Hope you like getting spammed by sharing Star Charts, typically if you have explored more than them (might be random how good that trade is though). Classic strategy of 4x games, Diplomacy = spammed by worthless deals by ai. (Civ 5 and embassy requests trauma)You will have puny vassals hating your guts and being disloyal when they are no position to break free (cud not bribe them with energy or minerals either for more love). Pretty certain only reason they survived at all was because of me shielding them from other empires.Your AI controlled sectors will be poorly optimized, feeling the need for mods to ignore the sector use completely. Examples I saw over 20 systems. Research sector building energy over research yields, food over energy yields and research right next to capital building over food yields? Sectors also have no way of earning or getting influence to build or upgrade buildings? Also miss a balanced optimization plan on sector overview, as it builds what is best and try to avoid overflow of food when a planet is full on population. For you see, paradox don't believe in trade between planets. :pTech and traits for getting back resources from sectors should also be a thing. Lots of tech options, which is good for the random tech tree is a blessing against cookie cutter spec. Problem is that most extra weapon techs from early aliens don't really stand out compared to default weapon techs, as in ignorable, except the ones that unlock a decent armor. From what I have heard there is also an ungodly amount of ground combat forces even if the game is generally simplistic in that regard, as in send fleet, bomb planet (planet can't do anything about orbital bombardment, no Indepence Day heroics here) and drop bog standard troops and planet fall easy. Some things feel missing like trade between planets in your control and outside. No options for colonizing either through tech, perk or planet specialization of toxic, volcanic and barren planets?Disconnect between events and what is really happing with aliens under your command: I decided to infiltrate a primitive government. And it was success. Event screen told me these aliens was overjoyed to join my empire and praised me as lord saviour Gaben etc. Great I thought, finally I have alien friends that don't hate me as part of main group in my Commonwealth of Man (human space baddies). Yet when I saw their planet afterwards, they were hating me more than any other alien race in galaxy. Quite the achievement. Some of it is because different ethos… Yet it's ridiculous considering what I done to rest of the galaxy regarding aliens listing, but not limited to: raiding, pillaging, brutal wars against peaceful populations, enslavement of an unholy number of alien subjects and purging dozen worlds (at least 1 species forever gone) over countless systems. So my new alien friends had to get a lesson instantly, even if they had endured none of the hardships for throwing away a future on top. Lesson being; friendship is mandatory and resistance is impolite.			"

The military route is fully fleshed out, dynamic, and interesting. Your ethea, traits, and neighbors actually matter. Everything matters.Can't wait to see what they'll do with diplomacy and economy routes in the future. Right now they feel a little underdeveloped, but compared to the 4x games I came from, they're still way better. Alliances aren't made of paper, but they're not permanent and unbreakable either. All the resources are important. You cultivate your empire and help it grow. You don't feel like a mechanic tweaking everything in this game. You feel like a parent, a ruler, or a gardener. The game feels alive.Highly recommended.			"

												I was a bit iffy about buying this game, as I've tried some other Paradox games, and just had a hard time getting into the complexity of them.  I wanted a more complex Civ, but not to the point of EU.  Stellaris really did that for me.  I write this review at about 60 hours and I'm not bored yet.  I have really enjoyed the game play so far, the variety of playstyles and races, etc.There are some points in the game that I would fix, but so far I think Paradox has been very responsive with their attempt to fix any bugs, and I have high hopes about them fixing some of the gameplay issues that I have run into (federation issues, diplomacy, etc.) considering how much I have seen them responding around Reddit and their forums.  Allowing mods is also a great thing for any game to do, in my opinion.			"

 GRAND STRATEGY ON A GALACTIC SCALE Stellaris is the game. A really good and great game, but it could be better. Customizing your empire is incredible, can customize to the smallest detail. Graphically not stand out, but it is not important here. The music is superb. The art of the game is great. Menus, interface... all polished. Has the Paradox touch, all the greatness of the 4x mixed with a real time strategic, very complex and fun. The problem here is that the game is unable to maintain that illusion, especially in the mid-game and at the end we have a game halfway between 4x and RTS, unfinished, giving that feeling of greatness, you have a lot to do, but without the depth you want.Things like diplomacy or trade has a important lack of depth for the moment (improvements announced). And the galaxy could look more live. I also think, even having an exaggerated number of skins, are too similar sometimes (need robots!)... many skins but you got pretty more different races on Endless Space for example. The governors, leaders, captains... looks too similar. There are things that are already there and I can see it is not what it should be. The game is great and awesome like I said before, don't misunderstand me, but is a Paradox game, so it can be more better. Sure, the paths will come, the DLC will expand the game and it will turn the game into something huge... but not for now, I would have liked more content in the release date.Said all this, the updates policy that have announced promises to transform the game in the best and biggest space-themed game 4x ever made, I can see it now, but with time... this game will be an strategic masterpiece.

												Having never played any of paradox' other games, or any grand strategy for that matter, I do find the game fun and surprisingly accessible.Gud:-Incredible sense of scale. Initially the galaxy seems impossibly large, and then latter almost confining as your empire expands.-Tech researching system: there are 3 categories of research that each have their own name, which I dont remember at all. Instead, I recognize them by their colors. There's Blue, which seems to have things like lasers, shields, drives, and sensor upgrades. Green, which has tech focused on developing planets, borders, governments, and armies. And then Yellow: missiles and rail guns and probably some other stuff. All 3 color tech lines get to be researched simultaneously. Presumably to keep things interesting, picking a tech to research is something of a lottery. You can only pick from the available 3-4(usually) techs to research, and it randomly changes everytime.-Empire creation system. Tons of options. You wont know what any of them mean for a long while, but that's ok. Just dive in and you'll figure it out.-Music is gud.-Graphix gud too, except for occasional issues.-""Fallen Empires"" add an interesting twist to games. A fallen empire is basically a near maxed out empire tech-wise and fleet-wise. Each one has a different trigger that will cause them to come out of seclusion and butt♥♥♥♥ the offender. Essentially, they add random rules to games, including ""dont touch their borders"", ""don't enslave other dudes"", ""don't randomly violate a percieved holy site(?)"" and others.-random story missions/events. These are a lot of fun. Too bad they seem to stop popping up in the late game.Not gud:-Some graphcial problems in the late game with very very large fleets not animating properly, which is kinda sad. Watching the space battles is one of the coolest parts of the game.-Trade UI is a little lacking. Would especially like to see the ""what would make this deal work?"" button from galciv.-Strangely missing features. What is probably the most disppointing thing about stellaris is not whats in it, but what isn't. Here's a non-exhaustive list of things one would expect to find in a game like this, but won't:*Trade routes. Completely missing. All trade is done through trade deals, no caravan/tradeship routes.*Espionage. The closest I coudl find is the ability to bribe or suppress seperatist factions. Otherwise, completely absent.*Religions. This one is especially strange as you can pick for your empire to be religious.*Varried victory conditions. Unless I'm missing something, the only 2 possible win scenarios are owning 40%+ of the galaxy or otherwise wiping out every other empire. While I'm not really a fan of the ""cultural"" victories from civ games, I think it wouldn't hurt to have other options for winning.So all in all, a very fun game. The biggest flaws are ones of omission. What's there right now is qutie solid and polished for the most part.			"

												VerdictIf you liked Playing Hearts of Iron or Europa Universe. Then yes it is for you. Same mechanics but space theme. The game is less complicated then Hearts of Iron or Europa. Non-less it is complicated from average RTS game you play. That is why it is called Grand Strategy game. The game become addictive once you start to learn its mechanics. Each game session days long. You can shorten it by decreasing the number of Star and NPC empires. But where is fun in that.  There is many ways you can play the game. Go all-out war with every nation you meet or find a diplomatic way to crush them all. Game can be improved is some aspects. Like tool tips are missing on crucial information. Although it is access able by this can be done the easy way. I am sure it will be fixed in next upcoming patches.  "

												I would give this game a tentative recommendation.I have enjoyed my playtime so far for the most part, not plagued with performance issues, though a few bugs. The game as it stands is a flawed gem, lots of things are done right, but a lot of things are also not fully fleshed out. I appreciate that a lot of things are on the way to being fixed and added, but that's not a great basis on which to release your ""finished product"".However, despite it's edges and sharp corners where ergonomics is desperately needed to streamline the interface and interactions with your empire, it's still a worthwhile buy. In time the purchase will become more and more worthwhile hopefully.So I recommend it's purchase, but don't expect the game to be firing on all cylinders right now as some game mechanics like trade and ""sectors"" need work.

												It's not often we get a game of this quallity that isn't afraid to let dumb people know they're dumb.  If you can't figure out the interface ya, you're probably dumb.  If you're getting blocked for resources you're one hundred percent dumb.  If navigating the map leaves you wondering where your fleets are, if you just can't figure out why that star system you where planing to colonize is no longer available to you....It's not the game.  It's you.  There is nothing wrong with the game.  You're a idiot.  It's ok though, because 90% of all games released since 2007 are tailored just for you.  Three buttons that actually matter surounded by five more that trick you into thinking you're doing something complex while giving you the option to spend real money to make things easier.That is not Stellaris.  Stellaris is for the 10%.  It's complex, beautifull, massive and glorious.Now if you'll excuse me I have a few alien races to culturally subvert into subserviance.			"

												I had never imagined that Stellaris would be such a great game. Having played other Paradox games such as Europa Universalis 4, Crusader Kings 2 and Victoria 2, I had expected a very intricated and complex game in terms of strategy, but Stellaris has accomplished much more than this. Firstly, Paradox managed to get the genre perfectly. Being a Star Trek fan, I can say that there are inumerous features that are very resembling to the world of the original series. The game, however, does not restrict itself to Star Trek and there are references to various other classical features of the genre. Regarding the other Paradox games, I feel that in Stellaris war is not so important and it in peace that you wil play most hours of the game (specially at the first decades). Of course, being a mix of grand strategy and 4X, Stellaris was expected to have  some exploration  mechanics, but Stellaris also have loads of ways to develop your empire at peace. Moreover, the complexity of the mechanics are fantastic. They are in no way difficult to learn and it is very fun to manage the social and political aspects of your empire. The empire creator is also amazing with a lot of different governments to choose in addition to ethics and general characteristics of your people. The AI empires react to your presence mainly according to their and your ideology which makes for very funny games. Finally, the UI is a thousand times more accessible than in past Paradox games and the tutorial does a good job, which in my view makes the game not so difficult to learn to newcomers to the grand strategy genre.

												This game is a gem! I've played tons of Master of Orion since I was a kid, Moo1, Moo2 and the new remake available on Steam. I've also played most of the 4X strategy games in the sci-fi genre and Stellaris has them beaten hands down. There are a few quirks with the empire management when you get further along your game and the learning curve can seem a bit steep, but the amount of content, the unforeseen events that keeps you on your toes and the customisation options for each gane you create is just stagering. I recommend it for anyone that have a deep love for 4X Strategy Games. Now if only I could find a game like this with real turned based tactical combat like the original Master Of Orion, I would be a happy camper!			"

												Great game! Amazing strategy game that goes very in depth from your species, to their name, government, research, colonizing, war, diplomacy , and so on. Only problem is that the game can be very very slow but due to lack of events and then other moments where everything seems to happen at once. Tutorial is great as it teaches you how to play but not necessarily how to win and can easily skip. Not for those with lack of patience.			"

												This is a great game, and mods turn it into a fantastic game. It brings Paradox's brand of grand strategy to space, and has turned out rather well. It has all the feeling of immersion of Paradox's historical titles, but is even more of a sandbox without any of the baggage of having to pay lip service to historical accuracy. It is well worth picking up during a sale, especially with major expos.Like all Paradox titles: it isn't a simple game, but is easy to get into if you are willing to just sit down and learn the rules of the game.Perhaps the biggest plus point of this game is the sandbox it provides. You have a great deal of choice when it comes to how to design your empire/species/military/government; and that's before you start, to say nothing about what happens during the course of a game. Recent updates and workshop mods greatly expand upon this. Whether you're the competitive type who wants to squeeze every last advantage he can in multiplayer, or the roleplayer who wants to replicate species from his favourite sci-fi franchises, there is something for you.Variation. Every game will involve some degree of exploration, colonisation, wars of conquest, strategic interventions, diplomacy, and tech/arms race. There is almost always something to do. There are tons of random events and strange systems you can stumble into while playing.Combat. Admittedly, armies and planetary invasions are rarely interesting, but this IS a space game. Fleet battles and movements are some of the most intense moments of the game, and fleet composition and formation can mean the difference between winning the war and watching your ships get annihilated.Multiplayer. This game is great on its own, but like pretty much all strategy games, playing with and against humans is where it truly shines. Additionally, I've noticed far less OOS problems with this game than certain other Paradox titles.There are of course still issues. While performance has greatly improved since initial release, it's still an issue as it is with all Paradox titles. The AI isn't too bright, and though it can be fun to play against for a couple of games, you'll want to play more multiplayer after singleplayer becomes too predictable. Some of the gameplay design decisions have been questionable, but fortunately on this point Paradox has thus far been excellent about listening to player feedback and is releasing updates to address them.

												This is an awesome game.  As an old Masters of Orion addict,  this is MOO on steroids.  The things I love about this game are 1) the huge number of star systems to explore, 2) an incredible number of technologies to research, 2) easy colonization from a list of eligible worlds, 3) colonies to manage, 4) interesting anomalies to research while exploring, 5) huge space battles, 5) dozens of other races to interact with, 6) an option to design your own race, and 7) ship design.    The downside to a long complex game is that it is very slow.  You can pause it at any time, and you can set the speed for passage of time from very slow to very fast.  I run it at very fast, about a day every 1/2 second, and it's still a long game.  In fact, I have yet to finish a game after 150+ hours of playing.  I admit that I stop a game when I run out of room to explore and expand.  The victory condition to control 40% of the habitable planets is a daunting goal in a galaxy of 600 star systems and around 50 races.  But I don't mind not playing a game to the end.  I like the early part of the game where you explore new worlds, find neat anomalies, and colonize worlds.The space battles are cool, but essentially, the strongest fleet wins.  There really are no strategic or tactical options for you to pick that give a less powerful fleet a chance to win against a stonger foe.  It's possible that I just haven't found (or researched) them yet, but the standard ship tactics are Corvettes charge in and get destroyed, Destroyers and Cruisers are intermediate, while Battleships stand back and shoot the big guns/beams/missiles.      The things I could do without to make the game less complex are political factions (dealing with unruly populations is a pain), and the very low number of colonized worlds you can control (starts with 5, research adds a few more).  You do get to assign excess colonies to new sectors, which manage themselves.     I really appreciate that Stellaris is very player-friendly.  It provides information, explanation, and feedback.  If you try to do something you can't do, it will tell you WHY you can't do it.  For example, if you send a scientist to survey an anomoly, and then forget and send another scientist to do the same thing, it tells you that a scientist is already doing it.  If you try to declare war on someone when you can't (like having a non-agression  agreement in place), it informs you why.  If you can't upgrade a building, it will tell you the reason you can't upgrade it (need tech or some pre-requisite).  As a player, I appreciate knowing why things don't work or can't be done.    If you like large, complex space game with a lot of options and interesting events, I recommend this game highly.			"

												Stellaris is a game where you colonize and conquer the galaxy with interstellar travel, research, and war. In short, it's a mixture between a typical Paradox game like Europa Universalis IV and a Civilization game -- it's probably what Civilization: Beyond Earth should have been.In my first game, I was able to make a fanatical spiritualist and somewhat collectivist society with a divine mandate, which I termed the Papal State, and which was led by Pope Francis III. I colonized several planets, killed some space pirates, and found out we're not alone in the universe. It's a very interesting game, and though I'm generally not a fan of science fiction, I would recommend it.			"

												Great game. Had a lot of fun and I would definitely recommend this game for people who like strategy games and paradox games in general. I believe it would be a good game to start with if you are new to the genre.The goodRace Creator is awesome Anomalies are entertaining and funnyGeneral gameplay is smooth and has easy to use UIIts a space game!  Interesting Tech pathsModding is awesomeThe bad Repetitive at certain stages of the game Space Battles are just giants blobs right now Diplomacy is not great for Advanced beings?A proper message alert system would be great like other paradox gamesThe reason why this is such a good game is because it has huge modding potential and you know paradox will release DLC even if it is a bit price high just wait for specials and you will be sweet. Happy space exploration!!! All hail the Prethoryn Queen.			"

												the tl;dr is that you need to play this game if you like si-fi or grand strategy or if you have a big imagination and you need an excuse to dissapear from the face of the earth for 100+ hoursthe longer version of that is that this game is fantastic. My biggest reason for loving it is that it appeals so well to my desire to roleplay. After 500 hours it's still surprisingly difficult to find yourself in the exact same situation that you've been in before. There's just enough RNG right now that you can go from being a martial dictatorship that ends up granting large liberties to its people and forms a federation with several large powers, including an ancient fallen empire and in your next game end up with a scientific republic fighting against overwhelming odds as they become trapped within their borders by two spiteful empires. For some people the game will seem shallow, but the imagination of this game is what truly makes the experience memorable. Things like what I described above are things you may never experience and you'll end up with a whole different story, like being a genocide-obsessed demon race that teams up with xenophilic monkeys to prevent a god-like empire from overwhelming the galaxy.

												With update 1.2.4 out:Pros:-Early game is fantastic!-Exploration of the galaxy is fun.-The tutorial is very well implemented and actually really useful and good. This is a first for a Paradox game that I've seen.-The war goals -system, which is a Paradox norm, works surprisingly well in a 4x game.-Ship design is well-implemented and fun.Cons:-Mid game onwards there is not much to do at the moment. Only 2 victory conditions to strive to (conquest & domination) makes it seem more like a really polished beta than an actual fleshed out and completed game right now. Knowing Paradox this'll change in the future with various patched, dlc and expansions.-Research point saving/accumulating does not work correctly with regards to back-to-back special projects. This with being forced to have the AI run the majority of your empire (you can only directly control 5+ star systems in a galaxy of 400, 600, 800  etc. systems) makes it so you are forced to play ""enjoy the ride"" instead of ""the optimal way"".-Diplomacy is very limited. This is paired with very, very repetitive and limited AI empire leader personalities makes for a dull system. Well, atleast it works fine with the only possible victory conditions so there's that. -Limited tactical possibilities in space combat, non-existent in ground combat/planet invasions.			"

												EDIT: I nominated this for the ""Just 5 More Minutes"" award. This game truly does eat your time. Just see my playtime so far.TL:DR - If you like space 4X games, this gives Master of Orion 2016 (what I'd call a gold standard) a run for it's money.What I liked about the game - Once I understood the resource system, the game is great. In the start of a play session, it really makes you think about how you're going to expand. For being a ""real time with a pause button"" system, I feel the gameplay is actually slower pace than Turn Based Master of Orion, which can escalate very quickly if you know what you're doing. And the race generation system really lets you fine tune your playstyle with the mix of Ethos, Governments, and race bonuses. And these choices help determine what space empires you'll be friendly with as you progress through the game. The diplomacy is also decent, with many strategic options in building negotiations.Also of note, the mod community for this game is awesome and any ""bugs"" or issues you might have with the playstyle have been tweaked by the community. So that's a big plus.And for a game that doesn't have much in the way of ""story"", in my big 1000 star 100+hour playthrough it's not hard for a lot of personal narratives to play out between AI sessions thanks to how diplomacy works. That nation you didn't get along with will start warming to you when you start war with their long term rivals. And ""End Game"" events make things even more interesting.And call me crazy, but I believe that ""Paradox"" is a trustworthy name in the game industry. Maybe some of their games are ""DLC laden"", but the positive is that they support their games for years and I could see this series being supported for some time. And at a price that's under what a normal AAA game will cost you, I believe this game has a lot of value at the $40 price point and below. And even though at time of writing this I'm +140hrs in, I could see myself easily logging 1000+ hours into this as I already have future playthroughs planned. I've bought a ALOT of games. But this one definately keeps my attention like few others do.What could use some work - I think the space combat could use a bit more polish. I wish it was more tactical. But supposedly that's even being addressed in a future patch.			"

												>Short Version: Stellaris is pretty much what you'd get if Master of Orion II and Spore had a baby. That's right, friggin SPORE with its absurdly vast galaxy inhabited by hundreds of procedurally generated spacefaring civilzations with a wide diversity of philosophies and personalities that determine how they interact with the player and eachother (and just like Spore there are also pre-spaceflight races that you can interact with). After installing the game I spent a good 5 hours in the empire editor creating dozens of customized alien civilizations to fill my games with.- Overall a very solid 4x space game that I would recommed to any fan of the the 4x space genre - (only during a Steam Sale, of course; I make a personal point of never buying anything over $20 at full price on Steam) - However, if you're a Paradox fan looking for EU4 or CK2 but IN SPAAAAAACE!!!, this ain't it. <<DISCLAIMER>>: Stellaris is not truely as vast in scale as Spore and is only absurdly huge by traditional 4x space standards: the maximum galaxy size in Stellaris is 1,000 solar systems vs Spore's mind-boggling 500,000 solar systems, and whereas the number of potential empires in Spore feels pretty much limitless, the maximum number of AI empires you can set in Stellaris is 39 for a maximum sized galaxy.<<DOUBLE DISCLAIMER>>: This number does not include pre-FTL spaceflight civs, pre-sentient upliftable races, the precurser Fallen empires, or additional empires formed from liberated/rebelling worlds, so there can be more than just 39 other empires in the galaxy as the game progresses.>Long Version: <AKA Rant, AKA TL;DR>Once again, this game is NOT Europa Universalis! Off of the top of my head there are only three main things that Stellaris and EU4 have in common that aren't ubiquitous to the 4x genre in general:- There IS an Ironman mode, and you need to have it enabled to earn achievements. (Hillariously I didn't notice I wasn't earning any achievements until I was 40 hours into my first run)- A wargoal/warscore%/demands warfare system similar to EU4, except you don't need CBs, both the attacker and defender can choose multiple wargoals, and the demands you make during peace deals must be chosen from the wargoals you laid out at the start of the war.- You might never actually ""complete"" a playthrough from start to finish due to the absurd length of the game: In EU4 you'll probably become unstoppable long before 1821 and get bored with world conquest; in Stellaris there's no time limit and there's an entire friggin GALAXY to conquer!In other words...If you go into Stellaris expecting a fully-pached version of EU4 set in outer space, complete with a realistically overly-complicated global economy with trade goods/trade routes/trade power/piracy, insane amounts of micro-management or sectors that work like Cossack-esque estates, in-depth religious wars with fleshed-out religions, random events and disastors that can turn your empire upside-down, and all that other good stuff - you're going to be sorely disappointed. > If you're expecting a straightforward 4x space game along the lines of Endless Space or Galactic Civilizations, you'll be pleasantly surprised by what Stellaris DOES has to offer: - gameplay on a truely galactic scale, ala Spore- an incredible diversity of possible alien races with uncountable combinations of ratial traits, climate preferences, philosophies, and government types (again, similar to Spore)- 90+ species avatars across 6 phenotypes (mammalian, reptilian, avian, arthropod, molluscoid, and fungoid)- 20+ distinct AI personalites, determined by an empire's traits, ethos, and government type.(this game really does have a lot in common with Spore's space stage; just take away the spice-trading economy, and toss in more conventional space 4x features, like a tech tree, space stations, space whales, and massive fleets with adjustable loadouts)- the ability to study, infiltrate, and/or uplift pre-ftl civilizations- the ability to genetically modify individual populations to change their traits and climate preferences, or grant intelligence to pre-sentient lifeforms so they can join your empire.- complex diplomacy that includes just about every option I've seen in the 4x genre: NAPs, mutual defense pacts, alliances, federations, protectorates, vassalization, tributaries, guaranteeing/supporting independance, research agreements and open migration treaties.- slavery, forced relocation and ethnic cleansing of indivual populations on planet tiles- policies that determine an empire's stance on ethical matters such as slavery, forced relocation, and ethnic cleansing.(you can outright outlaw these things and force other empires to do the same via wargoals)- a unique card-based research system can can only be described by the wiki: http://www.stellariswiki.com/Technology- EVERYTHING that gets destroyed in outer space leaves behind salvage that can be studied and possibly reverse-engineered by science ships for extra research opportunities (this includes random alien encounters like space whales and giant space amoebas) - SECTORS: love 'em or hate 'em, here's a link with tips on how to deal with them:https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellaris/comments/4j0sm6/sector_tips/(info might be somewhat dated due to patches and bugfixes)- varying means of FTL travel ala Sword of the Stars / Star Ruler- More si-fi referances than you can shake a lightsaber at: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShoutOut/StellarisOn the flop side, there are also some features you would probably expect from the 4x-space genre that are noticably absent: - There's no trade economy AT ALL. You can trade resources with other empires by putting energy credits, minerals, and strategic resources on the table during diplomatic trade agreements, but there's nothing in this game akin to trade routes, space freighters, or trade stations. - No trading for individual technologies between empires. You can reverse engineer their tech, but you can't trade for it. - Stellaris has a food resource for growing populations, but surplus food cannot be shared between colonies (probably because there aren't any trade routes or freighters to move the food with, which is pretty funny in hindsight).- No diplomatic or science victory conditions. Personally, I think Paradox took the whole 4x thing a little too literrally. The only victory options are Conquest (conquer or subjugate all other civilizations) and Domination (own 40% of all inhabitable planets in the galaxy) In other words, once you get past the Exploration, Expansion, and Explotation phases, you're pretty much stuck with Extermination; there's nothing even close to resembling a science victory and the closest thing you can get to a diplomatic victory is via vassalizing and/or integrating everyone else. In all fairness to the negative reviews, I can see how the whole ""conquer a hundred empires and take over thousands of planets"" thing with long truces between wars of aggression can get tediously repetitive, especially if the remaining empires get boiled down to two super-power federations slugging it out once every election cycle. Again, one of the only things Stellaris has in common with EU4 is that you can reach a point where you're unbeatably strong, but are still forced to spend an inordinate amount of time playing through to the end if you actually want to ""achieve victory."" There's a reason why Paradox didn't create a Steam achievement for actually beating this game. That rant might have ended on a low note, but I still give Stellaris a solid positive review. Paradox has done a great job of resolving most of the bugs and issues in a (mostly) timely fastion, and so far all of the new non-cosmetic features have been patched in completely free of charge, resulting an a decently polished and thoroughly enjoyable game.

												Just don't listen to negative reviews. This game is pure awesomeness. Good job Paradox! But surely It can improve, still I like the current state. The book was awesome too, lore is great for an strategy game(?). And It's extremely addictive, since the ''rpg'' title added when the first alpha launch. You'll have an connection with your own-created species and empire. So Do I recommend it? Yeah I sure do but don't buy it unless you aren't into space, or strategy, rpg games. And also don't buy it if you are an impatient guy.			"

												After a short amount of playtime, I'd like to offer my impressions of this game and why I recommend it - for people that will enjoy a game of this type.I have always had difficulty with Paradox games because I get to a point with all I have to learn and I go ""screw it, I'm gonna play CS:GO"".  While I enjoy strategy games (a long time Civ player), Paradox games have always been on another level.  Usually when you read user reviews for games like Europa Universalis, you'll often see a comment about the learning curve.What I enjoy about Stellaris is that, while there still is a learning curve, Stellaris is more inviting that other Paradox games, while still maintaining it's depth.As far as commenting on the other aspect of the game, I'll be, in fairness, general due to the amount of time that I have played/the game has been released.  This game borrows from a few different space strategy games that I have played, such as Galactic CIvilizations, and puts them together quite nicely.Lastly, as a final comment: I usually distain the ship design portion of space strategy games.  They have always been bulky and sort of difficult to manage sometimes.  Stellaris does it right.  You can customize your modules as you wish, or if you do not have any interest in this, there is a button that will simply press the best modules available so you don't have to worry about it.  But, if you do want to worry about it, you can, to your heart's content.			"

												I lost track of time during my most recent game-play.  The fun doesn't really start until you jump into Multiplayer.  Just like LoL and going against AI, playing Stellaris on single-player is good to learn everything you would need to know, and can be loads of fun when AI empires go to war with you where their military power is inferior.  But, the real fun comes when you join a networked game of 8-10 folks.  If you like RTS (real-time strategy) games that take place in space, you need to play Stellaris.  Just make sure to set an alarm for yourself, or you will be sucked in for hours.			"

												Stellaris is a game where you colonize and conquer the galaxy with interstellar travel, research, and war. In short, it's a mixture between a typical Paradox game like Europa Universalis IV and a Civilization game -- it's probably what Civilization: Beyond Earth should have been.In my first game, I was able to make a fanatical spiritualist and somewhat collectivist society with a divine mandate, which I termed the Papal State, and which was led by Pope Francis III. I colonized several planets, killed some space pirates, and found out we're not alone in the universe. It's a very interesting game, and though I'm generally not a fan of science fiction, I would recommend it.			"

Interesting Tech pathsModding is awesomeThe bad Repetitive at certain stages of the game Space Battles are just giants blobs right now Diplomacy is not great for Advanced beings?A proper message alert system would be great like other paradox gamesThe reason why this is such a good game is because it has huge modding potential and you know paradox will release DLC even if it is a bit price high just wait for specials and you will be sweet.

												the tl;dr is that you need to play this game if you like si-fi or grand strategy or if you have a big imagination and you need an excuse to dissapear from the face of the earth for 100+ hoursthe longer version of that is that this game is fantastic. My biggest reason for loving it is that it appeals so well to my desire to roleplay. After 500 hours it's still surprisingly difficult to find yourself in the exact same situation that you've been in before. There's just enough RNG right now that you can go from being a martial dictatorship that ends up granting large liberties to its people and forms a federation with several large powers, including an ancient fallen empire and in your next game end up with a scientific republic fighting against overwhelming odds as they become trapped within their borders by two spiteful empires. For some people the game will seem shallow, but the imagination of this game is what truly makes the experience memorable. Things like what I described above are things you may never experience and you'll end up with a whole different story, like being a genocide-obsessed demon race that teams up with xenophilic monkeys to prevent a god-like empire from overwhelming the galaxy.

												let me share you the story of Karl Wolf, President of the United Human Space Republic, elected over (approx.) 15+20 times this guy would just not die. My first ruler, Octavian I ony lasted one term then promptly keeled over and died, however President Wolf even through cycles where he lost support, continuallly got elected just after 1 term of a different president. Eventually I got tired to spending any influence, and Wolf became reelected 9 more times. When I saw that he was the ripe old age of 93 I told myself this dude has to go, he's going to keel over and die any minute so I supported a new candidate the next election. Note, in my republic scientists and governors alike had to my knowlege never made it into their 90's even with the longevity perk.Lo and behold, old age isn't going to keep this guy from the presidency so after 1 term from the new president I thought he had already died. I made a critical mistake of not monitoring the election, and the next time I looked old Karl Wolf was back at it again at the age of 97. At this point I was amazed, so I just let him rule with no interference and he made it through 2 more elections before he finally clocked out at an insane 108 years of age.I highly recommend this game, people will talk about the games mechanics (Honestly, they're great) and all that in other reviews but I actually wanted to share the story of my eternal president. He oversaw the republic rise from a tiny 1 planet system to the juggernaught that had almost 200 pops, through war and peace, and didn't stop overseeing it until he died in office.I'm only 16 hours in at the time of writing this and this is the kind of story I can write about this game.

												Age of Wonders 3, Endless Legend, EU, CK 2, The many Civs; I've played and loved them all for slightly different reasons. And I can say Stellaris sits comfortably amongst this group as the sort of game you think about when you're travelling to work, when you're watching TV, When your wife is asking if you put the rubbish out. It's a game with so many layers and so much to do. Sure it has some faults - a paucity of events in the mid-game, lots of busy work, but these pale compared to the epic sweep and constant allusions to concepts created by the great sci-fi authors after which the updates are named. It's like a beautiful woman with slightly buck teeth - look for the good, don't worry about perfection, take her home!! "

												I want to say ""EU IV in space"" but it's definitely a different flavour despite the fairly familiar gameplay. It keeps most of the complexity, without feeling simplified.For those not overly familiar with Europa Universalis, Stellaris is definitely top-of-the-class along with Endless Space as the ultimate 4x space game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate).Fairly easy to get the hang of, there's lots to master and lots of different ways to play - and this combined with the traditionally fantastic mod support that comes with Paradox titles means Stellaris will live a long and well-worn life in my library.If you like space, and you like grand strategy, then you'll definitely like this. Fair warning though - I probably can't recommend it to someone who can never game for more than an hour at a time.			"

												This isn't your normal 4X... This is advanced 4X.It took me awhile to get the hang of this game, and truth be told, I still am. Despite that, though, it's a very enjoyable game! I've had about three playthroughs so far, and it never gets old. My only complaint is that diplomacy can get a bit... Boring. That, and war. I wish there was a bit of variety in this! Again, despite all that, this game is pretty great. The race creator is fun, the music is great, and the graphics are pretty stellar. Pardon the pun. One of my favorite things to do is create a massive empire, create stability in the galaxy, and then throw that all away and watch as the galaxy crumbles. Sure, it is pretty cruel, but it's fun to study the political structure 10, 20, or even 150 years after your empire has collapsed! This game offers a ton of diversity and variety, but it still lacks in some areas. I'd give it a 7/10.			"

Surprisingly complex set of features and mechanics that feels polished  , satisfying and fulfilling on release. The framework is set for proceeding additions.Update: As predicted previously this game only gets better as more mechanics are fleshed out throughout the game.While I do have to admit that I have not played the late game as I keep restarting games to optimize my early and mid-game starts. I would like to share my thoughts on Stellaris so far.It is easily apparent that Paradox have put a lot of work to create a framework that consists of different modules and mechanics, from a development perspective this should allow Paradox to easily add more to the game when it comes to complexity and tuning(not that there are any major issues at the moment).A lot of people are complaining about mid-game being stale, I do not find this to be the case. Once the mid-game comes along I find myself trying to maximize naval capacity and have a fleet that is nearing that cap, being Militarist I put it to use. Wars are fast and furious, while it is not just about your naval fleet but also paying attention to your defensive and offensive armies. While I do admit that the AI is horrible some folks are already trying to optimize it via the LUA files and with some work from Paradox it is easily fixable more intelligence is added via IF-THEN statements.In the current state the game plays fantastic, early game is fantastic and you will find yourself addicted to surveying systems to find high resource stations and decent planets and you will shout in glee once you find that 20+ Gaia planet. At normal speed there is plenty of tasks and micromanagement to keep your hands full at every second (day in the game) of every moment. Up the speed to Fast and you will have your hands full.From a multiplayer aspect there are folks whining about corvette rushes, while this is an issue it is easily fixable by boosting the military power of stations and spaceports so that early corvette rushes get thwarted. I am sure there are others with even better solutions. Other than that MP is fantastic, I have been playing in the Stellaris MP steam group(shameless shoutout) and matches with 12+ players are running smoothly. Having this many players in a game along with 15AI to add some action to the early game gives the galaxy a feeling that it is very alive. The salt,politics and drama in voice chat are satisfying while everybody starts to fight over optimal planets/resources and federations begin to form.While upkeep costs exist they do not hinder your science output if you keep your energy credits above 0, you can still sim city while being aggressive in the galaxy. Small things like research alternatives give an addictive randomness to the game and you will find yourself swearing at RNGJesus when you don't get that specific tech you needed.This game is extremely satisfying and provides the excitement and adrenaline that so many other games in the sea of 4x/Grand Strategy do not provide. In the coming months and years I can see this game molding into one of the staples of the genre.Issues that need to be fixed:- MP balance issues (corvettes evasion is overpowered, worm hole is superior in relation to other initial FTL tech , Energy weapons generally outclass missles and kinetic weaponry)- Spaceport , mining bases and early game defense is weak causing early rushes to be a problem- Peace mechanics can be abused to stop players from joining a federation- Number of planets does not scale well with science output (2% increase for every planet) , and there is no way to remediate this causing issues for Wide empires.Nominated: For Test of Time award			"

												THE best grand strategy game i have ever played by far. The few problems i had with the game design have been patched and it is fantastic. The moment i saw all the options to create your own custom empire i was hooked, and mods expand it even further in various ways. The option to adjust the speed of the game is great as well. You can start out slow to learn the game at your own pace then speed it up significantly once you know what you're doing. Some of the in-game random events and discoveries can get a tad repetitive, but you can quickly dismiss them without delay so that is a very minor issue since the real meat of the game is exploration and interacting with the other major powers. The only thing this game seems to be missing are subterfuge options such as spying and assassination. If you can afford the price tag, i consider this a must buy.			"

												I desperately want to change my review to ""Recommend,"" but in its current state (7/10/2016, ver. 1.2.1) Stellaris is one gigantic cocktease of a 4x game. I have played through the game four times, but cannot bring myself to continue the most recent playthrough. Quite simply, the time required to play a single game is not proportionate with how basic a lot of the systems are: from combat to colonization to diplomacy to trade to research, everything feels like a placeholder for a more complex version of itself. If I'm going to sink 20+ hours into a single playthrough, I should be discovering and struggling with new things the whole way through, but once I reach the midgame the game basically plays itself: build auto-designed battleships, colonize my planets, divide into sectors, upgrade my buildings, declare war to slowly chew away at my neighbors, and eventually kill the endgame menace (which is not guaranteed to show up). The game is exciting at the beginning but never expands its mechanics to match its scale.Maybe Paradox will release patches/DLC to flesh out all of these systems, but as it is the game ends up playing in a very straightforward manner that is disappointing given the scope. For example, Sins of the Solar Empire had a more engaging lategame due to multiple win cons and competitive enemies. As it is, even playing Stellaris as a sandbox is boring because of bland enemy interactions (trade or declare war, that's about it).As it is, I'll fire it up again when it receives a major patch/DLC, or when a full-conversion 40k mod exists, at which point I'll re-evaluate my review. Until then, I would recommend that people wait on this game.			"

												This is my first review, and I thought I'd throw my 2 cents in as the reviews seem to be mixed on both main forums of paradox and here. The game its self is O.K. I can't praise it as I would like, but then again I can't really be too negative about it. The game, as all games these days when released, have to have a bit of work done to them to smooth the bumps etc and Stellaris is no different.The potential seems very high, and I no doubt that it will reach it over time. But, for now, the game for me is seriously lacking in content - especially mid game and it becomes more of a chore than an enjoyment. There are also quite a few bugs, but paradox aren't wasting too much time getting around to them and their next major patch seems to tackle alot of the issues that exist as well as improving the content and meta of the game.It's definitely one of those that you have to take a chance on and I will be eagerly waiting in anticipation for how the game turns out and the journeys it will take me on trying to explore all it's possibilities.Do your research, and watch those vids that are hugely available that will show you the games environment and situation currently.

												Stellaris is a game with a lot of potential. The late-game crises, even with a lack of variety, are particularly amazing. It's a 4X geared for atmosphere rather than competitive balance. What's lacking is a lot of mid-game content and flavour. Wars after the early game are pretty boring because it's inevitably one huge battle where if you win it's slowly bombarding and invading planets one by one. There is no meaningful diplomacy or espionage and no real relationships between the AI other than alliance blocs. The tech tree is neat but after 1 playthrough you'll have seen almost everything which is a real shame given the breadth of SCI-FI available. It doesn't just feel like you're choosing a tech path. The laser/kinetic/missile balance also still needs work.  That said there's a very strong modding community and Paradox will continue to pump out partially free DLC. I'd buy it if you can justify having 1 or 2 playthroughs and coming back in 6 months when a couple of patches are out or if you're willing to heavily mod it/			"

Its incredibly challenging has a lot of interesting aspects and a reasonable learning curve.I think the game would lack major replay however if it wasn't for the amazing modding community. If you can get this game during the summer steam sale its 100% worth the price tag.			"

												If you like grand strategy in a sci-fi setting then Stellaris is calling! It has a lot of customization for factions (genetic traits, ethical preferences, goverrnment type and policies) and plenty of in game features to explore (robot populations and giving them rights or having them rebel, uplifting pre-sentient species, fallen empires).The galaxy maps are ridiculously huge, the tiny map has over 100+ star systems which each have multiple planets or other objects in them. The game has you exploring them with Enterprise like science ships that require leaders to be successful. There are also a number of natural phenomena and space liforms that keep things exciting.The tech-tree is pretty straight forward divided into three branches of physics, social/biological, and engineering. Ships are designable or you can have the computer make basics and upgrade them to the best available tech. Rare techs are fun and keep things interesting, an example is psionic tehcnology and ground troops. Policy stances are fun too, you can either fight to enslave the galaxy or emancipate it, purge Xenos or welcome them, live by the Prime Directive or bring stone-age civs to space-faring vassal states to name a few!Combat is a bit simplistic, ordering fleets into battle in systems with no tactical control. I prefer this given the games huge scope but it might be a turn-off to others. Planets upgrades are grid-based zones with populations and improvements. Once you start getting a lot of colonies you can bin them in a sector and have it automate their economics which very helpful. I think the interface and tools like sectors make managing your empire feel less daunting than other 4X games.This is a fantastic real-time strategy game that will eat your free time like the best of the turn based grand strategies!

												OK, this game is awesome.  On the surface it seems like a very simplistic iPad tap and manage game, but you have to have an imagination when you play to fully appreciate it.  You have the moral dillemnas, do you enslave a populace, or do you let them try to regulate their own political system of governance?  What about lesser lifeforms and pre-warp civilizations, what about then?  Do you let them live on their own, do you scan them and learn anthropology passivley, do you try to ""uplift"" them and integrate them into your own workforce, do you completely purge them from your resources, or worse yet, enslave them and send them to the mines?  That little bit won me over.  It ignites the Star Trek geek in me.  Are you the Federation, the Cardassians or are you some godlike precurser race viewed by them as gods?  Hey we're just ""wormhole aliens"" but if you want to see us as gods, then by all the means, add to our empire!  The combat system reminds me of a cross between Settlers and Deadlock 2.  You have the military might? send them in and a brief standoff occurs.  You win or lose.  They may send more at your borders, so be prepared to defend them.  Military is wasted inside your borders.  Lots of little popup mini-quests like pirates or heretic spawn within your borders, so have an inside fleet to deal with those.  For the most part it's the simple age-old empire building of gather resources, build militaryl, defend and build and conquer.  But what I love mosst about this game are the random events and the micromanagement.  Kind of like Civilization III, but with a sector by sector grid of battles vs. the wider spread of ships and such.  Some lets me down, some feels more fun.  It's a fun game in any sense.  What I DO wish, is that there were more victory conditions than mere expansionism and conquest.  I play this game, and I wish I could be more peaceful and mercantile.  I wish I could meet other races and form a federation.  As it stands (and I may be wrong since I just bought it a day ago) is that you build power and sieze it.  I want to be the good guy and uplift civilizations, make them my own, and I want to hash out alliances and trade empires, build more than destroy.  That's my only beef with this game, it seems too straightforward kill them all, ala Settlers 7.			"

												Oh manIt's three seperate research trees that you can specialize your race forIt's being able to make a race of peace loving spiders or hatefull blobs, theocratic fox people or Isolationist mushrooms, basically whatever you could hope for.It has the war justification/retalliation demands of EU4Rebels are diverse and a real threat, not because they are going to conquer you, but they soften you up, sometimes make you abolish slavery, and that sucks when your empire is primarily racist space parots.You can change your government type. You probobly wont, but you can.Sectors were pretty bad but they've gotten better (the AI component to controling your empire as it gets big)It's just great, and more is on the way. Thanks ParadoxConsHard mode can become impossible mode when the computer next to you is the ""Evangalizing Zealot"" type and get's an early start, but normal mode can still be a challenge.Like other Paradox grand strategy, game runs really slow in the late late game, but you can lower the game speed below normal speed if you want to watch your fleet engage the enemy and be able to see what's going on without graphical errors.Early game is exciting, mid game is dangerously thrilling, but the late game isn't as thrilling to say the least. There are some fun events that i'm not going to spoil, but at some point the game seems pretty decided. My empire of racist space parots, despite being riddled with rebel factions trying to gain footing, have a fleet that's pretty unstopable, even against the pseudo-alliance that's been made with the other nations.On that note, Federations seem less common now, Some nations just won't ally outside their accepted ethics to form a federation, even in the face of impending racist parot-related doom.Overview: 9/10 Racist Parot empire becomes the strongest nation, dosen't bother annexing the rest of space, starts a new game as a new race. Spent a lot of time in the empire creator making more nations then I'll ever play.			"

												This is one of my favorite games right now. The visuals are stunning and the huge map really make this game great. There's a few mechanics like the War Score system that I really don't like and the mid-game is a bit bland but I'm sure this will be fixed eventually. If it isn't, there's always mods. The only thing that I feel this game is really missing though is other victory conditions than just controlling the map. If it had something similar to Civ V where you can win in multiple different ways by focusing in different areas that could be cool, but it might take some balancing to get right. Overall this game is a solid 8/10  and with mods and the coming updates it's pretty much going to be a 10/10.			"

												Definitely one of the best space 4X games around. It's a lot more ""newbie-friendly"" than a lot of other Paradox games and focuses a lot on the total cutomization of your race, its politics, and its journey, as well as lots of story-heavy elements; this is opposed to stuff like Endless Space, where the factions have a set-in-stone lore, appearance, and playstyle. It makes you feel almost like you're directing your very own space opera. Want to be a race of fanatical religious zealots who nuke every other race they come across into dust? You can do it. Want to be super friendly and found the Space UN then sing Kumbaya around a holographic fire? You can do it (although, be warned, the diplomacy system needs some TLC). Want to be Space North Korea and huddle in one corner of the galaxy and shoot anything th at comes in range? You can do that too. The main thing I enjoy about Stellaris, in order, are 1) the customization, 2) the storytelling, and 3) the roleplaying.And on top of that, it's a pretty solid, fun 4X to boot.			"

I first pirated Stellaris, then bought it including the DLC to support them.Never regretted my decision.Pros:Amazing visuals (along with the graphical mods)Really newbie-friendly, even casuals might fall in love with thisAddicting, if I'd add my pirated hours to the Steam hours, I'd probably get over a hundred, since every gameplay can be so diverse.The roleplay possibilities are so great that you won't stop playing it.Cons Repetitive early game because everything seems so familiar with the text stories A handful of bugs that weaken the plot-point of an objective Late-game will destroy old computers. Mid-game to late-game can be boring in some waysFinal verdict: 9/10 Recommended as ♥♥♥♥.Buy now! The content is too damn good. "

												I really enjoy the game from time to time. Especially if you start a new game you have a lot of stuff to do, which isn't really repetitive. Altrough after a while it becoms a bit repetitive. While I gave this game a positive review, this is not a game for everyone.Due to the sheer size of a galaxy in general, it is difficult to not create confusion and complexity in general. So here I am going to discuss some things that I think can be done better.Situation log It took me 45 hours to understand that the situation log is a very important thing. Although I have no idea how you could improve the importance of it. Maybe create another side panel at the left with important situations?A fleet manager At this point managing a fleet is really annoying, especially if you like round numbers. I would like to see some kind of manager that allows me to create a fleet, and tell me what resources, ships, etc have to be dedicated to it. At this moment everything is kinda mixed in to the right side panel, the fleet selection menu and the space station menu. This could be simplified by having 1 menu, where you select the amount of ships you want in your fleet. Upon clicking that the fleet manager should order all space stations to build these ships and order them to merge with the fleet. This should reduce the time needed to build fleets, which really make sense if you have 27 space stations that can build your ships really fast. Sector management While I really like the idea of sectors, and it sounds logic to me that the higher government only can rule about a certain amount of planets. I really would like to see the stats of the sector planets, and modify their layout at the cost of influence meaby? It doesn't make sense that the higher government can not interfere with problems on a certain planet.			"

												So, normally 4X games arent my thing. But this game is great. From creating your race and their political alignment, to the discovery of new star systems. Trying to uphold shaky alliances, while you wage war upon others. The game is pretty dynamic,  no 2 games of mine have been the same. The in-game events aren't that varied and the mid-game can lose one's interest a bit. But theres always something else to do - the ship designer keeps me busy! Depending on your choices for warp travel, race, policies and political alignment - you can find yourself playing a varied game each time! One down side to the game is that it will sap your time away. Start your own Sci-Fi story now!			"

												good mods will make an already immersive game even more so. enjoyUpdate: Very immersive game that will definitely have you building a story along the way as you play.  The events and leaders and just every little thing adds up to a beautifully epic space novella.  There are many different ways to play (peaceful diplomats or xenophobic militarists - the possibilites are nearly endless).  DLC's are getting better and better.  If you don't agree with paying the money for the extra content well, I don't know what to tell you... Paradox pretty much sets the bar for the industry in terms of ""price-to-amount of content"" ratio.			"
