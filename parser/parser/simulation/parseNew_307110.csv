Early Access Review
								This game is very promising for an Early Access game. The devs clearly waited for the game to be in an ACTUAL playable state, and with friends with this a BLAST. I am ususally busy (I am currently clinically depressed, so I'm either at school or asleep) but when I have time THIS is the game I've been playing the most. After finishing the final boss I have to say this game takes some practice but it is not Don't Starve levels of difficulty. I'd say it can be a casual game, but don't expect to get very far on your first run. A few problems (mainly with networking and server issues) and some placeholders (for bosses, mainly, but they still work very well as bosses. They're all larger and deadlier regular enemies execpt for one, and one of them is too cool for me to really even say it's just a regular enemy.) All of the 4 jobs on the ship are fun, but some seem more appealing at first, be prepared for bickering over who gets to be gunner and pilot. or maybe my friends are all just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. "

Early Access Review
								Just played a nearly three hour game, beat twelve full levels before the host had to leave.Once you gte far enough, the bosses are easier to kill than the enemies, and if you upgrade your sub enough you feel like a god among sea monsters. While the difficulty progression and level variation may need some work, this is one of the only Early Access games that I will fully and whole-heartedly support and recommend. It's a fantastic time to sit down with friends and knock out a few levels, the devs are on top of things with frequent updates, and while character models may need some work with texture overlap, I love the art style.Bottom line, I love this game and you should buy it, it has a lot of potential.

								The concept of the game is great, the art style is too. There's a real sense of adventure when playing with friends on comms. There are issues regarding connecting to games at the moment, but it's stable once you're in a game, or at least has been for me. Unfortunately, a lack of content at the moment, means that while the first dive is amazing, it gets rather repetitive after that. The item system feels rather basic. Item pickups with randomised stats would be a welcome addition.If they can add enough content so that every dive feels like a unique experience, it'll be fantastic. Still worth getting for those first few plays, but don't expect to put hundreds of hours into it just yet.			"

This is an Early Access Report. It therefore only comments on the game's state during the time the report was made and whether or not it is enjoyable/who it will appeal to. This EAR will be revised upon the game's full release.We Need to Go Deeper is a 2-4 person cooperative rogue-like game of balancing tasks--from combat to submarine repair--and managing power output. Journey to the bottom of the sea with a team of friends, randoms, or a mixture of the two.


YouTube™ Video: First Impression | We Need to Go Deeper [Early Access] 

			Views: 218		

			Fire ze missiles! NeedtoKnow goes deep with this first impression! We Need to Go Deeper is a 2-4-player cooperative submarine rogue-like set in a Verne-inspired undersea universe currently in Early...		

Price $9.99 Price will rise as more content is added.What It Offers Now**Update 3/19/2017: New Lava biome, vanity customizations for your character, and universal enemies that appear across all biomes with the sole purpose of ruining your dive.**Update 2/15/2017: You can now make private rooms, where previously any one could join your game.You can also chat with folks in the lobby. A hectic mix of combat, steering, and submarine management.You use WASD to move, E to interact, and the mouse to use whatever item is in your hand. Steering your submarine is inverted, so holding W will cause you to descend and S to ascend. It also controls like a brick, but what were you expecting of something that size?As you explore the open sea, your one destination is down. You’ll encounter various aquatic life, obstacles, and explorable caves that contain loot. The majority of the game is played aboard your submarine, so you will need to maintain the structural integrity of your hull, which is indicated at the top right of the screen. On your sub, there are four main areas:  a bed to heal, a helm to steer, the engine bay that controls where power is routed, and a place to fire the torpedos! The majority of combat is done aboard your sub. The engine room allows you to allocate a total of 4 points to:--light (for dark zones)--shields (to protect against enemies) --engine (to increase speed and maneuverability)--torpedos (up to three slots for subsequent shots) Allocating more than one point will make your shields stronger, allow you to maneuver faster, and allow you to load more torpedoes simultaneously respectively. Depending on how many people are in your crew, you’ll need to alternate between steering, mending the hull, fending off creatures that board you, and firing torpedos. Teamwork is the name of the game.Enemies attack in one of three ways: 1) by ramming into the sub, which create holes and cause leaking, 2) by boarding your sub and attacking your crew directly 3) by latching on to your craft. These must have all of their invading appendages cut off before they can be dealt with. Be careful to patch holes in your hull or else the sub will fill with water and you'll drown. The game is very good about auditory feedback; you’ll hear water filling some part of the ship, enemies that board, and the battle cries of specific oncoming enemies. Each sea creature takes a different number of torpedoes to kill. Larger enemies take 2 or 3 while smaller one take a single shot.Boss battles occur at the end of each biome zone and will be specific to each region. There are currently 2 regions that we know of. Ship problems and character sickness are biome specific. For example: in the ice biome, the doors will freeze and you can catch hypothermia by standing in icy water. As you descend, you will discover undersea caves which can be explored on foot. These are filled with monsters, gold, lootable corpses, and a submarine upgrade (1 per cave). If you die, you can be revived by a friend at the cost of having your HP permanently reduced for the remainder of the run. This means you can revived 5 times in total before truly dying. If the submarine's structural integrity reaches 0 health or your entire party dies simultaneously, it’s game over. After you've been given the game over screen, you are returned to the main menu where you can spend your gold to purchase outfits and items that you discover during your playthrough. These items are used as part of your loadout as when you start the game, you are able to choose one starting item. You can carry up to two at a time and swap between them at any time by right-clicking. Communication is key here, because if everybody starts with a weapon, you will have no one to repair your submarine.What It Promises10 biomes for the full release, each full of unique enemiesNumerous boss battles where each boss is suited for the biomeSeveral submarines  to choose from, including one's specialized for certain playstylesA discoverable undersea civilization, unique to each biome. This comes with a translator to help player understand the unique languagesLoads more equipmentAn endgame. You’ll be able to make it to the bottom--and then…?.Bottom line.This is a hectic cooperative experience and one that most anyone can enjoy with a bit of practice. In its current state, the game is 100% playable, enjoyable, and recommendable--and it will only get better from here.If this review/EAR helped you, please give it a thumbs-up.

Early Access Review
								PROS- 2-4 Players. Although some would say that the lack of a solo mods is bad, I wouldn't see it that way. You are forced to cooperate with someone. If you don't have a friend at hand, that means randoms, and can lead to interesting situations! It's a lot of fun to start talking on discord, and learn to cooperate as a team with a few random players. We got very far with just two people!- Procedurely generated. Whilst almost mandatory for a game like this, I think it's well done the way it is. The map can even hide valuable caves for you, and can force you to explore other ends of the map, instead of just going deeper.- Diversified threats. You rarely die in the same way, and the devs keep on adding. Of course you learn all about these different biomes, but for now it's quite refreshing.- A goofy, yet scary artstyle. You're like hey, these fishes don't look so scary, that one even looks cute! But when you go deeper, that is where the scary creatures come along o.o, I hadn't expected fish could even look scary with an artstyle like this, good job devs!- A dedicated dev team. Lots of response to the forums, and generally they work hard on improvements. I remember that after an update a few areas became a lot more challanging!- Customization is always fun.Cons- Some networking issues, a priority of the devs, will get fixed soon!- Potentially repetetive. Although this depends on the kind of gamer you are, you may find it repetive, especially if your crew never mixes up roles. This often happens in a crew of 3-4, try playing with just 2 for more challenge, diversity! It's a lot more intense!- Kit system. Rather underwhelming in its current state, you only ever want a wrench or a sword for starters, if you take almost anything else, you'll lack the ability to repair properly, or fight properly, which causes many issues.- There is no cuttlefish in the game.- Some bugs, but nothing major.REMEMBER: This game is early acces, a lot of the stuff will get updated, but for it's current state I would say it is very strong already!

Early Access Review
								Already a really great game, with the potential to be incredible. The best way I can describe it is a mixture of the gameplay of Guns of Icarus and the art style of something like Don't Starve. Over the last few days/week there have been countless 'Hot Fixes' from the devs that have addressed concerns and issues players have voiced. For an Early Access title this is suprisingly rare, and warrants both attention and praise.You and up to 3 other players help crew a submarine in an expedition to go as deep as possible under the sea. Different roles like steering, fixing the hull and firing torpedoes at the underwater beasties require teamwork and cooperation, so I will admit I can see it being frustrating for people who don't have friends to play it with, but thankfully it is simple enough that I think most people won't have a problem. The game isn't the most complex game yet, involving essentially only 3 or 4 different actions to progress, but a number of placeholders (for example, there are obvious markers that indicate future additions of more submarines and further character customisation and personalisation) within lead me to believe it will be a fair bit deeper. I have thoroughly enjoyed the few hours I have played so far.			"

								Beautiful art style, amazing soundtrack, We Need to go Deeper is a brilliant co'op experiance.  There are bugs, however the devs are seeming to solve them very quickly, which is nice to see for once in a smaller early access game.Without bringing friends, your experiance will be dampened slightly, however joining with randoms can still deliver a great experiance depending on how they play and interact with you and others.  In hindsight ai dont think I have came across a lobby with anyone i took a disliking to.Overall, We Need to go Deeper is a very  promising game and I feel that it is well worth a purchase. With the devs planing to add more content in the future It will definetly have a rather long lifetime.It would be better if they relesed the soundtrack already!			"

								Edit: Online is mostly fixed now so I'd definately pick it up now with friends. The game has a lot of potential but currently is buggy, online is glitchy and could use some more content and mecanics. That is, however, exactly what early access is for. The games has the potential to be a extremely fun co-op game for friends where everyone can pick up how to play but there still is depth. Hopefully after a few patches most of the bugs will be ironed out and then I'd advise people to pick it up.			"

								*Early-access review!* We Need To Go Deeper is being actively developed and bug-fixed! Although you may still encounter some problems and bugs, be sure to keep the devs informed! They've been doing good work with hotfixing the product.UPDATE: Reformed the review to fit the circumstances.--Short version: We Need To Go Deeper is a co-operative game about exploration and survival. Thanks to its' simple interface and fluid mechanics it should be an interesting addition to the legion of co-op games out there. 4/5.--Long version: We Need To Go Deeper is a co-operative game about exploration and survival. Albeit the game can be played solo, it is highly recommendable to either play with friends or join random lobbies available in the game's menus. The gameplay is about controlling a submarine mutually with a crew consisting of up to 4 people, whereas 2 seems to be recommended minimum. The co-operative gameplay supports *both* Internet- and LAN-connections, which is a huge bonus to this game's value! Hosting and joining lobbies is very easy and fluid, and the text-chat within the game allows players to co-ordinate their actions if microphones and external communication software are not readily available. The control mechanics themselves feature minimal keyboard usage and a mouse, no support for a controller as much as I could see -- cardinal directions, use-button, overview of the submarine's surroundings, use of equipped item and switching the equipment. The crew need to control basic things such as engine power, steering, weapons and hull-integrity while inside the submarine. Optimally one person should be always in charge of steering while the other handles engine and gunnery control. Obviously the more people, the easier the control will be.All in all, the biggest strength of the game is its' easy-to-approach style and intention to keep the gameplay fun. We Need To Go Deeper seems like a nice co-op game with a lot of potential, possibly keeping you entertained from several to even a couple of dozen hours. 4/5.			"

Early Access Review
								Update as of 25/02/16 - After 27.5 hours of this game i still play it nearly every day. This game is tons of fun with friends or with the right team of randoms. Constantly rewarding. I didn't think there was anything else to unlock until i got to 10k fathoms and to my suprise... A whole new selection of outfits! The devs are fantastic and very community involved. Take my word for it and don't pass on this game.To be honest im not one for jumping on a near full price game in early access. However... I just had to with this game. The beautiful graphics and the brilliant concept (not to mention non-gender specific moustaches and beards ;)) drew me in and i took a gamble with a friend. We went in and straight away were in fits of giggles:- Hillarious crouched walking animations will definately impress your friends (NEVER change this)- Wonderful ragdoll chicken leg animations when you jump leaving everyone in awe!- The community i have met so far are fun people aswell as team workers- Game developers are already fast at fixing things less than 24 hours in!- Clear path of what they want to do in the future- Constantly different adventures- Scream inducing and has you giddy like a school girl at timesCons:-I have honestly only found one con. This is a bug that causes a person to not be recognised as inside the sub so therefore renders you all unable to function any of the jobs. HOWEVER. This happened only twice and both were with the same random player so could have been something on his side i'm not sure.In short:-We took the gamble and i don't regret a penny. I think already i have a bargain on my hands as this game is already well fleshed out compared to most early access. Try it and you will be in for a great time full of laughs and toe curling moments when things suddenly go wrong! Keep up the fantastic work developers and don't stray from your path. Fantastic job.

Early Access Review
								WOW. ""We Need to Go Deeper"" is a truly fun game- be it managing the helm, firing and reloading torpedos, or even just sleeping on that comfortable bed. In ""We Need to Go Deeper"", you embark on a 20,000 Leagues-esque adventure to conquer the aquatic world below. You meet a variety of different ocean enemies, find new caves, and get gold. Using that gold, you shop in the catalog to buy absolutely fabulous clothing and hats. Also, the name is not in fact an innuendo to some sort of Huniepop style game, like I thought it was- in fact, it's a different genre entirely. However, it is pretty fun screaming ""WE NEED TO GO DEEPER"" to your friends over a Skype call.I have literally no complaints with this game- and I can't wait for new updates to come out. With this being released three days ago (at the time of this review) I think that this game is truly amazing. Go devs! I'm just warning you, but I am the one and only Capt' Nutsack. You can never claim that name. Glad we had this talk. "

								Great little 4 player crew game!Concept is simples, go... deeper...The deeper you go, the harder it gets and the more rewards you come across.Progression is done via coins and unlocks you obtain in your adventure in the deep.Each time you dive you loose any 'pickups' you find, but you can unlock things to purchase by.... going deeper.Unlocks range from vanity items through to items to help you when you start a new game.The art aesthetics of the game are great and the gameplay is super simple and enjoyable.This game is recommended if you:a) have at least 3 people you can team up with, with voice coms while playing without is doable, voice is always better.b) are happy to join/play with random people as there is no Singleplayer options. - Every game has♥♥♥♥♥♥♥:(c) do not expect a really deep and complex gameplay experience(it is not a simulator).It is a fun little game, with a simple concept that actually is really fun to play with a group but even alone can be fun.

Early Access Review
Note: This is an Early Access Comment and only applies to the current features. It may or may not be updated depending on when you read this.Overall, for an Early Access game, We Need to Go Deeper is awesome. It is not yet very complex, but as I state below, the devs are absolutely amazing and I have no doubt they will add many more features in the future. Please don't decide to not buy the game simply based off the reviews that talk about ridiculous server trouble, as they were outdated pretty much as soon as they were written. This game has a lot of potential and a great dev team, so I think we can expect an awesome game upon full release!ShoutoutFirst off, I don't think that I have ever seen so many updates pushed out in so little time, so I would like to mention that not enough people appreciate the devs for all the hard work they have done to get the servers into the shape that they are in. For example, around 4:45 (I don't remember the exact time) on February 12th, they sent out a message saying that they were attempting to fix a relay server problem, and in about 1.5 hours they had completely erased the issue. Great job, devs! Server StabilityJust a few days ago, it was very hard to join a server without the game crashing, and to be honest the game was just about unplayable. Now, they are much more stable; I don't think my friends and I have had any troubles joining games even though a few of them have the IPv6 problem. Also, the most recent update adding private servers was a much needed fix; people joining games was really annoying without lobby chat (another awesome addition).GameplayTo me, the gameplay is great. It doesn't get boring quickly at all. I think it would benefit from more random map generation and more extensive caves, as long as health is better balanced so that the crew doesn't have to run in, defeat three or four crabs, and run back to the sub to heal. Also, once more subs are released, I think the game will be much more fun.Misc.The only other complaint I have about the game is that it can only be played multiplayer co-op, but the purchase is for one copy. I think that a $15.00 - $17.50 two copy edition would be a great addition. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this game to just about anyone!			"

								it's an extremly fun game...once you can connect to a lobby. It will take a few tries, hopefully to be fixed soon, but it is worth the wait. There are numerous bugs here and there but that is to be expected, nothing that's a deal breaker. I can't wait for more.edit- the chat leaves a bit to be desired espesially for the pre-game lobby, which chat currently isn't opperational. It would be fantastic for stratagy talk. in the recent updates many of the connection issues were fixed, but it will still take a try or two in order to connect. This game has limitless potential			"

								First off lemme start by saying the Dev Team is a bunch of good hearted people. I just got done talking to Ryan on steam directly and he wanted to collect as much data from me as possible to resolve problems with an Early Access Game. This let me know they are actually driven for this game to work and kick off, and I beg everyone to throw the 10 dollars and give it a try. The actual game play is challenging, and the need to communicate with your crew is also very interesting as well! We need to go Deeper reminds me of Guns of Icarus - minus the multiplayer or PvP aspect. It is a PvE game that forces a group of 4 to maintain Hull Integrity in their Late 1800s or Early 1900s submarine (that is what the art reminds me of at least.) And as the title says, You need to Go Deeper. Definitely recommend, and if you do get it Early Access please please please give the Devs as much data as you can on bugs, they REALLY WANT to fix it.

								Review V1 (0.3 hours)I only had time to try it out for a bit this morning with another friend who bought it but it was pretty fun! I'll update the review when I've played more but for now I would definitely recommend it to everyone. Obviously it's missing some stuff since the game is in Early Access but there's more than enough content for you to keep playing for a while and not get bored immediately. It was kind of challenging with only the two of us but that also made it kind of more fun, changing the amount of people you play with is definitely another way to try out the game in different ways once you've played through it a lot and need something new.Review V2 (3.1 hours)Convinced another friend to buy it + gifted it to a 4th person and tried out some 4 player games. It's even more fun with 4 people although even with 4 it gets really difficult by the 3rd level (I've only gotten about 4900 fathoms deep). Now that I've played it some more there are some bugs/glitches I've noticed so I'm going to put it below so the devs can see it:1. My 2nd time playing it (3 people) when we entered the 2nd level/stage the game crashed for 2 people but the host stayed in the game and could play by himself.2. Both with 3 people and 4 people occasionally when someone picks up a item from the ground when they already have 2 equipped and then place it back down the others can't see it. So for example: you have sword and wrench, you grab cleaver from ground and put wrench down. Now you reequip the wrench and put the cleaver back down but the others can't see the cleaver or equp it, only you can. This only sometimes happened and other times it didn't.3. I'm not sure if this is a feature or a glitch but if you're in a cave and you shoot into the wall with a gun and there's a snail or something else down on the floor it takes a damage. This also happens at different angles where you can't be attacked but you can shoot with gun into wall.4. If the torpedoe slots are closed and you stand in front of it and spam e to place the torpedoe in, as soon as the slot opens you place the torpedoe in and then you still have a torpedoe in your hand so its like you got extra ammo in your hand without doing anything.5. If you create a game and name it something, then leave, and then make another lobby and name it the same thing it doesn't show up for anyone else. If you name it something else it works but if it's the same it doesn't. We had to restart the game 3 times before it let us use the same name.6. One of us bought the safari shirt but then it wasn't in customization and no longer in catalog, it just disappeared.However these are all minor glitches and the game is still a ton of fun, I'll update this as I play more.

								Incredibly fun, especially with friends on VOIP. At last, a good example of an early access project that is totally playable and enjoyable. You don't feel like you're paying for promises instead of a game. The only huge problem ATM is the lack of chat in a lobby. If no one takes the wrench as the first item it will be impossible to fix the submarine and therefore you're doomed from the beginning and gonna get bodied, and you are unable to communicate on that with random people. Besides that, it is as awesome as it gets, pure indie badassery.			"

								I bought this game thinking it wasn't going to be that fun and I was just going to refund it and get my money back. This wasn't the case. This is my first review and I'm making it for a reason. This game is awesome. It is so fun and it is one of the best games out there for the price. The only downside I've seen is that it is a bit hard to get into a game, but my first game lasted an hour, so it was worth it. Another isssue I see is that there needs to be more optimization for connecting. Half of the games are impossible to get into and when you get into a game, most of the time it is lagging and you have to leave. All in all, I recommend this game for anyone becuase of the price and how easy it is to run.			"

								  Tiene sus fallos, sí, bugs y prácticamente muchas de las opciones aún no están habilitadas pero... lo poco que llevo probando este juego me ha enamorado sinceramente.  Es un juego que es imposible jugar de forma solitaria y excepcional en multijugador (cuando la crew está completa y no se sufren caídas de servidor), muy divertido y complicado cuanto más te adentras en las profundidades del océano, mientras descubres tesoros que cada vez te irán dando mayores recompensas y descubriendo criaturas cada vez más desafiantes. Hay que añadirle algo de humor, que bien me ha hecho pasar buenas risas y momentos de desesperación.  Creo vale la pena dar su oportunidad, estoy muy ansiosa por ver cómo avanzarán y tienen mi apoyo y mis mejores deseos.			"

								Just discovered this in the murky depths, sunk a whole evening into this with 3 of my friends , what a laugh , what great fun. I'm looking forward to the development of this game there is obviously some great potential here with ""We Need to Go Deeper"". I would totally recommend this to anyone who loves co-op multiplayer. I'll be following this for a while and hopefully they do a four pack bundle because I would totally buy this again for my friends.I'd love to see an 8 player sub that would be fantastic, as I felt sorry for the rest of my group on chat when they heard how much fun we were having they were all checking out the game on the store page, but we all want to play together haha.The musical score is pretty decent as well and the sound effects are quite mood building , especially when the sub is creakin like das boot.Once again I return to the deep in search of fortune and glory!

It's so fresh, it's so much fun and from the minute we started playing we didn't stop laughing. This was a bolt out of the blue for me, wasn't expecting it to be so fun.

								This game is simply perfect for people looking for a real team-based experience in this nice little ship here! i'm not going to judge the game too harshly, and i will most likely overlook many flaws, but i will try my best to describe this game.Pros.-You can find nemo-Good team-based strategy-No mandatory tutorials-Many good times and laughs when playing with friends-Oh hey, there's blue fish that nobody cares about there too!-There are no lenny faces that appear on chat-HOLY CRAP THIS IS A NON-PIXELATED INDIE GAME-Bosses that are a threat-Suddenly, water-Then everyone died, the end-The first impressions are amazing-You somehow unlock items in the catalog by doing underwater stuff or something-The artstyle can make things cute, and scary, in fact you may be shaking your boots right now, looking at themUnsurities.-A mildly harder than usual learning curve-The art style here is something that not many people are used to, but is a breath of fresh airCons.-Lack of leaderboard(This will most likely change in the future)-Lack of a few features that usualy come standard with a releaseAnyways, i will update this guide in the future, but it doesn't mean i'm treating this game purely amazingly, it has some flaws and all, but its a good game, the devs may end up making a wonderful piece to steam, trying to repair the wound that someone has been caused by many other indie developers.

								Payed my 10 dollors for this game and i am not regreting it its mechanics in game are extremely fluid most of the time and even when they arent i understand that its early access and there still working on it the only real problem with the game is the lobby connection issues and the lobby loading timers between pages being a bit wonky but there working on it nonstop to fix those problems so all in all i would recomend this game for anyone who loves the ocean and the teamwork of a co-op game and it is well worth 10 dollors and when its realesed fully after its early access this game will go on for the next few generations and will probably become a classic to play on your off day truely marvelous but dont take my word for it look at the hundreds of other reviews to get rid of any chance of bias you will be suprized that there are not that many bad reviews that make sense and there ussaly bad because they cpmplain of bugs which the dev team are working on fixing ive said my piece Thank You and have a good dive.

								Scouring through steam for some semblance of a game that isnt a steaming pile of free2play garbage or trash shallow indie cashgrabs.Came across this thing, figured its worth a shot for 10 bucks.Im playing it with 2 friends, we are all stubborn persistant professionals. Great use of 1 hour on a saturday night trying to connect to each other to no avail. We tried everything. You simply cannot connect to your friends' game to play. I have no idea what the game itself is like, as we couldnt play. Keep the 10$ devs, you obviously need to buy a copy of networking for dummies.			"

								I think we need to go deeper is a good game if you injoy team based games or micro management games like FTL but it is early access which makes it hard to recommend as there are many gameplay glitches and sometimes i couldn't even join or create a game .There are many missing features like different subs and the ability to change maps, also, the enemies while cool at first get very repeatetive and can be easily killed if you have any knowlage of the game. In the end i think this game has potential but right now i dont think it is worth the $9.99			"

								Every time the game updates, I expect to see more bugfixes, but so far it's only added content. I would love to play this game and have a ton of fun with my crew, but each time we play someone ends up disconnecting to the server and we have to quit. If this would get fixed, the game would atleast be playable (even though still buggy), and I would be able to then enjoy the new content.Can't wait for this to get fixed, though, because I really do like this game.

After each crash (automatic restart or manually) the game doesnt want to connect to anything exept LAN anymore for about 10 minutes. I cannot say anything positive about the game exept that it has a nice art style. Not recommended at this time			"

								The first thing you'll see in this game is a buggy menu that can't keep up with your mouse, buttons of different sizes because there is less text in some of them and some features that aren't finished that still need buttons.Menu's don't block you from clicking on buttons and might break the game in some cases. The animations are♥♥♥♥♥♥ you don't even have a climbing animation. The game has two seperate builds, one for the actual ""game"" and one for restarting the game when you crash, they're both equal in size. The restart build will kick in when you leave your server because your friend can't join, because if you have done that you've CRASHED. I have tried to host and join on my desktop, my laptop and my friends have too. Even with numerous re-installations.The 90 minutes or so that I have played this game I have tried to join my friend, I tried it at three different places on 2 different computers but they all have the same issue, which is not being able to join them, quite a large flaw for a game you'll have to play with at least TWO players.0/∞ would uninstall again.

Devs are also brilliant, thanks for using my screenshot!			"

								This game sucked me and my friend group into it. We found ourselves a few hours late, and over 10k meters deep after what only seemed like a half hour. We spent a great deal of time filling holes, shooting giant fish, and scavenging undersea caves!Highly recommendSome gameplay of the game with boss fights:

								For an early access game it's pretty good! It has so much potential and I can see it becoming something grander! This game is the art style of Don't Starve, 2D gameplay, and underwater exploration all in one. You have to maintain yourself and the submarine like a survival game. The only goal is to go deeper and you just do that as you go while finding caves with items and such, along with some unfriendly creatures on the way.			"

								This game is perfect for an early access game, though it could use some survival elements, such as the submarine being attacked in undersea caves so you can't leave it unattended for long, and possibly a creative element, like a submarine creator so everyone has a unique submarine design with pros and cons like size, and lengh, or, weapons, and power, the ammount of power cells it can have would be determined by size, if it's small it's the default four if it's medium, size add one cell, large size, add two, colossal size, add three, and expand room sizes, so players can select how many people can join the room, for larger crews in bigger subs but make them select a submarine first so it determines room max room size through two catagories, one. Size of the sub, two. Complexity of the sub, and if it's not to much trouble at a pvp mode, thats all I have to say, other than it's perfect for it's current version.			"

My only issues with it are that joining servers can be difficult, my game crashes when two people try to connect to the same server at once, and that finding an 'alternate IP source' or something like that takes a while.Other than that I adore this game!I also hope that the dev's release the soundtrack seperatly too!

								Cool little game, still very early access, game has MANY bugs. For example joining a server can take 10-100 attempts. The game can decide you can no longer drive your submarine when you come back from a cave... This game has a lot of promise and hopefully it will deliver. I recommend it if you don't mind a buggy game that will find a way to kick you in the butt every time you dive deeper.			"

								I'll get straight to the point and say that We Need to Go Deeper has a ton of potential to be a game that could easily become a cult hit. The art style is charming and the basic gameplay elements are solid. I'll go ahead and list of what works thus far:Pros+Great and endearing art style.+Fun and sometimes chaotic/intense co-op+A sense of teamwork and everyone serving an important purpose.+Reasonable priceCons-Networking issues  -Shoddy interface, pop-window warning about IP wouldn't go away until I clicked something in background.-Confusing and too simplistic combat-Lack of voice chatI understand the game is early access and so far it seems the developers have tried to remedy the issues with connections, but seeing as how the game is co-op only, the issues stand out way more. The combat on foot is functional, but the lack of knowing what the damage output is without numbers or a health bar is confusing. Also, maybe a charging attack by holding down the attack button would give it a bit more oomph and depth. The game also is lacking in content, but that's a given considering it's early access and I don't hold it against the game. It's great fun and I am looking very much forward to where it goes. I feel that once these issues get addressed, it could end up being my go-to co-op game with friends. I also suggest you get on skype/discord/whatever program you use for communcation as the game's in-chat leaves a lot to be desired.			"

YouTube™ Video: Indie Game Review: We Need to Go Deeper | Rogue-like Adventure | Great Indie Games on Steam 

			Views: 104		

			We Need to Go Deeper is a 2-4-player cooperative submarine rogue-like set in a Verne-inspired undersea universe. In the game, you and your crew must embark on many voyages into a mysterious undersea...		

IntroductionGet ready to set sail and dive deep into the depths of the ocean, to explore and plunder whatever treasures we may find. But be weary sailor, the ocean is unforgiving and many sea creatures lurk in the dark depths. How deep will you go? Will you survive? Come aboard if you’re with us, the Captain just gave his orders, “We Need, to Go Deeper.”StorylineThomas from WeiseGamer.com here with We Need to Go Deeper, an Early Access Title from Deli Interactive that came out February 8th of this year. You can pick it up for $9.99 on Steam from the link in the description.You are a member of a submarine crew of four, traveling down into the depths of the ocean to explore, plunder, and find whatever you can to aid your journey. The deeper you descend, the more dangerous it becomes, but the rewards are even greater. See how far you and your crew can go before you all die due to the monsters of the ocean.GameplayWe Need to Go Deeper is a rogue-like co-op game with two to four players. Really, if you don’t have at least three, you are going to struggle in this game and I’ll get into the details of the gameplay so you can see why.You start each game at the top of the ocean, diving down into the first generated biome. These biomes are randomly generated each time you start a trip, and contain caves to explore, fish and sea creatures to combat, and sometimes various obstacles and such too you’ll need to avoid.The sub has four positions on it. A captain that steers and pilots the vessel, an engineer that controls the power distribution to the sub, a magazine area containing torpedoes to load, and the turret position to fire the torpedoes and defend the ship.Technically, you can play with just two people, one captain and one loading/shooting. But this is not going to bode well for you over time as the time to load, jump back into the turret, and repeat takes quite a while. Plus, as you are attacked by various monsters in the sea, your hull takes damaged and needs to be repaired. Too much damage and your sub will start leaking, causing you to begin drowning. You can repair the holes by beating them with a wrench or other tool that does repairing that you have found along your journey.For me, the best experience with playing with a full group of 3 other friends so we all took turns on stations and were able to make it REALLY deep into the game.To wrap up gameplay, this is a rogue-like, so every time you die you keep any coins you collected. You can use these to purchase items from the catalog which include cosmetic character attire and tools, weapons, and items that you have found in previous journeys. Once purchased, you can start with these items instead of the basic wrench you begin with, so it can give you a better start and help you in the future runs. At the bottom of each biome is a boss you have to kill, then you can move into the next area/biome and start again. The deeper you go, the better the rewards, but the more dangerous and difficult the game becomes.VisualsVisually, this game has a really fun art style. The animations are in a puppet-like form, and look hilarious. I personally loved the art style, and even though the game is in early access and has a lot of place holder things that may change, they are off to a fantastic start with a cohesive theme throughout the game.AudioThe audio in this game is pretty good as well. There’s a neat effect when you are in the sub where sounds on the inside of the sub sound a bit different than when you are viewing the outside. The sound effects are fairly basic right now, but they may improve in the future as this is an early access title. Otherwise, there’s not too much to talk about here in a positive or negative light, the menu theme is great and I liked the soundtrack overall.Replay-abilityReplay ability is where this game absolutely shines. Provided you can find a crew of friends to play with regularly, this has all the tropes of a typical rogue-like. You can set off on as many voyages as you like, with loads of unlockable content in the current game to keep you coming back for more, trying to plunge deeper and deeper. I had so much fun playing with some friends on stream, we didn’t realize we were passing hours and staying up later than expected just enjoying the content. The game is in early-access now, and there’s a lot more content coming such as other submarine variants, bosses, items, outfits, and so much more.Overall Wrap-UpOverall, this game is $9.99 and worth every penny, provided you have a crew to play with. If you don’t have friends to play with, I would stay away from this. The player base isn’t big enough yet to be able to play with random people reliably, so you really need to have some friends to hop on with you into a lobby. I can’t wait to see where this game goes though and I know I’ll continue to play it as long as my friends are willing to go deeper with me.			"

								Let's the the bad out of the way: There's some pretty severe networking issues that can make getting a game together very very difficult and frustrating. Luckily this is alleviated by an incredibly communicative and responsive development team, who I'm sure will have those hiccups ironed out in no time.But once you DO get lobby together, and start the dive with you friends around you, you're in for a challenging, chaotic ride of fun. The idea works really well, and while the difficulty sort of jumps from not-very-hard-at-all to holy-****-what-the-****, we kept wanting to go back and start over when our adventure finally ended in a madness of squids, seaweed, and fish I don't dare guess the names of consuming our boat.I'm a huge fan of how little your overall progress moves with each game, the biggest thing being giving you some gold to pimp your hipster seafarer up with cosmetically. I do like looking fancily silly as i shout at my friend over the internet to not ****ing abbandon his post, while I'm trying to cut off the arm of a squid which just penetrated our engineroom.Fair warning, you CAN play as two, but you probably won't be able to get very far. Maybe the game should give you like an extra bar of electricity or something for when you're two, because once you pass into the darkness, you're pretty much done for. 3 works super well.			"

								This game is a beautifully simple yet addictive concept with a hilariously goofy and entertaining art style. It can feel a little repetitive, but you just mix up your roles and yell at your friends and it's a great time for everyone.It's [understandably] super buggy right now (e.g. my screen showed the whole lower half of the sub submerged and I was drowning while everyone else in game saw and experienced no such thing) but that's just part of early access. Once they iron out the kinks, this game will be wonderful.Buy it! Support them! Help find the kinks so that all may one day enjoy the Unterseeboten Misadventures of Winterbottom and Friends.			"

								This is an unbelievable concept.  Me and three buddies launched this game while sitting in the same room as eachother and played for an hour.  We were intently working to get our submarine to immense depths and fight undersea monsters. During the battle below we were screaming at eachother, running support for eachother, raiding caves and so much more.  I cannot wait to see this game evolve into something more complete, however, I must admit it's a ton of fun in its infancy.			"

								The idea is there and so is the fun!  but a major flaw is the fact that this is a COOP game at its core!  It is really hard to try and solo this game.  you will die fast!    and this is where the flaw comes to play.  as the the online portion of this game seems to not work at all (at least for me) Pros:The concept itself is cool, and seems fun with what little I have played with it.Simple to play and easy to understandControls well no major issues with gameplayCons: online and lan games seem to have issues. (have not been succesfull in joining a single online game) and with my freinds and LAN we have had issues with some if not all of us discconecting			"

								Out the gate, this game is a pretty fun game to mess around with friends. The description says 2-4 players, but so far the sweet spot of players that we've hit is 3. If anything, this isn't a game to play super seriously but a game where you and your friends share a common goal and try to have fun getting there. You can't save in between journeys so every journey is a new beginning.This game is about you and up to 3 friends manning a submarine trying to get to the bottom of an undersea trench. The trench has different zones (we've only made it to two zones so far) with a boss between zones. Within each zone is an undersea cave where you can get an upgrade for your ship and some gear for your characters, such as weapons and tools. I don't usually pick up nor recommend early access games, but this game I would recommend IF you are optimistic in the developers living up to the promises or aren't too picky. Menus are filled with planned features and of course the game is a little rough around the edges right now Buying it on sale for $8, though, my friends already got good laughs out of it.			"

								For an early access game it's pretty good! It has so much potential and I can see it becoming something grander! This game is the art style of Don't Starve, 2D gameplay, and underwater exploration all in one. You have to maintain yourself and the submarine like a survival game. The only goal is to go deeper and you just do that as you go while finding caves with items and such, along with some unfriendly creatures on the way.			"

Early Access Review
								Short version: Some connection issues, but if it works it's a LOT of fun! 30 second summary of the game: https://clips.twitch.tv/lietu/FancyChickenRuleFiveLong version:Got this on day 1 of Early Access, and completely without testing or preparation fired it up with a couple of guys from around the planet.The online lobby system is a bit problematic, sometimes the game takes a full minute to be able to connect, complaining about online components initializing or similar. Only one of the 3 of us was able to successfully host a game so the other 2 were able to join it - I tried to host and someone outside of our group was able to join, but neither of the other 2 players I was playing with could join. I could not join any server unless I had a VPN on, with the VPN on the component initialization issue wasn't there, but I couldn't join anything. Quite odd, would love to get more information on how to make this work better, by doing port forwarding or similar. The latency and other issues that the VPN likely caused apparently made the game lose sync of the status of things, and broke our ability to navigate the ship completely a few times. You cannot simply invite the friends you want to the game, and you cannot kick off players from the lobby, or set a password.However, once you get the game running it's a LOT of fun. We had a party of 3 guys on Discord voice chat, and it was a constant stream of ""oh no a shark!"", ""cut the engines"", ""leak in navigation"", ""WHAT IS THAT?!"". Lots of very fun hectic moments with everyone running around the sub trying to fight off the monsters attacking the sub and fixing leaks, while trying to balance power distribution and keep torpedo tubes loaded.While it's rogue-like, there is some permanent progress in the game. You collect gold in caves, and you can use that to unlock certain kinds of apparel and tools.The game feels great for an Early Access -title on first day, the only problems we really had was with the lobby system and connections in general, and I can see this game being absolutely amazing fun in the future as they make the online connectivity better.Our longest run lasted a little under 30 minutes and the time simply flew by. Everyone had a great time, and was constantly busy, and we had a feeling that we were progressing even when we encountered issues like when we couldn't navigate the sub due to some bug.So, while the game has some network issues the game is still a lot of fun to play. Another thing worth noting is that it looks like the game will be very hard to play with only 2 people, with 3 people it was really hard and only with 4 did it seem like we had enough time to manage status quo, but when things got hairy we still had a hard time keeping up with things.For a full video of our ~30min run that shows how hectic it can be check out https://www.twitch.tv/videos/120656126 "

YouTube™ Video: Indie Game Review: We Need to Go Deeper | Rogue-like Adventure | Great Indie Games on Steam 

			Views: 104		

			We Need to Go Deeper is a 2-4-player cooperative submarine rogue-like set in a Verne-inspired undersea universe. In the game, you and your crew must embark on many voyages into a mysterious undersea...		

IntroductionGet ready to set sail and dive deep into the depths of the ocean, to explore and plunder whatever treasures we may find. But be weary sailor, the ocean is unforgiving and many sea creatures lurk in the dark depths. How deep will you go? Will you survive? Come aboard if you’re with us, the Captain just gave his orders, “We Need, to Go Deeper.”StorylineThomas from WeiseGamer.com here with We Need to Go Deeper, an Early Access Title from Deli Interactive that came out February 8th of this year. You can pick it up for $9.99 on Steam from the link in the description.You are a member of a submarine crew of four, traveling down into the depths of the ocean to explore, plunder, and find whatever you can to aid your journey. The deeper you descend, the more dangerous it becomes, but the rewards are even greater. See how far you and your crew can go before you all die due to the monsters of the ocean.GameplayWe Need to Go Deeper is a rogue-like co-op game with two to four players. Really, if you don’t have at least three, you are going to struggle in this game and I’ll get into the details of the gameplay so you can see why.You start each game at the top of the ocean, diving down into the first generated biome. These biomes are randomly generated each time you start a trip, and contain caves to explore, fish and sea creatures to combat, and sometimes various obstacles and such too you’ll need to avoid.The sub has four positions on it. A captain that steers and pilots the vessel, an engineer that controls the power distribution to the sub, a magazine area containing torpedoes to load, and the turret position to fire the torpedoes and defend the ship.Technically, you can play with just two people, one captain and one loading/shooting. But this is not going to bode well for you over time as the time to load, jump back into the turret, and repeat takes quite a while. Plus, as you are attacked by various monsters in the sea, your hull takes damaged and needs to be repaired. Too much damage and your sub will start leaking, causing you to begin drowning. You can repair the holes by beating them with a wrench or other tool that does repairing that you have found along your journey.For me, the best experience with playing with a full group of 3 other friends so we all took turns on stations and were able to make it REALLY deep into the game.To wrap up gameplay, this is a rogue-like, so every time you die you keep any coins you collected. You can use these to purchase items from the catalog which include cosmetic character attire and tools, weapons, and items that you have found in previous journeys. Once purchased, you can start with these items instead of the basic wrench you begin with, so it can give you a better start and help you in the future runs. At the bottom of each biome is a boss you have to kill, then you can move into the next area/biome and start again. The deeper you go, the better the rewards, but the more dangerous and difficult the game becomes.VisualsVisually, this game has a really fun art style. The animations are in a puppet-like form, and look hilarious. I personally loved the art style, and even though the game is in early access and has a lot of place holder things that may change, they are off to a fantastic start with a cohesive theme throughout the game.AudioThe audio in this game is pretty good as well. There’s a neat effect when you are in the sub where sounds on the inside of the sub sound a bit different than when you are viewing the outside. The sound effects are fairly basic right now, but they may improve in the future as this is an early access title. Otherwise, there’s not too much to talk about here in a positive or negative light, the menu theme is great and I liked the soundtrack overall.Replay-abilityReplay ability is where this game absolutely shines. Provided you can find a crew of friends to play with regularly, this has all the tropes of a typical rogue-like. You can set off on as many voyages as you like, with loads of unlockable content in the current game to keep you coming back for more, trying to plunge deeper and deeper. I had so much fun playing with some friends on stream, we didn’t realize we were passing hours and staying up later than expected just enjoying the content. The game is in early-access now, and there’s a lot more content coming such as other submarine variants, bosses, items, outfits, and so much more.Overall Wrap-UpOverall, this game is $9.99 and worth every penny, provided you have a crew to play with. If you don’t have friends to play with, I would stay away from this. The player base isn’t big enough yet to be able to play with random people reliably, so you really need to have some friends to hop on with you into a lobby. I can’t wait to see where this game goes though and I know I’ll continue to play it as long as my friends are willing to go deeper with me.			"

								This is a very nice and aesthetically pleasing game to play, when it works.  I have great respect for the developers to have spent all this time creating a game as intricate and detailed as this.  My only issues with it are that joining servers can be difficult, my game crashes when two people try to connect to the same server at once, and that finding an 'alternate IP source' or something like that takes a while.Other than that I adore this game!I also hope that the dev's release the soundtrack seperatly too!

								love this game! It's even better when you have 3 friends to play with. There are some bugs but thats version 0.5.0 so I can understand that. It would be nice though if there was a mode to play alone.Never had problems with servers. unless you use a cracked version...			"

								Great and fun game but I cannot switch to better resolution , i am stuck on low resolution because every time I open the game it doesn't open the little box where you can choose the graphics and resolution.			"
