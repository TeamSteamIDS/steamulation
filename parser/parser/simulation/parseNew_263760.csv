												So happy this game is finally released on Steam! I adored the first one ""Stair dismount"" and this one is even better than the first one being with cars! I do love fast cars and all that, and this game is perfect for having fun and laughing when you see all the accidents. You can also costumize your character being able to place a face of someone you hate and you can also add any car logo you want, like i chose Bugatti :D. Love this game and i'm looking forward to new updates! Have fun playing it yourselves!			"

												+ Lots of fun crashing into objects+ Multiple vehicles with different physics+ Customization options+ Replay value+/- No campaign or story, it's just a bunch of levels (not really needed but still a point I wanted to address)- No goals/objectives, just high scores- You can't put objects anywhere you want, but only on specific spots- Limited number of levels[Rating: 76/100]			"

												What does Turbo Dismount have to offer as a game? Spills, thrills, and mega destruction! This is one of those games that you can pick up very easily and its simple, mindless fun. There is no goal to Turbo Dismount, you kinda just set up a level and watch the carnage. With many customizable options, you can choose how Mr.Dismount explodes or gets beheaded... IN STYLE! If you have a very specific kind of humor and wouldn't find a lifeless body being torn apart and vehicles being ripped apart entertaining (there is no blood in this game as a side note), then this game isn't for you. If you are thinking about buying it and it looks like your cup of tea, go for it! If your looking for a story or an adventure, look elsewhere, because this is the epitome of stupid fun!			"

												Ah, Tubo Dismount.  The name alone conjures up images of, well, your mom, actually, but this is not the time or the place for that particular tale.Anyway, Turbo Dismount is the heartbreaking story of Joe Dismount.  A man trapped in a world that seems to want nothing more than to push him down each time he tries to rise, and hobble him every time he tries to walk.  It's a familiar scene, the cycle of repression which seems torn straight from today's geopolitical headlines.As painful as it is to watch Joe's agonizing struggles, and I must admit it brought a tear to my eye more than once, we have to face the fact that Joe is not entirely a blameless victim here.  Joe appears to be actively seeking his own demise, and every time we see him dangling from the back of a speeding sports car, or rolling off of a cliff in an office chair, we can only wonder what horrors Joe has seen, or dare I say, even participated in, that drive this insatiable lust for the sweet release of death.We may never know, for as simple as Turbo Dismount may appear on the surface, beneath lies a complex web of tortured emotion and dark secrets best left undisturbed.  Some may view Joe as a hero, others may see him as a villan, but where Turbo Dismount succeeds in uniting us, is that we can all see Joe torn into little pieces strewn across a highway in the middle of a twenty vehicle pileup.  I suppose that in the end, that's all that really matters.			"

												Watching a ragdoll with Kanye West's head ride on a motorbike into a pile of bricks is probably the most fun I will ever have in a video game. I've nearly played a whole day of just sending these men in monster trucks into high-speed traffic, and then observing their limbs torn away from their body in slow motion. This is Turbo Dismount.Turbo Dismount is one of these few arcade games that I don't get bored with after about an hour or so. Normally I would play this game for a bit, but then get tired of seeing the same thing over and over. But the vast variety in Turbo Dismount is hands down the best thing about this $10 gem.Customization in Turbo Dismount is everywhere. You could paste your logo onto the front of a sports car, while Mr. Dismount clings on to the spoiler for dear life as he is shot up ramp leading to space, or make him lie down on a skateboard and push him off a cliff. There are around twenty vehicles in the game, but this number will grow with frequent updates. These vehicles include the super fast ""Wedge"", to the strange shopping cart, the ""Mall Racer"". All of which have unique speed and maneuverability.Levels in Turbo Dismount are what make the game shine. The sheer amount of variation with obstacles and level design is what sets Turbo Dismount apart. One of my personal favourites, ""Freeway"" has you atop a broken bridge, where poor Mr. Dismount is flung off and plummets onto a busy freeway, meeting his demise below a wreckage of cars. One other amazing thing about Turbo Dismount is the replay system. This allows you to pause, reverse or fast-forward your current dismount. You are able to see what caused the crash, viewing it at up to 1/16x slower or 4x faster.Another huge plus is the Steam Workshop. Using Unity, a video game development program, and the free Turbo Dismount package, you can create levels for Turbo Dismount and upload them to Steam. I myself have sometimes made strange and crazy paths of destruction, using Turbo Pads and traffic to my advantage. There is also optional Controller Support, which I found quite confusing while using my Xbox One controller.Overall Turbo Dismount is definitely worth the money, and with ample achievements, customization and leaderboards, there is enough content to keep you playing for a lot longer that you though you might have. Turbo Dismount is definitely one of those must-have games, and one that won't be leaving my Installed list any time soon.9.8/10			"

												I absolutely love this game. At first your there like, ""there is hardly any levels, what is the point of playing this game if there ike downloading some more maps."" You go to the amazing steam workshop and doownload some maps. Then you try em out for about three or more hours. You're there like,"" I like these maps I am going to download some more maps."" then you download like fifteen more maps, and after about ten more hours of playing and steam workshop, you have like over one hundred fifty-three maps and you are extremely addicted to the game and can't stop playing. That's basically my perspective of this awesome game, I hope you like it as well.			"

												A very fun dismount game. All you need to do is to kill Mr Dismount and others then getting high scores like around 10 to 30,000,000 and more. The workshop levels are great also, with famous players like Markiplier, Jacksepticeye playing with those. Some workshop levels are very funny when like a mystery boost pad where you explode into pieces. Even some levels can help get you achievements also. Its my first ever crash game on Steam. If you love crashin', you better buy this game!			"

												I had never heard of this game in my life until I saw someone on Youtube playing it.   Then I saw it on steam, then it ended up in my possession.Turbo Dismount is a simple physics sandbox in where your character clings in humorous and non-safe ways onto vehicals and ploughs into traffic.  Really simple.  The crashes and the ammount of damage is a wonder to behold as you see Mr. (Or Mrs.) Dismount roll under cars and loose limbs and break bones.  The Game also has a replay function where you can slow, rewind and fast foward time so you can see that perfect bone crunching angle.  Also you can dot your path to traffic with Turbo Pads, or Speed Bumps, or Half-pipes or mines for the extra 'umph'.Levels are rather small but they do their job, and you have quite a selection of vehicals and poses, and when you are bored of what the developers made there is a host of steam workshop levels for you to play with aswell.And one level of praise I will give the developers, is customization, you can plaster your face, or someone you like (Or really hate) to the puppet Mr (Or Mrs.) Dismount, and you can attach a logo to your vehicals aswell.It's simple, it's fun, it's cheap, you should own this.

												Turbo Dismount is a game where the little guy falls out of the car and then the car runs him over. Turbo Dismount is where the little guy pedals his tricycle off of a cliff and down five stories onto landmines which launch him up into the air. Turbo Dismount is where the little guy does a loop-de-loop on a section of road and drives straight into a patch of landmines at top speed, making him and his car explode rather spectacularly. Turbo Dismount is where a guy gets into a drag race and finishes it by plowing his car into a wall.I could tell you about a hundred of these stories, but it's basically a guy, a car, and a set of circumstances in which you have to figure out how to inflict maximum pain on the guy, and the punchline involves grevious bodily harm.It's a joke you can re-experience and re-tool over and over, but the punchline itself starts to get stale around four hours after you've played out all the variations of ""What happens when an (adjective) (character) in a (type of car) drives into a (insert hazard here)?"". It's a bit like Mad Libs, but with physics and objects.I don't see myself playing this again anytime soon, but the time I did spend with it was hilarious, and there's a level based off of the Springfield Gorge scene from an early Simpsons episode called ""Bart The Daredevil"". So there's your recommendation.			"

												I have played the prequel to this game. Stair Dismount for mobile devices. It was one of the best time-wasters I had ever played, and Turbo Dismount, the sequel that I never even fathomed would be made, is even better than the prequel. You have a selection of quite a few different vehicles, from a monster truck to a skateboard to a red Angry Bird to a fire truck and everything in between. You also have different poses to choose from specific to each vehicle. You choose the map, speed, and GET ♥♥♥♥ING WRECKED by whatever you run into. It could be traffic, a brick wall, landmines, or scenery. It's so fun to see your little dude get mauled by everything in sight. That sounds messed up and quite gruesome, but there is no blood or gore in the game, however, there IS dismemberment, and I'm pretty sure that someone in the future will find a way to make a bloody mod for the game. The physics are well-done in some parts and downright hilarious in others, like when you run into traffic, and then there's a pileup and cars go flying everywhere. If there is one questionable thing I have to say about physics, it's how the guy, if he gets flung into the air, he will slowly stop spinning while in the air. This defies physics and just bugs me a bit for some reason I don't understand. There are also modded levels you can make for the game, which gives the fans something to do to contribute to the game. All in all, this is a time-waster worth the money. It's fun and hilarious and the modding community is very creative. Final Score: 8.75/10.			"

												I first played the Dismount series on mobile years ago and it became one of my favorite time killers to watch these poor rag dolls fall and tumble to their demise. It was one of the few games that I actually wanted to buy the expansion packs for, which added immense enjoyment with the expanded options. When I saw Turbo Dismount on sale on Steam, I knew that It would be hours of stupid amusement. The real fun came when I was hanging out with friends and we had nothing to do and the idea just came to me - ""What would I do if I was bored and didn't know what to do?"" The Answer: Play a mobile game and watch ragdoll physics. So I put my laptop up on the big screen and hours of stupid, fun, enjoyment commenced as we tested new ways to ruin Mr. Dismount's day.			"

Very youtubey game (5NaF, anyone?) but its pretty fun if you like causing carnage.So, it isn't meant to be a very serious game, that’s get that out of the way. If you like watching things explode in a cartoony fashion, this game is for you. Reminiscent of classical flash games, it is very much a game that unless you're making videos with it, it won't take you too long to get bored, that being said, it is a fun game to mess around with until you do.

								 Turbo Dismount is a kinetic tragedy about Mr. Dismount and the cars who love him. It is the official sequel to the wildly popular and immensely successful personal impact simulator - Stair Dismount.The highlights of this experience are multiple vehicles, an awesome replay system, (some) level editing features, high-speed physics and an indiscriminate sense of style. So buy it!			"

												I'm sure that many of those interested in buying this game were convinced to do so after watching a number of YouTube personalities♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves laughing. I was the same way at one point. Take my advice: just watch those videos some more. They're way more fun than the actual game.The objective of Turbo Dismount is to orchestrate vehicular accidents that cause as much damage as possible to your vehicle and the hapless mannequin forced into this dilemma. You have at your disposal various maps, vehicles, obstacles to litter the course with, and poses for your mannequin. If you've seen any of the aforementioned YouTube videos, you're no doubt aware of the sort of destruction that can ensue. This would be all fine and dandy if it actually felt like the player had any real control over the outcomes of these crashes.Accelerating the vehicle consists of holding down a button and releasing it at the moment when a meter is at the desired level. Because of how obscenely quickly the meter fills up and then empties again, precise timing is nearly impossible. This is compunded by the vehicles' tendency to do whatever they want to, such as letting up on the gas when you want them to speed up, vice versa. Many of the obstacles frequently fail to produce an intended effect, and sometimes fail to produce any effect at all. Even in levels that involve other traffic, those other vehicles appear in random order and speed by so quickly that it's nigh impossible to properly time a collision.The physics engine is capable, but unpredictable. A satisfying crash can have vehicle and body parts being strewn about and colliding with each other in amusing ways, but these moments are scarce thanks to the physics' refusal to behave consistently. It's also frustrating how your ragdolling mannequin often struggles to maintain its pose, or even stay attached to the vehicle, in order to have it hit something in a desired manner.All of these frustrations combine to form an experience that is usually comprised of restarting a level over and over and over again to get a desired result. When a beautiful catastrophe does happen, it tends to feel less like the results of the player's planning and effort, and more like the result of unintentional happenstance. Even if the player learns the mechanics and nuances well enough to consistently create satisfying crashes, what's left at that point is just a shallow, one-note time waster. Ragdoll crashes car. Ragdoll goes ragdolling. Oh, how the lolz are killing me.Turbo Dismount is a one-trick pony that ♥♥♥♥s up its one trick nine times out of ten. It may be worth getting if you have some easily amused eight-year-old children in your home who are in need of a distraction. Maybe you're into the sort of boring Sunday afternoon that's reminiscent of tossing about Legos in a feeble effort to create imaginary explosions. Otherwise, don't bother.			"

												The premise of this game is kinda dumb and I wasn't so sure about it. However, it became side-splitting fun very quickly.  Say what you will about any game but if it can literally make me laugh out loud them I'm going to like it. Games like Deadpool, for example, have this same quality.  Basically what you're doing is setting up one of your two customizable characters in a sandbox track type environment for various ways to do serious bodily harm to them.  Its basically like when you were a little kid and would set up a toy soldier on a little obstacle course with cars, explosions, and all of that sort of thing except it is virtual and freeking hilarious.  I've also heard this called a crash test dummy sim and I suppose that is fair too.  All I know is I think other people with a childish sense of humor like mine who like games will probably enjoy Turbo Dismount.  The gamer chooses a course, sets up some obstacles, picks a mode of transportation (cars, bikes, skateboard, etc) a customizable Mr or Ms Dismount character, and the position on the vehicle for the character, then sends them on the way to certain death.  Once the dismount is achieved the whole scenario can be rewound and played back at various speeds to your liking either for your own entertainment or to help decide how to tweak the course.  Everything in the game seems well done.  I haven't encountered anything to complain about.  The graphics are simple but highly adequate and the camera system is great.  If I had to complain about any one thing is that I'd like to see more obstacles and perhaps a user picked starting point.  Its not a big deal and perhaps is something left for the next version.  I'm not much of a multi-player type of person for the most part but I can see where this would be fun to play with someone else.			"

												One of the best stress relievers on Steam.Turbo Dismount is the game you unleash your pent up anger caused by other games (or life) via physics, ragdolls and high speed collisions. It offers a variety of maps, vehicles, character customizations and level customizations as well as several achievements to smash into along the way. The workshop is alive and added to regularly with several well-made and/or funny user created levels for additional gameplay content.  There’s something about those breaking bones and limbs being severed that brings a simile to ones face... Overall, it’s a definite recommendation for physics lovers or those who want a good laugh.

												I'll be honest, this game doesn't really have much of a point, there's not really an objective other than getting as brutally damaged as possible, but that is pretty much it.There are some modded levels that are start-to-end style, but they don't give you that sense of accomplishment.Give this game a try, but it's not a very satisfactory game.

Early Access Review
								This game is smaller than Stair Dismount but costs more money. If it comes out with free or really cheap DLC, you should probably only buy it if it goes on sale, like I did. But, for the levels, vehicles, and characters they have along with the free ones you can download or make yourself, it's not a bad game. I played through each level many times before getting bored just to come back in a week and do it again to try and top my own scores. So what if it seems narcistic to torture, maime and kill a dude to see how high of a score you can get by doing so. Let's all agree it's just fun to see a crash test dummy bite that dust. I give this game a 8/10 for lack of plot, lack of levels, and its price. Not too bad for a good game, go get it!			"

												Now alright. Let me get one thing clear. This game is expensive for the amount of content. $10.00 to buy your own crash and thrash ragdoll game is a little steep. But, if you like playing to get the most amount of points through crashing, its a good buy. I bought this during a sale or something, so I would wait for that. As a Burnout fan, I love this game. I like how there is enough customization to feel like you are vastly contributing to whats happening, but also makes sure you don't always know what's going to happen. Good Game 9/10			"

												INTRODUCTIONTurbo dismount is a game I've put a lot of time into. The graphics are great, the possibilities are nearly infinite, and the workshop has thousands of levels. If you want to get the game, yet you are still slightly skeptical, here's my review on Turbo Dismount.STORYOh, story. Yeah, this game has none! The most a completionist can do is play all the pre-made levels and get all the achievements, which will still take around 20-30 hours. The point of Turbo dismount is to mess around with what you got. I've (so far) put around 27 hours into the game and I still can't get enough of the game.FEATURESThe game comes with some levels to mess around in, but you can always download levels from the steam workshop if you get tired of those levels. You can choose several vehicles, which are all unique in their own way. There's a Tricycle, Fire truck, Wrecking ball, Skateboard, Sports car, etc. If you are wondering, you can choose different characters that can pose and be customized. One of my friends had fun putting the face of Donald Trump on his character, then he would do whatever he wanted to. For poses, there's tons of them, exclusive to each character. Yes, you can do a Miley Cyrus pose on the wrecking ball, and you can do poses on the Wastelander (Inspired by the Mad Max films) that are related to the movies. There's also obstacles you can place down such as a speed boost pad and ramps.GAMEPLAYAfter choosing your character, vehicle, pose, and obstacles, you have to hold down [SPACE BAR] to adjust speed. It's a frustrating task because if you release it at the wrong time, you can go really slow, or way to fast for you to comprehend.  I can still use turbo pads to go fast though, because I usually want to go fast. Characters can have their bones broken, dismembered, twisted the opposite direction, etc, and makes the game more interesting. The physics engine is not realistic though. Once I was using a skateboard and my head got blown off from a wooden paddle when I was only going around a smooth 20 mph ( around 32 kph for foreigners).AUDIOThe SFX is clear and more realistic than the physics engine. The sounds bones crushing and muscles tearing is what gets me. I probably wouldn't have laughed at this game if SFX and the music weren't there. The music is a jazzy rhythm, and makes the game seem like an overly-edited fail compalation that you can control.PLAYABILITYThe game has barely any glitches, and recieves laughs from anybody who watches it or plays it. It has the perfect blend of humor and control of paths that I like. This is a must play when my friends come over, and we end up putting 1 or 2 hours of into it everytime. We can laugh at the insanity that happens before our eyes when our character gets blown up by a mine and afterwords mauled by a snow plow. If your mind is thinking ""Why would you laugh at that, ONLY SADISTIC MINDFREAKS WOULD LAUGH AT THAT!"", well I have a claim. Your so called ""character"" is a test dummy, and the game is only a simulation. Also you would be calling Jacksepticeye, Markiplier, Pewdiepie, Kwebblelkop, Ssunde, Ihascupquake, and DanTDM sadistic mindfreaks ( If you don't know who they are, look them up on a trusty site I call Youtube).SUM UP:DO I RECCOMEND THIS GAME?I reccomend this game to a certain crowd. If you are easlily offended, than no. Despite a couple cons, it's definitely the most fun I've had destroyng stuff on my PC (Just Cause 3 is on my XBOX One, so I'm specifying to PC), and is no doubt, a ""kinetic tragedy""(that's the games slogan)My rating? 8.25 out of 10. You can play it with friends, family, yourself, and can see what sort of crazy things the community has done because I forgot to mention that you can upload gifsBy, InfernoLizard64			"

												I have played Stairs dismount and Truck Dismount for years and I liked them very much. I saw this and I thought for such a little price I could not lose. I chose well. This is an exellent game. This is a game I feel that Michelle Obama would like this game because it does not have any fat children in it.EDIT: Now for a real review of the game since it has now gone beta. If you liked the first two games you will enjoy this one very much. There are many levels to play and objects to place for the wide assortment of vehicles to crash into. Good old Mr. Dismount is back and you can smash and dismember him to your hearts content. There is a Workshop with many excellent user -made levels and a level editor (you download the components seperately). The leaderboards are fun to pursue and the community seems quite decent. Updates come fairly regularly and they usually include some new item like a new level or vehicle or obstacle. Also, you can customize your character with a face or bobblehead of your choice and make a custom logo for the vehicles. The game is tight, the physics can be a real riot sometimes but all in all it just adds to the game. I have never had a game crash or any other issues with it, though MacIntosh users seem to have the most problems so take that for what it is worth. The Devs even respond on the board quitye often so for $9.00 USD  (as of this writing) you are getting your value and then some.			"

This combines some of my favorite things in video games: crashes, explosions, complete character humiliation, derp moments, interesting maps, and instant replays (mainly the instant replays). You can play for the points, or even for the fun of it. You can create the perfect recipie for success, or fail and laugh yo head off. Either one is fine.

												Turbo Dismount is awesome. I honestly thought I was gonna play it for maybe 20 minutes and then never play it again (it was on sale for a very cheap price), but it's just too fun. It features many different levels that come pre-installed with the game, a wide selection of vehicles, and the ability to see a crash dummy ride a bicycle into oncoming traffic and causing the biggest car crash you've ever seen. One of the best parts about this game is the large amount of content that you can get from the Steam Workshop. Seriously, A BUNCH of levels for you to try out and crash in. If you're looking for a game that doesn't suck, get this.One more thing...the replay value (which I have seen in other reviews). There is so much replay value in this game.			"

												So remember in the original ""Flatout"" games? There was like a kind of bonus side game where you could drive your car up ramps and shoot your driver out of the car, aiming him for a giant dartboard in the sky, or use your driver to knock over bowling pins after he crashed through your windsheild.Better yet, remember ""Burnout"" where you got the challenge missions of crashing your car into oncoming traffic, trying to get as many points as you could by causing a pileup?You do remember them?Well this game is those, but with added bells and whistles (you can position your driver on various places on the vehicle for maximum impact or damage, manually drive the van or tell it head off in a preset direction, stuff like that.) Fun, but I liked Burnout's version better.			"

												Is this a good, playable, and enjoyable game? YesHowever, it is not worth the $10 pricetag unless you can easily spare this money. I bought this game on sale for $4, and I feel this is a fair price for the game. Why?With the steam workshop, you will probably get around 5 hours at max on this game, and this is the sole reason the game is not worth the $10 in my opinion. It has a degree of replayability, but you'd eventually get tired of the same track your car follows, the same amount and place of obstacles, and the small maps.The crash physics are mediocre, and if you want an automobile game with great and realistic crash physics along with a decent amount of mods and replayability I'd reccomend beamNG drive. This game's physics are more fictional and cartoony, but this isn't a downside, rather a different concept. To the developers (What I think needs to be improved to make this game worth the full price):- Ability to drive custom paths- Ability to mod custom models, veichles and veichle properties, obstacles, and physics- More detailed and textured models, add aesthetical variety to the different maps- Add the ability to place unlimited obstacles wherever, not constrained to certain spots.- Larger maps not constrained by an invisible box but instead more aesthetical pleasing walls/mountains/ect.Again, the theme and concept of this game isn't bad but indeed ""cartoony"" and unique but it needs more features to lengthen it's replayability and add some elements of sandbox. If you enjoy this type of game it's $4 sale price can be a reasonable buy.			"

												When I played PAIN for the PS3, it was mostly just a fun little time waster that I would play for minutes at a time before I either managed to pull off the stunt that I had been trying, or I realized I had other games that I wanted to make progress on.Turbo Dismount is a lot like that. Unlike PAIN, however, I found Turbo Dismount more entertaining.PAIN had optional objectives that you could complete at any time to unlock a few things here and there, but any sort of objective or unlock system makes screwing around feel kinda weird and almost unenjoyable. You feel like you're not accomplishing anything, and there are things that you might want but you won't get by messing around. PAIN also had an immature sense of humor (using a donut shop to make♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes? Seriously?) that just turns me away for some reason.Turbo Dismount on the other hand, has no objectives or unlockables. In other kinds of games, this would be a VERY BAD THING. But in a game like this, it works really well for some reason. Choose a level, select a vehicle, and hit the accelerator. And hocus pocus, just like that, you've caused a major traffic pileup (you jerk).Another great part of Turbo Dismount is how smooth the replay system is. The replay system in PAIN is oddly awkward to use for some reason, but Turbo dismount somehow gets it incredibly right by giving you no controls other than playback speed and camera movement.Turbo Dismount also features dismemberment (that is not at all gory, because the characters are pretty much just crash test dummies), which makes everything SO much more satisfying. You'll find out what I mean when you ask yourself ""wait, what happened to his head, and where's one of his arms?"" then you realize that you have no idea when he lost his head/arm, and you don't know where they went. And that all works really well with the replay system, because you can find out what happened to said head/arm.Turbo Dismount is just a fun little game to waste time on.Another thing: this is just a more interesting version of Stair Dismount, which you can grab for your smartphone. But this one is WAY better.			"

I honestly could sit at my computer and spend a few more hours thinking about what else I could give to compliment my emotions for what seems to be throwing a body with my own face into a lane of full traffic, but I'm still too busy trying to get away from doing exactly that.10/10 would obliterate my body again.

												I played Stair Dismount when it came out a while ago and it was fuel for hours of fun. Then this came out. It's all the fun of lobbing ragdolls off cliffs with the added bonus of vehicles and slow motion replays. You can create more levels for the game using the Unity editor and port them into the game and upload them to the workshop where other people can play them. While the extent of what you can do in the editor is fairly limited right now, it is still in development so you can definitely expect more features to come.Pros: - Great physics engine - Decent variety of vehicles and poses - Ability to replay your dismount slow motion - User created levels on the workshop - Obstacles you can place in the levelCons: - Limits to what you can do in the editor			"

								This is such a small simple little game, and yet it is probably the most fun thing I have ever played. You pick a track, you pick a car, you pick a general direction you want to go, you rev it up, and you let that sucker go! You can sort of kinda steer a little, but hardly being able to control it is part of the fun. All kinds of carnage can ensue, and best of all you can even slap your face on the ragdoll AND put a logo on the car. How cool is that!? You still don't have Turbo Dismount? Well what are you waiting for!? It's only six bucks and runs fabulously even on not-so-great computers. Get this game now. I guarantee you, you will not regret it.			"

Game of the year!Also, there's a level dedicated to Thelma and Louise entitled ""Let's Keep Going.""			"

								This is such a small simple little game, and yet it is probably the most fun thing I have ever played. You pick a track, you pick a car, you pick a general direction you want to go, you rev it up, and you let that sucker go! You can sort of kinda steer a little, but hardly being able to control it is part of the fun. All kinds of carnage can ensue, and best of all you can even slap your face on the ragdoll AND put a logo on the car. How cool is that!? You still don't have Turbo Dismount? Well what are you waiting for!? It's only six bucks and runs fabulously even on not-so-great computers. Get this game now. I guarantee you, you will not regret it.			"

												TL:DR Wreck♥♥♥♥♥♥and laugh like crazy. Totally worth the cost.For a longer explanation, Turbo Dismount is a ragdoll physics game where the goal is to get the highest score possible by damaging your vehicle and yourself. There are various maps, track objects to place, positions, and tricks to accomplish. Hilarity is added when you attached a picture of yourself as a bobble head on the ragdoll. Get discombobulated while looking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Good times!			"

												A girl riding her motorcycle for the first time,- towards a minefield just before crossing the highway- swarming with cars.Both arms broken + one leg, head dismembered and a foot that's missing. Welcome to Turbo Dismount.Make your own level, play a default one or browse the workshop for some crazy uploads.The game features replays in slow motion (if desired), a bunch of different vehicles to use, buckload of levels and though not many, the achievements are pretty easy as well as funny to achieve.I like to think of the game as a simulator for traffic/crashing. At least that goes for the ragdoll-effect and how bad you get injured. :scythe:			"

												Turbo Dismount is surprisingly good, considering its minimal price. Players have the ability to make, play, and share levels; meaning that the game has endless playability.

								Turbo Dismount is here... finally! I've played Stair Dismount around 100 hours and I still play it. This sequel is amazing and it's not because you can crash into a truck with a tricycle going 60 mph, it's the diversity of vehicles, maps and the customizable face.Imagine. You are angry with your brother/sister/dad/fiancé and you are so mad that you want kill them. This is the game for you, where you can crash their faces against a wall, cars, cones and many other obstacles.You are warned that this game is still in Early Access but it's going to get better and better, now with your permission I'll start dismounting my BFF.Best Kinectic Crasher Simulator 2014: 999/666			"

Fun while it lastsTurbo dismount is a interesting game and keeps getting better with each update. With workshop support, you can get enough levels to play this game for a pretty long time. After a while though, the game starts to get repetitive and is not much fun. For the price this is still a great game and worth it.			"

From the creators of Stair Dismount comes the greatest ""How far can you fling your own head"" simulator.

												This might be hard to believe, but this man is the leader of a group of lizards from the hyper elite. I know this first hand. I took care of this being as the mentor, as I am a hyper elite of the syntax-sector of the Illuminati. I have experimented with teleportation, Obama, and lizards shape-shifting into Secret-service agents. When the syntax-sector of the hyper elite barracks in the north pole, most experiments broke loose. This prototype, however, was smarter than most. With little to no signs of lizard-like structures when shape-shifted, he was the perfect man for our job. I once used my transformation powers, but was quickly spotted, and the extra-molecular shape-shifting superdinosaur came and saved me, with the hyperbeam harvested from Dialga in the Pokemon dimension. Yes, that show is real, made by the Ancient Gods from Sector-B//AnimationDimension//X-3, we transported the creatures into the ""intelligent"" planet called Earth, in my opinion, the weakest sector of the whole Illuminati. If you want more information about these creatures first hand, contact me via Google+ or teleportating to the hyperdimension in Class-A.			"

								For those sadistic people out there (and there are alot of us), this game continues the madcap fun of the popular handheld game Dismount where the opbject of the game is to cause as much physical pain to your friendly test dummy as possible on various scenes.  This version continues that theme, but now instead of just giving your dummy a poke to get him/her moving, now you have various vehicles and poses to make it all the more fun.   If they keep adding more scenes and dummies to collect as they did with the handheld game, this should be just as fun, if not more so.			"

												This is the greatest non-RPG, non-business-management sandbox game I have ever played. If you're the kind of person who loves seeing epic car crashes in movies and watches said crashes over and over again and also likes watching those crash compilations on Youtube, then this game is sure as frick for you. It's cheap, it's blood-free, it's diverse, it's open, and it's garunteed to make you smile at least once.			"

												Twas' a beautiful day and Jimmeh decided he would take his fire engine for a spin. His friend Jimmeeh was driving. Because of the motion of the fire engine, he started pelvically thrusting the building. It looked as if he were to be dancing. Then The thrusting became more vigorous and yet more vigourous. Then the driver of this violated fire engine was  like ""THIS IS MY TRUCK"" and at that exact moment in time his body vigorously soared out like a pidgey being shot at.  And then whilst running through the air his arm vicously decided it would merge with his foot. and his arm was no more.Then came the MINES He was surely of a deceased state at this particular moment in time however Turbo Dismount decided to rub mines in the wounds The mine struck the fatal blow and Jimmeh Sanderson of Glasgow was a pile of some legs (possibly a hand aswell maybe even a neck or a shoulder).

And try to attempt epic jumps over busses failing every time. 10/10 would crash again.			"

												I watched some let's plays of this game. I thought that it might be pretty fun.And it was.For a short matter of time.The gameplay itself gets really repetitive and boring after short time.It's just watching a ragdoll get crushed and hit by things, all over again.Well, you can occasionally take a screenshot of the said ragdoll making a funny/goofy pose, but that's pretty much it.There's not too much variety of vehicles or maps, at least not right now.Speaking of vehicles, their destruction is pretty simplistic, not much detail, which is just... meh. Yes, I know, it's Turbo Dismount. It has it's own style, but, I just had to type this. In the end, I'm complaining, right?...Now, the maps - If you decide to download some from the workshop, which you will probably do, because the default ones get boring pretty fast, you're just going to find those:-Minefield-Manual driving obstacle course-If you're lucky, maybe something original and pretty alrightAdditional, little complaints:-Touching anything makes you lose control of your vehicle.-No option to choose a default camera.-The PRICE. Come on, €/$10?In conclusion, gets boring really fast and is really repetitive.Actually, what would you expect from a crash test game?...			"

It's a lot different from Secret Exits other game, Zen Bound (2). The YouTubers that have played this game have also given it a boost in popularity.You are Mr/Mrs Dismount. You like destroying yourself and cars. You somehow have unlimited supply of every car. Explosions inbound.9.5/10!			"

												This game was fun for a while.I have bought this game and returned it after owning it for 2 weeks and playing 14 hours, and i can say i had my fair share of laughs and fun with it, but personally i got bored of it pretty fast and started playing it less and less. I don't believe i ave the power to convince another to do something else, and as many other people like this game i believe my opinion wont change anything.I don't think its a terrible game. I just feel like its an acquired taste that many people have, but some don't, and thats me. Its fun wore out fast for me, and I didnt like the need to install fanmade content to have more fun.In conclusion, it's not a terrible game but for some people its fun can wear out fast. The need for fanmade content ruined the experience for me, and in that sense, i do not recommend it.			"

												This is a simple but very fun game. You can change the levels a little bit and play with multiple vehicles. True the levels that come with the game are limited but thankfully this game has workshop, so people can create new levels. I'm enjoying the game so much that I subscribed to every single level in the workshop (almost 300). Looking forward to the new updates and I really hope they add more achievements. It's really fun trying to accomplish them. Money well spent. It is worth it.			"

												I'd really hate to put a damper on this game but it's sadly one of those games that's a novelty more than it is an actual game, It's more fun to watch than it is to play.It's really dull, you just rev up the car, pick a pose, let it rip and watch the guy go flyling. You get a small laugh out of it but afterwards it's just really dumb.If you watched it on youtube and watched it until you can't laugh anymore, this game won't be any good to you. It's value can easily be ruined, even by watching it.If you still want to play the game anyway, by all means go ahead. It's stupidly funny but it's just easily boring in minutes and if you watched it already, you might as well not buy it.			"

								BEST GAME EVERY!!! An amazing crash-simulator game! I was so excited for this game to come out on steam and it has MUCH more features than the demos. I voted for it on greenlight hoping it would get on and it did! This game is epic and has very realistic physics too!!! :)			"

												1.-Buy the game2.-Play it3.-You realize you can customize your character and logo so you download the first two images you see in google4.-Open the game again.5.-Realize that you don't know how to customize the character with the photos because you are blind.6.-Search in google a tutorial for that.7.-Follow the tutorial8.-Enter the game and realize you just had to click on customization.9.-Play a map with the wedge10.-30 mins later you think it may be fun.11.-2 hours later you played all the maps with all the cars so you decide to download maps12.-3 hours later you have downloaded and played more than 15 maps. At least 2 of them have infinite cars at great speed.13.-4 hours later you start to mess around a lot more than before but you still think it's funny14.-30 years later, all your relatives have died and you have pancreatic cancer. You are still playing11.69/5 - IGN Would make other people suffer in horrible crashes again.			"

												This is a game that allows you to just♥♥♥♥♥♥around with ""physics"" using methods of transport such as cars and desk chairs.The premise of this game is pretty much to inflict pain on your little ragdoll who is always in some way attached to your vehicle.Eventually after doing this for some time in sure you will find yourself becoming bored within only so many hours.8/15 - ""Fun but gets boring quite fast""			"

												Not at all a deep game, and you don't actually get to drive any of the vehicles. So, it's not really anything like HappyWheels, which is a disappointment. The meat of the game is picking obstacles to put on the map, pick a vehicle, and determine how fast it will go on it's imaginary rail. So, from an interaction standpoint, it's actually a bit dull.But the reason I've put a few hours into this is that the physics engine is really good (aside from the cars that make up CPU traffic weighing about 5kg's each), and the rag-doll mechanic is consistently funny in at least a minor way. Plus, it's what I'd call a 60-second game: you can play it in the few minutes extra you have between being ready for work and actually having to leave. Really, it's a good way to get a chuckle if you are running ahead of your schedule and have a few minutes. It's the sort of game you can enjoy without needing more than a minute, unlike many games, and it's cheap enough that the lack of depth isn't a problem.But only if you can get past the lack of interaction. The spectacle is fun, and there's enough options and choices to set-up your crashes and jumps for the vehicles, but my recommendation is only a marginal thumbs-up since there's no actual driving and the spectacle is only going to get you so far. Again, you can't actually drive the vehicles, and the level of interaction is very low besides just choosing a car, speed, maps, and placing a couple obstacles. But it's worth it for a game to have when you just want to have a laugh in the minute or two before having to do something else.(FINAL NOTE: Around 10 of my hours were gained because of forgetting the game was on after I went to bed. As I said before, it's not something you'd expect to put much time into, but the time does add up if you mess around 5 minutes here or there during a work-week or school week. Really, I think I'm at actually a little over a dozen hours).			"

								This game is awesome. The first time I tried  the wep preview and seen it was on greenlight I said ""Oh my god, this game is so getting on steam."" Then about a mounth or two later, it was on steam. If you never heard or played this game, go to www.turbodismount.com for the web preview. I first found out about this game by my favourite YouTube gamer, PewDiePie. I seen him play it and he had a link in the discription, when it came out on steam he made a video of it and I wanted it so bad. I got it on March 20 2014 Thursday 5:30. Now thats all I have to say about this great game. GoodBye!			"

												I really really like this game, however it is not one of those games that you play over and over and over again, its one of those games where you play it for a few hours, don't play it again for a week or so, then you start playing it again, well except for when you get it, you're probably all over any game when you get it, unless you got it for bragging rights. Overall I fairly enjoy this game and on a scale of 1-10 I'd give it an 8.75, the only thing I'd like to see isA) A tutorial on how to make workshop levelsB) A better ""Freecam"" for when you watch your character get obliterated!

												As a great gamer, I have come to the conclusion for my Turbo Dismount.Gameplay: 10/10This game has more physics than a GTX 780 Ti's CUDA cores. As the player you have to well, drive the cars/bikes/vans/quads/buses/birds that love you. Yes. Cars can love you. So get in love with a Golf R.Maps: 9.75/10This section could recieve 10 if the Workshop had a map for 420,069,666,360 points. When playing Turbo Dismount, play the map called ""Keep On Going"" or ""Highway"", as these can give you 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 points respectively.Price: 9.75/10This section could recieve 10 if the price wasn't in the same league as the more popular Garry's Mod and Undertale. As the price of £7 is great, I just wish it was £5. This is because the cheap gamer has 3 options, this, GMod and Undertale.Overall Rating: 99%For all you 4 year olds who are going to comment ""What does that number mean?"": 9.9/10Percentage ratings:Gameplay: 100%Maps: 97.5%Price: 97.5%			"

												I rode into a highway and was hit by a truck, smashing my body into thousands of pieces. 10/10. IGNIf you're a person who wants to experience chaos, let off some steam, of just screw around, this game is great. There are so many different ways to crash your cars and kill yourself (Trycicle into landmines for exapmle) you can just create so much chaos and madness. The game can also glitch and freeze at times so that's a little annoying. The graphics aren't great, put I'll let it slide. Even from all of it, the game can get old at times and you just don't play it for a while. Overall, I'd say this is a fun game, but could have some work. 8.4/10			"

												Turbo Dismount is a game about driving a little guy into/through obstacles. If you have watched any gameplay on Youtube, this game does look very fun.But if you don't like laughing uncontrollably at a ragdoll's limbs being torn off, this game is not for you.If that is you, the only fun you will get with this game is seing if you can get your tricycle onto that truck in that one level (What was it called, Drainpipe or something?) or watching your guy crashing into something then rewind it, fast forward it, rewind it, fast forward it...If you have TONS of creativity, then yes, you will enjoy this game.But other than that, Turbo Dismount is just watching a crash test dummy get pummeled.It's not that fun.

												One of the worst games in my library.At first, this game was a little fun but after finishing all the levels in the game, it got boring. I know you can get steam workshop levels, but after you beat them and dowload more, they end up taking space which makes it terrible. DO NOT WASTE $10 ON THIS GAME. Even if you do get this game, get it on a sale. This game would be okay if it were free, but it is not.			"

												After about an hour playing; I failed to really see the plus side to the game.Sure it's great at first, watching your vehicle/avatar drive around and crash into an array of different traps/walls/traffic etc.But really, each of the maps plays out the same, the different options in vehicles, poses and barriers you can place are all just slight variances.And most of all, there's no real way to get better, or progress, or anything really. It's simply a game to have a little laugh with, and not really worth the money in my opinion.(P.S: I can usually create my own progress/longevity in games, even by creating my own leaderboards/leagues or something silly to test myself or see improvements etc. This game isn't even conducive to that, once you've destroyed the guy on each level there really isn't that much more to achieve).

But it just doesn't hold your attention. Now I know that the Devs update the game, but it just isn't enough content. If it was a Free to Play title I would definitely recommend everyone to try it, but sadly it is not. It is still a very fun and well-polished game and I hope that the rest of the Steam community doesn't take this review as an insult to the game.			"

												This game is a pure example of why YOUTUBE is not reliable to get your games from. If you get games from there. I found out about this game because of Jacksepticeye and Markiplier hell, even pewdiepie. They made the game look relativily fun and I was intrested in buying it. I got the game when it was on a deal and got it for 5 $ I think. To be honest, this should be lower then that, even though it was just 5 dollars. The game is fun at first, but it get's dull very fast, the only type of gameplay in this rollercoaster of experience is 2 clicks on your mouse.... That's it. Click it to start, click it again to measure the speed that the dude will go off the ramp, road etc. It is very enjoyable at first but like I said it get's dull very quickly. The physics and replay time really make the game hilarous, once again at first. But if you tell your friends the same joke again, again and again it just isn't funny anymore. That's where the game falls sure there are maps and diffrent setups you can do on maps, but it just want's to tell you/us the same joke over and over again. Trust me not worth your time, get someting that will keep you entertained for a longer period of time.			"

												If you can get it on sale, thumbs up. If not, it is just too buggy to be considered a finished product. I always avoid early access and would not have bought it if it still had the early access tag attached. There are times that the car will not even take off and you have to keep cycling the camera or the poses while constantly resetting in hopes of getting the game to do the one thing that it needs to do in order for the game to be considered functional. At $3.99 I can't consider myself scammed or anything but at the very least, it needs the early access tag back. There needs to be a clearly defined line between what one should expect from a finished product and a beta.			"

												I had not played Turbo Dismount in a while.  Fired it back up last night for the first time in maybe three months and was presented with an ad which I had to click through.  At some point, they ""updated"" this game with ads.  Sure not a big deal, just one click.  But it is a big deal.  Why am I only willing spend $2 at the iOS app store?  Because at any moment, the developer of a game can ruin it with ads or facebook/twitter nags or some other horrible thing.  I laugh when I see a game at $10 in the app store.  But I buy games on Steam at this price point, and higher, a couple of times a month.  If Steam allows itself devolve into the cesspool which Apple's App Store has become, then I am not going consider games above $2 there either.Do not purchase this game.  Do not support this behavoir.  And let Steam know that when we purchase something from Steam we expect them to protect our purchase.			"

												TL;DR: The cameras ruined it for me.The camera always seemed to be in my way.  You can select a camera, but when you switch the autosteering (recommended because the manual steering isn't very good) it sets your camera back to ""vehicle camera"" even though that's frequently not the best choice to choose an auto-steered route.The cinematic camera frequently provided the best combination of view distance, height, etc., but you can't rotate it.  I felt like a lot of really entertaining stuff was heppening, but I didn't get to see it because of the cameras.			"

												First off: I don't truly hate this game. In fact, there are quite a few good things about it - the degree to which you can experiment with the numerous obstacles and veichles to get different outcomes can be impressive and the courses themselves well-designed, encouraging maximum destruction and crazy hijinks all throughout. Workshop intergration is well-done, with a bunch of user-created levels to play around in, and of course there is always a good laugh to be had from a crash dummy getting as screwed up as possible.But the fact of the matter is that it's nowhere near as interesting to crash a car for the 100th time as it is to crash it for the first. After about 3 hours of play, I grew incredibly and extremely bored with the repetition of crashing, the bland style of the game, and with the lack of variety overall. After a while, it starts to all feel like 'same old, same old' - just the same freaking thing over and over again throughout and throughout without much difference. Even the Workshop levels (which tend to blow things up the absolute extreme) can't stop the monotony from breaking through.You might like this game a lot more than I did. You might find the game's explosive antics a lot more amusing than I ever would. You might be crashing cars way more times than I could ever bear. But for me, this game is nothing more - and nothing less - than what it is: a virtual way to crash cars. Over and over and over and over and over again.5.4 / 10			"

												It's very entertaining. But, only for the first few runs. Then, it feels like you're doing the same thing again and again. The physics do the game well, they have very nice ragdoll feel to it. The controls are a bit jerky and rough, ESPECIALLY when your trying to look at your replays. The replay system is very well put together, it gives you that ""Batman Arkam Origins"" detective mode feel. Overall I'd give it a 7 out of 10.			"

Yes you can customize it just a little but not a lot. You only have like 10-15 maps to play from I cant remember though. In my opinion its not really worth the $10 that you spend for this game. Its a game you spend like 3 hours on and you have pretty much have done everything on and tried everything. This game is good but not good at the same time. Like I said at the beginning its good for the first few hours and then it gets a little boring and repeditive.			"

												This game is just crappy in many different ways.Here's why:-Crash physics aren't that good (parts just fall off instead of getting crumpled)-NPC vehicles are uncrashable (except the fact that they won't move after you crash then)-Vehicles and maps aren't detailed-Vehicles aren't customizable (except for decals)-The wheels and the chassis are immortal-The graphics are crappy-You can't turn on your brakes, and all your vehicle does is go forward and never stop, but you can steer, but that is all the functionality you getJust skip this game and pass.

												Do I recommend it? Personally, no. It is perfectly functional, but calling it a 'game' is not really accurate. It is a ragdoll physics simulator. There are no goals, no progression, no interactivity. You pick a vehicle (of which there is certainly a fair variety as far as looks, but no real differences besides small/big/fast/slow), click a button, and watch the vehicle crash into obstacles. That's it. You can even play almost the exact same thing on the developer's website for FREE. It is well made, looks and sounds great, and seems to have an active Workshop community. But I just don't ""get it"", so I would feel wrong recommending it. Especially for the $10 price tag.			"

Early Access Review
								Honestly, this game is seriously lacking. It's not bad for all of the 10 minutes of content that there is. It looks fun,  but what you see is all that there is. There's not too much destructability past what you'd expect, and the levels are few. Some good ideas for vehicles, but there's no controlling them past launch speed and the 4-5 preset paths. I'd give this about a 2/5. Also, there's 3-4 preset placements of a few objects, but they don't change too much.			"

												I highly do not recomend this. Its very similar to goat simulator, BUT YOUR A CRASH DUMMY ON WHEELS! You smash stuff,  destroy yourself and your car, and you do it in a funny way that makes you laugh. Other than a wide-ish selection of cars, which you cant make or customize, and the obsticals you could put in the trap, there really isnt a lot of oppertunity in this game. I know a good game, this you get bored of it in the first ten minutes of the game. YOU CALL THAT GOOD?! The only reason people keep buying this game and thinking its good is because of the youtubers point of view when playing this game. It sucks when you control with the wheel because its hard to maneuver, when you play all the stages your gonna go like ""What now?"" and just quit because your bored of the game. The game is bad! I HIGHLY do not recommend this game.			"

												Honestly, this is a hyped up game promoted by youtubers. It's poorly optimized and if I try to run it, the whole room starts heating up and I am forced to close it from discomfort. There's not much variety here, because it's just you setting up a scenario, viewing what happens, and that's it. The only things you control are the vehicles, positions, obstacles, and paths. 17 times out of 20, nothing happens, and when something happens you get really bored of it very quickly, because the guys head flew off or a truck hit him, but there's nothing other than dismemberment and your vehicle getting broken into parts. Everything else is unbreakable, and it's just like a bunch of blocks.			"

												Less funny than it looks like. Basically you get a bunch of tracks, vehicles, characters and obstacles to cause accidents. You have less control than it seems, you can place objects only where the game allows you to. Basically you have to push a button and let the vehicle crash into random stuff, far from being interactive.The physics it's far from perfects, every vehicles (especially the NPC ones) are mostly made of rubber and don't even get wrecked. The ragdoll effect is acceptable, but I've seen better. I don't see the point of having different characters and motorbikes if they can't ride them for more than a few seconds and barely reach the obstacles you have placed. Every other vehicle is mostly useless, ranging from huge, slow and totally unfunny to see crashing to intolerbly fast cars, seeing them crashing after a second from start. Also most of the time your character will fall out of the vehicle before crashing anywhere, thus ending the session very early.Other than that, you have to follow some predetermined steering paths which the vehicles can't even follow correctly. You have manual steering but it doesn't make the game any funnier.The default cameras are placed very badly, not letting you see anything. You have to use the manual one which is barely good depending on how you can handle it.It could have been a good idea, but it's very badly developed. I would rather wait for a fully functional BeamNG.			"

												This game is utterly euphoric. I felt enlightened by smashing a tricycle into oncoming traffic while my rag doll (who had the face of my real life competition) fly into space, only to fall back onto the highway where he was hit multiple times by a bus, a sedan, and then some weird snow plow thing. I then proceeded to try to imitate this as I am an impressionable gamer who the media likes to blame. I do not recommend reenacting this game in real life, as it angers and bothers people, but do Indeed highly recommend this wonderfully delightful game.			"

												Do I even need to write this for you? Fine. This is probably the only game on the planet that doesn't require you to think. (Besides Goat Simulator.) And it's a bloody good time of a game, even if you don't know how to think. There are alot of cars/bikes, my favorite being the (oooh!) Pink Lightning. Lots of obstacles, ranging from landmines to brick walls to turbo pads. It also has steam workshop, though it only makes levels. (I'm still wishing for a workshop that can make cars. :c) And the ways that Mr. Dismount can die, oooh the ways. You can even put faces on the poor head of Mr. Dismount. I put a koala bear face for the face and put an Australian Flag for the car logo. (Oooooh, the stereotypes.) I recommend you get this game if you don't refuse to play something that requires at least a bit of effort. 10/10.			"

								Really fun. Made buy guys who are very experienced with the dismount style physics games, and they've made Stair Dismount, a somewhat similar one for iOS. I didn't realize they were one and the same, the dev, but it's refreshing to know that his game would be good from the starting logo. It's intuitive with a lot of custimization, first person camera, vehicle cam, dismemberment, breakable cars and trees, traffic, changeable driving paths, placement of objects and  3+ different poses for each vehicle that are all bound so if you sit on the side of the back of a monster truck, you won't just slide off. Fun levels, and a lot of variety for a small early access game. If you like physics games and simulators, like Algodoo (Phun), then this is a must buy for you. It's also a really great game to get while you're waiting for BeamNG and The Next Car Game, but you should play this after they're released too.			"

								What can I say about Turbo Dismount? It's really fun and sometimes goofy. Nothing else I'd want to say....Okay, maybe some more.I've been playing this game ever since it was played on a browser. When I heard it was put on Greenlight, I went straight for it, no questions about it. A week or two after it was released on Steam, I spent $7 on it. When I started playing it, I was surprised by how the game changed from the browser and then into Steam. I really enjoy it.Nowadays, I just play it about once or twice about every week.If you're curious about whether you should buy this or not, then it's worth it at a price of $7. ---Guff McGufferson			"

								I think I found the one game that could entertain me for hours and I would never get bored!  Turbo Dismount is a hilarious crash simulator game that will have you laughing until your sides start aching!  The basic object of the game is to find different ways for your little dummy to wipe out by changing the vehicles, obstacles, poses, and direction to make the dummy crash in the most hilarious ways possible.  That's really all there is to it; it's just pure and simple fun!  I highly recommend this to anyone who owns a PC!			"

												This is one of the few games in my collection that I can play over and over laugh every time and not break out in a fit of gamer rage. Even getting low scores, outcomes not working how you expect, it doesn't matter because it soooo amuzing either way. Do not let my hours on record fool you, I've been a huge fan of the original ♥♥♥♥♥sturvat (Stair Dismount) and Rekkaturvat (Truck Dismount), and have logged hundreds of hours for well over a decade. Secret Exit takes Turbo Dismount to a whole new level and beyond since tA'At. If you are a fan of causing destruction, inflicting pain on helpless dummies, you either need to be locked up or you should see a therapist but luckily for you, you can cure these tendencies with Turbo Dismount! Drive off ramps into moving traffic, catapult off cliffs, push it down the stairs like a butler trying to claim an inheritence from a weathy person, attempt to send your dummy to space and watch it come back to earth with such velocity that its dismembered. The fun goes on and on. Lastly, if this doesn't convince you, nothing will but check out the screen shots in the community hub. You really can't help sharing with everyone how amuzing this game is, and if these shots don't, well you really should see that therapist because theres something wrong with you. :)Although, there is one small disappointment with this game. I wish it were a little more sandboxy as placement of aperatures, driving patterns, are limited to certain areas. Regardless, I highly recommend this game! 9/10			"

												Do I even need to write this for you? Fine. This is probably the only game on the planet that doesn't require you to think. (Besides Goat Simulator.) And it's a bloody good time of a game, even if you don't know how to think. There are alot of cars/bikes, my favorite being the (oooh!) Pink Lightning. Lots of obstacles, ranging from landmines to brick walls to turbo pads. It also has steam workshop, though it only makes levels. (I'm still wishing for a workshop that can make cars. :c) And the ways that Mr. Dismount can die, oooh the ways. You can even put faces on the poor head of Mr. Dismount. I put a koala bear face for the face and put an Australian Flag for the car logo. (Oooooh, the stereotypes.) I recommend you get this game if you don't refuse to play something that requires at least a bit of effort. 10/10.			"

												Have you ever used the Player Pratfalls cheat in Saints Row or did the Insurance Fraud activities? This game is pretty much like that. The whole goal revolving around the game is try to get your character ♥♥♥♥ed up as much as possible (and your car) to score points and achieve high scores. This game isn't to be taken as a real game but as kind of a stress relifer or maybe just play it for those times you just wanted to see someone get their body flinged around like a ragdoll in Gmod with a thruster attached to it.

								As far as games go, this is just simple and ridiculous fun.  Play for points if you want to, but just watching the dummy windmill and pinball between cars is its own reward.  About the only feature missing that I'd want is a way to save a replay, but aside from that, this is an absolute hoot.			"

								Put the face of your worst enemy on a disturbingly animate crash test dummy (or IS IT?) and cause them to partake in horrible, violent destruction to themselves and whoever is driving those cars in traffic made out of cardboard boxes. See how far you can fling yourself in the air, see how fast you can run down the road, see if you ramped your chickenmobile high enough to get up that ramp so it can cause a massive traffic accident with the remains of your vehicle and yourself lying around! Try different obstacles, driving routes, and cars, oh the cars. You get everything you need, from a slick, fast sports car to a motorcycle to a firetruck and even more carbon-friendly fare like a tricycle, a skateboard and a shopping cart! So you can care about the environment while you run yourself and others into bricks all over the road! Then watch replays of your havoc at different speeds, camera angles, rewind, pause, whatever! Oh and yeah, the chickenmobile. God bless the chickenmobile. What more could you ask for? Yeah it's in Early Access but it plays just fine and really, is this the kind of game you're going to get up in the air over bugs for? Actually sometimes they make the game better! Like the time when I crashed my shopping cart, causing me to get stuck in it, and then my cart went upside down and bounced up and down repeatedly ramming the ground, accumulating point after point til the timer came on and ended it. I got enough points to send me straight to number 54 on the leaderboard of that level. That's the essence of this game. Go for it!			"

								What can I say about Turbo Dismount? It's really fun and sometimes goofy. Nothing else I'd want to say....Okay, maybe some more.I've been playing this game ever since it was played on a browser. When I heard it was put on Greenlight, I went straight for it, no questions about it. A week or two after it was released on Steam, I spent $7 on it. When I started playing it, I was surprised by how the game changed from the browser and then into Steam. I really enjoy it.Nowadays, I just play it about once or twice about every week.If you're curious about whether you should buy this or not, then it's worth it at a price of $7. ---Guff McGufferson			"

								I think I found the one game that could entertain me for hours and I would never get bored!  Turbo Dismount is a hilarious crash simulator game that will have you laughing until your sides start aching!  The basic object of the game is to find different ways for your little dummy to wipe out by changing the vehicles, obstacles, poses, and direction to make the dummy crash in the most hilarious ways possible.  That's really all there is to it; it's just pure and simple fun!  I highly recommend this to anyone who owns a PC!			"

								Plain and simple fun. There's something about watching a ragdoll being horribly dismembered by oncoming vehicles that brings out the best in almost everyone. The best part is that there are plenty of user-submitted levels to try out. Think Happy Wheels, but with more vehicles and a 3D perspective.			"

								Turbo dismount is a small game with lots inside, it is unbelifeibly fun and unlimited situations they are adding more into the game.My idearsI think they should add a differnt type of wall and destroyible objects like a destructible car so you can crash into another car and also i would like it so you can choose a speedlimit not just by chance but each vehicle has there own speedlimit.also the vehicles i would like them to add.Limo ATV2 more sports cars1 more van truck with trailer but not articulated tank (funny tank)and any other vehicles you guys can come up with.what i dont about the game is the 1st person camera, you guy cant keep stright and he keeps moving and its really tricky to get a normal veiw with it, but i understand that 1st person has just come out.but what i like about the game.the vehicles are fun and they look coolthe physics are amazing and insainly fun to play withthere is alot you can do and unlimited posibiltiesthis sort of game can make tones of stuff for it self so i think it can be a very good game so far i rate it 4star out of 5 but keep going add more maps, vehicles, and props. and just add a few more things and fix 1st person and then it will be a 5star.Turbo Dismount 4/5 star Great Game Rated By Rombus9 "

								It's a basic alpha, so there really isn't much to say about it - but I am still recommending this game at the moment because of where it *COULD* go.As of right now, it really is bare bones.  You have about 10 levels you can choose and you try and cause the most damage to your ragdoll / vehicle.  Some levels have traffic.  Some don't ... and sadly, that's really it, at the moment.  As it is, you can't even control you vehicle aside from the direction it will go and how fast it will travel.  Anyone familiar with casual games will see that this is just a 3D launch/physics game - a lot of which can be played for free.  What this game desperately needs is multiplayer and custom content support to give it any longevity.  As it is, the game is fun for about 20 minutes, but then loses its luster/In short, at the moment, I don't think it's even worth the $7 price tag - however, it's one of the most functional alphas I've played, and I have hopes for this game.  I also believe that it can co-exist alongside Next Car Game if the devs can make a niche for the game as a dumb wacky physics driving game.  And it is that hope that I am currently recommending this game.I hope Secret Exit won't let us all down.			"

								Put the face of your worst enemy on a disturbingly animate crash test dummy (or IS IT?) and cause them to partake in horrible, violent destruction to themselves and whoever is driving those cars in traffic made out of cardboard boxes. See how far you can fling yourself in the air, see how fast you can run down the road, see if you ramped your chickenmobile high enough to get up that ramp so it can cause a massive traffic accident with the remains of your vehicle and yourself lying around! Try different obstacles, driving routes, and cars, oh the cars. You get everything you need, from a slick, fast sports car to a motorcycle to a firetruck and even more carbon-friendly fare like a tricycle, a skateboard and a shopping cart! So you can care about the environment while you run yourself and others into bricks all over the road! Then watch replays of your havoc at different speeds, camera angles, rewind, pause, whatever! Oh and yeah, the chickenmobile. God bless the chickenmobile. What more could you ask for? Yeah it's in Early Access but it plays just fine and really, is this the kind of game you're going to get up in the air over bugs for? Actually sometimes they make the game better! Like the time when I crashed my shopping cart, causing me to get stuck in it, and then my cart went upside down and bounced up and down repeatedly ramming the ground, accumulating point after point til the timer came on and ended it. I got enough points to send me straight to number 54 on the leaderboard of that level. That's the essence of this game. Go for it!			"

												As a huge fan of the original Dismount (or ""-turvat"" games to us Finns) games since way back in early 2000's, I was thrilled to hear that tAAt/Secret Exit were actually working on a brand new Dismount game, though I was more into Stair Dismount and Dismount, but I digress.This game provides everything Truck Dismount did and adds a ton of fun obstacles, vehicles and other features to mess with for maximum carnage. Having everything unlocked from the start is good for people who are looking for a casual game and, for the more invested players, competing on the leaderboards for highest scores and downloading/making custom maps.If you've been on the fence on buying this game, I would definitely suggest you go download the free classic ""Truck Dismount"" and try it out. If that game strikes your fancy, you'll most likely find this game to be a worthwhile purchase.			"

												I played ♥♥♥♥♥sturvat (Stair Dismount) back in 2004 (ish) while the company was known as ""taat"", and I'm overjoyed to see more (excluding rekkaturvat - truck dismount and sauna dismount), especially with this level of variance.Those looking for a quick quote to describe the game should see the planned crash section of the Burnout earlier titles, only regarding damage to the driver instead of environment and cars. A large choice of cars, obstacles and level layouts make the fun last even longer to satisfy even the darkest of humour (and believe me, this is dark humour at its best, allowing you to logo your character and vehicles, then ploughing them into deadly situations).Brilliant at twice the price, and I hope to see more and more and more.

												Strangely addictive.  With the Steam Workshop, this has become one of my favorite games out of my library of nearly 200.  I can sit down and play when I don't have enough time to play larger games.			"

												Turbo Dismount is a gem of a game.The premise is simple: you control a crash dummy and your goal is to toss it against vehicles, obstacles and objects to get a high score. There is a fair ammount of customization in the game. The dummy can be strapped to a variety of vehicles (including rides from an office chair to a monster truck). Each of these vehicles allows you to select from different poses in which the dummy can be positioned. You can even upload a photo of a friend/enemy and paste it onto the dummy's head! There are also different stages, which range from simple straightways to huge intersections of heavy traffic meant to maximize carnage. These stages can also be customized with different obstacles like turbo pads, roadblocks or minefieds. The game also has steam workshop support, allowing you to download additional stages.After you finish customizing your dummy and stage, you choose a speed and direction and let the physics engine do its thing. The dummy and vehicle can be broken down in multiple itty bitty parts, each increasing your score based on how hard they hit objects in the stage. After things settle down the replay feature kicks in and you can see the carnage in slow motion. As far as I know there's no option to save replays in game. But you'll be creating so many spectacular crashes that it's not a big deal.While the premise of Turbo Dismount is basic, it has it down right. It calls to the simple pleasures of childhood, in which throwing your toy cars against makeshift buildings or laughing at people falling in America's Funniest Home Videos was all the entertaiment you needed. You always knew what was coming, but you couldn't help but laugh or wince everytime it happened. You may not put hundreds of hours into this game. Yet you'll be glad that when you want you can throw your toy car against traffic and watch the parts fly.			"

								Really fun. Made buy guys who are very experienced with the dismount style physics games, and they've made Stair Dismount, a somewhat similar one for iOS. I didn't realize they were one and the same, the dev, but it's refreshing to know that his game would be good from the starting logo. It's intuitive with a lot of custimization, first person camera, vehicle cam, dismemberment, breakable cars and trees, traffic, changeable driving paths, placement of objects and  3+ different poses for each vehicle that are all bound so if you sit on the side of the back of a monster truck, you won't just slide off. Fun levels, and a lot of variety for a small early access game. If you like physics games and simulators, like Algodoo (Phun), then this is a must buy for you. It's also a really great game to get while you're waiting for BeamNG and The Next Car Game, but you should play this after they're released too.			"

												My Top Game of 2014:This is game wher  creating massive car crashes, bloody messes, creating massive traffic jams, and pinging cars into space is normal!There are over 10 maps in which you can costomize the maps to with obstacles, some maps you drive cars up mile high ramps, others you crash them into walls, some you crash into 2 way highways, some you try to park your car, or even see how oblivious the AI are to their surroundings when you try to enter onto a highway..I play this game everyday, its a very fun game, with a great physics engine and exploding cars that disinigreate into 50 pieces after falling 600ft to a amzing death, with slow motion replays available after every crash, its impossible not to have fun with this game!Check out some videos of this game if you aren't completely decided yet, there will help you decide!www.youtube.com/probmgchannel

												Turbo Dismount is a game where you put a guy in a car, and fling him into obstacles. The idea is so simple, but provides almost endless hours of hilarity as you fling him into traffic or off a ledge, especially with steam workshop intergration so the community is always producing new levels for you to mash Mr Dismount on. I thoroughly reccommend this game to everyone has has at least the tiniest sense of humor.			"

Mr. Dismount or Ms. Dismount do their magic with obstacles in their way or/and couple or hundreds of cars and suddenly you will feel much much better.This game made my day - After hours and hours of playing I created this awesome video:


YouTube™ Video: TOTAL PENETRATION - Turbo Dismount - Let's play #1 

			Views: 66		

			After playing Doorways Chater 1 and Chapter 2 I decided to play something ""relaxing"". I searched on Steam and found this game - Turbo Dismount.		

It's 9 minutes of having fun and laugh. I have to say that at the first moment by trailer I thought so that it would be waste of money... But right after first accident I changed my mind :-) Basically it is a crash simulator with a possibility completely destroy Mr. Dismount or Vehicle with what you were driving. Also you can customize your driver aka Mr. Dismount on your own or someone who you hate and see what happens when he hits the ""obstacle"".And by the way - You can also create your own level! I bet that in the future there will be more and more awesome stuff... Upgrade after upgrade its getting better and better!...11/10...			"

								I think I found the one game that could entertain me for hours and I would never get bored!  Turbo Dismount is a hilarious crash simulator game that will have you laughing until your sides start aching!  The basic object of the game is to find different ways for your little dummy to wipe out by changing the vehicles, obstacles, poses, and direction to make the dummy crash in the most hilarious ways possible.  That's really all there is to it; it's just pure and simple fun!  I highly recommend this to anyone who owns a PC!			"

								Graphics may be a tad simple, even for what I believe comes from the unity engine, but the satisfying pleasure of smashing Mr. Dismount into kibbles n' bits is more addicting than it looks.Nothing is more satisfying than the red hot engine sailing at 100+ mph right into an overpass.			"

								I'll be straight with you people. I like crashing into crap. I like to break several bones simultaneously. I love it the most when both happen at the same time to someone other than me. However, to you people, your views may be different. So I complied a check list to see if this is for you. Do you enjoy misery from complete and total strangers? Yes/NoDo you find pleasure in 10+ car pile ups? Yes/NoDid you ever wonder, ""If I did something really stupid, would I live?"" Yes/NoIf you answered Yes or even Maybe to any of these questions, it's worth the 7 bucks.(P.S. The answer to if you would live or not is usually no. :P)			"

								Turbo Dismount allows the player to really have an endless amount of fun with such little resources. No dismount ever seems to be the same. I've been crushed by my car once, had my head crushed by the firetruck, and lost all my limbs because I hit the ground just a little too hard trying to perform an awesome frontflip and then land-on-my-feet-perfectly move. This game allows you to do whatever your heart desires, wheter it be taking off your head in a car wreck, or performing a flip in car, the fun is endless. I definitley recommend this game!			"

												Turbo Dismount; multiple things really. A sandbox? A crashing simulator? Kill Bieber simulator? A combination of all that actually. This is a game I can keep coming back to, pick up and play, and just have good old fun. Turbo Dismount isn't perfect however. I'll go over that later. I've owned this game since it came to early access, which it is currently OUT of. Here's a little list of things I like and don't likeMaps[/u]The official maps are well made. You can play the game with just the original levels and have fun for hours, but then theres workshop maps. You can make your own level which is pretty simple to do. You just need to download Unity. If you are new to Unity, don't worry the Unity website has plenty of tutorials. So far I've made about 10. They aren't hard to make, but if you are making a big level, then yes it will be time consuming and long. Theres around 300 workshop maps. Most are decent, some are just random things put down, or an editing level scene, or something just.. abnormal. You won't run out of maps to play though.Vehicles[/u]There are a number of vehicles, you cannot however make your own. Theres a whole bunch, all with different poses (at least 4 on each vehicle) so theres plenty to look at. Since the game came out of early access though vehicle updates, or updates in general have been scarce. But don't blame them, this is a complete game, not a beta or alpha.Charaters[/u]Hello, and welcome to the forgotten part of the game. Don't understand what I mean? There are only two charater choices. Look at other dismount games, with lots of charaters. But only two is just terrible. The devs just didn't add any, only Mr. and Mrs. Dismount. No different body types. BUT there are bobbleheads! Basically get a face of anyone from Nicholas Cage to yourself and slap it on your charater! It makes it more interesting, seeing someones face get blown off by speeding cars. But still, charaters are not great.A Bit More[/u]Yes, I do recommend this game. One of my favorite games in my steam library. There are a few bugs, some of which are gamebreaking. But in my honest opinion, Turbo Dismount should of had more done to it during Early Access. Lots of missing features that could make this game so much better! Workshop for vehicles, Saving Replays, more level creation assets, and more of everything in general. From obstacles to poses. But, you know what. I got 65~ hours from this game. Maybe you will and enjoy it. Turbo Dismount is a great game for anyone really. $9.99 to have fun with crashing cars and exploding celebarties! "

												This is only good if you have a hour to waste. I saw a couple YouTubers play this, bought it, played it for a few hours, kept playing it casually  for a month or two, then I left it. It gets so boring. The workshop maps are bland. 10 bucks down the drain. You just run your car into mines or some stuff, then after 2 minutes, your bored. This game should be free, for crying out loud Team Fortress 2 is free, and it's a Valve masterpiece. YouTube made this famous, now this game is a sinking ship, boring old gameplay, that  you get tired after 10 minutes. But once the ship has sunk, (If it hadn't already) Secret Exit will release ""Turbo Dismount 2"" at double the price, with the same boring gameplay, a couple new cars, and a couple new models. Don't buy it, use your 10 bucks to buy Team Fortress 2 keys, or CS, or use your 20 bucks to buy CS:GO, or Gmod, Or, TFC.			"

Its so fun because you get to customize a person's face on it and then kill them with it. You also use different cars like the wedge, pink lightning, street slicer, token bird, etc. Also some levels have the most craziest amount of cars I have ever seen like Bus Serpentine and Over 9000.

I just can't help but play this game when I'm bored, it's probably one of my favorite physics games. It's really fun, and I reccomend it to everyone.			"

								Turbo Dismount allows the player to really have an endless amount of fun with such little resources. No dismount ever seems to be the same. I've been crushed by my car once, had my head crushed by the firetruck, and lost all my limbs because I hit the ground just a little too hard trying to perform an awesome frontflip and then land-on-my-feet-perfectly move. This game allows you to do whatever your heart desires, wheter it be taking off your head in a car wreck, or performing a flip in car, the fun is endless. I definitley recommend this game!			"

								This game is probably one of the most replayable games I've ever played, and as long as more features continue to be added until it's final, it'll stay that way. Only downside so far is the lack of a built-in level editor; but I'm sure that will be taken care of in the future. As of now, the game is well worth the purchase, but don't expect a game that you can play 24/7 and not get bored.  As of now this game provides hilarious short-term entertainment that keeps you coming back for more. Keep up the great work!			"

												As much fun as it is to crash Mr. Dismount, it felt very random how many points I would get for a particular crash, which made trying to be ""good"" at the game a matter of grinding as two very similar crashes would result in dramatically different rewards in terms of points. All in all, I got bored of this game very very quickly.			"

I highly reccomend this game, because doesn't get boring fast. Also, you can download stuff from the Steam workshop for it. If you've never played it before, play the free app first to see if you like it. The Steam version has more vehicles and stuff.			"

												A simple, smooth-running game where you try to get the highest score by making Mr. Dismount crash in the worst ways possible and let physics or other vehicles do the rest for you. Sometimes, the physics can get rather wonky and the result is a hilarious car-crash that will make you laugh so hard you'll forget that Mr. Dismount has unfortunately become Mr. Dismember, for your own entertainment.  There's a multitude of maps, vehicles, and characters to choose from, and there's also community-created maps. Does the game have a point? Well, maybe not, but it's silly and simple fun that you can have when you're bored and/or you're feeling sadistic today. It might not be something you'd play for a thousand hours unless you're an expert and have a PhD from dismounting, but it can sure entertain you for quite a while.			"

												I had my character have the ""Me Gusta"" face, Named him Gustavo Toiletwater and sent him into traffic on a pink tricycle. This game has a sort of repetitive style that only gets old after playing it for eternity. But what makes the game at its peak is its neverending humor. Basically you send in one of 7 characters on a big and growing array of vehicles into levels that could be the last place Miley Cyrus could ever see.I would recommend this game to anyone who- Despises a specific person- Loves seeing the pain of others- Pretty much everyone really.

Physics - The game's physics are very good, for the breaking of the cars to the snapping of bones. This affects the game as phyisics are a crucial part for this game.3. Overall - There is not much to the game, but it is still very enjoyable, I DO reccomend this game. :D			"

												Pick a track, pick a car, pick a character, rev your engine and DISMOUNT!!I'm normally not interested in simplistic games; I prefer a well-made RPG. But this game... A certain youtuber might've influenced me a bit in buying this game, but I wasn't disappointed. This game is very simple on the surface, but it offers a lot of options for blowing up- uh, I mean guiding your character through traffic...I'm not even going to bother explaining what makes this game so awesome, that speaks for itself. But if you're looking for a quick outlet for your aggression, or just a ridiculous past-time, then you should buy this game. It's pure and simple fun!Also, fear the chicken... Fear it!			"

												If you like ragdoll physics, wacky vehicles, wacky physcis, this game is for you! To be fair, the devs update the game with new vehicles, characters, and maps very often. For a cheap price you get a game that has tons of replay value, good devs, good updates, and a cheap price. Therefor, I recommend this game!			"

												It's games like these that really touch me deeply. These fun, ragdoll based, destruction games that really get me adoring gaming as a whole. Turbo Dismount is an exception.Yes, I just said it: Turbo Dismount isn't a very good ""earn points by killing yourself"" gameNow let's just start with the pros, because ironically, there are more pros even though this game doesn't fit the genre it tried to fit in:Pros:Tons of posesSweet, sweet vehiclesCustom head and decal featureObstacles that can be freely placedReplay systemOnline levelsSteeringCons:Tons of posesCertain vehiclesHaving the uploading your own image for a decal or head and screenshot/artwork sharing in the same gameOnline levelsSteeringNow I'm not saying at all the Turbo Dismount is a bad game, it just doesn't include any features that want to keep me invested. The terrible online levels just ruins the game as a whole. I've had seen like 5 ""For Jacksepticeye"" levels on one page. So, should you buy it? Yeah! This game isn't exactly perfect, hell, it has obvious gaming nirvana, but it's definitely something you should try if your looking for laughs. 7.05/10			"

You can also beat your record. It's just a really repetitve game and there's not much else to it.			"

												Well, as someone who played a surprising amount of the old Truck Dismount, it's kind of funny how this much more fleshed-out game somehow seems to lack an indistinct something as compared to the old. But I won't hold that against it. What I will hold against it, though, is that you can't save replays anymore! Half the fun of Truck Dismount was swapping replay files with my friends and then we'd all watch them and be like oh man ha ha! Not so much now. Enjoy that catastrophic wreck you just caused now, because once you leave the replay, it's gone forever.All that said, this is what it's supposed to be: a pretty darn fun way to kill a few minutes. Also, they've been adding content to it lately for free, so that's neat.			"

The characters poses and animations are fun when they crash. That's about it. Even at 60% discount, I'm not sure it's worth buying. But if you really love that kind of stuff, you may want to take it while it's on sale.			"

												Very fun game, in a crazy sort of way. Basically to have a track, a vehicle and a test dummy. The goal is to cause as much damage as possible for points, and you try to beat out the previous best score. Here is the kicker, you can add stuff like booster pads, ramps, brick walls and landmines for uh...testing purposes.Oh and did I mention you get extra points for amputations? "

												The whole purpose is to get the highest score on a level by dismounting a character from a vehicle with a really good physics engine.  You do this by setting up an obsticale course and choose what speed to send them off on.As well as choosing the route you want, you can also drive the vehicle, but it's hard to control.Definitely pick up this game.

												This game was Awesome! but... only for the first hour. i had almost no problems with it, the crashes are always spectacular, though there was no in game recorder to record the spectacular displays with, so if you do an amazing crash (lets say you crashed into a pole and then got runover by a truck, then a car, then the pole colapsed and your head flew off) you cant easily record this (i had to spend 20 mins trying to find a good game recorder). Now for the workshop content - great! player made tracks! But no workshop content for any extra cars, or vehicles. so sadthis game could have been great! but unfortunately these two things it was not :(- i would recomend this to anybody who already has a game recorder, or for anybody younger than 10- i would recomend beamng.drive over this - more expensive and more demanding, but so - SO mutch more worth it- will not be refunding this game due to my younger brother - of which is younger than 10 (he loves it, for now)  5--- 10			"

												Turbo Dismount is a Funny, action, family friendly, indie simulation that is a lot of fun to just mess around with, alongside your pals.  It's a game where anything goes, and the more destruction you cause, the better.In Turbo Dismount, all you do is pick a course, pick a character, pose, vehicle, and maybe some obstacles, and see how far into the course you can make it without total destruction. It's a very fun, little, simple game. Some of the poses that the characters do on certain vehicles are just hilarious, like, the one wrecking ball pose. But, the vehicles all have different speeds, so, some are better suited for some maps than others are. But, the ones who are fast tend to be the ones who get destroyed faster, so, go ahead! Try them all out on every map you can get your hands on! Also, there is Steam workshop, so you can find all kinds of levels there.Overall, Trubo Dismount is really fun. I really enjoy it. It's not the best game out there, but it is fun, and I do recommend it, escpially over the mobile version of this.			"

This game has a sort of repetitive style that only gets old after playing it for eternity. But what makes the game at its peak is its neverending humor. Basically you send in one of 7 characters on a big and growing array of vehicles into levels that could be the last place Miley Cyrus could ever see.I would recommend this game to anyone who- Despises a specific person- Loves seeing the pain of others- Pretty much everyone really.

A certain youtuber might've influenced me a bit in buying this game, but I wasn't disappointed. This game is very simple on the surface, but it offers a lot of options for blowing up- uh, I mean guiding your character through traffic...I'm not even going to bother explaining what makes this game so awesome, that speaks for itself. But if you're looking for a quick outlet for your aggression, or just a ridiculous past-time, then you should buy this game. It's pure and simple fun!Also, fear the chicken... Fear it!			"

												Okay, right now, many of you are probably looking at the price and the game play and shaking your heads, i did the same, but i watch the YouTuber Markiplier, and i realized, this game is worth it. right now the game has sort of reached the end of its development, i don't know if the developers are planning on any DLC or making any new massive updates. So when you start playing for about 2 hours your gonna be as board as an orc at a social event. So here's how you make the game more fun, you go into the games customizing, and take a funny picture of your face and put it on the dummy. it makes it so much funnier and you'll cringe every time you see your beautiful self get smashed into pieces by other FTL cars, yes for some reason everybody on steam workshop thinks cars move faster than light and its both ridiculous and funny to play around with. this is a game to just sit down with your friends and do stupid stuff.Now i have to warn anyone who is interested. It is easy to loose interest in this game, what you see in pics and videos is really all you can do. a few months ago they added manual steering which is awesome, but again it will drag. so only by if you really just want a nice relaxing game that you don't really need a large attention span for. i seriously play this when watching tv.Is it worth $9.99? well that's a matter of opinion. if you'd ask me, its cheap, the developers could have been jerks and tried charging you $14.99 or more. i recommend this game for anyone who loves hanging with their friends and family, its a great game to see who can go the farthest, loose the most body parts, or who can go the longest without cringing their face in horrid starring.Its also a great game to show to your friends who have drinking problems, trust me, it'll make em stop. Also, please drive responsibly everyone and thank you for the time in reading my review.			"

The objective in it is to wreck your car and you little crash test dummy!Pro's:Tons of customization (You can customize your character's pose, what vehicle you want, and even put pictures on your car and even your characters face!)Easy to play (The game's learning curve is practically a tiny bump.)Teaches people what happens when you drink and drive.Cons:If you play it too often, it can get a bit repetetive. But if you just use it as a time waster and don't play it constantly, that repetetiveness goes away.Morale of the game: DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE.			"

												Chances are you want this game because you saw a video on Youtube and the guy playing was laughing uncontrollably and you want a laugh as well. I laughed pretty hard maybe twice. Not saying its a bad game, but some people hype it up alot. The levels and vehicles are plentiful and interesting. It loses it charm after a couple hours of play, but the devs update often so they keep it interesting again. You might want to wait for it to go on sale though.			"

												Is it worth getting if it's on a Steam/Humble Bundle sale? Yes.Is it worth $10? No.The game is fun, for a few minutes at least. There is little to no interactivity, and there isn't really much to do. The entire game is click dismount, watch ragdoll crash into car, click reset, and repeat. A few bits on the car falls off, maybe a limb falls off on the ragdoll, and that's all that happens.			"

								I killed Mr. Dismount by throwing him into traffic. Ms. Dismount is now a widow. I shall comfort her.But really, if you liked the app, you will LOVE this. So much fun watching wrecks in slowmo. Makes me laugh. Devs did an awesome job so far, and they allow modding your own maps as well. For seven bucks, you'll definetly get 7 hours or so of fun out of this. If you have a friend to compete with, even more hours. If you install modded maps, even MORE hours. And this is just early access, they will probably add a lot more to this game, thus giving even MORE hours of fun killing Mr. Dismount and claiming his wife your own.			"
