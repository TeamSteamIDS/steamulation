												Disclaimer: I've owned this game for quite a long time, well before it became available on steam. I've put literally hundreds of hours into it, so the time shown in my steam profile isn't reflective of my experience with the game.This is one of, if not the best operational level wargames I've played. It's the next logical step up in complexity for people who are comfortable with games like Panzer Corps, Unity of Command and Commander: The Great War. It is both realistic and complex, yet still accessible with a rather gentle learning curve. That said, Blitzkrieg from Warsaw to Paris is quite deep, and you'll be learning something new about the system with each campaign you play. Included with the game is the 1939 invasion of Poland, the invasion of France and the Low Countries and a hypothetical invasion of Great Britain. There are other minor scenarios available, and tons of variants to keep things interesting and unpredictable. There are also elements to the gameplay like playing decision cards which make Blitzkrieg from Warsaw to Paris unique among its contemporaries.I recommend this game to anyone who is interested in wargames and ready for a greater challenge (HQs, supply and logistics, etc.) than what is available in more introductory level wargames. Blitzkrieg from Warsaw to Paris presents these more complex concepts in an approachable and elegant manner, resulting in a rewarding and thoroughly enjoyable wargame experience.			"

												Sadly can´t recommend, if you like me expect at least some realism and don´t only want to ""beat the system"":- very bad tutorial, exhausting usability, ignorance of KISS-principles, manual explains nothing in detail- Very clunky, user unfriendly interface (no undo command, bad overview of units, ...)- very unrealistiv combat results (open field, non-entrenced, retreated morale-low infantry without AT-guns not only delays but outright defeats 100+ panzers..., crowded chaotic mega-stacks of morale-low units withstand one and another coordinated attack by combined arms... Surrounded? Hefty losses? No supply lines? HQs and Utility Units in combat? Wayne, we nonetheless hold the line...)- air force and artillery effect way too low (but many losses because of one (!) enemy AA-Unit...) - impossible to deploy real blitzkrieg-tactics: overall too slow unit movement, no strategic (i.e. no combat) movement bonus, too hefty AP-penalty for ZOCs/attacks, attacker penalized by system & too many losses overall (e.g. germany lost about 1% combat strength in the polish campaign, here you try to stay below 10%), no motorized/mechanized/armored overrun system, enemy uses HQ/AA/Artillery-units to block and slow the advance without consequences, because they just retreat in order, attackers have no AP left to attack again... rinse and repeat..., no surrender of surrounded units without attacking them...- way too random results (roll the dice aaaaaand...)- confusing display of combat results (and nearly no explanation why things happen the way they do)Sad, because the game has its strengths:+ nice, easy supply system+ very easy air force handling + medium complexity, easy access to game system (between PanzerCorps and WitE)+ easy organization of corps units+ rewards for good planing+ good atmopshere+ coop play possible+ interesting historical variantsBut all in all: We are not in the 90s anymore... perhaps in a sale.

												Like operational strategy games?Like WW2 scenarios?Like a 50% sale?then add to your basket (for the amount of hours your going to get out of this, i would buy even without the sale)There is something about this style of operational strategy wargaming that is appealing and Decisive campaigns nails just right, easy enough to get right into it, with enough depth to keep you occupied and learning, the maps, unit cards etc for this style of wargame excellent.. for me pure strategy gaming at its best.Replayability - There is always that new plan to try, para drops at strategic locations - panzer breakthrough to link up or massed artillery with infantry push..air support, the possibilities are endless but dont forget to factor in supply or bonuses your generals can bring.There are a lot of operational ww2 wargames out there, for me this one is at the top 10/10.Thank you Slitherine, cant wait for Decisive Campaigns: case blue to come on steam.

												This is a refreshing old-school hex war-game that doesn't ignore the fact that computers can do book-keeping abstractions better and deeper then Europa type board games, You get all of the minutia of old school games with 100% less rules lawyering.    So, yeah, you are going to have to work a little harder then a lot of these type games, but not much harder.  The in-game tutorial gets you started, but if you don't go through the manual you're going to screw up.  Maintaining operational and support channels from OKH to divisional units is at first frustrating, and a bit of a learning curve, but you were the one who wanted to invade Poland.  The game makes sure you can get the gas, bullets, and beans where it needs to go, but you're the one who needs to include those logistics in your strategy.    Happily. once you get it, IT really comes together and you can get on to wrestling with the issue of conquering Western Europe.  The Sealion scenario, and linking Case White, Case Yellow, and Sealion into an extended unified campaign is brilliant.			"

												Excellent wargame.  I hope this sells well, because Matrix needs to put more titles on Steam, at these great prices.  I never try these games because they're too expensive to try from their website.The author of this title is really involved in the community.  There are a couple graphical overhauls that update the maps and unit graphics really nicely.  I'm really getting into the first scenario, which is exciting.  I have had every Hearts of Iron, and I love those games, but to be honest I haven't been able to really play them.  This game is very playable, and gives me hope that I'll be able to better tackle HoI in the future.			"

												The tutorial is good and gets right to the stuff you have to know.  There is no standard interface for this kind of war game, so you need a good tutorial on how to set up attacks, get supply status etc.  The icons are pretty clear for what they are doing and you get visual feedback on how your attacks went and why.Another good sign is you can let the AI run longer so it can find better moves.  IF the AI is good I will add to this review.  As of now, if you like wargames it is worth a try.			"

 Decisive Campaigns  Series I recommend very warmly this turn based little gem strategy game at operational level with a very good intuitive interface&gameplay mechanics not overly convoluted , for those who want a greater challenge&have free time to spend - and also a more detailed historical background regarding the units in combat ( im still struggling with first map - Poland - but that's because I set the campaign on hard difficulty ) - the description on the game page is very accurate from my POV - i eagerly await the release of DC3 - Barbarossa :D - 10/10 !

												After 30+ hours, I can't seem to get enough. Even after losing first campaign in Poland by 3 points. Always one more turn. The unique play makes it very interesting. I consider it one of the better operational level games I have played in a while. More meat than Unity of Command, yet not a huge learning curve either. Just have to think about what you want to do and how to do it without a lot of casualties and in the fastest amout of time. It is tough. I recommend it highly, but wait till a sale. It is a older game and not worth $40. I found it hard to even pay $19.99, but it has been worth it so far.  Be prepared to spend a lot of time with it thinking ""what If I moved here.....: or ""what is in that hex"". Seem to never have enough recon planes!			"

												Simply an amazingly good WWII operational computer wargame.The controls are intuitive - the graphics, while not stunning, are very clear - the gameplay is both deep but with an ease of play which is surprising.Played against a human opponent, the fog of war and strategic options make this a top shelf game.Heavier than Unity of Command (another excellent game) simply due to unit density and operational options.Highly recommended for anyone into computer wargames.

												Well, this game is well worth the money.Pleasently surprised by the way this game plays and am just exploring still but the game has many gems.The AI is good and does what a good opponent should do, I gave up on strategy games because of poor AI but this game has got me back on the hook.So I have played more and can seriously say this game is a gem.Do yourself a favour and give the manual a quick once over as there are a few details that actaully add to the gameplay.

												Decisive campaigns is a great series in terms of getting to play within the confines of history. Be sure to check out Decisive Campaigns: Barbarossa, which I still don't see on Steam. That's how I got hooked on this series and I just bought Case Blue and Warsaw to Paris because I wanted more.  That one is the latest in the series and it reflects the human aspect of operational command unlike you will find in other games.			"

												This is my favorite wargame and it isn't even close.  It has a great scope, good operational and tactical combat, and so many varieties.  MP options are amazing.  Nothing like having 7 idiots try and cooperate to barely conquer Poland.There are a ton of number, but overall integrity and readiness should be enough for most people.  Combat value is more of an estimate than anything, but troop quality is a big part of that.10/10 DC3 please come out soon.			"

												As mentioned before, this is a game that sits between Panzer General and War in the East. The card system gives you plenty of variation for replays. Poland and France put up a bit more of a fight than you would expect but there would be no challenge if the campaign allowed Germany to steamroll the opposition. The campaign allows you to play as Germany in the Polish and French campaigns as well as Sealion if you perform well. It is possible to play as the opposing armies in scenarios. The game has play by e-mail multiplayer. The game is not difficult to grasp and there are Youtube lets play videos that will clear up any confusion.If you enjoy hex and counter wargames this is for you, although the newst title in the series (currently Decisive Campaigns: Barbarossa) may be a better purchase.

												Very detailed wargame of the operations involved in the invasion of Poland and France. Optional sealion scenario and lite RPG card aspect. Fairly easy to play and pick up but there are many units. This theatre of war isn't covered to much in many games and there is a lot of scenario text to keep you interested and learn some history. There isn't quite a game like this one and will offer and interesting wargame experience. Requires dedication to finish through a scenario with many customizable options and what-ifs to give you a bang for your buck.			"

												This is just advanced tactics gold with steroids.But the most annoying thing is the LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG LOAD times, saves take decades, turn passes take centuries....Anyway, it's a good game, not so hard detailed as i would like, but if may fit for the ww2 newcomers.Also, the price is too salty for a game like this.

												Excellent wargame with just the right dosis of granularity. You have to take account of command and control and suplies, but without bogging down in micro management. It´s my first ""decisive campaigns"" title and I´ll probably get the other ones too.			"
