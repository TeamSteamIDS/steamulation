												UPDATE 28-04-2014So I haven't been very active within Blockland and only recently I've learned that Return to Blockland has been shutdown since February. Well, bugger. One of the biggest things on this review was RTB's existence.Not to worry! The community has already found ways to circumvent its shutdown and there are backup pages and a whole new chat addon thingy that imitates RTB's.Backups: http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=253292.0IRC Chat: http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=255973.0(I SERIOUSLY hope that Steam doesn't block the links any time soon. If it does, let me know and I'll fix it.)I haven't tested them and I don't have time to. But as far as I can tell, they all look pretty legit.By the way, here's a cool FAQ I've found in case you have any questions: 


Blockland Steam FAQ 
A Guide for Blockland
By: Demian

			Some basic information about Blockland and frequently asked questions that have popped up on the Steam discussion forums.		


//////////////////////////////////////This game might sound cheesy for some people at first glance. ""I mean gee, a game where you play with legos online? What is this, people never heard of how bad Roblox turned out to be?!"" (Personally I like games where you build stuff very fun, that's why I bought Blockland years ago in the first place...)Oh trust me, it's a lot more than that. This game is like a fusion between Garry's Mod and Legos, but FAR easier to play. You can do pretty much anything in a stylized block world - houses, cities, deathmatches, survival games, racing tracks - and a lot more with its intuitive building and eventing system. Eventing is a sort of very very easy ""scripting"" within Blockland that you can use to make certain blocks to do certain things from within pre-set lists of actions that you can do to the block for it to do something you want and a lot more. It might seem very overwhelming at first, but when you start playing with it you'll get used to the idea quickly.Building, in my opinion, is a little bit trickier, as you have to move ""ghost blocks"" around with the numpad (or some other buttons if you're on a numpad-less laptop) and then press enter to deploy a block, and they cannot be floating, nor penetrating the ground or other blocks, unless they are to be built within a Zone Brick which allows you to make actually floating blocks inside of it, so you don't have to make invisible supports for every floating island you might want to do. Buiilding is also very well optimized as you can do a number of moves with the ghost bricks to get them where you want and how you want quickly and efficiently; there exists a macro system where you can ""save"" the moves you do to a block so you can replicate patterns like stairs and stuff like that without much of a hassle. However, building can be clunky as you have to take blocks from a list to put them in your block selection list - you can only carry up to 10 blocks at a time, I believe. However don't let this limit your creativity, as you can do pretty superb buildings in this game as evidenced by the game's great community - there is lots of support for this game, the developers and its players won't hesitate to help you with any problems you might have with the product, and there are just a LOT of addons in this game that do not allow it to ever be boring, especially with the Return to Blockland addon which is basically a community hub for the game, complete with a chat room, news, and a ton of other addons that are mounted into RTB for easy access, deactivation and (un)installation. RTB can also be downloaded for your server so you can get new Administration features, get the addons of your server listed in the server browser, so the players don't have to download it directly from your server (given they're hosted in RTB), and a few more features.WARNING: Read the update above first. RTB is no longer functional, but there are backups.Making addons for this game is, from what I understand, not tremendously difficult, and as long as you have the talent and willpower to make that one brick you can't find but need, or to make that weapon of your dreams, have a Ferrari in your garage or just a simple addition like a new face for your Blockhead, or maybe a song you want your Music Brick to play, all in all there is no (?) limit to the addons you can make for the game. I wish I could write from experience, but unfortunately, apart from a song or two I didn't make any addons for this game.What I WAS ABLE TO do however was host servers and oh boy, coming from a person who can't ever host servers because of his connection not ever letting people connect, this was a HUGE plus for me. Even the player with the most blocked-off router can host games for their friends and never be hindered by issues like tremendous lag or timeouts, in my experience I found the netcode of Blockland to be very good. At least... I think this is the netcode's doing.The gameplay is very appealing and so are the graphics, as they are very beautiful and, unsurprisingly, very colourful, stylized to look like a cartoon, similar to the likes of TF2, except on legos. Yeah. Graphics for me are very hard to describe. The ""maps"" (or just... plains) are roughly customizable so they have bodies of water or different types of surfaces, which can spice up the game a bit - I've always liked to build in maps with lots of water.Overall, the game is very enjoyable and on the right servers it can be a ludicrous amount of fun. It is really amazing how such a simple and cheap game like this can provide so many hours of entertainment, from messing around with a few people to doing giant, elaborate buildings, from having mindless fast-paced deathmatch to having class-based capture the flag matches on carefully structured builds and just so much more. Blockland is truly a game for the ages, despite a few flaws like clunky building and some instances of lag when there are too many bricks within a server or when they're being duplicated.I have this game since V12 and now it's on what, Vtwenty-something or so, and from there and now I still recommend it to everybody, kids to adults. The only thing I DIDN'T like is how they got rid of maps in an update months back. Back then you had maps like Bedroom and Kitchen, that were... well, semi-realistic bedrooms and kitchens. I REALLY liked those! But hey, they needed to take a radical action to let the game evolute and that was the end result I suppose...TL;DR: This game is great! Totally recommended! A bit clunky to get started, but you'll get used to it! Lots of addons to help you, client-side and server-side! The graphics are also beautiful!			"

												I love this game but I absolutely cannot recomend it.Don't get the ""not reccomended"" wrong - this IS a good game. A few years ago I'd definitely have recomended it, but now it's dead. Blockland is a game where 90% of the content is produced by the users in the form of mods. Badspot, for most of Blockland's history, actually helped these modders by modifying the game engine to better suit their creativity. This helped keep the tiny community alive. A service called RTB was released by a game modder called Ephialtes* - it had a friends list, private chat messages, IRC, and allowed people to download mods directly to the game. This is probably the main reason Blockland had any form of community at all.This has changed. Badspot released an update that would remove maps and replaced them with slightly improved graphics. Seems to make sense, since you can just build everything with bricks, right? In actuality, the brick limit is atrociously low** - on the other hand, terrain could be set to loop indefinitely. We were able to get around this by making the terrain on maps and building on top of the terrain. Now, terrain can only be done by one of two methods:    1. Building it with bricks    2. Modular TerrainOption #1 leaves vehicles entierely out of the question, because the vehicle physics are atrocious - they are guaranteed to get stuck over and over again, and there's little to no smooth slopes because bricks are boxy. You CAN make brick terrain look good, but it takes an insane amount of bricks and you'll likely hit the brick limit. You can phase right through a brick if you're going fast enough in a vehicle.Map Terrain vs Brick Terrain: http://i43.tinypic.com/2rc1ulh.png Option #2 is modular terrain, which is bricks that have smooth ramps. Slightly better, but it's ugly as sin and still contrained by the brick limit. You can also phase right through it if you're going fast enough in a vehicle.Modular Terrain: http://pixpipeline.com/s/eaf878362c19.jpgBadspot will NOT fix many of the issues, most notably the ones above. The modding community has practically pushed the game to its limit. Badspot prefers to argue instead of fixing issues. Many of the good people have been driven away. The community has been stripped to a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ weaboos who crack at least one 9/11 or holocaust joke every two minutes. There's many other problems with this game, but this is how calm criticism is handled at Blockland: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54466069/banned.pngLastly, and most importantly, Badspot is simply unprofessional -- he accuses the people who don't like the game's development path of being ""entitled"" - but if anything, Badspot is entitled. These veterans produce most of the game's content in the form of gameplay. They host the game's servers for free. They are where all of the content comes from, and Badspot refuses to update the game to better suit their creative impulses. Blockland would never get anywhere without them.Many major Blockland people have plain left due to these problems. People such as Ephialtes and Kalphiter. This game is great - but now, it's dying.I wish Badspot or really anyone would make some kind of sequel and start all over again and get around the development problems -- I would buy that straight away, and I'm sure the vast majority of the community would too.Do I recomend this game? Unfortunately, I simply can't. *I'm talking about the new RTB, not the original v0002 one. Yes, I know it's technically been around for years but the old RTB has little in common with the current one.**Although the brick limit was raised, it is still atrociously low if you want to have a massive terrain map.

Abandoned by a careless developerFirst:Don't be fooled by the game's trailer. Blockland isn't a lego universe full of fun things to do and intresting people to meet. This game is a trap. I have been playing it since it's earliest days (I was literally one of the first hundred people to buy this game). It was fun at the start when there was still clans and builds and gamemodes were still new and exciting. But it hasn't risen with the times. Nothing new has really been made since 2010. It WAS a very fun game to play, when there was still new things being made and that could be discovered. But nothing like that has happened for this game in a very long time. And with years the community deteroriated to become what it now is today. And the patehtic community of this game only more so worsens it's already near-broken state. Blockland is only kept up and running so Eric can leach more money off it. Little has he done to update it or improve it in any way for a long time. And guess what, he doesn't care. He's literally said multiple times that the only reason he is still giving Blockland even a fraction of his time or effort is because it makes him too much money for him to stop. And when I say a fraction... I truly mean even less than that. He has done nothing and put virtually no effort into improving the game or updating it in any way that the players or the community would appreciate. The game is NOTHING like it is in the trailer. Sure a lot of that stuff shown in the trailer is possible but I can personally garuntee that not a single server being hosted at this time has anything even close to that exciting or unique. The community for this game is virtually nonexistant (unless you're dying to be in a commuinty full of autocratic ♥♥♥♥♥). I have not seen a gaming community full of more hostile and irrational people in my life. This is why all of our servers have nothing good. People on the forums site are pathetic. They do absolutely nothing to upkeep the game or make it better in any way, and spend virtually all of their time ranting on about how the community sucks and making drama threads pointing fingers at users when in reality EVERYONE on the site is doing the exact same thing for the game: NOTHING. Which is why it sucks! :) No, you won't be doing anything like what's in that trailer. Hate to break it to you. Unless you want to spend days learning how to make all of those things yourself and submerge yourself in a community full up stuck up arrogant ♥♥♥♥♥♥, don't buy this game.To the insightful developer comment I recieved below: (This was ORIGINALLY his response, before he changed it to what it is now)Badspot:""So we're looking at a negative review of the Blockland community from someone who aimbots in counter-strike. Nice. Blockland: Generally disliked by cheaters.""Last played Counter-Strike: Source: Apr 24, 2011 11:14am1 VAC ban(s) on record	 | Info88 day(s) since last banNice. But, I think not. Recieved the VAC ban from being KL'd, and you can't appeal them. However, I do like how when responding to negative reviews of your product you deviate from actaully addressing ANY of the problems users mention about your game and instead try pinpoint things you find wrong with them to use as leverage against everything that is wrong with YOUR game and how YOU are chosing to manage it. Though it doesn't suprise me in regards to how I have seen you manage our community over the years. You want to talk about professionality? Rather you would search for dirt on people who write bad reviews of Blockland instead of actually addressing any of the problems that are wrong with your game? I suppose you would, and not really suprisingly... :/http://prntscr.com/2qsz4oAbove is an example of this games professional developer banning a user from his forums for asking when the game will be updated again. This is his professional ban message he leaves them with: ""Get ♥♥♥♥ed, I don't owe you anything."" ----EDIT:Basically in his other comments he's made in my review (besides the response he left at the bottom of my review) he complains that the things that I say are bad about this game he cannot fix, and that I don't complain about enough; or really any architectural features about the game itself. Honestly the community for this game is so hostile and disfunctional (which is what this review tried to originally describe) and when you put that on top of the fact that the game has not been updated in over a year and is managed very poorly I personally have come to the conclusion that this game is not worth spending your time and money on. That is the point I was trying to make.To talk about the actual gameplay of this game and it's features:The game features a menu where you can select what brick you want and place it ontop of another brick, to build virtually whatever you want. This, along with a minigame creator where you can choose to spawn with weapons and start a deathmatch with other players. Now that there isn't maps anymore I have basically listed all of the features of this game.There has been ONE new / neat thing that was added into the game since the games actual realse by the developer himself . And this was actually really pretty cool (when it came out in 2010) where you can ""wrench"" bricks to name them, spawn weapons on them and (the new part) ""event"" them to where you can setup conditional events to make them check for / do certian things (like explode, play a sound, emit an particle, ect.) when you activate them (or when something does). Other than this however (and keep in mind this came out in 2010) there has been nothing new that has been added into the game through an update in the complete history of this games existance. (besides the removal of maps and addition of very poorly optimized shaders - which was hardly an update, if you ask anyone in the community)CAN you build things in this game? Sure you can! I've built castles, houses, all that stuff... But it takes a lot of time to learn how. It's not easy to do. And you're not going to be getting help along the way, as the hostile commuinty doesn't put up with people who have questions, or can't manage things on their own. So if you want to, yes you can - but you're going to have to learn all by yourself and it takes a lot of time before you will get to making anything even half as spectacular as what's shown in the trailer. It's just really a lot more complicated and a lot less convenient than he makes it out to be. After playing the game and building things in it for seven years the way he is advertising it (quite frankly) seems like some sort of trick - atleast to me. The game doesn't have all that stuff in it currently and all of that would be extremely hard to make on your own. There arent't currently servers like that ready where all of that stuff you saw in that trailer will be waiting for you. You CAN make all of those things that are in the trailer, to be fair. However, just no one really does. So to put it clearly, I just don't get the point. Why show a trailer of your game that is not like your game at all / full of things that aren't currently in your game?TO CONCLUDE: The gameplay of this game is NOT bad. It is just a game that hasn't been updated in forever, and is managed very poorly. If you are looking for a game with a future, that has planned updates, friendly technical support or that has a community full of users that you will enjoy to play the game with, DONT buy this game - because well, it has none of these things.

												Why do I have only 0.2 hours played? I did not buy the game through Steam and do not wish to play the game through Steam, so I have run the game for the minimum 10 minutes to be able to post a review.Perhaps the simplest way to describe this game is with one image that describes the lack of development as well as intolerance of criticism by the developer regarding the game's development and outright punishment of his criticizers. In fact, the developer has pre-emptively banned me from Steam's forum for this game.The developer's current response to this review is literally just a quick one-line dismissal as if playing the game for a long time precludes me from talking negatively about it and then he makes a sales pitch.The developer has finally admitted that he has stopped all development[forum.blockland.us] on the game, as if it hadn't been already obvious considering the lack of updates in the past ten months (no longer true), the half-broken Steam version of the game (broken for a year already), and the extremely low quality and quantity of the updates before then. He has resorted to censoring and banning people who criticize the game's development[blocklandcloud.com], so this should be an obvious sign that the game is done for. When or if you buy this abandoned game, consider the fact that this disrespectful, uncaring and greedy ""developer"" will be getting your money.========Response to developer response (10 August 2014):++++++++++(original developer response)""Hey everyone, right now Blockland is available in the Reboot 6.0 bundle from BundleStars: http://www.bundlestars.com/all-bundles/reboot-bundle-6/6 great Steam games (including Blockland!) for only $2.99!Why not pick it up, play Blockland for 5 years, then leave a negative Steam review?See you back here in 2019!""++++++++++How nice of you to finally respond to one of the most thorough and drama-free reviews once it reached the front page! Oh wait, that's not really a response... it's a sales promotion. A sales promotion is definitely a valid response to everything I've already written here!Believe it or not, it is quite possible to love the art but hate the artist. As a modder myself, I've dealt with years of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when it came to supporting modders and their needs. I had been running a hosting service for quite some time until the day I left, which is one of the biggest reasons I stayed so long. Unfortunately, you decided to take a ""♥♥♥♥ it"" approach when it came to supporting server hosting services (and modders), so now the game's largest two hosting services are gone and the community is left with almost nothing. You have banned users from your forum for criticizing the game, so once I finally had enough of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I left the game. Since you have no power here to permanently delete people's opinions, which you do at your own forum (evidence of this is in the very next segment of this review), this was the perfect chance to finally speak my mind without fearing all the possible consequences with which you could punish me. Considering that this review is now the top review, I think it's reasonable to say that people have had enough of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, too.It's not like I suddenly started hating the game. While I was still a part of the community, I felt as if I couldn't speak my mind since you punish everyone who criticizes it. I was able to realize my power to reach out to people once I was free from your reigns, so I exerted that power. This isn't some campaign of revenge: it's years of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t finally brought to light.========Update (6 August 2014):The owner of the game (Badspot) has silently banned ""Heedicalking"" from the game's official forum. Heedicalking is an important person in terms of the servers he hosted and his contributions to the community. Heedicalking often talks about the lack of game development on the forum in the most mature way possible. Development has in fact been lacking recently: in fact, there hasn't been a major update in the last 2 years. Many people were expecting him to be banned for simply criticizing the game's development, and voilà, he has finally been banned. The owner of the game is getting extremely defensive towards anyone who dares talk about the game's lack of development.For reference, here are relevant links pertaining to the post removals:http://blocklandcloud.com/heed/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54466069/banned.png========Update (27 June 2014):The owner of the game (Badspot) has banned LewnaJa and me from Blockland's Steam community. He also deleted the entire thread in which he had our responses. The thread (the poster was most likely not the victim) was pointing out how a ban was unfair. The same ban image also happened to be mentioned in an earlier review from February: http://steamcommunity.com//profiles/76561198044732390/recommended/250340/Here is copy of thread: http://blocklandcloud.com/20140626-blockland-steam-removed-thread/The ban reasons for us are the same and the posts cited for our bans were each of our first ones in that thread. This is LewnaJa's ban:http://imgur.com/a/oX0exThe owner has taken similar action towards LewnaJa when he initially posted his negative review and found himself banned from the game's official forum (not Steam's forum provided for the game).Make your own conclusions about why the owner of the game felt so obliged to ban us. Today, the negative reviews have been piling up on the store page to the point where 3 of the 5 shown-to-everyone-by-default reviews were negative and it still remains that way. Fortunately he does not have the power to remove any reviews at all. It must be embarrassing for Badspot to have what is pretty much the front page for his game be covered in negativity.========Original review:I have played this game for more than 5 years (not on Steam) and I am disappointed at how quickly it has declined. Don't be fooled into buying this game just because it looks great. The developers (developer) have abandoned the game. Check out my long elaboration on why I think the game is practically abandoned:http://www.reddit.com/r/BlocklandIsHorrible/comments/267v7h/badspot_is_no_longer_doing_his_fair_share_of_work/The game hasn't had a major update for 2 years and any update for 6 months. The game's most important people have been angry about the developer's (""Badspot"") reluctance to maintain the game's development. Check out this satirical comic which illustrates the developer's greed: http://brockrandcomics.tumblr.com/post/92596058472/filipe-7-22-14CLARIFICATION FOR BELOW PARAGRAPH: server hosting issues do not include those who have bought the game in the classical way and duplicated their purchases to their Steam accounts, because they can still run the game the classical way. The below paragraph applies to those who have exclusively bought the game from Steam and not on the Blockland website.If you buy Blockland through Steam, you will have a lot of trouble hosting a server. Although there is technically a way to host a server by modifying the program's arguments, you can't play the game at the same time. Want someone else to circumvent these restrictions by hosting a server for you under your name? Too bad; hosting services cannot be used by people who bought the game through Steam. The developers have neglected Steam users and deprived them of server hosting for over 6 months. I think it's clear that they do not care anymore and are only trying to make a quick buck out of what the game has left.(THIS HAS BEEN AN OUTSTANDING ISSUE FOR OVER A YEAR)Some of you legacy players may find these statistics about the game's decline interesting: http://blocklandcloud.com/ "

												[If you dislike reading seemingly irrelevant information you are free to skip to the bottom of this review. There you will find my recommendation. Thank you!]So this game has been one of my favorite building games of all time. Starting in 2010 along with the majority of what I would say was our community, I bought the original Blockland and was having a great time. Things were getting done, updates being made. There were these classics maps I'll never forget: the Bedroom, the Kitchen, and the Slopes. I enjoyed this game, and I was estimated to be playing it about 10 hours a day or more. (Update: Many people don't believe I played this game as long as I claim. The truth is, Blockland existed before (its release on) Steam. For this reason, Steam has not registered all my hours from when I played it before. I only recently migrated to Steam Blockland from the original Vanilla Blockland. Hope that clears things up!)It took some time but an insightful man by the name of Ephialtes in-game decided to build Blockland a new system. I believe it was around 2011-2012 that this became widely-used. It was called Return to Blockland, and was basically the Steam client for Blockland before Blockland was actually on Steam. It had a 'Workshop' (servers that hosted add-ons you could directly download from), Add-On Manager, Friends client, global IRC chat, chat rooms, easy-to-use settings system for your server, add-on preferences manager, and so much more. It was the true revelation of Blockland's existence. It brought upon a new experience for the Blockland community, and gave it a modern feel.Then this game went on Greenlight.That officially marked the downfall of RTB, which would eventually be shut down because Steam replaced 1/3 of its functionality. There would no longer be a place to manage your add-ons, chat globally with other BL users, find your friends (since they would no longer be on RTB and you didn't know if they had Steam), and last but not least, you could no longer manage your server like you used to.That probably drove me away the most. I stuck around for a bit, hosted a multitude of mildly popular servers as well as a 32/32 player MERP server that consisted of most of my time. After about four months, I kinda lost interest and began the process of leaving the BL community. I left a legacy, but even that would soon be forgotten...So you know that game called Minecraft? I ended up spending almost all of my time on that. I hosted some very popular servers on Minecraft, met some great friends, and was enjoying it. I almost forgot about Blockland completely, but then my friend (who shall remain nameless) decided to get Blockland after I showed him a fun little gamemode on it called Renderman. He got it, and when I saw that he did, I decided to hop back on and play with him... but I didn't do much otherwise.I truly came back about two months ago. I began hosting my MERP server, probably just to feel the nostalgia and see all the empires that had been built on it. A friend of mine by the name of Amir (a full-time player of my server back when it was popular) happened to stop by. We had an awesome reunion, played a bit of MERP (not really. Just remarked on how sucky our builds were), had a lot of fun. I began playing Blockland much more.And then I stopped. Garry's Mod took up my time. I managed a community on there and couldn't depart from them. But that wasn't the only reason.I lost interest.So anyways, if you got to the bottom of this review reading through an incredibly long backstory and wondering why the heck I'd write a story like that, I congratulate you. You have the patience of a... you, but none of this was really a review, was it?So here's my take on the game.If you want to play a game with a large amount of active community supporters/respectful, mature players, don't get this game.If you want to play a game where you build anything and can do anything (with the help of a bit of programming knowledge or the visually-based event system), get this game.If you want to play a game where servers are always full and there is an easy way to liven up your game with user-created add-ons, don't get this game.If you want to play a game where you can host a server of any kind, have some fun with Pirate Ship DM gamemodes, and basically shoot your friends with laser pistols and horse rays (yeah, they turn them into a horse), this game IS FOR YOU.BUT. If you want a game that will keep you interested for years to come, always ready for that next update, always ready for that next big thing... don't get this game. It's unkempt, uncombed, and unfathomably stagnate.But I might be wrong. What if YOU are the next big thing?In my opinion, this game is NOT recommended due to the lack of interesting things that may be found in Blockland. It's a great game, don't get me wrong, but it is running on steam (get it hahahahaaha... haha. ..ha... sorry) and no longer has that spark of a game that has true potential. Maybe Badspot can turn this around one day. And maybe you can be a part of that. Me, on the other hand, have exhausted the game of Blockland. I like the game, but I can no longer play it.Maybe it'll be different for you.			"

												I've probably put over 1500 hours into this before it came to steam.This is one of the best games I have ever played. It's limitlessly open, with a great mature (edit 4 months later: kind of mature, it's a lego game, of course it'll attract kids.) community, and there's just so much to experience, from dogfights, to city RPGs, to gangster shootouts, to go-kart races, to who-knows-what! There's thousands upon thousands of addons (plugins/mods) for the game that are extremely easy to install and the game is still going strong since it's initial build in 2004!Buy this game!Buy it!Buy it now!

												Okay. What i'm about to tell you actually ♥♥♥♥ing happened.I joined an rp server with 15 people. At first i was confused, and went around being a general knob, stealing cars, sitting on people, ect. Somehow i didnt get banned for fail RP. After about an hour of observing these people mingle around, I decided to join in. I sat with them as they put some dude on trial for some reason. Then, everyone got in a treehouse and there was lava and blah blah blah it was interesting, but this isnt the best part. So, after this, everyone started to properly RP. People went to their houses, got their cars, ect. Intrigued by this, I decided to stalk an unsuspecting household and observe everyday life in Blockland. Soon enough, they relised i was watching them, and they dubbed me 'the stalker under the porch' and 'the creepy guy by the window'. I stood around, holding a bunny doll and staring motionlessly in at them. After a while, I managed to get into their house. I stayed low, and snuck around, eating their pizza. Soon enough though, they found me. I retreated into a corner, under their stairs. And they locked me in. Kept me as their pet. I couldnt escape, i couldnt move, i couldnt run. But they fed me and talked to me, and I gave up hope on ever getting out. After a while they got bored and buggered off (they let me out after some persuasion though). After another hour of building my own ♥♥♥♥♥♥ yellow house, i returned to their house, and they welcomed me in this time. They let me use their toilet, watch tv, and partay all night. Some rocket launcher spammers came along but they were soon banned, and the partay carried on. At one point, they embedded me into some concrete like Han Solo in Star Wars. But they let me out eventually. They were cool people, and thats rare to find in a game. And then, some guy came along and told me to follow him. So i followed him, and he led me to his house. He told me to be a baby.  I was confused at first, but then he locked the doors, somehow shrunk me, and made me crawl around, typing baby noises in chat, and chilling in a crib he made. It was ♥♥♥♥ing scary. And i really couldnt escape. After a while he took me to town in his car. I could only crawl around the place, so i happily accepted the transport away from that guys creepy ♥♥♥ house. Now i just needed to lose this guy (without failing rp). The guy crashed the car, and i snuck off, claiming i was a scared and confused baby. Thats where everything went to ♥♥♥♥. I engaged operation 'Grand Theft Baby', stole a car, a gun, and as my baby self, i hit the road. This pedo guy tried looking for me with his jetpack, but i hit the hills and quietly disconected from the game. This was one ♥♥♥♥ing server. I spent 4 hours on 1 ♥♥♥♥ing server having the creepiest yet most fun time of my life. Not to mention the fact that i went insane from the fact that the house i was stalking had some wierd radio playing a song about tacos on repeat. (at one point it glitched out and amplified like 100 times; my ears bled...)This was ONE ♥♥♥♥ing server. There are other great servers, such as the battlefield-esque dogfighting server, or the knife TDM server. This game is absolutley incredible. Not to mention the incredible options for creativity and modding in single player (addons galore!), and the wonderful destruction physics!This game is a must have if you like RP, multiplayer games in general and creative games. Its incredible fun, i played 9 ♥♥♥♥ing hours on my first day of owning it. I love Blockland, and though it may be dying player wise, its still one hell of a time!Its like Lego, Gmod and Roblox had a baby!Oh yeah, and, for whatever ♥♥♥♥ing reason, you can get an achivment called 'gay pirate' for wearing a pink pirate hat. WTF!?10/10 IGNNo seriously, like 8/10 (its buggy, its dying, but as i said, its a hell of a time!)			"

												The vanilla game may not have a ton to offer, so it all comes down to what the community has to offer (which is a ton). The gameplay makes it a lot like Gmod, except with a more consistant style. Additionally, it's multiplayer architecture makes joining servers with custom content seamless. You'll literally never need to actually install an add-on to play on a server with custom content (with a few exceptions, servers using custom GUI's may want you to install their GUI mods in order to play. This is usually optional anyways.) The gamemode system adds a lot more 'out of the box' fun things to do than the game used to have. But it's still a bit underwhelming and you'll probably only get about a few hours of fun out of it if you refuse to install any add-on gamemodes or other things. Other than a few gamemodes available that are designed to be played in single-player, multiplayer is really where everything is at. There are a number of servers that have been developed for literally years and have a very high quality experience. If you ever really enjoyed Gmod at all, you'll probably find that the most fun servers in Blockland are ones where someone has simply set out a blank slate and a bunch of really neat mods. Shenanigans ensue.It's a game you'll just keep coming back to.Edit: a.			"

												Just noticed that rust is in the list of similar gamesGET THIS ♥♥♥♥*edit*Fixed ""Recoomended"" errorto People saying if I have over 100 hours why don't I reccomend it, Read the first line of the paragraph!While I love this game to death I can't really recomend it, being the community of uncreative rp ruining ♥♥♥♥♥♥, gun spammers, and just horrible little kids, I have met alot of nice people on this game including a few of my best friends on steam, since rtb shut down getting addons isnt as easy as it used to be, and without addons this game is very limiting, even the trailer is full of addons! , another thing I hated is when they removed maps and replaced them with shaders that less than half the community can run because how poorly optimized it is, over all I still really like this game, it's really fun to get a bunch of friends and build stuff, please don't dislike this review just because it's not your opinion!

												The first online game I ever played. Don't let my measly 120 hours fool you; before this got on Steam, I'd spend so many days after school just playing this, messing around with friends and creating memories that genuinely fill me with tears of joy as I think back on them today.Since I started back in 2009, I've been building, shooting, making videos, mining, and just generally messing around with the multitudes of crazy add-ons that have made the game what it is today. It's definitely not as alive as it used to be, but for what it is now, it's well worth ten bucks. I paid 20 bucks for it and it basically got me to where I am today, shaping my interests and online presence. I've certainly had a blast.			"

												Blockland used to be one of my Favourite games, There were fun map with hidden secrets, The bedroom, The slopes and The kitchen, and you could always get add-ons with  RTB (Return to blockland), an amazing site for finding cool mods. However, Things changed.First of all, Actual maps were removed and only a flat baseplate was left standing. Although there's still structures that you can load up, they're simply no-where near as good as the original maps. This Meant that MP servers were now boring, as most modded gamemodes can't be played. I won't say that the community was ever perfect, it used to be good, but now RTB is abandoned and Blockland servers are basically empty shells of what they used to be. There's also the fact that the blocks that can be used to build are practically LEGO Blocks, which means that even building simple square houses is a tedious process. Overall, Blockland is a true gem lost in time, what used to be a thriving gaming community has become a desolate wasteland and has fallen prey to Money-Hog Developers that can't be bothered to fix their already ruined game.3/10 would not have One of my favourite games ruined again.

												Blockland is my favorite game, and is has been since 2008. The community is creative, and there's hundreds of servers to explore 24/7. Building is a joy, TDMs are responsive, quick, and fun, and exploring other people's servers will keep you entertained for a lifetime. I certainly recommend this game, and so does pretty much everyone I know that has it.			"

												The game is about building anything you can imagine, it's a non-linear sandbox game in which the world is your canvas. Literally a blank canvas.I've played this game since it was in vers. 8. I had the time of my life playing on all the deathmatch and freebuild servers and whatnot.When I discovered addons and mods, I was amazed. People made all sorts of new vehicles, bricks, weapons etc. for the game. I decided I'd download some and try them out.The one addon/mod I really enjoyed was Gamemode_Zombie. It was a L4D-style addon with all the zombie types (boomer, hunter, etc.) There was even a subway map made for it.Now, there was this sort of client within the game called Return to Blockland (RTB). It included a friends list and an addon manager and even a public chat thing where you could talk to anyone that had RTB. It was overall just a neat way to chat with friends and find new addons.But the game has taken a turn for the worse, I am afraid. Not too long ago, RTB was shut down. The friend system was no longer available and the mod downloader/manager was shut down as well. It was much harder to contact friends and see what addons were installed on your game. This made many people upset and the game just sort of died.The game itself, though, had a decent amount of content. There were maps such as Kitchen, The Slopes, and Bedroom that you could explore. Now, these maps weren't made of bricks so that's what made them unique.The V21 update changed this. Maps were replaced by nicer graphics and better shaders,and to make up for the loss of maps we were given an empty slate to build on. The ground and skybox were, or /are/ customizeable with different textures and whatnot.The loss of RTB and the maps has just led to the downfall of this game. The community has turned in to some sort of mix of a Tumblr/♥♥♥♥♥ drama-fest full of feels and oppression where everyone thinks they can flame and argue with each other to solve their problems.I haven't played this game for about 2-3 months because there just isn't anything new or exciting to see and do and, as i stated in the previous paragraph, the community is just downright bad. The servers are low-quality with 99.9% of them being horrid Five Nights at Freddy's RPs and that last .1% being an actual good server with decent admins and choice of addons. (which honestly is hard to find, you should be happy if you actually manage to find or make one.)I can't exactly recommend this game. Once it gets better (which it clearly never will), then maybe I'll change my review.maybe.I give this game a 3/10.TL;DR-------The game was good up until v21.-Maps were awesome and now we just have a blank slate.-There was a good community with a good amount of content.-RTB closed down and everything went bad, especially the community.-FNAF fanboys.-tumblr party-RIP, Blockland.-3/10sorry for the novel of a review.

												-PLEASE READ ALL COMMENTS BELOW-August 8th: Badspot snaps and admits the development is screwed:http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=264261.msg7762181#msg7762181Edit of August 8th: Removed some old data to make room for new dataPlease visit http://www.reddit.com/r/BlocklandIsHorrible after reading this review.""http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?&topic=256488.msg7466927#msg7466927Check out how the guy who made this game describes in detail why he encourages ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ behavior."" - AmadiohaEdit of March 22nd: Someone has made a claim that Badspot has attempted to hire them to gather my personal information -- like home address, work place if applicable, and other things. He also claims that he would have gotten this information through sending me viruses. I worry about the reasoning behind his desire for my personal information.Given that this kind of activity is illegal, I have sent Badspot an email regarding this situation and am currently awaiting his response and see whether or not he denies the accusations. Since the ""hacker"" gave me the information, I have nothing against him and don't plan to take any action against him. I am posting this update because he is ignoring my emails, making him even more suspicious.Edit of March 11th, in response to the developer's desperate attempt at defending himself after making himself look like a clown:Before judging me as a person, please read how the users of Blockland reacted to a disliked user's house being burned down and his cat being killed: http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=181239.0Please ignore the developer's response for now. If you want to know why he is resorting to such low tactics to defend himself, I insist that you read all of the comments below on all pages. I will address the developer's response directly from the comments in order to save space on this review and to prevent people from reading my life story when the review is about Blockland.Edit of March 6th, in response to the developer editing his response in effort to work around his original comment's deletion which was intended to harass me:Eric Hartman (Badspot), has a history of being childish in the way he handles things. He has let children upset him to the point of exposing their personal information and families' information over the internet in an effort to have his community harass them in his defense.While there is only one case that I know of where this has occurred, it is unacceptable and is a violation of that person's privacy rights. Badspot revealed the payment names and email addresses of this user which, I'm pretty sure, is against the law.Here is the ""Drama Dossier"" on a user who has made the mistake of upsetting Badspot: http://badspot.us/Zac-Conover.htmlALL of his communication data which was collected by Badspot through SECURE PAYMENTS and was trusted to him, a man selling his product. How can you explain that? You give a man selling a legitimate product your money and he exposes the information you used on his website because you angered him. Does that sound professional to you? I think not.The question you should be asking yourselves is: Do you want to end up like this guy? If you bother Badspot enough, he'll do the same to you. I have hardly done anything worth being called out for because this man has ignored my existence until the very moment I called him out on the one place he still has a chance to milk money from users with a game he doesn't even take care of.-Edit of February 25th, removed for updated data----- Original Review ----I'll be the first to write a somewhat negative review about this game:First: I started playing this game around 2006-07, prior to Retail Blockland's (the current game) release. This game is almost entirely community-based. This game is what you want to make it, which means the community needs responsible, creative users to help form a fun game for everyone.This has been a problem since the recent removal of maps, which were an easy way to play the game without putting too much effort into it. Currently, the game has a lack of creative players which have caused many, many players to quit the game due to the lack of content from the developer (which he removed maps with a promise of more content, which never came, even a year later), and the lack of decent servers to play on.However, Blockland has always had the problem of a small community which has made decent servers scarce. The lack of maps has left mapmakers without their ability to contribute to Blockland, causing them to leave along with many other players who enjoyed playing on maps rather than the default (and now, the only) map, ""Slate"".I'm not going to lie. I, and many others have felt that the game has been dead (or dying) for a long time now. Even when maps were still here, the game was dying slowly, but surely -- the removal of the maps just kickstarted it because nobody knew how to cope with the lack of creative builders to replace the position that maps once held.Steam, for some of us, is believed to be the last resort for Blockland's future. It's up to you, the newest purchaser who is reading this review, to help reform the community into something better, more active, and more stable.Another problem is that since the maps were removed, many players with low-spec computers were forced to quit due to being unable to process the amount of bricks it would take to create a ""map"".So, if you've got a low-spec PC, I would not recommend this game to you until you get a computer with a decent processor and graphics card. Otherwise, you'll be playing with a constant lag that will drive you to hate the game.The shaders are poorly optimized. (And I mean, they are *extremely* poorly optimized.) So the majority of the Blockland community don't even play with the shaders that we sacrificed our maps for because they can't even run them. Not even high-spec computers can run the shaders with a large amount of bricks unless you've got a ridiculously powerful computer. I've got a quad-core i5 processor and an AMD 7870 Graphics card, 2GB video memory, and I can run Battlefield 3 on max settings with over 60FPS, whereas I have trouble running shaders on max in Blockland and end up only getting around 28-30FPS with builds that are around 50k bricks or more.The gameplay is good as long as you play on a decent server, it depends on your tastes.I'm also going to warn anyone who buys this game: Prepare to be flamed, trolled, or annoyed by the community at some point. The game has one of the most merciless, rude, arrogant communities I have ever been a part of. However, that's not the majority of the community. A lot of the community is very nice and like to take part with each other in building projects or film-making and such. But if you ask me, the community needs an increase in better players.To conclude, we have a lack of a decent, creative playerbase right now and we need more players with more creativity and will to step forward and create something awesome out of this game. Everything in the trailer IS possible, but most of it has never happened and will never happen unless we have more creative players. The trailer was highly exaggerated and the game is far more boring than that. But like I said, everything in the trailer is possible, but it hasn't happened -- yet.So, if you're willing to be a good player and you want to help revive an almost-dead game and form it into a better game for everyone's enjoyment, buy the game. If you don't want to work with the community, hate playing games that take time and effort to make something good out of it, or just generally dislike overhyped games, don't buy it. Even though the game is overexaggerated, it doesn't mean we can't work together to make it that awesome.It's up to you.			"

												I got into Blockland back in 2005 when I was just 11 years old, and back then it was a free game that looked just like Legos, and ever since then, I've seen people and friends come and go, rivalries with other games that were only similar in the concept of 'sandbox game where you can build and destroy anything'.As someone who had practically no social interaction prior, this game and it's community actually helped me grow and mature as a person, I've met so many cool, intelligent, talented and funny people over the years and even became friends with some of them, and it got me in to basic C++ scripting, 3D modeling, audio editing, and even a bit of video making. It is at this point that I feel like I owe my life to this game. Even to this day, I find myself coming back to this game every now and then to build something, to create a new mod, try out someone else's mod, or to just goof about on servers.This game, for me, and several others, is like the 'Hotel California' of video games, you may leave, you may stop playing for a while, but you always come back, for one reason or another. Even those who don't like this game or it's community and get banned for their actions keep spending more of their money just to come back, it's like a drug that you just can't quit!For the 11 years I've been at this game, I've been very active on the message boards, and it's been such an interesting, funny, and unique community over the years, and I've been able to watch it grow and change as time went on, like, I've never been so invested in a community as I am with Blockland's.I do hope that Blockland becomes as popular as games like Roblox, some may disagree with me on this, that they prefer this smaller and more controlled crowd of people, but Blockland really does deserves a bigger audience, it actually is a fun and amazing game. It may be slow and tedious to build something big and amazing, but that's how building is with every sandbox game, ""Rome wasn't built in a day."", and if building isn't your thing, there's just a big variety of gamemodes and servers out there that are PvP death-matches, role playing servers, a boss battle server, knife fights in the sky with grappling hooks, dog fights, single-lap races, multi-lap races-- there's just so many to choose from, you're bound to find something you like!The biggest problem with the game is 'time', what time of the day you get on matters, what time-zone you live in compared to other people matters, what day of the week it is matters, time is a big factor in finding busy and/or good quality servers.While I recommend this game, I also commend checking out the message boards, there you can chillax and talk amongst others that play the game, get help with the game, post pictures of things you built or did, download add-ons or other sorts of mods that people make, or just talk about whatever else, about other video games, or about drawings or other sorts of creative things you or other people do!

												I played this game back when it wasn't on Steam, I was one of those annoying five-years-olds who destroyed other people's stuff. I had a one month membership on this game, and I played it non-stop (most likely over 200 hours total) for the short time I had it. After I ran out of the membership, I went to Roblox (bad idea, big war going on between Blockland and Roblox at that time). After I quit Roblox, I went to Minecraft. Then I (semi)quit Minecraft and went to Steam. After about two years on Steam, I found this game. I had wonderful flashbacks of how me and my cousin would destroy everything, and build it again, then destroy it, again and again and again. My previously mentioned cousin actually bought this game for me (props to you, my friend!) on steam and we played. Although a lot changed, almost to the point where I couldn't recognize it, I still had fun. The new maps were fun, the old maps were still fun, and the whole game had been transformed into a world of small communities and close friends. This is one of my favorite games right now, and I recommend it for my own story, but you should buy this game so you can make your own story, and in a few years, when you are a pro at Blockland, look back at this review and make your own. I know that sounds really cheesy, but seriously, we need to have fun with our games and tell the amazing times and adventures that we have in those games to show people why they should create their own. So, buy this game, right now. Make your own story. Make your own review. Do what I have done, tell others to do so. This is the perfect game for it, so much to do, so much to see. So, what are you waiting for, do it!			"

												The game has unbelievably good gameplay mechanics, and quality, The game also has horrific gameplay mechanics, and quality. The main reason I say that is because of the community.The community is this horrific machine, that says ""Made in America"" on the back, because it's a loud, clunking Chevrolet slowly killing itself as it tries to operate. The entire game is ran be any player with a BL ID (Number you're assigned to, to recognize yourself in-game) that is under  9999. Nowadays, Blockland has around 180000 Players, therefor 180000 BL IDs. Blockland is this nasty 90's High School Cafeteria, and the Forums are the restrooms where people smoke. It has vicious cliques that don't get along with eachother, from the horny teenage anime fans to the eight-year-old FNaF CoD fans. In the game, there are around 40 players that are extremely popular, for no good reason. These people are disquisting little chihuahuas that shake about all day, picking on others. I understand I come across as a six year old when I say this, but Blockland truely is the land of Cyber Bullies. Expecially if you buy the game, for one reason and one reason only - Your BL ID. Blockland is like America, where one batch of immigrants hates the newer ones. Buying the game, for the first 2 days or so, withen buying it, you're the newest player, and everyone can see that. I have seen shiny brand new players permanantly banned for being new. So with this2/10, maybe 3 at it's best. Two years ago.			"

												Played since 2008, was a great game. (GAME FULL OF KIDS, LIKE SERIOUSLY.)The loss of players and the lack of creators updates left it a partly-unfinished game leaving the community to mod their own gamemodes on their own. Yet ruining the game; Not a single update went out until last year, and yet as he says, he declares no more.IF you buy this game, you wont get a whoop load of fantastic fun like you would back in 2009, the forum is nearly dead and the gamestyle is old, I promise it will be a bad experience and a waste of money; He's practically using it to leech his ten bucks every week. Making more SH**TY games, and he wont focus on one large project.Return-To-Blockland began to stop using their free merchandise on blockland, because one of the lucky men keeping it alive was rewarded a promotion elsewere. Ruining the game even more it has less stinctive use and predictament to the game. Since then, thankful for all the modders and their helpful work.

												This game is a good game IF: You put in the time to learn it.  I have put about 5 months into this game outside of steam, and I still love it.  I feel like I can get more out of it the more I play it.I am going to address most of the things the negative reviews are saying about this game. 1.  Minecraft is betterIn this game it is hard to build things that look good, but you can make things in much greater detail than in minecraft.  The building in this game is superior to minecraft's building.  You can build things with dozens of different bricks (not including brick mods) unlike minecraft that just has a standard block with different textures and a few other detail blocks like fences.  Minecraft has a terrible combat system that makes it awful for mini games.  This game has amazing combat elements.  You can do anything in this game in minecraft, but not nearly as well or easily.  Minecraft combat and minigames feel cheap and not very well put together.  I personally hate minecraft, but that does not make it a bad game.     It is a good survival sandbox game, but it ends there.  Anything above that can be done better in so many other games.2.  The developer is awfulWho cares, you are buying the game not the developer.  If you are not on the forums and arn't stealing anyones keys or doing something that would get you banned from any other multiplayer game on steam, you will be fine.  I have never had a problem with the developer at any time.3.  The community is awfulI really have not noticed this outside of the forums, and even so, it is mostly the drama section of the forums that is awful.  It depends on the server you go on of course, but the whole community is not awful.  The bad community in this game consists of the ones that keep complaining about how terrible the developer and community is.  I don't see them doing anything to make it better, they just tick off the developer with their constant complaining which I find makes me angry as well.  I don't even deal with a hundreth as much as the developer does, so excuse him for for being cranky sometimes.If you look for terrible people in a community you will find terrible people in a community.  If you look for awesome people in a community you will find awesome people in a community.4.  Not enough content/game is dyingNot true.  Since this game has been on steam only over a year at the time of this review, the community has more than trippled.  Dying? ok sure.  More people means more mods and servers.  Mods are so easy to install in this game, and it is the only game that I do not find it to be a hassel to do so.  People have modded the game so heavily that it does not even feel like the same game anymore.  This game is fairly dependant on mods, but it has some VERY good mods.5.  Terrain/interriors replaced with shaders and it ruined the gameTerrain and interriors were not all that great.  Like really they were ok for a few servers, but I only used the flat maps and built my own terrain.  They simply were not easy to build on in many cases which happens to be one of the main points of the game.  The shadows and shaders look amazing and are also moddable.  Even if you cannot run them, it does not take away from the game.  There is an environment editing GUI that allows you to edit the lighting, weather, fog, ground texture/color, water level, and other things.  One of the most used maps before the removal of terrain was adjustable plate which was the same thing as the environment edit GUI but not as good.And finally...This game is great if you put the time in to learn it and have friends to play with.  Most of the time I have put into this game I have played without friends, so they are not required to have fun.  There are times when there are not many interesting servers to join, but even then you can just host your own.  Don't listen to those complaining about the community and the dev.  If you like building and or a casual FPS I would highly recommend this game.  There have been times when I did not build for months playing this game, and I just enjoyed the fighting/shooter servers.			"

												I have a sub 800 Blockland ID, not that anyone really cares but I've been with this game for a while. There once was a time I would have suggested this game over Roblox or Minecraft any day of the week, but these days Blockland is so stagnant and pointless with a developer that seems to have just given up and yells at anybody who argues with him that it's just not worth playing anymore. Ever since they removed maps, one of the most memorable parts of this game, all the game has had are 'bug fixes' and a few lighting updates. And that was.. years ago... The building aspect is still there, but it's almost not fun anymore when you can't make a diving board on the top of a house with 50 secret entrances			"

												A great game with endless possibilities. Based on the LEGO system, but so much more than basic building, not only can you build anything you can imagine, but you can also add events like team Deathmatch themed for tons of games like TF2, CoD, and Battlefield, and much more. You can race in a realistic style race or you can set up a Mario Kart style race. Those are just a few examples of the versatility of this game. Also you can make your builds interactive, with lights/emitters to make your builds look great. Blockland is a game anyone who likes to be creative should try.			"

Played since 2007, even before the Steam Greenlight migration happened. Basically, I grew up with this game. I met some good friends in the community. It was good. I'm not sure up until now since the new visual features were added, but still a good game in its core. I've spent a ♥♥♥♥♥on of hours on this game ever since. Now, I think I've grown up from this game, but I think new people can appreciate it as well.RTB (Return to Blockland) was game's greatest community mod API ever. Unfortunately, it was shut down by its creator Ephialtes, due to a majority of its functionality was overrun by Steam's community tools. It's sad, because a majority of good, curated add-ons were on its database. I just hope Badspot (the developer) finds a way to introduce the Steam Workshop to Blockland in order to compensate this.The downside to add-ons recently is that all add-ons are not curated anymore, just scanned for malicious or too-crappy code/content. Nonetheless, some high quality add-ons still exist in the community forums.Disclaimer though,A high percentage of the community is difficult to manage with (considering most are kids at the moment). This can be avoided if you have a lot of patience in communicating with children.Again, due to the most of the community being children, banning was a common act of the developer. There were as well, older people who are apparently trolls who love to spark the fire in the community. Some are it for fun, while some are it for revenge. This is the reason why some people are angry at the developer for cleansing the community of many people.Only a fraction are those excellent to play with and communicate with. Occasionally, you will find a fraction of this community on some servers.			"

												     Before we even get started, some people might say ""Oh, this looks like a Minecraft copy."" but that is incorrect, as it was around way before Minecraft was even thought up of. It's not like Roblox either (Ah the famous Blockland vs Roblox wars...) because of the more solid platform and no subscription. So what is this then? Good question. I think Badspot, the creator of the game, can sum it up quite nicely:""Blockland is an online multiplayer game where you build things with bricks.It's like playing with legos on the internet.""     In my mind, Blockland is one of the best construction/building sandbox games ever made. It is one of my personal favorites that I've played since 2007. I probably have over 600 hours ingame. (Not including Steam) You can do just about anything in this game, from FPS Team Deathmatches to racing to <variable>. Blockland is quite fun by itself, but the real reason you get it is for the high modability. Thousands of community creations keep the game interesting, and populated. Vehicles, weapons, gamemodes, scripts, events, this game has it all for customization. While singleplayer lets you experiment and test, multiplayer is where most people will choose to spend their time. There is always a server up for a specific type of play. (And they usually have good admins)     There is one part where Blockland has an issue...The community is not amazing. (Most of the modders are amazing though) If you go on the official forums you will most likely see tons of hate/spam/garbage/negativity. The moderators do a good job of clearing out the useless and hurtful stuff, but I feel as if its always been like this. If you are like me, you really don't let it get to you; but I can see how it might be unacceptable to others.     Other than this (really) small issue, I completely and fully recommend Blockland to anybody that is even slightly interested in sandbox games or being creative.10/10			"

												I think a lot of the reviews compared it what it used to be. However, I got it pretty recently (within the past 3 months) and I think it's pretty good. The building and overall gameplay took me a while to get used to it, but it plays fairly easily after that. The building system is a bit annoying, but you get used to it. The game modes are pretty good, but most of them are optimized for multiplayer. Speaking of multiplayer, the overall amount of servers and activity is decent. There are a lot of servers with varying game modes. The community seems OK from what I've seen on the forums, so no complaint there. However, I wish this game had Workshop support and more updates. Even though there is no Workshop, mods are pretty easy to download, but since Return to Blockland was discontinued they are a bit harder to get to work. Overall, I'd recommend it with a 7.5/10			"

												Blockland is a worth-it kind of game where you are this little character who is able to build his OWN GAME inside of the game. It's also worth it seeing the fact that you can meet people on the way rather by joining someone's game or making your own. It's honestly what it says. It's YOUR world with YOUR own rules.			"

												Don't get this game unless you want to play in a dieing game.Now, don't get me wrong, i play this game EVERY day, and i love it, but to be honest, It's dying, according to many other players.One of my friends was banned from the forums for asking the DEVELOPER for news on updates, and the notice was ""♥♥♥♥ You, I Don't Owe You Anything"". And she PAYED for the game. That's the DEVELOPER saying ""Hah, you bought my game, but ♥♥♥♥ off."" And, i'll probably be replied by the developer or something or my comment removed, but atleast someone might see this.It's a fun game, but the community is starting to turn very nasty. Very little original gamers play anymore, me being one of the few. And, the only reason why the developer still does tiny tweaks every few months or so is because ""It makes me too much money to stop."" Don't get the game unless you plan to play in a dying game.

												PROS:-Graphics: Graphics are quite nice. The bricks are very accurate to real life. Plus there are shaders.-Eventing: You can program your bricks to appear/disappear, shoot a rocket, or you could build an entire computer!-Bots: Comes with fully programmable bots. You can make them kill you, or fight for you.CONS:-Addons: You needs loads of addons to do anything really cool, or to get people to join your server.-RTB: Return to Blockland was a great addon system with advanced features and IRC, and it no longer exists.-Eventing: The event interface is nice for beginners, but once you start making more complex things, it becomes quite cumbersome.-Lack of updates: The developer is inactive most of the time. Don't expect anything more to come out of this.-Vehicle physics: Vehicles glitch through walls/floor, especially flying ones.-Controls: Sometimes they are quite hard for beginners to learn, mostly building. If you don't have a number pad, this can become quite difficult.Yep, that's my take on the game. It really has the potential; but it just wasn't executed right.			"

												Ok, before you start dissing me on this, let me just say a few things:1. Just because RTB's service was shutdown, it does NOT mean the game is ruined. You can still get addons off of mirrors, and some addons even have a new IRC/addons manager. You can even still use the old RTB client for managing your addons as well, just not downloading them.2. Badspot is not saying the community is the problem. He is saying that it is a specific age group, and he can not control all of them. They host their own servers, with their own rules. Don't get mad if one of them happens to ban you for acting annoying to them or others, or you don't read their rules.3. When you think of the community, you're probably thinking of the forums. Let me just say, that you're probably browsing the Off-Topic section and just saying that's not normal. Please note, you are looking in the OFF-TOPIC section. Most Blockland related things are in the Blockland, Files, and Modification Help sections.Alright, now to the review.This game is a load of fun, mainly because you can honestly do whatever you want. You can build a house, make a sprite from a game in blocks, have a deathmatch with some friends, it's almost ALL customizable.There's also addons you can download to add new blocks, events, weapons, tools, and other things to the game. A example of a new way to play is Unlimited Mining, which is exactly what it says on the tin: Mining that can stretch forever. It may seem boring, but it's not just the same ores. The deeper you dig, the closer you get to the Core, which has more valuable and radiated ores. and then, there's the secret area above grounds, that's very difficult to find...The multiplayer's fun as well, you just need to be careful on what servers you go on, and read their rules carefully. Some people don't seem to get this, and end up joining random servers, get banned, and get all flustered wondering what they did wrong. People have their own rules, and others might not want you on your server.And finally, there's the downtime. Normally, this isn't our fault. It's a problem with a few other people, like BDX, or Man of Reason, DDoSing the server when they feel like it, causing the master server and forums to go down. The master server is how you are able to see the server list. If that's down, you probably won't be able to join any servers.Even though this game may seem off due to bad reviews, this game is what helped me finally play with others and have some fun. It was fun in 2008, and it's fun now. Try buying it while it's on sale, when it ever does, so you can spend less to try it. Even better, you can download the demo here: http://blockland.us/Download.htmlYou'll have to buy the game in order to play past the block limit, but trust me, it's much better when you're not limited.

												It's an OK game, save for the developer that really doesn't care about the game at all. But the harsh reality is that nobody plays it (there's usually only one server online with around 16 people), and the people who still do are mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. It makes enjoying the online multiplayer quite hard. There's practically no saving it as everyone who first bought it on Steam mostly abandoned it before reaching 5 hours playtime. Steam would have been the best way to save this game, but every new person that bought it didn't even care to return to it.The only way I can recommend this game is if either:You are really interested in playing this type of gameorYou have a group of friends willing to play with you (that won't abandon the game after playing it once)It's an OK game at best that still fills a niche that many other games don't really fill that well, if you're into it. Don't expect much from the developer, and the community is basically doomed from a bad steam release.			"

												My review for BlocklandEven though there isn't really many people that play this game, it is still fun if you enjoy building with lego, I can't stop playing it (as you can see by my hours (2557 as of writing this review)There are many types of servers to choose from ranging from Boss battles to City Roleplay there is even freebuilds and mini empiresSo if you like to build using lego, this is the game for you.

												I love this game.No, let me rephrase that.I loveD this game.This game used to be great. There were many custom maps to explore, and lots of community gamemodes to play. There was always a lot of people to play with and the community was generally awesome. Did you notice any thing about those last sentences? One; Everything I listed was community-made. The developer's actual content is not very interesting to play with for more than a few hours. Two; It was past tense. Maps were actually REMOVED from the game for no good reason and a good portion of the community left due to that. And then RTB stopped. RTB, or Return to Blockland, was a mod for Blockland which worked as a mod manager and also friends list. RTB was awesome and was the only thing anyone used to keep track of friends and get mods. And then, one day, RTB was gone. The servers were down and you couldn't download it anymore. That caused a large portion of to leave the game and now we're left with the remains of a once amazing game, barely managing to keep enough players.You could buy this game as it is. I wouldn't blame you. This game is still good, if only for a day or two. But if you do buy this don't get it on steam, and get this (free) version to go along with it: https://github.com/portify/blockland-20DISCLAIMER: You cannot use this without owning Blockland, and even if you could, I would not endorse doing so without a purchase. If you run a server on the main master server of Blockland using this version, your account may be terminated. You cannot use this with the steam version of Blockland because steam users do not have keys.			"

Plenty of role play servers for those type and freebuild servers for those who do not like to be restricted to various rules. What you don't understand is this game has no limit to what you want to create. You can litterly build a RPG server like one of those free mmos you find on steam that suck.

												A true classic of a game. A wonderful game released in 2007, before any game with pixel art or blocks was a ""CRAPPY MINECRAFT CLONE XDDD""and before Minecraft or Terraria even existed. This was just a simple game that was spread by mouth, gifted to friends, enjoyed all the time, and, of course, was incredibly fun. It still is! It's definitely worth the 10 bucks, and if you're too worried about spending that, just go ahead and pick it up when it's on sale! It's a classic game that is also a BLAST with friends.			"

												The game is very fun and interesting, and building in a lego world has endless possibilities. The game also has a lot of add-ons and modifications.However, the worst part of Blockland is the community. Just go to http://forum.blockland.us and see how horrible it is for youself. It's basically a group of users who argue a lot and spend more time on the forums than playing the actual game. Development is also deteriorating. Version 21, which was released in August 2012, was the last major update to the game. It was supposed to make it easier to add more features in the future, but a major update has not been released yet. Blockland also uses a 15-year-old game engine and this causes a lot of problems for add-on makers, such as glitchy vehicle physics and limitations on projectile speed.In conclusion: great gameplay and originality, but horrible community and slow development.EDIT: Yesterday, Heedicalking, a notable member of the Blockland community peacefully protested against the lack of the new features (which were promised exactly 2 years ago). Badspot, the owner of the game, deleted his posts and banned him on three accounts: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54466069/banned.png "

												My son nagged me to get this game.  We have loaded it and it does not work on a Mac.  What really bugs me is that I have been looking on line and this problem has been known for several years without any solution as far as I can tell but the game is still being sold as Mac compatible.  You will get a warning about preferences.  This warning basically means that you can't save many of the changes in the game.  People who played the game without steam first can copy files across to fix it, but this is not an option open to those who don't.  Frankly I do not think that something should be conisdered saleable if you have to start changing preferences on individual files and loading code to make it work.Very very poor which is a pity because everything I read about the gaem itself suggests that it is a great game when it works.

												Although I do still find the game entertaining from time to time, I would not recommend it now for other users. Here are the reasons why:The in-game servers and content don't have the same variety or atmosphere as they had when I first bought the game 3 or 4 years ago. Although that could just be nostalgia talking, that is, of course, something that drastically affects my relationship and experience with the game.The engine isn't at all the best (After all, it's more than a decade old. To be more frank, the game engine is virtually ancient.), which puts some signifcant limitations on modders, despite the admittedly incredulous amount of flexibility and ease of the add-on system.Although there are some good-looking shaders, they are not well-optimised, and were put into the game hastily at the cost of the mapping system that the game had, at the dismay of many players.The creator of the game, Badspot, has shown little to no interest in actively participating in enriching Blockland's community and playability, and although he does argue that the players are very much capable of expanding the enjoyment of the game, the players alone are not as impactful as an update from the creator of the game that would allow more capacity to do what you want with the game, regardless of the level of quality and initiative of the said community at hand.Although that's all I could think of right now, I will add more of my gripes and arguments about this game in later edits, and maybe even possibly completely rewrite this review. Like I said earlier, it's not as fun and filled with variety in user-generated content as it was before, which could very well say something about the community. I have been playing far before the game even was greenlighted on Steam, and have witnessed the transformation of this game overtime. If the developer of the game or other members of the community would like to talk to me about this review, or perhaps get feedback from me on my opinion on how to improve the game, you are more than welcome to. Thanks for reading.			"

												It's a fun time sink of a game, unfortunatly what drove me orignally to the game was it's great community. A few years ago we were like a little family, all the regulars knew each other and all helped out together, but trying to play on any server nowadays leads to saddness feeling like we've lost the game, don't play it for the comunity. The final straw was the v21 update; all yall  young whipper snappers don't know the pain from the death of the terrain. It was truly tragic for most players, we traded off brilliant 3d maps with hills and terrains for what? shaders that probably still totally suck, brick collisions with both vehicals and entities are garbage, kiling off some of the more popular servers. It's been a while since of played but I seriously doubt anything has changed.If you do just like legos and building things, this is the game for you.----EDIT----Since some ♥♥♥ hat couldnt interpret that I played the game before steam, given my .7 hours play time and the fact that I said I played while there was terrain, while also complimenting(?) my grammar, I just need to point out that I have put thousands of hours into this game, I started playing around june of 2011. dunno if ID's are still a thing, but look up 30927. the name SHOULD be TestZombie, unless one of my dumb-as-nails siblings changed it when i forgot to log off steam once.----EDIT----Thinking about what this game used to be litterally gives me depression. It's like the original TEEN TITANS series compared to Teen Titans Go; except instead of TTG its actually just a 15 minute video of a dog Taking a ♥♥♥♥ then being hit by a train.OH and what I edited to say was - apparently mods don't even exist for the game now that it has been green lit to steam, this was practiaclly Lego Gary's Mod except 100x better than the 2 of them combined, so the terrain death update shortly followed by Steam destroyed the very small glimmer of hope that could possibly have still existed for this game. Honestly, I think the game is false advertising when it uses Tenski's Blockland trailer which exclusevly showed mods made by the comunity.Also I don't know where, but I heard a rumor fairly recently that RTB (a beautiful mod, the mother of all mods, a mod that allowed players to have Friends (obviously this part deppreciated by steam) and also group chats and a beautifull IRC with several mods and bots at all times, it was a mod and (before that solely) a website that allowed people to create and share mods to be downloaded easily in game or manually; I heard that it may be coming back, it's not enough to save; scratch that, resurect this game, but with dedication that I don't believe exists anymore,			"

												TL;DR, the community is dead but the game would be really ♥♥♥♥ing good if people got back on itI'll be honest, back when I got this game a few years before it got greenlit the community was really thriving in comparison to how it's like today. A part of me even thinks that the greenlight was only done to try and garner new players, which obviously didn't work out much at all.Blockland isn't like Minecraft or Roblox, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Blockland is a lego-style sandbox that (in my eyes) is a nice blend between the game mechanics that Minecraft and Roblox have to offer. You don't need to be an expert in some external first-party program to build great games, (Like Roblox) and you don't need to build massive contraptions to give your basic blocky world some life and functionality. (Like Minecraft) You are already given all the base tools you need to build things like RPGs, deathmatch arenas, cities, race tracks, whatever you want.The community is less than to be desired, I'll be the first to admit. But it's not like any game community is perfect, you'll always have trolls and kids trying to mess with you or other players, but that's in the spirit of the freedom that these kinds of games will bring. With the community pretty much washed out at this point, I'd say some sort of revival, a ""renaissance"" if you will, would make it blossom into the large and creative community we saw back in it's golden days.If you're new to the game, I recommend getting it during a steam sale in case you aren't satisfied. If you happen to know what Blockland was like but haven't gotten it yet, €10 is a small price to pay in my opinion.Gameplay - 9/10- Minigames - 8/10- Building - 10/10- Multiplayer - 9/10Community - 5.5/10- Old: 8/10- Current: 3/10			"

Most builds on servers are pretty poorly built (but that's okay, we have to start somewhere).+ The game still functions, still has some people playing. Every once in a while, some person builds something magical. Has a forum, that people use to post add-ons, server info and builds.			"

												I've grown up with Blockland for 5 years, and it has taught me a lot of things along it's pretty bumpy road. It's gotten me entirely into what I can call a 'lust for technology', because otherwise, I wouldn't be as interested in technology as a whole if it weren't for Blockland. Another thing is that, most everything I have learned or started to develop a skill about is also rounded about on Blockland, specificly, my sound designing 'expertise'. As a side note, I'm actually investing in sound recording equipment this christmas.Blockland is not only largely based upon it's users to make content, much like Roblox or maybe even Minecraft, but it does a good job of making it easy to do so. I'm just barely starting off with being a content creator for the game yet I've already got the ropes, and I already create some good stuff for the game.The community isn't as great as most lego games, but it's in a way, a 'mature' community. The community is incredibly assholish, especially on the forums, but in a way where most of the people won't go overboard over small things, and if you aren't a total idiot people won't try to kill you.Lastly, I just wanna say, Blockland has many memories planting itself into my mind that I probably will never forget. The game holds so much promise for the future, and has always delivered in the past. People have doubted it before, even the community itself, but the game always keeps moving forward. Roblox, to compare, still retains it's immature community, it's pretty laggy systems, and it's really money-sucking notoriety for builders club.			"

												I think this game has gone downhill for a while. I remember when I first played it in 2010 and it was pretty decent I guess. There was a good stream of updates now and then and the game was actually enjoyable. But now I have no idea where it's gone to. The community of the game really drags it down for me, and since this game is almost 90% based on multiplayer, it might affect you too. The community is not forgiving at all so if you do something wrong/bad you will still be bashed for it years later. The community loves to accuse you of doing things that you never did, such as conducting a denial of service attack. Nowadays, the creator barely pushes out updates and there hasn't been any meaningful updates for what seems to be an eternity. The creator of the game also is censoring people's negative reviews and banning them from discussions for peacefully expressing their opinions both on Steam and the Blockland Forums (by the way, if you're going to play the game, never join the Blockland Forums for sure. I can't tell you how screwed up that place is). The game is, from time to time, enjoyable when you find a good server that is fun and has no hostile/bashing people on it. But otherwise I think this game has really gotten worse since my first purchase of it in 2010. You choose if you want the game and are willing to completely ignore the community. I don't suggest you play it if you want to play on multiplayer a lot. The community is small and everybody can quickly know who you are and attack you for the rest of your stay if you screw up a few times.Also there's the ""screw-up recurrence"" game. You screw up and you know what you did was dumb. But the community keeps attacking you so you intentionally fight back and then at that point you're marked as a ""problem user"" and immediately banned from all game discussions. So if you like to express your opinions without censorship regarding the game, this is not the place to do it.Yeah my review will probably be censored since i'm marked as a ""problem"" user but what can I say? You choose if you can ignore a hostile/corrupted/censoring community and creator where people actually think you can mark an ""opinion"" as wrong. If you can, sure, play the game all you want and maybe you'll enjoy it. If you don't think you can, you might not want to try this game. I think this game is pretty good but the community/creator is bad. That's just my personal opinion, you can try the game and see if you like it. I mean it has events, vehicles, add-ons, weapons and a bunch of cool stuff but the community / creator drag it down for me so you can choose if it matters to you.*UPDATE 8/7/2014*The creator also has censored posts / banned people from the official game forum. The posts were constructive criticism (not intended to insult or flame in any way) which expressed disappointment due to the lack of meaningful updates and unmet promises of the developers. The community member who has most recently been affected by this is Heedicalking, a well known community member who is known for making good servers (frequently team deathmatch servers).He expressed his disappointment in the lack of development in a constructive and respectful way but he was banned twice and his posts were censored (deleted).Here is a backup of the censored posts (they are written by Whitebeard and SHU-YA)http://blocklandcloud.com/20140807-heedicalking-deleted-posts/ http://blocklandcloud.com/20140807-heedicalking-deleted-posts2/ "

												The game was good for its time but there are better things available now. I wouldn't reccomend picking up Blockland as the developer has essentially stopped working on the product.Minecraft is a much more adventure-based sandbox game with a lively modding community and is suitable for younger players (including children), but doesn't lose its appeal on adults.Space Engineers is (as of writing) an early access game for building your own space craft. Its building system feels like Blockland, but it's backed by a very cool physics engine. More suitable for older players and adults, especially if you're interested in realism and engineering based sandbox games.Blockland was a game I played for quite some time, but it hasn't aged well and has been usurped by newer and better things.

												Against all my instincts I bought this game. What I was faced with was instant regret and $10 less than I had beforehand. I am a very picky customer and I VERY rarely buy games but when I was told this game was like garrysmod meets legos I thought, okay maybe I'll give this a shot. What I was faced with was horrifying. I started up the game, went to create my character and was faced with the saddest excuse for a character creation system ever. It was so poorly designed and shallow that many would confuse that monstrosity for the work of ljn. This game is so poorly designed and it seems to be aimed towards children 6 to 10. It was a fair attempt but it just falls flat in my opinion. The video samples of the game were convincing so I thought maybe that the gameplay could be redeeming. After a painstakingly long loading screen, I was faced with terrible gameplay, no voice chat options and a painful amount of little kids. Among this little kids were ""Pizza Man"", ""Buttman"", and ""Awesome Guy"". This game has made me question everything I once held as holy. Please, NEVER buy this horrible, horrible game because all that awaits you is immediate disappointment. After I finish this review I am instantly deleting this garbage. It isn't worth the 50 MB it takes up. If anyone needs me I'll be weeping over the loss of my $10. I would buy this MAYBE for $2 but I would have to be in a REALLY bad way to resort to this game. Stick to flash games over this. They are free, you won't get burned, and you won't have the feeling of looming stupidity that I am currently experiencing. Spend your money on gum instead, a lot of gum. You will get more use out of it.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played, personally. The community is horrible at times, and extremely helpful at others. I started the game a while ago, then stopped playing it for a bit (I got bored of it). Then, I came back a year later, seeing no maps, and got slightly angry for a few days, and then got over it to see what it'd become. Bad, good, decent, hilarious, pathetic; Those were all going through my head as I relearned Blockland, although this time, I learned something new - Events. Eventing in Blockland is personally my favorite part (followed closely by the capability of them, and what you can make out of them). I still have a weekly rage session, just because some stupid thing happened in-game, but I don't mind. It's still among my favorite games. (Although something I don't like is the amount of roleplay in the game - specifically FNAF roleplay...)			"

												Well... It's interesting.I can see some people's issues with there not being enough parts, but the fact that you can make (or download) parts and toss them into an Add-Ons folder kinda gets rid of that complaint.  I think the biggest failing is the fact that the tutorial is REALLY basic, expecially where the wrench is concerned.  This game looks to be extremely powerful, but withot utilizing that power it's kind of like Superman having to remain Clark Kent because the world is made of Kryptonite.Now, that aside, I'm seeing a pretty nice game here.  The block selection is done fairly well, allowing you to customize your quick-bars to whatever parts you wish to use.  In addition you use the mouse to begin placement of a block, but then use the numberpad to fine-tune that placement.  This is great in a 3D environment, as it truly gives you easy control of your building.  It even goes so far to, when placing something wrong, tell you exactly why the placement was rejected (overlapping, etc).  Finally, there are enough DEMO worlds in this game that you can truly see all of the possibilities you can get into (as long as you know how the wrench works).When it all comes down to it, do I recommend people play this game?  Yes I do.  THAT SAID, continue reading...I do recommend people play this game, however I only recommend BUYING the game if you can get it at a reduced price like I did.  I got this game as part of a $2.99 bundle on Bundle Stars, and for that price this game is well worth the money.  Would I pay $10+ for it?  Absolutely not, because it doesn't have a strong dev team behind it, the developer has a really bad attitude, and I doubt it'll ever be ""finished"".  The most I'd ever pay is $2.99 for this game by itself...  That's a lot, considering I'm expecting the developer to see a lawsuit by Lego in the future.			"

												This is easily one of my most played games of all time. You can pretty much do anything you want in this lego building environment, and in terms of it's building mechanics, you will find none better than Blockland. There is also an incredibly large amount of player-made resources and mods to expand the gameplay to pretty much anything you can think of. Stop playing games that limit you to building with one size blocks and play a game that truly gave many the best gaming experiences they've ever had. Also while you're at that, check out my blockland videos on my Youtube channel!youtube.com/sirherg1 "

												Blockland is a sandbox game in LEGO style. BTW how did they manage the licence problem? Blockland has a long history with an included social media platform and earlier IRC chats. I have heard of uncountable user maps that have exist. The hope is that on steam this project will be revived. There are several new game servers and now you're able to communicate over steam.The graphics are average. For good example there's a fog of distance. But it is comfortable on the other side to play it just in window mode if you want. You can choose different game modes like car races or battle arena or free building. Blockland's strength is the huge library of existing models and build parts. It's easy to set spawn points for zombies or equip weapons to your character.Tough there are other LEGO style or Minecraft style games out there, like Ace of Spades, but i think Blockland is a tryout worth.

												This game, this game right here is really, really awesome! It's like playing with legos, on the computer, and you don't have to buy the said legos. This game is what I have played a lot, just like another game I've played a lot. If you love legos, and are too lazy to get the money to buy real legos, then this game is for you. And one of the awesome things is that you can host your own server if you wanted, and addons are really easy to install. I recommend this game to people who have someform of creativity and loves legos. Just becarful when exploring the server list, there are some strange servers out there... not saying all of the servers are bad, just some of those servers could cause you to lose your sanity being there. I happen to host a server, though I don't get very many players thanks to certaint people who shan't be named for reasons that I will not tell you about. Though there can be some downsides to this game, it tends to cause weaker computers to crash, which is annoying since I have a horrable computer, but if you know what you're doing, and keep the addon count small, you'll be fine with hosting a server, and don't be afraid to ban people, they break the rules on your server, so it gives you the full right to ban them. And there are other people who complan about how bad the server is, and here's a little tip when dealing with them, simply tell them this ""My server, my rules. If you got a problem with this, then get off of my server."" and then ban them if they do not stop, and if you don't want them returning day after day, calling you some very rude, and stupid, names, then perma ban them, like I said, it's your server, you decide how it works, if people don't like it, then they don't like it. You can't change that. And be sure to be a very kind person so people like you, if you do that, more and more people will show up on your server. These are my words of wisdom for hosting a server, I'd share my wisdom on how to not be banned on other servers within five seconds, but I do not have time for that today. Good luck, my good people, you're going to need it. Also, check out my some of my guides for Blockland, I only have one at the moment, but feel free to check them out!			"

												Started this game back in 2007ish when I was very young, I love it. You can do a multitude of things from building, shooting, driving, and many more things. The addons you can acquire make the game fifty times better and they add more possibilties than the default vanilla game. The shadows and shaders replaced maps back in 2012, which I think was very bad idea; a lot of the fun things are no longer there, like skiing on The Slopes map. The community is also very garbage; I steer as far as possible from the forums (besides the addon section), especially the drama section.All in all, have friends to play with, get tons of addons, stay away from 95% of the community, and have some fun.

												WARNING!!! THIS GAME HAS ONE OF THE WORST COMMUNITIES EVER!This has got to be one of the best sandbox games I have ever played. I bought it back in 2009 and have been playing it ever since. When I moved my game from the standard launcher to Steam, my friends asked about it. I recommended this game to them, and now, to you unsure buyers. Let's start with what you can do.1. Build massive structures with a block limit of 256000 blocks2. Drive around in a set amount of vehicles with rather good handling3. Kill zombies, animals, and bots4. Paint blocks to create art5. Add effects and lights to bricks to make an already impressive structure look better6. Mods! Make your game WAY better with more bricks, weapons, vehicles, paint, decals, etc!7. Build signs out of individual bricks8. Be a better person than anybody in the community9. Build and fight with your friends and other players10. Customize your character with different faces, body decals, and even a few hats.AND MUCH MORE!TL;DRThis game is incredible, but has a terrible community.			"

												Blockland did go downhill when it went onto steam, I've had blockland forever I was one of the first 500 people or less to get the game. My old computer died and I lost my Blockland I.D with it, but when it came onto steam I saw it and of course got it again. I put quite a few hours onto the game, but I don't know what happened..I guess it got old or was it the lact of  maturity in the community? The mods aren't as good as they used to be but there are fun game modes that kept me occupied for a while. Maybe it's simply just because I got older, I've gotten more into serious Rping on Gmod but who knows I may get old of that and go back to Blockland, but for now It's been fun I may come back to play. I hope you more fun playing this game.			"

												Blockland has a bit of a history. In 2005, it was a little work-in-progress building game on the Torque Game Engine. Being an alpha, it had (here comes a massive understatement) quite a few mods that generated a larger following. The full game released in 2007, and much more polished than anything seen before. Streams of updates from the game's sole creator (with some collaboration thrown in) in the past six years have created a unique game that nothing can hope to come close to.So, what's the main point? Blockland is That Game Where You Build Stuff. It's all on you, and the community. Using LEGO-like blocks to create structures in online multiplayer may sound mundane on paper, but the online part is where it really shines. The amount of creativity Blockland players have is nothing short of amazing. User-created add-ons like weapons and vehicles are plentiful, allowing for different and fun gamemodes within buildings YOU create, and an ""events"" system gives way for even more creativity within builds.An accessible sandbox game for such a price is almost a steal.

It was in developement before Minecraft(around 2005) so don't even try to compare these two.You can do almost everything here - build tons of stuff using easy build method with endless blocks, then invite your friends and build something together! Or shoot each other for fun! What makes it even more better is add-ons - install ReturnToBlockland IMMEDIATELY after you have played a bit and know how things work - it is a built-in-game overlay to chat with people and download many add-ons which enhance gameplay.This game is definately worth your time and money.

												First and foremost, this is NOT another minecraft gameBlockland is a Garry's mod meet Legos meets [Insert anything here]Like garry's mod in the way that you make it what you want it to be, be it an adventure RPG, Modern day RP or perhaps a zombie survival Left 4 Dead.At least around 400-800 people are playing blockland at any given time, so it's far from dead, my only complaint is that Badspot (The dev) removed premade maps from the game, meaning any terrian you want to have you have to build yourself or download it from someone else.The game runs smoothly on most PCs so don't worry about your system specs and is a game i recommend to anyone who enjoys Garry's mod and or Legos, this game is a dream come true for me, hell, i even used to host the most popular medieval-rp server back in 2012.Also, you're not limited to being a block person, you're able to play as any NPC or rigged vehicle, meaning playable dragon characters which you can customize with different colors, tanks, horses.ect (Yes peole can ride you)Now when i said it's like Garry's mod meets Legos, i ment just that, in Garry's mod you have to download addons made by the community, which you can do ingame easily without any hassle, it's as simple as searching for a mod and click download.Currently there's a massive amount of addons available from dragons, flintlock weapons, lasers, lego weapons, LOADS OF VEHICLES OH GOD, and gamemodes, not to mention custom builds like giant fantasy castles and what-not.So to anyone who is unsure about the game or is turned off my the fact that there are blocks.This /is/ a Garry's mod game, with Legos, and quite frankly i LOVE legos.(PS, playable dragons and Hydralisk(StarCraft) characters are a massive upgrade from Garry's mod in my eyes, and considering how easy it is to create your own mods it's definitely worth picking up for those who have talent with Blender)			"

												One of my favorite games  ever.People write bad reviews for this game because the community is dead or the devs arent updating the game.People say the community sucks.This game came out like in 2007...i think,i wouldnt want to work on one game for years at a time.You can find plenty decently full servers.I personally havent had a problem with the community at all.Sure it would be nice to have consistent updates to the game but that isnt really a big deal to me.There are plenty of mods and custom gamemodes for this game to mess around with.

												I have been on Blockland for around 4.5 years, and is still not even near old. Every time I turn it on, there's always something to do, if you have a creative mind, this game is perfect for you. You can make nearly anything, houses, citys, spaceships, e.t.c. Even though the game comes with some default items, bricks e.t.c, there is a giant bunch of add-ons you can add to the game, to make it even more fun. Even though the loss of interiors and terrain has happened, the game is still as fun as ever. Blockland also has an event system, where you can make stuff happen, like make bricks dissapear, have them change color, and with Event add-ons, that's even fun too. The price used to be £18, and I think the game is worth it, and now, it's £7, so now you can have the same fun, for a good price, I am not even the tinyest bit annoyed about how I had to pay £17 and not £7, as Badspot (the creator) fully deserves it. I'm sorry for the giant review, but that's just how great and fun this game is. I could never understand how people can not like this game, as it's packed with a ton of stuff to do. I'd recommend this to everyone.			"

												Just a minecraft rip-off you say? Never! This game is more than meets the eye, and whilst is unmistakably similar to the chart top, award winning phenomenon that is mine craft, it is very much its own ticket. Blockland is like all the fun parts of minecraft put at your feet, with all the incentive to accompany it and more. It’s more of a thrill ride than minecraft that encourages griefing and killing other players, needless to say this will give you endless amounts of laughs and surpise you for many hours. If you managed to pick this up in a bundle, great! If not and you’re like for a pixelated fix, it’s worth every dollar!  "

												I may have played this a while but hear me out. It was actualy fun at first. Yet it just seemed to get more and more boring. All of the servers are all and all the same and for ten bucks I wish I knew about the refund system when I bought this about a year ago. I wouldn't spend ten bucks on this game simply because it just becomes more and more boring. The more you play the more it just feels like any other cheap building games like ROBLOX and at least ROBLOX was free and the people who made the games had variety. Most of these servers are just random people building random rubbish with the sort of complicated building system.			"

AUDIOSimpleVISUALLegoDIFFICULTYAverageVIBEGoofyCRAVINGGarry's ModON SALERarelyPROS: Lots of building options, tons of color, texture and block shape options to build just about anything you put your mind to. Mount, weapon, and interactive options galore. This is probably one of the best building games out there.CONS: Community appears to be entirely made up of very young children. There also appears to be no options for spawned features/copy-paste in worlds, meaning that you will have to download or make maps entirely by yourself, piece-by-piece. Controls are very complex.WORTH: It's worth full price if you're a building fanatic, but you may have trouble finding people to play with if you wish to enjoy the more multiplayer aspects. It doesn't go on sale as often as other games do, so you might have to wait a while for a discount.OVERALL: A lot of people say this game peaked about 5 years ago or so. I wouldn't know, because I wasn't there-- But it is clear that this game is full of potential that is not being utilized for one reason or another. It's disappointing that I will not be able to do much with my creations beyond screenshot them or show them to close friends who also own this.SCORE:5/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

Whether you're here for building, modmaking, or hosting the craziest server game ever, or even just like watching other players explode, there's always something to do in here. Anyone who wants a change of pace from thier usual letting-off-steam game should hop in.P.S. Get the RTB mod to let you see a wide collection of add-ons easy-peasy to start really going nuts.

												Almost over a year ago I already made a review on this old piece.Sure, blockland is losing players, but you have to admit that it has stood the test of time. It's funny even today people keep calling it a roblox and minecraft rip off.Let me put you at ease:Blockland's Release Date: February 24, 2007Minecraft's Release Date: October 7, 2011Notice the issue here? How can blockland rip off minecraft if it didn't exist for 4 more years?Roblox's Release Year: 2006Blockland is 1 year younger than Roblox, but this does not make it a rip off. Since 2006 & 2007 the game's have taken turns, mostly roblox has, and blockland has not been trying to rip off roblox. If it has why do the games look nothing alike?Anyways, I still will recommend this old sandbox for years to come and hope it will survive the test of time as long as it can.			"

It's for builders of all skill levels, Ranging from making simple houses, deathmatch levels, to speedkart tracks and specific builds for custom gamemodes.

												The game overall is very funny and addictive at times, Blockland is basically a First-Person/Third-Person sandbox where you have the game world in your hands to build whatever comes out of your mind. With an environment editor, eventing system, a variety of bricks to choose from the game is pretty fun.With mods, everything changes, the game is absolutely much more better when you have mods installed to your game, these add-ons can include new bricks, vehicles, clients, scripts, events, and so on. There's also a new dedicated service called Blockland Glass, a mod hosting service and chat service that is basically a replacement from the abandoned Return To Blockland.The community is small, but you can find good people here, some are toxic, but that's what you'd expect from games. there's usually over a hundred people online every day, but at night around the US, it lowers. Numerous servers can be found though, and you have the ability to buy one from a community hosted service, or you are able to host your sever dedicated or non-dedicated.The last pro is that the game itself has it's own forum, called Blockland Forums, here you can find many threads and topics that mostly relate to Blockland, except the off-topic. Add-ons are mainly released there, and you can find many discussions, such as help with the game, making add-ons, or generally talking about anything else related to Blockland.The game is very fun in my opinion, and it sadly got it's last big update in 2013, when the game was released on Steam. Things have come and gone by then, but I'd assure that you'd have a good time playing the game when you have friends. My experience in Blockland so far gives me a rating of a 8/10.Blockland Forums can be found here - https://forum.blockland.us/Blockland Glass can be found here -https://blocklandglass.com/Blockland Glass Hosting Service can be found here - https://forum.blockland.us/index.php?PHPSESSID=8or55m13cuhi6ohrhos2ie0ej2&topic=303684.0 "

												I remember having given Blockland in Christmas of 2009 (And re-buying and still playing it via Steam at this point). And back in the day, it tended to be a clone of Roblox in terms of building blocks and other notible assets. Which THEN, a few months ago, made people point out ""AAAH THIS IS MINECRAFT BUT ALL SCRATCHY AND SHIZZ"" and was going like that ever since. Yup, I know how you Minecraft peoples are.So for this review, I'm not only going to review this game, but compare this to Minecraft a bit, and why I sometimes like to dub this ""Hipster Minecraft"".So basically what Blockland is, is a first-person sandbox multiplayer create-your-own-anything game. SOUND FAMILIAR??? You control inhabitants known as ""Blockheads"" and build anything, Yup, quite familiar. HOWEVER, you do NOT start in a pre-generated world. It is a flatgrass-style area you find yourself in. All saves you make are only builds, and not whole worlds, which is not as convoluted as Minecraft as all you can do to get a build you made is straight-up load it like a schematic.Now for building things and designing games, functions, etc.: You can see building is quite advanced and more difficult than Minecraft. But it's great if you want a first-person Sandbox building game with more detailed models than Minecraft, as Minecraft is all 1-meter blocks and very flat compared to Blockland blocks. For functions, you can use a Wrench to make blocks emit light and particles, as well as implement functions to make games and programming. Minecraft pretty much does the same thing with Command Blocks, etc., but IMO, Blockland is more simple than Minecraft in terms of functions. Because Minecraft's functioning requires specific functions and assets, sometimes extra mods, to make a good mechanism. I MIGHT be missing something here, as I have never tried such functions myself in Minecraft, but I should say that you have no information to design Minecraft functioning whatsoever unless you use the internet, which I don't really like doing given how the Minecraft community is nowadays.Blockland may be difficult and advanced to build than Minecraft, with all the little blocks to use and everything, but I found that it's much simpler to build what I want without getting my ♥♥♥♥ kicked in Minecraft trying to obtain a specific asset for my work. People would say Minecraft is waaaay better than Blockland that they hate this game, but I'm one of the few who played it back then and had a good time, speaking of which...Everybody knows Minecraft is the way to go besides Blockland. But for the nosalgia, or stuff Minecraft can't as mentioned above, I play this. I'm one of the few who actually like this game and I'm glad it doesn't have a fustercluck of a community like Minecraft, which is what I was anxious to point out. I really admire how quiet and underrated Blockland and its community is compared to Minecraft, and even Roblox as well. (I also played Roblox and it was pretty cheezy). Minecraft's majority of fans has pretty much bubble-bursted, where Blockland is ""Just right"", however getting beat down by Minecraft.But I will say this as I finish up this review. Blockland came years before Minecraft. It is not exactly a ripoff of Minecraft, which I apparently am seeing an award of which this game attained. I give this game a thumbs up, as it was what got me going before Minecraft was all the rage. This is just my opinion though. I'm only proving a point about Blockland vs Minecraft, and NO I do not think Blockland < Minecraft. It's all the Minecraft tweenies that are implying that this game is crapple. When I play Minecraft, I have that feeling that I shouldn't be playing this game anymore, whereas in Blockland, it's calm and I don't need to be reminded by the overdose Minecraft has become. (I still like Minecraft though)			"

												Blockland is a great game, in my opinion.I know that most of the veteran community disappeared, due to the update (v21) which removed maps, and terrain. It was devastating for them. But new players may not understand how maps and terrain meant everything to them.The developer (Eric ""Badspot"" Hartman) has given up on the game, and pretty much wrenched it on Steam as a last-ditch attempt to squeeze out some more money of the players. I believe the community have pressured Badspot too much. Take notice of my forum post: https://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=308505.0 Another thing: Barely anyone plays Blockland anymore. Back in 2009, 2010, or 2011, you would find thousands of servers and people on at once. The last time that happened when thousands were online, was on Thursday, June 26th 2014. 1843 people were online then. It went down over the next few days, but that was about it. If you want to know how much servers there were, guess what. On the exact same day there were so many players, there was 600 servers online. Not kidding. 2014 was the only peak high year that Blockland had post-map-terrain-update. Nowadays, there's only 100 servers! 500 servers less than it was in 2014.Blockland was born in late-2003, and was created using a 14-year old game engine: Torque Engine. If you want to create addons, you'll have to learn TorqueScript and some Blender. I'm not gonna lie, most players have created some *really cool* content, if you look in the trailer. Although, not really anyone hosts these cities or whatever anymore.Blockland is barely updated anymore, so don't expect updates. Badspot only does REALLY tiny updates, and I really mean really tiny updates. If you want to see it for yourself, check it out here: https://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=302905.0As you can see, there were only 3 or 4 fixes.The community is pretty alive and well, but most of the new community are just unpleasant.

If you're not a fan of 14-year old game engines, it's not for you.			"

												I'm not sure I'll be able to put my feelings for this game in words as eloquently as some of the other reviews here, but I'll do my best.I would like to start off by saying that I have, at the very least, 2000 hours logged into this game pre-steam. Blockland is the first game I ever bought, almost 6 years ago. Holy ♥♥♥♥. Back then, it was still $20, and I can tell you now that I would have paid five times that amount back then if I knew how much I would have loved it.Other people have already explained the building system and the events system, so I won't really talk about those. What I would like to talk about, however, is the add-on creation system. Don't get me wrong, I truly enjoy building and eventing, but I wouldn't keep coming back to this game as often as I do if there weren't any add-ons. Not even just using add-ons though. More than that: creating them, changing them, collaborating on them. Even though some of the coding may be limited by the engine in this game, it more than makes up for this by flattening the learning curve for making your own mods. In my honest opinion, there are way more possibilities for creativity because of this. Because more people are making add-ons, there is a lot more diversity and plenty of originality when it comes to gamemodes, server mods, etc. The reason why I said ""at the very least, 2000 hours"", is because of all the time I've spent in text editors, writing code. That's actually the reason why you won't see many hours played on my steam account for Blockland, I'm in the midst of making a big gamemode (look for it, people of the future). This game is where I learned how to do basic logic constructions and other similar things for writing code. The language is called ""torquescript"", and it's pretty similar to C in most ways. It's incredibly easy to learn because of the syntax checker (to catch any mistakes you make), and because you can instantly see the result of your code ingame. Because of my previous experience with coding, I've been able to pick up visual basic and C almost instantly. For my job, I was able to program a z-axis camera mount using C# and also to make a protocol for an x-y motion system using a custom compiler for visual basic. I've included these in my resume, and next year when I leave for college there's no doubt in my mind that I will continue using code. In fact, it's very likely that my experience with code will have helped me get in the school of my choice (already accepted to one of my top choices).While I know this isn't necessarily something that everyone will experience if they play the game, I know I just wanted to share my story. Know that even if you have no interest in modding, Blockland has something for you. I've never seen, heard, or smelled of a game that could truly have ""endless possibilities"". That is, except for Blockland.			"

												I had the demo for this for a few years, and when I got the full version I was just so happy. So ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ happy. Then the steam release came, and I am OK with it, but new players, there used to be something called the ""Steam Apocalypse"", where many a blockhead will join random servers and screw up everything. Fear not, that's over, but my 3+ years of having this game and nearly mastering it, I can't say it's bad. Some say the physics is bad. And if you do... can you find the nearest gun and ammunition? THE PHYSICS IS THE BEST ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ THING EVER. It's what makes the Speedkart gamemode Speedkart. It's so hilarious nearly every time! The last thing I have to say: When trying to up your fighting skills, make sure you don't fight any experienced tryhards. Don't. Ever. Unless you're also an experienced tryhard, in which case, ♥♥♥♥ you! Go ahead and fight! I did get the steam version for free, because my Blockland key is older than the steam release. I don't play the steam version because my non-steam version has all my add-ons (basically mods except you don't need to download them to use them, except for textures, sounds, and music).			"

												Amazing game! I love to play multiplayer because there are so many things to do. You never need any friends to play because there's a bunch of strangers to play with and who doesn't like strangers?! You should definitely get this great game. Also, if you do get this game, play Crown's Jailbreak and Tezuni's Prison Escape they're extremely fun and pretty much the only reason I still play blockland. I guarantee that if you are a modder you will love this game. If not, it's still really fun just to see what other people made and play on other people's servers. If you do not get this game I will tell you to get it over and over until you do. This is by far the best game I have ever played. I rate Blockland 9.5/10. I hope this review was helpful, go get Blockland! Now! I mean it! RIGHT NOW! :D			"

It really is like playing with legos on the internet, but with the modding scene for this game, the game feels less like a game for 5-year olds and more for new scripters to get into coding, as it's extremely easy to make a bricks/gun/vehicle/light/effect and put it straight onto your server for people to see.The community right now is filled with a bunch of angsty teenagers who like to ddos for no apparent reason, but it really is rare to have your server ddos'd unless you anger the community that much.

												This game is mind-blowingly awesome. You want to abuse rapid firing rockets via an event system or just want to build a humble little home? Well, here's your solution.I reccomend the first thing you'd want to do is go to Start A Game and click on the Tutorial gamemode. Then start this game and make it singleplayer and follow the steps shown on screen.The game uses an easy to install add-on system, which is basically finding the Steam directory on your computer (Windows: Steam > SteamApps > Common > Blockland) and dragging and dropping your selected file into the AddOns Folder. I think this system will eventually be modded and changed to work with Steam Workshop like Garry's Mod. Once you have the right addons and knowledge of how to use them, the possibilities for a good server are endless.The building mechanics are very simple once you get the hang of them - simply using the numpad/your selected control scheme to maneuver the blocks into the right place and pressing Enter  when your ''Ghost Brick (Invisible brick you will see when you click the ground to move a block around) is above a support or another block. Then you can use the Paint Can (default key is E) to paint this block a selected colour.Physics-wise, this game is absolutely mad. If you think it's hilarious to have your car flung into oblivion then this game is definitely the one you want. This also kind of falls into the category of graphics. This game's visuals are not the best, but definitely better than Minecraft's. (Sorry Notch.)The game uses an eventing system which is a basic scripting mechanism. I think there should be a guide somewhere on the magic that is the Steam page, and that also tells you the rest about the game. Also, little LEGO guys.They're so cute.10/10 would build giant castle again.			"

												This is my favorite PC game of all time! If you like to build things, this is one of the best games you can get to do so. There are tons of things you can do in this game, like creating DMs, RPGs, racing builds, and sports arenas. You name it and you can probably build it! You can easily make the things you want to build with good building controls and a nice, clean user interface. Plus there is even a very useful event system that you can use, so you can turn a light switch on or off, create bots to interact with your build, and much, much more! People have also created a vast amount of mods that Blockland calls ""add-ons"", using the game's built-in mod support. The only real flaw of the game, would be some of the community if you ever decide to play the game online, but if you stick around the servers that have nice people on it, you can have a really good time making new friends and just having a blast fooling around! There are tons of other features that I haven't even mentioned and some vital add-ons that make this game a lot better like the Duplicator and the Fill Can. All in all, if you like to build with legos and like a game where you can do anything you want at any time, just click that buy button! If you are a bit skeptical about the game and you need to experience it firsthand before buying, there is a demo available on the official website (http://www.blockland.us). If you ever do get Blockland, you are free to add me on Steam as a friend so I can help ya out! :D			"

												Blockland describes itself as 'that game where you build stuff'. That's actually pretty accurate!ContentBlockland runs on an older version of the Torque Game Engine. It revolves around what are essentially legos, as the title implies. You control a small plastic figure called a 'blockhead', and the core element of the game involves placing bricks (with very intuitive controls) and then changing them with paint, emitters, or a simple programming system to create pretty much anything. There's support for add-ons and a weapon system, which opens possibilities for team deathmatches and any number of other gamemodes.PositiveThe controls. Blockland's movement and view controls are similar to any other 3D game - WASD to move, mouse to look, space to jump, so on, so forth. The build controls are almost as easy to use. Pressing a numpad key moves the brick in that direction, just like WASD; the corner keys move up and down or rotate the brick, and numpad 0 clears your 'ghost' brick (which shows where you're going to place it). This does take a day or two to learn well, but once you figure it out it's hard to think of a better way.Blockland also has decent multiplayer features, and involves a player-hosted server system. One of the core elements of the game is the fact that you're not just building stuff - you're all building stuff together. Servers can, by default, support up to 32 players; a workaround has been used to increase this to 99. The fact that servers are player-hosted removes most problems with lag; each individual server has to have a poor connection to be affected, instead of just one master server (there is, in fact, a master server, but it only keeps a list of all the servers players are hosting; IP connections can still be used).Bricks can be 'evented', or programmed, to do a number of things. The events system acts on a per-brick basis and is actually very easy to understand. You choose an input from a drop-down box - like onActivate (when the brick is clicked) or onPlayerTouch (more self-explanatory), then a target (Player, Client, Brick, Named Brick, etc.), then an action (setColor, Kill, playSound). For example - onActivate -> Player -> addVelocity(0, 0, 10) would make a ladder rung, when clicked, give the player a boost up. More than one event can be placed on a brick, and they can be delayed or even chained together with something called a relay.Finally, Blockland has an extensive add-on system that can be used to change almost any part of the game. New bricks can be added, or emitters, or colors, or events, or any other number of things. Even the GUI is open for change; the only rules are those that the programming language sets. The programming language is, however, slightly limited by the game's creator; this is mostly to avoid hacking or cheating, which are nigh-impossible without illegally modifying the game.NegativeFirst - the game carries the potential for what I call minecraft syndrome. You buy the game and just LOVE it; then you play it for several weeks or months and abruptly lose all interest. I first encountered this effect while playing Minecraft, hence the name; I used to play both games constantly, and now I haven't touched either of them for months for no apparent reason.Secondly, the game's community can be picky. Just mentioning Minecraft as above might get me some insults and complaints; half of Blockland's community is notorious for their hate of the games Minecraft and Roblox, the sole reason appearing to be that they're similar to Blockland (or vice verse). Also, the game has a website with a forum; there's a good share of good people as well as an impressive number of idiots that can be found there. The community isn't horrible, but it isn't the greatest I've seen, either.Finally, the game lost some of its former value with the v21 update. This update removed terrains and interiors - excellent parts of the game that allowed landscapes and buildings to be used as the scene for construction - in favor of shaders (like you might find in any other game) and bots (what it says on the tin). The game wasn't ruined, but it was definitely made worse. Terrains and interiors may return, and I hope they do, but having to build on an infinite flat plane shouldn't hinder your creativity!SummaryBlockland's features outweigh its flaws - while the community could be nicer and some recent updates are questionable, the game has a solid base and a good number of features to support it. Its support for add-ons and mods make almost anything possible, and there's already a great number of these out there. If you enjoyed building with legos as a kid, consider yourself a decent artist, need practice with programming, or just want a good way to have fun with your friends - this game is for you.			"

												PROS: - Gameplay is fun and simple - Numbpad brick placement is fantastic and easy to use - Multiplayer custom gamemodes and add-ons are endless - Character customization is easy and can make for some pretty hilarious character costumesCONS: - Graphics are not optimized for ♥♥♥♥ - Multiplayer Community is mostly dominated by cocky players (Hence, I said mostly) - Single-player can be boring. Otherwise there is no actual feedback from the game to the player.OVERVIEW:     I have played games like Roblox, Minecraft and Ace of Spades, and find joy in those games because of the community's creative standpoint, and Blockland is no exception. This game is the easiest one to pick up because it ACTUALLY HAS A TUTORIAL! (Which is still dumb because you have to load it up, there is no ""Tutorial"" button anywhere so you're left to find it yourself.) The controls are easy AND difficult. If you're used to FPS controls of switching through your weapons using 1, 2,  etc. Then prepare to be tricked as your bricks are assigned to your number keys while your weapons are located in your tools inventory by pressing Q (Or binded key). The numbpad can be used to move your bricks along a grid before placing them, which helps A LOT. Not a lot of sandbox, blocky games have this kind of feature and just makes Blockland much easier to play and enjoy. As for bricks, THIS GAME HAS A TON and more can even be added as add-ons, which by the way, is simple and easy to understand so you can install a plethora of mods made by the community. The Multiplayer in this game is really fun and most likely the only way you will play. The community is thriving through servers so meeting people in one place and finding them in another is pretty common and honestly feels nice because it feels like you are really getting to know the community and its players. As for Multiplayer gameplay, expect the normal Call of Duty like feedback from players. The occasional ""OMG stop playing like that!"" does turn up and its just as annoying. But if you're a troll and like screwing with players, then it should be no different than from how you troll on any other game. For the cons listed, I feel really upset that these are actually issues, because most of it can be easily simplified and fixed, fun-wise. The graphics are really up there in terms of quality. High graphics means your computer is somehow a beast because most high-end graphic cards can't run this game to its full potential. As for Singleplayer gameplay. Its just a simple complaint. This may be more of a personal standpoint so understand that this is mainly just a suggestion if anything. Singleplayer is NOT fun. It doesn't matter if you nuke entire maps of zombie NPCs. You will get bored of playing alone EASILY, and it is only because there isn't any actual user-friendly feedback coming from the game. I understand it's a singleplayer mode in a sandbox game, but even Gmod has a way of communicating with the player to make them seem like they are a part of the games world, immersing them into the game and grabbing their attention to want to continue playing.     This game is not bad, but your own fun has to be found in it, especially in the Multiplayer which can still give you a great taste of the game's actual feel. I do recommend this game, but it does feel like it can easily be put down.			"

												A great game which not only lets you build, but blow some stuff up with explosives.And yet, the addons assist us on making the game more fun.We know some rare addons are not listed.But heres a question if you respond.Would you rather...Yes : Install every addons you think will improve your serverNo : Be a total random collector and install random addons you will think improves the server's attention (but pretend you think it would if you do this).You can either rate or comment.---[Break #1]---Regardless.A backstory.""Imminum hosted a Renderman server not just a hunt, but a Survival which people find their own spot and survive there.Imminum's server got atleast 6/10 peoples attention worldwide.It was taking year in 2014 then.But then a twist occured.The attention got lower and lower, bringing less people.This got less entertaining.Until the year of 2015, it was gone.People searched for related servers to be entertaining.Imminum's server now ran into issues. He must fix them inorder to get the server back up.This now leads to a big problem to fix."" - Audio Log 24/06/2014 #3739172If you think you want to support this server.Do what you need to.---[Break #2]---This game inspires builders to create builds such as cities, towns, replicates, everything.But there are some battles over 2 games that have been a problem, causing people to quit blockland forever, and that is Undertale, and FNaF.Me? I'm not really much but I look forward for reactions, and when I heard people countering our attacks, I mentioned this.""The reason why we are doing this is because we do not want our community to die down because of all of this. I only like the game on itself but, this? I'm not really a fan of FNaF but we needed this because we do not want people to be forced to leave Blockland. As not to be offensive, I keep things seperate and try not to be really crashing servers. But, i'm sorry to those of you who like to have these servers on this game. We needed to do this because our community has been decreased.We do not promote any cyber-bullying for this. This is to keep both community outof each other. We are sorry for those of you who wanted to host just FNaF servers. We had to.I'm also finding some complaints over Undertale somehow, me?Well - I'm staying low for that."" - ImminumWhen I mentioned this, I looked forward for some regrets and agreements as our goal to bring back the Blockland community alive and live on!

												I got this game before the steam release, and I have played it for a number of years. This game is truely sandbox. It's very community-driven because of its ability to be modded. There are so many types of games in it, and the number is exploding with the steam community! The price dropped significantly with the steam release, and the game is still worth the old price. Get this game if you want to socialize, fight, build, roleplay, or anything!			"

												I dreamed about a game like this since I was a kid. Played this game since it was first freeware (2004); the upgrade to retail in 2007 was worth it. I'd have more hours on this than TF2, if I'd kept track before the Steam edition.This game taught me about art, scene design, project management, concepts of coding (events system and modifying game files), and teamwork; but the best part of it, was that I was just having a good old time building for TDM builds and helping out on RP servers.When large projects start to feel like work, I can always start a minigame in the city I'm building to ski away from dinosaurs, or hop on a public minigame server to vent some steam. The instant chaotic action of TDMs, boss-fights, and, more recently for me, Speed Kart racing, does the trick quite well (I used to hate the idea of racing; that is, until silly physics-gone-mad collisions were involved). When I'm feeling more dedicated, I'll team up on a CTF, dogfight, or trench war server to satiate my tryhard tastes.But when I get back to that big project, and it's finished, it's the greatest when others can appreciate and experience your creation by walking the halls. Or running down them. Away from bears with pistols akimbo.A note for new builders: don't be intimidated by screenshots of massive-crazy-project builds. Start with what you know or feel is right. Your ability to create what you imagine will improve over time, like any art form, and will be greater scaling with the amount of time you put into it, and how many friends you have for work division and support.I started this game quite young, and having people tell me something looked good or bad influenced me a lot (very common in that stage of development); but I learned to pay the most attention to those who gave reasoning. Find someone like that, or be that person for someone-- they matter the most.			"

												I've been playing this game since 2009, and I am so glad it made it to steam.In short, this game is Garry's Mod, but made out of bricks. Let your creativity run wild to construct cities, spaceships, and so much more. Have fun in in various minigames ranging from TDMs to City RPs. Events let you change the behavior of bricks, from changing colours when clicked to managing an item shop. This game's only limitation is truly its players' imagination. What is missing from the stock game can be found on the forums in the form of Add-Ons, which expand the game's content, by adding bricks, vehicles, weapons, gamemodes and a myriad of other miscellaneous improvements or changes.I'd recommend it to players who appreciate the sandbox genre and any lego fan.

												This game is one of the best I have ever played, and the best sandbox I have ever played.

The only people who voted it bad said ""OH MY GOSH ONLINE ISNT WORKING IT SUCKS"" and ""I CANT BUILD IT SUCKS""Building:You use the numpad. Unfortunately, this means that most laptops do not have the numpad, thus making it unable to build (who even PLAYS on laptops, anyway?)Online not working:1. Options > Networking2. Select custom then drag all the sliders as high as they can go3. Enable downloading sounds, models, ETC. except for UPiP (or whatever)BONUS:It says ""DEMO!"" Help!1. Options > Advanced options2.

												Okay, I've been playing the game since around 2007, while having varying interest in the game up until the present day. From version 9 and up, it was a great game, nearly everyone ♥♥♥♥ their pants when they heard about a new update because it brought new content to the table. Now it's rarely updated with versions that would constitute themselves more as a hotfix rather than anything else. We've arrived at the end of blockland's development and Badspot has practically lost all interest in the game. Is this a bad thing? For me, not really, seeing as there are always modders and mapmakers ready to enhance the game's experience. Let me tell you, there are many mods out there to suit your tastes, so I hope you'll never be bored with the different possibilities. As far as creativity goes, you can go all out and push the limits of the game if you have to. It's basic lego building but with the ability to not go out to your local toys r us and dropping 30+ on a set of legos. You can also play mini-games and other stuff in these worlds that you build.So to make things brief, the game is great. Go ahead and pick it up, it's only ~$10, try it out. If you don't like it, you didn't waste much.			"

It's  Garry's Mod[www.garrysmod.com] with Legos.. I hated that Badspot (Eric Hartman) removed maps. It was my favorite thing to do.

First of all, I'd like to start off by stating this game WILL get your ♥♥♥♥ hard, whether you want it to or not. Second of all, this game WILL ruin your life, again, whether you want it to or not. Prior to purchasing this on Steam I'd say I've racked up about 8,000 hours in this game, I've been playing since the pre-alpha of '03 and have loved every ♥♥♥♥ing aspect and feature added, from the UI to the custom servers, everything is just impecable. The UI is on a different level, it implemented designs that have been featured in trilogys such as Mass Effect and Crysis, this game has evolved the gaming generation that we see today. Unfortunately I'm going to have to cut this review short, just as I was getting into the swing of things my ♥♥♥♥ became hard again, it turns out it's that time of the day and I need to go shake it off with a nice sesion of custom CTF. makes me happy wet/10   thumbs up from me sheriff[www.exposay.com] "

I started playing back when it was in it's earliest stages around 2004 (Know as ""Vanilla Blockland"") You can build blocks with all of your friends online and do/make anything you want. The system for building is very comprehensive and efficient once you learn the controls. There's fun stuff like weapons and vehicles for all your death match needs. You can also code the blocks to do different things, like trigger stuff, move, emit particles or lights etc. Lots of options, little to no limitations. It's really amazing!

In Blockland you can do anything at all: play or make a team deathmatch, medieval rpg, zombie game, murder mystery, sports games, dogfight, portal, arcade games, prison escape, challenge, deathrun, racing games, farming rpg, city rpg, and infinitely more. I've been playing this game for years and it never gets old- something new is always coming out, and building + eventing is an extremely rewarding experience. This game is an awesome sandbox for people to build upon and come up with new game modes. Games should focus first on a fun gameplay experience, and Blockland manages this extremely well.

												My favorite building  game.  It's a bit like Garry's Mod in terms of installing third-pary Add-ons to enhance gameplay.  There's also a special scripting system for the more advanced players.  You'll get used to it.  Regardless, this is the best building game around that gives you so much freedom with mods and add-ons, unlike Minecraft which will commonly have errors.  If you don't know how to build, THEN FREAKING READ THE TUTORIAL, DAMN IT.			"

												Yes, Yes, And more, Yes.Blockland is one of the best games ive ever played. (Hence the 2400 hours i have)It may seem hard when you start but after say, 50 hours you get used to it.With the 2.4k hours i have im pretty good at both building and eventing.When you start you see all of these epic builds, But as you progress and get better, They become less epic until you can build and event way better. When i started i was like, Holy! Those are some good builds, Now im just like, I could do better.You can choose to try and be good at eventing or building, I chose eventing, Its why im not so good a builder, You can choose both but it results in being less good at both, I would reccomend this game to most people with a creative mind.Good luck if you get this!

												If you haven't got this game, you need to get it!! It is worth the money. Think of it like legos (somewhat similar to Minecraft and Roblox, but VERY different, do not ever compare these games together), you can build stuff with it with your own creative mind, like parks, buildings, wonders, and etc..This game has many types that you can add into this game, there is a add-on feature that is made in this game. So you may check it out if you like.In addition, I've hosted CityRPG, and CRP on my server in the past, And I will be hosting CRP again in Spring 2014, so keep an look out for that with me and my fellow administrators, Jasa, Knox, and Mistshadow, and the fellow staff team.

												Note: to see this review in it's true form (formating and screenshots) go to:http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/05/game-blockland.htmlBlockland is that game where you build ""stuff"". offten accused of being a copy of Roblox or Minecraft, Blockland is in fact it's own genre. its more of a Garrys Mod with blocks than a Minecraft clone. in fact Blockland came out in 2007 compared to Mincrafts 2010 release.Anyways like i said in Blockland you can build whatever you can image and build with blocks. i am not very good myself at building and creating but even then Blockland is fun. you can play gamemodes like Deathmatch using any weapon you want. even better Blockland has an ""event"" system that allows players to make extreme almost script like content.The best part of Blockland has to be the thousands of mods you can get for it on Return to Blockland, a mod within itself that lets you easily download addons for Blockland all most like Steam Workshop. what kind of addons? well all most anything, there are addons that add new bricks, addons that give you more weapons, addons that give you new things to drive, addons that give you different colors to use in builds, and addons that add gamemodes. some modders have added zombies and left for dead like gamemodes. there are racing game modes and plan old sandbox gamemodes.Blockland is uber fun with people online or even a LAN game. the problem is that Blockland seems to have network issues. regularly kicking you from games or even just not letting you join them. and as with Garry's mod if you join a server with addons that you don't have, getting them from the server will be a pain. i also wish Blockland had a voice talk ability in Multiplayer but that can be solved by using TeamSpeak or some such service.Blockland suffers from an outdated game engine know as Torque 3D. while the newest version of Torque itself is not bad Blockland uses the older version.the game did just get Shader support it came at the cost of Blockland maps. Maps had terrain and objects that where not made out of blocks. but because the Shader system could not support the maps they where removed. meaning the only way you can get terrain is if you build it out of blocks. not a problem for people good with the blocks and those with a good computer. because having that many blocks hits the Frame Rate pretty bad.In the end Blockland is a fun sandbox game that lets you do a lot of epic stuff. as long as your comptuer can handle it. it is in NO WAY a clone of Mincraft, Roblox, or any other block like game. if you enjoy games like Garry's Mod then Blockland will be perfect for you.

												I bought this via the recommendation of my friend on Steam. I was expecting something quite simple. But what I got, was a fountain of youth if you'll pardon the Expression. This game is the original Danish toy product that took Britain by storm (Lego).I've played for between 6-7 hours on it so far since I bought it. And it's the best fun I've had. I got it in a bundle of other games and so far it's been the one I've played the most and has distracted me from World Of Warcraft (Only slightly). If you like Lego and Building Blocks and enjoyed the original Roblox and other fun gametypes. You'll want to get this game ASAP. You won't regret it. I guarantee you			"

												I grew up playing the original alpha of this game, it was called Blockland v00002, lagged like a mofo and it was barely playable on my Pentium 4 PC. But, most importantly, it was fun.Then a bunch of years later, this game came out - and it is just absolutely amazing. Think of it as a sort of lego-builder's Garry's Mod. Sure, you've got your great building tools to make awesome ♥♥♥♥ with your friends in the default sandbox mode, within the limitations (it's still lego, so you can't have any floating bricks, for example), but apart from that, anyone can create new weapons, vehicles, and entirely new gamemodes with the game's scripting language (the uh, not terribly excellent TorqueScript).And the builds you make can be enhanced with event bricks, which are basically interactive bricks that'll react to say, a player walking on it, in ways that you define in the game with a simple system. Some dude made a playable pong using that, which is batshit crazy. And awesome.All in all, I can't find a good way to end this, because I'm not a writer, but I really, truly love this game, and I wish more people would play it with me.Game of the year, every year, 10/10.

												A HORRENDOUS FAILURE OF A GAME!!Okay, where do I begin?I guess I should say it's not the game that's cancer, its the community. Look on the game's official forum for proof. There is literally an ENITRE THREAD DEDICATED TOWARDS FLAMING OTHER USERS!!!Not only that, but you have many, many people (Kids and adults) that do NOT act thier age whatsoever. And with a large portion of the community having mental illnesses such as Autism, it can be very annoying at most times. (Im not saying people with a legitimate mental illness are bad, but they can be annoying without even knowing it)Now, there is some good with this game. The user-created content back from around 2010 still remains extremely popular today, and builds, bricks, weapons, and tools still remain extremely fun to mess around with today, in the game's single player. There are even brick add-ons that add even more actual LEGO blocks to the game!However, in conclusion, your $10 dollars would be MUCH better spent on a different game, perhaps one of the older GTA games? Or maybe a few case keys in CSGO?Or, best of all, you could take the $10 you were going to use on virtual Legos and go out to any old toy store and buy yourself some REAL Legos!It'd pry be more fun than this game anyways...

I recommend avoiding this. N//AI'll be honest, I can't give a detailed review because I haven't had a lot of experience with this game, and please take this into account, this is my experience as a newcomer to this game. I personally don't like recommending against games, but I recommend that people avoid buying this. I don't think this is a game worth buying, and starting now because the servers are almost dead. When I say almost, I mean I haven't seen it rise over 200 in the time I've owned it. It currently has 161 members across every server. Only 8 servers with more than 10 people in them (Their number ranges from 10-20), the rest consist of small numbers of people. And ignoring the overall player count, I haven't had a fun experience with the game. Not because it is a bad game, but it is an oudated one, and it isn't getting updated anymore. So you are left with a small community in a game that now has little to offer. The only popular servers right now are Role Playing servers, where you pretend to live alongside other players, and a few battle servers, but I don't enjoy these because of the ingame combat. There are also a few building servers with a few players in, but with the players ingame, I'd recommend getting a better where you are able to design and build.In this game, you start up, or join an already started multiplayer server. No disrepect to people who still enjoy to play the game with a friend, but I haven't had a great multiplayer experience in the larger servers. The players are active in chat, but I can never get into chat because it's just complaining, and arguing, and asking for a boyfriend etc. I'm not sure the age range of people still playing the game, but this has been my experience.

Revised 11/25/2015:Good game, ♥♥♥♥ tier community and servers.The building and movement controls are oddly satisfying for a game of its genre, featuring a myriad of bricks to build with, and a robust add-on system allows for infinitely more game content than what the vanilla game offers.However, the community's been taken over by little children and decent servers are difficult to come by. Your best bet is to get some of your friends to buy this game (if they don't already have it this is) and hang out with them on a private server where you can ♥♥♥♥ around without interference from unwanted visitors.TL;DR: Don't get this game unless you have friends who also have it.

												Blockland has been around for a long time, and has sadly been burried. People still play, but it lost so much popularity. It's a fun sandbox building game where you can build and program anything. The way you build stuff is very similar to real-life LEGOs, where you are not allowed to have floating bricks. The law of gravity is impossible to break. You can still make bricks float by making invisible and walk through towers under a brick. You can press the left mouse button to activate your jets so you can fly around. There's a spray can that allows you to not only paint bricks, but give them special effects such as rainbows and also make bricks transparent. You start with three tools; a hammer, a wrench, and a printing gun. The hammer lets you break bricks you put, but you can't break bricks under another brick unless the brick you want to destroy won't cause the other bricks above to float in the air. You can type /wand to get a wand that acts just like a hammer, but if you destroy a brick that would cause any bricks above it to float, everything above it breaks also. The wrench lets you do many different things with your bricks. While holding the wrench, you can click on a brick to view its properties. You can make your brick emit fire, or smoke, or any other particle that's in the game. You can spawn more tools, like a sword or a gun, or something that'll help you build better things. You can also program your bricks with events. Events are super easy to learn. I made a basic Windows XP computer with very little knowledge of events when I was a noob, and the results were satisfactory! The properties will be different depending on the brick you select. For example, if I use the wrench on a vehicle spawner, I won't have the ability to make it into a spear giver. I can only select from a list of rideable objects. If I use the wrench on a music brick, I will be able to choose from a list of music for it to play. The printer gun lets you put pictures on printer bricks. It's useful for making signs for things like stores, or for cooler security systems. Building in Blockland is lots of fun! You can also download add-ons that other users made from other websites so you can get more content such as more guns and swords to blow up everyone, or tools to help you build better things. I hope Steam workshop comes out for this game soon so it'll be quicker to download and find add-ons. Blockland also has a minigame feature which lets you disable and enable certain fuctions such as building or jets and allow players to get points for doing certain tasks. With add-ons, you can enhance your minigames and make them even more fun to play with your friends. You could make a futuristic team deathmatch minigame, or a survival horror game using the popular Renderman add-on based on the legendary Renderman! This game has endless possibilities, and I am really sad to see it die like this. I mean it. I am literally sad. After the extremely popular Return to Blockland add-on was gone, many people started to give up on this game. Return to Blockland made Blockland more social by adding private chat (much like Steam's chat), friends, and the ability to join your friend in a server they are playing. It didn't just make Blockland a better game to play it friends. It gave you better admin tools. It allowed you to download add-ons very similar to how Steam workshop works. Many add-ons lost some functions because they depended on RTB. The Renderman add-on was one of them. You can't control when he spawns anymore. I will always remember how much fun Blockland was. R.I.P. one of my favorite sandbox games ever.			"

												Blockland is an epic game. Basically you can build anything you want, without anyone having to tell you what to do. You can play alone or play with friends. This game is like roblox except better. The animations and effects are good and you don't lag so much in game. In Blockland, you don't need any type of game money used to buy things for your avatar or something. I recommend Blockland, it's good game for anybody.			"

												The game is great when you have enough people playing local, but most of the regular multiplayer is too laggy to be fair. But don't get me wrong, this game is still tons of fun! Similar to Garry's mod, it is easlily added on to, there are goals only set by the players, and there are TONS of halarious moments.First, I want to start with the gameplay.It is about as rock solid as the game will ever get. Blockland appeals to a broad audience through it's open ended ways of playing. For instance, you can build if you are into creativity. Lets say that you don't care for building, that is not a problem. You could join a multiplayer kart race, deathmatch or some other original gamemode that Blockland could boast. The only thing bogging this part down is the slow multiplayer connections and the TERRIBLE physics. And by TERRIBLE, I mean if you hit somebody with a car just right, or should I say wrong, you could in fact get a one way ticket to the statosphere. (Then again, it's not exactly bad when it happens to your friend, in fact that's halarious). If you have a good internet connection, then this game's multiplayer will appeal to you.Well, I don't really have another category to cover so...Pros-* Been around for 7 years, still active updates (sorta).* Easy to mod* Fun Multiplayer* Creative Structure* Solid, refined gameplay concepts* I have had no problems with the community so far* Good graphics for a block game.* Makes halarious moments with or without friends aroundCons-* The physics can be beyond bad.* Bad multiplayer connections.* Did I mention the physics?* Setting up a multiplayer server is brutally hard. (not really their fault)(EDIT: I found a few more)*The public multiplayer has the worst community you will ever witness.*Lack of ambition (The game feels like it's becoming more and more abandoned each day)In my opinion, this game is solid enough to achieve a 8.9/10Im sure people will like it, but DEFINETLY NOT everyone.But for only ten dollars, it's one of the greatest user created content games that predates minecraft.

												despite its relative look to roblox and minecraft blockland is really a jewl of its own, players use blocklands skeletal structure to make interesting gamemodes and items, even though the playerbase is small, its enjoyable in its own unique sense. I have found blockland to be more addicting and fun than even some of the top AAA games. If you want a game which will last you a long time then this is it!			"

												Great game. I cannot stand in games where building is hard but here it is relatively easy. This has a mature community some how, but do not go on the forums if you are ready for it. Graphics is just a simple adjustment, I recommend minimun because it gives you more shine than no shaders and because it doesn't shade in areas where there are roofs. Making add-ons is a toughy. This game uses the Torque engine and I only make simple edits. If you want to create add-ons you need coding knowledge. Over all I give this a ten out of ten.			"

												This game has pushed it's limits.The Whole blockland universe is came to it's limit, i used to Love this game but i am questioning myself about this game, First off the vehicle physics is funny as hell, but it messes things up,the vehicle physics is out of control when it comes to doing a roleplay perfectly, or filming a movie for blockland, and most Active is SpeedKart, I love this game but it's not good anymore,Because of how hard people work and i work just to play this and build in it, Alot of people are rude and they grief you, Specially badadmins, This game has became the 50th game likebecause it's not in much use anymoreThis game is good and all but... one problemThis game has server problems, vehicle physics, And the brick limitThe brick limit is annoying because, Imagine your building a huge city, you hit the brick limit then you have to probably wipe it.I Cannot deal with all this stuffSo as blockland players,Badspot if your reading this, you need to add a workshop where people won't have to download it on the forums and the Shut down RTB, the forums contains viruses in some addons and plus this game needs to be updated alot, because all this bull that happens and just Awful.This game litterally needs to be updated alot, and a workshop.Do you agree with me?Should badspot add more updates with more bricks and features and a workshop?

												3 Words.Best, Game, Ever!I loved this game ever since I got it! Yes, I did have a couple of problems with the fact that there was a ""Block Limit"" everytime I launched my own Internet Freebuild server. It bugged me a lot. But then somehow it got fixed, and I have no idea how but it just did. I love playing on the servers as well. In the future, I will be starting a YouTube channel and this game will become one of my series with 2 other of my friends. It will be so much more fun!1 Request: Can you make the game a little more ""Organized"" in a way?Like, The Blockland forums arent really helpful, so get the Steam Workshop up and running!That would be so much easiser.Otherwise, I rate this 5 out of 5 stars! :D-DerpyBanana-SwagaDerp			"

												This is easily one of the best sandbox games i have ever played. it gives you both single and multiplayer, it has endless building fun, and tons of game modes for you to try out.The single player doesnt offer too much, you can build, there is also a tutorial, and a few other game modes (that were meant for multiplayer). The multiplayer however, offers A LOT with tons of RP, carting, building, and war servers. there are also a few other fun game modes but are not use so much on multiplayer such as ""blockheads destroy christmas"".The downside is that the graphics are WAY out of date, and the vehicle mechanis are also pretty bad. there are also quite a few  dead servers, but other than that, this game is extremely fun.PS this is not like minecraft, but more like if they made legos into a game.

												Best game I have ever played. People may say the community is bad, which may be true, but if you're still a little kid you could just turn the cuss filter on. I personally would rather have this community compaired to Minecraft or Roblox, or maybe even Gmod. It's just the way a lot of games are.Anyways, here's why I recommend Blockland;•You could build anything - It's like having infinite amount of every color of legos (which I always wished was a thing :c)•Lots and lots of add-ons! You could get anything from cars to doors, to gamemodes (including Super Murder Mystery, which is my all time favorite. This gamemode includes a few players who are in the mafia, who have to kill everyone else.)•Small community, meaning a better chance of running in to the same person multiple times, helping you make friends.TL;DR, Awesome game, little kids just keep your swear filter on. Best game I've ever played.Over all, I'd rate this game 9.5/10.			"

												I have played this game on and off since 2007. One of the coolest things back in the day was being part of a building clan. For the most part, those days are over with the exception of a few withstanding groups. However, the community (at least most of it) is still very good, and I'm sure new subcommunities will form with an influx of new people. The possibilities in this game are literally endless, especially with the advantage of the RTB Mod, which allows you to access a database of add-ons for your game as well as communicate with others who are currently in the game. It takes a bit of patience to master the controls, but success comes through persistence (though persistantly asking for admin in a server will get you kicked!!!).I can't wait to see what's in store for Blockland as far as new game-modes, mods, and people!

												[ Introduction ]:Blockland is a mix between Roblox (non-steam) and a bit of Garry's Mod, therefore looking and playing like a ""Roblox done right"".The idea of the game is great: allowing players to build things with LEGO blocks and host their own servers with different game types. For further customization and setting of servers, Blockland also presents a simple enough Eventing System (simplified scripting) allowing the user to affect the entities, game client or the game running in the server.[ Positive Points ]:- Freedom of creation: For those who like to create and host servers, there is a great deal of freedom in the game, allowing anyone to create and host an unique server.- Easy to learn and get started.- DIfferent gametypes, that varies from Freebuild to Kart Races (with or without guns), Team Deathmatchs, CityRPGs, Empire (Civilization-like mini-games) and more.[ Negative Points ]:- As expected, the worst part of the game is it's community, probably composed by many children (or brain-damaged young adults and adults). Some very annoying and immature/offensive/pornographic stuff is said on the chat in any server. Even some servers Admins/Moderators are stupid and may get into the way of the players (derping in the middle of a firefight, standing in the middle of a road during a race, etc). - Also as expected due to the large amount of stupid members, many people don't know how to read, don't bother or are simply trolls, and dedicate themselves in annoying others. Stupid players also ruin RP games, like ""Super Murder Mystery"" (Blocklands' Trouble in Terrorist Town counterpart), turning most RP games into TDMs with lots of RDMing. Many mods and admins do their best to keep their servers clean, but any player will see this happening many times.- Buggy and laggy collision physics on vehicles, make some game modes very annoying or take much fun away.- Build mode can be very boring to work with when using a laptop without a numpad.- Little number of players and servers (from my experience).[ Conclusion ]:If you can get past the annoying community, there's fun to be had in Blockland. Switching between game modes and the shared simplicity of the games is very fun. Forming up a group of friends to play on a self-made server is also a great idea.I'm pretty sure that Garry's Mod would be a better option, but still, Blockland has it's own vibe to it to make it worth a try, so try the Demo from the official site before buying.

												The story of an ex-convict recently released from prison, out to get revenge on his oppresive captors. He does this in various ways; Petty vandilisim, assault, Pirate Ship Deathmatchs, etc. The game requires an intellectual approach to its many secrets and story branches.You must be patient with this game, as dying is something that will happen regularly and unexpectedly. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys story-rich games, with a deep narrative and a rich backdrop that immerses you completely. Upon starting the game, you will be greeted with some of the best graphics currently available to the gaming industry. However this is only a small part of the fun and excitement Blockland delivers.10/10 Would buy again.			"

												Cool game, don't get me wrong, but it's just dead. There are about 100 players playing it at a time. Its hard to find a server over 10 players. However, you can still find enjoyment in it, but it can be difficult and I'm still deciding myself if it was worth it. I'm sure that this game was more popular a few year backs. Sadly, it faded away though. I wish it could come back because it has great potential. If your not intrested in the multiplayer though, I would still get it.			"

												This game is really great and fun. It's pretty much like legos, but a computer game. Building is harder at first, but once you learn the basics you can build anything with ease. This game is kind of boring alone, so be sure to play with some friends. Online the game is a little dead though...Game overall is 9/10. Reminds me of when I used to play with legos.			"

												I have had this game for a long long time. At least 6 years. And that time was well spent. Building may seem to take forever but it allows for custom brick to be used or events, which is like scripting in ways. Its like legos but more funs in some ways. I may seem biased but there are games I have bought and hated. Atleast try the game out for a few hours and don't be an idiot when talking to people. Blid:15925			"

												Blockland is a complete Roblox killer. And I'm not saying that it's bad. It's a MUST GET. Blockland is a sandbox game (just like Garry's mod) where you create things with blocks. I know that may sound strange, kinda like Legos in a way. But that doesn't end there. There's addons (oh boy, you saw this one coming didn't you.). You can grab new addons from the Blockland Forms or RTB. Just look it up on google m8. And slap on those addons to the Blockland addon folder. Now you got more blocks! ......what's that? Weapons? Vehicles? Oh so this is like Garry's mod. Lovely! Yes, there are weapons and tools for you to build or fight in custom mini games. Vehicles for you to race against your friends, so much more to play with! Hmm, if this is like Garry's mod...is there game modes? Yes, yes there is. From Speedkart to Xmas to Tutorials to anything really, you can download more on the forms and RTB. You can even customize your own character too. Well, that wraps up what I'm gonna say about this game. I highly recommend you get this game to fulfill your creativity. It's way better than Roblox ya heard?			"

												I don't have any previous history of the game before it came to Steam, and really don't care about some of the politics that surround the title.  My opinions are based on my play experiences.  I don't think it's fair to compare this to LEGO in anyway.  The blocks in the game do not go together in the ways that real LEGO bricks do.  For example I never found a way to change the direction of studs (SNOT building).  And the selection of blocks is very minimal without installing a bunch of extra mods or add-ons.In fact, the game seems to require a certain amount of user-created material to be something other than demo or alpha quality.  So if you're just looking for a fun out-of-the-box experience, look elsewhere.			"

												The game is over-all a great game, I've been playing it since 2010. Yet I still can't necessarily reccomend it due to the lack of a friendly community. Everyone is a bit uptight and an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I would only buy it if you were to only play with friends. But over-all, don't buy it if you're looking forward to online mulitplayer, you will be dissapointed by it's lack of a friendly community. I was banned from 3 servers for going against their rules because they were completely ridiculous and trivial. I was once banned for asking if anyone was going to be a pain in the ♥♥♥, the reason was because the host thought I outsmarted him (which I did) and made him look like a complete fool infront of his friends. I was again banned for griefing a game after I was disrespected several times for being polite and ""acting like the king of England"". This game is great, but for the love of god, avoid online multiplayer, only play with friends, you'll be much happier if you do that.			"

												This game ate up my afternoons before the Steam release. This game is probably one of the best sandbox building block games I've played, probably even the best sandbox game I've played period. The base game has a ton of content, but mods add even more and I'm sure there's a mod for everyone. Multiplayer is fantastic with a huge variety of player-made gamemodes as well as a fun-loving, yet mature community. The visuals look gorgeous (Especially with shaders on.), the physics are a treat to see (Especially if you blow up a building made up entirely of small blocks.) and each server level has a completely different atmosphere. I absolutely love this game and I recommend you get it if you love sandbox games and the Lego-filled memories of your childhood.			"

												I've owned this game for six years and I can say that when I reach absolute boredom with all of the garbage-tier AAA titles that come out this is my first fallback.  There's always something to do whether it be building an elaborate city by myself, entering a trench TDM and completely dominating, or sitting enjoying my time with others. This game had so much potential when I first played it, and now I'm seeing these potentials become real game elements. The mod development group cranks out new stuff almost by the minute.  I've even released stuff myself. It's also really optimized and could literally be played on your grandmother's computer.I'm really impressed with everything Badspot has done with Blockland. I would guess he is probably swamped with things to do since this game has blown up on Steam, but he still takes the time to engage the community.

Yes, it may seem like Roblox's evil cousin or a Minecraft rip-off or whatever, but it has one thing each of those doesn't; A fun-loving and creative community. Each modder is a valuable member of the community, infact; a lot of dedicated people (regular everyday gaming people) have been recruited into the staff more often than you may think.People will play this for a few weeks, not like it, and turn it down. Which is fine, this game may not be for everyone, but the reason this takes a while to get used to is because there's really no other game like it. It's like stepping into high school for the first time. It's different. Yes, every game has it's share of bad sports, trolls, and idiots, but once you look into the community and spend some time to master the controls, you can literally do anything you want. This game is a First Person Shooter, Role-Playing Game, Arcade Game, and so much more. And for those of you who have already given up on the game, I ask you to give it one more shot, to spend time to know how to work the game, and really let your imagination go wild. Everything you see in the photo previews were all built by humans who started out in your shoes. There is really no limits. Every statement where people say ""If you can imagine it, you can build it"", are all true.			"

												Create your own buildings using bricks.Engage in multiplayer battles that take place in a vivid block world.Interact with gamers all over the globe and compete or cooperate.Block games have received quite a lot of popularity since Minecraft appeared 5 years ago. The market is actually invaded by a lot of games that look like similar just to capitalize on its success, but in order to be successful in the gaming world you do need to be innovative, and that’s what Blockland tries to deliver. This is basically a game where you can use bricks to create the game world in any way imaginable.Since Blockland is an online game at heart, you will have to rely on other people to create the game world how you want, or each player can create its own region and defend it against the attackers.There are also some situations or game modes in which you won’t build anything, since the world is already built. Instead, you will have the opportunity to explore the world and defeat the other persons you encounter, while also avoiding zombies and other NPC creatures. The possibilities really are endless in this game and most of the time the people that play it will choose what to do and where to go, since there are literally no restrictions whatsoever, and that is truly important.While the buildings in Blockland don’t seem to be affected by gravity or physics, you do have the option and tools to create a world that is very realistic and unique.The controls in the game are very solid and they give you a great feeling and appeal, which is surely important. Furthermore, you also have a lot of multiplayer systems into the game, including a player hosted server system which allows players to develop their own world and invite their friends to play.Bricks can be created for a certain event or programmed and there’s even a unique add-on system that really makes the game shine. The community for this particular title is rather large, much larger than you would expect and, of course, there are some situations in which you are not welcome to the server.Even so, with the help of the forum and numerous other additions, Blockland does offer a lot of ways to communicate, including the in-game chat. This makes the game a very good one for kids that want to be creative and come up with something of their own.Blockland is the crowning achievement of the block game mania, as it delivers all the tools needed by the gamers to create their own worlds out of blocks. Yes, it will surely eat up a lot of your time, but in the end the game is well worth your time, since it has so many features and things you can do in it. Replayability is at its best here and it’s guaranteed that no two sessions will be the same. It’s surely much more than you could hope for, and we certainly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in block building games.			"

												I used to play Blockland back WAY before it was Greenlit. It's still fun to this day, but if you want to play Blockland, keep a few things in mind:1. The community has gone on a bit of a decline. Blockland has many jerks in it, but it's still much better to play multiplayer. If you want to play Blockland, persuade some friends to get the game as well.2. The base game alone is somewhat bland. You can still do many things, but it's MUCH better with add-ons! Just look up how to get add-ons, and you'll find plenty of guides!			"

I also got it for $19.99, so you steam users now get a permanent 50% discount! Plus for the next while it is 33% off from that, so you are getting Blockland 83% off!In any event, this game charmed me through the first many years of my gaming, this was probably the first actual multiplayer-based game I ever bought, and it even helped me learn programming with the VCE addon allowing advanced mechanics in your beautiful build!DO IT!

												Can't recommend it enough. I've played this on and off since 2008. Aside from building, there is always something new.The modding community is huge. Hell, the game practically revolves around it. Vanilla is nice, but any server you join is going to have lots of mods. From Team Deathmatches, to racing, to prison escapes, to building with some friends, there are many things to keep you busy.Development is always active, and with the new launcher introduced in Version 19, they're applied automatically and more frequently. There are always new content updates and bug fixes every once and a while. It's been like this for years, and doesn't seem to be slowing down.The graphics are good for a sandbox building game, but what more could you want right? Shadows and shaders have been a nice addition in Version 21, and anyone with a non-intergrated graphics card can at least run them on minimum. The game isn't very demanding at all. Aside from the studs, the bricks looks and act like your classic Lego blocks, and the minifigures have a nice, original design to them.In a nuthshell, this game is practically G-Mod in the style of Legos. And it can't get any better than that. If you're still unsure, there's a demo you can download to try out the game and mechanics yourself - aside from multiplayer. For an indie game that only costs twenty-dollars, you get a lot more than your money's worth.			"

It has an extensive modding support, an event system allowing you to easily script almost anything right in the game and flawlessly working multiplayer. Loads of mods available,  hundreds of bricks for downloads, thousands creations you can build (and blow up with rocket launcher afterwards).			"

It's a bit of a nuisance, but overall the game is superb.

												(9.2) Blockland is not just one of those generic, lego-style sandbox type of game. Blockland is different in every aspect, foremost with the community. This game has no boundaries, especially with the use of mods. You cannot undermine this game for its lego-style approach, because beyond that you have unraveled limitless, unique possibilities that could be expressed through many game styles and modes. The well-sized and expanding community is helpful and the developer does a superb job at connecting with his players. As well, it features TorqueScript, an easy scripting language. It's super-cheap for its value! My final premise on this title: This is an uncomparable, well-developed sandbox that is a definite must-buy for its pricing and community.  "

There is so much to do and/or create with Blockland. If you had a passion for Legos as a child, you might enjoy this game... a lot. It has the building mechanics of Legos, with the gameplay and versatility of Garry's Mod. The only setback for this game's potential is the community. There are always good people, but the majority seem to be pretty immature, but it's kind of expected for the type of game. Overall, I think it's a great game to have. It's very fun to play with friends! Also, feel free to check out my basketball server if you decide to buy.			"

There is so much to do and/or create with Blockland. If you had a passion for Legos as a child, you might enjoy this game... a lot. It has the building mechanics of Legos, with the gameplay and versatility of Garry's Mod. The only setback for this game's potential is the community. There are always good people, but the majority seem to be pretty immature, but it's kind of expected for the type of game. Overall, I think it's a great game to have. It's very fun to play with friends! Also, feel free to check out my basketball server if you decide to buy.			"

												(9.2) Blockland is not just one of those generic, lego-style sandbox type of game. Blockland is different in every aspect, foremost with the community. This game has no boundaries, especially with the use of mods. You cannot undermine this game for its lego-style approach, because beyond that you have unraveled limitless, unique possibilities that could be expressed through many game styles and modes. The well-sized and expanding community is helpful and the developer does a superb job at connecting with his players. As well, it features TorqueScript, an easy scripting language. It's super-cheap for its value! My final premise on this title: This is an uncomparable, well-developed sandbox that is a definite must-buy for its pricing and community.  "

												This game is the ♥♥♥♥ man. I have played this game for 6 years now, and it has alot of things to do. Roleplays, Team Deathmatches, Capture the Flag, you name it! You can decide what to do or what to build, perhaps go to a battle server and fight against other people? Tired of the servers? Why not make your own! It has full port forward support, so no need for that cluttery mess! You can create nearly anything, and thats not it. Blockland has its own unique Event system, where you can easily configure stuff. If you still have no idea what kind of game this is, i'll tell you. It has the creativity of minecraft, a very complicated event system, what is a bit like redstone, but alot newbie-friendly. I absolutely recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Ah this is such a great game. I've had this game for over 5 years and put in over 1000 hours into it before it came to steam, it's the best sandbox game I've ever played because there is just so much you can do. I may have been just a kid when I first bought this game, but it is still amazing, I would reccommend this game over Garry's Mod because of it's great build system, gamemodes, and events system, which allows you to manipulate items and do amazing things. For a simple example, if you use events on a block, you could make it so that by touching the block you go flying into the air with your butt on fire. There are numerous possibilities with this game, it's simeoultaneously a FPS shooter, a 3rd Person Shooter, a racing simulator, a Dogfight simulator, a Quake-Like Deathmatch arena, a City RPG, a Jail RPG, and anything you can possibily think of. This is all thanks to the numerous enjoyable addons created by the community such as different gamemodes and addons. Very very underrated for it's quality as a game. People try to compare this game Roblox and then subsequently judge it based on that terrible game, but this should not be the case, because first of all it was created long before Roblox, second it has a much better community, third it has a much better building system, and fourth it has much more possibilities in terms of addons, gamemodes, and maps.

												Alrighty, review time I guess.. I have been playing this game since early 2011. I've spent hours, building basic houses, making event builds, shooting guns, and so on. Pros and Cons time!Pros ------------------------------------------------------------------Lots of people on it everyday.Prebuilt saves.Moddable. (very much)Tons of addons EVERYWHERE.Cons -----------------------------------------------------------------No maps. There used to be, back in v20. This ""Enviroment"" is basically a cheap knock-off of Adjustable Plate on BL. (How I know? Used to have a map collection in v20.)Gets a bit repititive on Custom.Random raging kids (rarely I see them).-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, I'm gonna give this game 8/10. It's really good. I miss maps so much. If you got 10 bux, get this game.			"

												Blockland Is a great game. It's a virtual sandbox that combines the community mods of Gmod with the building style found in LEGO brick along with some decent lighting! The thing is, our community is dying. We need numbers (players)  now more than ever to bring this game out of an unfotunately impending demise. I paid for this game back when it was 20 US dollars, and even at that price, I believed my money was well spent. Thsi game has given me some  good experiences and great friends over the 4 years I have played it. I can't possibly recommend it enough. We just need more players to bring fresh, creative ideas back to the game. If you're still uncomfortable to pay the 10 US dollars, just wait for a sale, then the purchase will definitely be worth it.			"

												Now, dont get me wrong. I LOVE this game, but with the influx of 5 year olds and the fact that Badspot (the game's developer) said that he wasn't updating the game further, it's gone down in quality. As far as servers go, you MIGHT find a good one here or there, but its mostly bad roleplay servers run by abusive admins.But if you can get passed all that, it's a GREAT game. But I wouldn't recommend it to newcomers.			"

												A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far away, Eric ""Badspot"" Hartman casually experimented with the idea of making a lego-oriented game with the Torque Engine. You place lego bricks in a voxel world, drive brick cars, shoot weapons, destroy bricks with hammers, ski down slopes, etc... The kinds of things most kids like to imagine doing with legos.Today, the game has reached new heights compared to its early years. The creative side of Blockland has gone to new extremes with their endeavors. When you first enter the game, you might be disoriented at first. There is no direction; you just place and edit bricks, among other things. But stick around and explore, and the rewards will be greater every time. Build a house or other structure of your choice. Then build another; then another, and another. Improve your technique, and watch your skills improve as your builds become more elaborate and more detailed, realistic, and higher quality.Make the bricks do things with the Wrench Event system, whereupon you might begin crafting brick-event computers and contraptions, sci fi setups, RP games, and countless other possibilities yet to be explored...Explore online servers and see what the other players are doing; of all the things you might find, locally famous examples include: A 1:1 scale exact detail replica of the RMS Titanic, giant six-story spaceships, high-detailed yachts, realistic houses both vintage and modernesque, science labs, roleplay worlds, giant dragonflies, arenas, etc...  you'll find many visual examples of Blockland creations through this link: http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=247866.0, the Blockland trailor, and of course on online servers.The game's add-on system is among the most prominent features of the game. You might consider searching out and downloading custom bricks, vehicles, tools, gamemodes, events, etc as well to enhance your potential. Most add-ons may be found in the Add-ons section of the Blockland forums.In all, this game will be well worth the money if you stick around and explore the possibilities. The game's path is yours.-----PS: Before you step in, beware: The Blockland community is, in general, exceptionally... er... badly influenced. There are nice people out there, but it is advised that you use your own judgement to find them, and beware that dwelling too long in the general sea of the Blockland Forum and many Blockland internet servers, your sanity may be at risk. I urge you not to let this effect your impression of the game itself.			"

												Great game. I love sandboxes, this is better than Minecraft. Why? So much more creativity is involved, so many more possibilities, events arent frustrating like redstone can be (most of the time), adding mods/addons is SO much easier than Minecraft, and it is just a great game. Feels like Legos. You can make your own gamemodes using minigames, and with so much space you can build anything. Buy da game. It is worth ten dollars. Bots are so fun, too.

Like metor,flood and a wild dragon? Metors is falling metors that cause explosions,flood is where if you stand in water a shark will chase you there are 5 sharks in the flood and the flood cause brick wobbling that they fall down and if you were on top on that brick then you should know what happens and the wild dragon hunts down players.Better movements and deaths?Last: Amazeing you just need new gamemodes, falling bricks and more sounds.

												I would recommend this game, but do NOT buy on steam, you can't get addons or saves, or special things like that. I lost my old account, got it on here for the sale, and it is the worst version EVER. So do yourself a favor and buy it on the blockland website.Edit: My friend showed me how to get addons. It's just harder. And I forgot how. D:			"

												Ahh Blockland....I started playing this beauty in 2010, next to Majora' Mask its the best thing ever. Building is straight forward and incredibly easy. The game is also in expensive. Remember how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Roblox was and how we all wanted to punch it in the face? Well not anymore! Everyone can build large buildings that do cool stuff! The scripting system is simple and you can create some cool contraptions! Plus it actually has a community! For the best experience get RTB.			"

												Alrighty, review time I guess.. I have been playing this game since early 2011. I've spent hours, building basic houses, making event builds, shooting guns, and so on. Pros and Cons time!Pros ------------------------------------------------------------------Lots of people on it everyday.Prebuilt saves.Moddable. (very much)Tons of addons EVERYWHERE.Cons -----------------------------------------------------------------No maps. There used to be, back in v20. This ""Enviroment"" is basically a cheap knock-off of Adjustable Plate on BL. (How I know? Used to have a map collection in v20.)Gets a bit repititive on Custom.Random raging kids (rarely I see them).-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, I'm gonna give this game 8/10. It's really good. I miss maps so much. If you got 10 bux, get this game.			"

												Blockland Is a great game. It's a virtual sandbox that combines the community mods of Gmod with the building style found in LEGO brick along with some decent lighting! The thing is, our community is dying. We need numbers (players)  now more than ever to bring this game out of an unfotunately impending demise. I paid for this game back when it was 20 US dollars, and even at that price, I believed my money was well spent. Thsi game has given me some  good experiences and great friends over the 4 years I have played it. I can't possibly recommend it enough. We just need more players to bring fresh, creative ideas back to the game. If you're still uncomfortable to pay the 10 US dollars, just wait for a sale, then the purchase will definitely be worth it.			"

												A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far away, Eric ""Badspot"" Hartman casually experimented with the idea of making a lego-oriented game with the Torque Engine. You place lego bricks in a voxel world, drive brick cars, shoot weapons, destroy bricks with hammers, ski down slopes, etc... The kinds of things most kids like to imagine doing with legos.Today, the game has reached new heights compared to its early years. The creative side of Blockland has gone to new extremes with their endeavors. When you first enter the game, you might be disoriented at first. There is no direction; you just place and edit bricks, among other things. But stick around and explore, and the rewards will be greater every time. Build a house or other structure of your choice. Then build another; then another, and another. Improve your technique, and watch your skills improve as your builds become more elaborate and more detailed, realistic, and higher quality.Make the bricks do things with the Wrench Event system, whereupon you might begin crafting brick-event computers and contraptions, sci fi setups, RP games, and countless other possibilities yet to be explored...Explore online servers and see what the other players are doing; of all the things you might find, locally famous examples include: A 1:1 scale exact detail replica of the RMS Titanic, giant six-story spaceships, high-detailed yachts, realistic houses both vintage and modernesque, science labs, roleplay worlds, giant dragonflies, arenas, etc...  you'll find many visual examples of Blockland creations through this link: http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=247866.0, the Blockland trailor, and of course on online servers.The game's add-on system is among the most prominent features of the game. You might consider searching out and downloading custom bricks, vehicles, tools, gamemodes, events, etc as well to enhance your potential. Most add-ons may be found in the Add-ons section of the Blockland forums.In all, this game will be well worth the money if you stick around and explore the possibilities. The game's path is yours.-----PS: Before you step in, beware: The Blockland community is, in general, exceptionally... er... badly influenced. There are nice people out there, but it is advised that you use your own judgement to find them, and beware that dwelling too long in the general sea of the Blockland Forum and many Blockland internet servers, your sanity may be at risk. I urge you not to let this effect your impression of the game itself.			"

												I've wasted plenty of hours on this game because of Tezuni's Prison Escape server, I went from a normal user to a mod over a long period of time. Hell, it's still great too.Also, as for other game modes and servers. You're bound to run into the boss battle server, good if you want to play as TF2 classes against a player who picks a boss to fight against everyone else. There are other classes to play as too, but you can find those out yourself.Other servers range from speedkarting where you're bound to die plenty of times before you see the finish line, building forts with weapons, FNAF fandom crap, and city servers that get fun when the cops are asleep, all of these types of servers never last too long.So, that's really all I've learned from playing this game.

												Pretty much a waste of money to me ...As Pigeon has mentioned, the game can only be fun when you play with your friends or on your own because as he stated the community is bad. I'd like to add that the gameplay seems very boring too. There are no good servers and yet you still have to wait about 10mins. to join one.

												Pretty much a waste of money to me ...As Pigeon has mentioned, the game can only be fun when you play with your friends or on your own because as he stated the community is bad. I'd like to add that the gameplay seems very boring too. There are no good servers and yet you still have to wait about 10mins. to join one.

												Ok so before the review i wanna tell you somethingi got the game maybe 6-5 years ago even maybe more. it was a free version i didnt know much english but i loved the game then i lost it. i have been searching for it for years but then i found it when it got released to steam sadly i had no money so i bought it after long time and its not what i expected to see. ITS MUCH better this game is awesome i wanted this game so long you can build i now build my own city! it takes long but it good game to relax so you should buy this game if you love building you can also race and do cool minigames! this game is amazing!too long to read? this game just amazing for people who love fun and building. so you should buy this game too! its not costs alot thanks for reading!

												Game rating overall- 7/10The good things about Blockland:- The gameplay style- Based off LEGO- Add-ons(Workshop shoul be created)- LEGOfied Garrys mod- Online featureThe bad things about Blockland- Issues that the creator is too lazy to fix- The games community(Seriously, they ban players from the forums for ideas on improving the game.)- Badmins- Lazy Admins/Staff- Newcomers(Possibly impaitient and annoying 8 year olds)The game itself is great, but the community is a problem. The creator, Eric Hartman(A.K.A Badspot)May have made a wonderful game, but he's too lazy to fix any problems. He bans players off the forums for having such great ideas on improving the game. Overall, the online feature is WORSE. Theres tons of admin abusers, banning newcomers, banning anyone who they think is good enough to stay. Who cares if they are trustworthy? Anyhow, the servers like Tezuni's Prison escape, Boss battles Is possibly the bestest servers out there. With steam, you cant make dedicated servers, but you can play the game like if you had the paid from website edition, where you can make dedicated servers. I give this game 7/10, Great and fantastic sandbox game, but creator needs to pay attention to his game's bugs and his game a little more. -Engicop "

												The community is what you make it, development has been in a slump recently but this game is complete and has provided a lot of replayability and room for creativity for me and a lot of the friends I made on this game (note I have few hours on steam version but likely a few hundred before I got it on Steam). Many of the negative reviews are people complaining about the developer not consistently putting out free updates consistently even for years after release, despite a strong modding community, and these people also tend to be problem users that stir up drama with developers are other players on the forum. This game IS definitely worth it, and I dare someone to tell me why its not. There is some cruddy servers but there is also the occasionally great server, just like most sandbox multiplayer games. If you're remotely interested in a lego based sandbox building game, get this game.			"

												This is a really good sandbox game! It's flexible (not as flexible as ROBLOX, though), and it's quite easy to set up certain game-modes. There's a large add-on archive which has lots of things that'll appeal to you. You can create your own add-on with some scripting knowledge (lua, I believe), and a graphics software such as Blender. It can range from new zombie types to guns, to vehicles, to items like Night Vision goggles!There's only one real issue that I may have noticed. The developer can be quite rude at times (sources are from the reviews + screenshots), and that the game really isn't updated often anymore. You don't really need updates to enjoy the game, though! Add-ons serve a large purpose.			"

												Five years of Blockland (3 years of activity):I've been playing Blockland since some of earlier days, starting in v10.  Over the whole course of that time, I've been a fairly active user.  From the time I joined in 2008 until April 2009, I was learning the ropes, how to behave, proper etiquette, etc.  In April, Blockland was un-installed when I was grounded, and I slipped away from it.  In early 2012, after several half-hearted attempts to get it back, I got it working again.  I've made a fool of myself on many occasions, but I've contributed in many ways too, mostly to in-game servers.  Blockland is definitely one of the best games I have ever played/owned in my life.Note to new Steam users: I've noticed that a lot of people have probably discriminated against you for being new.  Please don't be discouraged by this.  The majority of our community is not like that, and is more than willing to help you with anything you might need.  One of the best ways to cut the discrimination is to change your name.  You start with a default name where (*) are the ID numbers (Blockhead*****).  At the bottom of the title screen, hit the button saying 'Name' and enter any name of your choosing (assuming that it is available).- XR_7 (50690) "

												I've spent hours upon hours building everything from boats to castles to spaceships, and playing games with other people online, most likely making Blockland my second-most-played game of all time. This was a long, long time before the game appeared on Steam, however, so you'll just have to take my word for it. I have yet to find another sandbox building game that gives you the level of freedom that Blockland does, with an endless supply of user-created add-ons in the form of blocks, game-modes, and more. LEGO sets were one of my favorite toys as a child, so being able to not only have endless bricks to build with but also the ability to explore my creations up-close as a small minifigure and interact with them was a dream come true.While some people will use their imagination to bring physical form to whatever they can think up, my forte was always recreating things from other media. Not the most creative thing in the world, but it was the most enjoyable for me. At various points I worked on reconstructing playable versions of Team Fortress 2's ctf_2fort, Pokemon's Kanto region, and the entirety of Portal, as well as a large-scale model of Halo's Rocket Launcher. My only regret is that I'm not very good at finishing what I've started, as the Rocket Launcher was the only thing that ever reached total completion.Most people tend to complain about the userbase, but it's only as bad as any other place composed mostly of people in grade-school who haven't been a part of an online community before. Certain problematic users will insist this game is bad, but only because they've been punished for misbehaving time after time after time. Overall, it just takes time to adjust.			"

												Pros- Decent and fun servers- Thousands of different qualities- Many players to enjoy the fun- Decent servers up casually- Simple achievements- Simple Keybinds- Low price for great Game- Thousands of building methods- Thousands of ""Add-ons""- Community is usually activeCons- Children ages 7-12- Not the best community- Administrators can be quite abusive- Website/Dedicate Server to keep up 24/7- Doesn't Update anymore- Average graphics for the type of game- Not many choices for your Character- Add-ons for servers need to be downloaded and installed			"

												I first discovered Blockland in 2009, and I fell in love with it. Combining my hours on and off of Steam I have accumulated some 2.4 thousand hours of gameplay. The building system is complex as hell, and if you're not good with Legos then this really isn't for you. The game's fanbase has largely died out due to the death of RTB and maps (just go on the Blockland forums and look at old gallery topics or soemthing). Most of the servers that other people have started are cancer.I think my point is that if you can have fun on your own, making your own games, building your own maps, hosting your own original servers, this is the game for you. If you've come because you want to ♥♥♥♥ around in prebaked maps and have laughs, search elsewhere.			"

												this is a very interesting game, but in a good way.To start off, Blockland has a very uniqe building process, you use num pad keys to move blocks, traditional WASD keys for movement and a simple menu of blocksin a nut shell its a lego game but its better(my opinion).i think its defenatly a great game to play, but the only problem is that the mods are hard to get(then again ive never installed a mod before so im new)other than that its a great game!

One map has you destroying as much of a city in a certain amount of time while growing to Godzilla sizes.The possibilitys with this game are almost endless.			"

												Blockland may look like a Minecraft or Roblox clone at first glance to some people,but it really isn't and it in itself is much more than that. So BL is a building game first made in 2004 in the V0002 state, the retail version was then released in 2007 with the latest version being V21. Have you've ever played with LEGO's as a kid or built something with them? Did you ever have fun with them? If yes, then Blockland is the game for you. The game allows you to build with a virtually unlimted amount of bricks (There's a 256,000 brick limt,but you can set your own limt on your own server). It also even features an in-game eventing system that allows you to do cool stuff with your bricks like make a door that open and closes or a light switch. The modding community is also pretty good with a good number of brick packs, vehicles, colorsets, music, and etc. The community itself isn't the best, but there really isn't a perfect community out there anyway. You may meet some bad players here and there,but if you stay away from the bad side of the community you'll be fine. The graphics are very blocky and legolike giving a very nice look especially for a old 2003 engine.There are shaders in the game,but they look very jaggy and bad and they're also very poorly optimized at it too.If you want to there are modifications that can help you make the shadows look smoother,but you'll need a great PC to get it done. I would really recomend this game to anybody if you like building games and don't worry you'll really get your money's worth, I've spent at least about 400hrs (With my old blid and steam blid combined) on the game and haven't stopped yet.Note: When you first get the game I would highly recommend getting RTB.

												I have played Blockland for years now, experiencing many good and bad times. To be very honest, I had loved Blockland so much before steam and the version 21 (if you know what version I am talking about, the one that has removed maps). It might not be because of steam nor version 21, but this game was my teenagehood and I still play it. This game would be my all time, top 5 favorite games of all time because this game is not a competetive game if you do not want it to be. You choose whatever you want to do, whenever you want, experiencing it with friends online or just play on your own time to yourself. You can add many interesting toold, features, decals, and more to spice up your games' features. You can add these weapons and tools made by your fellow community from the forums or ingame with the rtb client. Anyways, this game would strongly be recommended by me as this game makes me feel like I am not only building with legos, but creating the creations I have dreamt of since I was young.			"

												EDIT 2: ♥♥♥♥ my reviews just look at my hoursOriginal:It may just look like a game where you just place bricks. Its alot more than that.This game opens alot of opportunites. You go on, click the join game button and see a list of at least 20 servers. Theres always plently of servers open. Prision Escape, Fort Wars, FreeBuild, CTF, Diesease, Murder Mystrey, Bot Wars, Role-play severs, Speedkart and Deathrace are all good examples. Some are modded, some arent. Another good part of the game is the mods are automatically downloaded.Edited in for popular demand: Minigames and eventing are amazing. Start up a mini game and make it the way you want. Turn the mini game to a capture the flag ot even a City RPG.Eventing is even better. Event a brick so when you click on it, it plays a song or even tells you something. Make hidden rooms with disappering bricks, Make your bots look like you, Make traps so people fly into the air and so much more that i cant remember.Sadly, on mac, It is a bit glitchy. You cant see any faces, when you start up the game it asks you to setup your settings and your player always resets.Singleplayer is mostly good for nothing, unless you have some fun mods or you just want to mess around with bots or something.It is still the funnest game ive ever played in history of games ive played. EDIT: e.g. ive played 200 hours of it. (and none of my other games have come close to that.)Mods are hard to get, there are some websites that have archives of the epic website, RTB. (that is closed) In all its such a fun game, but there are a few sad reasons of not to get it. I'd reccomend it to people that like: sandbox, building, fps, loling, role-playing, zombies and tf2 like games!!			"

It was 5 against one.He'll never win, I thought.He'll never escape, I thought.He'll never survive, I thought.I thought wrong.He managed to start a full-scale riot, him and his army of offenders. They broke all 7 of my steel doors with their bare fists, escaping into the yard. They were almost out. I quickly hired God-knows-how-many dog handlers, in a valiant effort to hold them back until the authorities get here. I managed to keep the tsunami of prisoners back, put the prison on lockdown and finally the armed police got here.I did it, I stopped the riot.But then I saw that one particular cell was empty.

												yeah its funEDIT:I've played this game for a while, and I've decided to revisit it after not playing it for a while, and it made me realize how awesome it is. The first thing I'd like to express is that this is not Minecraft, and it is not Roblox. It is different from those. This is a completely different game. You can build actual lego builds using this, and it has a friendly ""eventing system"", which is essentially programming, which lets you bring interactivity to your buildings.  I think this is a good game, it has a generally nice community, and it has a range of servers for you to choose from. There are also quite a few mods in the game, and new mods are developed pretty often. I definately reccomend it if you enjoy sandbox or building type games.			"

												The game is great and all but the community sucks, server loading sucks and takes 20 years to find a good server with a good community. The building is great with weird controls at first but once you get used to them its super easy to build.Also if you have a mac/apple (like me) you wont have access to faces and emblems but lucky blocklandturtorials on youtube to show you how to get the faces and emblems.

												I have had Blockland for the pat 5 years since v12. People will tell you the problem with this is the building system and truthfully you just need to get use to numb pad. Its the 3rd part in learning how to plant bricks in the tutorial where you put it in the small hole (that's what she said hehe) but really mastering numb pad is key to building and in-fact, makes it easier than most games since if you miss you can just press a button to move it in place. I am a builder and I am proud. I highly suggest you buy this game since its the game that keeps on giving. I have played for 5 years and I shall go another 5. P.S. if you feel like a reason not to get this game is the community remember the steam community will become the majority so all problems found in it will practically cease to exist. P.S.S. I request you call the community blockheads since blocklanders sounds dumb IMO.			"

												This game is disliked for one reason: because it is compared to Minecraft and Roblox, two very popular building games. Now, comparing this game to Minecraft is like comparing cows to pigs. It really doesn't make sense except for them being in the same category of game genres. I can see how you would compare this game to Roblox, but even then there are a LOT of differences. Roblox might be better in a way that you can have groups, dress easily, and what you can do on Roblox is limitless. But, Blockland is also limitless. One of the good parts about Blockland, is that it was entirely built by the community and everybody who has it has loved it. Yeah, it will continue having updates, but those updates won't change how fun Blockland is and it's style of gameplay. Hell, who cares if Blockland doesn't have groups, you can make your own that is based on Roleplaying, military, and so on. The skin designer is really easy to use and you can make some awesome decals for your shirt, pants, head, and everywhere. I recommend Blockland to anyone at the price it is at, because in my opinion, it is one hell of a game.			"

												Blockland is one of those games where it is what you make of it. There is no floor, and no ceiling for how good this game is, and how good it can be. I've had this game for about ten years now, and have played it for at least a month each year, and plenty more inbetween, although it has grown old for me now, it will always be my first and most favorite sandbox game of all time, with an add-on system rivaled only by Garry's mod you can't really go wrong with it.Despite having a rather toxic community that ressemble that of LoL and Dota, it actually has a very friendly add-on sharing community, where people often take requests and listen to feedback. The servers range from absolute ♥♥♥♥ to games within games, showing how diverse, yet repetitive a game can be, and having such a robust building system it opens a gateway to many, if not infinite, ways of producing content for yourself and the community.

												Woah... I gotta say, this is actually quite a fun sandbox game. This game may look cheesy, but hey it's actually not that bad... At first I thought ""Meh, I might give the game a meh rating"" but after I played it..... it was actually quite fun.Having to be able to build anything whatever you freaking want with blocks that look like legos..... Sure! Why not?Although, there are 2 downsides to the game. One, is that some of the controls feel a bit akward. (The good side though is that you do get used to it after awhile. Still, it feels werid to me atleast.) Second, the graphics don't look... all that great (even if you have the shaders on MAX.)Overall, this is a really fun sandbox game and I highly recommend it. Even though some of the controls are a bit akward and the graphics aren't that good. It's still a good game. And if you have any friends on here, it's a great mutliplayer experince. Their is also other gamemodes as well. Such as SpeedKarts, Deathmatch, and so on. So if you don't wanna be sandboxing all day you could just play those as well. Good game, fun experince. I hope you all and to my friends will enjoy it! ^-^8/10			"

												This pains me to even type up such a review, becuase I've played Blockland way back in 2008, along with Roblox, which used to be my crack. While Roblox is now a slot machine, it still maintains to update itself in such a fashion. Its now more sleek and modern that Blockland here, and that normally wouldn't be a problem, but the problem is that this the year of 2014.I'm not saying that you can't release games like Shovel Knight, but from playing Blockland in 2008, to actually buying it on Steam in 2014, not a single damn thing has hardly been changed/updated. The only major updates have actually removed cult hit maps due to ""incompatibilities"". Guys, thats the equlivent of Garry completly removing construct from GMod... but again, it still wouldn't matter. Why? The whole reason why Blockland has failed: Community. You see, if Garry decided to remove famous content, the COMMUNITY would be like ""Time to fire up some Source SDK"" in  Blockland? Nope.To site an excellent review from DarkByte97;""The community for this game is virtually nonexistant (unless you're dying to be in a commuinty full of autocratic ♥♥♥♥♥). I have not seen a gaming community full of more hostile and irrational people in my life. This is why all of our servers have nothing good.""Amen brother. Server after server, you'll meet some very arrogent people within the ""community"". Want to find some advice on subject matters that genuinely need answering? ""Lol Roblox feg go frack urself lawl go suck Builderman's stud loL!!11!"" The community sites Roblox as a terrible game, yet does nothing for their beloved game to actually help stand out against a superior platform for block building. What about Gameplay? Surely thats half-way decent... Building is... absolutley awful. Where you have a entire keyboard and mouse to use to construct your ""uber amazing"" projects, you use a numpad... its a awkard and seemingly unnecessary game mechanic to learn. Why can't I just simply right click to place a block? No, you HAVE to use the numpad, and if you don't, then you're too stupid. Again, age has been an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ to this game, so clunky controls come with it.EDIT 1: You can rebind keys if you find the numpad off settingWhat about mods? Yeah, it supports them, and there are some good ones out there... on a site that shut down a couple of months ago. Yup. Awesome right? There are archives out there however, but still isn't as great as RTB.But hands down, the WORST part about Blockland is not the game itself, as old as it may be, but what surrounds it. The developer's complete ignorance and the communities lazy boy style of support, there's no water in Blocklands well, and its a damn shame becuase it has such amazing potential. I got lucky, I only bought this for a buck or two during the summer sale, but it was hardly worth that. If ""Badspot"" even decides to update Blockland with Steam Workshop, (he said he would, but that was a long time ago) maybe we'll see some cool stuff, and that the Steam community will do what the ocean did to Atlantis, and layer over the arrogent Blocktards, and shove some fire into Blockland's cold, dead heart.

												Wow. I never actually thought that I'd see a building game that got my attention. The grahpics are amazing, the animations are appealing. But, I have to be honest, the community is just..terrible. Depending on who it is, or where he/she is from, it doesn't make a make a big change or impact on the community. But, appart from that, on single-player its actually pretty peaceful. You can make ideas for your server that you're ""going"" to make, or just have fun freebuilding. Basically, this game is similar to minecraft but with a different building style. I thought you might want to read this before you actually get into the game, so you have a little notion of what you're doing. The building style uses the Numpad keys, 123456789 and 0, the Numpad keys move the brick to where you want it to go, without clicking somewhere and it goes. Overall-review: 9/10. I like the game, but the community just bad. But, I have not listed all the details about Blockland, you can read about it in different reviews. The one ""A.W.E.S.O.M -4000"" posted is a little more helpful. Thank you for your time.			"

												I've played Blockland ever since V15, and I'd loved it every single minute. Sure I had some times where things didn't go well for me playing this game, but I was always able to pull through my problems in the game. I loved every single bit of detail coming from maps (back in V20 and below), shaders and shadows, and every single mod that was created from global Blockland players from around the world. I've made great friends, and introduced friends to this game, they loved it very much as well. Also thanks to this game, I went from not only just a player of this game, I went to a person who's really addicted to this game, and can't stop playing. I also finally learned how to make mods in certain categories too! Everyone loves the mods that i've made too.Badspot, you've done a very well done on making and progressing this game to satisfaction!

												If you enjoy playing with lego's, this is certainly a game for youBlockland is an non-linear lego-esque sandbox game with no goals or objectives. Instead, you start in an empty world with only your imagination. Players use bricks to construct anything they desire. Houses, castles, spaceships, anything you can think of. The only real limit is the brickcount, which i believe is around 1,000,000 bricks at once. Unless you're some hardcore extreme builder, you'll never hit this limit and you'll be free to build anything you want without worrying about running out of bricks(a common problem found with real life legos).If you don't like building alone, it's very easy to set up a server and have friends join the fun. You could even enter a public freebuild server and hangout there.Building not you're style? That's alright, this game has multiple gamemodes aka multiple ways of playing the game. Challenge some friends to a kart race, or join a deathmatch server and show off your mad MLG no-scoping skills. Team up with other players to defeat a powerful boss. Escape from prison while avoiding police brutality. Enter a city rp, empires rp, slave rp,or, everyone's favorite roleplay, the family rp. If none of that sounds interesting, you could always try to make your own gamemode and contribute to the community.Speaking of communtity content, the blockland forums is filled with countless amounts of add ons and new content to spice up your game. Download some new weapons, get a new car, fly a stunt plane. If you're a builder, there's tons of custom bricks and tools to make building easier and more fun.A lot of reviews here seem to warn you about the game's community to some extent. I'll be honest, there are some pretty bad people in the game, particlularly on the forums. However there are lots of cool people aswell to meet in game and on the forums, and that's not so bad.THE VERDICT:I spent $20 on this game before it's steam release, and probably have 500 hours on that version. Now it's only $10, so it's even more worth it. And when it goes on sale, you should have no reason not to buy this wonderful game.So, why are you reading this review and not buying/playing this game? Get it now, you won't regret it.			"

												tl;dr don't touch this game with a 10 foot pole.To start- Personal Problems- Gameplay Problems- The ForumsBefore you readI cannot recommend this game. Before I start this off, I'd like to address the 1,000 hours thing. Most of my hours are from either from me leaving the game open for my friends (partially due to the fact that blockland on steam has no dedicated support, and lacking a client made me deal with doing this for a bit), dealing with my friends playing this game, or actually enjoying 1-2 gamemodes that are put out on the game that are pretty much non existent now. I have a love hate relationship with this game, you can make something done so well, working through the games pretty dated limitations, to be utterly destroyed by the community in any way possible, because if one problem is apparent, then everyone will try to exploit and break the system you've created. I mean sure that can go for everything, right? Well not like how the community treats it. You're the bad guy if the system is partially flawed, not the people actively trying to break your system. I have been on the fence of making this review for a good 6 months or so, mostly due to how I feel about the game and the community as said from above.Personal Problems inbound, Community TooOh, I know you! You're that jerk on the forum who hosted that one server!I don't think I want to host it ever again with how the community lashed out at me, it doesn't matter if I'm the victim at this point, here's my reasoning for why I say this: If you look at the previous works with my friends, I'm not involved, I'm not claiming to make everything, I'm trying to stay away from the spotlight because I outright don't deserve it. That's why I'm not the poster for these things, I'm not handling hosting an the event, and I'm not in charge of most of what's happening. I'm not in charge of any of this ♥♥♥♥ other than posting updates (which I didn't even do entirely), the formatting for threads, and music for our events. I don't want to pin the blame on others, because they don't deserve it, but this was outrageous. Now, during the event one of our events broke, spamming music. You know what we had to do? Restart the server. Oh, it's a tragedy, right? How dare we restart the server because something I HAD NO CONTROL OVER, broke. You know what happens then? a good 50+ people start collectively ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on me when again, I HAD NO CONTROL OVER IT. I had blame pinned on me for no reason, and the community is downright ignorant.Oh, but you act like a prick!!I don't want to take part in the community for the most part anymore, if I ever go on the game again it's because of my friends motives, and anything I do towards the community I do if I really feel like it's needed. I'm not saying my actions back in the past are justified because I hate the image I made for myself, but if nobody is willing to give me even a chance to act like a competent person then why even try? If I come back under a different name, people will find who I am and continue ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on me for something I did. It's not even worth my time, either. I don't want to deal with a community that actively attacks people in and outside of the community if they have a disability, I don't want associate with a community that acts this awful towards people, it's petty. I understand  I haven't been the best person around in the community, but even if I decided to change, nobody would give a ♥♥♥♥. It's easier to act like a ♥♥♥♥ back unprovoked and act ignorant because that would get someone banned faster.If you hate the community, why have you been apart of it for so long?I have just outright tolerated it, but it has been the forum that has kept a lot of people towards the game for awhile, and getting off of it has been a hard time, but finally saying I don't want anything to do with that place anymore feels welcoming due to how awful the community can be sometimes. Toleration doesn't mean that I like it, though. I have just put up with the community, nothing more, nothing less until recently.Gameplay ProblemsWhat do you mean 1-2 gamemodes you've enjoyed? Wouldn't you recommend the game for that?I have 1,000 hours on this game, I've played a majority the game has to offer, and I'm not going to be the generic ""the game isn't fun anymore"" type of person. You have to actively sift through the ♥♥♥♥ on the master list to find games that are actually enjoyable, and a good 90% of the time there's nothing to offer. By the chance there is something fun to play, the community again attacks whatever me or my friends do because we're a group of like 6-7 people at a time. You know, because that many people is threatening and if we have power that one person has to constantly annoy us because they want to ""join us"" and mess everything up, and when they don't get their way they throw a ♥♥♥♥♥ fit and attack us whenever they can. This has happened so many times it's just outright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I'm sick and tired of this happening constantly.What do you mean limited?The game came out like 10 years ago, the game is limited and has not had a big update in what, three years?! (3/13/17) What's there to play for? Nothing will be new and the community isn't treating the game that well either.One mistake? How so?The game is overall broken, there is so much broken to the point of where you can get out of maps that you have built. For example, you build something in a cube format, you can glitch and jump out through the walls and has never been fixed. You have to use zonebricks as a solution to this, and the downside to that? No water bricks. The game is also very very broken. If you sat down to play speedkart for an hour, I assure you that you have been shot away by the awful physics at least 5 times at a minimum. You have to work in the games awful limitations, and fix the games awful problems to manage to host one thing decent, mess up something or don't lock it down fully? Don't expect your server up for more than an hour.Oh, but you still enjoyed it!That doesn't mean I'll ever want others to play this game. Just because I have the patience to sit through and sift through god awful gamemodes is beyond the normal persons attention span.Deny it all you want, the community is declining. (Community plays a heavy role)Sorry to break it to everyone, but Blockland isn't what it used to be. I joined pretty late compared to others, but heck even in my time there were fun servers up with stuff to do. Now there's what, one or two (two if you're lucky) servers with over 20 people? It's hilarious. If you're playing it today and you're keeping your projects private/not releasing them, you're doing just as much as the people complaining about the game dying. Sorry to be blunt but that's the harsh truth.The ForumsThis is just going to be a small touch to this but, never join the forums. The forums are one of the worst places on the internet, never get involved with the people there.It's not a joke how bad the forums are.People are serious with how bad they are. Don't join to find out, just don't even go to the website. Stay as far away from it as possible. It is the epitome of a ♥♥♥♥ community.To conclude, I think the community does not play good service for the game, and I can tell you first hand that a good majority of the people in game are less than pleasant. Now that doesn't mean everyone is bad, there are some people that are actually worth talking to, but it's a minority.Edit 3/13/17: I split my problems between myself and the game itself, follow what you wish.

												I've had this game for many years even before it was on Steam, and I am overjoyed that it is now here. This game is worth it, and will be a long time before you get bored as long as you are imaginative and have friends to play with. Infact, I met most of my steam friends because of this game. The game has an ""environment"" system in which the textures for the skybox (skybox textures also will load their own lighting settings) and ground can be changed, a day and night cycle can be applied, water or lava can be added with customizability to the water level, as well as changes to the view distance and fog distance are possible. There are also a lot of Add-Ons for this game, which have impressive stability (Add-Ons are Found on These Forums: https://forum.blockland.us/index.php.) You can literally have 150 or more different Add-Ons made by different people, even some for older versions of Blockland, and they will continue to work with basically no problems at all. Try saying that for GMod where I can manage to have the game crash with less than 50 add-ons together.This game is certainly worth it however my only gripe with it is the lack of Linux support but even that is barely needed since it quite literally runs flawlessly on Linux using Wine versions 1.7 and up without a hickup ever.

												This is marked as a negative for only a few reasons of that of which I'm going to explain. First off, I saw this game around its older and more golden years. I saw the mods, the weapons, the missions, the GUI features and the many things that the community were throwing in and everyone was loving it! I wanted Blockland. Badly. Unfortunately, I could not get it until its Steam release. But only now as I buy this, I find out that RTB is closing down and maps have been removed. This was a huge disappointment to me and those who wanted to play alone at their free will and explore and do missions that people would create. Now, don't get me wrong. This game is awesome and a ton of fun. But its strongest hole is the bad timing of things I wanted to try like everyone else around its golden age. Steam, I can only pray and hope that you will return a better community that are worthy to make the perfect addons. Again, this is much like the same issue Garry's mod had. When I saw Gmod, it looked amazing and fantastic. I played Gmod 12 and loved it all. That was when at the very cut second Gmod 13 was released and I lost that feature. Blockland....Please don't fail like Gmod did. Just do what everyone else wants. Addons and maps again. That is all I want. Other then that, this game is worth getting if you love to have a lot of freedom. But if you are one who has seen Blockland in its older ages before the steam release, you are likely better off waiting but if you want, its likely worth it to buy this anyways for the simple fact of its fun little multiplayer servers.
