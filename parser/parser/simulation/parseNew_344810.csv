												Let me start with a tl:dr version:This is a management type sim. Not a game where you get to control a wrestler in an actual match.This isn't the company's current offering in the series, but the software sold from their website is evil - meaning it's tied to ELicense. So even if you aren't a fan of Steam - be thankful you haven't messed with ELicense.That aside - this version has well established mods and is plenty of fun if simulations and wrestling are interests of yours.----My original review on why I'd recommend it.Total Extreme Wrestling (TEW) is a fun game if you always wanted to delve into the management side of wrestling.Management side of wrestling? Yes, the side of the industry where we all know it's story based entertainment, with athletes portraying the roles of actors, all with varying degrees of success. In this game you play the role of the person who runs the company, building the stable of your wrestlers through contracts, defining which talent you'll be aligning to which story line, and who they'll be facing in order to make it all entertaining for the people who come to watch the show. This is where the challenge comes in, as the best long running plot can fail utterly if you use the wrong kind of talent in pulling it off. For example, you may create a grudge war which pits two of your wrestlers against each other for the fans viewing pleasure. The individual steps of that grudge war can include actions such as one wrestler taunting the other in a pre-match interview. Well, if the wrestler you have give the interview isn't skilled in speaking well, then the fans might not find the taunting interesting enough, and as a result, they'll be cold towards the next event as they begin to loose interest.The end result you find is it's a management / business sim where you need to hire athletic actors to manipulate the masses by entertaining them and playing with their emotions, which then nets you the money you need to keep the business going.Also, while some folks enjoy the wrestling universe that comes with the game, I myself find it hard to relate to, so I usually find one of the fine ""Real-world"" mods that the TEW community has created, so that way I can hire / fire / ruin the career of wrestlers I actually am familiar with.While this isn't the current version of the game (TEW 2013 is), the current version is only sold on the company website. I've owned both, and found that I put more hours into TEW 2010.			"

												*Note: I played the eLicence version of this game for many hours; the Steam time was just to remind me of the following points*TEW 2010 is an excellent framework for fantasy booking. It is highly moddable (with a dedicated fanbase which take full advantage of that) and allows a lot of room for imagination. As a game, it's deeply flawed.The interface is poor, with far too much clicking required to see key information. So much time is wasted finding angles even with the default database, let alone mods which tend to flood the game with them. Want to use the same location for every show? There's no default; you'll have to select it every single time.Booking is a downright chore. You'll tend to use the same booking notes for most matches, and having to add them match after match, show after show, becomes painfully repetitive. The interface's limitation is exposed all too clearly in this mode - you can't even click and drag to re-order matches, you have to use arrow buttons.Feedback is limited - you can enable a feature which at least gives some points which affected the rating, but some segments still inexplicably bomb.Perhaps the biggest structural flaw is the Overness system, which underpins everything in the game. For such a crucial feature, it is woefully simplistic. When a winner has even a little less overness than the loser, that winner will often cannibalise some of their overness. This has three obvious problems:1) It ignores everything else. Did the loser get attacked a dozen times by the winner's allies during the match? Did the winner cheat? Was the ref biased? Was it a little show attended by a few hundred people rather than a televised show in the region? It's all ignored.2) It's easily exploited. Sign a popular wrestler on a short-term deal or, more ridiculously, bring in another promotion's top wrestlers on a talent trade, and just feed them to your up-and-comers for the sort of boost which would take you months of careful booking.3) It makes playing as a company like TNA (particularly 2006-2012) ridiculous. The likes of Sting and Kurt Angle must have significantly more overness than AJ Styles or Samoa Joe, since it represents their name value. Dare to book them to lose to people like Styles and Joe, and they will argue against it (or outright refuse if they have creative control), and will have their overness cannibalised every match. It's a nonsensical system, and it underpins the game.The other flaw is that worker generation and development is broken. The game world simply breaks down over time, as new workers do not develop performance skills - and thus cannot put on good-quality matches. It is a well-known problem - see the large thread on the official forums http://www.greydogsoftware.com/forum/showthread.php?t=199350It was never fixed in this game. While the 2013 version finally fixes this, it is not available on Steam and has its own issues - while 2010 has some relatively readily accessible information, such as an exportable roster, a roster overview screen which lets you sort wrestlers by skill and a neat summary of their abilities at the bottom of the profile, 2013 removes all of this for a fog of war system. Even with fog of war turned off, these helpful features are gone.If you have a lot of imagination and want to write a diary of your experiences, this is a great option for you. There's a lot of potential in the game as an infrastructure for fantasy booking - you can go back into the world of the Monday Night Wars, or the territory days, or even relatively modern times (though modern mods have dried up, given the age of the game).If you want to play this as a strategic sports management game, though, you may be disappointed. It is too unintuitive, too easily exploited, too clunky to stand alongside others in the genre. Its real advantage here is its lack of competition - if you want a wrestling booking sim, this is pretty much your only option. Still, unless you're dead-set on a wrestling game, the same dev's World of Mixed Martial Arts series is a better option for people more interested in sports management than fantasy booking.			"

												EDIT: We need to nominate this game for a Steam Award! Preferably the ""5 more minutes"" Award! If this game is even nominated, it could open the doors to TEW 2016 coming to Steam, and I would sell a limb for that to happen!Honestly couldn't recommend this game enough. It may look a little rough around the edges, it might not have the best design or graphics but at it's core is a great wrestling sim that is very different, and very time consuming. In this game, you are not a wrestler, but instead you are the booker of either a ficticious wrestling company or your own. I may also add that this game is very mod friendly, you can easily import logos for your own company, or find mods that allow you to play as WWE, TNA, ROH, Shimmer, NJPW and many others from all around the globe.If you choose to start your own company (which I recommend the most), you can assemble an all-star roster, compete with the big guys and get TV and PPV deals. If you find slight interest in backstage wrestling politics, you'll love this game. You can have fights in the locker room, maybe you gave someone creative control and they excercise the option frequently. It's not bare bones, it is in depth and I'm still finding new elements to the game! My biggest star got into an accident while holding the title. I conducted drug tests and found a lot of my locker room had taken substances, so it was my job to decide how I was going to punish them. It's a game about choice, and you can shape your own company.When you get onto the front page of the fictional wrestling news site when your title has changed hands, you know you've made it big. As your popularity rises and you become more of a staple in the wrestling industry, you are covered more by the media and are targeted by the bigger promotions, for example they can start chants in your arena, bring signs promoting other wrestling shows. Think like the Monday Night Wars. You can decide how women's wrestling is conducted in your company. Women may not be on your shows as competitors, they can have a small division or be fully intergrated into the roster, with them competing for the same titles as men. You can establish your own arenas, more like the Impact Zone and the Lucha Underground set. More importantly you can set up wrestling dojos and developmental branches (Note: Dojos and Developmental Companies aren't the same).The game is pretty much one of my favorite PC games right now. It takes up a lot of my time, and I feel like I've just scratched the surface. It has no sound, and it's only in windowed mode. For me these aren't drawbacks but I thought it was worth mentioning. I find it helpful, if you have a duel monitor set-up, you can play the game and also have something like WWE Network play in the background (I recommend the Monday Night Wars show, as it illustrates the backstage antics and gives you a good idea of what talent to sign).The game has it's own universe with characters and promotions already installed. Mods are easy to find on the TEW Warehouse website, they have Attitude Era mods, and current day mods. I've even seen some fantasy mods with characters from TV Shows, Movies and other Video Games.This is a 10/10 game, even though it doesn't look like it at face value. I honestly belive that the asking price is still a steal, you're getting so much for what really is so little.I hope the developers of the game see this review and know that there is a lot of interest in a sequel and we also hope that you choose to release TEW 2013 on Steam, as it would bring a new audience to the game, as this entry on Steam has brought me towards the series after hearing so much about it. TEW 2016 anyone?			"

												For somebody considering the latest version of the game and has not played a TEW title before, I'd recommend this version. In one of the more crucial areas - storylines - it is more user friendly, with evolving storylines and plot points. It will give you a good grasp of the series' game mechanics and introduce you to the main characters of the CornellVerse if you use the default database. Contrast this with the newest title, which has a steeper learning curve, and storylines and angles that are completely open to interpretation and user implementation. This freedom is just one of the reasons why I prefer the later versions, but without being introduced to the game in an earlier version I'd have found things much harder and frustrating to get to grips with.

												This is essentially a much deeper version of the old-school wrestling management sims. You play the role of the 'booker' that needs to construct the flow of the pro wrestling show. This is the core of the game: decide who opens your show, what the storylines are and who to push. You can add notes on who should take bumps, who needs to look strong or which match needs to be scripted beforehand. You can shape your product (WWEntertainment, the modern TNA in its beginning years, traditional old-school family entertainment, hardcore, Puroresu, etc). The financial aspect is very significant as well. The game requires thought at all times. If you book a WWE-style you need to have a plan or you'll get bested by the competition. Talent development is very important, and so is keeping the locker room healthy by managing conflict situations. Besides that, there's more to do such as managing TV and PPV deals, scouting, etc.The game comes with a surprisingly wellmade fictional universe, but the community mods offer several historic real-world settings. Just the chance to rebook the Invasion angle sold me on this. If anything, get it to understand the position of WWE nowadays. If you are a Cena hater, try playing as E and see if you'd truly discard him. You'll find it's not easy to do. :)It's true that there's a newer version out there for only 5$ more, but beginners might want to start with this one as the difficulty curve is lessened. There's a demo to help you decide. Most of the 100+ hours spend on this series was with the older TEW07, which is simpler and therefore more fun to start out with.The game is a dry manager sim so not much action of a graphic nature. You don't get to see the matches, or even get notes on what happened. Feedback is given in the shape of a grade to show how good the match was. There's also no full screen mode. If you don't mind this I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun with the game. Just keep in mind it requires some work to get inducted into the game. This is no game to take lightly.			"

												Like one review I read for this, I have to say, this game is pretty in depth.  Like overwhelmingly in depth.  But its nothing a bit of personal science can't overcome eventually.To summerize, you are the booker of a wrestling promotion.  YOU make the matches, YOU make the story lines, YOU sign talents to your company.  You virtually do it all in a very hands on way.  What you do will also effect your relationship with the promotions owner, the talents backstage and how your company does overall.  There is so much in this game, that if I listed it all, this review will be TL;DR, but for an example, you can assign gimmicks to wrestlers, make them Face or Heel ( good guy - bad guy )...or if you are feeling like a toootal **** you can just outright bury the wrestler that has somehow irked you.  There is so much to do, just give anything a try.And if thats not enough, then....just make your own promotion, wrestlers, talents, gimmick ect ect ect through the games very handy and easy to use editor feature.  I have made a start on doing my own and it does take a bit of time, but its worth it when you got your own pet promotion and talents going.Do recommend, will just devour time and is very engaging.

												Great game for anyone that is a ""student"" of professional wrestling, or even the less popular term of sports entertainment. You can take over 1 of roughly 30 promotions worldwide, that cater to all the styles of wrestling, as well as promotion levels. Want to take over a WWE style promotion? What about a WCW type in the late 90s? Ring of Honor? ECW? All of the options are there, or you can tweak the style of the promotion manually. AMAZING depth when you run the game with all of or multiple regions; you can pick from US, Japan, Europe, Canada, Mexico, Australia, etc. Again, anyone who is a loves the business from a high level (just meaning not controlling the wrestlers directly, but nearly everything else), this game is for you.

												If you're a fan of Football Manager, Eastside Hockey Manager, Out of the Park Baseball, or any other text-based sim game... this is one of the best. It's very deep and there's just so many options. Total Extreme Wrestling does not have the WWE licence, but you can get mods all over the web, including from Grey Dog software's official forums. In this game, you take on the role of the head booker (or owner, I believe) in a wrestling company. You look after PPVs, TV, production, contracts, employees, etc, etc, etc. It's your show and you need to get to the #1 company in the world (or stay there if you pick the best).There is a newer version of this game, which is even better, but double the price and not available on Steam. I hope it comes to Steam soon because it improves on the already fantastic game of Total Extreme Wrestling 2010.			"

There is no actual gameplay of the fights itself : everything is showed in the form of stats and numbers (or letter grades if you really want it to be hardcore). TEW 2016 should come in April-June and I plan to buy it. I think TEW 2010 is an affordable intro to the series.			"

												Total Extreme Wrestling is not wrestling game.  Instead it is a DEEP simulator about wrestling.  If you've had no experience with simulators like Footbal Manager or OOTP Baseball, then be very cautious before purchasing.  You might be dissapointed.  The other thing to bear in mind is that the presentation is pretty bare bones.  There is no music and you don't actually see matches.  With that said, the game is actually loads of fun.  It puts you in control of your own wrestling promotion and leaves you to your own devices to develop storylines, add titles, create stables, etc.  It is incredibly unforgiving for first timers, so plan to spend several hours navigating the menus and getting a handle on how the game works.  Once you do though, it's possible to lose countless hours in this game.  I definitely recommend this game if you are really in to sims!			"

												This game is DEEP. The engine makes for a completely realistic sim. Too much spending and not enough revenue will run your company straight into the ground and the things you do behind the scenes matter just as much as the shows you put on. By the same token, the text basis of the game may not be a graphic masterpiece but if you have a little imagination you can see it all in your head and it boosts an already-great game to a whole new level. TEW is easy to mod into the real world and by putting yourself into the game but Adam Ryland has created his own universe that is possibly more intriguing anyway. I find myself thinking about what I'm going to do next even when I'm not playing the game and in that way it completely immerses you into its world. If you find the behind the scenes of the business interesting in any way, this will be worth way more than the pricetag Steam puts on it.My only problem with the game is that when I put myself into the game, the highest rating I could get on my ""sexy"" gimmick was an E-			"

												Consider this the advanced version of Extreme Warfare Revenge, or the Football Manager of pro-wrestling. It takes a little while to get used to, and new users might be put off by this, but there are a few little modding communities out there who try and keep the game up-to-date, which keeps the game quite fresh and are willing to help out new users.  Stick with it and you can get lost for hours booking your wrestling empire to the top!			"

												Good sim.Quite hard the first few times you play, but once you use your head and take 5 min to learn the subtleties of TEW 2010, it is quite enjoyable.This edition is much better than the 2013, you can actually create in detail your storyline in opposition to TEW 2013 where you cannot (at least I have not seen how you can do it).I don't see the point of bringing TEW 2013 on steam since TEW 2010 is a much better sim.A to buy considering the low low price here.

												I was excited to get this game on Steam as I had an older version of this game many years ago and was looking forward to an updated version.  Sadly, it would not install properly, hanging up in installation.  I gave up and went to bed while it was frozen on a screen, resulting in nine hours of 'play time' making it ineligible for a refund.  The support site is non existent and the forums do not address this flaw.  What was once a fascinating strategy game  has turned into a complex of malfunctioning code.  Don't waste your time or money.			"

												I'm all for games with a sharp learning curve. I have over a thousand hours in grand strategy games from paradox, and over 300 hours in an early access title called Gear City, which is very much a spreadsheet simulator the way that this game is. I can't find any way to play this game without a tutorial. I can't imagine it would be impossible for the creators to write one, so I don't really understand why it's absent. I'm willing to power through the clunky UI to the good game beneath it, but I guess I'm just not smart enough. "

												Amazing game, especially for those who have an interest in managment and wrestling games.Although it is not much in it gameplay in terms of wrestling matches, the ability to create custom stories with wrestlers you build up yourself is so satisfying.Not to mention the amazing modding community that is out there for this game, install the real world mod then you can rule which ever company you wish, WWE, ROH, NJPW and even the dreaded TNA.I highly reccomend this game to anyone who has ever had an intrest in becoming a booker.CAN YOU DIG IT SUKKKAAAAAAA			"

												Text based wrestling management game that rose from free indie roots. The downside with TEW is that the fantasy characters and companies stop you from identifying with them as much as you would if they were based more closely on real-life and it would take far too much effort to re-create rl situations using the inbuilt editor. There are parts of TEW that will seem completely bewildering to all but those who love to tinker with sandbox style software toys and this may put off more of the game's audience than it attracts. Also there is no blow-by-blow comentary with this one (unlike that which can be found in its sister MMA title). Despite these weaknesses, and plenty of room for improvement, TEW is a fine management game that allows the player to express their creativity with very few limits on what kind of show they can make. I just feel that something BETWEEN this slightly convoluted game and it's over simplified counterpart - World of Mixed Martial Arts 3 - would be better than either are currently.*edit* it should be noted that the '2010' of the title refers to the time-frame WITHIN the fantasy game world rather than anything to do with rl time. The previous title was called 2008 and the only following title is called 2013 (not sure why but it is not available on steam)			"

												Fan of GDS- WMMA series from the initial to the 4th installment.  After I finally got burnt out from playing those, I decided to try TEW.  I think its a bit more tedious then WMMA series mainly because you have to book the result/angles/appease the lockeroom/etc but I feel there is more micromanaging prowess in comparison to WMMA series.  If you are unsure whether or not you like complete/ultimate power running everything, then try the demo at GreyDog Software website.The game is has great mods as well that you can get from the GreyDog Software forums, so you can actually use use world mods/etc.  Fun game.

												Note: My hour-count for this is going to be hilariously out of wack. Simply opening the TEW database is not resource-intensive, so I tend to keep it open for days and days.TEW simulates the broad strokes of the wrestling business--it's not about each match on their own, but about events as a whole, making inroads into new territories, managing your finances, etc.Of course, when running a promotion, you can book your own feuds and matches and see the outcome, but the result doesn't describe to you that The Ultimate Dingo and Stantino Mozarella started off with a sloppy drop-down, leapfrog, clothesline spot, but got back into the crowd's good graces by way of duelling 1080 splashes, just that one guy beat the other in so-and-so minutes in an effort befitting of a B+ player.If you understand the business, it's all fairly simple, since your goal is simply to put on good events. I honestly have no earthly idea what to do in Crusader Kings (though I'm hell bent on learning it at some point!) and I haven't even finished the tutorial to Civilization yet, but TEW is a lot easier to get a handle on. For some people, getting a real-life mod will help ease them into it, as it's a lot easier to keep track of a world where you know most of the names instead of having to familiarize yourself with thousands of new names and which promotions they belong to. Personally, I really don't have the patience to run several shows per week to retain my status as the booker of the biggest promotion on the planet, and I certainly don't have the business acumen (and, again, patience) to turn my rinky-dink backyard fed into a viable rival to the WWE. But I very much appreciate that these things are possible, and I like giving major a go for a few months every now and again. What I like to do is fool around with low-to-mid-level promotions that are established enough to attract solid workers, but not yet established enough to hire just anyone or get a lucrative TV or PPV deal. It's fun to toil in relative obscurity while trying to build a cult following around performers that you wouldn't expect to see rise up a card. Most players are going to be more goal-oriented than me, and I think the game can be rewarding for those, too. I do wish the game had a bit more personality or life to it--it's a bit by-the-numbers, literally, though the option to have some variation on wrestler stats and attributes at the start of a game is a nice way of trying to create a unique experience.That being said, the main draw for me is the database editing. Trying to come up with a fully-realized wrestling universe and then seeing it play out is just a ton of fun for my inner 13-year-old, who was doing the same thing with his Turtles figures right after discovering pro wrestlin' nearly two decades ago. The level of detail in the worker creator is pretty nifty, with a ton of stats (other than their proficiency in the standard styles of wrestling, you can grade their grasp of wrestling psychology, their toughness, their star quality, how injury prone they are, their ability to play various roles, how well they understand the Japanese style of wrestling, etc.) and backstory stuff (are they heavy drinkers, do they keep to themselves, are they ruthless, driven characters, etc.) that really makes it feel like you're creating well-rounded characters. For me as a wrestling fan, it's just a fun sandbox to be creative in. I also really appreciate the 'quick add' function, that lets you choose from a variety of established stereotypes to speed up the initial creation process. I don't remember that being in the next iteration.Speaking of the next iteration, I really hope to see it on Steam eventually. Not because it's a superior game that deserves a bigger platform, though it is, but mainly because Mein Gott, is it ever a pain to deal with the e-license stuff; I don't think I'd be able to get my e-license for the sequel back at this point because apparently it's connected to the email you used at the time. The only way I could justify paying for it all over again is if it was available on Steam. It's a shame that the TEW representative (or maybe Ryland himself, since surely he was the one in charge of the decision-making) made a bad first impression here, since I think a less bonkers price could have made new players give it a chance and lapsed players get back into it. Instead, they inexplicably asked for a high price on an outdated product-- the vast majority of people who were going to buy this game already bought it years ago, and only diehard fans are going to pay a premium for it (which is honestly ridiculous, considering a newer version of this game exists, but I'm on a new computer and I wanted nothing more to do with the e-license stuff), so why try to squeeze so much money out of a dry market instead of coming in with a bit of humility, and perhaps getting some new eyes on the product? I don't know where I'm going with this sea of apostrophes. I love the TEW games (and EWR); they're easily my most-played PC game of all-time, and I think anyone who is interested in the inner workings of wrestling could find something to like here.			"

												I've always been a huge fan of Grey Dog Software's take on the wrestling world. I, also, have always been a huge fan of wrestling simulation games. Why? They allow you to take all of your craziest booking ideas and throw them into a text based game, that uses words to bring it all to life. TEW 2010 for only $5 bucks is an ABSOLUTE steal. Take advantage of this, and don't be overly picky. Just have fun with the amazing characters that they made, and the fun atmosphere.			"
