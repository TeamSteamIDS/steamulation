												Eight years after the previous cult classic LotR2 came this much anticipated title - now over ten years ago, but fans of the series probably still remember the growing disappointment and frustration they felt as they played it. It is not an outright horrible game, but it just fails at every turn and constantly provides a frustrating and annoying flow to the game.At first it doesn't seem quite so bad - although the first thing you find out is that basically the entire economy has been removed wholesale, and instead you just have underlings to manage each plot of land you own, and your choices are which ones - needing to assign enough food producing serfs to support your army, choosing which knights to assign with their different unit types, churches for morale, towns for income, etc. One good part here is that there are numerous named lords, mayors, and merchants with different bonuses they add to their region or your nation.So you assign some knights/lords and they raise an army and you wait for its morale/numbers to reach maximum, merge your units together and head off to invade the enemy, having nothing else to do in the game once all your parcels of land are assigned. You engage the enemy and find the more granular unit control of LotR2 (which plays like a true RTS) has been abandoned for a return to the system of LotR1 - you order your knights around, and their troops follow them as a unit (similar to Total War). This is okay for open field battles, but invading the walls of a castle basically becomes impossible to do successfully, so you resort to just smashing the walls down with siege weapons to turn it back into an open field battle.Up to this point there are pros and cons compared to its predecessor, however once you have defeated your enemies armies is where everything goes wrong. You move on to siege his castle to conquer the region, and while you are doing this all lhis feudal lords have respawned at their parcels and now tend to wander into your lands in small units to raze your food production - and you don't have enough units to both attack and defend very well, and even if you do intercept and kill off his raiders they just respawn again instantly at their base - even if you dishonourably kill the ones you capture, there are always more to assign even if they have worse stats/unit types. Oh, and did I mention any time you are controlling a battle personally time is going on in the main map? So those raiders will be screwing you over if you want to actually control an interesting/close/important battle.On the earlier, smaller maps this is annoying but can be overcome due to the limited amount of units and regions in play, and because just taking one more region from what you start with gives you enough of a numeric advantage to field an offensive force and a couple of quick reaction forces to repel these weak raiders positioned appropriately, so you progress slowly and conquer Ireland and southernEngland and move on to the larger scenarios, shuffling armies about on the map, not normally being able to participate in battle yourself, but slowly gaining an advantage and then usually quickly finishing off the map once you reach a certain critical mass of parcels to work with.Then you get to the more meaty maps, like France during the 100 Years War,with two opponents and loads of regions and no clear defensive lines and you give up as it turns into a giant game of whack-a-mole chasing around all the tiny raid forces constantly running over your land while your main unit tries to repel either of the main armies your opponents send around every now and then, and no matter how many of those raiding parties you kill off more keep coming.Note also on a technical level this seems to be a bit flaky - alt tab seems to cause crashes regularly, or you also can get stuck not being able to return to the game (click back on it and the screen never redisplays), so if you do get this it might be prudent to save any time you need to switch out of the game. Note also Steam only currently seems to count time spent in the pre-launcher in the time played for this game.In the end effectively the entire economic part of the game is gone, but at the same time the combat side isn't really great, plus most of the time you can't afford to spend time taking part in the actual battles because you have to constantly be dealing with tiny raid forces that can do outsized damage to your ability to field an army.

-Quick Review-Lords of the Realm III is a medieval economic and combat strategy game developed by Impressions Games and released in 2004. This was the third and final Lords of the Realm game developed by Impression Games, it was actually the last game Impression Games developed, trumpeting most people's opinion on this game.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: As is the theme for the Lords of the Realms Games, Lords of the Realm III takes place during the European Dark Ages. I'd love to say something very educational about the dark ages, but I'm not feeling very bright. *slaps knee*The only sense of ""story"" in Lords of the Realm III is in the text from the campaigns and battles where you're given a brief explanation, and sometimes a background of the battle or struggle you're about to participate in.For example, the text for the 1066, Hastings Battle gives a quick paragraph explaining how Harold of Wessex ended up fighting William of Normandy (William the conqueror).

			All of the screenshots are broken in Lords of the Realm III because the steam overlay doesn't work.		


Gameplay: In Singleplayer you have two types of game modes: Campaigns, and Battles. The campaigns are taken a step forward, and two steps back from the Lords of the Realm II days. As an avid lover of Lords of the Realm 2, I'm definitely biased when it comes to what I expected from the game, but I most certinly didn't expect that I was going to need to read a manual to understand how to play Lords III.I actually noticed for the first time in my life, that steam actually sometimes provides game manual links on the store page. Here's the link for the Lords of the Realm III manual if you want to get a hint about what you're getting yourself into:  http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/254860/manuals/Manual.pdfLets break the mechanics down the campaigns to two simple game modes: 1) Fighting/Battle and 2) Economic/Political.Where the battles are concerned not TOO much has changed, you no longer can control individual units, but that's kind of to be expected in this style of game. I found myself comparing Lords of the Realm III to Medieval total war. The bad news is there are other games that do this style of army-combat much much better then Lords of the Realm III... like... the Medieval total war games!Don't even get me started on the tactical-battle camera controls, you can move the camera around easily enough, you can use arrow keys or put your cursor to the edges of the screen to scroll your view around. But do you want to rotate your camera?Guess.... Guess what you do? No really, my review will be here.........Scroll wheel? Nope. Click in the scroll wheel? Nuh uh. Hold down ""R""? You're ready to 3d model in blender. Some type of click or click combo on the ground? Nope.Z.  ....Z! You press and hold Z, and then your camera will rotate. I'm dumbfounded, I didn't figure it out until I discovered the manual on the steam store. (And yes, one could say ""well, that's what manuals are for"", but there are certain game genre's you learn there's a certain type of controls to move about in the world, and it's not like the scroll wheel doesn't already zoom the camera in and out. They could have bound that control a wee bit better and then you wouldn't feel trapped looking at battles in three quarters view for the whole danged fight, that gets tricky when seiging and you can't see behind the wall.)The Economics or political side of the game is where it really tanks the game for me. I've actually put off writing this review because I'm having a difficult time articulating and explaining how THIS part of the game even works. (And again... I played lords II as a kid and loved it, I played the first Lords game, and figured out the controls on my own and could get into it... but this game is... you just gotta see it I'm planning on trying to do a video review on my youtube channel, but I'll try to explain here in the mean time.)


Overview or ""Map View""

			This is the strategic view which lets you see all the goings-ons around the world... or the country at least.		


Your food... religion, armies, and gold income are ALL based on serfs that act as province governors on your behalf. You juggle these suckers all over the place and set them in charge and then get the benefits of the serf you've put in charge. So if you want an army and castle, you need to put a KNIGHT in charge of a province. If you want to provide food for that army you need to put a Serf in charge of a province. If you want gold you need to put a Burgher in charge, and the last type of serf you can put in charge is a priest, because religion is a thing this time... and I haven't gotten far enough into a game to know WHY it's a thing or what it even does.I assume it would have an impact like in the total war series where people are more or less inclined to pick a fight with you if you're on good terms with sir Pope.""Hey Atratzu, that doesn't sound so bad.... why are you being such a negative Nancy about this game?"" Because that's just the first part, there are two ""quality"" levels of Serfs, Lesser Serfs whom are always available but not very effective and generally have many negative perks, and then ""the rest of them"". As you do well in combat more Serfs and knights of higher quality are eager to join your campaign.But now we come to the most annoying part: ""How do you win?"" You win a Lords of the Realm III campaign by controlling all of the states. Sounds pretty easy right? Definitely not, You, as the king or Lord need to wage multiple battles at the same time, IN REAL TIME, so you can be having some armies off batting each other in the faces with swords and arrows, and while they're doing that, you're firing one serf for another newer one which just popped up.Actually this is one of the highest PRAISES I have for the game, I absolutely love the idea of needing to multi-task your nation in this way. It would really make waging war a whole lot more complicated rather then fighting each battle yourself.So let me reiterate: While you're fighting a battle, you can join the battle and personally over see the fight or seige... but while you're in that view, time still goes on, and you could actually be invaded WHILE you're busy giving your undivided attention to a whole 'nuther part of the map.

			I didn't do so hot, in setting up my troops before this battle, but I just wanted a screencap for my steam review anyway.		


Conclusion:  Ugh, there's so much more I could talk about regarding the mechanics in the game, but I think this is enough to give people a general idea of my experience with the game. Even now I'm not really sure if I like or dislike the game. And to me that means it falls right in between, if we're being hard nosed then that means you should go find a better game. If you're feeling forgiving and just want to experience a different game, look no further! This game is for you!Lords of the Realm III is definitely a hit or miss for people. Some say it's the game they were looking for and don't understand why the negativity, others hate it because it's a disappointment compared to the FANTASTIC beautiful strategy masterpiece which was Lords of the Realm II. (I'm definitely exaggerating, Lords of the realm II had it's own fair share of glitches, but the sprites, music, game play, and strategies it implemented made it a charming and cult classic game, this one on the other hand, well... Like I said in the intro, the fact that this was the last game Impression Games made is more then a little revealing.)You're welcome to agree or disagree, you're welcome to pick this game up for yourself and give it a try, I'm giving this game a solid ""Neither"" for recommend or unrecognized.As always, thank you for taking the time to read my review! My Name is Atratzu, and I approve this review.			"

												My father bought this game for me when I was really young and I played the hell out of it back then. I couldn't remember the name of it for the longest time but I finally found it today and grabbed it immediately. Amazing game.			"

												LORDS OF THE REALM 3 IS SURELY ONE OF THE BEST I'VE PLAYED SO FAR. I've bought this game for the first time in 2007 and liked it up to the point of buying a second copy of the game to play while I was a in a job trip just to keep playing. So, this is the 3rd copy of this game and I bought it on Steam just to leave this positive review and bring some justice to this, because truth must be said, this game were far overlooked and put down for a stupid reason: People buy it expecting a sequel to the Lords of the ream 2 (which I also have played long before), when it is not. In fact, Lords of the Realm 3 is far more advanced and complex in many aspects: the game dynamics is completely different, here you should deal with nobles of three types: Clergyman, Knights and Burghers. Each of them have different traits and qualities, providing bonuses or penalties to your armies and controled regions. The actions, decisions and conquests you make in game allows them to be invited to your court. Once they join your cause, they can be assigned to lead armies or regions. Also, Lords of the Realm III has a historycal approach through its scenarios, each of them having victory conditions. If you decide to buy, feel free to add me as a friend so we can play together sometimes.			"

												LoTR2 doesn't work at all for me (windows 7) and I remember it being pretty good. LoTR3 .... works. that's the best thing I can say about it. No economy mangement... only one resource ... I bought the bundle on sale, not sure if any of the games will be worth the dollor or two I spent.			"
