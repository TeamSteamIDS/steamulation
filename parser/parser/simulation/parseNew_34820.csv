												+If you are into Planes or plane games, this can be a fun game.+Feels a bit like Warthunder when in mouse-aim.+Starts really fast, is leightweight, quickly downloaded, etc.-Physics, enemy planes can crash into ground without being harmed, then keep on fliing.~More a game then a simulation, if you are a hardcore simulationist then this might be not for you.-Not as many features as other flight-sims or flight-games.

												Not a bad little flight sim at all. Escpecially as it's only 392mb. Planes look nice and you can fly with a mouse.In easy/arcade mode; it's an easy campaign of maybe 4 hours. I flew into the ground a few times but didn't get shot down. On normal/arcade mode;  enemy planes take a lot more damage and seem to be suicidal as they willl ram you and they seem to be better shots. Not quite as easy. And there's still flight mode which is harder than arcade.Definitely worth $5.. I think I got it < $5 in the Holiday sale.It would most likely be a lot easier to fly the planes with a joystick. You fly a Hurricane then a Spitfire.A twin engine heavy fighter called a Whirlwind a few times and an prototype fightercalled a a Tornado. I don't think they were all that common(?); perhaps late in the war they wouldhave been available.			"

												Do you want to feel like a badass fighter pilot? Do you want to slaughter nazis as a member of the RAF? Pick this game up without hesitation then.+The combat was extremely fun! I felt like an ace the entire time I was gunning germans out of the sky with my wingmen to help me.+-The graphics are decent enough, keep in mind that the game IS from 2008. They could be better but the effort went where it was needed. Into the planes!+-The missions are very short, but there are many of them. The game took me 2 hours to complete.+-About 4 planes to be piloted by you. A decent amount for the game time but there always could have been more.+This game is just some arcadey fun, honestly.-The voice acting is mediocre.-The story is lame.-The cutscenes didn't seem to work on my rig for some reason.This game has its quirks, but it is just so much god damn fun I didn't care. I'd recommened any of you try this out. This reminds me of good old arcadey fun from my childhood. It also has options to increase the difficulty and realism if you aren't a fan of arcadey gameplay. I'll give this title a 7/10.			"

												Having been a fan of aerial combat games for some time, I acquired this as part of a humble bundle and thought I would give it a try. The controls are easy to learn, even on the hardest setting the game isn't very difficult. The graphics are mediocre, but overall it was a fun aerial combat game. I would recommend this to someone if it were on sale, or as part of a bundle where there are other games you are interested in as well.			"

												Combat is fun, but is repetitive and the same every level. Because aiming and hitboxes are inconsistent trying to use rockets is a complete waste, so you just use machine guns every level. The turret levels are the worst I've every played, because you can be shot from guys that are too far away to hit or are over your head and you cant look up high enough to see them, which seems like a huge design flaw and ruins many levels. On these levels the hitboxes and aiming are the worst. Sometimes you need to be directly on a plane to hit them, sometimes you need to be way over their head. You think you get an idea on how aiming works and then you try it again on another plane and none hit. On some planes I moved the aimer on top, slighty in front, way in front, and all around them, and none of the positions registered hitting, which showed lack of polish. No wonder this was a budget title.			"

												A really fun game that's easy enough to get the hang of for beginners. You get to fly four separate aircraft through the course of the game, each with it's own pros and cons- I found myself pursuing different tactics depending on the aircraft I was flying. The game really gives a sense of flying and can present a challenge on higher difficulty levels. Some cons:- Gameplay ends up being somewhat repetative. - Soundtrack is dull (and it's the same thing on loop for every mission)- The physics are unrealistic. The planes don't stall, I've gotten into mid air collisions and somehow still managed to keep on flying with only minor damage. - No artificial horizon, which sounds like a small thing, but having one would really help the player orient him/herself.I got this game on sale for absolute peanuts, so I can hardly complain about the faults. If you enjoy flying, you'll most likely enjoy this game.  "

												The game got really repetitive really fast when all the missions feel the same. There are 23 missions to be played they all felt the same, you go and kill the enemy in the sky over and over again. The graphics got fun to watch when the sky is filled with enemy planes and you get to shoot each one down. It feels like alot of the time that you are the only one shooting all the enemies down even though you are in a squadron of planes. The voice acting was funny in the beginning of the game but after hearing the same thing multiple times it gets old. This game took me around 1-2 hours to beat. If you play it, play it in sections instead of just straight through in one sitting. The controls in the game can be a challenge in the beginning to understand but ounce you get them down then its a really easy game. The game was good but not great. Its repetitive, if you like to kill planes and not have a challenge to it then this is the game for you to burn your time with.			"

Não espere gráficos avançados e muito menos proximo dos atuais pois é um jogo antigo com uns dez anos já, mas é divertido e dá pra passar o tempo nele.recomendo compra-lo somente em promoções pois sempre fica em -90% e com os outros R$7,73 você pega uma ou duas outras coisas.

												While this could be a great game for someone wanting to waste a few hours on a quasi-historical flight game, it is not able to achieve even that. If you use a joystick the game is very unplayable. There are no setting controls and every few levels you get thrown into a situation that you cannot use the joystick for. The ""balance"" for the game is to give targets ridiculous levels of health, and hitting those targets with rockets or bombs is like winning the lottery.			"

												Even with its cheap price, the game's pretty mediocre and your money could be better spent elsewhere.The game can't really be played realistically because even on Advanced I don't feel like I'm flying an actual Hawker Hurricane or Supermarine Spitfire; much of which you fly in the game, and I feel like this experience is much more realized in any of Oleg Maddox's Il-2 Sturmovik games. The voice acting is also a tad annoying, and it seems like most of the British voicework is by the same person. And it doesn't even sound like a WWII-era radio, it sounds much more modern.It also doesn't seem to work with a flight stick very well. I use a Saitek CyborgX stick, and while the throttle seems to work fine, control surfaces don't seem responsive, I ended up running out of ground and exploding on the runway.It's okay as an arcade flying game, much like the Blazing Angels series of games, but what I seek in games like these, which are historic titles, is historical realism.If you want a good flying game that has great flight dynamics, go take a look at Il-2 Sturmovik:  1946. All I can say that's convenient about this game is that it offers a low-requirement gameplay experience for people with low-end computers like myself, but that's about it.			"

												The game is in a 4:3 resolution and it is not changeable = fail. Nobody has played with that resolution since monitors were huge and square and weighed fifty pounds back in 2000. The mouse is way too sensitive even on the lowest setting so I had to change sensitivity with razer synapse by alt+tabbing out. Those actually aren't the main reasons I uninstalled this, just the most heavily glaring problems. I actually gave this game a try. The game textures look like vomit and it is just not fun having to circle around and do several passes to kill targets if you miss. Oh and during the tutorial I right clicked to drop a bomb to try it out then it said for me to drop a bomb on a ground target but the bomb icon was red and I couldn't drop anymore so I was literally stuck and had to restart the tutorial. Getting one bomb in the ♥♥♥♥ing tutorial, great game.2/10, don't bother. Go for Strike Suit Zero or Thunder Wolves for air combat that is fun and not awful.			"

												As one can se from my ""NO"", I'm not recommending you to buy this game (I've got it as the part of the bundle). There are several reasons for that. First of all (and the most important), the game is dead (aka no multiplayer) and the singleplayer campaign lasts no more than 4-4,5h. Furthermore, missions are repetitive (in the most cases shoot down all Nazi planes), through the game one can fly only 3-4 planes (German one are included in the multiplayer, but that doesn't mean much as there are no servers), and voice-acting is awful (repetition started literally after two minutes).  On the plus side, one can choose between the ""arcade"" and ""simulation"" flight and both works well. Response of controls, shooting, and the ""feeling"" of flight are also well executed. It's a pitty that there are no players for real dogfights as it is clear that the multiplayer was focus of this game and it has (had?) nice potential for it.			"

												A very addictive game. Good graphics, well thought-out missions and nice gameplay. Fly the Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire, or when you've unlocked them: the Hawker Tornado or Westland Whirlwind. Some mission even have you being a gunner on the ground or inside a Handley Page Halifax bomber. 23 missions to keep you interested (+2 bonuses) and many different gameplay options changing the realism, making it suitable for anyone new to flight sims or a hardcore gamer.

												ok, Have to say this game does not work on windows 7 64bit. When it launch's you are met with a black screen with sounds, nothing happens untill you press mouse button or keyboard keys, then it will flash and pop-up with teh game in a half sized window screen (no matter what resolution you choose it stays like that).As soon as you make your character and hit play/launch game it crash's with a critical error report. Nothing else is said and it happens each and every single time.Now thinking this must be a compatibility problem i went into properties and told it to run through several differant compatiblity options (in fact i think i tried most of the options going all the way down to windows 98 with no success at all.Therefore i would have to say if you have windows 7 (64bit) dont know about 32bit, it will only give the same issue. I then went and checked out another game thats very simular (but much later) called dogfight 1942 and apparently peeps there are having the same issue's with that game too as i am having with this one :(Therefore i have to make a semi-review of this and warn people not to bother, however if a patch is released and it fix's the issue/s i will re-review the game. Untill then head my warning to save complete dissapointment and if looking at dogfight 1942 check teh forums there for any changes as i will be.			"

												In Combat Wings,you are a pilot in the British Royal Air Force. The game controls pretty well and the graphics aren't that bad,but are a little bit dated.The Gameplay,however,is fun for about an hour and a half and then becomes a bit repetitive. The flying gameplay is a bit mediocre either as the game gives you 2 options to control your weapons. You can either control them in what the game calls the ""Arcade"" style,which is where you use the mouse to move your crosshair and fire, or the Realistic option where your guns only fire forward. The German AI is not too bright and they constantly use the same lines of dialogue. All-In-All the game isn't too bad to pick up on a sale,but doesn't have a whole lot of long term value. Each mission can be finished in around five or ten minutes max and they don't have very much replay value. Also,the game has several different flyable planes,though you are only going to be using one or two.			"
