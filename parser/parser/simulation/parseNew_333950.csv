 ++Best voxel based building system hands down. Ability to combine pieces gives buildings extremely high customizability and sleek ergonomics +Dynamic destruction and advanced physics engine make destroying things just as fun as building them+Creation of medieval inventions such as catapults, drawbridges, elevators, and whatever else you can come up with.+Modding and workshop support for sharing creations --Complex worlds and complex destruction cause massive lag, even on higher end machines -No mode outside of creation yet, survival still a ways off-No multiplayer as of yet-Some types of contraptions are buggy and can break themselvesIf you are into voxel creation games and you can deal with some optimization and minor structural integrity bugs you will have a blast with Medieval Engineers. If you are more into survival and PvP hold off until they add multiplayer and survival, because the building system will perfectly compliment that kind of gameplay.			"

								Build majestic towns and castles, then have them be completely empty and lifeless.  If this is your thing then this is your game!  This game needs some form of AI BADLY!  Space Engineers can get away with limited to no AI but not this version.  Why build a complete town and castle, take over territory, make alliances with other players etc, then it be dead and empty?They have all the framework in place.  If they can manage decent town AI and Knights etc as well as Enemy Lords then this game will explode!  Until then it's a dull husk of what a good game could be.			"

								Its beeen 2 years already. Seems a lot of us early buyers thought the development would be as vivid as it was with Space Engineers. Instead Keen fell back to its dark times where they ripped off their customers with Miner Wars 2081 (promised heavens then stopped it by slapping 1.0 onto it and taking the money to make Space Engineers).The development of ME is slow, somewhat directionless and lackluster.Dont buy until you see some serious development that puts the game forward.

								Please note this review is dated during the Early Access of this game and is subject to change I will do my best to update it when I see fit.Medieval Engineers is a great building game with a ton of promise. I've never personally experience a better voxel system for quick and intuitive building. The game makes creation extremely easy and with the dynamic destruction and physics of it's engine it makes even mistakes or intentional destruction beautiful. On that note this game is very process intensive, demolishing huge castles will lagg even the best of PC's and in it's current build I have crashed quite often. That being said the act of building is spot on and in my honest opinion a very solid base for pretty much ensuring this will be a successful Early Access title. The game needs more content, that's a given, you are limited to what you can build because of lacking tools especially in the spring and rope territory. But with it's unique voxel construction system you can build blocks inside of blocks so if you're creative you can make some absolutely wild stuff in this early build. Be careful though the game does have a very decent structure system and if you don't build your castles with weight in mind they definitely can come tumbling down.Overall in it's current build I give it 7/10 but with updates to the game engine (latency), added materials, multiplayer enabled and survival mode implemented I can seriously see this game being in the high 9s.I don't want to be intrusive with videos but I am makign a series breifly overviewing a lot of the games core mechanics you can watch any at your viewing pleasure.Building Basics

Early Access Review
								As of this writing, the Planets (more like Planet) update dropped, 0.3.1.After nearly six months of hiatus, a lot of things have changed.Under the management of Tim (deepflame), the company has, in my opinion, turned the entire game development around.The game is moving to a sane patch schedule:Every week: Alternating between bugfixes and new minor content (like blocks)Every 6-7 Weeks: Minor feature release (like mechanical blocks)Every 3 months: Major feature release (not sure what this entails, but probably on planets scale)Now, on to the new features:Planets:- This is more like a single planet, but can be fully modded for any size or features, just like in Space Engineers.- Contains ruins and other neat easter eggs.- Yes, you can walk all the way around a planet!Survival research system:- Yes, survival is actually playable now. The default world is still creative, but survival does work. You can now gather resources, including rock on the road, and use them to build components to build blocks.- You start out with nothing. You no longer get starter tools. Minimalist survival experts rejoice!- Building increasingly more complex blocks requires advancing in the research system to unlock higher tiered blocks and tools.Female Engineer:- This may be concerning for some players, like ""why spend time on a female engineer when there are more gameplay elements that should be worked on first?""- In my opinion, having a female playable character in the vanilla game is important for gaining playerbase. People want to have a character that represents them. Gaining more playerbase is always good for a healthy game. People want to play as a character that they feel represents them. For example, I'd prefer a non-bearded model myself.- Mods can handle this, and there are some already, but it's not the same as having the vanilla game support it. Many players only play a game for 30 minutes or so before they decide whether they like it or not. Having that choice up front, without having to learn the modding system, will help people feel more comfortable with the game.Claim Blocks:- You can now claim square areas with a claim block. This protects your area from unauthorized building and mining inside the claimed area. Note this does not protect against normal attacks.- Taxes: You have to pay taxes (in the form of resources) to maintain the claim block and keep your area claimed.Banners:- This is, in my opinion, one of the most immersion providing features to this game. It's well known that in medieval times, banners of the Lord or King who owned an area were on display, and carried into battle. One common example is Cross of Saint George used during The Crusades. Now you can make your own banner and show off to enemies who you are before you destroy them!World Map:- This is my most favorite feature.- The map shows you not only world features, such as mountains, trees, and roads; but also player constructed buildings and rough player location. The map updates dynamically based on player creations (but not voxel changes).- The world map is automatically generated based on the height map used to construct the planet. This means planet modders don't have to do anything special to create a map, it will be created on its own.Fast Travel:- Used in conjunction with the map, this allows the player to quickly travel around the planet, subject to customizable limits (can also be turned off completely).- Analogous to the Jump Drive in Space Engineers.Contextual Menu:- They are still a work in progress, but they are vastly improved over the old clunky interface.There are so many more features and fixes.As for function:- Multiplayer has improved quite a bit, and at least for servers with 16 players or less, is actually playable.- Yes there are bugs, but they are working quickly to stomp them out now.- UI is still clunky in some places (like inventory), but more improvements are coming.- There are issues placing blocks, particularly when trying to aim them to place.Summary:- Has the game improved? Tremendously.- Is it perfectly playable? Of course not, it's still alpha. That said, it's more playable than before.If you are concerned about EA games and aren't impressed with what you've seen so far (why?), then hold back and wait for a few more updates.However if you are as excited as I am about where this game is going, and what is in the game now, then pick it up!Under Tim's leadership, this is really turning out to be a fantastic game. I hope Space Engineers gets the same love and guidance as Medieval Engineers is now getting.			"

Early Access Review
								The 'Now with Planets' update to Medieval Engineers turned it from a Early-Access Alpha into a truly playable game. The content of the game DOUBLED with the Farming update and even added a clear line of progression to the Survival game mode. I state this so that potential players reading this can get an idea of how much different the game has become in just a few months.The Good:Great little sandbox game. You can build amazing structures as well as devices to help you build or to demolish. For example when I am gathering wood, I use a cart that I designed to help bring it back, effectively quadrupling my inventory space.Visuals of the game are pretty good. Looks clean but still keeping with a rustic feel. IMO it looks more 'Roman' than Medieval. But this might be due to the fact that the peasant's ain't got shtuff all over them.Audio is pretty good. Sounds are clear and the music is soothing and ambient mostly. Barking deer is a bit weird. No they don't bark like dogs, they sound like deer but the noise they make makes them easier to find since they get a bit noisy when they get close.Weekly updates either fix bugs, add new content for us to tinker with, both, or sometimes add major changes that impact the entire game. Its always neat to check back on Tuesdays to see what was changed.The Bad:As an early access game in Alpha, it lacks content. Its a sandbox game without any campaigns or scenarios. When you first load in, you won't know what the heck to do. You've gotta just pick a goal and go with it.For survival, the little content in the game (establishing a base camp and farm to sustain yourself) is a bit grindy. Part of the game is simply trying to get yourself situated so most tasks are made easier by constructing mechanisms or simply building up raw resources and the containers to store them. This can get a bit grindy and monotonous.I said the sound is good, before and I still stick to that. But I do have to be honest and say it still has some placeholder stuff. Again its alpha and that is just a polishing issue I'm sure will get fixed eventually, obviously a low priority.The Ugly:Peasants don't work. They are supposed to be little workers that help move stuff around for you. They broke in the Planet update.Barbarians spawn... randomly. Even inside your claimed areas if there is a large enough grass area. This means they can even spawn inside your walls if you walled off a large flat area. They also can spawn nearly on top of you in some cases. They make for interesting foes, and even a source of materials (their weapons can be broken down for ingots), but I recommend leaving them turned off until you're established. If it was like in Minecraft where you had better control of when and where they spawn through ingame measures (like claimed areas restricting their spawn) I'd move this to a good feature.I almost don't want to mention this last one as its probably going to be fixed very very shortly. But the Multiplayer has its issues. Players connected to a host will see interesting placement issues and other oddities. The most glaring issue, inventory desync was fixed four days ago so that is great. Reason I say that the rest will be fixed is Space Engineers just got a fix to its MP issues. ME will be getting that same fix very shortly, maybe even in a few days of this writing. So don't let this issue be the one to dissuade you.Overall:The game is great for what it is. The gameplay is solid. The bugs are few and far between. The game as an early access is doing quite well. The development team that was restructured a few months ago has done a phenomenal job. My biggest complaint is there's not enough of the game yet. But that is surely being worked on. I play ME just about every other day and my favorite part is playing it every Tuesday to see a new set of bugs squished and new content added.If you're looking for a sidegame to add to your library, that will surely evolve over time to be something more. This game will do well by you. Its also a great game to hook up with a few friends on MP (even with the current issues) and work on larger build projects together.I'm hoping in the future when all MP issues are resolved there will be more MP servers available for larger amounts of players to go head to head, Roleplay, or just dink around with community builds. It definitely has potential and I have faith that it will get there. ME has my recommendation.			"

								Coming from my experience in Space Engineers, and seeing what they already have accomplished with this game, it will easily become my favorite game of all time. I can't express how much I have already wanted to invest (despite time constraints with real life obstacles) in this game. It is the game I have always wanted, finally coming true. You may describe it as Skyrim meets Minecraft for those too lazy to add a new game to their vocabulary. Perhaps is the barbaric form of Space Engineers, but to me it is much more. I wanted a game like this from my childhood on, and finally it has arrived. It does a disservice to the creators of the game to try and morph it into a ""child"" or ""combination"" of already created and known games. This game deserves to be in your vocabulary and known from this day forth as Medieval Engineers. If anything, use this game as a basis for future hybrids.			"

								Would not recommend this game. It's essentially a castle building simulator which lacks too much content for it being an already over more than a year old game. I feel like the developers just abandoned the game after it's release because it didn't reach it's expectations. They probably thought it would become just as a hit as Space Engineers is. They were wrong. Even the newest updates don't function properly and the buidling system (where the whole game is about) is buggy. The demolition is done well, but that's the only positive thing i can come up with about this game. There is way more potential (just like Space Engineers), but the developers don't do anything about it. I have given up hope.			"

But you have to make a trip into the woods for each piece.And once you get all your pieces on the table, the model might randomly decide to explode, killing you and your dog.And while you're focused on building your model, a group of soccer hooligans show up, hold you down, and start punching you in the♥♥♥♥♥♥until you die.And then you respawn at your bed, and go on a rampage, murdering everyone in your neighborhood.Creative Mode:You're Doctor Manhattan, floating around in the Alps, building Gondor.Sometimes it blows up too.

								This is an Early Access game, so I can only judge this game by its updates (frequency, value of the updates, etc). Before I do this, I have to warn those who actually want to have tons of fun with this game: This game is actually not really enjoyable at all (at least not for me). Game mechanics are broken, physics on self made war machines are bugged and sometimes your creation will just explode, even if you have no spring or something attached to it. Also controls are weird. So if you expect this to work as good as - lets say Besiege - you should wait a few more months. And then you should remember that Medieval Engineers is or will be more realistic than Besiege.BUT Keen House Software, well known because of it's first 'Engineering'-game Space Engineers are updating really frequent with content updates and bugfixes. In the last week they fixed incredibly much and new content was also added to the game. And there are still huge updates for Space Engineers (planets confirmed, yayy!). So if you want to have a good game in the future, if you are aware this is an early alpha and if you want to test the (incredibly good) destruction engine, you should pick it up now.			"

								The planets update was a step in a direction. It could be forward, backwards, or a side step. All the new features from the planets update are really cool, although I miss being an engineer. I had visions of game being more like it was in the pre-alpha days, more mechanical. There were these special hidden blocks that served mechanical functions like gear ratio, reverse gearing, and windmill block. I want those blocks to be created and updated, instead of portcullis block and door blocks which are all in one solutions for something that you must design as a “medieval engineer” using catch blocks, rope drums, hand cranks, etc. It would be more fun to create your own doors and gates in this fashion. I am aware of performance issues this may cause. Of course all of this is still possible in the current state of the game.tl;dr being an ""engineer"" is no longer required			"

								Update 4. march 2015: New patch today/yesterday introduces breakable ropes and rope hooks that can release a rope at a certain angle (perfect for making trebuchet siege weapons). The breakable ropes snap at contact with another block, a barbarian or the player. This is excellent news and gives a lot of possibilites! A great creative physics playground just got even better.The ability to remove broken blocks automatically is also added and makes repairing a castle much easier. No more walking into broken blocks to push them out of the way in order to place a new block. Thank you Keen Software House!! Saves so much time when your ridiculously high ""princess tower"" collapses for the third time!Also added was the ability to switch between day and night in creative mode, so you can see your pretty castle with torches and other light sources in the dark. Very pretty! My dream castle became even more wonderful in the dark :-)They also made a rudimentary survival mode that makes you die if you fall down too high or get stuff in your head (like blocks, barbarians clubs or artillery projectiles). So far, they are keeping their ""patch every tuesday"" promise. 11/10---Original review below---This game is going to be brilliant. Already it is incredibly fun, despite it being a very early and unfinished game. There are quite a few bugs (to be expected from early access), so if dealing with that is something you absolutely loathe I recommend waiting a bit before trying it. Knowing the developer after playing a lot of Space Engineers, they make patches and improvements all the time. Normally I am skeptical to all early access games, because you always fear it will turn into vapor ware and be abandoned, but I had no such reservations about this one.Since release there have already been several patches and hotfixes, including one today that gave us more blocks to play with, including more catch blocks (essentially hinges), round timber logs, as well as ""barbarian"" bots that basically run around the map looking for king statues to destroy. This is excellent news for those of us who enjoy making horrible medieval traps of all kinds (dev has a hilarious video showing this). The bots can be turned on or off depending on what you want to do, so they don't mess up your perfect dream castle if you don't want to.Even with all the current limitations and bugs, the game is already amazingly fun to play. Keep in mind though that it does require a bit powerful pc to run properly. Especially destruction of blocks can slow down the computer.Finally, a tip: If ropes, rope drums, hinges or physics in general start acting strange, try saving and going out to main menu and reloading the game. It sorts out most problems.			"

Early Access Review
								Perhaps the most enjoyable sandbox I've played since Minecraft..for the 3 hours I managed to play it, at least.The building mechanics are intuitive and for the most part easy to use, and the destruction engine is reminiscent of Red Faction: Guerrila. If you want to understand that last part, watch someones video on YouTube.However, whilst I do recommend this game it is only in the hope that the developers will improve on this. The game is perhaps the most unoptimised I have ever played, with lag occuring almost every time you destroy something. The game also lacks a large number of objects to build with. It would be even better if it had a Besiege swing to it, with AI that actually moves, interacts etc. My PC isn't the best, I will be using an i5 as of tomorrow, which may combat the problems with FPS drops during destruction, but what really is disappointing is I can no longer play the game. My graphics card does qualify above the recommended requirements, but now whenever I try to play the game I am given an error. After trying the troubleshoots people have come up with it still doesn't work, and I hope that the developers will get back to me with a solution. I do believe it is because my graphics card uses Nvidia's Kepler microarchitecture, which struggles to use DX11.1. So, 7/10 in the hope that the developers grow this game, optimise it, and solve the issues people are having with DX11.1.#Edit: 2 hours later, it's been fixed, I can now play. They've added multiplayer and sounds. Best game ever.			"

								This isn't really a review, but a note to those looking to buy this game.As of the release of this title, you only have Single Player Creative, you will not be able to play with friends just yet, nor is there any survival mode.So unless you're very eager to mess around in Creative Mode, I would recommend that you wait until it is further developed.The physics and destruction are a lot of fun, and for being so shortly after release I would say it's pretty decently optimized.You can tell that it's still Space Engineers, which I think is a good thing. I think this game is very promising, but as I said, unless you're into creative mode and wanna get a early peek at what it's gonna be like - do not buy it.If there was Multiplayer and Survival mode, then yes, I would highly recommend it. :)			"

								Not recommending this early on, obviously my **OPINION** but I feel like there isn't much to do.I understand that it is early access so it's more about getting everything to work rather than having things to do, but from the same developers of Space Engineers I just found it a bit meh. ProsGood OptimisationGood DestructionNice GraphicsGood blocks currently in the gameGood Construction SystemConsNot many blocksExpensive early access game for the content.Certain mechanisms will not work after relaunching the game - Locking up of contraptions - Etc.Excessive destruction - It doesn't take much to destroy a solid stone blockConfusing to start with - No gradual way to ease the player into the game.HopesI hold out hope purely because it's from the same people that have made space engineers, it's fun but at this current state it should be left until a few more blocks and systems have been added and any kinks worked out.TL;DRGood game, not much to do. Wait until there is more.EDIT: 31/03/2015: It's getting better, but it's fairly slow. It's showing promise but I'd still say wait a bit.			"

								Over my time owning this I've seen a couple updates. All updates seem to be little tweaks. Meanwhile, I'm hitting a tree with an axe, getting 5 large stone from it, and the ground disappears beneath me. Servers are laggy. Graphics cause lag on a brand new built system with 1060 graphics and more RAM than anyone needs -> badly optimized programming. It's likely just a matter of time until Keen admits that they've all but dropped this baby and move on to their next Early Access heist. I really wanted to like this game, it's just so beyond ""buggy"" that it is nearly intolerable to play.			"

								I like to go in blind, so I started out with in survival mode with everything at whatever defaults the devs thought best. Here's my experience so far:I awoke in a rather picturesque field of grass and flowers next to a cart. I pushed the cart and it moved easily, which seemed like good news, but I'd save that for later. I immediately headed for a forest I saw in the distance as that looked like a good place to start my search for useful resources. Arriving at the edge of the forest I immediately grabbed the axe I had conveniently been provided and chopped down a tree. The tree fell on me and I died.I awoke again next to my trusty cart and headed in a different direction. This time I wandered until I came across an abandoned house. It wasn't the most interesting thing I'd ever seen, so I wandered back toward the forest. Noticing my growing hunger, I looked around for food and saw an unsuspecting deer. I tried to get the deer. The deer ran away. I searched some more and found some mushrooms. At this point I was quite hungry so it seemed worth the risk. I ate the mushrooms which turned out to be nothing more than edible mushrooms. I wandered back to the tree I had chopped down and tried to pick it up. Apparently a 175kg log wouldn't fit in my backpack, so I chopped it into smaller pieces and carried them back to a relatively level area in the field to start building some shelter.The game is absolutely not done, and a cursory glance at the forums will show you a definite weak spot in project management, resulting in a somewhat unstructured and chaotic release cycle. To their credit, they specifically list Project Manager as an open position, so I think they're aware.The bottom line is this game is fun in its current state, and promises much more. If you like survival, building, medieval times and being crushed by falling trees, this game is absolutely for you.10/10 would be crushed again.			"

								This game gives countless of hours of building things. Creative aspects are more important than destructive ones. When you spawn in a catapult in Castle Siege, it is accomplished using blueprints. You can easily download and publish blueprints, and have a stack of offline blueprints for your convenience. Most of your creations are either whole worlds or just blueprints, and there's some modding potential besides that.I recommend making keenswh.com one of your start sites in case you would like to stay informed on this product. Medieval Engineers has lots of features planned for it, so stay tuned.The only downside that I can think of is that it craves a powerful computer to play it without problems. "

I bought it when the game was first available for early access and tried it out right then. It was really nice to see and build my ""own"" castle. Then i thought i'd just wait a few month until there is more content...like doors for example. A couple of month later there were still no real content updates and there still aren't many. Just a month ago the devs finally released a castle gate after over a year of waiting. Small doors are still nowhere to be found. It is really sad but the way it looks the game will have content that would make the game playable in around 2030. So i suggest to not buy it until they finally get some real ingame content going.

The core features are implemented and it is very playable with several game modes. (creative, survival, castle siege- which is a awesome gamemode worthy of much praise)However, the game is incomplete and is missing a variety of weapons and armor as well as items in general. It'd be nice to eventually see character customization and different armors, as well as other wildlife to hunt. The world is plenty large, so some generated ruins or towns would be nice too.All in all a great game with alot of potential that I will definitely keep an eye on.			"

Well...- You need to eat more frequently than Jabba the Hutt, else you starve and die.- You can't move stones to build stuff, so you have to build where they fall.- How the hell do you put a goddam roof on four walls!? - Frequent random / weird deaths - Chops tree, walks into chopped wood, dies...wtf?- Loads up new game, wanders into wood, finds random NPC running towards me. Gets killed by NPC with a club...eh!?- Building anything is so fiddly it hurts- Dreadful controlsIt's like the dev's tried to do something different, got fed up and decided to concentrate on Space Engineers instead (which is a far better game)May get better in the future, but for me it's a ""no"" at the mo.

								This game is like Space Engineers... Except Medieval. Build castles, villages, hamlets, etc. and then burn them all to the ground! My only gripe is that multiplayer servers are far too laggy to connect to, but I'm pretty sure most of the probelms regarding that are on my end. 8/10 would bang			"

								Unlike what people say Medieval Engineers is NOT DEAD.  Those of us who check their forums have kept up to date with the games progress as the new project lead Tim ""Deepflame"" has revamped and revitalized the game, and bruoght it into a state where it is fun to play.  His hard work over the past 6 months has paid off, and the game is finally ready for release, with the big update being the planet that the game is now played on.I know keen had a bad past with Miner Wars, but they seem to have put that behind them and are hard at work making their current games great.Bottom line, the game is fun, the devs are great, and comunicate with the comunity on their forums.

								This game is litterally the Medieval version of Space Engineers (as intended) and I love it so far! Same intuitive building system, but with added terrain tools. Workshop integration right from the start and I'm assuming a lot more blocks will be added over tim. There's a bug here and there, but this game is far above the average playability level of an early acces game. Pick it up for the low price it's at now or even with 25% discount if you own Space Engineers already (till march 4/5?).Edit: After doing some research, I am dissapointed about one najor thing. The 'Engineer' part of the game. A lot of stuff from the trailers and even the background clip in the main menu is NOT in the game. No cogs, gears, winches, waterwheels or ropes to balls (for a trebuches).			"

								April 2017: Have a bit of imagination and make this review slightly more positive, but not too much, I am saying that only because they started growing a sense of humor lately, not because they added pulleys, for they did not. <-- YES THAT'S WHAT WE ARE WAITING FOR, PULLEYS, not you not adding pulleys.When I bought this game, not so long ago (october 2015), multiplayer was stable and there was much to do. One day later, a patch came in, and multiplayer was not stable anymore, and it has not improved since. But on the plus side, the more patches comes, the less there is to do. Give it a few years and you will be able to place a prefab building, no more cluttering of your toolbar with useless things like foundations, walls, stairs ... give it ten years and you will be able to do nothing.This game is a pearl where patches get rid of things you can do and add bugs.Well it is almost playable again, not entirely but you can have fun for 2 hours in multiplayer building things and then 2 hours destroying it with client-vibrating siege engines. Yes, it still is glitchy but maps works at least.The development pace is way too slow though. with maybe one significant patch every 9 months, it will only take 12 more years until that one reaches puberty, 18 until you can play with it.Here you go cpt, I updated the date, and yes I tried the content days ago, it's a step in a direction, I am unsure if it's the right one though, the rest remains very current and I am trying not to mention your UPGRADE to DX 11.1 which♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off greatly, especially since W7 patch for dx11.1 is just a compatibility upgrade and not an upgrade at all.-I will attempt to describe how the game goes:Build something for 2 hours.Sometimes it crumbles, so extend that duration by 2 additional hours.Build a siege engine, no, not a battering ram, it won't work. Not a ballista, it will fire 5 metres in front of you. build a trebuchet, it's easy. takes 10 minutes.now choose one of three options:Singleplayer: FINE but repetitive.Multiplayer as server: Same.Multiplayer as client: Said trebuchet will vibrate as if it was possessed by some evil spirit, eventually disintegrating itself after a while, usually it will have killed you first if you attempted to tame the beast. Double the fun if you made it rotary, triple if it is a gigantic one.So. in order to improve the game:Get rid of vibrations, use eggboxes.Implement pulleys, everything was done with pulleys.Implement pendulums,I wanted to build a clock. Wait ! I know what you are going to say, I can build a pendulum, let me rephrase: Please make the ropes have an elasticity coef below 1, perpetual motion is not funny when it's occuring from bottom to top.Oh and belts &| chains would be nice, yes I am talking about the mechanical ones.Thankyou			"

								In Medieval Engineers, you can build whatever you want. A village? A castle? That part of Lord of the Rings? Yup. You can recreate all of those in this game with a wide selection of building blocks. There are also decorative blocks to make the inside parts feel less empty.Once you've built something, the second part of the game comes into play : Destroying it! You can build catapults and trebuchets to obliterate all of it in spectacular fashion.What I like a lot about this game is the constant updates every Tuesday, that add various things and fix annoying bugs.The Steam Workshop is also a great part of this game. You can see what others have created, such as castles or even floating islands.Performance wise? I get around 60 frames per second on max graphics on a GTX 1070, which is very satisfying.In a nutshell, I would totally recommend this game.And shameless self plug : if you were wondering what they added in the relaunch update :

								Well, it's launch day and that means everyone who's been drooling over this game is rushing to buy it.  Myself included.  That said, there might be a few people out there with questions.  Hopefully this will answer them.Medieval Engineers is an absolutely beautiful game.  Everything from the folliage to the map-edge backdrop is very well done.  The music is perfect, and brings you a true sense of that medieval feeling.  In addition the physics engine is the best I've seen in a building game.  This game is well worth the money.  That said, there are a few drawbacks to the current version of the game so I'm going to let you know what you'll be getting into.  Note:  This list ONLY applies to the EARLY ACCESS LAUNCH.  I have no doubt things will be updated in the coming days and months.  So here we go;- No Survival Mode.- No Multiplayer.- Map size is limited, although ""Normal"" is a pretty decent size.- Very limited selection of parts.- Building collapses can cause heavy lag.- Heavy load times on map entry.- Limited rotation of some parts.- During building it feels too much like ""Space Engineers"", lacking it's own identity.So, do I recommend this game?  HELL YES!  That said, if you're on the fence about purchasing it I'd watch the updates for now.  Wait until more parts are added and survival mode + multiplayer is included.  That way you won't be disapointed with your purchase.Otherwise, if you can deal with the limited state of the current game and trust solely in the knowledge that it will be improved, BUY IT NOW!			"

								Medieval Engineers is the prequel of the popular game Space Engineers. In the game, you play an engineer with the task of building a new castle for your feudal overlord.After many plot twists and backstabs in this political scenario that makes Crusader Kings 2 look like Sesame Street, you must hide the last remaining Engineers in an abandoned mineshaft whereupon an elevator is required. After many failed attempts, the elevator develops conciousness and physics-defying controlled flight with you onboard and travels to the stars.And then Space Engineers starts.10/10 Would develop a self-councious medieval transmission system again.

								Hmm, I gave it a thumbs up, because it has potential..Early access so it's rough...beyond rough...Things that need attention:STOP with the Farking PvP mechanics! - my god it's listed as survival game..you are making the mistake of all survival games instead of getting people to work together you are driving wedges into the server communities..Character controller - the Unity character controller you chose is god-awful...Can't climb, can't jump over single block terrain..get's stuck in crevice terrain...third person camera wobbly(rocks back and forth when moving it)Survivabilty - No water!! seriously a person can live 3 weeks without food but only 72 hours without water. Food...eating 50 items every hour from foraging/farming just to keep food bar up...Some good points to consider:Voxel/marching cubes terrain is very nice...even 60+Fps on Highest settings using Nvidia GTX 1070. Very good view distance.Has potential to be AAA game in a few years.Building structures has pretty good mechanics...although not very intuitive...takes some getting used to...like any game with build mechanics..I liked how you can move the blocks in horizontal direction(need look at turning for vertical and diagonals)ALL in ALL, it DOES have potential....In 3 maybe 4 years of serious coding....Recommendation, wait for sale or more content.

								While this game is still heavily under development, it is already reaching unique heights. I mostly played online servers as there is so much more incentive when playing together. To be honest, it was a bit hard to find larger populations online, and i sincerely hope the game succeeds in providing a performance boost, and deeper pve/pvp/survival experience over time to improve on this.This game made me laugh and cry. I made a dozen of new steam friends all over europe, and for a while we really had some nice thing going on. It made me real life friends worry about my state of mind. I have clocked 700 hours in this game, and i have to lay it down for a while caus it started threatening my sanity. i'll be back, i'm sure.That being  said, this game is not for everyone at this point. It is not a casual game . The game demands high tolerance, struggling through the typical pain of early acces distortions.. occasional breaking of content, server wipe, annoying bugs, low player counts, a somewhat steep learning curve... demanding performance..  and a lot of time.underneath, there is a golden experience. If you like solving problems with wood, building and breaking stuff, digging tunnels through mountains, with a fair amount of roleplaying and making your own story, admiring creations of other people , gathering together to set up farms , elevators, balistas, counterweight devices, kung fu killer machines, trade centers- if you like dropping stones on your virtual friends head, have some friendly sieging engagements, firing a dozen chained balls through the air, copying buildings and churches of medieval times... it is really there. You just need to find the people to play with. You can start over and over and it never has to be the same. The player community is generally very friendly and supportive. The game attracts people with patience and determination and griefing is generally frowned upon. The commitment of the development team can be felt in many ways. Problems which are properly reported are usually adressed immediatly. After important updates developers and team leader can be found roaming the online servers to get feedback. I give this development team full credit and surely don't agree with anyone stating after -20 played hours 'game has been abanded' or something like that. It is untrue. on 5 different occasions i reported issues on the ME forum, and they were all but one fixed within two weeks. i am amazed by this level of interaction.			"

								Not going to lie; I really tried to give this the benefit of he doubt, and after many hours of space engineers, I figured why not. At the moment, I\'d advise everyone to still hold off until they release WAY more content and easier-to-use items/interfaces. With space engineers, things are reletively intuative. With this - even in creative mode- it is one of the most frustration experuiences in learnign a game i can remember. It looks awesome, but if you are not building a castle and destroying it, there is no other purpose. Trying to build other items is not really a joke, but rather an annoyance since things dont\' seem to snap where they should, and items do not have an instinctual purpose. With such little content out there to help teach you and answer FAQ\'s, this game is just not worth the $20 it currently is. Again, EVEN IN CREATIVE mode, it lacks appeal and dissapoints; I have more fun with Legos and I\'m 34.			"

In addition to being a fun sandbox/world-builder, Medieval Engineers is an extremely powerful engine for re-creating history. Even in its early-release Alpha stage, it already offers so much. You can build a town that's only known now in ruins & stories, and then explore it -- house by house, room by room. Attack it, defend it, live in it for a while.

Structural integrity isn't nearly as fleshed out as it could and should be (this needs a lot of work, given that it's a big selling point of the game).Specifically, though, I take issue with how block rotation works.I will say, though, that rope is the most useful thing.

Building stuff that actually needs to be structurally sound AND well defended AND with an elevator so you dont need to walk stairs AND with a 5-arm catapult on each tower for the looks3. Watching said castle crumble in a realistic way4. Terrain and contraptions and castles r so pretty5. Survival is going to be cool, have to build cranes and carts and stuff to haul resources and all, especially with multiplayer (Imagine co-op operating a castle with dozens of other players, against barbarians)Updates once a week, game is fun even now (day of release and before that during pre pre alpha release) when everything is a bit buggy and there is nothing but creative mode with very few block types. Still plenty of fun building catapults and trebuchets and carts and cranes and elevators and castles.			"

								So much time has passed and so little has changed, I can't see them ever getting this game to a finished state, the updates (when there are any) are so small and insignificant that they are not even worth reading about, multiplayer remains unplayable and survival is just a boring, lonely, repetitive experience.It was fun smashing up buildings for the first hour, seeing the unique destruction system, but paying £15 for that really is not worth it.4/10, uninstalled, will reinstall if they ever bother to put any effort into it's development.

								Has had almost nothing significant done since it was first put into early access and there's very little content in the game in the first place. It rarely gets any sort of new content, it's pretty much a side project that feels like it's been abandoned. There are still things in the trailer from well over a year ago that aren't in the game yet, with no indication of when or if they'll actually be added anytime soon.Edit: A developer posted a comment to say they'd updated the game with a big update. After looking at the update notes...it does absolutely nothing to fix the problems i have with the game. None of the new features do anything to improve the core of the game; the biggest 'feature' added is planets, which pretty much just gives you a much bigger map. A big map is nice, but that doesn't help that the game is still lacking actual content and things to do on that map. Infact because of this update i'd recommend it even less. Why was this decided to be more important than something like the mechanical blocks that the trailer showed off nearly 2 years ago that are still missing?			"

								The game is a lot of fun, and has many of the core features down pretty well, and is surprisingly well polished for an early access but a few small bugs keep it from being great, for example random crashes and the ropes not breaking on trebuchets, but this is something that should be fixed soon. Honestly if you're not sure on if you want the game or not i would wait until its more stable.

								Can't say I'd recommend this game to anyone except when it's heavily discounted.This game is basically a castle building simulator, nothing more and nothing less. I think KSH (developers) made this as a tech demo or something in the office then decided to release it for $20 upon realizing they could bilk loyal Space Engineers fans out of money.Oh yeah, it also has the semi-poor performance/bug issues that crop up in Space Engineers as well.

								When it works, there's clearly the kernel of a decent game in here. It's clearly received less attention than Space Engineers, but there's still definitely something interesting and unique here.The building system is very flexible (especially compared to Space Engineers), letting you actually create believeable structures rather than cubes with 2m thick walls. THe destruction system is also really, really nice - buildings seem to collapse realistically, and walls splinter and form rubble in a hugely satisfying way. Structural integrity is satisfyingly frustrating - if you don't pay attention, buildings can collapse under their own weight.All that said, it's still clearly an early access game. There's virtually no AI to speak of, and the netcode is comparable to Space Engineers (dodgy af). To be expected, I suppose, in a game with a physics system as elaborate as this, but still frustrating. There's also some very iffy performance issues - again, to be expected in early access, but getting 0.5fps in the middle of a field on a GTX 1070 is rather frustrating.Overall, not bad at all - even if you just download castles from the Workshop and lob weights at them with a trebuchet.

								Medieval Engineers is great because it has realistic  physics, great creativity potential, and gorgeous scenery.Unfortunately, I have one con: it is quite hard to make an ""engineer-like"" creation, due to the complex physics used to create something of the sort being hard to manipulate and figure out what works and what doesn't. But that is what the game is all about, and one can easily look up how to do it on Google (or Bing, Yahoo, whatever you use) how to do it, so the given con will not count as a negative.So overall, great game! Unfortunately, my wee Laptop can't even get like 10 FPS, so the game is barely playable on my part :steamsad:   But if your PC can handle the game, then I highly recommend it!!!!			"

								I've had plenty of fun with Space Engineers, and Medieval Engineers is basically that, but with actual physics and a Medieval theme (go figure).Given the massive progress of Space Engineers, and this game being made by the same developers with their own dedicated team (as in not taken from the SE team) working on it, I'd say it's definitely worth picking up right now if you're willing to wait.If you aren't, wait until the game gets multiplayer and survival mode. It will be more than worth the price of admission then.Also, just in case you didn't read the store page, don't go into this game expecting it to be medieval Minecraft. With the structural integrity system this game has, you can't build the sort of fantastical structures you could in Minecraft. Hell, you probably won't even be able to build a small house properly on your first try. Yes, you can disable it, but why would you do that?			"

Early Access Review
								Still slow as hell.  The situation is you start out as a peasant and get to build a castle and siege engines.  For reasons that will be explained later, I never got so far as building the more advanced items.  Lack of an in game tutorial is still an issue, although there is an online one if you dont mind streaming it.  To start, you have to gather the basic resources to make some simple tools and workstations.  The tools help you gather resources faster and to build your fort.  I recommend keeping it simple at first, just a box with a door.  You will need to research better wals and so you will need to craft a research station, which can be built at the workstation.  Hence the need for a tutorial.The first thing you will notice is you will begin to starve to death frequently, and you need metric♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of food to fill you up, Im talking like 20 pumpkins.  I suppose the crafted food would be better, but again, I never got that far.  I built a small fort only to find out that doors are some kind of mythical super tech that you have to research once you have metal mining up and going.  So again, I didnt get to it.  Now normally I would give a game more than a couple hours on a re-review, but honestly, the framerate was giving me a headache.  I'm talking 5-7 frames a second on a quad core processor with a fairly new video card.    Coupled with the fact you cant trurn the food 'feature' off made it mildly unpleasant to re-review this title.  It's not a bad game if you can overlook the warts.  Gameplay -Probably the most important tech to research is farming.  If for no other reason so you can make bread, A simple recipe that fills you up.  Only requires wheat which you can find growing wild.  I recommend waiting to start building your first castle until you find an iron deposit, preferably near a forest.  Its a bit of a pain to find iron as it is quite rare.  Making it a strategic resource.  It can be found by looking for large areas in the grass where the grass looks dead.  Its yellow and red instead of green.  It took me about an hour of running around to find a deposit.  Once you find a spot, dig down anywhere from 2-10 blocks and you will find an iron deposit.  You can tell because the stone will be rust colored instead of white.  Once you have a deposit, you need to site your castle.  You can of course put yoru castle on top of the iron deposit.  The deposit I found is in the side of a mountain so thats not the easiest thign to do, so I started the castle about halfway between the mine and the nearest forest.  If you have barbarians turned on you may want to rush developing better weapons.  Sword and crossbow come in handy, especiialy the crossbow if you have your defences set up so you can shoot the barbarrians attacking your gates.All in all, It is a good game, and I would recommend it if not for the serious lag issues.  I've heard all the excuses about it still being early access, but seriously, the game has been under development for at least a year and the issues keep getting worse not better.			"

								Keen Software House brings us yet another ""Engineering"" game. This time however not in space but sort of safely on the ground.Those who are familiar with Space Engineers will certainly enjoy this game, the controls feel very much the same and the building mechanics ave a lot in common. However, there are some very vital differences, I'll list them later on.Those who are new to the ""Engeneering"" saga of KSH may need to put in a little more effort to get the hang of the controls and building mechanics but with a bit of perserverence everyone get's the of this game.The game is still in pre alpha, this means that everything is subjected to change, and crashes are not always inevitable. The game runs smoothly tough and feels like a proper early acces title. KSH is known for updating Space Engineers weekly, the same will probably happen to Med. Engineers. The major building mechanic differences:1) You can choose to build objects ""off the grid"" wich means they are not snapping to the ground or other objects, this means you can build objects that are moveable by e.g. walking in to them or making moving contraptions.2) You can now build multiple pieces of wall and a like in 1 bulding square. Buildings get more compact that way, something that is still not available in Space Engineers.3) Large and small blocks can easily be build on or to eachother without uses of converters and the sorts.4) Properly breaking objects, walls and the like.5) Optional (but recommended) building integrety wich means you got to really plan your builds to make sure they don't break under they own weight.TL;DR:It's a great and promissing pre alpha game that will certainly warm your heart if you like building, planning, medieval styles and a great dev team that updates their games reguarly and listens to feedback.Now buy it already and get constructing!

								After 5 months of hard remake under developer, our hero Tim Toxopeus, ME became something amazing. (He even visits servers and searches how to further improve this game him self, which blew my mind!), while releasing patch with features/fixes every week! There is so much you can do, whether you are creative arty player or survival focused. In creative mode, you can fly and create amazing castles, houses and devices and even terraform terrain to your liking. Just check workshop even for these beatiful amazing creations (awesome community and mods) working clock for example).  In Survival mode, you gather resources to build your structures and have to consider Structural integrity feature (too high walls may crumble), find and cook different food, create blueprints to learn, making mechanical traps against barbarians and much more. In multiplayer you claim territory for your House that you join, build clever castles on strategic positions, make traps and defences, and siege other houses using mechanical siege machines that you design your self. There is plenty of Role Play possibilities if you are into that too! Did I mention that you play on actual round PLANET? Beatiful environment with hidden ruins, treasures and caves, deers running around and day cycles with night. For this low price, Medieval Engineers are very good buy you WON'T be disapointed with. There are few bugs that most open world sandbox games have, but nothing immediately game breaking. Game is awesome as of now and it will only get even better after time with new features released every few weeks. Sandbox games are my favorites and ME is one of the best I've played. Now go and support our amazing active developers for all their hard work, to deliver you true medieval engineering!			"

								BASICALLY:Medieval Engineers is a wonderful game for anyone who is a big fan of middle age time period. It can appeal to almost any gamer, whether it being architecture (really cool structural integrity too), a survivalist (fun and immersive survival mode (more on that later)), and great potential on the PVP side of things. If you want to build medieval castles, villages, kingdoms even- this is the game for you. The game has both building and survival modes. Survival mode will immerse you into a role; build your kingdom, recruit friends, make enemies. Theres a couple issues with this, however.BIG CONS:1. EMPTY WORLDS   - Since its in EA, you could give them a pass. But currently, theres next to no animal life at all. This can make everything seem a little boring at some points of time, but half the fun of EA games are waiting for new exciting stuff to release :D2. NO MULTIPLAYER POPULATION   - While you can find one or two servers with active players, its not a lot. This isnt that big of a deal because singleplayer can be really fun, but multiplayer is good for roleplayers, PVPers, or if you tend to get lonely.  Find a multiplayer server if you can.3. BUGS   - Do not buy this game expecting it to be bug free. This is probably one of the buggiest survival games I've played- but it is still playable, and almost every weekly patch comes with its own set of bug fixes.BIG PROS:1. GENRE   - This is one of the best medieval building/medieval survival games you could buy.2. ROLEPLAY   - Even if your not into roleplay, you will find it hard to not roleplay if your on a server. And thats good! :D3. ARCHITECTURE   - Really cool, somewhat realistic building. Theres structural integrity, which means you can't just build stone cubes and expect to live in it. This keeps buildings true to medieval architecture.OVER ALL 7/10:   - Bugs are really bad in this game, they can screw you over. If there were a normal amount of bugs, it would be an 8/10.   - Imense potential; Good ideas,  Good development team, etc.			"

								Look. I wanted to like this. I watched some videos of it on Youtube and it seemed fun. Point is, the Youtubers made it seem like fun while it actually isn't. It's poorly optimised, it's buggy, it's going nowhere, and it doesn't feature much gameplay as it mostly is about building castles and trying to figure out how catapults actually work. But once you've done that, there is nothing else to do.I'd ask for a refund if I could, but I've bought the game way before the Steam refunding system even existed. So yeah. Maybe the game will get better, but the developers are clearly not focused on this game (as Space Engineers is their main project), thus increasing the chance that they'll say that it's finished and abandon ship, leaving this game behind as a massive wreck.

All in all a very fun game with a lot of potential, if you like space engineers you will probably like this as well.			"

								Buying Early Access Games always leave me quite concerned. There are a lot of them that promise much and deliver very few, taking too long to finish or even being released without getting finished at all. But THAT'S NOT THE CASE with Medieval Engeneers.There has been only a few months since this game has been released in Alpha and it is ABSOLUTELY ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME already!! Keen Software House (the Producers) also produce Space Engeneers and both games are very well built. They are constantly being updated, mostly in a weekly basis (with bug fixes in a daily basis), and problems are very rare.Here goes a short synopse of what you get from this, yet brute but already quite refined, Diamond: - You get to build amazing Medieval Structures of Stone, Wood and Iron from scratch. - You can terraform the land, raise mountains, dig deep mines and build whatever you like upon it.- Construction is made through a very cleaver system of Stackable Blocks, which sometimes can be overlaid in order to create even more awesome composite blocks.- Blocks are affected by real Phisics. Weight, Height and Impact affect the blocks and they even crumble when overloaded.- EVERYTHING IS DESTRUCTABLE! You can build large fortresses just to have a lot of fun destroying it later on. And destroying it isn't only realistic as hell, but it's also very very fun!!- You can already build a wide variety of buildings (from tiny poor villager houses to might Castles and Citadels), and every week more and more blocks are released into the game.- The game also provides easy access to even more blocks from Steam Workshop's independant developers.- You can build not only fixed buildings, but also complex mechanisms like Lifts, Porticulis, Draw Bridges, Catapults, Onagers, Trebuchets, Balistas, Windmills, etc. AND THEY ACTUALLY WORK!!!This game is Heaven for your Creativity and only the sky is the Limit.I recommend this game, I recommend the producers and I also recommend buyinf it even on Early Access. If you liked to play with Legos when you were younger, you are sure to love it as much as I do.			"

About a year ago I hard about this game. I won't lie, I got super excited about it. In fact I got so excited I binge played Banished and Stronghold. I didn't want to get it yet because it was pre-alpha (very few pre-alpha games are good. Empyrion Galactic Survival is a good game and is in pre-alpha) and it would be too buggy.In case you don't know about the game, ME is you and some friends in a giant pit surrounded by mountains with a forest smack dab in the center (at least on our map) and you have to bum rush for items like food and such. You build a castle and combat your others of the game and can build an army of peasent's to do your bidding. We never got far enough to see WHAT the peasents would do, however, as the game is now only in alpha and the many bugs left in the physics engine would kill the peasents. I want to say now: these guys are building from the ground up. They might be using unity or something, but I am still in awe at how complex this game actually is in it's early stages.On to what I don't like here. As I said there are many physics bugs, however not so severe that if you get stuck in a crick in a hole you get shot into the atmosphere (this happens in 7 Days To Die, another good pre-alpha game). No, instead if you have your peasents doing generic things, like gather wood and stone, and have them flop it into a pile somewhere things have a tendency to slide wherever they want. EVERYthing on the map is a hill. You cannot go anywhere in the basin and not be climbing or going down something, Whether that is a bug in map generation or something, no clue. Because the items move around the AI trips over everything, including their own feet (which is really freaking funny to see). Bjorg and Helga can be hauling wood and stone while Ingvarad is organising wood, but then Bjorg hits Invar with a stick, nothing is actually no-collided in the engine, and then Bjorg, Invar, Helga, You, Half your castle, AND probably some trees are up in the atmosphere. Then some raiders run by and steal your♥♥♥♥♥♥ did I mention that? Fun fact the raiders are no-collided but nothing else is. You can walk through them. WTF.Next to that there is no tutorial. The game has been out a year and all you get is an obnoxious block of text that never goes away that says ""HIT F1 TO SEE SOME♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; and then you have SEVEN PAGES OF KEYSTROKES to go through to learn how to build a wall. A freaking wall. Yeah you start out with some walls, but you have to figure this♥♥♥♥♥♥out like they did way back in 903. Now that I think about it that it kind of ingenius.....This would be fixed if looking at stuff would say ""Hit T to Pick Up"" or ""Hit C To Open Crafting Menu!"" In fact, if they would fix the damn inventory system that would be cool. I like it; it actually reminds me of games like High Seas Trader (dos game from 1992/5) but jesus♥♥♥♥♥♥man, you could do better..... Look up an image of it and try to figure it out, because I am lost A F. Actually NVM I can't even find an image bigger than 100X64...... It's bad, lets just say that. On one half you have a drop down to select a source, on the other half you have your pockets, nearby wagons, wagon's you aren't even close to, other players / NPC peasants, the ground, an ALL page (???) and a cargo page. I have no clue what all or cargo are, but it didn't bring me anything. Also the menu's will decide to disappear and reappear at random. I know what you're thinking. ""Yeah you walked away from a chest or something right?"" No, that chest is still in the inventory available space and I am on the other side of the map, but my pockets are not there........ This is an easy fix so no big prob there, but the inventory system needs to be thrown out and redone, even with legos, I don't care how.Earlier I said the game was complex A F. This is no joke. You have to build your siege weapons by hand. You get to design how they balance, pull, push, counter balance, all of it. With the bugs in the physics engine you couldn't have a rotary balista without it helicoptering to space, but you could do it nonetheless. I never figured out crafting but I imagine that it is just as wierd. Even picking up basic resources is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Cut down a tree! And again! And Again! AGAIN! Try picking it up! Leave inv and try again! No? Well walk out of the map chunk and back and try again. There ya go!All in all this is an awesome game and anyone who picks it up will not be disappointed. If you're like me you jump in and immediately you think of a first person version of Banished. While it definately needs to have a lot of bugs exterminated and annihilated, pick it up, fund the devs, have a go with some friends, and I garuntee you that you will be laughing your♥♥♥♥♥off at some point.

								I do not like the idea of writing negative reviews on games. However, I cannot recommend this title in its present state. This one has been out for some time, and it is still very poorly allocated. The memory allocation makes the game almost impossible to run. I have a GTX970 video card, and a 4690 Intel processor, as well as 8G of ram. The game is not running worth a darn on it. It continually freezes up (usually after every single block placement while building), and then crashes to desktop, saying that there is sufficient memory for all the tasks running. The only things running is the Steam ap and the game. When the problem is posted on the discussion page, the devs do not respond. The only response I have seen is the statement that the individual's computer is not powerful enough to play the game. And this for a fairly high-end rig. The construction inventory, to be fair, is fairly extensive. However, it lacks some fairly vital and basic items. For instance, you can place statues around the castle courtyard, but there are no doors of any kind. No drawbridges, nothing. So either you cannot leave the keep, or the enemies can just walk in. I can see this oversight for a short while, but for any length of time it is pretty game breaking.As a multiplayer game it has some serious potential down the road, provided the devs actually (eventually) respond to, and address the issues in-game. But that time has not yet arrived. And as long as they ignore these legitimate concerns from their customers, the game is still fairly unplayable. As a single-player game, which the store page insists that it is, there is nothing to do but to build the architecture. No serious NPC's exist or are slated to ever exist as far as I can tell. That is not all bad. As a castle-building simulator, it could be fun for some people, and I would eventually be willing to recommend it at that time, provided the problems are addressed.			"

								Keen Software delivers yet again redefining how we think of Creativity Sandboxes and Voxel games, and taking all the wonderment of building in Space, and slapping it on the ground. Coupled with this is the introduction of structural integrity, the ability to have two blocks occupying the same space, and an absolutely smashing soundtrack, Medieval Engineers, though presently unpolished, is rapidly shaping up to be the kind of game that many will rapidly learn to enjoy in a big way!There's not much to do yet other than build, but every week, new content is coming out, and new tweaks to the engine to make everything work that much better!

								Note to everyone: Keys NEVER to forget: ""Z"" and ""CTRL"". (In this game, they will REALLY make your life easier). At release day this game is a sandbox, you can play with physics and create things with a (VERY!) limited set of tools... don't feel down with that, those tools can help you create great things... TERRIBLE things!!!... yes... but GREAT!.  (lol).  If you ever played Space Engineers, think of this as the creative mode, on a planet and with full gravity working. The only ""down"" side, is that objects seem to have no weight, you can kick around the whole map a part of a stone wall bigger than you. I guess the devs will work this out sometime. Recommended?, Obviously if you like creative ""do-it-for-yourself"" stuff... Because, if you don't like this style of games... why would you be here?. PS: Yes, I did what EVERYONE does, spend an hour building a ""sort-of"" castle, and 5 minutes destroying it.			"

They give us regular updates and actually tell us about each update and what it means for the game!  On top of that, developments from both Space Engineers and Medieval Engineers will affect each other with the various ""breakthroughs"" they have for each game.

								===EARLY ACCESS REVIEW===This review is from an EARLY ACCESS STATE and may not be valid in the future.I first purchased this game when it had just come out on Steam. It was wonderful at that point, had a lot of promise.Unfortunately, I couldn't run it very well on my dual-core with 4GB of RAM, and r9-270x.Fast forward to now - I run an i5, 12GB of RAM, and the same 270x, and the game runs massively worse.When I first ran this game at release, I ran it on max settings at ~45fps, now with my upgraded computer I'm lucky to pull off 20fps at LOWEST settings at the same resolution. There are massive bugs (Floating buildings, etc) that still exist that have existed since day 1, and in it's current unlplayable state I definitely cannot recommend this unoptimized, buggy game.Sure maybe if you have a 5930k, 16gb of RAM and a 980 ti you can get 50fps, but is that worth it to run this little thing?

								I haven't been playing this game for very long, but I definitely enjoy Medieval Engineers.I came to it via Space Engineers, so I often compare the two and follow the two together. I've followed the progress both for quite some time, and I don't understand why some people would call the folks developing the games ""stupid"". It's disrespectful and inaccurate.So, in an effort to balance out a few really bad, really not nice, reviews from some people whom I'm happy not to know, I'm submitting my own review.For the record, I know what ""Early Access"" means. I don't regret spending $20 bucks on the game. I'd do it again. It's relaxing. Well, until a tree falls on you.Could use improvement:The help / controls seem to be incomplete or inaccurate. For example, I couldn't find anywhere that holding F will pick up some objects. I knew it could be done; I just didn't see find a button to do it in the controls setup. I didn't hear anyone mention it in any videos either, though I didn't watch many of them.Barbarians are ninjas: silent one hit killers. They stink.The odd dancing/wobbling thing your character does when trying to walk over stuff. Hey, I get it. Physics. Maybe the camera could be smoothed out? The same thing is in Space Engineers. I feel like I'm doing a little dance while trying to get out of holes! Ole! Going into 3rd person camera helps.I know it's selfish, but I rely on ""community"" content a lot in games. I see the community stuff for this game out there, but it's not to the level that I was expecting. A specific example is just trying to see how to make the furnace work. How many sticks to I have to burn for something, etc. I guess it's easier to find out info for Space Engineers than Medieval Engineers. I realize one is older than the other.Real nice stuff:Building. Yes. You can build lots of real nice stuff.If you don't enjoy building, then this isn't the game for you.If you don't like putting things together with your imagination, then this game is not for you.If you must follow some other person's plot and story to enjoy your time, then this game is not the game for you.If you want a finished product, then this game is not the game for you!Some people have compared this game to Minecraft. I don't see the comparison. This game actually has the concept of physics. Or something. Let's just say things fall, and roll. There's a crafting table. I guess that's how people are making the Minecraft connection. Whatever.I see people complaining about various features that are in the game and features and aren't in the game. I guess they can't see the big picture. Maybe the devs would do good if they release some kind of feature roadmap. Maybe they have, and I haven't found it.It's a building game. You build. In fact, the devs are still building the game. They send out updates very frequently. I don't get the feeling this is another one of those dead projects that I shelled out money for and got burned, because it was abandoned. Everything says otherwise.			"

They also really ought to do the same for their other building game space engineers as the same problem is prevelant there.Do not buy this game if...Your computer has any processor less powerful than an intel I7.Your computer costs less than £400You own a mac.I hope you found this useful....

								The thing to remember about this game is that it is early access. And oh, how early access it truly is.In its current form (I write this in April 2015, just after the addition of deer AI), I would not reccomend getting this game. At all. There are just so many bugs, lag issues and imperfections. I have faith they will be fixed as the game development progresses, but right now, it's horrific. And one thing stands out above all else.The game lags, all the time. Every time anything is hit by a projectile, or otherwise damaged by other means, the game freezes. And I don't want to hear any crap from people saying it's about system requirements; I have every single aspect of the reccomended PC specifications fulfilled, and it still behaves this way. You would have to hack into the Pentagon and use their supercomputers to run this game for it to be smooth, and even then it'd probably freeze every now and then.Oh, and the loading times. Good lord. It can take up to 3 minutes to load a level. Again, i'm sure this will be abbreviated by various adjustments to the physics engine and whatnot, but good god. Lord have mercy on the person who tries to open the replica of AC2's Monteriggioni someone made.I feel this game has tremendous potential, and will mature into a good, entertaining experience given time, but in its current form, I do not reccomend you pay £15 to play the lagfest that is April 2015's Medieval Engineers.

								The Planets update is a HUGE step in the right direction! I just wish they'd bring back the ability to drag logs around and craft carts instead of the immersion-breaking inventory. Also, please for the love of god bring back the tree cutting feature in which you could cut down ANY tree to get logs - and then cutting the logs more if you wish to have timber/round timber. Looking for thicker trees is annoying, especially when they're only about 1% thicker than the new round-timber trees.Not sure why they opted for the new tree-cutting.Unfortunately I'm going to have to give this a negative. Please fix these issues, instead of following the same path of every other crafting game, make your own formula! The dragging logs and carts were unique and fun.			"

Early Access Review
								Medieval engineers is the second game in the engineers series by Keen Software House, after Space Engineers.This review will touch on several topics concerning this game.Table of contents:1. Developers2. Gameplay3. Look and feel4. Content5. Stability and bugs6. Conclusion (TL;DR version)1. DevelopersI think it's very important to address this first, since at the time of writing there's some serious accusations being thrown about. This game is NOT abandoned. The company, keen, consistently updates this game weekly, and since a total work ethic change a few months ago, became one of the most consistent, structured ones i've seen.Updates are weekly on a tuesday, alternating between content updates, like new things to build, and bugfixing/stabilizing/optimizing updates. Once every few months, a major update is released, like planet-sized maps or farming/ores. i can't say i've ever seem them miss an update by a lot, unless they had a very good reason for it.2. GameplayMedieval Engineers plays like a mix between a survival and sandbox game. While the survival part has been traditionally rather barebones, improving on this has been the team's focus for quite some time now. Farming and tech progression are just some of the things the team has added to make this a richer experience over the course of the last year.As for the sandbox part - Medieval engineers isn't story-bound and allows the player to create whatever they want - there's also a creative mode to omit the survival aspect entirely for those who purely want to focus on building magnificent structures from the get-go. Despite the presence of creative mode, survival isn't compromised, and everything you can build in creative can be built in survival.3. Look and feelMedieval engineers, just like space engineers, takes a mostly realisti approach in it's visual style. the game is quite detailed but as a result does put a bit more 4. ContentAt this point, medieval engineers has a pretty decent ammount of content. there are still things both major and minor that are desired to be added, but there's definetely enough for a base game. While vanilla itself already allows one to richly decorate buildings from the inside and outside, both in terms of furniture and architectural variation, the modding community definetely helps by adding things that are too specific in taste for the game to automatically have for everyone. That is of course, not to say the mods fill the holes that the game leaves unfilled, it just adds those niche things that are more of an expansion than part of what would make the game whole.5. Stability and bugsI am aware that this section can be rather personal, and that's exactly why i beg your consideration when taking this in account while rating the game. the thing about bugs is that they're not always consistent. I personally haven't encountered any bugs that made me frustrated while playing. (honestly, i can't say i've encountered one recently at all), but i know that other players have. However, it's safe to say that at the moment there's no game-breaking bugs that are widespread across larger part of the community, or if there are, they are usually fixed in one or two updates. the dev team has dedicated every odd update entirely to fixing bugs and stabilizing and optimizing the game.6. Conclusion (TL;DR version)In my experience, medieval engineers is on the right track. It still has a way to go to reach it's full potential, but is definetely showing both promise and the will to move forwards. the game is pretty solid at this point, and it doesn't seem like the dev team is stopping anytime soon, with terraforming being the next major update set to release soon. While it definetely made a very slow start, it's picked up speed since 2015. i have to admit that i entirely quit playing somewhere in 2015 because the game was progressing so slowly, but when i came back to it a couple of months ago, i saw that it had grown into something far greater than what it was then. i think that given time, this can be a really solid game, and it's already pretty neat to play.

								This game is a great sandbox about building giant towers and destroying your own creations! The AI is dumb, but still a great concept. There are  still many glitches, but the game suprisingly flows like butter! Sure, the lag kills me here and there, but you quickly forget about it! So far, this is the best Medieval simulator on the market.			"

								Medieval Engineers is a great game. You canbuild everything and you can play it with your friends. But it has its bad sides- No friends, no fun- Nothing to build of do if you play it for long-  Nobody in multiplayer (When i played)-  Needs a great PCAnd here are its good sides- Can build EVERYTHING- Gets updates every week- Great graphicsSo if you have friends, really want to build something of if you have a big imagination, buy this game!

								In my opinion this game is pretty amazing as it is. The game engine itself is built by keen software, which is a lot more than most indie companies even try to do. The engine itself is what takes the most time in almost any game’s development process. The only other indie company I know of that makes its own engine is tale worlds.  Look at games like Ark Survivor Evolved which rake in huge profits and then demand more money for additional content before the game is even finished and it’s ran off of an already built engine for game designing. This game is still being updated and produced without requests for additional funds and the content is great. Yeah, it takes time for them to make the updates but if you knew anything about game design you’d realize that content in a game this detailed is time and labor extensive. I’m an aspiring game designer myself so I’ve learned to appreciate just how much work goes into these games and the fact that this game has one of the best physics engines I’ve seen for a game and some of the nicest graphics for an indie game based on its own engine I’ve nothing to complain about. Yeah, it has bugs but so does every early access game in existence because guess what we’re paying to alpha test the game! It’s not like it’s a finished product slapped with a full price tag and told that it will work 100%. Triple A titles do this to us all the time and when it has bugs they patch them after release and you’ve already dropped 60-80 bucks on it! Just look at Rome 2 total war, Battlefield 4 and almost any other triple A company’s games when they come out fresh from the cooker. Keen, I don’t know if you read these but if you do thank you so much for being an honest and amazing company, Keep up this amazing work and I’ll continue to recommend this game along with space engineers  to everyone I know because it is a rare thing to see a company which has some real honor behind them.

I have been watching this game for a while and I know that there wont be any support for this for a long time. thanks developers for bringing a game worth $5, increasing the price to $20, and  cheating players out of their money.( im also mad at my brother's poor taste in good games) Believe the other reviews, they are accurate.

								     I have been playing this game since its release and I have really enjoyed the creative element of it.  I understand it is in ""Early Alpha"" therefore it still has its issues.  I have Space Engineers also and seeing how well that game has grown an advanced I would only expect this game to do also.  The level of game detail is great, the depth you have when building and creating machines is amazing.     If you enjoy Space Engineers / Minecraft style creative games then this is for you.  I think this game is just going to get bigger and better and may I dare to say might rival Minecraft if they push it in that direction.  Anyone sitting on the fence about this game should jump off and get it quick.     There are current system requirements to play the game that are quite high so please be sure to check it will run on your machine before you buy.  Also this is a ""Early Alpha"" game so be aware it has very minimal content other the creative mode but what is there is a lot to work with already.     So in closing I highly recommend this game, but do your homework about it before you make your final decision.			"

								When I first bought the game it seemed amazing. Building a castle then seeing the awesome destruction as it toppled. Building medieval weapons with outstanding physics was really fun. Fun for about an hour. After that the game gets extremely boring. There's just nothing else to do. No missions or objectives. Nobody is EVER on multiplayer. After a couple of months they released survival mode. It was so difficult to learn and ultimately just plain boring. I deffinetly regret buying this game and I wish I would have bout space engineers instead.

Early Access Review
								TL;DR at the bottom.Lets just start with this: The reason I haven't written this review yet was because I couldn't take my face out of the game itself.ALSO This game is early access (and I mean ""it got released today"" early) and if you do not know what that means, it means that it is in early development and will grow in the future.Aside from one sentence remarks, let's start with a basic summary. Most people probably know that Medieval Engineers is Keen Software House's second ""Engineers"" game (for those who don't know, Space Engineers is the first and I thought it was spectacular). This game has a whole new level of interesting and unique features, and both Space Engineers and Medieval Engineers are going to feed each other ideas. For example, ME had  ""Voxel hands"" first, then SE got them. So, back to this game and ONLY this game. This game has smooth gameplay, solid building, few bugs that I can see, and is very beautiful graphics wise. Two of the main features you come across very early in gameplay are the destruction physics and compound building. 1. Destruction physics: The detsruction of buildings reminds me a lot of ""Red Faction: Guerilla"" and it's GeoMod engine. When a catapult projectile is dropped on a building, it will crack and shoot dust up. When a catapult projectile is charged up and launched, it does major damage. When a full building block (or a whole building itself) is dropped on a building, it is just turned to rubble. The destruction is solid and satisfying to cause.2. Compound building: This is a feature I hope gets implimented into SE. I am positive it will. Here's what it does: Let's say the whole in-game building system is on a grid of 1x1x1 cubes (let's call it a unit). So 1 block of stone is a whole unit, 1 stairs block is 1 unit and so on. Well, If you have walls that are placed to the edge of the unit, then you could not place 2 walls to make a corner in a 1 block unit. With compund building, you can. So you can do it with almost any block.Now, PROS and CONS:Pros:1. Gameplay: Solid, smooth and fun. Pretty straight forward. 10/102. Graphics: The worlds are beautiful and very scenic. Even the buildings themselves and the medieval textures are very realistic and quite spot on. There is 1 bug where placing multiple blocks in 1 slot makes textures glitch in the spot that the material overlaps. But not too big of a deal. 9.8/103. Building: The building is solid and fun. Easy to do, but takes some getting used to. 9.8/104. Controls: There are alot of controls to learn and shortcuts to master, but it is not too hard to get a grip on. 9.5/105. Complexity/simplicity balance: One thing I look at in any building/crafting game is how simple it can be for simple people, while also being ABLE to be very complex for very creative people if they so choose. This game does it. You can simply build houses, or use medieval machinery to build crazy contraptions quickly and actually quite easliy, and of course there will updates and optimizations. 10/10Cons1. *YOU CAN IGNORE THIS ONE FOR NOW; VERY EARLY ACCESS GAME* Not very much content, so if that is what you are looking for, you should wait a few weeks, months maybe.2. Map size: As far as I can tell, the maps are not very large, and are not procedurally generated. HOWEVER this might (and probably will) change in the future. TL;DRVery good game with solid gameplay, beautiful graphics, a lot of controls but easy to use, and smooth overall. Not many cons other than the map size. Very early access so there isn't much content yet, however, I recommend this game for sure.I hope this review helped you make a decision. :)			"

Early Access Review
								Short review-amazing.  Well worth 20 bucks if you enjoy building castles.Long Review-ProsHard game to stop playing.  There is always one more build to attempt and one more looky-loo at your creation.  After spending 3-4 hours messing around, learing the controls, I have been putting together an imense mountain castle that includes a drawbridge, portculi, dozens of towers, houses, and catapults.  It is easy to get lost in your work while hours pass by.  The graphics are beautiful, and on my new Alienware, I see the grass and trees sway in the breeze.  I get the same feeling playing this game that I got as a kid playing with legos nonstop, oblivious to the world.But, there are a few problems that can be frustrating.It's Alpha.  There is clunkiness to the controls, especially in clearing debris.  As others have mentioned, the buildings you constuct need to be over-engineered or they will tumble down.  There is a lack of variety of materials to flesh out your castle: a bed, table, dresser, and a chair is all you get for now.  Roofs can be very anoying to place correctly and if you misplace, you often delete the walls underneath in addition to the section of roof.   You also have only a half a dozen maps to choose from, none of which are overly large.  There is no water as of yet, so no moats.  Smoothing terrain is perhaps the most frustrating part of the game for me so far.  Instead of pushing down on terrain, you add up.  The controls are clunky, awkward, and no way to take away or delete terrain.  No food, crops, animals, resources, blacksmithing, or fine crafting of any type.  Flying can test your nerves as well.  Gravity doesn't exist if flying mode, so inertia sends you at mach 1 with just a touch of the controls.  You often need to be in the perfect spot to place a block, and the inertia controls require fine little pushes in the direction you want to travel in.  Plus, you are invulnerable and if you send yourself flying into a wall, if often comes tumbling down as cuss words tumble out of your mouth.You can't name saved games, which can be anoying and load times can be long.  Finally, my last gripe is copying and pasting.  Currently, you copy everything already created.  So, let's say your castle is rocking, but you want to add some catapults.  You are forced to save, restart a new game, create your catapult, copy, exit game, and finally go back to your saved castle to plop and paste the weapons.  But, and I can't stress this enough, the game is very adicting.  For an Alpha, it's more than playable and it should only get better with more features being brought in.  Multiplayer could be a blast, as long as they toughen up the integrity of your creations or battles could be very very quick.  Overall, two fat thumbs up!			"

								This is the only time I've been burned by an Early Access title.Plain and simple: It's boring. There is no gameplay. I don't mind sandboxes at all, and I play ME's sister game (Space Engineers) religiously. But this one is totally uninspired, bland and its only purpose is shooting at stuff with catapults. Yes, it is Early Access and things may change. But at this point I don't think it will unless they radically change their approach to game design.Edit: This was written before the ""Planets update"" was released, but my point still stands. I don't feel as the gameplay has changed much.			"

								The game is fun and highly functioning, but there are certain aspects of the mechanics in the game which I would really like to see be changed. At the time of this review the follow mechanical problems exist:When trying to build a circular tower, you cannot build a staircase within it because the staircase... touches...?... the walls. You cannot build things directly on top of wooden platforms, instead the object you place on the wooden platform is elevated a few centimeters above it. I have only briefly played this game and therefore these are the only things that have disrupted my game play. So far I have yet to see a bug, although controlling the character both in first person, third person and free mode is rather awkward. The graphics are very nice, it runs smoothly but I would like to see the loading time decreased significantally. I just recently read some of the negative reviews and I have to say, PLEASE remember that this is an ALPHA GAME. There isn't a lot of content, the game is sometimes buggy and will run relatively bad on some computers. If you don't like these things, wait untill it is finished.			"

								Can't even be labeled as a game. Destructions cool, building is one of the most frustrating things, the snap on building is the absolute worst, causing you to accidently delete important parts of buildings causing a good 10 minutes of work to crumble down before you its cool to watch but can really be frustrating. Structural integrity is definitly not like in the videos. I've started worlds with structural integrity on, taking out a whole bottom floor with one column in a corner holding up a 3 story building... Suggest waiting a bit before buying. still great for early access though.			"

								After playing quite a bit of Space Engineers i was thrilled when the developers announced they would be making a Medieval Engineers. I preordered space engineers when it was in alpha(taking that risk of whether or not it will be worth it down the road) and after watching it grow and evolve was amazing. I have no doubt in my mind this game wont succeed if the devs put the same amount of work and effort into both listening to the fanbase and keeping new content flowing as they did with Space Engineers.Now they are missing alot at the moment from resource gathering to even rope tention so my monstrousity of a trebuche can't actually fire the ball. None the less i have no doubt that both of these along with multiplayer will be coming soon due to my past experience with these devs. Never had any issues with major bugs in their games and they've earned my trust for sure.So im very excited to see more content be released to build onto what theyve already started. From the amazing and im sure painfully to cod rock deteriation/destruction to the well built physics engines within the game i fully reccommend this game. Its in alpha but it has alot of potential and i believe the Dev team will have no trouble turning the game into something worth more then 20$			"

								Keen actually is starting development on here back up, but I will admit that it was slow. The game is an overall great idea, but you need to have a creative mindset. Some people who have 1.3 hours will say that this game sucks, but you actually need to know how to place a piece of wood down. It has a few glitches, but I feel that they will be worked out in the near future.ME is an overall fascinating idea, but to get the most out of this game, you'll need to be creative. You can make tons of weapons, not just catapults and trebuchets, but your own custom ones. People have made giant trebuchets that launch houses. Now that's creativity.			"

YouTube™ Video: Early Access Monitor - Is Medieval Engineers worth it? - Early Access Review 

			Views: 1,113		

			Welcome to Early Access Monitor series. Today we are going to find out Why Is Medieval Engineers Getting more Negative Reviews On Steam.		

Game has been out for just over 2 years with first public build coming out on 19 of February 2015. And until now around 270,000 people bought the game with majority of the purchases happening in initial months. Currently there is about 7750 active players of the game and that number had risen from 4000 in September so we are seeing a bit of positive trend over last few months. Last but not least the game review scored has dropped dramatically from it’s original reception. As always it is essential that people who buy early access understand that they buying an experience rather than fully developed product. It is implied that product will improve over the years but you must understand that the product may evolve in a ways you may dislike. Okay with all the facts and this little introduction  in mind let’s look at a potential reasons in review drop and what that means to you potential customer. First the description of a game reads as: Medieval Engineers is a sandbox game about engineering, construction and the maintenance of architectural works and mechanical equipment using medieval technology. Players build castles; construct mechanical devices and underground mining. There is an entire planet to explore!What a time to be alive! I have always been impressed by the technological miracles engineers achieved with simple technology like rotors, ropes and powers of nature. We can easily imagine that people who bought into the product are modded minecraft veterans, Nerds and Nerdettes that enjoy tweaking their build, constructing impossible machines with clever use of simple technology. Modern day wannabe engineers who like a challenge that medieval times bring. Here however lies the problem with the game. For first year and a bit game lacked a lot of direction developers were jumping from one update to the other with what felt like absolute lack of road map. Game started to drift away from it’s original purpose of engineering and machine building and more towards building design and multiplayer. After a while they started adding survival element. Of course survival elements and multiplayer are essential to keep game like this alive and challenging but slowly very focused goal of making engineering game shifted into making more general survival experience. This left many people disappointed as it wasn’t initial promise of the game. I think this lack of direction was a major factor in increasing disappointment and slow death of playerbase. Medieval Engineer subreddit has stagnated in subscriptions as you can see in here: http://redditmetrics.com/r/MedievalEngineers and now look at what happen in other early access games with more focused development like Software Inc http://redditmetrics.com/r/SoftwareInc for example or Kerbal Space Program http://redditmetrics.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram back when game was in early access or even Space Engineers http://redditmetrics.com/r/spaceengineers older sister game of Medieval Engineers. As you can see game struggles to attract new fansI think major contributor to the state of a game is that team set themselves for a failure with weekly update schedule. Sometimes in game development you just have sit down and fix bunch of bugs, or code a major piece of work that will take small team few weeks to do. When you are pressured to release something new every week you end up focusing on minor additions rather than major patches. Even one of most recent updates is a door noise improvement. Is it nice that they tweaked it to be more natural? Sure. Is it important at this stage of development? Not so much. Okay let’s now focus on positives since October time when Planet updates was released development feels much more focused and it gives out the impression that someone took a dev team together sat them down and decided on a game vision and has more consistent plan in achieving it. Still weekly updates disturb the flow hence door noise update etc. but it’s much better that it was prior to that. With the new focus we have seen increase in active players bringing back some of the old veterans of the game. I am hoping that this focused direction will be consistent and will reignite the spark in the community and brings back more players, modders and content creators. From my brief chat with veterans of the game people who endured creation process of last 2 years it feel s it has been worthwhile experience and they feel game progressed Okay so what is Medieval engineers really. It is Medieval survival game with focus on multiplayer and base building with some focus on machine building. If you want the game in a spirit of Life is Feudal you will have fun with Medieval Engineers. If you want a game about building new machines and engineering it gives you some aspects of it but not enough to buy on the merit of this alone. Overall Medieval Engineers development is better than some of Early Access projects I have seen but game evolved a lot from it’s original form. Approach with caution or simply wait another year. As always with Early Access don’t buy the game on hopes on potential but it only if you like it in current format. Nerds and Nerdettes my name is Feniks and I hope you had a great time watching today's Early Access Monitor and you are able to make better informed decision about the game. I am looking forward to your opinions in the comment section down below and hope for some good discussion. Have a nice day.			"

Early Access Review
								I have played a couple of hours of the game, BUT! The game right now is small, so I can allready take a solid review.When I firstly launched the world, I felt like I have just appeared in the Medieval Era. The nicest medieval music and nice grassy plain met me with happiness and temptation. Then, turning left 135 degrees, I saw a house. I walked to it and sat inside, feeling really cozy. Although, then I saw big projectile in my belt. Of course, it is really obvious what to do. I saw how to control those in a really friendly presented tutorial. So, I walked out from that cozy 15th century house and picked up my projectile and BOOOM. The house is to the ground. Great havoc-ish damage physics - KSH always deals with those damage physics, in all their recent games.     Okay, I wanted to build a castle like this Neuschwanstein one. I found a mountain, terraformed a bit of ground for the keep and started building. I made a nice guard tower, which fromed so SOFTLY and INTUITIVE, which I can't say for some games, even, sometimes, Space Engineers. I copied the tower, although, it took me a big bite of my time to mess around with copying and pasting it. I couldn't rotate it. Although, I am going to close my eyes on ot - it's a magnificent alpha.So, I saw another problem - maybe I am doing something wrong, or don't know how to do it. But I built my towers sideways to the ""voxel grid"". I would need to build my walls the wacked way. *Sadface:(*So, let's see, what is positive, and negative about this game.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++1. Nice, Fluid and intuitive building system.2. Nice graphics. Not the best, but they are good for the game of this type.3. MAGNIFICENT damage physics, and structual integrity.4. Mechanical elements. And weapons, that you build yourself, which means, that if you are in multiplayer, better you build your Trebushetes ( or smth. ), the better you will siege.-----------------------------------------------------------------1. Sometimes crashes. You can drop this off, because it's an early acces game.2. Hard terradorming. You need to get your hands dirty and whack for a little bit, before building.3. Sometimes, whacky movement/dissy camera. Well, that is the problem of all the games from KSH.Just deal with it.Although, I give this game a good 8,5/10. It's a great game with big potential.			"

Early Access Review
								Its minecraft for adults. Sort of. It plays alot like space engineers, which is a good thing, but it it has the creative factor that minecraft used to have. Its incomplete, its got some bugs, especially in block rotation and placement. You also cant delete debris yet, but there are ways around this. And structural integrity is a great feature, If you build like you might, in say minecraft or even space engineers, the game will punish you. you have to think ahead, what's going to need support, will x block be strong enough, etc. Its like playing with your cat, one moment everything is great, all is well, but then you do just the wrong thing and your getting bitten or clawed. but you don't mind, you keep on playing, because just like your cat, Medieval Engineers is just too lovable to stop playing, even if it does leave you cut and bleeding.As far as debris is concerned there are two ways of dealing with it. One is to wait for them to delete themselves after a few minutes, but this wont get rid of blocks still intact enough to count are a full block but have come loose. Alternatly you can start a game, then save and go back to the main menu, go to load the save, but instead of loading your save go to edit settings and set the debris limit to 0. Blocks will still break and loose blocks will still fall, and poorly built structures will still colapse. But, there will be no anoying little debris that you can't delete with a right click. Beyond that, everything else is straight forward.Buy it now while its on beta discount, you wont regret it.			"

RedemptionWith the release of 0.3.1 (October 18th) I feel that I must change my review as the dev team from KSH has redeemed themselves a lot with this most recent release. They have not only introduced a world, with fast travel capabilities, but they have finally fixed many annoying issues from the past. (targeting issues, motion sickness / FOV issues, etc) Is the game perfect? Not yet. Is the game completely free of bugs or issues? I don't know, it's still a game in early access so I'm sure there will be glitches and bugs along the way. But the game breaking issues seem to be resolved at this point and the dev team appears to be back on track. Let's hope the trend continues! I still have high hopes for this title. At this time I'm going to give this a thumbs up, for now! Good job!			"

								This game started off rough but has come a long way. Its a fun castle builder with farming and improved crafting (You can now mine iron and have to unlock skill sets with resources to progress, so you work to accomplish something!) The game is much more intuitive and enjoyable to play with all the new features and bug fixes as of late. I would say this game is worth the sale price as of this writing to get. Its a fun medieval survival builder game and has great potential which is being improved on by the team with regular vital updates and continuos contact with the community and involvement with its player base.

								Alright, have you ever played Red Faction: Guerilla? Have you ever watched those buildings crumble in Lord of the Rings? If either of those things intrigue you, then pick up Medieval Engineers. This game is in early access, and is a bit buggy, but I assure you that this Dev team is far better than any other Indie team I've ever followed in an early access environment. Space Engineers (Another KSW game) gets weekly updates on the dot, and they never fail to disappoint. They actually listen to their community (I'm talking: ""We reaaaally want this."" ""You want that, okay hang on... There you go."" Kinda listen). Support this Indie dev team and get this game if you want Voxel based building w/ Red Faction destruction.			"

								I spent a few hours building a castle.  After I was done and spent 50+ hours on it, I looked around and realized I had just been conned.  There is nothing to do, even the NPC AI is a joke, in fact 7D2D has a better AI and this is supposed to be from the company that is supposedly ""rivaling Google's AI technology"" lol... No.If you are new to Keen or somewhat new, go look up Miner Wars.  You'll find a trend the same thing CodeHatch has done:1. Create awesome concept 12. Collect millions from concept 13. Create awesome concept 24. Close down and abandon concept 1 before completion5. Collect millions from concept 26. Create awesome concept 37. Close down and abandon concept 2 before completionYou get the idea.MinerWars was concept 1.  Space Engineers is concept 2, who do you think concept 3 is and what do you think is going to happen?			"

								I have to say when this first came out it was a mess. Than they did a big planet update (the world is round not flat)  and now I been playing this game and having fun on servers. It takes a little to get use to, its best to join someones game and join a faction to learn the ropes. I hope they keep working on both games but it seems that this is more stable than Space Engineers. Still a few bugs and lag online but I think a few patches can fix it. I think the community is growing again. I hope more interesting mods and blueprints will appear. Overall this game huge improvement update made me come back and now I enjoy the game.			"

								I bought this game and been playing it before it was released on Steam.First and foremost, thanks Keen SWH to creating a such a nice game.It has few features because it's an early-access game however even the tools have been given to you is more than enough to show your creativity.If you played Space Engineers before and liked it, you won't  be disapponted if you ever buy this game.Catapults, bridges, terraforming, voxel, structural integrity.These features are yours to use, in time i'm sure they will add more and more feature to this game.If you wanted to build castles, bridges and be the part of medieval history, this game is for you !

								Medieval Engineers is in its early stages as I write this review.Have you ever played block building games and felt the need to place foundations and build buttress, even though the game physics don't require it? Ever looked at a floating building with despair?Then THIS is the game for you. Composite building and structural integrity mean you can build a realistic building where the design matters far more than in any other game of this kind.I have clocked quite a few hours on this so far, and I can see myself whiling away a good chunk of my spare time here. I love the way you can build structures from deep basements to towering watchtowers that will collapse if I do it wrong!Don't get me wrong, the physics aren't too punishing. You won't have your buildings falling apart every five minutes. It's just a relief to build structural supports where they actually have an effect.The potential of this game has only just begun to be realized. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys building. Also, to anyone who loves to destroy and test the strength of a tower.[Addition] After a couple of months, I do find a degree of frustration with this game. Lag and frame drop are a very real issue everytime you know down a building. As I see much of the fun of this game in the destruction of what I build, this has become a real disappointment. I also love the idea of playing multiplayer, and running through a building my friend is destroying. Again though, lag is intense when destroying things, making this an almost unplayable feature.It is my hope that this game will improve, but it might be worth waiting a while.			"

								Another great title from Keen Software House! I have been following development for this game since it was announced and even got in on the early-early-access. Structural integrity is one of the key elements for this game. You need to be mindful of how you build your castles so that the weight is evenly distributed and your structure will not collapse. This is one of the best looking early-access games that I have played! It shows a lot of promise and the developer has been absolutely fantastic with releasing updates for Space Eningeers so I would expect to see the same for Medieval Engineers. Can't wait to see how this game shapes up in the future!			"

								If you like building castles and basic siege weapons, this is your game! The physics engine has a lot of promise by letting you destroy your castle with a great sense of realism (if your PC can handle it!). It may be early access however Keen Software House has proven to be very responsive, trustworthy and hardworking. They have updated Space Engineers every week without fail for over a year.TLDR:Great castle builder with physics, needs decent pc, reliable game devs.			"

								I am a huge fan of Keen House Software.  Space Engineers is pretty epic and things you can do is limitless.   Now the did Medieval Engineer.  Right now it in open beta but just like Space Engineers the devs listen to suggestions and work really close with the mod comunity.  Now this game is raw so expect bugs durning the open beta but like space engineers the devs will do weekly update and the game will get better each time.  So far I was building a castle fairly quickly and it look pretty dope.   So yes get it now why it 19 buck and in open beta.  When the fine tune this bad boy expect the price to rise when they fully release it.			"

								I realy like this game so far, it just came out yesterday and I think it's impressive for such an early alpha-build.The great feature of a physic that punishes bad engineering makes the game in my opinion a one of a kind medieval sandboxgame. Sometimes there are of cours some paricals that act like they are under some magical influence but it's not like it would even have an effect on the fun destroing your castle ^^What I would like to see in futur updates, are some more furniture and more detailed maps.Also water, but I think they're allredy working on it.

								As of now the game is boring. I have attempted to claim a refund for over a year but steam won't let me get rid of it, so over time I have come back to it hoping I did not waste £15 on it. Turns out nothing has really changed, the game itself is nothing compared to Space Engineers and I feel that they only developed this games to test future aspects for Space Engineers. Don't get me wrong I like Space Engineers and Planets being one of the most game changing updates and I love it. But this just makes me sick. Survival is unplayable and creative is boring. Multiplayer just gets repetitive and also boring. I do not recommend buying this game in its current state, but there still could be something to come in the future. Well at least I hope there will be.			"

								There has not been a substantial update in forever.  It feels like this game is in developement limbo, and with the lack of direction or anything that seems like an intended goal, I can't recommend this game.  It seemed very promising and fun at first, but given the fact that I bought it based off the potential of it---and how well they were doing with Space Engineers... I feel very burned by this game.  It seems like their ""Update Tuesdays"" are a joke compared to the leaps Space Engineers used to take.  Want the same boring blocks over and over again?  How about in three colors!  Wood, stone, and white?  This game is for you!  Want awesome destructability, but to feel limited by the plain and bland looking materials you are given?  Then definately buy it!  Want to be frustrated when every ""update"" they have is some BS mechanic that's just a re-tooling of what they've already done in the first place?  By all means pick it up.Otherwise, don't waste your time.  Hopefully that will get them to put some drive and be more ambitious with this game... because right now it feels abandoned.			"

								Keen Software House has to be one of the only early-access developers I trust. They are always pumping out updates weekly and if not you can expect a larger one the following week.Not only that but with Space Engineers they have released plenty of updates to the point I would call it a full game, yet they keep the updates coming for the costumers looking for more. They listen to what the people want.Medieval Engineers is a great game from what Iv'e experienced, understand it is Alpha and they are still working on a lot. They are looking for feedback so they can make the future product better. This game has great destruction and mechanics. I have had loads of fun with the small amount of items they have at the moment and they plan on adding a ton more.			"

The destuction is similar to red faction, which have been the leader of destruction games for alot of years (considerd by many). But in red faction you can't build your own structures which makes Medieval Engineers destruction 100 times better.			"

								Very cool building sandbox, with some very amazing features. -Currently has a few problems. -However these can be overlooked by simply saying that it just came out and is in alpha 1. -Terraforming is one of the craziest systems I've ever seen in video games -The voxal system is very creative and you can create caves with it too, no 90 degree slope limitations and such. -Many ground textures to use. -Building allows you to place objects inside eachother and has virtually no drawbacks other than a slightly confusing learning curve.-Structural integrity system that you can analyze [N reveals a graphical display debug for structura integrity]-Many blocks have veriants to choose from to allow more creative ability [Scroll Wheel will reveal veriations in things like roof blocks]-On another note, this game also has the abillity for mechanics and machines to be incorperated into you're structures.-Graphics are above par --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall worth you're $21.99 [CND] if you like sandbox, and creative building games.Additional Information: The game likes to crash on me a lot, so I have to save when doing anything that involes lots of work, looking into updating graphics drivers, planning to recheck after.

Early Access Review
								Keen Software House has come crashing down to Earth, it seems. Hot off the heels of their success with Space Engineers, the studio has taken a decidedly different approach to its next game. Yes, they’ve swapped the dark, lonely nothingness of outer space for the green and pleasant fields on Terra Firma. And whilst the core gameplay of Medieval Engineers is, in essence, no different from Space Engineers – build stuff, destroy stuff – it goes that extra mile to engross you in its twee setting. Medieval Engineers, like Space Engineers before it, launched as an Early Access title with a solid amount of content, and whilst its current incarnation only lets you build stuff just to knock it down, it gives an exciting glimpse at the possible shape the game might take in the future.Before you can indulge in senseless destruction you’ve got to build something first and, even at this early stage, the creation tools on offer are surprisingly slick. You can choose from a different number of fields to start out in, be it a rocky hill terrain, or a plain with a castle town already in it. Building your own castles using the various building blocks available to you is a cinch, and the auto-snap grid means that you will line everything up correctly – almost every time! I say “almost” because, at present it can be a real pain the undersatchel to line up floor panels. That’s before I have even touched on the terraforming tools.So, you’ve started building that ridiculously oversized mountain fortress and want to even out the ground a little, well it isn’t  going to be that easy. Terraforming, in theory, should be easy: you pick your brush shape, give it a width, height and depth, and can set about adding or subtracting ground blocks to the scene. There’s a bit of an art to it though, meaning you need a steady hand to keep things smooth – otherwise you end up with ground that has the texture of artex. Indeed, my inability to use the tool effectively saw me creating underground caverns that had an eerily beautiful quality to them, but I couldn’t get out! Hopefully, future releases will see these tools tweaked a bit for people like myself (idiots, basically).You needn’t build alone, either! Get a buddy or two in on the action and you’ll be up and running with a serviceable castle in no time; the system really is just that astonishingly easy to use. Think of it like minecraft where each block looks different and has different properties – except they aren’t cubes, of course. There are all sorts of different blocks at your disposal, from round-edged  walls for turrets, battlement attachments, and windmill blades for the show-offs.Humans will be human and it’s in our nature to tear down and destroy, and Medieval Engineers has you well covered in that department. Technical dunces like myself can equip small and large cannonballs to their hotbar and let rip a volley of shots on their structures, watching them crumble to the ground in a cloud of smoke and dust. There’s a perverse pleasure to be had in seeing your time-consuming efforts reduced to nought but rubble within a few minutes,  a feeling which is amplified by the warming celtic soundtrack that plays throughout. It’s a highly incongruous matchup, but also very enjoyable. You can further amplify the destruction by kicking your map’s maximum fracture pieces all the way to the top – your PC won’t thank you for it, but it sure as hell looks amazing! If you have the technical cojones to create catapults, trebuchets and other machines of war you can also set your mind free to think up the most dastardly creations it can. When you are done you can upload them to the Steam Workshop for others to enjoy – a feature that will no doubt become inundated with cool items I only wish I had the skills to create.There is so much untapped potential waiting to come out of Medieval Engineers that it’s difficult to see what form the final game will take. Keen have recently released an update featuring barbarians so who knows, maybe we will see a full-on medieval war simulator, with massive castle-vs-castle battles? I’ll see you all there when I manage to get out of this damn hole!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclosure: Preview key provided by Keen.

Early Access Review
								Yes, I would recomment this game myself. You have to realize though:1) This is still an Early Access game. Some of the features you EXPECT in this game, may not be applied yet.2) It came out not too long ago. You have to give it time before you negatively affect the reviews. As of now, There isnt much to do, but master the games mechanics and learn how to build. You can destroy things, and as of yesterday i believe, You are able to spawn barbarians to do the destroying for you.I wouldn't recommend this game if it wasnt for one slight detail.The developers are active. They are informing the community and are searching for ways to improve the game. Great people, and i do not believe they would abandon a game that was already advanced into early access. Especially since they can see the potential. We all have seen games where the devs havent notified the community in months. No updates in a year or so, and all the updates they do are just average bug fixes. I can tell you from my time playing Space Engineers (SE) That this is not the case.Note: Please also take into account that they are still working forward in SE. They applied workshop for us to keep ourselves entertained so they can have time to get what they need done, done. It's not a fast process.I will keep updating this as time moves along, as of right now the question is simple:Do you want to be part of a growing, excited community and support the devs?*UPDATE* 3/10/2015Finally added some new things! They now added barbarians, a survival setting where barbarians will attack your king statue every certain amount of minutes! Im really excited about this update. however, there are still many glitches. Like turning into jesus after throwing a cannonball. Freeze Framing in midair. Along with, barbarians attacking eachother instead of the statue, Barbarians throwing cannon balls BACK AT YOU (kobe), and The whole building youre in collapsing from one hit. lol. The glitches so far are very amusing. That is why i still suggest this game. I will keep updates as the game goes on.*UPDATE*  3/25/2015They finally!! Added!!! Ragdolls!!! You now have a day and night cycle. Which makes the survival more a bit more interesting. Along with that you know have pick axes, and other hand tools such as the torch and mace for defense. I have yet to try the full experience for the survival mode, for ive been very busy, as soon as i do i will update again. I'm hoping they added material requirments in survival mode to build with. Either way this game keeps getting better and better. The developers are cracking down hard on this game. However the only MAJOR con that i can see in this game so far, (well besides the things they havent added yet) Is the ability to spawn bots. Yes, this is an early access game and they probably dont have the patches to support alot of bots walking around the world at this time but i feel if you want to crash your game? crash it. lol. Right now you are only able to spawn 4 to 5 barbarians and and 3 peasants. Peasants will stockpile your ammo crates. Where they stockpile them at though is not under your control at this time. Example:I buillt a Practical castle. 4 walls. Each corner had a rotating catauplt on it. Outside I build a couple houses for scenery. Inside the castle were:BarracksA main hallMess hallCourtyardStatueGardenand War room. along with an extra hidden passage out. (i havent yet mastered the art of digging underground so it was just a doorway hidden by bushes and trees. I was launching my catapults for fun, and decided to test out the peasants. I noticed he took the ammo off of my catapult head every time i spawned one before i could launch it. This took my interest. I followed this young fellow of which i named jerry. I followed him far and wide. Out of the reaches of my castle. Through the hidden passage. Far into the reaches of the forests. Passed the hills. The he stopped. only for a second. Dropped the rock. Turned around and ran back to the castle. -_- I stayed put trying to figure out why he dropped the rock there. I waited. He came back with another rock. Dropped it in the same place. To speed things up, i spawned in 2 more peasants. To which they continued to fight over where the rocks would be placed. one would pick it up. walk over five feet and drop it. to which the other would pick it up and run another five feet and drop it. This continued until the other one came back with YET ANOTHER rock.... At which time they killed eachother by picking it up (and i guess glitching) And causing two of them to ragdoll. Other than that, yes i recommend this game. The devs are hammering down to add new parts. In the end it will truly be an amazing game.			"

								Very cool, but a long way to go. The multiplayer is currently a little dead, and servers struggle with too many players, but if you are planning singleplayer creative, the game is very fun. Once it is finished, I am sure we will have awesome multiplayer survival.Now I just need to get past a few crashes (devs are helping), and then I'll be able to make something awesome.			"

								At the moment I have not played much of it, but I am already in love with it. I purchased the first game, ""Space Engineers"", and can tell you that even though this may not seem like a good investment at the moment, it will be. The devs. keep updating Space Engineers, and will most likely keep this game updated as well. I wanted Space Engineers because I liked the idea of an open sandbox build game in space, but now that they have a Medieval Engineers, I knew I had to have it. This is game is going to go great places guys, all it needs is your help by buying it, and reporting all different bugs and things to help them improve it! So far nothing has proven to be a bug or glitch in my world, but I'm just getting started!			"

								New life has been breathed into this game! I played it a little bit before the new director (Tim) joined the team. Over the past 5 months there has been a hiatus on updates so the team could do a complete ground-up rewrite. The new version with planets and land claims adds much more focus to team play and pvp. Where before the game was a basic sandbox with no real goal, now Houses can make alliances or got to war. Areas can be claimed by players and shared with other players in their House.The game still has a long way to go. Many features have rough edges that need to be refined. There are some mechanical blocks that still need to be added to the game. The dev team does a great job of informing players of updates and changes in the weekly update videos every Tuesday. If anything goes wrong in an update you can be sure the dev team will roll out a hotfix to solve the issue.I've observed some very promising behaviour on the multiplayer servers. Complete strangers will play together and work to accomplish a goal, like building a watchtower to guard a village, or constructing a wall around their area. However, as with all sandbox games there is the problem of griefing. Players will join random servers just to wreck stuff and see things break. The developers have said they are looking at way to add offline protection. It is good to know they are aware of the problem and are already working on solutions.Unlike Space Engineers, another Keen Software House game, there is a suprising lack of ""Clang"" (weird physics bugs and breakages). You can build contraptions out of rope drums, catch blocks, and other mechanical blocks. Even on multiplayer servers it's no problem to have functioning siege engines rolling around the world and launching projectiles. There is sometimes a noticable drop in sim-speed, especially when a wall or tower is collapsing, but optimizations in future updates will alleviate that.If you enjoy multiplayer sandbox games I would highly recommend Medieval Engineers. Find a group of friendly players and make a House on an active server and you will have hours of fun ahead of you.			"

								Midieval Engineers is made by the same company as space engineers and in a lot of ways is strikingly similar. There are a number of differences though. The primary difference appart from setting, is the survival mechanics. While playing the survival mode of this game you do not start with the full knowledge of the different crafting materials or building materials. Instead you must research the different technology teirs to progress farther. In my opinion this mechanic is something that propells the game forward and prevents it from stagnating and resulting in a fatigueing issue that i so often have in space engineers.Another key difference is the introduction of structual integrity. This prevents you from building structures that have no means of supporting themselves. This makes the game feel not only more realistic, but also more flushed out as far as physics go.Pros--Fun sandbox experience-Lots of exploration-Regular updates and development schedule (Every Tuesday)-Stunning graphics and beautiful scenery-Many more building features than that of space engineers-Better keybinds than space engineersCons--Requires a decent ammount of power to run reliably-Still many bugs due to the alpha build status (NOTE: I do not hold anything against the title for the alpha build status and while i am aware that the number of issues in the game i currently have are directly related to the development cycle of the game and its alpha status, i do believe in reporting on anything and everything that would change or otherwise impact the experience of the player)-The UI is clunky and awkward to use-The UI is not very intuitive (Devs have stated UI changes are on the way)-Character controls feel stiff			"

Early Access Review
								Long story short, wait until this game is fully released or at least into a beta before buying it. It was a fantastic game when it first came out but the amount of bugs it currently has will make you regret spending the money. I'll preface this by saying that I was super excited to get this game when it first became available. As soon as I could I was playing it and I was amazed how well it worked for an alpha. At first there were very minor issues and bugs but overall the game was very playable, it was just a little lacking in features.Then they started to pander to the people demanding a survival mode and multiplayer (before the underlying systems were fully there). The result? More bugs than you'd find in a hoarder's house.Now I keep having the game just display blinding white, blocks that refuse to fit together like they had before, and control issues. It seems every update they add just makes things worse. Hell, most updates seem to be them trying to make multiplayer function more than trying to get the base game working.Call me crazy but multiplayer needs to be dealt with after the basic functions are all there. Otherwise you have a completely unplayable game rather than just a limited one.The problems Keen had with Space Engineers got resolved and I have no worries that Medieval Engineers will end up working. At the moment though, they are trying to do too much so you need to wait until the game can be finished so save yourself the headaches of wanting to play the game, but quitting because of the bugs. I used to spend hours building cities and castles, now I avoid the game. I come back to it every once in a while but right now, it’s best to just not play it.The videos you see were how the game played on original release. Literally, what you see in the videos they show you was how the game looked and worked in April 2015. If you want to see how Medieval Engineers works now, open word, zoom in 250% and stare at the white screen. That’ll be the current medieval engineers status and playability. If you read this, buy the game, then leave a bad review because of bugs, just know satan has a very special place for your kind. Overall, buy this game when it is fully released.			"

								Keep in mind that like all early access games, it takes a LONG time for the game to develop. In other words there isn't much of a goal right now. It's solely a sandbox. That isn't a bad thing by any means because the game is beautiful, has a realy cool sound track and the physics are phenominal. It's taken them roughly a year to get to this point and it will probably take a couple more years before the game really starts to come alive. But right now the game is still pretty damn cool. If you like to spend countless hours building a kick♥♥♥♥♥castle only to demolish it with your own armada of catapults then this is the game for you. Of course with enough patience you could make underground castles too.			"

								After many hours of building enjoyment, my game is broken :(  I uploaded screen shots of some of the builds, just because I had so much time/effort invested and I hated to lose them.  Maybe the save file is too big for its britches, but let's face it, this game takes too much juice to run properly.  I know, early access woes!  I'll shelve the game for now but I REALLY hope Keen Software House works out the inefficient run issues.  I hope to come back later and play a really great game.  All the potential is there.  All that said, I highly recommend this game.			"

								Development hasn't stopped for this game. Please consult the keen software house forums for varification. Also refer the the development diaries on the changelog for this game. As it stands now, if you are looking for a complete game, this isnt it. If you are looking for a survival game, this isn't it. If you are looking for something that requires engineering..this is it. Watch some videos, read more reviews, just please be cautious of negative reviews. Lot's of people are negative these days without doing proper research before purchasing. Don't be that man or woman. With early access, you get to buy an unfinished, unpolished game that has a good bit to offer. You get to see the deveopment of a budding game to it's end. If you like building and destroying castles or houses, this has a great destruction mechanic along with a nice structural integrity system. The game promises fast travel, enemy AI barbarians, Farming, water, more intutive mechanics, and a unique combination type building mechanic that allows for some very interesting construction techniques. I reccommend this game to any person who is patient and interested in crafting games. As it stands, you could probably have a good 30 hours of fun at the least just building and destroying things. Please for the love of all that is living, watch some gameplay before you make assumptions and buy. These devs have never showed anything that they do not plan on implementing. Right now the game is in a standstill for update releases. They are working on a full planet system with procedural generation. A larger task is ahead of them and I'm glad they are putting forth all of their effort in doing that instead of weekly updates. Do not expect a refund, do not expect or speculate on anything that isn't already in the game. There is nothing in the world that prevents a company from exiting early access before the customers think the game is done. As with all early access games, don't expect more and cry when there isn't. I give this game a 6/10 right now. It's fun, playable and has enough features to keep you entertained for a bit. If it had more, then I would give a higher rating.			"

								Perhaps one day this will be an awesome game, but currently the engine suffers far to greatly from physics lag even on the smallest of builds to be any thing more than a flashy sandbox game that promises more then it can deliver without sitting at 1 fps for 15 minutes while it attempts to calculate its own physics. So far the game is just yet another one of the hundreds of block based building games on the market. I hope one day they can improve the physics issues, but until that day i would recommend avoiding it.			"

								Unfortunately I wouldnt recommend the game just yet until they have more utilities and tools to make and mine resources like space engineers, however the survival mode it all of what it seems either. Instant building takes out the fun of survival, gathering resources and building stuff out of those resouces. Its just too early to do anything with the game, until they improve on it some more. I do have high hopes for this game regardless. I hope it becomes better.			"

								First of all, I love the whole idea. And since I've played Space Engineers, I decided to pick up this game and give it a try. The idea of being able to freely build and construct in medieval settings speaks to me, and I can imagine many others. There are just some issues that makes it unplayable. 1. Optimisation. I know that the game is in Alpha state, and developers prioritising content over optimizing it. My rig is quite strong, but I still have to play this on low settings due to the pure lag and sometimes freezing of the game when blocks start to crumble, or walls falling apart, not to mention it restrict you as a player to build small, stripping a lot from the game already.2. Content. Now, it has a lot of basic content for us to get starting and building, but it still aint fun when after an hour or so, you've basically gone trough it all. And as aforementioned, the poor optimization prevents from building any larger structures without having to sarcrifice something.All in all, a good game but I think it needs to mature a bit more as we say around here. It needs a lot of work before it can be proper played and immersed into, the only thing at the moment keeping it alive, would be the mods.			"

								How to play Medieval Engineers : 1: Buy Space Engineers instead.The game was interesting to say the least at first. Instead of starships and space stations, you make castles and catapults and such.   A refreshing change you could say,  but it quickly wore off.  And I mean quickly.The game is dead, has been since release. It never gets updated. The servers are too buggy to play on(if they even have any players)   KSH pretty much just used this game as a template for creating planets in Space Engineers(which is a FAR better game by the way, it has a ""somewhat decent"" player base, gets updated regularly, has MUCH more to do, ect).After planets were introduced to Space Engineers, Keen Software House pretty much cut off Medieval Engineers like it was a leg with severe gangrene.I wanted to like this game. But as it is, there is simply no substance, no gameplay, just mindless building. It would be fun if there was a dedicated RP server with huge bustling cities and alot of players, but you will never find that here.     Buy Space Engineers instead.     Even then I can't promise you will get your moneys worth of gameplay.			"

23 minutes played is all i needed to give this game a huge thumbs up.Pro's Very impressed with how optimized it is despite its infancy as a project, I experienced frame drops as i pin pointed my cannon balls to key locations to bring down the entire castle at once, however I am running a 6 year old i7-950 with a GTX 660, with the graphics set to max. I honestly expected lockups w/ all those physics calculations, not mere frame drops. I was surprised how attractive the landscape, especially considering all Keen has done for years is build large rocks Keen Software House is a bright spot on the muck that is early access games, Space Engineers has had a wonderful development cycle and the developers have proven they are competent and capable of acheiving the goals that were paying money for Very reasonably priced right now at $15, I would had paid this for the blowing things up aspect aloneCon's Currently the only aspect is building and blowing things up. do not buy this if you expect a survivorlist mode on par with SE (yet) If your computer is potato powered the physics based rendering system in this game is not going to go well, however i feel relunctant to list this as a con because its 2015 and you could go and build a PC capable of crushing this game for $800SummaryBuy this game, support these guys, they truely deserve it. If you are at all skeptical because you have never heard of them before, just check out the update logs for Space Engineers, their other project, I am confident all your worries will be laid to rest.

								Medieval Engineers is extremely fun, especially for an early access game. There are plently of parts, moving and static, that you can build with and create contraptions out of. The controls are easy to learn, and the physics are spot on. Want to build a treuchet? Do it! Want to build a castle on top of a mountain? Go for it! Want to turn the world to rubble? Go ahead! The possibilities are endless, and it will keep you occupied for hours.10/10 would shoot a barbarian off a cliff again			"

								A good building game, with realistic physics (most of the time) , a growing pallette of blocks to choose from, active updates and more! Although I have yet to really find the best ways to utilize the mechanism parts, I've had a blast making my first proper fortification, and look forward to what they bring out next. The pvp capabilities do seem a little limited, but with the addition of the crossbow it's definitely a lot more possible in the terms of the siege scenarios. Would recomend to any friend interested in building, while I would wait to alert those looking for pvp, aside from castle destruction.*Pros-Good selection of blocks-Beautiful scenery-Realistic physics and destruction-Creative tools are a huge boon *Cons-Higher requirements limit the numbers during sieges-Pvp isn't optimized, but on it's way*Suggestions-Team owned bots (Archers acting simmilar to the turrets perhaps?)-Better gear system to optimize moving energy from power source (windmill) to mechanism (Gate / drawbridge / trap/ etc)			"

If you do not like to wait for new features then this game is not for you in its current state however space engineerscame out in a similar state to this game and it is now a really in depth sandbox, so who knows how quickly this game will develop. but based on space engineers development over the last 6 months i would expect to see it moving a long very quickly.

								lets start at the point of the issue of crahing i never did so its not a problem of mine, also the only problem i had is lag and that was after a big♥♥♥♥♥2,016 block wall and a 125 block wall but with a big wall like that i expect lag. I enjoy the game and I think its worth the 15 or 18 dollars depending on if you want the deluxe edition or not. Overalll I think if you liked space engineers and you like the old periods of the time back then, its a must grab.			"

								Played a little bit of this and the building is certainly fun, though getting used to the controls (especially ground leveling) takes a while to do. Impressive in the structures you can build in it, especially for an Early Access, and I'm sure it will continue to grow as features are added in.That being said, the features I would very much like to see added:-Gathering: We can knock down trees, but... do what with them?-Planting: I'd like to be able to create a forest where I'd want it.-Water (rivers/lakes): Seriously my biggest glaring issue was that the fields have no water. Castles are almost -never- built without a water supply nearby. Would like to be able to place springs to start river flows through channels. (I know this is a difficult one, fluid physics in a game tend to be the most difficult ones, but it feels like a dead world without it).			"

								Keen Software House did it again, I thoroughly enjoy my time being spent with Medieval Engineers along with Space Engineers. the latter is spectacular and now this....... this just amazes me with all the potential it brings boys and girls.Medivieval Engineers is a voxel based game with the newly added terriforming capabilities that gives the correct tools to bring ones gaming experience to a new level. build a castle, homestead, or reanimate landscapes that you could only dream of. The building is excellent with easy to use instructions and hotkeys, have four different sets of customeizable keys at your will to make what you please. I am eagerly waiting for the RELIABLE updates these guys bring and the loyal development they bring to the table(been here since SE launch). Keensoftware house builds games, communties, and friends without effert due to there hard earned ethics. if you second guess alpha launches or early acces develpment, there is nothing to worry about here, join in and have fun, watch this baby grow into a giant!

								Great game! There is a lot of things to play around with already in alpha. Do you feel like building a crane using some ropes or custom built gears? Then go ahead and do so. The building aspect of the game is fun and unique because of the structural integrity. However you do notice there are so bugs and glitches every now and then. Something which can be expected as it is in fact a game in alpha. But I do still highly recommend it as this is a game that will get a lot better futher into the development.			"

								Despite the fact this game is in early access and still under heavy development, It's early features and physics never seize to amaze so early early on in the games development.For me, when it comes it Medieval Engineers, the only thing more fun than building a castle is destroying a castle, and the game developers have perfected just that. With the Infrastructure setting enabled, too much weight on top of something or   destableization of the bottom part of a structure will compromise It's integrity, and cause it to topple to the ground leaving nothing but I gient pile of rubble. When this reaction occours on a large scale, it could make you lag untill all the rubble has stoped tumbling.At the games current state, I admit there is not too many blocks to use, and also there is not yet Multiplayer, but I am certain they will release it soon, as in Space engineers. You could be reading this many updates into the future, where Multiplayer and a lot more things have bean introduced.Overall, Medieval engineers is a fantastic game, and whenever you may be reading this, there are still many more updates to come!

Mainly when objects break and fall. It's not little objects, it's the large number of objects that are in motion. The grass and flower animations are unaltered. Trees break fine without issues. It's when I smash stone walls or other thick and large objects. Other than that, the game is fun, but is better played with friends.			"

								A game that appeals to the history buff or the engineer that may be lurking inside us.  It's not fast paced.  You aren't holding off elves.  Half the stuff you see in the intro video isn't in the game yet as of this writing.  But for those of us who may have enjoyed bridge engineering games, or sandbox modes in castle games, this game is for you!  Plus, who doesn't enjoy shooting at your own stuff?  It's like being seven again and being allowed to throw marbles at your brother's block towers!			"

								This is an early access game so it's not anywhere near complete yet and what features it does have do have some glitches.  However, it gets updated every week and is already a lot of fun.  It satisfies 2 primal urges:  the need to build your own caslte, and the need to destroy castles.  Doesn't everybody want to do that?Just don't get too attached to anything you make right now, or rely on mods, because it's quite likely, probably a certainty, that changes to the game will break your stuff on a regular basis.  But that's OK because they've got a lot of blocks to add still, and those will make your old stuff obsolete anyway.So go ahead and get it.  You'll enjoy it.  Just be sure to read the help screen, watch the tutorials, watch user videos, and check the forums for help and solutions.			"

								(Understand that I am doing a review about the ""Early Access"" version, it's still under construction as we speak)When ""Space Engineers"" came out, it's one of the best ""Sandbox"" style games I have ever played. Games like ""Rollercoaster Tycoon"", ""Theme Hospital"", and ""Theme Park"" are nothing compaired to the idea that it's SO MUCH BETTER when you are able to make the buildings, mechanics, and animations yourself. Who cares if you can build a ""pre-made"" building, making the building itself with all the animations is so much more rewarding because you, the designer, made the building yourself.Now, the people that brought you ""Space Engineers"" goes and makes this game, ""Medieval Engineers"".  If you ever wanted to make your own castle, village, or small settlement, and design it however YOU wanted it to look like, now you actually can. Set up a small location, build a small village with a blacksmith, Inn, store, farm, or build your ideal castle. The game itself has enough mechanics to be able to build whatever you need, however you want it to look. You can use stone blocks or wood blocks with either stone or wood platforms, walls, stairs, ceilings, roofs, and so much more. There's even mechanical devices you can use to make such things as windmills, cranks, even design your own contraptions such as catapults, on wheels even.Every effort has been made to create ""realism"" in every way. Personally, my only reason for getting this game was because I loved ""Speace Engineers"". This game is now my second love. If you have played ""Space Engineers"", then you can't go wrong with this. Designing just got better. Just like ""space Engineers"", it's about what you want to build, how you wanted to look. [OH FOR PEEK SAKES, JUST GET THE GAME AND START BUILDING ALREADY] ^_^			"

								Let's get this out of the way: This game is not even remotely close to being in a state that meets the expectations you might have after watching the video trailers. You are extremely limited in what you can do at this time.Essentially, you only have 'creative mode' available to you at this moment, but if Keen updates this with the same pacing and quality of Space Engineers, then you can expect frequent and awesome changes to come hard and fast. DAY 1 Pros: -Textures (even if placeholders) are beautiful and rich. The forest landscape reminds me of Elder Scrolls Oblivion. -DirectX 11 and multithreading offer stability and  terrific multiplayer opportunities down the road.-Destruction is very well designed and the physics seems solid. Day 1 Cons:-If the projectiles are the same mass and velocity to the eventual siege weapons, then stone walls will need to be a lot more durable, because right now they seem to be as strong as cardboard. -No multiplayer or survival at day one. This is expected, but I just want it to be obvious if you are going to buy the game based on that. -A distinct lack of goats. Summary: Game has extremely high amounts of potential and is already fun to tinker about inside the world. Software company that makes it is very considerate of their players and will update frequently and deliver.			"

								I love Space Engineers.This game (to me) kicks the hell out of Space Engineers.It's been on Steam for a day, and it's already in a very stable condition, despite being in alpha. If this game progresses as well as Space Engineers has been, it's going to be unbelievably fun with unlimited possibilities, given that your machine can handle it. Only bad thing I'm noticing right now is spontaneous collapse of wooden floors and difficulty using some brushes where there shouldn't be any issues. Even with these things considered, I'm not even slightly worried, This developer is on top of things.If you have Space Engineers, but want a different environment with different rules to play with; buy this NOW!!!!!!mferlbefkb .kwbrwk!!!!!!!!

								This game, is fun. When I got in I tried to make a catapult... then realized I dont know how. It may seem similer to spaceengineers, because it was made by the same people, but its pretty diferent , even in very early alpha/beta.  right now all you can do is playaround in singleplayer creative, but when the suvival, and multiplayer come out, this game will be amazing. I actually like the building alot more in this than in space engineers. The reason for that being you have to think about how are you going to build it first. I found myself actually going as far as planning out the shape, size, and even were the supports were going to be. The only thing better than building a wonderfull building, is watching as that same wonderfull building crumbles to the ground.Another thing, if you are going straight from space engineers to this, you WILL need to watch the tutorial video for the game. The bulding system is similer, yet different. different in the fact that you can place multiple blocks in the same block, and there is structual intefrety. While structual integrety is toggelable, via the world edit menu, if you want to build somthing nice, you have to learn the mechanics.overal score = I expect more from this than space engineers (10/10)			"

								- - - -I will update this review as the game updates. Most recent review update: 3/3/15- - - -This game is incredible and exactly what I paid for. A game stressed upon physics that has near limitless capabilities, based upon construction, destruction, rinse and repeat. 8/10, but since it came out only a few days ago, I'd say it deserves those extra points for being this fantastic right from the get-go. If you want an awesome game, buy now. If you want a game you'll(or at least I'll) play for the rest of your life after a few months period of updates, Buy. Now. All in all, there are some drawbacks, but it's almost 98% positive fun gameplay. That is, if your ""Fun"" includes architectural design and physics used to demolish everything in sight.+Positive++Even the medium graphics are incredible. If you have a tough system, please play on the highest graphics possible, for the beauty of the scenery is astounding. +30 points+The physics engine is to DIE for. I've been craving a game of this caliber for my entire life. Want a bridge that splits in the middle and slides into sockets? Do it. Want a machine gun catapult? Do. It. Want a rope suspended bridge that rebounds against cannon balls? Do. +70 points+The versatility of what you can make is awe-inspiring. You could make a system of pulleys and winches that operates 20 catapults surrounding a castle to demolish it in one fell swoop(or alternatively, miss with every single one and destroy your beautiful catapults.). +40 points+Realizing what I've said earlier, I'd like to build upon it all. Since windmills are most definitely usable, you could make. A fully automated, wind powered line of catapults that reloads itself and launches projectiles infinitely until it runs out of ammo. +(does this even count)10 points+It just came out and it's this good already. Also, frequent updates. +50 points+Barbarians are cool and the fact that they were added in earlier than they should have is good to see their mechanics beforehand and find good ways to build defendable fortresses before their AI gets revamped. +10 points-Negative-These points generally have more written, but that's because they need more explaining.-Long loading times, but this is expected if you've played Space Engineers, and isn't really a problem once you've got a world loaded. -5 points-Lag. If you have a system with generally low specs, you might want to consider getting a new computer to play, or taking countermeasures to weaken the game's stress on your speed. However, having a low-end computer myself, the lag is not unbearable, and fully understandable considering the powerful physics engine. -10 points, though this is only a user-related issue. If you have a strong system, BUY.-One of the core reasons there is so much lag is the worlds. Sure, the forests look beautiful, but I'm in creative mode. Shouldn't I get a choice of a very small world with no forests? The trees and the rest of the world are a source of great lag, while I am trying to build a trebuchet to demolish this finely structured building in front of me. Smaller worlds are needed. -30 points-No legitimate hands-on tools/weapons. What I mean is this: Space Engineers had player-wielded machine gun rifles, yes? Then these engineers should get swords. I want to sword fight on my castle as it crumbles. Obviously this shouldn't be stressed until multiplayer comes, or DEFINITELY when true NPC raiding parties come. Also, the raiding parties should not be limited to swords, they should get at least simple siege weaponry i.e. a catapult they pull with them. Also, when these NPCs do come around, ideally they should be able to take keeps and/or spawn in keeps with the map, so they can be raided and taken over. -5 points-There is a moderately bad bug involving broken stone cubes, I believe it is due to parts of the stone cubes that DO break getting partially lodged in the unbroken parts, keeping them both elevated and preventing you from placing blocks for repairs unless you damage the block further yourself(which can cause more damage to the surrounding area) and dig a hole underneath, place a block so that the physics reload and the fragments fall, and fill the hole back up, all so you can make repairs. Also, sometimes the fragments that are stuck midair cannot even be broken. This is but a small bug however, and I pretty much covered the whole thing in that paragraph. -5 points (Partially fixed the bug. You go, guys!)After all that, still +155 points.The best part of all of it? Mindless destruction. And why that is the best part is that it's not even mindless. It takes full consciousness and mental focus to build a machine capable of laying waste to fortresses from afar. Thank you, thank you for this wonderful gift of a game. And I thought SPACE Engineers was good. Compared to this, I'd say SE is half the game this is/will be.			"

If you want a more polished game i suggest you wait a while but for those who dont care and wanna build till they run out of things to destroy then this is definetly a game for you!!			"

								Keen Software House is the best example of Early Access you can get! They keep in contact with the community. They make meaningful updates weekly. They are very honest and open about their plans and direction with the game, and best of all THEIR GAME WORKS! Medieval Engineers -- aside from some bugs and optimization -- is already at a state where they could go full release! The building mechanics are solid and it doesn't take long before you're making your dream castle! They give you enough tools to let your imagination run wild, especially the blocks within blocks tool! Compound blocks allows you to invent new blocks on the fly to suit your design, making you have that extra level of detail to any creatoin. The added structural integrity mode makes building feel more like a challenge. You have to be aware of how much weight is being placed on certain blocks. It adds an air of tension while you're building, ""Oh gosh will this block be the one to ruin my castle?"" The game gets a new sense of tension in this mode and I love it for this! This game is a near perfect and its not even finished! Keep going Keen Software House! You are the reason for Early Access!			"

								I really want a refund. Unfortunately, I didn't know about the steam refund system when I bought this game, or I could've saved 20 bucks. This game is, to state it, really bad. It has the same problem Space Engineers has, but to a much worse degree. It is not optimized for survival. Survival on SE is possible, and really enjoyable, but really hard at the same time to get the reasources for and build a giant ship that looks dang cool. I was on a server once, and I saw these guys that had this, like, almost proxy castle and they told me they had spent a month building it. and this was just a castle built out of two, three materials. Wood, wood bark, and stone. I also looked at it and sighed, knowing that it would be destroyed relatively soon by pirates or something. Don't buy if you like making progress in survival quickly, or like building cool things quickly			"

Tooltips would help a long way in the game but are missing in action.Survival mode is just flat out terrible at the moment also as you can not get anything done without constantly being annoyed by the steam of invaders running up to take the cart or breaking everything .

								This has the shell of a great game, and I did have some fun with it. I only tried survival mode, which contained a few bugs. I would like it if the NPCs work better. The time it takes on your own to gather the materials to build anything significant necessitates the use of NPCs, but in my experiences, especially with a mining NPC, he usually gets stuck on a bit of the environment. Also the UI could be better. I would not recommend this in its state now, unless you would be really interested in seeing its development, and definitely do not expect something with the level of polish of Space Engineers.			"

								For those who are looking at this game because they loved Space Engineers:Think hard before buying this one. In fact, if you're going to buy it, read up on how to play a little bit first, then buy it and dive in so you can get a good taste before you hit the two hours mark. That way you can return it for a refund if you don't care for it.This game is simply too rudimentary and clunky if you're already used to Space Engineers—it feels like this game was branched off from SE and then it was never able to catch up. The survival mode is sorely lacking in polish, but if you are a  creative mode-only player then you won't mind. The controls are inexplicably awkward for a SE veteran. You'll have as much stutter as on a SE planet, and there's no space mode to save you from it here.This game can still shine for you depending on what you're looking for, but the odds are against it so go in prepared to eject and perhaps you'll be pleasantly surprised.

								Cannot recommend it in its current state. So laggy and unoptimised its a joke. Physics decide to randomly change throughout a game session - you can build a castle and 3 hours later it collapses even though you're working on a different part of the map and haven't touched it. Main stone building blocks collapse under their own weight. Blocks keep getting removed and the whole game is quite limited. Give it 3 years and it might be playable at the current rate of development.			"

								I bought this game after seeing amazing graphics and cool physic system.  My computer is a high end modle that can handle almost any game but this game...  The game lags so much that after all of their updates to this point it is now unplayable.  I figured that there could be some fps problems especially with the physic system but I thought they would have optimized the game by now.  Nope...  Oh and how is this game survival?  It is kind of survival now but not really.  I think the develpers bit off too much.  Perhaps they should of made a gaming series from this where they add dramatically new features in the next addtion of the game.  Really cool concept, too much to implimate in one game and keep it lag free...  Maybe, just maybe they will get their act together and finish this game right, but I am not holding my breath, already uninstalled it.			"

								May change my review as game develops.Currently, great concept but limited content. Played survival mode with barbarians turned off - I like the idea of having to source food and materials to build my project, but being interrupted by barbarians every few minutes is tiresom. Made a little cottage after a painful learning curve.Biggest problem is lack of intuitive controls/construction AND there not being enough (up to date) out-of-game support to help find out how to do what I wanted.My pile of stone for some bizzare reason dissappeared (all but one boulder), while my pile of round logs remained fine. Shrug, perhaps they sunk into the grass or something.Couldn't work out how to construct a long length of round log... could only do it by joining 20 tiny round log peices , which is insane since each tiny peice used up a full round log resource (each of which was the length I wanted). This annoyed me immensely and I have given up.			"

Not to mention that anything larger than a Medium House (Normal Size = 10x10x10 for me) can slow you game down.AI: Stupid ... nuff said and its stupid ... its sometimes helpful but mostly annoying.Gamemodes: -Creative ... a Buggy mess wich is actualy the most working part of the game ... if it werent for the complete misplaced Button or Keys (Said by a Regular Space Engineers Player)-Survival ... dont try it with and Without Barbarians ... it makes the already Hard Creative up to a Way to hard Survival ... its nearly Unplayable as its not Only Boring as hell but also barely works as storage comes in chests wich ... arent implemented in Survival Yet ... i think but even if they are they can at max store 10 Stones so its a waste. Also not mentioning that even if you Manage to create something you are likely to die many times.Overall: They need to fix the godam game ... i am serious ... they need to fix it or it will stay like this. And if you look at the Time i played you can trust me when i said that i already forced me to find something in this game wich isnt frustrateing or Crashing the game right away.

								This is something that I've wanted for the longest of time, but I just cannot play it. The control scheme is so difficult to use, it feels as though it could be made a lot more user friendly. The movement is also not great; why does the walking have a head-bob? It's not necessary at all. It just makes the placement of objects that much more difficult. The fly mode seems to use an accleration, that could possibly be done better? I'm not too sure, again it just makes the placement of objects that much more difficult. Another thing, why the need for combat and combat NPCs, etc? Why not just leave it at building, I mean it's in the title. If you have the time and patience to learn the control scheme and deal with the clunky movement, then I wholeheartedly recommend this game but for me, those two aspects are key in a building sim and they fall short.

								I like it, but the gameplay is awkward. I have a lot of trouble building, my gaming pc can't run it (not a good enough graphics card), and it's just overall not very fun. It's not evem the building style though, I love Space Engineers, I just don't like this game.			"

								From what little time I've played the game has potential. However if you use Nvidia DO NOT buy this game, there has been a bug with the graphics that makes the game unplayable (InGame screen is a washed out white). The bug has been known for quite sometime, however while updates keep coming out, this doesn't get fixed. So don't waste your money till its fixed.			"

								If you have an Nvidia GPU then don't even bother.  For some reason the game is not compatible, everything is extremely bright as if your gamma was turned to max.  Why this has not yet been addressed in the weekly updates is beyond me.  Sounds like it could be a pretty fun game but not so much if you can't see anything.			"

								I have a fairly decent computer. A Qosmio/Toshiba gaming laptop that's a couple years old. It uses a cooling pad and runs quite well with very recent games. This is the only game that won't run on this laptop. In fact, I can even run Fallout 4 and Cities: Skylines on this computer, to name a few. Medieval Engineers is most definitely NOT recommended if you don't think your computer can handle it with 100% confidence.			"

								Medieval Engineers, although in early access and only being on the shelf for less than a year has enough content to keep me entertained for hours, if it's putting on a podcast and building a huge castle for 3 hours, or downloading other castles from the Steam Workshop and tearing them down with custom build catapults and trebuchets, or maybe trying to survive wave after wave of barbarain attacks at night, and rebuilding in the day. I still have fun doing it. It's core elements would be:*Build as much as your computer can handle *Epic, softbody destruction *Old, over looked genre setting (atleast for a sandbox building game)*Semi regular updates adding bug fixes, new blocks, ect.*Workshop support *Mod support (mods can also be found from the Steam workshop*Major replayability (I come back to this game pretty regularly and when I do it's for hours on end.)*Massive planets you can walk around completley with out loading screens (granted it would probably take you a few hours.)*Different factions to compete with friends *Mutiplayer, allthough in the interest of full disclosure it is fairly buggy and can end with the game crashing.   Yes, this game is glitchy, buggy, it may crash for placing a block wrong, but playing it since it came out I have seen more and more of those bugs go away and the physics engine get more stable. But this game has been out less than a year and is still in early access, yet it has more content and is better crafted than most the early access games on Steam combined. If you're like me who can't get enough of sandbox building games and can look over a few bugs for the meantime then you'll love this. P.S.After seeing all these negitive reviews I thought I should add something else to my review. I've been playing Medeival Engineers since day 1 of launch, I've been following and playing Keen House Software's other game Space Engineers since the Alpha stage, that means I've had plenty of time to play and get to know the games of KHS, and from what I've seen is massive dedication to the games, (One of the first devs to bring weekly updates every Thursday) listening to the players and changing the game to suit everybody, (planets were never going to be a thing in SE or ME, yet the devs managed to put them in after massive fan feedback.)    So to all the people saying they don't listen to players and have quit this game for good, only trying to make a quick buck, you're wrong. At the time of writing KHS has had to stop weekly updates for ME and smaller 'dev builds' for SE this is purely because it takes time just to make the video showing new blocks and features, let alonet the time and thought process needed to implement new features. But as they have shown, it's been well worth the wait due to ME now offically having plants, female engineers, new blocks, ect ect. Just because the Devs go silent for a few days does not mean they've quit the game, after the work KHS has done in the past years I think it's safe to say you can have a little faith in them.			"

								I was reserving my review until the planet update came out so here we go…More than a simple update, what we had here is a whole new start for the game, under the lead of a new team leader, and I must say that it definitely took a step in the right direction.Before this update/relaunch, what you had was more a sandbox than an actual game. It really looked promising as the building mechanics were very interesting and game many creative possibilities.Now, they have introduced these mechanics inside a multiplayer environment where factions, wars, siege and territorial domination are involved and I must say that it is already very interesting.Don’t get me wrong, as it is now, the whole thing is no more than a preliminary draft of what we will have in several months, there some bugs and many fundamental gameplay mechanisms still have to be implemented/changed but it is already very fun.It is also clear that the team is very active. Not only that, but it also listens to the community and actually answer in the forums, this is very encouraging.So, to sum up, this is still not a polished and flawless game, don’t expect this, but there is a huge potential and I believe that the development will be very fast paced form now on.

								Very nice idea and looks amazing, only issue would be the performance drops when you try to destroy a huge castle someone spent hours of their life building brick by brick and then proudly put onto the workshop for players to admire. For an alpha I think this game is great! so satisfying to build and destroy stuff too.

								You will get a bunch of people, many of which are barely literate, who will tell you that this game is a cash in. That the developers are pouring out unfinished games to get the moola. But I don't see this being the case, not while features are being implemented to both games to complement the development. People will tell you that this is the reason they half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Space Engineers, but then again these people were the ones who took frequent updates for granted. Though the game hasn't got too much, which was the case with SE, it is enjoyable if you enjoy building with an added challenge. The game allows you build out fantasy or medieval settings to your heart's content but with the fact these buildings must be constructed with structural integrity in mind.  Due to that system, the destruction of the buildings are incredibly satisfying... or heartbreaking, depending on what side of the wall you're on.  Not forgetting a pully system that puts your medieval engineering to the test with elaborate gates, mechanisms and siege weaponry.The game has a lot of potential in the terms of PVP, Roleplay and Sandbox pleasure you might find in similar games. To say the least, they have added a fresh taste to this somewhat bloated genre. I just hope they make a decent survival element to it all.			"

								This game is wonderful. Even in the current unpolished state, the game is addictive and hits a chord that few other games can hit. The destruction physics are entertaining and challenging. The desire to build is constantly driven by ""how big can I make this"" and ""how can I hit this with a cannonball and make it fall"". As features continue to expand, I expect to see this game become a wonderful gem of the gaming world. I would disreguard most of the negative reviews on here because they seem to have missed the point that this game is in extremely early stages. For it to function as it does with the minimal bugs and issues is very impressive. As well, the dev team is extremely invested and dedicated to giving the community what they want. The collaborations between the Medieval and Space engineers devs is something of a golden goose. Expect to see a lot of wonderful new content in Space Engineers as well as ME. If you are truly interested in this game, don't hesitate, support the devs now and save yourself some cash. You won't regret it.(Also disreguard the lack of hours as I have been extremely busy and haven't been able to play as much as I wish.)			"

Get this gameAll of that being said, this game is still very early access, there are a lot of things to be done.  There is no survival mode, but the things for it are essentially there, and you can see it all coming together.  You do not have to build on a plane if you wish not to, as there is a new dynamic construction mode.  Definite fun, especially with a friend, the possibilites are endless.

								Lets start with the good I suppose:This game has a lot of promise. The possibilities for what you can do with this game are seemingly endless. Like its sister product, Space Engineers, you can build almost anything that you can imagine. The game makes you think about how something should go to gether to make it work and be stable. Unlike SE, you get the chance to use physics and structural integrity to guide your building and creating. This game also allows you to destroy creations, with great destruction animations and effects. This game has a lot of potential, and I am eagerly awaiting the next update.Now its time for the Bad, as everything has a pro and con.The dev's have decided to ""temporarily"" delay updates so that the engineers of the game can create and develop without the stressors of having to meet a weekly quota. This seemed fine to me at the beginning, but that was back in May and we have yet to recieve a single update, and it is now August. The ""Dev Diaries"" seem to showcase a lot of realy cool and interesting stuff, but we can't actually interact with any of the changes. There is no ""Development Build"" for the consumers, aka the people who paid for this game, to actually enjoy anything that they are making. I have the dev build for space engineers, but none available for medieval engineers, which I honestly enjoy playing more. I understand that the dev's have a lot to do and a few major overhauls of the game, but going three, almost four months without an update, while space engineers is still recieving one every week is kind of a slap in the face to the consumer. Overall I would recommend this game, because even in it's current buggy, unfinished, jittery state this game can still be enjoyable. I have high hopes and expectations for what the dev's have been working on for three months, and I really hope that they will release either a dev build or an update that covers at least some of what they have been working on.Current state rating will have to be a 4/10 overall, but with what the dev diary has showcased I could give this game an 8/10.

								Quite a fun take on medieval physics.  And by that, I don't mean magic ... but rather a nicely filled out physics engine that implements what they call ""structural integrity"".  Take a cannonball to a tower,  and it logically takes damage.  That is, load bearing walls, when hit, cause the loads they are bearing to fall, as well.Quite an entertaining early access game.  I look forward to being able to play it multiplayer!			"

								People often talk about how awful Early-Access games can be due to the lack of a quality guarantee. Having bought Space Engineers and seeing it change and develop, I have high hopes for this game along with high expectations. With a new setting this game could do so much, but only time will tell if that will turn out to be the case.			"

								Its very cool game. I cant build a castle yet but its my fault by forgetting that when u place a stone block on top of wood , it breaks xD I have a little problem today of logging in, when ever i log in it kicks me out of the game. I hope it fixes soon but i know its early game so i kind of expected problems. Any way its a great game for some one that has imagination and would totaly recommend it. I would not recommend it for people who try to build for example a castle and leave it after 5 minutes. :)			"

Early Access Review
								When I first saw this game I knew that I had to have it, so I did. The reason why I came to such a quick conclusion was that in the first videos of release they gave such broad and unbelievable promises that I knew that I couldnt miss out. Now the first problem you might have to my conclusion would be that promises are not always kept. To that I say, look at their other game Space Engineers which I also have and as far as I can tell they do keep the promises they make. So, lets get into the loves and wishes I have with this game. First of all I love the unique building where you can combine different blocks in the same voxel although there are a few bugs where you cant put them together, but with time I am sure they will be fixed. The worlds are just the right size, but I really would love biomes which I expect they will add. Also the clan system they have is great, but I would like a bit more of an incentive to attack others. Keeping with the clans I wish there were barbarian clans  in single-player and maybe even multi-player that fight each other and you with a bit more than a sword and pickaxe.(Maybe catapults and trebuches) I like the system of mining, but I dont like the long wait in between destruction of the terrain which Im pretty sure they said they would fix. I like how you can destory much of the land, but I hope they will add a way to add land in survival. Getting away from that I enjoy the NPCs, and cant wait to be able to get them in survival. Now getting into the topic I dread, but am hopeful about ,Multi-player. Multi-player is in a state that doesnt really work at the moment, but they are trying to make it better which gives me assurance that one day it will be very bearable to play with others.(Maybe even fun and enjoyable) All in all there are many things I would like, but if you are hesitant to buy this games then either wait for more updates or get it now, although I would definitely get it in the end game.

								I bought this game the day before the relaunch, and the difference is night and day.  Yes the game is still incomplete in many areas, but is now a whole lot more fun and a lot less frustrating. There are now reasons to explore the planet and stake out your own claim, build up your house and castle, and pillage other players.  The online experience is incredibly stable for Space Engineers and Medieval Engineers.  At the launch stream, we got 79 players all on one server and the game still ran.  You obviously need good hardware to host a game of that size, but the game itself is remarkably stable.			"

								Lets start with the good I suppose:This game has a lot of promise. The possibilities for what you can do with this game are seemingly endless. Like its sister product, Space Engineers, you can build almost anything that you can imagine. The game makes you think about how something should go to gether to make it work and be stable. Unlike SE, you get the chance to use physics and structural integrity to guide your building and creating. This game also allows you to destroy creations, with great destruction animations and effects. This game has a lot of potential, and I am eagerly awaiting the next update.Now its time for the Bad, as everything has a pro and con.The dev's have decided to ""temporarily"" delay updates so that the engineers of the game can create and develop without the stressors of having to meet a weekly quota. This seemed fine to me at the beginning, but that was back in May and we have yet to recieve a single update, and it is now August. The ""Dev Diaries"" seem to showcase a lot of realy cool and interesting stuff, but we can't actually interact with any of the changes. There is no ""Development Build"" for the consumers, aka the people who paid for this game, to actually enjoy anything that they are making. I have the dev build for space engineers, but none available for medieval engineers, which I honestly enjoy playing more. I understand that the dev's have a lot to do and a few major overhauls of the game, but going three, almost four months without an update, while space engineers is still recieving one every week is kind of a slap in the face to the consumer. Overall I would recommend this game, because even in it's current buggy, unfinished, jittery state this game can still be enjoyable. I have high hopes and expectations for what the dev's have been working on for three months, and I really hope that they will release either a dev build or an update that covers at least some of what they have been working on.Current state rating will have to be a 4/10 overall, but with what the dev diary has showcased I could give this game an 8/10.

								Game has potential, I did recieve it for free. So yea it has optimization issues, but what game doesn't that is trying to achieve something more than what's already been seen and done. For any of you stating that the game should already be optimized and blah blah blah, that's like saying ARK should've been optimized before release. Yet, ARK is still Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. Only reason why this game has gone to hell is the lost of content and updates. It's a lost project since it's brother Space Engineers has become much more successful. Not getting paid anything to post this positive review so don't hate. I really don't care to hear anymore trolls, but I do wish that I could've seen what this game would've been if it actually was paid more attention to. R.I.P Medieval Engineers, you were the start of the next gen games, and now you will be forever forgotten, and if not forgotten, remembered as a crap game.Developers, I wish I could've seen the game completed. Sucks that you just dropped it, and didn't finish what you started. I understand Space Engineers is much more successful, but this game could've too. You guys took the easy way out. A lot of people paid money for this is was left with a game %40 complete. I am surprised that a lot of people bought your brother game since you guys just dropped this one. Got lucky if you ask me.

								Is this game worth it? In its current state, no, but thumbs up for potential. If you really want it, get it on sale.With the multiplayer function, you and your friends can build quite the castle, or fort, or whatever cool thing. No special setup is needed to host, so you just need a good PC and decent internet. Plus, you can conduct seiges, which are fun.The structural integrity is cool, and you won't have trouble building. However, it's a little generous on the strength, so things somethimes don't crumble as you'd want them too, or don't reflect what they would actually do.You can build tunnels, and if you had the patience, you could make a full town underground. If you're digging a basement with a pickaxe, then you need to be careful because if you head to the bottom of your hole and turn around, you risk falling through the ground, which then you must kill yourself and lose everything of value on hand.Again, good game, but wait for it to develope more before buying.

								well I bought and installed it lastnight, and I was kinda discouraged by the slow pace and odd building style so I turned the game off and went and watched some movies. Later on I turned it back on just to give it another try before I think about the waste of money I am going to uninstall like so many others. That's when we (me and the game) just clicked, something magical happened that lured me in, and now 5 hours later at 5am I have a giant castle wall a very nice farmhouse with horse stables and a working windmill... As of now I don't want to put the game down but I have to go to sleep for work in the afternoon. The game itself doesn't have much to it as of yet, no NPC's, no multiplayer, no sort of interaction at all. But what it does have is beautiful graphics, sweet mechanics, good ole fashioned creative mode with quite a few different starter maps, and the ability to teraform entire mountains or sling cannonballs at whatever creation you make (or the provided premade buildings). Pick it up while it's on sale, it's well worth the price, heck I'd even pay full price for it because I've seen the hard work the devs have put into Space Engineers and I'm sure this one's going to come along nicely.

								I do reccomend this game;in it's current state (just been released) you can already mod the game and it has full workshop support.The developers are one of the best there has been for quite some time, if the community really wants a particular update, the developers will add it, the next thursday. Currently you can build catapults and trubuchets and drawbridges and anything else you can come up with that is mechanical and involving wieghts, ropes and rotating wood.The destruction is also very nice, the block crumble into chunks and look very pretty.  the game overall looks very pretty in fact. And, if you have played KSHs other game: space engineers, you will know how satisfying it is to build an impressive contraption or building and know that it works.However, It is still a little glitchy (a lot of the glitches can be sorted by youself very easily (a whole bunch were fixed in the last patch). The game runs fairly well and if you can't, the graphics presets, while basic, do offer a decent change in performance at each stage.Overall, This game is definately reccomended by me, and if it is updated as frequently as space engineers is (the developers have promised they will) then this game could become a favourite for many.

Early Access Review
								Hi everyone! This game is awesome. It has went through some changes and it hasnt had much for updates recently, but it is not dead and ME has been working hard on planets update. This is gonna be huge and will bring together our engineers in a multi player world of Physics and war. There is  great community and awesome mod makers. The game lacks the multiplayer aspect that everyone likes so it gets bad reviews from players with little to no hours. That is gonna change and those people dont understand the patience of early access. Hopefuly these people will chgange their mind when planets comes out. Thanks hope this review is helpful			"

								Truly enjoyable constructing game, I have enjoyed SE some 20 odd hours and found this to be more to my taste. Structural integrity is fun to toy around with and can make a serious impact on your build if you don't take it into consideration. I tried to make a huge stone floor, that was about 600+ blocks in total, in one go. And the whole thing collapsed and broke since it was only supported on 2 corners. Looking forward to more content and community mods, because this baby got some serious potential to shine.So if you enjoy to explore mechanics, build castles, build siege engines and medival contraptions, to toy around with physics and general engineering, I say give it a go.

								The soundtrack is really what makes or breaks a game; this is one of those games that the music is phenominal. It has the nostalgic feel of medieval styled instruments, and never before has it felt so epic to build and explore. I can't help but compare this to Minecraft; the building is extensive and entertaining, as Minecraft very well achieved, however this game has the music that makes the game brilliant. Not too much content so far, but I'm sure in a couple months it's gonna be stock full with content.The graphics aren't too bad; they have a Skyrim like feel to them and the scenery looks gorgeous even on low. The game isn't really optimised yet, destroying walls makes my graphics lag. I have a decent graphics card and I hope that the game will get optimisation.What's even better is this is coming from a developer that you can trust; Space Engineers has been out for about a year and every week there's still updates coming out. Just to reassure those who believe that now that this game has come out, Space Engineers is abandoned; that is false. The company who brought you the Engineers games have two teams working on both of the games, each meritting the same style of great game. These 'Engineers' games have been an interesting expirience for I know not just me, but for thousands, if not millions of people worldwide.***Review is Subject to Change***9/10Nice graphicsMinimal bugsGreat interfaceFantastic sceneryBrilliant gameplay			"

								This is a good game as far as i have played, spendt my first hour destroying castles of course. and making catapults, now i have started building with various success as my beautiful home came crumbling down because i didnt supprt the roof. hehe.on the other hand the physics might need some tuning in some areas as i buildt a round tower and managed to seperate it completly from the foundation and still it would fall. hehe.Eighter way im enjoying my self and cant wait for further game content, and got me thinking about a possible multiplayer scenario containing 2-4 players, 1 hour give or take of free building before you have to breach the other ones castles and take the flag. last man with flag wins. that sounded cool :)keep up the good work.

								The studio that brought us Space Engineers now brings us this entirly new game of Medieval engineers. Even though this game is still in its beta stage as I write this I find that this game has potental. The real fun will come when they create the multi player mode as well as any other great add ons with this. The stability of this game is unreal as the creators factor in gravity and balancing what you create to make sure that it doesn't crumble under its own weight.The ancient war machines brought back to life. Create your own world and play to your hearts desire. ~GDS			"

								Its a very good game the Destruction looks wonderfull and the Game has good mechanics it defenetly is a must buy for everybody that loved Space Engineers and Building game fans. The only minus for me is that I start the game with 230 fps but in the loading screen my screen is freezing for 1 min after that I become the message ""Problem with Medieval Engineers apeart game is closed we send a message when we now whats the Problem"".But so far its a very good looking and runs good the Game has a big Potential and it will become a Great game .

								I'm a sucker for any physics based game and this one takes the cake. I feel like this could be an increadible siege multiplayer in the future, but be warned, you will experience lag. I put over $3500 into my desktop in the past year and it still struggles with hardcore demoliton, which is understandable this early in the game. As long as that is worked on, this will be a must own game.			"

								Medieval Engineers is absolutely beautiful and Keen is a developer that follows through on continuous updates and listening to the community.  Unfortunately, right now I wouldn't recommend this game.  There's just not much going on (vanilla version, which I base reviews off of).  You want to build a castle? great.  You want derpy servants that might actually be up to par with medieval intelligence?  Also yes.  Do you want contraptions that actually make sense in a physics based environment?  Maybe someday.For now it's all about the looks and sadly its mechanical blocks fall short of even minecrafts simplistic design.  Still, I have faith in Keen and will be glad to change this review to a plus after a few updates which add real content.			"

								I love space engineers and it's the most played game in my library, when medieval engineers came out I bought it without hesitation, and in the state it was at release it was nigh unplayable.I've never been able to get into medieval engineers. It's just not as good as space engineers, infact it's down right boring. The building is needlessly complex compaired to space engineers to the point where it's not fun or interesting, it's annoying.The AI bots you can spawn in are stupid as hell, and are almost completely incapable of completing the simple tasks they were designed for. You'll tell a bot to chop up a tree and it'll sit there swinging at the ground and digging itself into a hole it then can't escape from. The AI bots are a completely worthless feature that flat out does not work and has never worked since it's implementation.Trying to place something as simple as a wall for example is a MASSIVE annoyance. Between toggling settings, trying to find the sweet spot where the wall can be planted, you need to get right up ontop of the spot you want to place the wall but not too close cause then you can't place it.  It's god damned annoying and frusterating to build anything at all. When compared to how easy it is to snap blocks together and build complex structures in space engineers, it is inexcusable that medieval engineers makes it such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I want to love this game, as much as I love space engineers, but it's not fun in the slightest, it's just annoying. Every few patches I poke my head back in to see if it's gotten any better and it continues to be unacceptably underwhelming and frusterating to do anything. So I'm finally just uninstalling the game, I loved space engineers so much that this game had nigh unshakeable faith from me that it would eventually get better and be just as fun, but I was wrong.

								Medieval Engineers right now is in early access and is lacking many things but as it sits it is a fun testing platform for what is to come. If you like games like say ""The World"", ""Minecraft"", or Medievals older brother ""Space Engineers"" then you will like this game.  Building is simplistic yet deep enough to make some crazy stuff. People have all ready made working differentials ( limited slip type ) and many other complicated things with just the basics in the game now. If creativity is not lacking in you then this game will provide you with hundreds of hours of fun. I give it two thumbs up.			"

								I'm a huge fan of things medieval...I'm also a huge fan of Keen and think they're the best, most honest devs out there who always listen to players and add things in their games they never planned on doing themselves. That said, I'll try not being biased. I'll also try keeping this from being too long.ME is early access...that you should know immediately. Though it's not complete, it has a fully functioning Survival mode with at least some decent amount of content that's more than just harvesting resources to build with. Along with that, here's a more detailed list of some things currently in game (which will probably change tomorrow and the week after and so on):-real physics. Watch castles and towns crumble to the ground under their own weight or from projectiles hurled through the air-a failly detailed crafting system...i.e. gather iron ore for smelter, take ingots to smithy, grab sticks and other objects from the forests and ground to complete items, ect.-Houses and banners which make online a lot more fun especially for role-playing. Gather your friends under one banner and declare war on enemy territories.-voxel based terrain to modify worlds or builds in creative to come up with endless creative ideas-grid-based construction that's also dynamic...this isn't like Minecraft. You build single structures on their own grid, but different structures can face any angle you'd like-Farming! This is a nice recent addition to the game and greatly enhances survival play and playing with friends.If you're creative and like medieval times, you could have endless fun on here. Keen updates every week on Tuesday and to give you an idea of early access, thier other game Space Engineers only recently (late 2016) hit official 'beta' status on Steam, after like 3 years in early access. This game is about to hit 2 years old in Feb. That means at least about 60 more updates to look foward to, which may include a wide range of new blocks tools or items, game mechanics, AI additions or changes, and more before it could hit official beta. And then it'll still be updated after that to continue making it a full game. And honestly, I think this one has a lot more potential than SE did.			"

								i can reccomend this, but i have a few downsides to point out:Pros:CastlesCatapultssmaking barbarians from very high placesCons:Bad combat mechanicsneed a beefy computer to runphysics engine needs a sort of lag proofing (in castle seige i kept dieing due to clipping into the machines)Toll range needs fixing or the graphic needs to be fixed (either one would do so that when im trying to break somthing down i can tell if im hitting it or not)EDIT: Another notable glitch is where in castle seige you sometimes faze out of existance completely. this is a game-breaking glitch that should be fixed as soon as possible. Also, this glitchmakes it to where you cant type, respawn, or even move your camera.Anyways, im reccomending it because its early access, and the devs have not yet sorted out everything, so the cons (or atleast most of them) are acceptable, for the moment at least.

								I recommend playing bit of singleplayer creative mode first. Play around with mods and different blocks, enjoy the amazing creative world this game has to offer. I've been stuck on this game for days everyonce in a while, and I absolutely love the endless possibilities. I've build detailed cottages, massive castles and creative machinery - block by block. Even tho its still only early access. This game is great so far!Cons: Somehow very low fps, especilally online. In general I would not recommend it online just yet as its a bit buggy and difficult to run (unless you have a very very good computer). My poor AMD HD 7700 can't handle online :(			"

								This game is nowhere near as playable as Space Engineers, and has very little that you can do. While I do have high hopes that it will become something interesting, at this point it is hardly a game at all. I'll definitely be keeping my eye on it and won't be seeking a refund, but I would suggest you look elsewhere if you want to play a medieval themed sandbox, at least until this becomes a more polished title.Edit: I will be seeking a refund on this title after all, including the gift copy I bought for a friend.

								The early release is amazing. There are a few obvious bugs to be scratched quickly but so far this game is already amazing. Unlike Space Engineers I hope this game will become more of a multiplayer survival base game instead of just the space simulator that Space Engineers has been recently. The breaking is amazing and the integrety makes me a little wet but I just hope it doesn't all go to waste and become one of those games I play if I say ""I wonder if I can..."" rather than a game where I can say ""Lets get on a server and make a castle I can defend!""I guess my point here is that space engineers is big on making things never seen with the tools at hand and while I love that about it I hope this game will be playable in survival strongly enough that there will be servers with average players that just want to build and be in a community.Oh btw, 10/10 for an early release. If you enjoy destroying large building that took hours to build you're either going to love it a lot or hate it a lot depending on wether or not you meant to destroy it.			"

								This game.... oh this game!!Let's start off by saying that this is in Early access so expect some things to be weird at times.. However with that said I see this game being one of the best building/engineering game once it's finished.  The physics in this game are what sets it apart from a lot of other building games.  What also makes it unique is the ability to engineer all types of machines and seige weapons for your castles using wood and different medieval enginnering gadgets and techniques.The structural integrity feature is what really makes this game fun but very difficult as well.  If your building can't support its weight then it will come crashing down and you will cry.  I cry a lot because I guess I suck at engineering.All in all this is a really fun game and Keen Software House kicks A$$ with updates weekly with new features and tons of fixes!  Buy this game while it's cheap.  You seriously won't regret it!!			"

Space Engineers was constantly and frequently updated and improved. major game breaking bugs never survived longer than a week before they were hotfixed.  expect much of the same dedcation for this game.And this game is going to be a blast when it hits multiplayer. I have already had tones of fun smashing castles in creative and  can't wait to get this in survival. knowing these devs survival and multiplayer are a few months away not a few years.right at this moment this game is a very early version but it will get better and better in a timely manner.

								At first glance, I thought ""Well, this looks pretty standard as far as building games go"". I've played Space Engineers, and I loved it, and this just seemed like more of the same thing in a different setting. The game is definitely beautiful, as far as looks go, but it was just another typical game where you build things.But it's not. I just discovered ""Compound building"", which is a term I was unfamiliar with. I'd thought of the concept, and that it would be something I'd like in the many years I've played Minecraft, but I'd never seen a game that actually allowed it until this.Guys, it's literally blocks in blocks. You want that wood floor in the same block space as that stone wall? Compound building. It's so obvious that this feature should exist in everything, but somehow it hasn't until now.10/10 would build blocks in blocks again.			"

Wow, this game in it's current state is still one of the best games I've ever played. Although there isn't much to do right now I really felt like I wanted to support development. Everyone has been waiting for a game like this and I can't wait to see what they do with it in the future. "

								After the Space Engineers got tired of building,blowing up, and crashing their designs, they decided to warp back somewhere from the 5th to 15th century time periods. Now with MORE to destroy and a very impressive integrity software, the Space Engineers dubbed themselves.....The Medieval Engineers! Okay now for what I think. With the new update out and all of the previous information I really enjoy Medieval Engineers. As I said the integrity software is VERY enjoyable. I've spent almost 1/2 my time watching large castles and trees fall with awing enviroment interaction. I look forward to every minute I invest into this new development by Keen Software!			"

								Awsome game cant wait to see what is down the road for it. As of now you can build castles seige weapons and much more. the physics system gives the game the feel of constraint as you should have in the medival era, which is a plus. with this game so closely tied to Space Engineers some cool systems that where not at first made for this game might even be added in. This co operation has already benifited space engineers with the recent random generation, and planets which have just been anounced. All in all this game is worth the money already and the dev, Keen Software House, has proven very trustworthy; updating their Space Engineers game ervery week!			"

								I want to help develop this game. PS: This is between better and much better than Space Engineers!  The Engineers franchise is awsome!  Bug 1: Somtimes when you destroy stuff, the debris floats!  FIX 2: There is not totaly realistic phisics, for example, when building a pillar of blocks then building to the side, you can build 10 blocks before it crumbles! PS: the last bit of my blocks were close to the ground.  Also my tower stood with a small support.  UNKOWN 3: On the map Bridges, the wagon makes the bridge crumble.  That shouldnt happen, because it has supports close to each other.  CRASH 4: When playing Bridges, my computer crashed.  Maybe its because I had graphics on presets  low and graghics qaulity on medium, medium is a bit laggy. SUJESTION 5: You should definetly add horses.  Also you should also make it were if a rope is attached to a rock, it shuold snap when under high G (Flying)  SUJJESTIION 6: You shuold add difrent blocks like cogs and gears and stone floors (Sideways variant of the stone wall) and wood panels (Sideways variant of the wooden floor).  Also you shuold add back in the catch blocks with block-type wood inside and add corner variants of the ceiling.  BUG 7:  Sometimes when deleting parts of a gate-type fashion (Wood in the fashion of the drawbridge) it flies, and it is realy easy to emplode when testing.  Also the drawbridges dont go down if as big as entrance with little stopers when retraced.I didnt realy know how to word my thoughts in the most part.Enderborn01			"

								To be perfectly honest this game is one of my favorite games, It was JUST released and already it has an amazing building system, experimental AI and great destruction. The physics are a bit jenky but what can you expect from such an early game. One other problem I have is you can't rotate certain blocks upsidedown or sideways. There is no multiplayer as of yet but as I said before it was just released.The graphics are awesome and you should find no trouble running the game on medium (From my experience).You can edit the terrain using a nice voxel system and even make structures with it.You can build massive and beautiful structures with the even the basic blocks you have currently.Next I should talk about the mechanical machines side of Medieval Engineers.When searching for blocks to use you will find some mechanical bits and bobs, some of those are wheels, rope wheels, weight blocks and wooden rods (And more stuff besides). With this stuff you can build primitive vehicles, elevators, catapults and trebuchets!I have not tested or even looked at the AI in game yet but so far they have been a success to everyone.Overall I would say 8.3.2.0.7/10 if I were a critic, however I'm not one so really that personal score is irrelevant. You should decide whether or not you enjoy the game yourself and buy it :)The people behind SE and now ME need to be hugged for making both games and if you enjoy this game buy Space Engineers or vice versa!It's worth it.

								Built a medieval town, lowered the drawbridge, the physics freaked out, BOOM! Wall and bridge gone.11/10 Would experience bugs againBut seriously, this game has a lot of potential, I hope that the devs can keep up with developing both this and Space Engineers. It could be incredible. Multiplayer, once it arrives, will be amazing. However, at this point the game is bland, with no multiplayer and a not a lot of content. Despite this it is still fun to build and destroy, and do other fun stuff. I give it a thumbs up for the potential. Hopefully it lives up to it.			"

								I was instantly addicted to this game. It's like a better version of minecraft. It takes a little getting used to but after you get the controls down it's really easy. You can build insanely cool castles. I highly recommend it.			"

								People get the impression that this game is for the big people with big PC's, I tell you to not listen to them.I have a puny laptop from 2011 with 1.6 GHZ proccessor, and at min graphics (which are surprisingly good) I can run this game at 24fps, far better than space engineers in that regard, if you like voxel building, like physics, and don't have a good enough PC for space engineers, get this game.

								Warning! Do not buy this game while it is in early access..I bought this when it was first announced and I am sorely disapointed in it's progress. The development is the slowest of any EA title I've experianced. Though not abanddoned completly, the updates all seem lackluster. At this stage, I don't believe it will ever get finished in a satifactory manner before a better game gets released by another Dev. Much like Space Engineers, the actual game mechanics seem to have been neglected in order to work on planets. A cool but unneeded waste of time.They have recently made some noise about doing better. I'll believe it when I see it..			"

I'm just not willing to wait around for a patch for something I dropped $20 on, I know its early access but it should at least start. I'd pass for a while and try space engineers instead, I can actually get it going.			"

								I just played medieval engineers, and decided to write this review even though I played only few houres in the game.The game is amazing . Here are some good and bad points that I think it is importent to give them a try  : Good:1) demolition amazing animation and fun. (There is nothing more fun than destroying stuff you built).2) stunning graphics.3) the possible construction areas, which require creativity and great design (because the laws of physics can be found in the game, not just so building, which adds a challenge and fun).Bad:1) The game takes a long time to to be loaded.2) The ground editor very uncomfortable, and very unfriendly to new players.3) The voice of the barbarians annoying .. would be great if it would be possible to change the sound or mute the barbarians in particular.To improve:I noticed a couple of things I would love if repaired or will be added to the game.1)I think it would be great if you feel the possibility of Ctrl + Z so that we can correct mistakes we made.2) I think that could be great if the world would be added flat type, so that it can be built on a flat surface without shape the surface of the earth.3) Would be great if added to the tool which can erase the ruins. It's quite annoying that you can not delete ruins and each time build a castle tower and he falls to start the game again and build it all again. (I must say that it makes the construction of a castle feel pretty stressful thing).In conclusion, a great game. The game can provide hours and hours of building castles and weapons medieval building demolition, careful planning of buildings.Would be great if he could contain multiplayer game, or at least co-op so that it can be done wars or joint construction (similar to space engineers).Highly recommanded , Buy it now !! 11 \ 10!*by the way  , I apologize for my poor English . Thank you for reading my review :D			"

								**Update ReviewI don't bother with the custom maps anymore.. It is a lot less buggy but still has it's issues, The AI are not as stupid but they are still very very dumb. Building is extremely difficult; you have to look at a block in the just the right way to place it properly for structural integrity and annoying enough to make you want to give up on the game altogether. I have a mid level system and I don't notice any lag issues anymore when i play a built in map with less physics and such. I can't review the servers or multiplayer because there are just never any people online to test it out with. It's showing more potential but the building aspect needs improvement as well as more bug fixes and AI definitely needs improvement. If you have the patience to play; it's so very confusing figuring things out. I hope one day the survival mode can be realistic enough to be playable and the AI can have major improvements so that NPC characters can be a real thing. still don't recommend but it's improving**Early ReviewThis game crashes anytime you make a custom map, survival mode is really buggy and the maps are tiny .. even if it gets finished; this game is not worth the asking price.. do not waste your money			"

								It is a great game with lots of potential. I love the building machanics. But the bugs are enuff to drive you crazy. like rocks jumping around and logs jumping around and killing you, or flying out of your cart and scattering allover the place. They need to work on stability updates . Rather than adding new textures for rocks that cant hold still. And mabey thats why you shouldnt have two early access titles going at a time. But once the main bugs are fixed it will be great. The game is pointless right now, unless you like building and havesting resources that are bugged. Dont waste your time. you cant even build a catapult without it jumping all over and blowing appart. BUT I LOVE THE MECHANICS SO MUCH I STILL PLAY!!! plus it helps the devs when we complain about it.			"

Granted, I am running two GPUs, and there is apparently a known problem with running two cards, but how was I supposed to know that.  I guess I should have done my research.  But, it wasn't a problem with Space Engineers until they added planets (I noticed the other day that Space Engineers seems to have this same problem now as well).  In another thread, one of the developers said they are working on the issue.  Please fix this issue as soon as possible.  I'd love to recommend it, but I can't in it's current state.			"

								The game is well like Everquest landmark and minecraft had baby. And is not an ugly baby.  Its a baby were you build buildings and castle and there are physics were if you don't build it right your structural integrity of your builds could fail and the building could collapse on you. But the game is atm in a creative mode so you can freely build what you like in any way that you want.I would say that this game can go really far and it is really fun when you play with friends. But be warned the game is still in alpha/beta so there is still a ton of work that is needed but the game is worth it if you like to build and destroy stuff.			"

								**Update ReviewI don't bother with the custom maps anymore.. It is a lot less buggy but still has it's issues, The AI are not as stupid but they are still very very dumb. Building is extremely difficult; you have to look at a block in the just the right way to place it properly for structural integrity and annoying enough to make you want to give up on the game altogether. I have a mid level system and I don't notice any lag issues anymore when i play a built in map with less physics and such. I can't review the servers or multiplayer because there are just never any people online to test it out with. It's showing more potential but the building aspect needs improvement as well as more bug fixes and AI definitely needs improvement. If you have the patience to play; it's so very confusing figuring things out. I hope one day the survival mode can be realistic enough to be playable and the AI can have major improvements so that NPC characters can be a real thing. still don't recommend but it's improving**Early ReviewThis game crashes anytime you make a custom map, survival mode is really buggy and the maps are tiny .. even if it gets finished; this game is not worth the asking price.. do not waste your money			"

								Medieval Engineers has very high potential it is hard to criticise it as it is early access however I will say what I can.I simply cannot recommend this game at its current state, it has too many bugs and issues the worst of all is the optimisation of this game is not finished they simply need to tinker and polish a few things and BAM it would be good.I have a decent rig (if you want to know the specs just ask) that is well above recommended settings yet I get at best 7fps... yep thats 7fps it's practically unplayable.The actual game itself will be good in a couple of years when the full versions out and updates upon updates are coming out it could be the next Minecraft, until the developers finish Space Engineers FULLY is when this game will truly shine.KIMBOF1's Score = 2/5The game itself isn't very good and on top of that is a mountain of bugs and issues.Think before you play over 2 hours of this game I tried to get a refund but the Steam Refund Policy states that to get a refund you must have owned the game for under 2 weeks and played it for under 2 hours.

								It is a great game with lots of potential. I love the building machanics. But the bugs are enuff to drive you crazy. like rocks jumping around and logs jumping around and killing you, or flying out of your cart and scattering allover the place. They need to work on stability updates . Rather than adding new textures for rocks that cant hold still. And mabey thats why you shouldnt have two early access titles going at a time. But once the main bugs are fixed it will be great. The game is pointless right now, unless you like building and havesting resources that are bugged. Dont waste your time. you cant even build a catapult without it jumping all over and blowing appart. BUT I LOVE THE MECHANICS SO MUCH I STILL PLAY!!! plus it helps the devs when we complain about it.			"

								This is a reskinned Space Engineers, no doubt about it. But I'm honestly impressed. In just an hour of play I can tell you this game is worth $15. The textures are strikingly beautiful, the building is currently decent with much room for growth, and you can tell that this game will get to be pretty all-around excellent with a bit of love and a lot of added content. Your current options as of now are to build and destroy--and the latter is pretty damn fun. You have no way of actually repairing things yet, like you can in SE. Physics is excellent; object destruction appears very real. I'm interested in seeing mining, refining, and other SE-type properties imported medieval-style.			"

Plus initialy the game was sold as a fortress builder then PvP game where you would have to build your siege weapons and try to assault the enemy fortress but now it tends to be another open world survival crafting early access game (ake The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse tags)...The controls are garbage and the UI is unintuitive since the release of the game...But at least we now have a SFX when we close the doors !

								There is absolutely no optimization, why pay for such a gameplay? And this is after Space Engineers, which was never completed, remained a crude sandbox. Twice in the same trap. Refund.			"

Early Access Review
								From the moment that I saw this game in a Youtube video I know that I had to play it.The first few minutes:After the installation I was quickly confronted with the complexity of this game. Since there is no good tutorial (just annoying text in the middle of the screen) I immediately was forced to watch multiple ""How to play"" video's to get started. I personally do not mind this but I can imagine that other people might find this annoying.Building:The complexity of the Keybindings, moving around and placing blocks are in my opinion too difficult. The way that building blocks can be selected, rotated and placed is just not smooth enough. It somehow feels slow and not efficient, I am sure that this can be improved. The 3rd person camera angle in this game is one of the most annoying elements of this game. Although I would have liked to use this camera angle, it was just too buggy for my. The camera keeps jumping around and is just too unpredictable which made me feel nauseous.Gameplay:This is a big let down for me. I knew that this was going to be a building game, but at this state there is no gameplay at all. Yes there is multiplayer and some form of enemy AI, but in the end it is just a set of tools that allows the user of this software to create a 3D environment. Therefore, this piece of software should not be promoted as a game when it is just a digital toy.Visuals & audio:This game does look quite good and features a nice art style. The music and audio fit the software well and gives the user an emerging experience.HUD, UI & menu:The menu of the game is clear and easy to understand. The videos in the background look nice and gives a good impression of the features that this software has. The UI and HUD look quite basic and could use some improvements.Multiplayer:I have spent some time on a server, building my little castle in survival mode together with other players it was quite fun.  But again, the lack of gameplay made it boring after a while. I also noticed that there are almost no players on multiplayer, I was expecting servers full of players but in reality there are just about 5 to 10 players playing this online. Overall experience:Building a castle, bridge or other building is fun but becomes boring after a short while. After making some random buildings, a bridge, and some castles I feel bored. The lack of gameplay reduces replayability of this game and does not challenge the player to keep playing. Conclusion:Maybe it is not my type of ""game"", but it was quite a let down for me. The game is hard to get into, then becomes fun but then quickly becomes boring. I hope that I gave enough feedback to improve this game in the future.			"

								Being co-developed at the same time as Space Engineers, one would think the premise would work in medeival times as also, but it just doesn't. Many features are still missing, which is okay because it is still in development, but the real issue is with the interface. It was bad in Space Engineers, but workable. In this, it just doesn't work (at least not with flying turned off.) Building up requires getting pretty creative with scaffolding type parts or jumping between blocks (don't fall off or you will be stuck trying to cobble together some type of stairway.) Once resource requirements are implemented, this is going to be a real issue. Figuring out how all the parts work together is interesting, challenging, and frankly downright frustrating sometimes, again due to the shoddy interface. The game looks beautiful at least.I would love to recommend this title as I really enjoy the idea of being able to build freely, but with the clunky interface and the current lack of working features, I just can't recommend it at this time. Maybe in the future it will be a different story.			"

								Reinstalled this recently was suprised to see it was still in Early Access since I bought in June of 2015, year and half ago, after it had already been on steam for some time.  It was pretty clunky and junky then and not suprisingly it's still clunky and junky.  Early Access is a sham and abused to no end that usually results in abandonware or a ""full release"" that is little more than a demo while the devs move on to other projects.			"

								Most like the desapointment in space engeneers apply here as well, game development is too slow, more than a year and there still nothing to show here but a creative buggy sandbox, on the pace the game is now, in three years you might have something to actually do, but then the specs will be higher and youll need to upgrade to play, this kind of early access is unacceptable, and should not be supported, keen will be in early access for ten years before having a game out, and this one is slower than space engeneers as is not that popular, DON'T BUY UNLESS YOU HAVE A MASSIVE RIG, until this game will be done the specs will be higher than snoop dog, i can't recommend a game from keen software anymore, they don't deliver the game with the specs they sold on early access.There is no actual game in here, only a creative buggy sandbox, that you can buld a house a castle and a catpult.Lumberjack simmulator 2016Q .

No game, no refund and they don't seem to really care.

								Although this game is pretty entertaining, I wouldn't buy it right now. You should wait until the creators add real survival to the game. Right now, survival is just creative, except you can die, can't fly, and can't spawn in bots or use voxel tools. Already, there are griefers in this game. All they have to do is throw a huge stone at your base and it crumbles. You don't even have to build weapons to grief. All you have to do is equip a stone and click to throw. Next, the tools, as of now, are very basic. For some reason, I've been able to mine with an axe. I can still mine with a pickaxe, but how int he world do you mine with an axe?! On a more serious note, the bots are terrible. You'll see barbarians that run to a king's statue, hit it, then run away. Then, they come back a minute later and finish off the statue. Also, miners accidently kill each other while they mine. Since you can't pick up rocks, the stone you get from mining just lags your game. Anyway, that's my sort of negative review. Oh, one last thing. The building mechanic are pretty terrible. I remember building a stone column a few blocks high. Somehow, a wooden platform broke it. How the HECK does wood destroy stone?! You know what's weird? I just talked about a billion negatives and I still recommend the game. Eh, I'm too lazy to write the positives.			"

								Medieval Engineers is a great sandbox voxel-based builder in concept, but still has many issues because it is in early access.  The main places where it falls short are Survival mode and optimization.  The Survival mode has just barely been implemented, and is... well just bad for now, but that will probably be fixed very soon as the devs are pretty active.  But the main thing that bothers me is that most computers can't even run this game yet.  I have a $300 gaming computer with a 6-core processor and 16 gigs of RAM that can run Portal 2 smoothly on max graphics, and I can only run this game at about 5 fps on the lowest settings.  I wish I could rate a ""kind of"" for do you recommend this game.  If you have an amazing computer that can run this game smoothly, then I would definitely say to get Medieval Engineers, but if not I would wait and see if they improve how the game runs first.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has been in ""Early Access"" for an eternity. I bought it early hoping I could support it and make it better, but it's never come even close to being a decent playable game:- Poorly optimized. Crashes often on a pretty good computer, and even when it doesn't crash it's super laggy.- Glitchy. Character often gets stuck at random spots. Even in the pre-set environments, like the pre-loaded castle, there are tons of spots where you just randomly can't move.- Interaction with objects is fairly useless. Again, even in the pre-set environments, the objects like catapults and drawbridges are purely for show.- Gravity is useless. There are no calculations for structural integrity, so you might as well play Minecraft.- Build tools are very rudimentary. Again, even Minecraft has more variety than this, and is a playable game to boot.- Graphics suck. There are no other skins or textures in the base game, much less an ability to choose between them in the same castle. Everything starts to look the same after a while.If you want to design and ""build"" castles, just use Google Sketchup. If you want to play in a fortress of your design, play Minecraft or any of the dozens of other games out there in the same vein. This one just felt like a giant waste of time and money.			"

								This is basically minecraft in permanent creative mode applied to building a sand castle for you to kick down later. You just spawn things in. Eventually Barbarians come and knock it down. You build again elsewhere. In multiplayer you just build something and watch as someone knocks it down. There is nothing alive in the world. You don't mine for resources, harvest trees, nothing. Just you spawning in pre-designed blocks and pieces of a castle to build your own castle. Same map every time, same castle, same design. I just don't get this ""game"". There isn't anything here. The physics is very complex and realistic, and clearly an ernormous volume of work has been put into this. But it isn't a game. It isn't even any sort of sim. There isn't any point to this at all unless you like kicking over sand castles in a permanent ""god mode"" with unlimited everything.This game has been in early access for a long time now, and I do receive updates for it from time to time. However I am yet to see anything change at all in the game. Starting to feel like a dead game that isn't even 10% complete to me, or was it always intended to be nothing else than a very bad ""medieval garry's mod""?			"

								UI, and controls are horrendous. Building has only several tiny redeeming features which aren't worth explaining due to the fact that you will destroy everything if you make a simple mistake. My friend and I couldn't figure out how to play survival.(what's the point though if the game that is made for building stuff sucks at allowing you to build stuff? The game is called Medieval ENGINEERS for ♥♥♥♥ sakes). The game's optimisation is absoloutely below par; framerate drops even on the lowest possible settings (sounds familiar to Space Engineers). I would suggest lowering your expectations of a fairly stable game to absoloutely nothing, and then five times less than that, then you might not be too disappointed. If this game was more user friendly, and rose above more than 20 FPS for atleast 10 minutes it may have been worth the 13 dollars I spent on it while on sale.			"

								I bought this along with space engineers some time ago. My computer couldn't run them at the time, so I held off. Even though I barely made the minimum requirements for SE, it was 5 eye-bleeding-FPS. But now, even with my 8GB RAM and 3.9ghz 6-core, it takes some minimal settings. (so yeah, even a Radeon 6570 can struggle through).Anyway, I've had some time to see it change, and it only gets progressively better. Some people think the recent update is a step backward. Thruthfully, it's a step sideways (little was removed, but a lot of quality-of-living things have been improved).  It's getting there. Give it some time.			"

								Honestly, i was excited when i hear about it, but since its been out, ive been addicted, even with the little content block wise and workshop items, creations are endless, Now we can create any medieval RPG in whatever way we want, for as long and as big as we want. This game is a Masterpiece,.::: July Update :::...... Yup, still as awesome as it was before, it just got even better!.::: September Update :::.I still cant find anything i agree with in this game,i have especially enjoyed some of the little sneak previews the developers, have either intentionally left into the game for us to find, or just by accident, but from these we can see just how much detail is going to get put into the game. So far i have sumbled upon a number of unique player Skins, which include:Female Engineer ModelsChildren Player /NPC Models""Old Man"" Player /NPC ModelAnd new forms of hostile animals to be introduced into the world including the ""Medieval Wolf""Ive found all of these inside the Small chest ingame while using Creative, and after every update i now lov to go and check it out incase there's something new in there which could possibly tell us whats coming next. With previews like this it leaves the door open for more things to be created such as: Plate Armour, Chain-mail. Leather armour, Warhammers, Maces and Fails, it is essentially endless, and with the annoucement of ""Brain AI"" this could protentally become of the most advanced Player NPC Interaction game out there.As for the building, its only got better and more stable as its progressed, and now through their weeks up bugfixing the game is getting even smoother, ive seen this personally with a few friends who wern't able to run the game very well before and now they can. I've even started my own projects such as building a re-creation of the Runescape World across several maps. I can only hope that one day the developers will bring out large maps one day which will allow players to build kingdoms together through continous generation.This is the only review i enjoy updating if im completely honest and i will update it again in the future!

								Honestly, i was excited when i hear about it, but since its been out, ive been addicted, even with the little content block wise and workshop items, creations are endless, Now we can create any medieval RPG in whatever way we want, for as long and as big as we want. This game is a Masterpiece,.::: July Update :::...... Yup, still as awesome as it was before, it just got even better!.::: September Update :::.I still cant find anything i agree with in this game,i have especially enjoyed some of the little sneak previews the developers, have either intentionally left into the game for us to find, or just by accident, but from these we can see just how much detail is going to get put into the game. So far i have sumbled upon a number of unique player Skins, which include:Female Engineer ModelsChildren Player /NPC Models""Old Man"" Player /NPC ModelAnd new forms of hostile animals to be introduced into the world including the ""Medieval Wolf""Ive found all of these inside the Small chest ingame while using Creative, and after every update i now lov to go and check it out incase there's something new in there which could possibly tell us whats coming next. With previews like this it leaves the door open for more things to be created such as: Plate Armour, Chain-mail. Leather armour, Warhammers, Maces and Fails, it is essentially endless, and with the annoucement of ""Brain AI"" this could protentally become of the most advanced Player NPC Interaction game out there.As for the building, its only got better and more stable as its progressed, and now through their weeks up bugfixing the game is getting even smoother, ive seen this personally with a few friends who wern't able to run the game very well before and now they can. I've even started my own projects such as building a re-creation of the Runescape World across several maps. I can only hope that one day the developers will bring out large maps one day which will allow players to build kingdoms together through continous generation.This is the only review i enjoy updating if im completely honest and i will update it again in the future!

								I purchased space engineers had more than the requirements to run the game but was terribly disappointed when i did. Despite having a fairly good system the game itself is a lag monster of epic proportions. Sadly...it found its way into the delete bin. Fast forward to Medieval Engineers. I threw caution to the wind and read all the reviews and figured what the hell give the devs one more try and see if this game fared any better than space engineers. Well to be honest in fact its worse. The game lags terribly even at the lowest setting. The AI is horrific and the game lacks lustre in general. I realize this is early release and i hate to sound so overwhelmingly negative but in my humble opinion i really think the devs need to get into a different line of work. It seems like the only thing theyre concentrating on is your dollar. One more title for the delete bin.			"

								This game is everything I wanted from 'Minecraft' but couldn't get.  At the moment I'm engaged in the Castle building rather than the machine construction.  I can see the potential for future pieces and blocks - and once the modding community gets going the buildings will be fabulous (rather than just great).The placing of blocks can be a struggle sometimes and even with update .008 the lighting is a real pain.  It's as if the devs are trying to be too clever by putting in day/night, sun position etc before fixing the awful shadow problems.  The interior lighting still needs a lot of work.However, it is still early access and apart from the lighting problems this game is well on the way to getting 5 stars and being my favourite.			"

Early Access Review
								Owned Space Engineers and played it for quite a bit and so far I like what I see in Medieval Engineers. It has several useful mechanics that we will hopefully see implemented into Space Engineers but also has a few things that need to be addressed, that one would of thought wouldn't be a problem.Let's start off simple:Medieval Engineers is a branch off of Space Engineers developed by an entirely seperate team within the same studio so that both games can continue to grow and be improved without splitting the time and effort between one game or the other. This is an exceptionally good thing because it means we won't have to deal with prolonged update times or glitches having to be put on hold as they alternate. Another good thing from this is that as one development team comes up with a great concept within their own, it will then eventually be transplanted into the other essentially improving both games at the same time, a double bonus for us who own both.I enjoy the fact it is a lot easier to place blocks within the same tile now so that you can easily fix wall placement and/or fortifications that would otherwise have some very weird looking repairs/modifications to themselves and it also allows you to merge blocks that would normally not have been placed together to create even more interesting designs. Since this game released roughly a little over a month ago now, it is already impressive.The implementation of the structural integrity build adds much to the ""Engineering"" aspect of this game which many had claimed had been missing from Space Engineers. Sure we get to build things, but they aren't always sound nor well thought out and now we're forced to do both. We experiment and build a design and then when it falls apart, we take it apart and see what went wrong so we can fix it or build it even better the next time. When it comes to designing structures and defenses, this is a great mechanic at seeing what is already weak and needs to be reinforced instead of having to destroy it first. However, this mechanic is still very much a prototype of the final feature. There are bugs with this and as it is only in Alpha Stage so far even with the public release. Where one time it can function properly, other times things will fall apart even when they're sound. It can be annoying but then this is an Alpha, don't expect everything to be working properly.Many people complain the price of the game at $19.99 or $14.99 USD for those who already own Space Engineers is a bit much. For those just coming in, I can see why you would think that as there have been many cash grabs in the past but these developers have already been around for over a year with Space Engineers and it has come a remarkably long way. With the quality, care, and dedication they've put in their other version, I would easily pay more for this kind of game even though it's far from release because they keep re-polishing it, the workshop is a major source of custom mods and/or net-code UI, and better yet, it fits my favorite time frame of the Medieval Period in general.Multiplayer hasn't been fully implemented yet but then in Space Engineers, it took over four months for that to come out and when it did, it was working with very few bugs and overall was very enjoyable. It gave people time to experiment and plan ahead on what worked and what didn't so that way when you and your friends decide to have a battle-royale, you could make it work the way you imagined it (maybe, depends on your creativity).Overall, with just a few minutes of gameplay experimenting with the new features, I can safely say that this game has brought several much needed changes to the table and can only get better from here on out. (Knock on wood, don't want to jinx the unimaginable happening).Overall Score: 9.1/10The game is in Alpha mode so I respect that there are still some bugs/features that don't work properly but overall, the game has a steady framerate, the destruction engine doesn't lag as much as it used to, better building interface and UI, somewhat functioning AI which is a great hint at what is to come.For those of you who don't already own it, I suggest also getting Space Engineers. For tips, help, and general improvements to those starting out, try watching some videoes from LastStandGamers. They're a tremendous help to the community and also take out shoutouts for things people want to try but can't build on their own yet.https://www.youtube.com/user/LastStandGamers "

								Very good game with A LOT of potential not only for its own development but a great start to getting planets in Space Engineers. Keep it up KEEN Software! This game is worth every penny!One more thing.... Please add a day and night cycle and maybe some more graphic settings to make the game run a little smoother on weaker machines, i have a powerful computer but even I get a decent amount of VLag. We needs to be nice to the toddler machines now!			"

								I bought this as soon as it was released into SEA. At the beginning there wasnt much to it, but now a meagre ten weeks into public development we have seen all sorts of AIs added and a near doubling of building blocks. And the destruction physics never get old. 10/10 would watch castle collapse again			"

								This game is everything I wanted from 'Minecraft' but couldn't get.  At the moment I'm engaged in the Castle building rather than the machine construction.  I can see the potential for future pieces and blocks - and once the modding community gets going the buildings will be fabulous (rather than just great).The placing of blocks can be a struggle sometimes and even with update .008 the lighting is a real pain.  It's as if the devs are trying to be too clever by putting in day/night, sun position etc before fixing the awful shadow problems.  The interior lighting still needs a lot of work.However, it is still early access and apart from the lighting problems this game is well on the way to getting 5 stars and being my favourite.			"

								If you loved early Space Engineers and any interest in castles this will rock your world. As of this review it is only creative and the structure intergity has a habit of breaking things with little reason as to why. This is the story of Early Access. But the developers have more than proven themselves with Space Engineers and contiune to. In months multiplayer will be in and you and your friends can build and break castles. Survival is also in the works. I would defintiely recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
								Owned Space Engineers and played it for quite a bit and so far I like what I see in Medieval Engineers. It has several useful mechanics that we will hopefully see implemented into Space Engineers but also has a few things that need to be addressed, that one would of thought wouldn't be a problem.Let's start off simple:Medieval Engineers is a branch off of Space Engineers developed by an entirely seperate team within the same studio so that both games can continue to grow and be improved without splitting the time and effort between one game or the other. This is an exceptionally good thing because it means we won't have to deal with prolonged update times or glitches having to be put on hold as they alternate. Another good thing from this is that as one development team comes up with a great concept within their own, it will then eventually be transplanted into the other essentially improving both games at the same time, a double bonus for us who own both.I enjoy the fact it is a lot easier to place blocks within the same tile now so that you can easily fix wall placement and/or fortifications that would otherwise have some very weird looking repairs/modifications to themselves and it also allows you to merge blocks that would normally not have been placed together to create even more interesting designs. Since this game released roughly a little over a month ago now, it is already impressive.The implementation of the structural integrity build adds much to the ""Engineering"" aspect of this game which many had claimed had been missing from Space Engineers. Sure we get to build things, but they aren't always sound nor well thought out and now we're forced to do both. We experiment and build a design and then when it falls apart, we take it apart and see what went wrong so we can fix it or build it even better the next time. When it comes to designing structures and defenses, this is a great mechanic at seeing what is already weak and needs to be reinforced instead of having to destroy it first. However, this mechanic is still very much a prototype of the final feature. There are bugs with this and as it is only in Alpha Stage so far even with the public release. Where one time it can function properly, other times things will fall apart even when they're sound. It can be annoying but then this is an Alpha, don't expect everything to be working properly.Many people complain the price of the game at $19.99 or $14.99 USD for those who already own Space Engineers is a bit much. For those just coming in, I can see why you would think that as there have been many cash grabs in the past but these developers have already been around for over a year with Space Engineers and it has come a remarkably long way. With the quality, care, and dedication they've put in their other version, I would easily pay more for this kind of game even though it's far from release because they keep re-polishing it, the workshop is a major source of custom mods and/or net-code UI, and better yet, it fits my favorite time frame of the Medieval Period in general.Multiplayer hasn't been fully implemented yet but then in Space Engineers, it took over four months for that to come out and when it did, it was working with very few bugs and overall was very enjoyable. It gave people time to experiment and plan ahead on what worked and what didn't so that way when you and your friends decide to have a battle-royale, you could make it work the way you imagined it (maybe, depends on your creativity).Overall, with just a few minutes of gameplay experimenting with the new features, I can safely say that this game has brought several much needed changes to the table and can only get better from here on out. (Knock on wood, don't want to jinx the unimaginable happening).Overall Score: 9.1/10The game is in Alpha mode so I respect that there are still some bugs/features that don't work properly but overall, the game has a steady framerate, the destruction engine doesn't lag as much as it used to, better building interface and UI, somewhat functioning AI which is a great hint at what is to come.For those of you who don't already own it, I suggest also getting Space Engineers. For tips, help, and general improvements to those starting out, try watching some videoes from LastStandGamers. They're a tremendous help to the community and also take out shoutouts for things people want to try but can't build on their own yet.https://www.youtube.com/user/LastStandGamers "

								Can't recommend this yet.  It's a buggy mess of a survival game. Your tools don't hit what you're aiming at most of the time, the physics bugs out resulting in hillarious is annoying deaths, your AI helpers are worse than useless, and the only alternative to them is doing it all yourself which turns this into a carrying stuff simulator.  It's a decent idea, and might be a good foundation for a game SOMEDAY, but not yet.  Too many bugs, and too many bad design decisions.  Maybe give it a follow, and see if it gets batter later.			"

If you like building, you should buy this game. Its a very good game, its in early access now, but ofcourse it is, its pretty new. Moving sometimes is a little bit buggy. And one thing! There is those doors. Without doors! Now, in the early access,(or alpha) i would give it atleast 8/10. If you developers continue like the same way, its gonna be 10/10!!			"

								Any game Keen software makes will be amazing! They are probably the most impresive indie company i ever bought i game off. As most people know there is also a space engineers (which is bloody amazing and i prefer). Both games are great and have their own challenges and fun parts. Medevil engineers is rather new so don't get upset when you buy the game and there are a couple bugs. In medevil engineers there is creative, survival and castle seige. Creative is where you are emortal and have unlimited recources and basicly you can do what ever the heck you want....well if you take of structural intregrity, Survival (which i haven't done much of) is probably the toughest out of all the survival games i've done you have limited recources everything is done by hand you can die of starvation and you have to fight of barbarians (cpu's) and sometimes other players who want your loot. Castle seige is one of Keens newest addition to the game, in castle seige you have to defend or attack of course defender have to build the most impinatrable for imaginable to prevent the attacker(s) from destroying the statue and there are no cpu's to help you,its all donne by you and your buddies. Castle seige is a bit of a chalenge to start off because not manny players join castle seige servers unless you have more then 3 buddies with you anything under is just boring.Even though I have not spent as much time on this game i would recomend it to extreme builders, competitive players, and of course space engineer players.

								This is undoubtedly a good and original game. However, my computer (hp250) tends to throw a wobbly over shadows and trees. At the time of writing there is no obvious option to remove shadows so my lag has gone through the roof and the game tends to crash every 5 minutes of so. I hope that future updates will include options for unlimited video memory and removed shadows.			"

								How to say...I love Space, and medieval engineers. But they ♥♥♥♥ed up this game and ruined the building possibilities with an update, before you could use (alt key) to put blocks together (going throught each others) and you can't anymore..That means, the roofs can not be build anymore, and you can't make corners with wall facing specific directio, etc etc...In my point of view, that ruined the game, if they would bring back it it would be awesome game, but till then, it is non senseedit: the alt key is still removed, but they added with "" z"" doesnt work with every blocks like before, but its stilla step forward :)			"

								The game has a lot of potential but i couldnt really enjoy it. Its not user friendly (lol) i had a hard time remembering what did what to get it to snap and it was more frustrating playing then fun for me. Maybe if they idk how but fix that i would consider playing it more.  Like i said the game has a lot of potential to go far but could definatly be tweaked to make for a more fun ""Medieval"" Game play experience.  I know its still relitively new but like i said it was mostly just frustrating for me than fun. I know there are a lot of people who have played it and fallen in love with it. This is just my personal experience and opinion of the game.  Once you get the hang of what you're doing its not so bad, but it felt more of a chore because there was just so much going on and so much i had to do to place down a simple block that it just wasnt enjoyable for me. Which is disapointing because i was really excited to play. It reminded me of a medieval minecraft and unfortunately i went into it expecting it to be similar to minecraft in that way and it just really wasnt. Which might be why I had such a difficult time. There were a lot of things in the game that were very janky, and just couldnt be done no matter how much i pressed E R T Y.  I would have to say that i didnt care much for it but i do recomend it because its the type of game you have to play yourself to see if you enjoy it.			"

								Love the physics in the game even though it ♥♥♥♥s you over some times. But this game really needs improvments. Survival for example, not much going on there but go creative and have a blast building a balanced castle and then destroy it.On the building point of view, yes the physics are real but if you, let's say bulidng a tower, and you're about to finish it and SOMEHOW you drop a stoneblock on the floor where it stands your entire castle collaps (yes it happened me that's why i only have 4 hours on record..)But other than that i'm going to recomend this BUT only if you're into a game with great building physics and you're really creative!

								Chopped down a tree,Tree fell and squished me.I spawn picking up logs,Made a house.Got more wood, tree fell on me again.Captures logs as prisonors for future use.Defently will get squashed by tree again.Ok seriously now. People are reviewing this as if its a full release which its an Early Release so yes theres a few bugs and glitches which does not break the game apart from the one time  I fell through the world which never happened again and was fixed with a quick load.When I started I decided to go into creative and build to see what happens when I go from being releastic to unreleastic to see how far I can go until physicics come into place, once I understood how that works in this game I went into survival.Survival is very basic for now. Health Bar, Food Bar and Stamina bar. You start with a tempary cart which despawns when you leave the game but  you can use the parts and keep them. It has basic parts like a bed weapons, tools and other items.  I chopped down trees, found out what I needed to build the foundation of my house, slowly i was building walls, floors and a roof.   It took me a while to learn what type of wood I need but in no time I have a roof over my head.I was able to cook on a campfire for food, hunt Deer and pick mushrooms.  But only having a game play of 9,1hours from writing this I do see potential and I am looking forward for updates towards survival.My pc is a mid range, new pc from 2009, updated motherboard and Graphics only.Pros: Lovely sceneary         The ablilty to go online with friends and play.          Survival mode           Watching a tree create a dominos effect. (I crushed my house once)           Creative mode            Able to build anything you can think of            Watching things crumble is amazing.           Simple controls and Space Engineers (same company i know) will be fine with  them.           able to hunt animals and attack defend from barberians.Cons: Not enough wild aniamls.          smaller trees sometimes flick out and kills you for no reason but fix to be done.          Not enough friendly NPCs or villages apart from what you make or a world you spawn that has them. "

								I have not played this game a whole lot but i really like the way they are going. I see a lot of role play possibilities with the kingdom mechanic. I think the crafting is well made and its not overly complicated, i do however would prefer a more minecraft ish crafting mechanic and display, kind of feels like there are a few more steps then needed to craft. They have been doing a great job with implementing the voxels to fit together.Would love to see water (Rivers, Lakes and Oceans) and fishing, with a in depth mechanic to farming. Would also like to eventually see pre made towns with AI's wandering around doing their daily things etc.I would recommend this game to others, it has a lot in it considering they have been putting a lot of time into Space Engineers. Even more fun to play with friends.			"

								The System Requirements are insanely high (significantly higher than even GTA 5) and are deliberately not highlighted before you actually purchase the game. Check http://www.medievalengineers.com/system-requirements.html to ensure you can actually run the game before buying it. If you don't meet the minimum requirements the game will give you an error message and refuse to launch. TLDR: GFX cards > 1 year old will struggle, > 2 years won't launch at all.I was able to run Space Engineers (which imo is a better looking game too) on full settings with no problems whatsoever.Checking the forums shows other people having similar issues as well as endless stability issues.Far and away the least finished early access game I've ever seen - they clearly released after a couple of months just to cash in on the early money off the back of some fairly promising looking trailers.STEER WELL CLEAR.

***DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU'RE ON WINDOWS 10 AND HAVE AN NVIDIA BASED GRAPHICS CARD.***I would love to write a positive review of this game... But I can't. I wouldn't be posting a technical issue as a poor review, BUT this particular bug has been around for over a month at least, and the work around involving Windows 10 and nVidia graphics card drivers (that's not really posted or documented well) is to DOWNGRADE your drivers to a specific range. This bug does not affect the game's sister product, Space Engineers, so I'm scratching my head at this one.I will change this review IF AND WHEN they address the graphics problems for nVidia cards.

								With survival and multiplayer released and after 3 months of further development - is it worth buying now?Graphics:The graphics are quite good for being made from scratch and the optimisation is better than expected. The physics/destructible blocks are well done, only from time to time they behave rather wonky. All in all a visually pleasing experience.Audio:The music of the game is really fantastic and underlines the medieval setting. Other sounds often don't work or are not appropiate - may be placeholders though?!Gameplay:The construction system brings some needed innovation with it and mostly works better than it's space counterpart (Space Engineers). Those blocks that are available are nicely done, however there are so few of them even months after release.Content:Multiplayer seems to be the same as in Space Engineers and fulfills it's purpose. Survival however is nothing more than Creative without flying and god-mode - I really don't understand why they didn't copy the code from Space Engineers so the players at least have an inventory and can gather resources. (It seems an inventory system will be introduced later on, logs/stones have to be transported manually)To sum it up:After 3 months with a (for an early access) big development team one would think that many of the flaws that plagued the release version would have been fixed by now. Unfortunately the game is still glorified lego without much content. This is why I can't recommend buying the game in it's current state especially with this price tag.P.S. Just compare it to minecraft alpha which could be bought for less than 10€ and had much more content (finished suvival/creative/multiplayer and extensive crafting/inventory system)			"

								This really isn't a game....Putting a piece of software available to purchase in the state this game is in, is just wrong.I'm a professional developer of 20+ years and there just ins't any excuse for this.OK, so you can build stuff...  beyond that though, that's it.I've played quite a few ""early access"" games, which all of had actual ""content"" to them upon inital release.  THis game doesn't.Pros.- You can build pretty cool looking stuff.- There are barbarians.Cons.- Building is quite frustrating as the snapping is very bad.  Takes a LOT of very steady mouse movement.- Terrian editing needs a LOT of work.  A LOT!- Barbarians don't seem to do anything but run around sideways and backwards.Not worth trying to mention all this game has or doesn't as it only has like 1 or 2 features.  Besides, most people are just going to flag this thumbs down - not helpful.Here's the helpful part of this review.  If you like Minecraft, you will probably like this game... Don't expect more from this than to build stuff, and knock it down, and start over.  If you're good with this, this might give you entertainment.I would like, and recommend this game if the building was more intuative.  But as it stands, it needs a LOT of work, which means, the game is too early to release and ask for $$$$.If the game interests you, flag it as watching and come back in 6 months.  I do not recomment spending money on this right now.It has a lot of potential...  just none of it has been implemented - yet.			"

Early Access Review
								2016 EDIT BELOWI bought this game under the assumption that all of the features in the announcement video would be taken care of in a month or two after launch. These features are still missing as the game has a constant flow of small updates that are generally useless towards gameplay.If you wanted this game to build medieval contraptions, with and without the mechanical blocks shown in the announcement video, don't buy this. Wait eight or nine months until the game is actually updated with these features so there are things to do.The current contraptions you can build without mechanical blocks are usually buggy/broken and tend to explode and collide for no reason. The devs generally base the updates around what a certain SE/ME community that I won't name, but honestly it's pretty sad because this game could have been a lot better at this stage if the devs actually based updates around core gameplay, but instead they don't even mention the issues people have with the game.Space Engineers is great (Slightly lacking singleplayer content aside) and I would 100% recommend buying it, but please: don't buy Medieval Engineers. I regret purchasing my pre-release version a lot.EDIT-------------------------Its now february 2016, not one set of blocks, mechanical or otherwise has been added to the game since my original review. The developers have completely decided to ignore the mechanical aspects of this game shown in trailer and to early reviewers. The devs have done virtually nothing in the past 10 months to add to this game, and despite showing us the game's ""Roadmap"" not a single thing from even it has been implemented into the game. The weekly updates are a literal joke, and keen seems to have diverted very very little resources to this game despite them saying the contrary.Supposedly survival is being worked on right now, but the game undoubtedly seems to be in development hell. Survival will have no purpose when there aren't any other finished features in the game. The dev's working on this have started work on multiple core features and completely abandoned them after a single update.This game is a huge dissapointment, it's horribly misadvertised and I think KSH should be ashamed to falsely represent a game like this, whilst at the same time lying about development progress expectations.Please don't buy this game.

								This game is GOOD but i have no i ♥♥♥♥ing dear what the developers are thinking and because of that i give this game a NO (for now because of the following).This game is literally unplayable due to the lag... I can't believe someone would even release a game that is as laggy as this is, i have never experienced so much lag in my life. Before people start pointing the finger at my computer or internet ill stop you right there, it is not my internet or computer so delete that from your equation.If anything on the map is destroyed by a catapult or one of the many griefers decide to throw cannon balls at your creation you wont be able to build for around 5 minutes due to the fragmented destruction of objects...If you build a catapult and winch the shaft back with a rope connected to the rope drum DO NOT BUILD A SINGLE THING ON THAT CATAPULT WHILST IT IS CONNECTED TO THE ROPE DRUM!! The entire catapult will explode even if you build one 1x1 piece of wood onto it.... this is extremely frustrating and once again i have no idea what the hell the developers are doing not fixing that... When using a hook on the end of the catapult shaft to launch cannon balls you cant change the angle that much of where you want the cannon ball to be thrown. If you angle it too far left or right the ball just doesn't release and ends up swinging out of control on the end of the shaft then after 10 seconds the cannon ball releases off the hook and then lands on your catapult more than likely destroying it.. so stupid..The stone objects crumble too easily.. take out the front of a castle and the entire thing will collapse because the stability is extremely broken in this game.GRIEFERS oh my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥god!! This game is just full of people who run up to what ever you are making and just decide to destroy it for no reason.. it is literally impossible to make anything that lasts longer than 5 minutes. That's why you see people building on the side of mountains high up to get away from these♥♥♥♥♥♥♥moronic people. Takes 1 swing of a hammer to destroy anything... and soon as you destroy 1 piece of anything it fks the entire object up..What i want to see fixed are the following.-Anti grief-Fall damage is way too sensitive..-Fix the god damn unplayable lag-Fix stability-Make a vote kick system-Fix the voxel (think they are called voxel?) objects, they are an absolute mess (the textures)-Fix ropes-Fix the rope drum sensitivity when winding it up or down, trying to turn a catapult on a rotor to position the aim is     impossible due to the sensitivity of the pull-Fix building on a catapult that is loaded and ready to fire (explodes/breaks)-Fix the release options of hooks used to swing cannon balls (pressing K brings up this menu)-Fix wheels-Fix the strength of stone objects-Fix the strength of melee weapons-Make more creative type servers-Take away the option to be able to throw cannon balls at 100kmph at peoples bases in creative.. seriously wtf..-You should only be able to destroy someone base if the projectile comes from a catapult or something that has thrown   the projectile.. not your friggin hands-Once again, the unplayable lag needs to be fixed..

								Yes, you can make pretty functional machinery with wood and rope and throw stones out of view.The whole movement system is really bad, within 30 minutes of playing I get so fed up with the mouse look / movement action and not to mention the tiny rope connect points. The default siege scenario castles are poorly put together and cramped. A pit in the middle with a walk the plank escape route is hardly a feature one likes to contend with while attempting to strafe around an over sized battlement catapult to attach a rope simply because the range is just to far from my player. The Devs need to tune in the realism at a later date when the rest of the game is more functional. For now it's too cumbersome to have any fun. Don't buy it just yet. KHS should suspend the AI project and keep the cash flow pouring into SE and ME as the weekly updates are not what people are requesting and seem to be predetermined and bottle-necked.This game does have great scope and I hope a real future. We should all be a little more patient when it comes to good things :)			"

What do you expect from such a complex system? Do you want more bugs from unfinished stuff?

I never got to play the game so i have no clue what the game is like and I wish steam would notify you of not having or meeting a certain requirements to run the game or software:(.                              I do recommend the game but i give a thumbs down to steam:(.			"

								This is a great game hands down, they release new content every week, I have not experienced any bugs what so ever in any of my maps. The building integrity is realistic so you can't build stupidly high building you actually have to think when build like in the real world. ( ONLY GET THIS GAME IF YOU LIKE TO MAKE YOUR OWN LITTLE TOWNS AND CASTLES IN IT'S CURRENT STATE.) If you just want to PvP with your friends don't get this game yet because it does'nt have it yet so wait a little before you buy it.			"

								(Early Early access review day that is was released)If I could only buy games form one dev company for the rest of my life it would be keen softwhere.There belief is that you make a game with a basic concept, release it, and let the community decide how they want the game to turn out.  You think that it would turn into a teletubbie rave but you are wrong. They stay in character you could say.  By giving the community what they want but also keeping it form going off track. pros - THEY LISTEN TO THERE FANBACE. Keen Softwhere -""FANBACE IS LOVE FANBACE IS LIFE!!!""        - The game is focused on creatively.        - They keep the game style in medieval times. No BS like flame shooting out of rocks for defense.        - They day it was released I played 2 and 1/2 hrs and i only found one glitch. And i bet my the time you are reading          this they have already fixed it.(Early Early access review day that is was release)cons - They are some performance issues that need fixed. (But I am sure that they will have them fixed within two weeks.)         - There aren't many items.(LIKE I SAID BEFORE THEY WANT THE COMUNITY TO DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT IN THE GAME) So technically this could be a pro.10/10 would play agaSHUT UP WILL YOU IT IS GETING OLD!!!!

								Its gotten a lot of hate lately, and I can understand why. Survival is unplayable at the moment, the physics are a bit buggy, playing online is buggy as all hell, and the progress is very slow. I would call it a reskin of space engineers though, I kinda like the controls on this game a bit more than space engineers, and think they could do well from some more similarities in building controls. All I ever really do is build♥♥♥♥♥♥and ♥♥♥♥ around, I've even made a car powered by gears and the handle wheel thingy. It does need much improvement, and its demanding in pc specs for some, but I'd say for people who like building, its a good buy when on sale.			"

 Pretty fun game with nice destruction  I decided to completely re-""write"" my last so-called ""review"" since it sucked, but this one does to so to be honest I don't really see the point. This game is pretty enjoyable. The music is good, the building is interesting and I like the ability to kinda merge blocks. It does also feel pretty good to destroy castles, even though the destruction isn't flawless: sometimes block gets stuck in the air, but for the most part it works fine.			"

								Game mechanics are poor, the physics are good, but there is no resource collecting, no real engineering, and everything is already pre-built. In addition to this, unless you are on a closed one person server, people come in with unlimited cannonballs and launch them at you and your work. What is the point on having to build a catapult, when you have unlimited cannonballs in your inventory?			"

								 I just bought this a half hour ago. I went to climb a hill after 2 minutes of play time and just pleasantly floated above terrain till I was above atmosphere. Then I tuned into a special message from god saying i must be carfull not to save my life - errr rather game I mean, lol.  Apparently I ended up in a developer mode somehow. Interesting but I'll have to refund it if I just float around all over game universe. Might have been a good game if they fix this or don't auto throw you into dev. mode.			"

								This game barely got my Yes vote, on the sole realization that it is still Early Access. I plan to re-review it whenever the quirks I note are fixed.This game has a nice building system that is held back from an awful physics system. You can build a vehicle out of a thousand pounds of material, and accidentally walk into it to send it flying across the field. This was an awkward system that we didn't see in space engineers.Creation of true siege equipment like battering rams and trebuchets are limited to only being visually appealing, rather than actually functional. Even with ""tearable rope"", trebuchets are wonky, at best. Battering rams filled with steel ""weights"" can't bust through a single layer of timber (But remember, your average-sized body can toss the battering ram across the field, if it has wheels)This game has a lot of potential, but right now, it really can't harness my creative mind nearly as well as space engineers, and with good reason, space engineers has had much longer to develop. I hope developers will address the wonky physics system in future updates.			"

								THIS GAME WILL NOT RUN AT ALL ON INTEL GRAPHICS. Even if you technically meet the requirements, this game simply will not run with Intel integrated graphics. It won't even start. Many people have reported the same problem online. I have never had the problem with any other game, and meet all of the requirements, but since I don't have a stand-alone graphics card I can't play the game. I am extremely dissapointed that the need for a stand-alone graphics card was not listed in the minimum requirements.			"

								Ok great physics here and the building felt smooth, but after that I can't say much.  If you just want to build stuff like legos meets computer age then this is for you.  After that I just found it boring like a concept without a game.  I might give it a try later but I struggled to be entertained for the 30minutes I played.Sorry just not my game but the concept is a great one. 6.5/10Good work here, but it feels purposeless at the moment other than to check out the physics progress.

								This game has a great deal of potential.   However, at this time I cannot recommend buying it.  In a year or two it's probably gong to be great, but I'm looking for a game I can play NOW.  I love Space Engineers and have almost 600 hours on it, but I bought it after it was 18 to 24 months into development and the survival mode was actually playable.  At this time survival mode is really just Creative mode with a different label.  You still place an infinite number of blocks without needing any materials and there are no recipes to craft any of the blocks yet, even if you have materials.  I really wish I had been able to tell this before buying it, but real hard information on gameplay is hard to come by. As I said, in a year or two this might be a fantastic game, but for right now it's just a 3d building/modeling program, not really a game.			"

								So a long- long time ago it was a very cute little game about castle building - I've spent a good total of over 100 hours tinkering with keeps ,sities and mines, and it was a lot of fun although it was lacking a lot of parts and wasn't spacialy big ,but now the game is entirely new - giant world's , a work- in -progress RPG system (R.I.P. castle siege ,didn't need you anyway) and most importantly - that feeling of Terra-nova that space engienrs acomplished in 2015. It truly feels like a building adventure in an epic medival world .But its still not done - lags are common, bots are dumb ( there isn't much to begin with honedstly) and ther is a lot missing in terms of bloks and aother bulding do-dads. BUt honestly - it's already great , so why not to play it?			"

								Ok, it is never easy to write a good Early Access Review. The basic rule is to review the game features. not the bugs, because these should be squashed sometime during the alpha and beta test phase. but Ok here we go.The game has a sandbox and a survival mode. in sandbox, it is basically build for free, your character can fly, great for the creative mind and for learning the basic mechanics of the game.In survial mode, your character needs to eat to stay alive. food can be found in the form of berries, muchrooms and you can hunt game for a nice chop of deer meat. Jummie.Besides starvation, the other ways of dying are being crushed by a falling tree or any other heavy object, killed by other players or AI (PvPvE). There is an option to play off-line and without barbarian bits as well if you don't like that aspect.To build your castle in survival is a very rewarding but time consuming process. for example a single foundation block takes 20 stone and 10 wood chips to build. you can carry 10 wood chips fine, but only 1 stone. It would take for ever to build a castle without some form of transport.This is where the engineering bit really comes to life. I started really enjoying the game after building my first cart that is pulled up the hill using a drum and rope. after chopping down some trees or gathering stone in the quarry, I simply fill the boxes on my cart, go back to the scaffolding site and haul the cart in with the rope spindle.If you are up to being clever enough to build things like this, or cranes or other medieval construction mechanics, this game is for you!Also, every now and then save your game under a different name. build a Trebuchet or catapult and demolish your work. Big fun, then load your backup save game and continue building. Remarks: Make sure you have a decent computer! my I7 laptop with GeForce GT 630M can barely run the game. Also I had to downgrade my graphics drivers to Nvidia driver version 355.98 because of a lightning error that occurs with later drivers. Performance improvements are normally done in a later development phase, but until than the game has heavy physics and graphics demands.Another thing is the learning curve. There are many tutorials on the web, but due to the many updates these are out of date quickly and some times they are not representing the latest version of the game any more. It often takes a lot of efford and asking on the forums how a new feature works. Again, tutorials and hints are normally implemented in the final stages of game development.For an early acces game, It is at the moment already very playable en enjoyable and it has all the potential to become a great game once finished. Therefore the game has my recommendation!			"

								The rule is easy: if you're not into medieval castles and simple (but creative as hell) engineering, this game isn't for you.But if you like to build castles, houses, towns, in for purpose minecraft, but never destroyed them with projectiles and a self-made catapult and felt ashamed of it, you want this game.If you like building stuff on survival with fair difficulity, you want this game.If you love medieval era, you want this game.Want a trebuchet? Balista? Siege tower? You can make it in this game. And experience the glorious and often funny bugs with physics when shooting a deer.Like engineering gates, moving bridges, whole clock mechanisms? - you want to play this game.Ever wanted to make a stronghold block-by-block? You want this game.Loved the stronghold series? You want this game.If you just like building things, you want this game.Game works pretty good, but it's obvious that with a 2500+ blocks it wont run fast and smooth.Loved space engineers, but want a more ""traditional"" experience? Play it. It's great.			"

								With the understanding that it's early access (I dislike how often the steam community needs to be reminded of this), I certainly recommend this game.  The physics and destruction technologies are astounding, and worth the price just by themselves in my opinion.That being said, I usually spend most of my time building contraptions or weapons, and less frequently have I engaged in survival gameplay or multiplayer.  Survival does not yet feel finished, but I think it's headed in the right direction.  The multiplayer that I have engaged in doesn't seem to have any glaring problems.But I feel that where this game really shines is when you come up with some crazy new idea for a weapon or portcullis or something, build it, and it actually WORKS more or less like you expect it to.  That's rare for a physics engine.I built an extendible bridge the other day that opens with a scissor-like motion, all just by turning a crank.  And it actually worked!  I've read some complaints that it's hard to put stuff together, so I guess there might be a learning curve.  Personally, I thought it was pretty intuitive and well designed.  The controls to rotate blocks could be better, though.As far as performance issues go, I have a $1500 rig, which I feel is a sort of upper-middle-range price (not ludicrous, certainly).  I play on pretty much maxed-out settings at 2560x1440 and I don't usually see the fps drop below 80.  It hasn't been a problem for me.  I agree that it isn't very optimized yet, though, so if you've got an older or budget build at the moment then the time might not be right to buy.  Also, my build is Intel/Nvidia based, and I don't know how much that affects this game (there was some question about that in other reviews).Anyway, building contraptions (not to mention castles) makes me happy, so if you're anything like me, you ought to like this game.  And I'm very impressed with what they've accomplished with Space Engineers, so I'm pretty excited about what Medieval Engineers will become.  It's kept up a pretty good development pace so far.TL;DR:Survival and other aspects are unfinished, but the physics-based engineering/inventing dynamic even just in creative mode makes this game worth the price. [LAST REMINDER - THIS GAME IS EARLY ACCESS]			"

								This game should have armor and much more weapons and a way where you can reinforce your seige weapons by covering the wood with metal plates so it will last longer in battle and more metal like copper, silver and more please.

								Building castles has never been so fun.Being an Early Access game you should expect bugs,getting killed by your first cart(maybe) and dying of starvation because you're just too busy building. Overall I love it and even tho some poeple complained about the newer research system, i actually loved it, gives the game more of a survival feeling.P.s. It's best played with friends.			"

								Another update to my age old review of this game.Basically still too early to play, but it has some carthardic value in destroying everything you see with high velocity stone.Survival is impelemented, if a tad poorly.Crafting is implemented, if a tad poorly.Voxel manipulation is here, just like SE.Play SE until ME is finished.Seriously though. ^On the flip side, if you like the idea of watching castles come down after firing heavy rocks, then by all means, go ham while.

								MUCH GOOD PHYSICS!PEACHY LIKES! PEACHY WILL KILL DEVELOPERS LAST!But seriously, this game is great, it's almost like these games are getting better and better.Mincraft had a great creative aspect, but in terms of the games engine physics, it was unrealistic and hard to work with.7DaystoDie had the physics but it was dull, everything seems greyish, While still a great game, it lacked ""Muchness""And now MedEngin has come along and has given us a bright, beutiful, manupulative work, and while limited in creativity (It is in alpha to be fair :D) What other games lets you throw cannonball like things at forts. You can literally have a Castle War.Not only do I recomment this game, I suggest it, I ship it and I s....ssssseriously love it? I guess.I cannot wait for multiplayer.Seriously. Bring it out now.

								I only picked it up because it'll be $5 more in 2 weeksEdit: To the people who didn't find it helpful, it's going to be a great game when it fully gets there. I wrote this as a kind of satire review because the game state is playable, just varying degrees of being enjoyable. I guarantee that in the 2 weeks that the 25% sale lasts, there will be the 2 weekly updates that will patch many of the existing bugs and add in just a bit more content so it's not as dry as the very early release.TL:DR Whether Medieval Engineers is better in 2 weekly updates during the sale, it's worth the investment...so you can throw your money at Naval Engineers if that ever comes out			"

								I bought this game a year ago and thought ""Hey this looks cool! Biweekly updates means it will be a hundred times better after a year!"" Hell no. I stopped playing a year ago because it was terribly optimised and I could barely run it on a good computer. And let’s say even if I had a bad computer in a year it should have run the same if not better right? Again Hell No! I opened it up and it was VERY laggy and worse than before. I loaded a world for 10 minutes and then when I got in it would lag and freeze at the lowest settings! Then the screen turned white and I could do nothing. To stop this I had to shut down my computer... Twice, I tried twice and the second time it turned white from the get go. So even biweekly updates could not save this game because it is more of a wreck then when I bought it a year ago. Maybe in another year it might be ok. And also the building is insanely difficult and unless you have a degree in architecture or physics never expect to make a catapult or castle its way to hard and requires lots of knowledge that is too complex for a simple game to require, I could not make a castle with catapults and a nice design if I actually played for that year!

								I was debating whether or not to get this game, I wanted fun combat and cool building, kinda like Ark Survival Evolved or Stranded Deep, this game has one of the best building systems I've seen and I'm glad I purchased it. I haven't seen an combat yet because I have only played for a couple hours, but I'm loving it! I DEFINETELY RECOMMEND!!!!!!! :)			"

								the game currently is very spesific in the kind of players it pleases at the current build. Assuming they keep the course (They have a decent track record to suggest to me.) I think its worth it.  just make sure you like sandboxy games that have great physics, as the survival is a bit... choppy still.Also look up youtube vidoes, before you deem this game worth it at the moment.

								Not ready for prime time by any stretch.  There's little to no documentation.  You load up in survival mode already nearly starving with no food around depending on the map and no instructions on how to acquire food.   Sometimes you'll see deer ... walking on their two front legs sideways up the side of a mountain.The walking sounds are literally physically painful to hear more than ten seconds.A lot of the textures are at best placeholders.The forum seems dead other than people asking if they should buy the game.

								if steam had a 'not ready just yet button'just played 15 minute's of it.i gotta say it's a solid idea and it would seem there are plaenty of large scale update's.i'l start with saying iam not normally a graphics junky,but for me this is way below par to the point where its just terrible to look at,even worse in game compared to the the store vid's.dissapointed to say the least.i hope they update the texture's as i'd like to give it another go at some point.for now it looks like something on a par with oblivion (elder scroll's) even the menu fells and looks very dated.iam looking for a refund untill further updates.there are no systems proplems as far as i can tell as the game ran well on high setting's,tbf with the low standard set by the graphics i would be amazed if it dident run well.so for me this quite cleary no for now.i will change my reveiw if and when the game bring's itself into 2017.

								Did you play LEGO as a kid?Did you yearn for your LEGO men to smash everything you built in a war?This is the game for you then.I hardly ever write reviews, but seeing as there is a surge in negative reviews based entirly on this 'paid mod' debacle, I figured it was only moral to throw in my ""Yes"" vote.I don't intend to 'buy mods'; but that doesnsn't stop this from already being a highly entertaining title, not to mention educational.I've learned more about machinery and physics in a few hours with ME; than I have in school, ever.Machinery is not limited to 'realistic and existing' types of builds either; if you can imagine it, you can prolly work out how to build it; for the most part.This game is well worth the money, even at this early point, and weekly updates by Keen constantly keeps fresh content flowing, and makes each week a mini Christmas.

								Too complicated, laggy, and confusing for me. I respect the developers behind this and Space Engineers; just, if you are looking for a game you can kick-back to, this won't be it. You need to invest some serious time learning how to play.			"

								This game sucks. It should NOT of been released. laggy, buggy, half the time I cant even load a game before it crashes. It would take WEEKS to accomplish ANYTHING in this game. I have tried everything and it is still crap. The creative mode was NOT made for creating. You cant even stop moving when you want to.. its like your character is running on ice, you try to stop but he keeps going. I tried to make a tower, made the tower first and then tried to put stairs in. wouldnt let me. So fine, I deleted a few blocks before the tower fell down, and broke the base blocks. I tried to delete the broken ones to put new ones.. wouldnt let me. Tried to just put new ones, wouldnt let me. So I said screw it and just went to a different part to start all over.. I made the stairs first and THEN tried to make the tower.. BUT THE WALLS DONT CONNECT TO THE STAIRS. So you have a tower with stairs in the middle and a HUGE gap between the walls and stairs. Wow. DO NOT BUY, if your into this kind of game, please, save yourself the money and just buy minecraft. So much easier.. and more fun.			"

								Keen are excellent liars.Very skilled.They make the claim that SE and ME have two diffrent design teams, yet claim that when one has a patch that benefits both games since they are made on the same engine that things can be moved over.For example they claimed adding planets in Space Engineers would help Medieval Engineers.Despite planets being in for several months ME planet is still a static world not a planet.The most damning evidence however is the updates.When SE goes into bug fixing so does ME, despite SE now moving into Beta (the time for bug fixes) and ME is still in alpha (the time for adding content).However it seems SE and ME have the same team working on both games, when ME came out their was a clear lack of updates for SE, when they started working on Planets for SE, ME updates moved to bugfixing and smaller stuff like ""siege"".When ME first came out SE moved into a period of Bugfixes that hardly fixed any bugs.Now both games are in a perioud of bugfixing and I'm supposed to be gullible enough to believe the fixes for ME aren't the fixes they made for SE carried over since they share the same engine?Keen invested 10 million of ""his own money"" into a company that is supposed to create ""TRUE"" Ai.I have a hard time believing that with a 10 million investment with programmers who are not able to program a decent engine without massive memory leaks and broken multiplayer are supposed to accomplish something that more competent and funded programmers declare is impossible given current technological limitations?Someone give me what ever he is smoking.

The games get a lot of hype and all of the sudden they've being abandoned. So as far as I know Valve is partially responsible for this. This game was so promising and fun until the devs decided to abandon their product. They just took the money and focused on different products. I don’t know about you guys but I WANT THE REFUND.  "

								I played the game for about 30 minutes before I could only be shocked at how awful it was.I love Space Engineers, and it's obvious that the devs prefer that over this game, but this looks like it hasn't been touched for years. It runs terribly (I have a good PC), the graphics were just confusingly broken and the gameplay was non-existant.Buy Space Engineers instead, it's got a lot more support than this.			"

								(should a bug be fixed ill remove it) (maybe this will slowly become more updated where It could be a thumbs up sometime. id say the bad still outweighs the good currently)Game was updated removed some. Clipping through trees then being flung - Happened twice when a tree fell NEXT to me it catipulted me a good distance enough to kill meBuilding in workbench freezes up - Cant build anything out of a workbench even when all supplied materials are in its invintory can only destroy the bench and make a new one or spam click till it does what it should. Modders - From what it looks like this game has released absolutely nothing in terms of mod API, a good quarter of the time SE updates come from modders i notice. Here the most success ive seen in workshop is when people can create a functioning door with the tools they are given. Physics Beyond hilarious and its just not worth going in detail. A rope and torsion gate snaps and swings erratically breaking all common sense of physics it moves on its own. Structural integrity  Placing a block 3 blocks away makes something else collapse. 3 blocks away a battlement staircase crumbles because I put a block 3 blocks away from it. Structurally It does not make sense things placed very far away affect things it shouldnt. (easier to see than explain)			"

I have no bias over this game, its alright, has some nice stuff. But really... In all honesty.. No content. If you'r entertained for hours by clicking a pen, this game is for you. If you have around 100 hours in skyrim, and proud, dont wast 20$ on this... You will play for about 5-6 hour if you'r lucky. I dont wast time with long reviews, but if you'r a pen clicking fan of this game, your opinion of my review is bias and simply false. Fact is, this game goes months unupdated, and has nothing in store for you. Space engineers on the other hand, worth it.			"

								Pros:-...idk i just used refund...(maybe physics)Cons:-(i will skip bugs since it is in early access)-Even if you have the best system and run it on max settings graphics don't look like they are at videos/photos, structures aren't actually real/solid... anyone can see that they are ""combined papers"".-as i mentioned above even with the best system you have big perfomance issues (and those graphics don't worth it   seriously)-the worst UI a game can have (even a garbage has better UI nowdays)-the map is actually like a browser online game and the landscape is the same everywhere without any signs of water or  some sort of desert or snow ( ok desert/snow maybe isn't so necessary but i wonder how they call this ""MEDIEVAL"" without water, and I know that water is hard to program but if you can't manage water then you shouldn't even release such title ) and the trees are all the same without details etc. Though the description says there is an entire planet to explore...?-the AI is crap, only some bandits and some wild life that don't function well (e.g. deer realises it must run away from you  when you have reached it...). When you build anything then it is empty without any sign of life except of you... and there  is no reason to build anything for defense since there is nothing to attack you except of a player with a siege engine and  that's all of the combat... you ""trade"" boulders... (if you play multiplayer).-multiplayer is empty, only 1-3 low pop servers-no armor/weapons ( only a poorly designed crossbow for hunting and your tools )-as for the building system seems nice to handle but since this is a game that focuses on medieval engineering it should  have rich variety of tier structures... e.g. there is only stone and wood structures... where is limestone/adobe and much more that should be in-game ? even other survival games have richer variety and they are not based on physics/building  so much.-ok some of the above would be tolerable if the game had launched this week but it is out for 2+ years!-And generally any other con you will see in other reviews.Definitely doesn't worth 19-23 bucks, it was just an easy cash crab product that has no future. (To understand how little content this game offers his downloadable size is 1,9GB... a 2015-2017 3D game full of heavy physics...) "

								Not even the little brother of Space Engineers, which I loved and still love, but this one is just not fun yet. Too few tools, opions are VERY limited.You can't compare it to SE. Better give it some months and come back later, when its worth the price.Not recommended at this time.			"

								Im a fairy experience survial genre player but they've made building in survival mode in this game a serious chore. I think to myself ""OOOHH lets build some castles"" but then I remember how annoying it is to figure out how to building even a simple structure and change my mind. Its fine if you don't mind learning to build, there seems to be some pretty extensive learning to do, I just don't have the time that I'm willing to put forth. Also, I find no entertainment in any kind of creative mode in any game. That being said, for someone like myself, I couldn't recomend this game.			"

								I absolutely love this game to pieces, the environment is so beautiful and the textures are fantastically modelled, this game shows great promise already with siege warfare mechanics and its dynamic building which already has a broad range of options. The destruction is wonderful, it looks so real it scares you, the way walls crumble, roofs cave in and buildings implode. However its still in a early build and there are many small but vital mechanics missing, such as the ability to remove rubble and debris which can pile up and become a nuisance, the game tends to crash while loading maps and destruction of buildings cause serious lag even to the best of computers. This game is great already, but I would wait just a year for it to be fully developed and playable. ;)			"

								Lots of potential but don't expect any kind of game it is building straight and simple. The sandbox editor on Far Cry probably has 100 times as much stuff and you can actually make your own game out of it. That said lots of potential here but I probably won't revisit it for several months.			"

								Everything you build collapses under its own weight. The building mechanincs are annoying and hardly manageable. It is difficult (not impossible) to get pieces to place the way you want, where you want, or how you want. They kinda have a mind of their own. The absolute worst medieval sandbox game I've played and its supper dissappointing because it looked like the sandbox I've been wanting. I wish the structures did not collapse and I wish there was programmable AI, like blacksmiths. clerks, etc. I guess I'm going to have to keep waiting for a game like that. First person sandboxes like this seem fun and I want a good one, but this one is just irriating and tedious.			"

								As of right now, I do not recommend this game unless you are a hardcore architecture nerd. Even those feeling the itch to live out their own medieval fetishes should stay away until this is more developed. For what it is (a tech demo with limited ""game"" functionality) this beast looks promising; alas, there is little to do beyond build at the moment.+Game engine is pretty.+Block placement improved upon since Space Engineers.+Peaceful atmosphere with many block options.+Terraforming is implemented.+Knocking down castles is satisfying.-Physics are wonky.-No animals.-Limited decorative items.-NO MULTIPLAYER YET.-No farming.-No weapons beyond siege equipment.-No survival aspects yet.-The heat coming off of your GPU will relieve the neighborhood of snow.

								This being a alpha game i can't say much for what ive seen. The physics look awsome but the game is by far not very playable and just simply boring to play unless your slinging cannon bals at huge buildings to watch it crumble. Now this jsut be me but thats what i think personaly. Hopefully they will get out of this grid based buidling system they implemented since it makes building hard. Object orianted building games are much more popular and alot less clunky. If the devs see my reveiw think on it. Space engineers is much better only because its in space and has massive ships and a much less clunky building system. Midevil engineers is a step backwards in my opinion.			"

								Medieval Engineers: Ancient Ruin Simulator.The game is pretty basic right now. You can build some castles, some bridges, a few mechanisms. You can then break them with stone balls.Pretty good, but the the physics engine is so broken, you'll be building something and then suddenly for no reason on the OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDING, something will break. That wouldn't be so bad if it werent for the fact that YOU CANNOT DELETE DEBRIS. AND EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF DEBRIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO FURTHER DAMAGE BLOCKS. You cannot place a block with debris in the way, so you must try to bulldoze the debris out of the way awkwardly with your body, sometimes further damaging your building. Remember the torch tool from Space Engineers? There is NOTHING like that. Let's say you have a column and the above example happened and a bit of debris damages and chips the bottom block of that column. YOU MUST NOW DELETE THE WHOLE COLUMN FROM THE TOP OF THE COLUMN DOWN TO REPAIR THAT ONE BLOCK. developers: PLEASE ADD A WAY TO DELETE ALL DEBRIS. Also, add a tool so that I can repair a damaged block without having the replace the block.ALSO, THIS GAME AND SPACE ENGINEERS IS ULTIMATELY BORING BECAUSE THERE ARE IS NO AI. I can understand with Space Engineers, because it would be too complicated to script AI NPCs to try and navigate and use all the different designs of ships dynamically. BUT now with the medieval setting, you HAVE TO add some villager AI, a way to assign jobs. This game will be boring fast.			"

								AVOID THIS GAME (for now)!!! Game looks cool, but it ate my GTX 970 for breakfast. Simply will not play on anything less. My GPU will handle AC: Black Flag, Shadow of Mordor, and other newish games at 2160p with framerates at or around 50-60fps. This game plays in 1080p at 30ish with noticeable stutter, unless destroying objects, in which case the framerate drops into the teens. Bought an extra copy for a friend who plays space engineers, but the game won't even start on his computer (roughly equivalent to, but not on the list of, minimum required graphics). Maybe with some serious improvements Medieval Engineers will become playable. I hope so. And I will change my review if this is ever the case. But for now, I want a refund, and you will too.			"

								I would like to start this review by saying that I am biased. I was thinking that this game was the greatest idea ever and tried to like it. It just sucks though. It looks pretty and IS a good idea, but it was made poorly. THIS IS STILL EARLY ACCESS and may improve. I hope that it does. This game has great potential. It is very limited at the moment however. There is no multiplayer at the time of me writing this review, it has bad physics in some aspects, and gives you a very small plot of land for your castle. I want to search for a perfect spot and not just be given a bad one. I don't even want to be GIVEN a good one. I want to search for it. You don't have to gather resources either. It is very hard to use with many complicated controls and poor programming. I honestly think that this game will get much better, but from what I've seen, it is not up to standards yet.			"

								Steam overlay doesn't work even though Steam had an update a while back to hook into DX11 games. MultiGPU support isn't there, meaning it works but everything flickers.I see all these pics and videos of epic destruction physics, yet I try destroying a huge stone bridge and only one support is left and it's still holding up, then it falls and part of it stops midair not after I destroy the support and one end of the bridge connected to the ground, but the other side connected to land as well. Not how weight works last I checked. Bridge that looks like []--------    [] should fall.Red Faction Guerilla, and even Demolition Company has better physics than what I'm experiencing so far.I'll wait for a few updates and try again. But I better see some progress, and something better than what is currently out there.Ah, I see. Of course people find my review unhelpful because they like the game and noone else can possibly have a bad experience with it. Grow up and provide an argument besides ""It's Early Access"" at least.			"

								This is going to be a short review because I'll definitely change it. For now, I don't recommend it. Why? Because it doesn't have enough content yet (in my opinion). I've been playing Space Engineers (made by the same people) and it has plenty of things to do and see, while, for the similar price of $20, Medieval Engineers just doesn't quite have enough to warrant the price tag.Yes I know it is Early Access, and the base building is absolutely awesome, but I found myself playing for about 20 minutes and then getting bored. I will definitely change this review in the future when more content is added and when multiplayer is added. I regret buying it at this stage (21/02/2015).			"

								If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

Early Access Review
								This review is based on early accessed version and I'll edit this once I deem fit, blah blah blah.In short: Not now. (Unless you have a lot of money and you don't know how to spend it, then, fo for it).This game looks very promising, and, don't get me wrong, I do like this game (Umm, maybe I'll like later versions). However, there are so many things to remind you that this is not a good choice to spend your $20, for now.Pro:  -The  ""Every thing can be destoryed"" idea is interesting.  -There should be some other pros, but I forgot them...Con:  -Bugs. Yes, this is in early access. But, hello, for a $20 early access title you won't expect to find bugs every single minute, which I'm not exaggerating. Most of them are just minor glichs which we're already get used to, thanks to Ubi, EA and many others, some of them are serious bugs which will pervent you from building what you want to build, which is the whole point of this game.  -Missing content. Some stuff you can clearly see in trailer can not be found in game (Corner celling and Wall flags, for example). This is not a big problem since I believe the developers will add them in future patchs. But, don't you thing they are a little bit dishonest?Maybe it's just me who have got these problems. Since it's seems everybody else are absolutly love this game. Please correct me if you find the game is fine and the only thing gone wrong is my mind.First, the graphic. I know many people concern this question. But, what would you expect from a medieval building game made by indie developers who are only be known becase the space engineer? No offense, developers, the graphic is fine, and it's actually better than fine, despite I started feeling sick after serval hours working with stones (It's mainly my fault beacuse I'll get the same feeling when mining in Minecraft). However, it is a bit of problem if you want to built an enormous castle using only stone. Their is no ""lighting"" in this game, I mean, no light emitted from torch or other light sources. So it looks the same no matter how you arrange your torchs, every thing is grey (gray) and ugly when you stand inside your stone building.Second, the physic. Most people want this game because of the fancy ""every thing can be destoryed"" stuff. However, I wouldn't recommand to take this serious at this stage. Yes, every thing can be destoryed (Or is it? I once found a spot on a bridge was indestructible, no matter how hard I tried to bring it down, until I shot the block next to it). However, you'll need either a extremely powerful computer or a extremely good patience to bring down a giant castle (Tear down a small lavatory is not fun, is it?). Again, it's like a hybrid car, you know it will be the future, you know every of them on the market are rubbish, and, with finger crossed, you wish this time things would be different. But it's just not, hybrids are as rubbish as usual, they are not ready, yet. I know developing physic engine is a really tough job. And, as a programer myself, I think the developers of this game did a relatively good job. However, for the entertaining sake, this game is not ready (Unless slow and weird physic engine entertains you as much as if it's perfect). ""What if I just want to knock down some moderate-sized stuff?"" Well, if you ask me, I'll say the real in-game experience is not as good as you saw in those trailers. Maybe it's just because the trailers are recorded with some newer versions which are not pulished yet (This explained the missing contents). Or, maybe the developers only showed us the good ones and edited out all bad ones, which is acceptable.Third, misc. Don't buy this game if you're a little bit of a OCD person like me! For example, every block is devided into 4*4(*4) sub-surfaces for you to put smaller item on it, which means you'll never have the chance to put a torch on the enter of a block!!! Ok, this is actually not a big deal. But, hello, I know there are many people in the world will find this annoying just like me XD. Besides these design ""defect"", some bugs will also annoys you to the end of your life (Or hopefully, to the release of a future update). For example, when trying to build a retractable bridge (Which you can find in almost all cartoons that has a castle) I need two ""woodlock"" (Or called something else, I forgot it), which is basicly a rotation axis. Either woodlock works fine, but when I connected them together (SIMPLY connect them with a wood stick, nothing else), both locks suddenly decided to not let wood rotation anymore! Be noticed, the ""woodlock"" here means lock wood to one axis, not lock it completely, I'm sure. Oh, one more thing, aiming your catapult is much harder than sending human to the moon. Please, developers, make aiming easier, or at least, make reloading less painful.			"

								At the moment I can not recommend this game since it has a lot of perfomance issues. In the start menu my GPU (GTX 660Ti) peaks at 60% GPU usage (60% GPU usage for a pre-rendered demo???). In loading screen and in game it goes up to 97-100% GPU usage (with every graphics setting on lowest option in game and everything turned off in Nvidia control panel).There is no ""view distance"" option which might be the core of these problems (since everything in the world seems to be rendered), otherwise it's a fundamental flaw in their code (use of polygonal voxels?) and way of processing.

								Update 2/23/2015STRONGLY DISCOURAGE PURCHASING THIS GAMEOpened the game to a black screen. Closed. Reopened.What kind of company sells a four pack for a single player game without having the multiplayer implemented? I enjoyed Space Engineers, but I have thoroughly lost respect for both this company, and the early access system. This game is a rip off, do not waste your money unless you sit in your basement alone for hours with no one to talk to and dream of camelot.Update 2/21/2015: 21/89 People (24%) found the review helpful. Why is it so hard for people to point out the flaw in an early access game and not get trolled by fanboys? I was a fan of space engineers, however it suffers the same fatal flaw. It's unfinished. The game can only be played for so long before it becomes methodically boring.Tried playing the game again, the game overloads your graphics card when placing terrain textures because it reloads the grass with every block placed. The game crashes so bad that it requires steam to be restarted.Screen blacks out at EVERY auto save. 10/10 It's a game. As it stands now (Early Access) the game is stunningly beautiful... however almost completely unplayable. In my entire time playing the game I have crashed more than 7 times, had my screen turn completely black at least 4 times, only to save the game and return to the same black screen. Save your money and wait for them to work out the kinks.System Specs: Gigabyte (Nvidia) GTX 760 5GHz AMD 8 Core Processor16 GB RAM			"

								^^^Blue box says ""Early Access""  Controls are by default ♥♥♥♥♥♥,,  excaktly like Space engineers.To exspensive for a empty sandbox..Building physics simulator  = 8/10Actual Engineering Mechanics  =  2/10So what do you want?  Build buildings and destroy them, or play with the mechanics.As a Civel Energy Engineering student on 5th Semester this is completely unrelated to reality.It's Authentic but not realistic, nice physics, but in comparison to software we usually useto simulate structural integrety etc, like ANSYS this is purely for fun.Even though the trailer somehow put a emphasis on the Mechanics of the game,right now the mechanics are limitet to pulleys, non-elastic wires, and wheels.As of now, I have yet to discover to build a cogqheel, considering I'm not allowedto attach anything onto the wheel, as is, My current cogwheels are just squaresturning around, it works in a very crude fasion, and does not produce a satisfactoryresult.Buildt a few drawbrigdes, windmils, watermill, and lifts but it's very crude.And I'm really missing- Traditional pylleys, for cable gearing, or guiding- ability to produce round wheels, with plugs for rotational gearing- straight pieces with plugs for linear gearing---- however,,,The building (as in houses) aspect of the game is great.But as a Engineer, I'm not really interested in the buildings, only the mechanics.

								UPDATE:This game is going nowhere, they can't seem to land on a direction, and the constant tiny updates are making sure they don't do anything substantial. OLD REVIEWIn its current state as of May 1st, 2015 the game is not much more then a couple of building blocks and terrain manipulation, as well as downloading other maps and exploring them. This itself is fun for a couple hours, but if you've played creation games you've done this before. The thing that sets this apart currently is the destruction which is immensely satisfying! Buying this in its current state (as of this writing) is for helping the developers and taking their word on this game becoming something greater. I trust them which is why I recommend this, their work on Space Engineers is great and this game has a lot of promise.			"

								This game is really young. It only has its base features so far. I got it early and at a cheap price because I know it will grow into a good castle seige game and/or medieval role playing game. The devs add stuff every week I believe. Since its Early Access the price of the game will probably go up when its finished so if this kind of thing tickles your fancy get it now. Its a bit of a building game so far due to the lack of gameplay mechanics. Destroying steam workshop castles is pretty fun.			"

								This is a really good game.  It could be even better as it is further developed.  Though one thing I don't like is how hard it is to see sometimes.  The view is very limited sometimes and the blocks make it even harder.  Also one thing that should be added is tutorials.  Like have a mode where players can learn how to build stuff like catapults and trebuches from an interactive tutorial, not a video like youtube.  Not all players will know the frames and what does what.  Like what item to use.  Otherwise this is a very good game and I recommend it.  5 stars out of 5 stars.			"

								Wonderful game. It's coming along quite niceley since it's first release. More blocks are added regularly and performance just keeps getting better. If you enjoyed space engineers and are a fan of the medieval time period then you must check this game out. I'd have to say this game is a lot more demanding than SE, a lot harder and there are much more things to take into account. The fact that gravity now plays a role, structures can collapes underneath themselves, and you can't fly.I highly recommend this game if you enjoy survival games, building games, and the emedieval era. You can't go wrong with this one.			"

								I have spent 11 hours in this 'game' trying to put together a fairly simple structure.  I've failed, the online guides and simple interface notwithstanding.  At this point my enthusiasm for the idea of building a stone building with a doorway and roof has waned, so I'll go back to Skyrim for a while waiting for the MMI to be improved.  If I could have just one improvement, it would be an UNDO button for invariably what I expected to happen when I attempted something, didn't happen.  Instead I was usually surprised and regretted the move and recovery was usually impossible.  The best hint I can provide is to save after every successful build step, knowing that you'll want to reload from your save when you make your next build mistake.  If I had another improvement, it would be a construction guide that doesn't gloss over simple things like how to lower the terrain so I can place a block where I want it, how to put roof pieces on top of walls to cover a structure, and why I can place a solid stone block in space over a stairwell and it stays, but a wood floor over the same stairwell won't stand.   All in all, a huge disappointment but with the promise of being loads of fun once it works.  The game seems to have two modes, construction and fighting.  I did not attempt the fighting mode, I wasn't interested in that mode.			"

								not gonna lie... this cgame is complicated if you dont watch any how to`s on youtube or elsewhere... like i haveent done at the point of writing this review, i attempted to build a tower and failed at making the base, the walls and the stairs each time it took me a while to get it worked out which is fun to do but can be frustrating if you dont have nervers of steel and patience of the aliens waiting to invade the earth since 50000 BC.BUT it is still fun you get some nice stuff to start off with which is enough to make acastle or 2 you get cannon balls which you can toss or shoot with self made catapults or whatever otrher contraption you can come up with that works (havent gotten that far yet)personally i give it a 8/10 and yes i have played a total of 72 minutes at the time of writing this review :Dfun to play around hard to master unless you have a engineers degree of some sort which i sadly dont possess			"

								This game definitely doesn't deserve a ""No"" vote, but at this point it is just too early for me. They have done a great job, so far, but the game really feels pre-alpha, not early access. What I like:Making destructive machines that can launch stuff at great velocity and distanceNear infinite flexibility in construction of said machines ore buildingsAbility to place multiple blocks in one positionWhat I don't like:Dynamic objects (for example a cart) regularly become static by accident while working on them and require pieces to be removed to free them up again.Dying from simply pushing on a dynamic object in survivalSurvival only adds death (for now)Will definitely be keeping an eye on the game's progress and look forward to coming back to more functionallity and polish soon!

								One of the reasons i've turned away from early access games. Extremely unoptimized and after the community poll they did months back the engineering aspect has been all but abandoned in favor of turning this into a survival game to appease the kids who seem to want nothing else nowadays.Judging by the state of Space Engineers which has been in development for far longer than this, i can't imagine either game ever having enough content to be more than early access.Avoid it like the plague, wait until it gets out of early access if it ever does, then see if it's worth playing. Right now it's not.			"

One thing I miss is the ability to build boats and sail on the ocean. Imagine being on the seven seas and sailing on a voyage as a viking on your longship. Wouldn't that be fun? If the devlopers added this, the game would be more fun and there would be much more possibilities. However, with the content in the game so far, you can't regret buying it.			"

								First and foremost, this game is Early Access. A new update comes out every week, and I couldn't be happier with the dev interaction with the community. I own both Medieval Engineers and Space Engineers and I absolutely love both. While this game may not be as fleshed out as KSH's other title, it has some of the best building you will ever find in a game. If you enjoy building castles, siege weapons, and medieval vehicles this is the game for you. Structural integrity makes building harder, and realistic destruction amazing. 9/10 (Based on Early Access status)			"

								this game is awesome, but there is some features that i would realy like to be added, and not like a year into the future, but in a month max!    -bigger maps-better survival, that reminds people of the medieval era.-better voxel controls.-better physisks meaning, that i (can) build a giant dynamic structure, without having to cry over all the gliching and spassing it does, physics in this game works, just not for bigger structures, and that annoys me.-more dynamic enviroment, in this game you constantly get reminded that it is just a game, becourse there are too few animal species, too recognizable biome difrence with moore or less no intresting plants or weird stones. look at ARK and you will know my meaning.-UPDATE THE GAME FREQUENTLY PLS, all though you make some of the best games in the world. you still never do the finishing tuch before the game is about to die out, by then people have allready grown tired of it, meaning that it never gets its time of greatness.i'm a big fan of your comunity, a big fan of the games you make, but sometimes i wonder what your comunity is doing when it is time to upgrade/update the games. becourse it takes sooo long with sooo litle content in each update.

								EDITED: Negative at the end....______________________________________________(I opened the game in survival, at least in current form... 2.007)Well, would you look at that, a mountain.I am going to check it out; the vistas are great...There is the valley below, beautiful; and the forest within the valley......now for some shelter, but where?Game world opens, and the quest is on.Like any good sandbox, the entry into the world is great.It could have been any RPG meadow, or mountain pass;but then, it is not quite that, and this will become fairly evidentas soon as the building begins.Blocks, and various machinations, in hand,with a nice little clearing at the forest's edge.""This will make a great location for my knew home.""~winding clock forward~Working out the finishing touches on the roof of a nice two story structure,plenty of room for a growing clan, beds made, torches lit......now for the last few roof blocks...Some how at this point I found a button or click that 'dropped' the tile......clear through the upper floor to cast havoc upon the main floor,debris everywhere, walls tumbling, sheer shock enjoyment/horror.Now what...? Build better walls......and do not drop stuff.Great opening.I look forward to many playing hours in this yet developing game system._______________________________________________________Edtied:So, the first time I opened the game after this review, and it doesn't work.I hate to be an ""it doesn't work"" review.But, there you have it, same ole stupid graphics card interface problem all over the forums.I get it, I can go in and doctor my system to fit the studio screw-up.Sorry...I will fix games and do what it takes to run PC games,but the recent lack of concern for this or that,where studios make problems out to be player failures.Fine, my computer won't play your game.I have a fairly enjoyable library on STEAM, not huge, but enough...I will not waste my time.GTA V taught me valuable lessons about studios and the promise vs production hang-ups.Like Rockstar, It is YOUR game, don't make it my problem.Sucks that I am sitting here comparing some small studio to a mega-giant,but many small studios are now falling into the same pit-traps.I LOVED playing Space Engineers, which is why I bought this game,and now both games are on the retired list;it is really unfortunate (for the gamer) that one studio dropped the ballon two wonderfful concepts.I only write reviews after substantial game play,or when further game play is not an option.For the moment...Wait on buying games from this studio and see how they deal with the issuesalready plaguing their roll-outs.Sorry guys... Both games should be a 10/10, I anticipate the day.			"

								I really like this game even if it ends up being like  all those other Early Access games. What I mean is this: if it stops updating, I would be disappointed and might even stop playing for a while but I won't abandon it forever. It at least has a lot of stuff in it where I can be creative, and its moddable. In its current condition, it has more than other games I played.1. It runs great on my computer. The only time it lags is when it should lag. When I spawn a giant wall just to watch it fall over, it should lag for me. It's like any other great game out there. What makes me even more happy is that they plan on optimizing it more.2. Its moddable, I can download other creations, and even share mine.3. The trailer alone blew me away. Its one thing to make a game with a destructible environment (ie. Red Faction), another with changeable terrain and building blocks (ie. Minecraft), and another with great graphics (ie. Far Cry). But when I experience something with all 3 combined, then I get overwhelmed with excitement. Now add the ability to make custom siege weapons and all that fun. :)4. It's great when you have multiplayer. That means I can play with friends or at least other people. Now add the ability to start a server yourself with 3 options.			"

								REVIEW SUBJECT TO CHANGE:ALPHAPlaying ME in creative mode feels like minecraft in creative mode with the added possibility of everything crashing into rubble.  Lots of cool stuff, the mechanisms and variety of things you can build are cool.  I dont like creative mode however.Survival:  Its in a very early implimenation  however I figured gathering resources and having 2 AI assistants to help with some legwork combined with the general beauty of the game would lend itself to a somewhat nervewracking but overall satifying building experience.  At this current stage of development its... I dont think I can come up with any adjective to describe it.  Survival mode is like playing The Forest but instead of dangerous cannibals the biggest and most dangerous threat is wood chunks.  Dont dare run around them, dont let them pile up... they are a violent and unstable enemy.  Running haphazardly through a pile of wood chunks often causes them to rubberband wildly, breaking the physics and causing them to become flying insta-kill objects.  That can be avoided after careful trial and error and constantly watching your step however another sinister danger lurks.  Everything else.  Trees fall while logging and tumble into  each other sometimes sending one or more flying at an unprectable angle at speeds estimated at roughly 300mph.  Mine in the wrong direction and a rock will tap you and kill you instantly.  In the most extreme case i experienced I went to pick a log off the top of another log and I didnt see what happened however i was thrown cartwheeling through the air and flew off so high that after I respawned I watched my stilll whirling corpse coast over some trees and pinwheel into them knocking a few over.  The AI for the 2 servents you get is utterly appaling.  They will walk into holes and stand staring into the sky.  They will pick up a rock, turn too fast or bump something dropping the rock, and continue to walk to their destinations empty handed, stop at the stockpile, and then turn around to go back.  They will pick up the log that is at the bottom of a pile of logs and try to move it causing them to suffer a similar fate as you would, being crushed or flung into space.  They also only walk.  Very slowly.  From my mine to my stockpile i ran back and forth carrying rocks and transported 6 rocks before they dropped off one.Then the building.... the resources required are quite intensive due to the difficulty in transport.  Thats fine for the most part but the most frustrating thing is the building itself.  I swung the construction hammer roughly 50 times with available ingredients for a wood floor and it didnt even register.  Then it would register one hit, go up from 20% complete to 35% and then *whiff whiff whiff whiff* swinging all over the space just nothing.In short, completely absurd.  Totally unplayable.  If your excited about Survival mode stay far away for now.			"

								I loved playing Space Engineers and when I saw this i got mega hyped. Loved it even at the first stage of its release. It's much much better now than before will better AI and more stuff to build and even a uniqure Castle Seige mode that takes advantage of the castle crashing physics! 11/10 would buy again.			"

								EDITED: Negative at the end....______________________________________________(I opened the game in survival, at least in current form... 2.007)Well, would you look at that, a mountain.I am going to check it out; the vistas are great...There is the valley below, beautiful; and the forest within the valley......now for some shelter, but where?Game world opens, and the quest is on.Like any good sandbox, the entry into the world is great.It could have been any RPG meadow, or mountain pass;but then, it is not quite that, and this will become fairly evidentas soon as the building begins.Blocks, and various machinations, in hand,with a nice little clearing at the forest's edge.""This will make a great location for my knew home.""~winding clock forward~Working out the finishing touches on the roof of a nice two story structure,plenty of room for a growing clan, beds made, torches lit......now for the last few roof blocks...Some how at this point I found a button or click that 'dropped' the tile......clear through the upper floor to cast havoc upon the main floor,debris everywhere, walls tumbling, sheer shock enjoyment/horror.Now what...? Build better walls......and do not drop stuff.Great opening.I look forward to many playing hours in this yet developing game system._______________________________________________________Edtied:So, the first time I opened the game after this review, and it doesn't work.I hate to be an ""it doesn't work"" review.But, there you have it, same ole stupid graphics card interface problem all over the forums.I get it, I can go in and doctor my system to fit the studio screw-up.Sorry...I will fix games and do what it takes to run PC games,but the recent lack of concern for this or that,where studios make problems out to be player failures.Fine, my computer won't play your game.I have a fairly enjoyable library on STEAM, not huge, but enough...I will not waste my time.GTA V taught me valuable lessons about studios and the promise vs production hang-ups.Like Rockstar, It is YOUR game, don't make it my problem.Sucks that I am sitting here comparing some small studio to a mega-giant,but many small studios are now falling into the same pit-traps.I LOVED playing Space Engineers, which is why I bought this game,and now both games are on the retired list;it is really unfortunate (for the gamer) that one studio dropped the ballon two wonderfful concepts.I only write reviews after substantial game play,or when further game play is not an option.For the moment...Wait on buying games from this studio and see how they deal with the issuesalready plaguing their roll-outs.Sorry guys... Both games should be a 10/10, I anticipate the day.			"

								So decided to take the plunge and buy this game, loved space engineers so why not get this one too right?Well what can I say except it's an early access game, there are the basics which allow you to construct castles, bridges, houses and seige weapons to your hearts content though it still lacks that certain something to make it worth while playing for extended periods of time, that and I keep getting random game crashes.Pro's:- Can build to your hearts content- Can place AI peasants, barbarians, deer so it doesn't feel as empty- Has a free build mode as well as survival mode- Graphics are quite good for this stage of development and the game doesn't lag or stutterCon's:- Could do with more building materials- AI are incredibly thick- Survival mode doesn't feel like a survival mode, just a slightly harder free mode- The game does have that random tendency to crash- The physics need work.... one small block of stone should not destroy a large portion of stone foundation like a bomb had gone off on it!- Only weapon in the game is a club...which is just stupid.Will add more as time goes on, would recommend this as the devs will need your support to shape and polish the game into a finished product.If you buy this excpecting miricles then don't whine about it when those miricles don't become reality, that will only happen in time.

If you want a fun sandbox game buy Space Engineers first.Long story short Space Engineers: 415 hours.Medieval Engineers 6 hours.(also kind of hard on low end PC, as this wasn't released too long ago I wouldn't worry about it. just stick to the recommended as it seems to be pretty acurate.)

								My only problem with this game is the texture loading. When I load up a world, I can see the sky box just fine, but the ground has no texture and is black. I have no idea how to solve that problem. I have restarted the map, restarted the game and even reinstalled the game. None of that solved the problem. What I am thinking is that I don't have the proper hardware since i'm on a $300 laptop (aka the craptop to me). This is most likely my computers doing, and not the games. The game looks fun and I would play it if my computer wasn't being a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥EDITOf course 1 day after reviewing the game they come out with a new update. There is no hardware incapatabilities or computer issues. The game was just bugging out. So I hope not to make people confused about my first time playing the game.

								This game definitely doesn't deserve a ""No"" vote, but at this point it is just too early for me. They have done a great job, so far, but the game really feels pre-alpha, not early access. What I like:Making destructive machines that can launch stuff at great velocity and distanceNear infinite flexibility in construction of said machines ore buildingsAbility to place multiple blocks in one positionWhat I don't like:Dynamic objects (for example a cart) regularly become static by accident while working on them and require pieces to be removed to free them up again.Dying from simply pushing on a dynamic object in survivalSurvival only adds death (for now)Will definitely be keeping an eye on the game's progress and look forward to coming back to more functionallity and polish soon!

								I do recommend this game, but there are some flaws. I DO accept that this is an early access game and most of the stuff i want will be in future updates, but the updates do take a while. If you where to watch the trailer you would see that the game is multiplayer, which at this current moment it isn't. I bought the 4-pack thinking i was going to work together and make a giant castle with my friends, when in fact you don't. Though the destruction physics are beyond my comprehesion, multiplayer would be fantastic. Good game though and you should get it when multiplayer is put in.			"

								Now, Don't mistake this game to be anything like space engineers, The people over at Keen have done an amazing job at making this game vary from space engineers, Those of you who have Space Engineers will have to re-think everything you thought you knew about engineering. The Physics complexity, The Graphical beauty and the absolutely stunning soundtrack make this game completely worth the cost! The soundtrack alone is worth buying this game!The downside's are that the game so far has not been completed, so flaws are to be expected, and the structural integrity can crash the game at some point and because it's newer there's a distinct lack of mod's compared to its space-themed counterpart.To sum it all up;Pro's:+Graphically stunning, very good for an alpha, But atleast on my PC, Not too taxing.+Eargasm! The soundtrack is both soothing, and uplifting. If you like medieval themed orchestra, Then the music alone is reason enough to buy this game!+Complex physics.  Something that is hardly ever seen in most games is the formation of rubble in such a believable manner. Your building's will have to stand up to the test of gravity and it really makes you need to think outside the box!+Scroll n' roll. Scrolling with select blocks will give you varients of that block type. This is something i love about Medieval Engineers. Nuff said.+Blockception. You can place a block withing a block withing a block within a bl- (etc.)Con's:-Physics! Y U DO THIS?! Like I said, Amazingly complex and glorious physics and destruction, But these attributes are also a downfall if you build too big! The very structural integrity this game is heralded for is its greatest downfall, requiring you to bear with the limitations of the current engine. Remember, This will probably be changed in later updates.-So, No real weapons? Well, Not yet. You can shoot canonballs but let's be honest. We're all waiting for swords, shields, bows and arrows! The recent addition of Barbarians (destructive A.I.) can't be killed very easily and appear to have their own spiked club as a weapon, which is not available to the player at this time. This will mostlikely change in future updates.Now there are probably some other things, but that's a summary. Also, some blocks are missing from the trailer, My guess is over at Keen, They are fixing up some block dynamics, Checking viability and tweaking the physics engine a bit. The lack of mod's in the steam workshop should be temporary too, as the more people get this, the more modder's will come and grace this gem of a game. You dont even need to own this game to mod it! :DIn the end, I give it a 9.5/10. Good job Keen and thanks for this wonderful addition to my Steam library!			"

								This game has its good points and bad points.It does run on Win8.1 64bit, 8GB RAM, AMD 6 core processor at 3.20GHz, Radeon HD 5670 card but I had to turn down my graphics to the lowest settings to remove all lag.Good is that Its a Medieval sandbox builders game, the graphics are awesome, has flymode, background music is great.Bad points is that loading each level takes awhile to complete & changing settings while in-game takes awhile to complete too, cannot remove trees easily and debris, building floors are difficult, not a lot of building materials to choose from, removing parts of the ground and rebuilding it back up is terrible, in-game sounds needs work, game controls needs work.I know a lot of these problems will be fixed as new updates rolls out but I don't know when. I do recommend buying this game but not right now. Wait a few more months.			"

								I've played about 8 hours so far. Here's some things I've noticed-A castle made out of wood is 10 times stronger than a castle made out of stone-when you build a castle make sure you dont connect your walls to your castle, when the walls are destroyed it will activate a domino effect which stupidly destroys your castle-If you insist on building a stone castle, be sure to put down as many wooden floors and wooden beams as possilbleBasically, stone is very very weak, a light gust of wind could make it violently explodeIf you feel like ""investing"" into this game then go ahead, be remember this is a investment not a game purchase.You're investing in what this game could be, not what it is at the momment.

								Amazing for building and destroying lovers alike- all sorts of building material, NPCs, character w/ customizable clothing colors, and the AMAZINGLY REALISTIC destruction physics. You always want structural integrity turned on if you're like me. The only problem is that the chunks that come from the destruction can cause a severe frame rate drop, and they won't go away unless you change that in the settings.			"

								I am yet to play this game because it does not work with my computer. Yes. That's right. It doesn't work with my computer. My computer is a personally built PC with pretty decent specs and I can run most games fairly well. I don't have trouble running this game's menu but when it comes to actually getting in game, there's no chance. It baffles me how the creators of this game would even release a game in any state with such a glitch. And it's obvious I am not the only one who has this problem. So I just wasted 20$ on a game that is impossinle to play? Amazing. I would not reccomend buying this game until it comes out fully and they have fixed the mass amount of bugs they seem to have.			"

								So decided to take the plunge and buy this game, loved space engineers so why not get this one too right?Well what can I say except it's an early access game, there are the basics which allow you to construct castles, bridges, houses and seige weapons to your hearts content though it still lacks that certain something to make it worth while playing for extended periods of time, that and I keep getting random game crashes.Pro's:- Can build to your hearts content- Can place AI peasants, barbarians, deer so it doesn't feel as empty- Has a free build mode as well as survival mode- Graphics are quite good for this stage of development and the game doesn't lag or stutterCon's:- Could do with more building materials- AI are incredibly thick- Survival mode doesn't feel like a survival mode, just a slightly harder free mode- The game does have that random tendency to crash- The physics need work.... one small block of stone should not destroy a large portion of stone foundation like a bomb had gone off on it!- Only weapon in the game is a club...which is just stupid.Will add more as time goes on, would recommend this as the devs will need your support to shape and polish the game into a finished product.If you buy this excpecting miricles then don't whine about it when those miricles don't become reality, that will only happen in time.

								This game is awesome, not only are you building, but what you build can come crumbling down if you don't built correctly. Glad I have it and can't wait to see what else will be added!			"

								I am loving this game.  And with all the new features that are being added it is going to be an amazing game.  Can't wait till multiplayer goes live.  I would like to see friendly ai units to help defend your castle.			"

								Lots of potential to be as fun as Space Engineers but with gravity! I am hoping that this game will be easier to co-operate in.But like everyone else I have my own crossover idea for this game and it's predecessor: the Space Engineers can enter orbit and harvest the material from the planet. The guys on the ground would try and protect their resources while being under assault from futuristic machines.			"

								 I bought this game when it was available for Early-Early Access for 24 hours, and it was worth it! To see all of the brilliant physics of this game, and the beautiful landscape, and hear the awesome music, it all blew my mind!! I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves realistic physics, awesome graphics, and who loves to be constructive and destructive! Thank you Keen Software House for developing one heck of a cool game, your engineering titles have loads of potential in the gaming industry!!			"

Early Access Review
								this game is probely the best voxel based, physics sandbox i have seen and played, the game is in Early Access so you can't expect lots out of it bearing in mind that it came out a few days ago.the minimum requirements it says that you need at least 1024MB of VRAM(Video memory) and i have 312MB, setting it at the right settings and i get 15-20 FPS and thats on a laptop, this game can run on laptops to big rigs completly fine.i love the physics, especially when you need to build beams to have a second floor under that floor.it has some good motors and pulleys and gears.You need to have a creative mind to play this for  long time (Nerd3) and its alot of funi rate this 9.5/10 because nothing is perfect and there is room to expand on.this game has alot of potential and is great !!!!  :)			"
