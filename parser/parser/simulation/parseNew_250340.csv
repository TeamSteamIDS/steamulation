												UPDATE 28-04-2014So I haven't been very active within Blockland and only recently I've learned that Return to Blockland has been shutdown since February. Well, bugger. One of the biggest things on this review was RTB's existence.Not to worry! The community has already found ways to circumvent its shutdown and there are backup pages and a whole new chat addon thingy that imitates RTB's.Backups: http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=253292.0IRC Chat: http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=255973.0(I SERIOUSLY hope that Steam doesn't block the links any time soon. If it does, let me know and I'll fix it.)I haven't tested them and I don't have time to. But as far as I can tell, they all look pretty legit.By the way, here's a cool FAQ I've found in case you have any questions: 


Blockland Steam FAQ 
A Guide for Blockland
By: Demian

			Some basic information about Blockland and frequently asked questions that have popped up on the Steam discussion forums.		


//////////////////////////////////////This game might sound cheesy for some people at first glance. ""I mean gee, a game where you play with legos online? What is this, people never heard of how bad Roblox turned out to be?!"" (Personally I like games where you build stuff very fun, that's why I bought Blockland years ago in the first place...)Oh trust me, it's a lot more than that. This game is like a fusion between Garry's Mod and Legos, but FAR easier to play. You can do pretty much anything in a stylized block world - houses, cities, deathmatches, survival games, racing tracks - and a lot more with its intuitive building and eventing system. Eventing is a sort of very very easy ""scripting"" within Blockland that you can use to make certain blocks to do certain things from within pre-set lists of actions that you can do to the block for it to do something you want and a lot more. It might seem very overwhelming at first, but when you start playing with it you'll get used to the idea quickly.Building, in my opinion, is a little bit trickier, as you have to move ""ghost blocks"" around with the numpad (or some other buttons if you're on a numpad-less laptop) and then press enter to deploy a block, and they cannot be floating, nor penetrating the ground or other blocks, unless they are to be built within a Zone Brick which allows you to make actually floating blocks inside of it, so you don't have to make invisible supports for every floating island you might want to do. Buiilding is also very well optimized as you can do a number of moves with the ghost bricks to get them where you want and how you want quickly and efficiently; there exists a macro system where you can ""save"" the moves you do to a block so you can replicate patterns like stairs and stuff like that without much of a hassle. However, building can be clunky as you have to take blocks from a list to put them in your block selection list - you can only carry up to 10 blocks at a time, I believe. However don't let this limit your creativity, as you can do pretty superb buildings in this game as evidenced by the game's great community - there is lots of support for this game, the developers and its players won't hesitate to help you with any problems you might have with the product, and there are just a LOT of addons in this game that do not allow it to ever be boring, especially with the Return to Blockland addon which is basically a community hub for the game, complete with a chat room, news, and a ton of other addons that are mounted into RTB for easy access, deactivation and (un)installation. RTB can also be downloaded for your server so you can get new Administration features, get the addons of your server listed in the server browser, so the players don't have to download it directly from your server (given they're hosted in RTB), and a few more features.WARNING: Read the update above first. RTB is no longer functional, but there are backups.Making addons for this game is, from what I understand, not tremendously difficult, and as long as you have the talent and willpower to make that one brick you can't find but need, or to make that weapon of your dreams, have a Ferrari in your garage or just a simple addition like a new face for your Blockhead, or maybe a song you want your Music Brick to play, all in all there is no (?) limit to the addons you can make for the game. I wish I could write from experience, but unfortunately, apart from a song or two I didn't make any addons for this game.What I WAS ABLE TO do however was host servers and oh boy, coming from a person who can't ever host servers because of his connection not ever letting people connect, this was a HUGE plus for me. Even the player with the most blocked-off router can host games for their friends and never be hindered by issues like tremendous lag or timeouts, in my experience I found the netcode of Blockland to be very good. At least... I think this is the netcode's doing.The gameplay is very appealing and so are the graphics, as they are very beautiful and, unsurprisingly, very colourful, stylized to look like a cartoon, similar to the likes of TF2, except on legos. Yeah. Graphics for me are very hard to describe. The ""maps"" (or just... plains) are roughly customizable so they have bodies of water or different types of surfaces, which can spice up the game a bit - I've always liked to build in maps with lots of water.Overall, the game is very enjoyable and on the right servers it can be a ludicrous amount of fun. It is really amazing how such a simple and cheap game like this can provide so many hours of entertainment, from messing around with a few people to doing giant, elaborate buildings, from having mindless fast-paced deathmatch to having class-based capture the flag matches on carefully structured builds and just so much more. Blockland is truly a game for the ages, despite a few flaws like clunky building and some instances of lag when there are too many bricks within a server or when they're being duplicated.I have this game since V12 and now it's on what, Vtwenty-something or so, and from there and now I still recommend it to everybody, kids to adults. The only thing I DIDN'T like is how they got rid of maps in an update months back. Back then you had maps like Bedroom and Kitchen, that were... well, semi-realistic bedrooms and kitchens. I REALLY liked those! But hey, they needed to take a radical action to let the game evolute and that was the end result I suppose...TL;DR: This game is great! Totally recommended! A bit clunky to get started, but you'll get used to it! Lots of addons to help you, client-side and server-side! The graphics are also beautiful!			"

												I love this game but I absolutely cannot recomend it.Don't get the ""not reccomended"" wrong - this IS a good game. A few years ago I'd definitely have recomended it, but now it's dead. Blockland is a game where 90% of the content is produced by the users in the form of mods. Badspot, for most of Blockland's history, actually helped these modders by modifying the game engine to better suit their creativity. This helped keep the tiny community alive. A service called RTB was released by a game modder called Ephialtes* - it had a friends list, private chat messages, IRC, and allowed people to download mods directly to the game. This is probably the main reason Blockland had any form of community at all.This has changed. Badspot released an update that would remove maps and replaced them with slightly improved graphics. Seems to make sense, since you can just build everything with bricks, right? In actuality, the brick limit is atrociously low** - on the other hand, terrain could be set to loop indefinitely. We were able to get around this by making the terrain on maps and building on top of the terrain. Now, terrain can only be done by one of two methods:    1. Building it with bricks    2. Modular TerrainOption #1 leaves vehicles entierely out of the question, because the vehicle physics are atrocious - they are guaranteed to get stuck over and over again, and there's little to no smooth slopes because bricks are boxy. You CAN make brick terrain look good, but it takes an insane amount of bricks and you'll likely hit the brick limit. You can phase right through a brick if you're going fast enough in a vehicle.Map Terrain vs Brick Terrain: http://i43.tinypic.com/2rc1ulh.png Option #2 is modular terrain, which is bricks that have smooth ramps. Slightly better, but it's ugly as sin and still contrained by the brick limit. You can also phase right through it if you're going fast enough in a vehicle.Modular Terrain: http://pixpipeline.com/s/eaf878362c19.jpgBadspot will NOT fix many of the issues, most notably the ones above. The modding community has practically pushed the game to its limit. Badspot prefers to argue instead of fixing issues. Many of the good people have been driven away. The community has been stripped to a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ weaboos who crack at least one 9/11 or holocaust joke every two minutes. There's many other problems with this game, but this is how calm criticism is handled at Blockland: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54466069/banned.pngLastly, and most importantly, Badspot is simply unprofessional -- he accuses the people who don't like the game's development path of being ""entitled"" - but if anything, Badspot is entitled. These veterans produce most of the game's content in the form of gameplay. They host the game's servers for free. They are where all of the content comes from, and Badspot refuses to update the game to better suit their creative impulses. Blockland would never get anywhere without them.Many major Blockland people have plain left due to these problems. People such as Ephialtes and Kalphiter. This game is great - but now, it's dying.I wish Badspot or really anyone would make some kind of sequel and start all over again and get around the development problems -- I would buy that straight away, and I'm sure the vast majority of the community would too.Do I recomend this game? Unfortunately, I simply can't. *I'm talking about the new RTB, not the original v0002 one. Yes, I know it's technically been around for years but the old RTB has little in common with the current one.**Although the brick limit was raised, it is still atrociously low if you want to have a massive terrain map.

Abandoned by a careless developerFirst:Don't be fooled by the game's trailer. Blockland isn't a lego universe full of fun things to do and intresting people to meet. This game is a trap. I have been playing it since it's earliest days (I was literally one of the first hundred people to buy this game). It was fun at the start when there was still clans and builds and gamemodes were still new and exciting. But it hasn't risen with the times. Nothing new has really been made since 2010. It WAS a very fun game to play, when there was still new things being made and that could be discovered. But nothing like that has happened for this game in a very long time. And with years the community deteroriated to become what it now is today. And the patehtic community of this game only more so worsens it's already near-broken state. Blockland is only kept up and running so Eric can leach more money off it. Little has he done to update it or improve it in any way for a long time. And guess what, he doesn't care. He's literally said multiple times that the only reason he is still giving Blockland even a fraction of his time or effort is because it makes him too much money for him to stop. And when I say a fraction... I truly mean even less than that. He has done nothing and put virtually no effort into improving the game or updating it in any way that the players or the community would appreciate. The game is NOTHING like it is in the trailer. Sure a lot of that stuff shown in the trailer is possible but I can personally garuntee that not a single server being hosted at this time has anything even close to that exciting or unique. The community for this game is virtually nonexistant (unless you're dying to be in a commuinty full of autocratic♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I have not seen a gaming community full of more hostile and irrational people in my life. This is why all of our servers have nothing good. People on the forums site are pathetic. They do absolutely nothing to upkeep the game or make it better in any way, and spend virtually all of their time ranting on about how the community sucks and making drama threads pointing fingers at users when in reality EVERYONE on the site is doing the exact same thing for the game: NOTHING. Which is why it sucks! :) No, you won't be doing anything like what's in that trailer. Hate to break it to you. Unless you want to spend days learning how to make all of those things yourself and submerge yourself in a community full up stuck up arrogant♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ don't buy this game.To the insightful developer comment I recieved below: (This was ORIGINALLY his response, before he changed it to what it is now)Badspot:""So we're looking at a negative review of the Blockland community from someone who aimbots in counter-strike. Nice. Blockland: Generally disliked by cheaters.""Last played Counter-Strike: Source: Apr 24, 2011 11:14am1 VAC ban(s) on record	 | Info88 day(s) since last banNice. But, I think not. Recieved the VAC ban from being KL'd, and you can't appeal them. However, I do like how when responding to negative reviews of your product you deviate from actaully addressing ANY of the problems users mention about your game and instead try pinpoint things you find wrong with them to use as leverage against everything that is wrong with YOUR game and how YOU are chosing to manage it. Though it doesn't suprise me in regards to how I have seen you manage our community over the years. You want to talk about professionality? Rather you would search for dirt on people who write bad reviews of Blockland instead of actually addressing any of the problems that are wrong with your game? I suppose you would, and not really suprisingly... :/http://prntscr.com/2qsz4oAbove is an example of this games professional developer banning a user from his forums for asking when the game will be updated again. This is his professional ban message he leaves them with: ""Get ♥♥♥♥ed, I don't owe you anything."" ----EDIT:Basically in his other comments he's made in my review (besides the response he left at the bottom of my review) he complains that the things that I say are bad about this game he cannot fix, and that I don't complain about enough; or really any architectural features about the game itself. Honestly the community for this game is so hostile and disfunctional (which is what this review tried to originally describe) and when you put that on top of the fact that the game has not been updated in over a year and is managed very poorly I personally have come to the conclusion that this game is not worth spending your time and money on. That is the point I was trying to make.To talk about the actual gameplay of this game and it's features:The game features a menu where you can select what brick you want and place it ontop of another brick, to build virtually whatever you want. This, along with a minigame creator where you can choose to spawn with weapons and start a deathmatch with other players. Now that there isn't maps anymore I have basically listed all of the features of this game.There has been ONE new / neat thing that was added into the game since the games actual realse by the developer himself . And this was actually really pretty cool (when it came out in 2010) where you can ""wrench"" bricks to name them, spawn weapons on them and (the new part) ""event"" them to where you can setup conditional events to make them check for / do certian things (like explode, play a sound, emit an particle, ect.) when you activate them (or when something does). Other than this however (and keep in mind this came out in 2010) there has been nothing new that has been added into the game through an update in the complete history of this games existance. (besides the removal of maps and addition of very poorly optimized shaders - which was hardly an update, if you ask anyone in the community)CAN you build things in this game? Sure you can! I've built castles, houses, all that stuff... But it takes a lot of time to learn how. It's not easy to do. And you're not going to be getting help along the way, as the hostile commuinty doesn't put up with people who have questions, or can't manage things on their own. So if you want to, yes you can - but you're going to have to learn all by yourself and it takes a lot of time before you will get to making anything even half as spectacular as what's shown in the trailer. It's just really a lot more complicated and a lot less convenient than he makes it out to be. After playing the game and building things in it for seven years the way he is advertising it (quite frankly) seems like some sort of trick - atleast to me. The game doesn't have all that stuff in it currently and all of that would be extremely hard to make on your own. There arent't currently servers like that ready where all of that stuff you saw in that trailer will be waiting for you. You CAN make all of those things that are in the trailer, to be fair. However, just no one really does. So to put it clearly, I just don't get the point. Why show a trailer of your game that is not like your game at all / full of things that aren't currently in your game?TO CONCLUDE: The gameplay of this game is NOT bad. It is just a game that hasn't been updated in forever, and is managed very poorly. If you are looking for a game with a future, that has planned updates, friendly technical support or that has a community full of users that you will enjoy to play the game with, DONT buy this game - because well, it has none of these things.

												Why do I have only 0.2 hours played? I did not buy the game through Steam and do not wish to play the game through Steam, so I have run the game for the minimum 10 minutes to be able to post a review.Perhaps the simplest way to describe this game is with one image that describes the lack of development as well as intolerance of criticism by the developer regarding the game's development and outright punishment of his criticizers. In fact, the developer has pre-emptively banned me from Steam's forum for this game.The developer's current response to this review is literally just a quick one-line dismissal as if playing the game for a long time precludes me from talking negatively about it and then he makes a sales pitch.The developer has finally admitted that he has stopped all development[forum.blockland.us] on the game, as if it hadn't been already obvious considering the lack of updates in the past ten months (no longer true), the half-broken Steam version of the game (broken for a year already), and the extremely low quality and quantity of the updates before then. He has resorted to censoring and banning people who criticize the game's development[blocklandcloud.com], so this should be an obvious sign that the game is done for. When or if you buy this abandoned game, consider the fact that this disrespectful, uncaring and greedy ""developer"" will be getting your money.========Response to developer response (10 August 2014):++++++++++(original developer response)""Hey everyone, right now Blockland is available in the Reboot 6.0 bundle from BundleStars: http://www.bundlestars.com/all-bundles/reboot-bundle-6/6 great Steam games (including Blockland!) for only $2.99!Why not pick it up, play Blockland for 5 years, then leave a negative Steam review?See you back here in 2019!""++++++++++How nice of you to finally respond to one of the most thorough and drama-free reviews once it reached the front page! Oh wait, that's not really a response... it's a sales promotion. A sales promotion is definitely a valid response to everything I've already written here!Believe it or not, it is quite possible to love the art but hate the artist. As a modder myself, I've dealt with years of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when it came to supporting modders and their needs. I had been running a hosting service for quite some time until the day I left, which is one of the biggest reasons I stayed so long. Unfortunately, you decided to take a ""♥♥♥♥ it"" approach when it came to supporting server hosting services (and modders), so now the game's largest two hosting services are gone and the community is left with almost nothing. You have banned users from your forum for criticizing the game, so once I finally had enough of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I left the game. Since you have no power here to permanently delete people's opinions, which you do at your own forum (evidence of this is in the very next segment of this review), this was the perfect chance to finally speak my mind without fearing all the possible consequences with which you could punish me. Considering that this review is now the top review, I think it's reasonable to say that people have had enough of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, too.It's not like I suddenly started hating the game. While I was still a part of the community, I felt as if I couldn't speak my mind since you punish everyone who criticizes it. I was able to realize my power to reach out to people once I was free from your reigns, so I exerted that power. This isn't some campaign of revenge: it's years of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t finally brought to light.========Update (6 August 2014):The owner of the game (Badspot) has silently banned ""Heedicalking"" from the game's official forum. Heedicalking is an important person in terms of the servers he hosted and his contributions to the community. Heedicalking often talks about the lack of game development on the forum in the most mature way possible. Development has in fact been lacking recently: in fact, there hasn't been a major update in the last 2 years. Many people were expecting him to be banned for simply criticizing the game's development, and voilà, he has finally been banned. The owner of the game is getting extremely defensive towards anyone who dares talk about the game's lack of development.For reference, here are relevant links pertaining to the post removals:http://blocklandcloud.com/heed/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54466069/banned.png========Update (27 June 2014):The owner of the game (Badspot) has banned LewnaJa and me from Blockland's Steam community. He also deleted the entire thread in which he had our responses. The thread (the poster was most likely not the victim) was pointing out how a ban was unfair. The same ban image also happened to be mentioned in an earlier review from February: http://steamcommunity.com//profiles/76561198044732390/recommended/250340/Here is copy of thread: http://blocklandcloud.com/20140626-blockland-steam-removed-thread/The ban reasons for us are the same and the posts cited for our bans were each of our first ones in that thread. This is LewnaJa's ban:http://imgur.com/a/oX0exThe owner has taken similar action towards LewnaJa when he initially posted his negative review and found himself banned from the game's official forum (not Steam's forum provided for the game).Make your own conclusions about why the owner of the game felt so obliged to ban us. Today, the negative reviews have been piling up on the store page to the point where 3 of the 5 shown-to-everyone-by-default reviews were negative and it still remains that way. Fortunately he does not have the power to remove any reviews at all. It must be embarrassing for Badspot to have what is pretty much the front page for his game be covered in negativity.========Original review:I have played this game for more than 5 years (not on Steam) and I am disappointed at how quickly it has declined. Don't be fooled into buying this game just because it looks great. The developers (developer) have abandoned the game. Check out my long elaboration on why I think the game is practically abandoned:http://www.reddit.com/r/BlocklandIsHorrible/comments/267v7h/badspot_is_no_longer_doing_his_fair_share_of_work/The game hasn't had a major update for 2 years and any update for 6 months. The game's most important people have been angry about the developer's (""Badspot"") reluctance to maintain the game's development. Check out this satirical comic which illustrates the developer's greed: http://brockrandcomics.tumblr.com/post/92596058472/filipe-7-22-14CLARIFICATION FOR BELOW PARAGRAPH: server hosting issues do not include those who have bought the game in the classical way and duplicated their purchases to their Steam accounts, because they can still run the game the classical way. The below paragraph applies to those who have exclusively bought the game from Steam and not on the Blockland website.If you buy Blockland through Steam, you will have a lot of trouble hosting a server. Although there is technically a way to host a server by modifying the program's arguments, you can't play the game at the same time. Want someone else to circumvent these restrictions by hosting a server for you under your name? Too bad; hosting services cannot be used by people who bought the game through Steam. The developers have neglected Steam users and deprived them of server hosting for over 6 months. I think it's clear that they do not care anymore and are only trying to make a quick buck out of what the game has left.(THIS HAS BEEN AN OUTSTANDING ISSUE FOR OVER A YEAR)Some of you legacy players may find these statistics about the game's decline interesting: http://blocklandcloud.com/ "

												[If you dislike reading seemingly irrelevant information you are free to skip to the bottom of this review. There you will find my recommendation. Thank you!]So this game has been one of my favorite building games of all time. Starting in 2010 along with the majority of what I would say was our community, I bought the original Blockland and was having a great time. Things were getting done, updates being made. There were these classics maps I'll never forget: the Bedroom, the Kitchen, and the Slopes. I enjoyed this game, and I was estimated to be playing it about 10 hours a day or more. (Update: Many people don't believe I played this game as long as I claim. The truth is, Blockland existed before (its release on) Steam. For this reason, Steam has not registered all my hours from when I played it before. I only recently migrated to Steam Blockland from the original Vanilla Blockland. Hope that clears things up!)It took some time but an insightful man by the name of Ephialtes in-game decided to build Blockland a new system. I believe it was around 2011-2012 that this became widely-used. It was called Return to Blockland, and was basically the Steam client for Blockland before Blockland was actually on Steam. It had a 'Workshop' (servers that hosted add-ons you could directly download from), Add-On Manager, Friends client, global IRC chat, chat rooms, easy-to-use settings system for your server, add-on preferences manager, and so much more. It was the true revelation of Blockland's existence. It brought upon a new experience for the Blockland community, and gave it a modern feel.Then this game went on Greenlight.That officially marked the downfall of RTB, which would eventually be shut down because Steam replaced 1/3 of its functionality. There would no longer be a place to manage your add-ons, chat globally with other BL users, find your friends (since they would no longer be on RTB and you didn't know if they had Steam), and last but not least, you could no longer manage your server like you used to.That probably drove me away the most. I stuck around for a bit, hosted a multitude of mildly popular servers as well as a 32/32 player MERP server that consisted of most of my time. After about four months, I kinda lost interest and began the process of leaving the BL community. I left a legacy, but even that would soon be forgotten...So you know that game called Minecraft? I ended up spending almost all of my time on that. I hosted some very popular servers on Minecraft, met some great friends, and was enjoying it. I almost forgot about Blockland completely, but then my friend (who shall remain nameless) decided to get Blockland after I showed him a fun little gamemode on it called Renderman. He got it, and when I saw that he did, I decided to hop back on and play with him... but I didn't do much otherwise.I truly came back about two months ago. I began hosting my MERP server, probably just to feel the nostalgia and see all the empires that had been built on it. A friend of mine by the name of Amir (a full-time player of my server back when it was popular) happened to stop by. We had an awesome reunion, played a bit of MERP (not really. Just remarked on how sucky our builds were), had a lot of fun. I began playing Blockland much more.And then I stopped. Garry's Mod took up my time. I managed a community on there and couldn't depart from them. But that wasn't the only reason.I lost interest.So anyways, if you got to the bottom of this review reading through an incredibly long backstory and wondering why the heck I'd write a story like that, I congratulate you. You have the patience of a... you, but none of this was really a review, was it?So here's my take on the game.If you want to play a game with a large amount of active community supporters/respectful, mature players, don't get this game.If you want to play a game where you build anything and can do anything (with the help of a bit of programming knowledge or the visually-based event system), get this game.If you want to play a game where servers are always full and there is an easy way to liven up your game with user-created add-ons, don't get this game.If you want to play a game where you can host a server of any kind, have some fun with Pirate Ship DM gamemodes, and basically shoot your friends with laser pistols and horse rays (yeah, they turn them into a horse), this game IS FOR YOU.BUT. If you want a game that will keep you interested for years to come, always ready for that next update, always ready for that next big thing... don't get this game. It's unkempt, uncombed, and unfathomably stagnate.But I might be wrong. What if YOU are the next big thing?In my opinion, this game is NOT recommended due to the lack of interesting things that may be found in Blockland. It's a great game, don't get me wrong, but it is running on steam (get it hahahahaaha... haha. ..ha... sorry) and no longer has that spark of a game that has true potential. Maybe Badspot can turn this around one day. And maybe you can be a part of that. Me, on the other hand, have exhausted the game of Blockland. I like the game, but I can no longer play it.Maybe it'll be different for you.			"

												I've probably put over 1500 hours into this before it came to steam.This is one of the best games I have ever played. It's limitlessly open, with a great mature (edit 4 months later: kind of mature, it's a lego game, of course it'll attract kids.) community, and there's just so much to experience, from dogfights, to city RPGs, to gangster shootouts, to go-kart races, to who-knows-what! There's thousands upon thousands of addons (plugins/mods) for the game that are extremely easy to install and the game is still going strong since it's initial build in 2004!Buy this game!Buy it!Buy it now!

												Okay. What i'm about to tell you actually ♥♥♥♥ing happened.I joined an rp server with 15 people. At first i was confused, and went around being a general knob, stealing cars, sitting on people, ect. Somehow i didnt get banned for fail RP. After about an hour of observing these people mingle around, I decided to join in. I sat with them as they put some dude on trial for some reason. Then, everyone got in a treehouse and there was lava and blah blah blah it was interesting, but this isnt the best part. So, after this, everyone started to properly RP. People went to their houses, got their cars, ect. Intrigued by this, I decided to stalk an unsuspecting household and observe everyday life in Blockland. Soon enough, they relised i was watching them, and they dubbed me 'the stalker under the porch' and 'the creepy guy by the window'. I stood around, holding a bunny doll and staring motionlessly in at them. After a while, I managed to get into their house. I stayed low, and snuck around, eating their pizza. Soon enough though, they found me. I retreated into a corner, under their stairs. And they locked me in. Kept me as their pet. I couldnt escape, i couldnt move, i couldnt run. But they fed me and talked to me, and I gave up hope on ever getting out. After a while they got bored and buggered off (they let me out after some persuasion though). After another hour of building my own ♥♥♥♥♥♥ yellow house, i returned to their house, and they welcomed me in this time. They let me use their toilet, watch tv, and partay all night. Some rocket launcher spammers came along but they were soon banned, and the partay carried on. At one point, they embedded me into some concrete like Han Solo in Star Wars. But they let me out eventually. They were cool people, and thats rare to find in a game. And then, some guy came along and told me to follow him. So i followed him, and he led me to his house. He told me to be a baby.  I was confused at first, but then he locked the doors, somehow shrunk me, and made me crawl around, typing baby noises in chat, and chilling in a crib he made. It was ♥♥♥♥ing scary. And i really couldnt escape. After a while he took me to town in his car. I could only crawl around the place, so i happily accepted the transport away from that guys creepy♥♥♥♥♥house. Now i just needed to lose this guy (without failing rp). The guy crashed the car, and i snuck off, claiming i was a scared and confused baby. Thats where everything went to♥♥♥♥♥♥ I engaged operation 'Grand Theft Baby', stole a car, a gun, and as my baby self, i hit the road. This pedo guy tried looking for me with his jetpack, but i hit the hills and quietly disconected from the game. This was one ♥♥♥♥ing server. I spent 4 hours on 1 ♥♥♥♥ing server having the creepiest yet most fun time of my life. Not to mention the fact that i went insane from the fact that the house i was stalking had some wierd radio playing a song about tacos on repeat. (at one point it glitched out and amplified like 100 times; my ears bled...)This was ONE ♥♥♥♥ing server. There are other great servers, such as the battlefield-esque dogfighting server, or the knife TDM server. This game is absolutley incredible. Not to mention the incredible options for creativity and modding in single player (addons galore!), and the wonderful destruction physics!This game is a must have if you like RP, multiplayer games in general and creative games. Its incredible fun, i played 9 ♥♥♥♥ing hours on my first day of owning it. I love Blockland, and though it may be dying player wise, its still one hell of a time!Its like Lego, Gmod and Roblox had a baby!Oh yeah, and, for whatever ♥♥♥♥ing reason, you can get an achivment called 'gay pirate' for wearing a pink pirate hat. WTF!?10/10 IGNNo seriously, like 8/10 (its buggy, its dying, but as i said, its a hell of a time!)			"

												The vanilla game may not have a ton to offer, so it all comes down to what the community has to offer (which is a ton). The gameplay makes it a lot like Gmod, except with a more consistant style. Additionally, it's multiplayer architecture makes joining servers with custom content seamless. You'll literally never need to actually install an add-on to play on a server with custom content (with a few exceptions, servers using custom GUI's may want you to install their GUI mods in order to play. This is usually optional anyways.) The gamemode system adds a lot more 'out of the box' fun things to do than the game used to have. But it's still a bit underwhelming and you'll probably only get about a few hours of fun out of it if you refuse to install any add-on gamemodes or other things. Other than a few gamemodes available that are designed to be played in single-player, multiplayer is really where everything is at. There are a number of servers that have been developed for literally years and have a very high quality experience. If you ever really enjoyed Gmod at all, you'll probably find that the most fun servers in Blockland are ones where someone has simply set out a blank slate and a bunch of really neat mods. Shenanigans ensue.It's a game you'll just keep coming back to.Edit: a.			"

												The first online game I ever played. Don't let my measly 120 hours fool you; before this got on Steam, I'd spend so many days after school just playing this, messing around with friends and creating memories that genuinely fill me with tears of joy as I think back on them today.Since I started back in 2009, I've been building, shooting, making videos, mining, and just generally messing around with the multitudes of crazy add-ons that have made the game what it is today. It's definitely not as alive as it used to be, but for what it is now, it's well worth ten bucks. I paid 20 bucks for it and it basically got me to where I am today, shaping my interests and online presence. I've certainly had a blast.			"

												Blockland used to be one of my Favourite games, There were fun map with hidden secrets, The bedroom, The slopes and The kitchen, and you could always get add-ons with  RTB (Return to blockland), an amazing site for finding cool mods. However, Things changed.First of all, Actual maps were removed and only a flat baseplate was left standing. Although there's still structures that you can load up, they're simply no-where near as good as the original maps. This Meant that MP servers were now boring, as most modded gamemodes can't be played. I won't say that the community was ever perfect, it used to be good, but now RTB is abandoned and Blockland servers are basically empty shells of what they used to be. There's also the fact that the blocks that can be used to build are practically LEGO Blocks, which means that even building simple square houses is a tedious process. Overall, Blockland is a true gem lost in time, what used to be a thriving gaming community has become a desolate wasteland and has fallen prey to Money-Hog Developers that can't be bothered to fix their already ruined game.3/10 would not have One of my favourite games ruined again.

												Blockland is my favorite game, and is has been since 2008. The community is creative, and there's hundreds of servers to explore 24/7. Building is a joy, TDMs are responsive, quick, and fun, and exploring other people's servers will keep you entertained for a lifetime. I certainly recommend this game, and so does pretty much everyone I know that has it.			"

												The game is about building anything you can imagine, it's a non-linear sandbox game in which the world is your canvas. Literally a blank canvas.I've played this game since it was in vers. 8. I had the time of my life playing on all the deathmatch and freebuild servers and whatnot.When I discovered addons and mods, I was amazed. People made all sorts of new vehicles, bricks, weapons etc. for the game. I decided I'd download some and try them out.The one addon/mod I really enjoyed was Gamemode_Zombie. It was a L4D-style addon with all the zombie types (boomer, hunter, etc.) There was even a subway map made for it.Now, there was this sort of client within the game called Return to Blockland (RTB). It included a friends list and an addon manager and even a public chat thing where you could talk to anyone that had RTB. It was overall just a neat way to chat with friends and find new addons.But the game has taken a turn for the worse, I am afraid. Not too long ago, RTB was shut down. The friend system was no longer available and the mod downloader/manager was shut down as well. It was much harder to contact friends and see what addons were installed on your game. This made many people upset and the game just sort of died.The game itself, though, had a decent amount of content. There were maps such as Kitchen, The Slopes, and Bedroom that you could explore. Now, these maps weren't made of bricks so that's what made them unique.The V21 update changed this. Maps were replaced by nicer graphics and better shaders,and to make up for the loss of maps we were given an empty slate to build on. The ground and skybox were, or /are/ customizeable with different textures and whatnot.The loss of RTB and the maps has just led to the downfall of this game. The community has turned in to some sort of mix of a Tumblr/♥♥♥♥♥ drama-fest full of feels and oppression where everyone thinks they can flame and argue with each other to solve their problems.I haven't played this game for about 2-3 months because there just isn't anything new or exciting to see and do and, as i stated in the previous paragraph, the community is just downright bad. The servers are low-quality with 99.9% of them being horrid Five Nights at Freddy's RPs and that last .1% being an actual good server with decent admins and choice of addons. (which honestly is hard to find, you should be happy if you actually manage to find or make one.)I can't exactly recommend this game. Once it gets better (which it clearly never will), then maybe I'll change my review.maybe.I give this game a 3/10.TL;DR-------The game was good up until v21.-Maps were awesome and now we just have a blank slate.-There was a good community with a good amount of content.-RTB closed down and everything went bad, especially the community.-FNAF fanboys.-tumblr party-RIP, Blockland.-3/10sorry for the novel of a review.

												-PLEASE READ ALL COMMENTS BELOW-August 8th: Badspot snaps and admits the development is screwed:http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=264261.msg7762181#msg7762181Edit of August 8th: Removed some old data to make room for new dataPlease visit http://www.reddit.com/r/BlocklandIsHorrible after reading this review.""http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?&topic=256488.msg7466927#msg7466927Check out how the guy who made this game describes in detail why he encourages ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ behavior."" - AmadiohaEdit of March 22nd: Someone has made a claim that Badspot has attempted to hire them to gather my personal information -- like home address, work place if applicable, and other things. He also claims that he would have gotten this information through sending me viruses. I worry about the reasoning behind his desire for my personal information.Given that this kind of activity is illegal, I have sent Badspot an email regarding this situation and am currently awaiting his response and see whether or not he denies the accusations. Since the ""hacker"" gave me the information, I have nothing against him and don't plan to take any action against him. I am posting this update because he is ignoring my emails, making him even more suspicious.Edit of March 11th, in response to the developer's desperate attempt at defending himself after making himself look like a clown:Before judging me as a person, please read how the users of Blockland reacted to a disliked user's house being burned down and his cat being killed: http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=181239.0Please ignore the developer's response for now. If you want to know why he is resorting to such low tactics to defend himself, I insist that you read all of the comments below on all pages. I will address the developer's response directly from the comments in order to save space on this review and to prevent people from reading my life story when the review is about Blockland.Edit of March 6th, in response to the developer editing his response in effort to work around his original comment's deletion which was intended to harass me:Eric Hartman (Badspot), has a history of being childish in the way he handles things. He has let children upset him to the point of exposing their personal information and families' information over the internet in an effort to have his community harass them in his defense.While there is only one case that I know of where this has occurred, it is unacceptable and is a violation of that person's privacy rights. Badspot revealed the payment names and email addresses of this user which, I'm pretty sure, is against the law.Here is the ""Drama Dossier"" on a user who has made the mistake of upsetting Badspot: http://badspot.us/Zac-Conover.htmlALL of his communication data which was collected by Badspot through SECURE PAYMENTS and was trusted to him, a man selling his product. How can you explain that? You give a man selling a legitimate product your money and he exposes the information you used on his website because you angered him. Does that sound professional to you? I think not.The question you should be asking yourselves is: Do you want to end up like this guy? If you bother Badspot enough, he'll do the same to you. I have hardly done anything worth being called out for because this man has ignored my existence until the very moment I called him out on the one place he still has a chance to milk money from users with a game he doesn't even take care of.-Edit of February 25th, removed for updated data----- Original Review ----I'll be the first to write a somewhat negative review about this game:First: I started playing this game around 2006-07, prior to Retail Blockland's (the current game) release. This game is almost entirely community-based. This game is what you want to make it, which means the community needs responsible, creative users to help form a fun game for everyone.This has been a problem since the recent removal of maps, which were an easy way to play the game without putting too much effort into it. Currently, the game has a lack of creative players which have caused many, many players to quit the game due to the lack of content from the developer (which he removed maps with a promise of more content, which never came, even a year later), and the lack of decent servers to play on.However, Blockland has always had the problem of a small community which has made decent servers scarce. The lack of maps has left mapmakers without their ability to contribute to Blockland, causing them to leave along with many other players who enjoyed playing on maps rather than the default (and now, the only) map, ""Slate"".I'm not going to lie. I, and many others have felt that the game has been dead (or dying) for a long time now. Even when maps were still here, the game was dying slowly, but surely -- the removal of the maps just kickstarted it because nobody knew how to cope with the lack of creative builders to replace the position that maps once held.Steam, for some of us, is believed to be the last resort for Blockland's future. It's up to you, the newest purchaser who is reading this review, to help reform the community into something better, more active, and more stable.Another problem is that since the maps were removed, many players with low-spec computers were forced to quit due to being unable to process the amount of bricks it would take to create a ""map"".So, if you've got a low-spec PC, I would not recommend this game to you until you get a computer with a decent processor and graphics card. Otherwise, you'll be playing with a constant lag that will drive you to hate the game.The shaders are poorly optimized. (And I mean, they are *extremely* poorly optimized.) So the majority of the Blockland community don't even play with the shaders that we sacrificed our maps for because they can't even run them. Not even high-spec computers can run the shaders with a large amount of bricks unless you've got a ridiculously powerful computer. I've got a quad-core i5 processor and an AMD 7870 Graphics card, 2GB video memory, and I can run Battlefield 3 on max settings with over 60FPS, whereas I have trouble running shaders on max in Blockland and end up only getting around 28-30FPS with builds that are around 50k bricks or more.The gameplay is good as long as you play on a decent server, it depends on your tastes.I'm also going to warn anyone who buys this game: Prepare to be flamed, trolled, or annoyed by the community at some point. The game has one of the most merciless, rude, arrogant communities I have ever been a part of. However, that's not the majority of the community. A lot of the community is very nice and like to take part with each other in building projects or film-making and such. But if you ask me, the community needs an increase in better players.To conclude, we have a lack of a decent, creative playerbase right now and we need more players with more creativity and will to step forward and create something awesome out of this game. Everything in the trailer IS possible, but most of it has never happened and will never happen unless we have more creative players. The trailer was highly exaggerated and the game is far more boring than that. But like I said, everything in the trailer is possible, but it hasn't happened -- yet.So, if you're willing to be a good player and you want to help revive an almost-dead game and form it into a better game for everyone's enjoyment, buy the game. If you don't want to work with the community, hate playing games that take time and effort to make something good out of it, or just generally dislike overhyped games, don't buy it. Even though the game is overexaggerated, it doesn't mean we can't work together to make it that awesome.It's up to you.			"

												I got into Blockland back in 2005 when I was just 11 years old, and back then it was a free game that looked just like Legos, and ever since then, I've seen people and friends come and go, rivalries with other games that were only similar in the concept of 'sandbox game where you can build and destroy anything'.As someone who had practically no social interaction prior, this game and it's community actually helped me grow and mature as a person, I've met so many cool, intelligent, talented and funny people over the years and even became friends with some of them, and it got me in to basic C++ scripting, 3D modeling, audio editing, and even a bit of video making. It is at this point that I feel like I owe my life to this game. Even to this day, I find myself coming back to this game every now and then to build something, to create a new mod, try out someone else's mod, or to just goof about on servers.This game, for me, and several others, is like the 'Hotel California' of video games, you may leave, you may stop playing for a while, but you always come back, for one reason or another. Even those who don't like this game or it's community and get banned for their actions keep spending more of their money just to come back, it's like a drug that you just can't quit!For the 11 years I've been at this game, I've been very active on the message boards, and it's been such an interesting, funny, and unique community over the years, and I've been able to watch it grow and change as time went on, like, I've never been so invested in a community as I am with Blockland's.I do hope that Blockland becomes as popular as games like Roblox, some may disagree with me on this, that they prefer this smaller and more controlled crowd of people, but Blockland really does deserves a bigger audience, it actually is a fun and amazing game. It may be slow and tedious to build something big and amazing, but that's how building is with every sandbox game, ""Rome wasn't built in a day."", and if building isn't your thing, there's just a big variety of gamemodes and servers out there that are PvP death-matches, role playing servers, a boss battle server, knife fights in the sky with grappling hooks, dog fights, single-lap races, multi-lap races-- there's just so many to choose from, you're bound to find something you like!The biggest problem with the game is 'time', what time of the day you get on matters, what time-zone you live in compared to other people matters, what day of the week it is matters, time is a big factor in finding busy and/or good quality servers.While I recommend this game, I also commend checking out the message boards, there you can chillax and talk amongst others that play the game, get help with the game, post pictures of things you built or did, download add-ons or other sorts of mods that people make, or just talk about whatever else, about other video games, or about drawings or other sorts of creative things you or other people do!

												I played this game back when it wasn't on Steam, I was one of those annoying five-years-olds who destroyed other people's stuff. I had a one month membership on this game, and I played it non-stop (most likely over 200 hours total) for the short time I had it. After I ran out of the membership, I went to Roblox (bad idea, big war going on between Blockland and Roblox at that time). After I quit Roblox, I went to Minecraft. Then I (semi)quit Minecraft and went to Steam. After about two years on Steam, I found this game. I had wonderful flashbacks of how me and my cousin would destroy everything, and build it again, then destroy it, again and again and again. My previously mentioned cousin actually bought this game for me (props to you, my friend!) on steam and we played. Although a lot changed, almost to the point where I couldn't recognize it, I still had fun. The new maps were fun, the old maps were still fun, and the whole game had been transformed into a world of small communities and close friends. This is one of my favorite games right now, and I recommend it for my own story, but you should buy this game so you can make your own story, and in a few years, when you are a pro at Blockland, look back at this review and make your own. I know that sounds really cheesy, but seriously, we need to have fun with our games and tell the amazing times and adventures that we have in those games to show people why they should create their own. So, buy this game, right now. Make your own story. Make your own review. Do what I have done, tell others to do so. This is the perfect game for it, so much to do, so much to see. So, what are you waiting for, do it!			"

												The game has unbelievably good gameplay mechanics, and quality, The game also has horrific gameplay mechanics, and quality. The main reason I say that is because of the community.The community is this horrific machine, that says ""Made in America"" on the back, because it's a loud, clunking Chevrolet slowly killing itself as it tries to operate. The entire game is ran be any player with a BL ID (Number you're assigned to, to recognize yourself in-game) that is under  9999. Nowadays, Blockland has around 180000 Players, therefor 180000 BL IDs. Blockland is this nasty 90's High School Cafeteria, and the Forums are the restrooms where people smoke. It has vicious cliques that don't get along with eachother, from the horny teenage anime fans to the eight-year-old FNaF CoD fans. In the game, there are around 40 players that are extremely popular, for no good reason. These people are disquisting little chihuahuas that shake about all day, picking on others. I understand I come across as a six year old when I say this, but Blockland truely is the land of Cyber Bullies. Expecially if you buy the game, for one reason and one reason only - Your BL ID. Blockland is like America, where one batch of immigrants hates the newer ones. Buying the game, for the first 2 days or so, withen buying it, you're the newest player, and everyone can see that. I have seen shiny brand new players permanantly banned for being new. So with this2/10, maybe 3 at it's best. Two years ago.			"

												Played since 2008, was a great game. (GAME FULL OF KIDS, LIKE SERIOUSLY.)The loss of players and the lack of creators updates left it a partly-unfinished game leaving the community to mod their own gamemodes on their own. Yet ruining the game; Not a single update went out until last year, and yet as he says, he declares no more.IF you buy this game, you wont get a whoop load of fantastic fun like you would back in 2009, the forum is nearly dead and the gamestyle is old, I promise it will be a bad experience and a waste of money; He's practically using it to leech his ten bucks every week. Making more SH**TY games, and he wont focus on one large project.Return-To-Blockland began to stop using their free merchandise on blockland, because one of the lucky men keeping it alive was rewarded a promotion elsewere. Ruining the game even more it has less stinctive use and predictament to the game. Since then, thankful for all the modders and their helpful work. Knowingly now that it is a waste of work and it is loosing atleast a player a day.			"

Posted: February 1, 2015
												This game is a good game IF: You put in the time to learn it.  I have put about 5 months into this game outside of steam, and I still love it.  I feel like I can get more out of it the more I play it.I am going to address most of the things the negative reviews are saying about this game. 1.  Minecraft is betterIn this game it is hard to build things that look good, but you can make things in much greater detail than in minecraft.  The building in this game is superior to minecraft's building.  You can build things with dozens of different bricks (not including brick mods) unlike minecraft that just has a standard block with different textures and a few other detail blocks like fences.  Minecraft has a terrible combat system that makes it awful for mini games.  This game has amazing combat elements.  You can do anything in this game in minecraft, but not nearly as well or easily.  Minecraft combat and minigames feel cheap and not very well put together.  I personally hate minecraft, but that does not make it a bad game.     It is a good survival sandbox game, but it ends there.  Anything above that can be done better in so many other games.2.  The developer is awfulWho cares, you are buying the game not the developer.  If you are not on the forums and arn't stealing anyones keys or doing something that would get you banned from any other multiplayer game on steam, you will be fine.  I have never had a problem with the developer at any time.3.  The community is awfulI really have not noticed this outside of the forums, and even so, it is mostly the drama section of the forums that is awful.  It depends on the server you go on of course, but the whole community is not awful.  The bad community in this game consists of the ones that keep complaining about how terrible the developer and community is.  I don't see them doing anything to make it better, they just tick off the developer with their constant complaining which I find makes me angry as well.  I don't even deal with a hundreth as much as the developer does, so excuse him for for being cranky sometimes.If you look for terrible people in a community you will find terrible people in a community.  If you look for awesome people in a community you will find awesome people in a community.4.  Not enough content/game is dyingNot true.  Since this game has been on steam only over a year at the time of this review, the community has more than trippled.  Dying? ok sure.  More people means more mods and servers.  Mods are so easy to install in this game, and it is the only game that I do not find it to be a hassel to do so.  People have modded the game so heavily that it does not even feel like the same game anymore.  This game is fairly dependant on mods, but it has some VERY good mods.5.  Terrain/interriors replaced with shaders and it ruined the gameTerrain and interriors were not all that great.  Like really they were ok for a few servers, but I only used the flat maps and built my own terrain.  They simply were not easy to build on in many cases which happens to be one of the main points of the game.  The shadows and shaders look amazing and are also moddable.  Even if you cannot run them, it does not take away from the game.  There is an environment editing GUI that allows you to edit the lighting, weather, fog, ground texture/color, water level, and other things.  One of the most used maps before the removal of terrain was adjustable plate which was the same thing as the environment edit GUI but not as good.And finally...This game is great if you put the time in to learn it and have friends to play with.  Most of the time I have put into this game I have played without friends, so they are not required to have fun.  There are times when there are not many interesting servers to join, but even then you can just host your own.  Don't listen to those complaining about the community and the dev.  If you like building and or a casual FPS I would highly recommend this game.  There have been times when I did not build for months playing this game, and I just enjoyed the fighting/shooter servers.			"

												I have a sub 800 Blockland ID, not that anyone really cares but I've been with this game for a while. There once was a time I would have suggested this game over Roblox or Minecraft any day of the week, but these days Blockland is so stagnant and pointless with a developer that seems to have just given up and yells at anybody who argues with him that it's just not worth playing anymore. Ever since they removed maps, one of the most memorable parts of this game, all the game has had are 'bug fixes' and a few lighting updates. And that was.. years ago... The building aspect is still there, but it's almost not fun anymore when you can't make a diving board on the top of a house with 50 secret entrances			"

												A great game with endless possibilities. Based on the LEGO system, but so much more than basic building, not only can you build anything you can imagine, but you can also add events like team Deathmatch themed for tons of games like TF2, CoD, and Battlefield, and much more. You can race in a realistic style race or you can set up a Mario Kart style race. Those are just a few examples of the versatility of this game. Also you can make your builds interactive, with lights/emitters to make your builds look great. Blockland is a game anyone who likes to be creative should try.			"

Played since 2007, even before the Steam Greenlight migration happened. Basically, I grew up with this game. I met some good friends in the community. It was good. I'm not sure up until now since the new visual features were added, but still a good game in its core. I've spent a ♥♥♥♥♥on of hours on this game ever since. Now, I think I've grown up from this game, but I think new people can appreciate it as well.RTB (Return to Blockland) was game's greatest community mod API ever. Unfortunately, it was shut down by its creator Ephialtes, due to a majority of its functionality was overrun by Steam's community tools. It's sad, because a majority of good, curated add-ons were on its database. I just hope Badspot (the developer) finds a way to introduce the Steam Workshop to Blockland in order to compensate this.The downside to add-ons recently is that all add-ons are not curated anymore, just scanned for malicious or too-crappy code/content. Nonetheless, some high quality add-ons still exist in the community forums.Disclaimer though,A high percentage of the community is difficult to manage with (considering most are kids at the moment). This can be avoided if you have a lot of patience in communicating with children.Again, due to the most of the community being children, banning was a common act of the developer. There were as well, older people who are apparently trolls who love to spark the fire in the community. Some are it for fun, while some are it for revenge. This is the reason why some people are angry at the developer for cleansing the community of many people.Only a fraction are those excellent to play with and communicate with. Occasionally, you will find a fraction of this community on some servers.			"

												     Before we even get started, some people might say ""Oh, this looks like a Minecraft copy."" but that is incorrect, as it was around way before Minecraft was even thought up of. It's not like Roblox either (Ah the famous Blockland vs Roblox wars...) because of the more solid platform and no subscription. So what is this then? Good question. I think Badspot, the creator of the game, can sum it up quite nicely:""Blockland is an online multiplayer game where you build things with bricks.It's like playing with legos on the internet.""     In my mind, Blockland is one of the best construction/building sandbox games ever made. It is one of my personal favorites that I've played since 2007. I probably have over 600 hours ingame. (Not including Steam) You can do just about anything in this game, from FPS Team Deathmatches to racing to <variable>. Blockland is quite fun by itself, but the real reason you get it is for the high modability. Thousands of community creations keep the game interesting, and populated. Vehicles, weapons, gamemodes, scripts, events, this game has it all for customization. While singleplayer lets you experiment and test, multiplayer is where most people will choose to spend their time. There is always a server up for a specific type of play. (And they usually have good admins)     There is one part where Blockland has an issue...The community is not amazing. (Most of the modders are amazing though) If you go on the official forums you will most likely see tons of hate/spam/garbage/negativity. The moderators do a good job of clearing out the useless and hurtful stuff, but I feel as if its always been like this. If you are like me, you really don't let it get to you; but I can see how it might be unacceptable to others.     Other than this (really) small issue, I completely and fully recommend Blockland to anybody that is even slightly interested in sandbox games or being creative.10/10			"

Want to play a FPS with iron sights ✔, want to play the same thing with BF2 style rules and vehicles ✔, want to play that some thing but with destructable buildings and terrain ✔, want to play CTF instead ✔, want to race instead of that ✔, want to race with sharks in the water on user made maps ✔, want to play jailbreak ✔, want to say ♥♥♥♥ all that and just build and mine like a boss ✔, do want to do all this with HD graphics ✔✔✔✔✔.This game is awesome and worth every digital red cent. I don't think you could get bored with this game if you enjoy having fun. Huge community submitting content, single player and multiplayer options with LAN ability. There really is something for everyone here.If you need it, I would compare this game to a Garry's Mod but in the Lego universe x{. There I made a comparison.10 out of 10 in Graphics, Replay Value, Multiplayer Support, Single Player, and every other applicable category.			"

												I think a lot of the reviews compared it what it used to be. However, I got it pretty recently (within the past 3 months) and I think it's pretty good. The building and overall gameplay took me a while to get used to it, but it plays fairly easily after that. The building system is a bit annoying, but you get used to it. The game modes are pretty good, but most of them are optimized for multiplayer. Speaking of multiplayer, the overall amount of servers and activity is decent. There are a lot of servers with varying game modes. The community seems OK from what I've seen on the forums, so no complaint there. However, I wish this game had Workshop support and more updates. Even though there is no Workshop, mods are pretty easy to download, but since Return to Blockland was discontinued they are a bit harder to get to work. Overall, I'd recommend it with a 7.5/10			"

												Don't get this game unless you want to play in a dieing game.Now, don't get me wrong, i play this game EVERY day, and i love it, but to be honest, It's dying, according to many other players.One of my friends was banned from the forums for asking the DEVELOPER for news on updates, and the notice was ""♥♥♥♥ You, I Don't Owe You Anything"". And she PAYED for the game. That's the DEVELOPER saying ""Hah, you bought my game, but ♥♥♥♥ off."" And, i'll probably be replied by the developer or something or my comment removed, but atleast someone might see this.It's a fun game, but the community is starting to turn very nasty. Very little original gamers play anymore, me being one of the few. And, the only reason why the developer still does tiny tweaks every few months or so is because ""It makes me too much money to stop."" Don't get the game unless you plan to play in a dying game. Im also probably will get banned or something, or i wouldn't be surprised.			"

												PROS:-Graphics: Graphics are quite nice. The bricks are very accurate to real life. Plus there are shaders.-Eventing: You can program your bricks to appear/disappear, shoot a rocket, or you could build an entire computer!-Bots: Comes with fully programmable bots. You can make them kill you, or fight for you.CONS:-Addons: You needs loads of addons to do anything really cool, or to get people to join your server.-RTB: Return to Blockland was a great addon system with advanced features and IRC, and it no longer exists.-Eventing: The event interface is nice for beginners, but once you start making more complex things, it becomes quite cumbersome.-Lack of updates: The developer is inactive most of the time. Don't expect anything more to come out of this.-Vehicle physics: Vehicles glitch through walls/floor, especially flying ones.-Controls: Sometimes they are quite hard for beginners to learn, mostly building. If you don't have a number pad, this can become quite difficult.Yep, that's my take on the game. It really has the potential; but it just wasn't executed right.			"

												Ok, before you start dissing me on this, let me just say a few things:1. Just because RTB's service was shutdown, it does NOT mean the game is ruined. You can still get addons off of mirrors, and some addons even have a new IRC/addons manager. You can even still use the old RTB client for managing your addons as well, just not downloading them.2. Badspot is not saying the community is the problem. He is saying that it is a specific age group, and he can not control all of them. They host their own servers, with their own rules. Don't get mad if one of them happens to ban you for acting annoying to them or others, or you don't read their rules.3. When you think of the community, you're probably thinking of the forums. Let me just say, that you're probably browsing the Off-Topic section and just saying that's not normal. Please note, you are looking in the OFF-TOPIC section. Most Blockland related things are in the Blockland, Files, and Modification Help sections.Alright, now to the review.This game is a load of fun, mainly because you can honestly do whatever you want. You can build a house, make a sprite from a game in blocks, have a deathmatch with some friends, it's almost ALL customizable.There's also addons you can download to add new blocks, events, weapons, tools, and other things to the game. A example of a new way to play is Unlimited Mining, which is exactly what it says on the tin: Mining that can stretch forever. It may seem boring, but it's not just the same ores. The deeper you dig, the closer you get to the Core, which has more valuable and radiated ores. and then, there's the secret area above grounds, that's very difficult to find...The multiplayer's fun as well, you just need to be careful on what servers you go on, and read their rules carefully. Some people don't seem to get this, and end up joining random servers, get banned, and get all flustered wondering what they did wrong. People have their own rules, and others might not want you on your server.And finally, there's the downtime. Normally, this isn't our fault. It's a problem with a few other people, like BDX, or Man of Reason, DDoSing the server when they feel like it, causing the master server and forums to go down. The master server is how you are able to see the server list. If that's down, you probably won't be able to join any servers.Even though this game may seem off due to bad reviews, this game is what helped me finally play with others and have some fun. It was fun in 2008, and it's fun now. Try buying it while it's on sale, when it ever does, so you can spend less to try it. Even better, you can download the demo here: http://blockland.us/Download.htmlYou'll have to buy the game in order to play past the block limit, but trust me, it's much better when you're not limited.

												I originally began playing Blockland at a young age back when there was a demo of only 150 bricks. I had become separated from Blockland for a number of years, but then found it on Steam. This surprised me! I had to get the full version! The promo video on the Store Page made the game look amazing! Unfortunately, the game isn't as good as I remembered. There has been updates and my favorite by far is the Kart Racing, but I find it hard to stay interested.			"

												It's an OK game, save for the developer that really doesn't care about the game at all. But the harsh reality is that nobody plays it (there's usually only one server online with around 16 people), and the people who still do are mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. It makes enjoying the online multiplayer quite hard. There's practically no saving it as everyone who first bought it on Steam mostly abandoned it before reaching 5 hours playtime. Steam would have been the best way to save this game, but every new person that bought it didn't even care to return to it.The only way I can recommend this game is if either:You are really interested in playing this type of gameorYou have a group of friends willing to play with you (that won't abandon the game after playing it once)It's an OK game at best that still fills a niche that many other games don't really fill that well, if you're into it. Don't expect much from the developer, and the community is basically doomed from a bad steam release.			"

												I love this game.No, let me rephrase that.I loveD this game.This game used to be great. There were many custom maps to explore, and lots of community gamemodes to play. There was always a lot of people to play with and the community was generally awesome. Did you notice any thing about those last sentences? One; Everything I listed was community-made. The developer's actual content is not very interesting to play with for more than a few hours. Two; It was past tense. Maps were actually REMOVED from the game for no good reason and a good portion of the community left due to that. And then RTB stopped. RTB, or Return to Blockland, was a mod for Blockland which worked as a mod manager and also friends list. RTB was awesome and was the only thing anyone used to keep track of friends and get mods. And then, one day, RTB was gone. The servers were down and you couldn't download it anymore. That caused a large portion of to leave the game and now we're left with the remains of a once amazing game, barely managing to keep enough players.You could buy this game as it is. I wouldn't blame you. This game is still good, if only for a day or two. But if you do buy this don't get it on steam, and get this (free) version to go along with it: https://github.com/portify/blockland-20DISCLAIMER: You cannot use this without owning Blockland, and even if you could, I would not endorse doing so without a purchase. If you run a server on the main master server of Blockland using this version, your account may be terminated. You cannot use this with the steam version of Blockland because steam users do not have keys.			"

Plenty of role play servers for those type and freebuild servers for those who do not like to be restricted to various rules. What you don't understand is this game has no limit to what you want to create. You can litterly build a RPG server like one of those free mmos you find on steam that suck. And no its not  minecraft 2.0 because it came out years before This game has a lot of freedom and is totally sandbox if you wish it to be that way. You can create anything you want within it so I really reccomend it.			"

												A true classic of a game. A wonderful game released in 2007, before any game with pixel art or blocks was a ""CRAPPY MINECRAFT CLONE XDDD""and before Minecraft or Terraria even existed. This was just a simple game that was spread by mouth, gifted to friends, enjoyed all the time, and, of course, was incredibly fun. It still is! It's definitely worth the 10 bucks, and if you're too worried about spending that, just go ahead and pick it up when it's on sale! It's a classic game that is also a BLAST with friends.			"

												The game is very fun and interesting, and building in a lego world has endless possibilities. The game also has a lot of add-ons and modifications.However, the worst part of Blockland is the community. Just go to http://forum.blockland.us and see how horrible it is for youself. It's basically a group of users who argue a lot and spend more time on the forums than playing the actual game. Development is also deteriorating. Version 21, which was released in August 2012, was the last major update to the game. It was supposed to make it easier to add more features in the future, but a major update has not been released yet. Blockland also uses a 15-year-old game engine and this causes a lot of problems for add-on makers, such as glitchy vehicle physics and limitations on projectile speed.In conclusion: great gameplay and originality, but horrible community and slow development.EDIT: Yesterday, Heedicalking, a notable member of the Blockland community peacefully protested against the lack of the new features (which were promised exactly 2 years ago). Badspot, the owner of the game, deleted his posts and banned him on three accounts: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54466069/banned.png "

												My son nagged me to get this game.  We have loaded it and it does not work on a Mac.  What really bugs me is that I have been looking on line and this problem has been known for several years without any solution as far as I can tell but the game is still being sold as Mac compatible.  You will get a warning about preferences.  This warning basically means that you can't save many of the changes in the game.  People who played the game without steam first can copy files across to fix it, but this is not an option open to those who don't.  Frankly I do not think that something should be conisdered saleable if you have to start changing preferences on individual files and loading code to make it work.Very very poor which is a pity because everything I read about the gaem itself suggests that it is a great game when it works.

Now i won't drone on about the old days of this entertaining game, but i'd love to see this game be revived and the problems listed fixed.

												Although I do still find the game entertaining from time to time, I would not recommend it now for other users. Here are the reasons why:The in-game servers and content don't have the same variety or atmosphere as they had when I first bought the game 3 or 4 years ago. Although that could just be nostalgia talking, that is, of course, something that drastically affects my relationship and experience with the game.The engine isn't at all the best (After all, it's more than a decade old. To be more frank, the game engine is virtually ancient.), which puts some signifcant limitations on modders, despite the admittedly incredulous amount of flexibility and ease of the add-on system.Although there are some good-looking shaders, they are not well-optimised, and were put into the game hastily at the cost of the mapping system that the game had, at the dismay of many players.The creator of the game, Badspot, has shown little to no interest in actively participating in enriching Blockland's community and playability, and although he does argue that the players are very much capable of expanding the enjoyment of the game, the players alone are not as impactful as an update from the creator of the game that would allow more capacity to do what you want with the game, regardless of the level of quality and initiative of the said community at hand.Although that's all I could think of right now, I will add more of my gripes and arguments about this game in later edits, and maybe even possibly completely rewrite this review. Like I said earlier, it's not as fun and filled with variety in user-generated content as it was before, which could very well say something about the community. I have been playing far before the game even was greenlighted on Steam, and have witnessed the transformation of this game overtime. If the developer of the game or other members of the community would like to talk to me about this review, or perhaps get feedback from me on my opinion on how to improve the game, you are more than welcome to. Thanks for reading.			"

												It's a fun time sink of a game, unfortunatly what drove me orignally to the game was it's great community. A few years ago we were like a little family, all the regulars knew each other and all helped out together, but trying to play on any server nowadays leads to saddness feeling like we've lost the game, don't play it for the comunity. The final straw was the v21 update; all yall  young whipper snappers don't know the pain from the death of the terrain. It was truly tragic for most players, we traded off brilliant 3d maps with hills and terrains for what? shaders that probably still totally suck, brick collisions with both vehicals and entities are garbage, kiling off some of the more popular servers. It's been a while since of played but I seriously doubt anything has changed.If you do just like legos and building things, this is the game for you.----EDIT----Since some♥♥♥♥♥hat couldnt interpret that I played the game before steam, given my .7 hours play time and the fact that I said I played while there was terrain, while also complimenting(?) my grammar, I just need to point out that I have put thousands of hours into this game, I started playing around june of 2011. dunno if ID's are still a thing, but look up 30927. the name SHOULD be TestZombie, unless one of my dumb-as-nails siblings changed it when i forgot to log off steam once.----EDIT----Thinking about what this game used to be litterally gives me depression. It's like the original TEEN TITANS series compared to Teen Titans Go; except instead of TTG its actually just a 15 minute video of a dog Taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥then being hit by a train.OH and what I edited to say was - apparently mods don't even exist for the game now that it has been green lit to steam, this was practiaclly Lego Gary's Mod except 100x better than the 2 of them combined, so the terrain death update shortly followed by Steam destroyed the very small glimmer of hope that could possibly have still existed for this game. Honestly, I think the game is false advertising when it uses Tenski's Blockland trailer which exclusevly showed mods made by the comunity.Also I don't know where, but I heard a rumor fairly recently that RTB (a beautiful mod, the mother of all mods, a mod that allowed players to have Friends (obviously this part deppreciated by steam) and also group chats and a beautifull IRC with several mods and bots at all times, it was a mod and (before that solely) a website that allowed people to create and share mods to be downloaded easily in game or manually; I heard that it may be coming back, it's not enough to save; scratch that, resurect this game, but with dedication that I don't believe exists anymore,			"

												TL;DR, the community is dead but the game would be really ♥♥♥♥ing good if people got back on itI'll be honest, back when I got this game a few years before it got greenlit the community was really thriving in comparison to how it's like today. A part of me even thinks that the greenlight was only done to try and garner new players, which obviously didn't work out much at all.Blockland isn't like Minecraft or Roblox, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Blockland is a lego-style sandbox that (in my eyes) is a nice blend between the game mechanics that Minecraft and Roblox have to offer. You don't need to be an expert in some external first-party program to build great games, (Like Roblox) and you don't need to build massive contraptions to give your basic blocky world some life and functionality. (Like Minecraft) You are already given all the base tools you need to build things like RPGs, deathmatch arenas, cities, race tracks, whatever you want.The community is less than to be desired, I'll be the first to admit. But it's not like any game community is perfect, you'll always have trolls and kids trying to mess with you or other players, but that's in the spirit of the freedom that these kinds of games will bring. With the community pretty much washed out at this point, I'd say some sort of revival, a ""renaissance"" if you will, would make it blossom into the large and creative community we saw back in it's golden days.If you're new to the game, I recommend getting it during a steam sale in case you aren't satisfied. If you happen to know what Blockland was like but haven't gotten it yet, €10 is a small price to pay in my opinion.Gameplay - 9/10- Minigames - 8/10- Building - 10/10- Multiplayer - 9/10Community - 5.5/10- Old: 8/10- Current: 3/10			"

Most builds on servers are pretty poorly built (but that's okay, we have to start somewhere).+ The game still functions, still has some people playing.

												I think this game has gone downhill for a while. I remember when I first played it in 2010 and it was pretty decent I guess. There was a good stream of updates now and then and the game was actually enjoyable. But now I have no idea where it's gone to. The community of the game really drags it down for me, and since this game is almost 90% based on multiplayer, it might affect you too. The community is not forgiving at all so if you do something wrong/bad you will still be bashed for it years later. The community loves to accuse you of doing things that you never did, such as conducting a denial of service attack. Nowadays, the creator barely pushes out updates and there hasn't been any meaningful updates for what seems to be an eternity. The creator of the game also is censoring people's negative reviews and banning them from discussions for peacefully expressing their opinions both on Steam and the Blockland Forums (by the way, if you're going to play the game, never join the Blockland Forums for sure. I can't tell you how screwed up that place is). The game is, from time to time, enjoyable when you find a good server that is fun and has no hostile/bashing people on it. But otherwise I think this game has really gotten worse since my first purchase of it in 2010. You choose if you want the game and are willing to completely ignore the community. I don't suggest you play it if you want to play on multiplayer a lot. The community is small and everybody can quickly know who you are and attack you for the rest of your stay if you screw up a few times.Also there's the ""screw-up recurrence"" game. You screw up and you know what you did was dumb. But the community keeps attacking you so you intentionally fight back and then at that point you're marked as a ""problem user"" and immediately banned from all game discussions. So if you like to express your opinions without censorship regarding the game, this is not the place to do it.Yeah my review will probably be censored since i'm marked as a ""problem"" user but what can I say? You choose if you can ignore a hostile/corrupted/censoring community and creator where people actually think you can mark an ""opinion"" as wrong. If you can, sure, play the game all you want and maybe you'll enjoy it. If you don't think you can, you might not want to try this game. I think this game is pretty good but the community/creator is bad. That's just my personal opinion, you can try the game and see if you like it. I mean it has events, vehicles, add-ons, weapons and a bunch of cool stuff but the community / creator drag it down for me so you can choose if it matters to you.*UPDATE 8/7/2014*The creator also has censored posts / banned people from the official game forum. The posts were constructive criticism (not intended to insult or flame in any way) which expressed disappointment due to the lack of meaningful updates and unmet promises of the developers. The community member who has most recently been affected by this is Heedicalking, a well known community member who is known for making good servers (frequently team deathmatch servers).He expressed his disappointment in the lack of development in a constructive and respectful way but he was banned twice and his posts were censored (deleted).Here is a backup of the censored posts (they are written by Whitebeard and SHU-YA)http://blocklandcloud.com/20140807-heedicalking-deleted-posts/ http://blocklandcloud.com/20140807-heedicalking-deleted-posts2/ "

												Against all my instincts I bought this game. What I was faced with was instant regret and $10 less than I had beforehand. I am a very picky customer and I VERY rarely buy games but when I was told this game was like garrysmod meets legos I thought, okay maybe I'll give this a shot. What I was faced with was horrifying. I started up the game, went to create my character and was faced with the saddest excuse for a character creation system ever. It was so poorly designed and shallow that many would confuse that monstrosity for the work of ljn. This game is so poorly designed and it seems to be aimed towards children 6 to 10. It was a fair attempt but it just falls flat in my opinion. The video samples of the game were convincing so I thought maybe that the gameplay could be redeeming. After a painstakingly long loading screen, I was faced with terrible gameplay, no voice chat options and a painful amount of little kids. Among this little kids were ""Pizza Man"", ""Buttman"", and ""Awesome Guy"". This game has made me question everything I once held as holy. Please, NEVER buy this horrible, horrible game because all that awaits you is immediate disappointment. After I finish this review I am instantly deleting this garbage. It isn't worth the 50 MB it takes up. If anyone needs me I'll be weeping over the loss of my $10. I would buy this MAYBE for $2 but I would have to be in a REALLY bad way to resort to this game. Stick to flash games over this. They are free, you won't get burned, and you won't have the feeling of looming stupidity that I am currently experiencing. Spend your money on gum instead, a lot of gum. You will get more use out of it.			"

												The game was good for its time but there are better things available now. I wouldn't reccomend picking up Blockland as the developer has essentially stopped working on the product.Minecraft is a much more adventure-based sandbox game with a lively modding community and is suitable for younger players (including children), but doesn't lose its appeal on adults.Space Engineers is (as of writing) an early access game for building your own space craft. Its building system feels like Blockland, but it's backed by a very cool physics engine. More suitable for older players and adults, especially if you're interested in realism and engineering based sandbox games.Blockland was a game I played for quite some time, but it hasn't aged well and has been usurped by newer and better things.

												One of the best games I've ever played, personally. The community is horrible at times, and extremely helpful at others. I started the game a while ago, then stopped playing it for a bit (I got bored of it). Then, I came back a year later, seeing no maps, and got slightly angry for a few days, and then got over it to see what it'd become. Bad, good, decent, hilarious, pathetic; Those were all going through my head as I relearned Blockland, although this time, I learned something new - Events. Eventing in Blockland is personally my favorite part (followed closely by the capability of them, and what you can make out of them). I still have a weekly rage session, just because some stupid thing happened in-game, but I don't mind. It's still among my favorite games. (Although something I don't like is the amount of roleplay in the game - specifically FNAF roleplay...)			"

												This is easily one of my most played games of all time. You can pretty much do anything you want in this lego building environment, and in terms of it's building mechanics, you will find none better than Blockland. There is also an incredibly large amount of player-made resources and mods to expand the gameplay to pretty much anything you can think of. Stop playing games that limit you to building with one size blocks and play a game that truly gave many the best gaming experiences they've ever had. Also while you're at that, check out my blockland videos on my Youtube channel!youtube.com/sirherg1 "

												Well... It's interesting.I can see some people's issues with there not being enough parts, but the fact that you can make (or download) parts and toss them into an Add-Ons folder kinda gets rid of that complaint.  I think the biggest failing is the fact that the tutorial is REALLY basic, expecially where the wrench is concerned.  This game looks to be extremely powerful, but withot utilizing that power it's kind of like Superman having to remain Clark Kent because the world is made of Kryptonite.Now, that aside, I'm seeing a pretty nice game here.  The block selection is done fairly well, allowing you to customize your quick-bars to whatever parts you wish to use.  In addition you use the mouse to begin placement of a block, but then use the numberpad to fine-tune that placement.  This is great in a 3D environment, as it truly gives you easy control of your building.  It even goes so far to, when placing something wrong, tell you exactly why the placement was rejected (overlapping, etc).  Finally, there are enough DEMO worlds in this game that you can truly see all of the possibilities you can get into (as long as you know how the wrench works).When it all comes down to it, do I recommend people play this game?  Yes I do.  THAT SAID, continue reading...I do recommend people play this game, however I only recommend BUYING the game if you can get it at a reduced price like I did.  I got this game as part of a $2.99 bundle on Bundle Stars, and for that price this game is well worth the money.  Would I pay $10+ for it?  Absolutely not, because it doesn't have a strong dev team behind it, the developer has a really bad attitude, and I doubt it'll ever be ""finished"".  The most I'd ever pay is $2.99 for this game by itself...  That's a lot, considering I'm expecting the developer to see a lawsuit by Lego in the future.			"

												Blockland is a sandbox game in LEGO style. BTW how did they manage the licence problem? Blockland has a long history with an included social media platform and earlier IRC chats. I have heard of uncountable user maps that have exist. The hope is that on steam this project will be revived. There are several new game servers and now you're able to communicate over steam.The graphics are average. For good example there's a fog of distance. But it is comfortable on the other side to play it just in window mode if you want. You can choose different game modes like car races or battle arena or free building. Blockland's strength is the huge library of existing models and build parts. It's easy to set spawn points for zombies or equip weapons to your character.Tough there are other LEGO style or Minecraft style games out there, like Ace of Spades, but i think Blockland is a tryout worth.

												Started this game back in 2007ish when I was very young, I love it. You can do a multitude of things from building, shooting, driving, and many more things. The addons you can acquire make the game fifty times better and they add more possibilties than the default vanilla game. The shadows and shaders replaced maps back in 2012, which I think was very bad idea; a lot of the fun things are no longer there, like skiing on The Slopes map. The community is also very garbage; I steer as far as possible from the forums (besides the addon section), especially the drama section.All in all, have friends to play with, get tons of addons, stay away from 95% of the community, and have some fun.

												This game, this game right here is really, really awesome! It's like playing with legos, on the computer, and you don't have to buy the said legos. This game is what I have played a lot, just like another game I've played a lot. If you love legos, and are too lazy to get the money to buy real legos, then this game is for you. And one of the awesome things is that you can host your own server if you wanted, and addons are really easy to install. I recommend this game to people who have someform of creativity and loves legos. Just becarful when exploring the server list, there are some strange servers out there... not saying all of the servers are bad, just some of those servers could cause you to lose your sanity being there. I happen to host a server, though I don't get very many players thanks to certaint people who shan't be named for reasons that I will not tell you about. Though there can be some downsides to this game, it tends to cause weaker computers to crash, which is annoying since I have a horrable computer, but if you know what you're doing, and keep the addon count small, you'll be fine with hosting a server, and don't be afraid to ban people, they break the rules on your server, so it gives you the full right to ban them. And there are other people who complan about how bad the server is, and here's a little tip when dealing with them, simply tell them this ""My server, my rules. If you got a problem with this, then get off of my server."" and then ban them if they do not stop, and if you don't want them returning day after day, calling you some very rude, and stupid, names, then perma ban them, like I said, it's your server, you decide how it works, if people don't like it, then they don't like it. You can't change that. And be sure to be a very kind person so people like you, if you do that, more and more people will show up on your server. These are my words of wisdom for hosting a server, I'd share my wisdom on how to not be banned on other servers within five seconds, but I do not have time for that today. Good luck, my good people, you're going to need it. Also, check out my some of my guides for Blockland, I only have one at the moment, but feel free to check them out!			"

												This is Blockland, the game that introduced me to the Internet, Memes, and lots of other things. I decided to do a review, since it was 10 years since the retail version of Blockland came out.It was also 10 years since I played it for the first time.This isn't the Blockland I grew up in.. The Blockland I grew up in was back in 2007-2012 where it was in it's glory days.Blockland started out as quite a small community, but it was a good community, a community where if you go and look for a server, there wouldn't be an empty server, and of course not to forget that it had lots and lots of add-ons made by many people.Now here is where I talk about the maps, if you're a completely new player in Blockland, then you probably won't know what I'm talking about.Back then maps in Blockland were unseperable, it was a known feature of Blockland where it kinda made the game unique.Coming with the game, you would have a good amount of maps that you can choose from, and if you wanted, you also could've added custom maps to the game, and there were LOTS of maps, ranging from interiors to terrain maps, ranging from full cities to whatever's imaginable. It wasn't like right now where it gives you ONLY slates.As Blockland progressed in the years, it started releasing more and more updates, and more and more people started to join as well, then RTB got introduced, RTB is an add-on that lets you download add-ons without going in to the forums and manually installing them. That add-on installs add-ons while you're IN the game, and put them automatically in to the add-ons folder. This thing blew up, so many people downloaded this amazing add-on, and using it was comfortable.At this point in time, the game was getting bigger but the community was still creative and friendly as always.The game got updates along the way, Renderman was added (A Blockland version of Slenderman) in Halloween..And then...Update V21 was released.This update is what killed the majority of the community, and again, if you don't know let me explain that to you.As we all know Blockland had maps, but those maps were an unseperable part from the community. Every player in Blockland played in those maps, and gained a connection to them.When that update came out, most people just decided to quit the game all together, As that update removed all the maps, and now all you got is a customizable slate, shaders, and a Day Night cycle, and maybe a few gamemodes that were added.That's it.Then the game was released on Steam where it got more people in to the game, but they were a threat to the community as they were trolls that enjoyed ruining people's fun in the servers, from what I've been hearingAfter a long time when the game was on steam, RTB was hacked and shut down, which made even more people quit.And now, as far as I know, nothing is left but a small number of players, empty servers, and a memory of lost community.Imagine if they hadn't have removed the maps for those pesky shaders, Day Night cycles and customizable slates.If only they had done a better job as including them all together, who knows what we would have today?The same community as ever but larger. Maybe?We can't know for certain.This my review, I recommend Blockland, but not THIS Blockland. The Blockland from the old days.			"

												WARNING!!! THIS GAME HAS ONE OF THE WORST COMMUNITIES EVER!This has got to be one of the best sandbox games I have ever played. I bought it back in 2009 and have been playing it ever since. When I moved my game from the standard launcher to Steam, my friends asked about it. I recommended this game to them, and now, to you unsure buyers. Let's start with what you can do.1. Build massive structures with a block limit of 256000 blocks2. Drive around in a set amount of vehicles with rather good handling3. Kill zombies, animals, and bots4. Paint blocks to create art5. Add effects and lights to bricks to make an already impressive structure look better6. Mods! Make your game WAY better with more bricks, weapons, vehicles, paint, decals, etc!7. Build signs out of individual bricks8. Be a better person than anybody in the community9. Build and fight with your friends and other players10. Customize your character with different faces, body decals, and even a few hats.AND MUCH MORE!TL;DRThis game is incredible, but has a terrible community.			"

												Blockland did go downhill when it went onto steam, I've had blockland forever I was one of the first 500 people or less to get the game. My old computer died and I lost my Blockland I.D with it, but when it came onto steam I saw it and of course got it again. I put quite a few hours onto the game, but I don't know what happened..I guess it got old or was it the lact of  maturity in the community? The mods aren't as good as they used to be but there are fun game modes that kept me occupied for a while. Maybe it's simply just because I got older, I've gotten more into serious Rping on Gmod but who knows I may get old of that and go back to Blockland, but for now It's been fun I may come back to play. I hope you more fun playing this game.			"

												Blockland has a bit of a history. In 2005, it was a little work-in-progress building game on the Torque Game Engine. Being an alpha, it had (here comes a massive understatement) quite a few mods that generated a larger following. The full game released in 2007, and much more polished than anything seen before. Streams of updates from the game's sole creator (with some collaboration thrown in) in the past six years have created a unique game that nothing can hope to come close to.So, what's the main point? Blockland is That Game Where You Build Stuff. It's all on you, and the community. Using LEGO-like blocks to create structures in online multiplayer may sound mundane on paper, but the online part is where it really shines. The amount of creativity Blockland players have is nothing short of amazing. User-created add-ons like weapons and vehicles are plentiful, allowing for different and fun gamemodes within buildings YOU create, and an ""events"" system gives way for even more creativity within builds.An accessible sandbox game for such a price is almost a steal.

Vehicles, weapons, gamemodes, ect. You just need the talent.If you're a content creator, there's definently a lot to enjoy here. If you're just here to try and find good servers to play on, you are probably not going to have much to come back to.			"

This is one of the games I will look back on a long way down the line and think ""This was something special""The graphics may not be the best, but for an old game engine it sure does impress me. The quality of servers are great, the game is community driven via mods, and it is always alive and brimming.Blockland is just getting started, so pick up a copy and experience some amazing moments that will stay with you forever			"

												Blockland is a wonderful game, with a huge variety of things you can do. From building cool structures to playing TDMs to role playing, Blockland brings hours of fun if you enjoy games like Roblox or Minecraft. The community is very small, so if you want servers where you play with hundreds of people at a time then this isn't for you, however it's still worth a try to test out the Demo of the game --->http://blockland.us/Download.html<--- because it could turn into something you didn't expect.

												I've had this game since 2010, and in my opinion, this is the best blocky sandbox game ever, and one of the best sandboxes out there. It was in developement before Minecraft(around 2005) so don't even try to compare these two.You can do almost everything here - build tons of stuff using easy build method with endless blocks, then invite your friends and build something together! Or shoot each other for fun! What makes it even more better is add-ons - install ReturnToBlockland IMMEDIATELY after you have played a bit and know how things work - it is a built-in-game overlay to chat with people and download many add-ons which enhance gameplay.This game is definately worth your time and money.

												I cannot reccomend this game enough I have played countless hours of this game before it was even ever on steam. It just has so much to do and build in this game. I mostly just loved this game because It's pretty much infinite amounts of legos and more to mess around with. Think of Gmod but with legos thats what this game is, and it is great.			"

												First and foremost, this is NOT another minecraft gameBlockland is a Garry's mod meet Legos meets [Insert anything here]Like garry's mod in the way that you make it what you want it to be, be it an adventure RPG, Modern day RP or perhaps a zombie survival Left 4 Dead.At least around 400-800 people are playing blockland at any given time, so it's far from dead, my only complaint is that Badspot (The dev) removed premade maps from the game, meaning any terrian you want to have you have to build yourself or download it from someone else.The game runs smoothly on most PCs so don't worry about your system specs and is a game i recommend to anyone who enjoys Garry's mod and or Legos, this game is a dream come true for me, hell, i even used to host the most popular medieval-rp server back in 2012.Also, you're not limited to being a block person, you're able to play as any NPC or rigged vehicle, meaning playable dragon characters which you can customize with different colors, tanks, horses.ect (Yes peole can ride you)Now when i said it's like Garry's mod meets Legos, i ment just that, in Garry's mod you have to download addons made by the community, which you can do ingame easily without any hassle, it's as simple as searching for a mod and click download.Currently there's a massive amount of addons available from dragons, flintlock weapons, lasers, lego weapons, LOADS OF VEHICLES OH GOD, and gamemodes, not to mention custom builds like giant fantasy castles and what-not.So to anyone who is unsure about the game or is turned off my the fact that there are blocks.This /is/ a Garry's mod game, with Legos, and quite frankly i LOVE legos.(PS, playable dragons and Hydralisk(StarCraft) characters are a massive upgrade from Garry's mod in my eyes, and considering how easy it is to create your own mods it's definitely worth picking up for those who have talent with Blender)			"

												Blockland is a great game, in my opinion.I know that most of the veteran community disappeared, due to the update (v21) which removed maps, and terrain. It was devastating for them. But new players may not understand how maps and terrain meant everything to them.The developer (Eric ""Badspot"" Hartman) has given up on the game, and pretty much wrenched it on Steam as a last-ditch attempt to squeeze out some more money of the players. I believe the community have pressured Badspot too much. Take notice of my forum post: https://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=308505.0 Another thing: Barely anyone plays Blockland anymore. Back in 2009, 2010, or 2011, you would find thousands of servers and people on at once. The last time that happened when thousands were online, was on Thursday, June 26th 2014. 1843 people were online then. It went down over the next few days, but that was about it. If you want to know how much servers there were, guess what. On the exact same day there were so many players, there was 600 servers online. Not kidding. 2014 was the only peak high year that Blockland had post-map-terrain-update. Nowadays, there's only 100 servers! 500 servers less than it was in 2014.Blockland was born in late-2003, and was created using a 14-year old game engine: Torque Engine. If you want to create addons, you'll have to learn TorqueScript and some Blender. I'm not gonna lie, most players have created some *really cool* content, if you look in the trailer. Although, not really anyone hosts these cities or whatever anymore.Blockland is barely updated anymore, so don't expect updates. Badspot only does REALLY tiny updates, and I really mean really tiny updates. If you want to see it for yourself, check it out here: https://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=302905.0As you can see, there were only 3 or 4 fixes.The community is pretty alive and well, but most of the new community are just unpleasant. Take a look at this locked post, for example: https://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=308380.0What the he-- https://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=306053.0 --*BLEEEEEEP*If you are a fan of sandbox games with a Lego-style to it, then Blockland is for you. If you're not a fan of 14-year old game engines, it's not for you.			"

												I have been on Blockland for around 4.5 years, and is still not even near old. Every time I turn it on, there's always something to do, if you have a creative mind, this game is perfect for you. You can make nearly anything, houses, citys, spaceships, e.t.c. Even though the game comes with some default items, bricks e.t.c, there is a giant bunch of add-ons you can add to the game, to make it even more fun. Even though the loss of interiors and terrain has happened, the game is still as fun as ever. Blockland also has an event system, where you can make stuff happen, like make bricks dissapear, have them change color, and with Event add-ons, that's even fun too. The price used to be £18, and I think the game is worth it, and now, it's £7, so now you can have the same fun, for a good price, I am not even the tinyest bit annoyed about how I had to pay £17 and not £7, as Badspot (the creator) fully deserves it. I'm sorry for the giant review, but that's just how great and fun this game is. I could never understand how people can not like this game, as it's packed with a ton of stuff to do. I'd recommend this to everyone.			"

												Just a minecraft rip-off you say? Never! This game is more than meets the eye, and whilst is unmistakably similar to the chart top, award winning phenomenon that is mine craft, it is very much its own ticket. Blockland is like all the fun parts of minecraft put at your feet, with all the incentive to accompany it and more. It’s more of a thrill ride than minecraft that encourages griefing and killing other players, needless to say this will give you endless amounts of laughs and surpise you for many hours. If you managed to pick this up in a bundle, great! If not and you’re like for a pixelated fix, it’s worth every dollar!  "

All of the servers are all and all the same and for ten bucks I wish I knew about the refund system when I bought this about a year ago. I wouldn't spend ten bucks on this game simply because it just becomes more and more boring. The more you play the more it just feels like any other cheap building games like ROBLOX and at least ROBLOX was free and the people who made the games had variety. Most of these servers are just random people building random rubbish with the sort of complicated building system.			"

AUDIOSimpleVISUALLegoDIFFICULTYAverageVIBEGoofyCRAVINGGarry's ModON SALERarelyPROS: Lots of building options, tons of color, texture and block shape options to build just about anything you put your mind to. Mount, weapon, and interactive options galore. This is probably one of the best building games out there.CONS: Community appears to be entirely made up of very young children. There also appears to be no options for spawned features/copy-paste in worlds, meaning that you will have to download or make maps entirely by yourself, piece-by-piece. Controls are very complex.WORTH: It's worth full price if you're a building fanatic, but you may have trouble finding people to play with if you wish to enjoy the more multiplayer aspects. It doesn't go on sale as often as other games do, so you might have to wait a while for a discount.OVERALL: A lot of people say this game peaked about 5 years ago or so. I wouldn't know, because I wasn't there-- But it is clear that this game is full of potential that is not being utilized for one reason or another. It's disappointing that I will not be able to do much with my creations beyond screenshot them or show them to close friends who also own this.SCORE:5/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												The game overall is very funny and addictive at times, Blockland is basically a First-Person/Third-Person sandbox where you have the game world in your hands to build whatever comes out of your mind. With an environment editor, eventing system, a variety of bricks to choose from the game is pretty fun.With mods, everything changes, the game is absolutely much more better when you have mods installed to your game, these add-ons can include new bricks, vehicles, clients, scripts, events, and so on. There's also a new dedicated service called Blockland Glass, a mod hosting service and chat service that is basically a replacement from the abandoned Return To Blockland.The community is small, but you can find good people here, some are toxic, but that's what you'd expect from games. there's usually over a hundred people online every day, but at night around the US, it lowers. Numerous servers can be found though, and you have the ability to buy one from a community hosted service, or you are able to host your sever dedicated or non-dedicated.The last pro is that the game itself has it's own forum, called Blockland Forums, here you can find many threads and topics that mostly relate to Blockland, except the off-topic. Add-ons are mainly released there, and you can find many discussions, such as help with the game, making add-ons, or generally talking about anything else related to Blockland.The game is very fun in my opinion, and it sadly got it's last big update in 2013, when the game was released on Steam. Things have come and gone by then, but I'd assure that you'd have a good time playing the game when you have friends. My experience in Blockland so far gives me a rating of a 8/10.Blockland Forums can be found here - https://forum.blockland.us/Blockland Glass can be found here -https://blocklandglass.com/Blockland Glass Hosting Service can be found here - https://forum.blockland.us/index.php?PHPSESSID=8or55m13cuhi6ohrhos2ie0ej2&topic=303684.0 "

Building at first seems alittle weird but dont let that turn you off, you'll be getting the hand of it soon!

												I remember having given Blockland in Christmas of 2009 (And re-buying and still playing it via Steam at this point). And back in the day, it tended to be a clone of Roblox in terms of building blocks and other notible assets. Which THEN, a few months ago, made people point out ""AAAH THIS IS MINECRAFT BUT ALL SCRATCHY AND SHIZZ"" and was going like that ever since. Yup, I know how you Minecraft peoples are.So for this review, I'm not only going to review this game, but compare this to Minecraft a bit, and why I sometimes like to dub this ""Hipster Minecraft"".So basically what Blockland is, is a first-person sandbox multiplayer create-your-own-anything game. SOUND FAMILIAR??? You control inhabitants known as ""Blockheads"" and build anything, Yup, quite familiar. HOWEVER, you do NOT start in a pre-generated world. It is a flatgrass-style area you find yourself in. All saves you make are only builds, and not whole worlds, which is not as convoluted as Minecraft as all you can do to get a build you made is straight-up load it like a schematic.Now for building things and designing games, functions, etc.: You can see building is quite advanced and more difficult than Minecraft. But it's great if you want a first-person Sandbox building game with more detailed models than Minecraft, as Minecraft is all 1-meter blocks and very flat compared to Blockland blocks. For functions, you can use a Wrench to make blocks emit light and particles, as well as implement functions to make games and programming. Minecraft pretty much does the same thing with Command Blocks, etc., but IMO, Blockland is more simple than Minecraft in terms of functions. Because Minecraft's functioning requires specific functions and assets, sometimes extra mods, to make a good mechanism. I MIGHT be missing something here, as I have never tried such functions myself in Minecraft, but I should say that you have no information to design Minecraft functioning whatsoever unless you use the internet, which I don't really like doing given how the Minecraft community is nowadays.Blockland may be difficult and advanced to build than Minecraft, with all the little blocks to use and everything, but I found that it's much simpler to build what I want without getting my♥♥♥♥♥♥kicked in Minecraft trying to obtain a specific asset for my work. People would say Minecraft is waaaay better than Blockland that they hate this game, but I'm one of the few who played it back then and had a good time, speaking of which...Everybody knows Minecraft is the way to go besides Blockland. But for the nosalgia, or stuff Minecraft can't as mentioned above, I play this. I'm one of the few who actually like this game and I'm glad it doesn't have a fustercluck of a community like Minecraft, which is what I was anxious to point out. I really admire how quiet and underrated Blockland and its community is compared to Minecraft, and even Roblox as well. (I also played Roblox and it was pretty cheezy). Minecraft's majority of fans has pretty much bubble-bursted, where Blockland is ""Just right"", however getting beat down by Minecraft.But I will say this as I finish up this review. Blockland came years before Minecraft. It is not exactly a ripoff of Minecraft, which I apparently am seeing an award of which this game attained. I give this game a thumbs up, as it was what got me going before Minecraft was all the rage. This is just my opinion though. I'm only proving a point about Blockland vs Minecraft, and NO I do not think Blockland < Minecraft. It's all the Minecraft tweenies that are implying that this game is crapple. When I play Minecraft, I have that feeling that I shouldn't be playing this game anymore, whereas in Blockland, it's calm and I don't need to be reminded by the overdose Minecraft has become. (I still like Minecraft though)			"

It was a wonderful game (and still is), but the community has all but disappeared, heavily impacting the amount of fun one can have. If you enjoy building things with legos, and don't mind doing it in a ghost town, then by all means buy it, otherwise it's going to get lonely rather quickly.			"

												I'm not sure I'll be able to put my feelings for this game in words as eloquently as some of the other reviews here, but I'll do my best.I would like to start off by saying that I have, at the very least, 2000 hours logged into this game pre-steam. Blockland is the first game I ever bought, almost 6 years ago. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ Back then, it was still $20, and I can tell you now that I would have paid five times that amount back then if I knew how much I would have loved it.Other people have already explained the building system and the events system, so I won't really talk about those. What I would like to talk about, however, is the add-on creation system. Don't get me wrong, I truly enjoy building and eventing, but I wouldn't keep coming back to this game as often as I do if there weren't any add-ons. Not even just using add-ons though. More than that: creating them, changing them, collaborating on them. Even though some of the coding may be limited by the engine in this game, it more than makes up for this by flattening the learning curve for making your own mods. In my honest opinion, there are way more possibilities for creativity because of this. Because more people are making add-ons, there is a lot more diversity and plenty of originality when it comes to gamemodes, server mods, etc. The reason why I said ""at the very least, 2000 hours"", is because of all the time I've spent in text editors, writing code. That's actually the reason why you won't see many hours played on my steam account for Blockland, I'm in the midst of making a big gamemode (look for it, people of the future). This game is where I learned how to do basic logic constructions and other similar things for writing code. The language is called ""torquescript"", and it's pretty similar to C in most ways. It's incredibly easy to learn because of the syntax checker (to catch any mistakes you make), and because you can instantly see the result of your code ingame. Because of my previous experience with coding, I've been able to pick up visual basic and C almost instantly. For my job, I was able to program a z-axis camera mount using C# and also to make a protocol for an x-y motion system using a custom compiler for visual basic. I've included these in my resume, and next year when I leave for college there's no doubt in my mind that I will continue using code. In fact, it's very likely that my experience with code will have helped me get in the school of my choice (already accepted to one of my top choices).While I know this isn't necessarily something that everyone will experience if they play the game, I know I just wanted to share my story. Know that even if you have no interest in modding, Blockland has something for you. I've never seen, heard, or smelled of a game that could truly have ""endless possibilities"". That is, except for Blockland.			"

												I had the demo for this for a few years, and when I got the full version I was just so happy. So ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ happy. Then the steam release came, and I am OK with it, but new players, there used to be something called the ""Steam Apocalypse"", where many a blockhead will join random servers and screw up everything. Fear not, that's over, but my 3+ years of having this game and nearly mastering it, I can't say it's bad. Some say the physics is bad. And if you do... can you find the nearest gun and ammunition? THE PHYSICS IS THE BEST ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ THING EVER. It's what makes the Speedkart gamemode Speedkart. It's so hilarious nearly every time! The last thing I have to say: When trying to up your fighting skills, make sure you don't fight any experienced tryhards. Don't. Ever. Unless you're also an experienced tryhard, in which case, ♥♥♥♥ you! Go ahead and fight! I did get the steam version for free, because my Blockland key is older than the steam release. I don't play the steam version because my non-steam version has all my add-ons (basically mods except you don't need to download them to use them, except for textures, sounds, and music).			"

												Amazing game! I love to play multiplayer because there are so many things to do. You never need any friends to play because there's a bunch of strangers to play with and who doesn't like strangers?! You should definitely get this great game. Also, if you do get this game, play Crown's Jailbreak and Tezuni's Prison Escape they're extremely fun and pretty much the only reason I still play blockland. I guarantee that if you are a modder you will love this game. If not, it's still really fun just to see what other people made and play on other people's servers. If you do not get this game I will tell you to get it over and over until you do. This is by far the best game I have ever played. I rate Blockland 9.5/10. I hope this review was helpful, go get Blockland! Now! I mean it! RIGHT NOW! :D			"

												Almost over a year ago I already made a review on this old piece.Sure, blockland is losing players, but you have to admit that it has stood the test of time. It's funny even today people keep calling it a roblox and minecraft rip off.Let me put you at ease:Blockland's Release Date: February 24, 2007Minecraft's Release Date: October 7, 2011Notice the issue here? How can blockland rip off minecraft if it didn't exist for 4 more years?Roblox's Release Year: 2006Blockland is 1 year younger than Roblox, but this does not make it a rip off. Since 2006 & 2007 the game's have taken turns, mostly roblox has, and blockland has not been trying to rip off roblox. If it has why do the games look nothing alike?Anyways, I still will recommend this old sandbox for years to come and hope it will survive the test of time as long as it can.			"

												This game is mind-blowingly awesome. You want to abuse rapid firing rockets via an event system or just want to build a humble little home? Well, here's your solution.I reccomend the first thing you'd want to do is go to Start A Game and click on the Tutorial gamemode. Then start this game and make it singleplayer and follow the steps shown on screen.The game uses an easy to install add-on system, which is basically finding the Steam directory on your computer (Windows: Steam > SteamApps > Common > Blockland) and dragging and dropping your selected file into the AddOns Folder. I think this system will eventually be modded and changed to work with Steam Workshop like Garry's Mod. Once you have the right addons and knowledge of how to use them, the possibilities for a good server are endless.The building mechanics are very simple once you get the hang of them - simply using the numpad/your selected control scheme to maneuver the blocks into the right place and pressing Enter  when your ''Ghost Brick (Invisible brick you will see when you click the ground to move a block around) is above a support or another block. Then you can use the Paint Can (default key is E) to paint this block a selected colour.Physics-wise, this game is absolutely mad. If you think it's hilarious to have your car flung into oblivion then this game is definitely the one you want. This also kind of falls into the category of graphics. This game's visuals are not the best, but definitely better than Minecraft's. (Sorry Notch.)The game uses an eventing system which is a basic scripting mechanism. I think there should be a guide somewhere on the magic that is the Steam page, and that also tells you the rest about the game. Also, little LEGO guys.They're so cute.10/10 would build giant castle again.			"

												This is my favorite PC game of all time! If you like to build things, this is one of the best games you can get to do so. There are tons of things you can do in this game, like creating DMs, RPGs, racing builds, and sports arenas. You name it and you can probably build it! You can easily make the things you want to build with good building controls and a nice, clean user interface. Plus there is even a very useful event system that you can use, so you can turn a light switch on or off, create bots to interact with your build, and much, much more! People have also created a vast amount of mods that Blockland calls ""add-ons"", using the game's built-in mod support. The only real flaw of the game, would be some of the community if you ever decide to play the game online, but if you stick around the servers that have nice people on it, you can have a really good time making new friends and just having a blast fooling around! There are tons of other features that I haven't even mentioned and some vital add-ons that make this game a lot better like the Duplicator and the Fill Can. All in all, if you like to build with legos and like a game where you can do anything you want at any time, just click that buy button! If you are a bit skeptical about the game and you need to experience it firsthand before buying, there is a demo available on the official website (http://www.blockland.us). If you ever do get Blockland, you are free to add me on Steam as a friend so I can help ya out! :D			"

												Blockland describes itself as 'that game where you build stuff'. That's actually pretty accurate!ContentBlockland runs on an older version of the Torque Game Engine. It revolves around what are essentially legos, as the title implies. You control a small plastic figure called a 'blockhead', and the core element of the game involves placing bricks (with very intuitive controls) and then changing them with paint, emitters, or a simple programming system to create pretty much anything. There's support for add-ons and a weapon system, which opens possibilities for team deathmatches and any number of other gamemodes.PositiveThe controls. Blockland's movement and view controls are similar to any other 3D game - WASD to move, mouse to look, space to jump, so on, so forth. The build controls are almost as easy to use. Pressing a numpad key moves the brick in that direction, just like WASD; the corner keys move up and down or rotate the brick, and numpad 0 clears your 'ghost' brick (which shows where you're going to place it). This does take a day or two to learn well, but once you figure it out it's hard to think of a better way.Blockland also has decent multiplayer features, and involves a player-hosted server system. One of the core elements of the game is the fact that you're not just building stuff - you're all building stuff together. Servers can, by default, support up to 32 players; a workaround has been used to increase this to 99. The fact that servers are player-hosted removes most problems with lag; each individual server has to have a poor connection to be affected, instead of just one master server (there is, in fact, a master server, but it only keeps a list of all the servers players are hosting; IP connections can still be used).Bricks can be 'evented', or programmed, to do a number of things. The events system acts on a per-brick basis and is actually very easy to understand. You choose an input from a drop-down box - like onActivate (when the brick is clicked) or onPlayerTouch (more self-explanatory), then a target (Player, Client, Brick, Named Brick, etc.), then an action (setColor, Kill, playSound). For example - onActivate -> Player -> addVelocity(0, 0, 10) would make a ladder rung, when clicked, give the player a boost up. More than one event can be placed on a brick, and they can be delayed or even chained together with something called a relay.Finally, Blockland has an extensive add-on system that can be used to change almost any part of the game. New bricks can be added, or emitters, or colors, or events, or any other number of things. Even the GUI is open for change; the only rules are those that the programming language sets. The programming language is, however, slightly limited by the game's creator; this is mostly to avoid hacking or cheating, which are nigh-impossible without illegally modifying the game.NegativeFirst - the game carries the potential for what I call minecraft syndrome. You buy the game and just LOVE it; then you play it for several weeks or months and abruptly lose all interest. I first encountered this effect while playing Minecraft, hence the name; I used to play both games constantly, and now I haven't touched either of them for months for no apparent reason.Secondly, the game's community can be picky. Just mentioning Minecraft as above might get me some insults and complaints; half of Blockland's community is notorious for their hate of the games Minecraft and Roblox, the sole reason appearing to be that they're similar to Blockland (or vice verse). Also, the game has a website with a forum; there's a good share of good people as well as an impressive number of idiots that can be found there. The community isn't horrible, but it isn't the greatest I've seen, either.Finally, the game lost some of its former value with the v21 update. This update removed terrains and interiors - excellent parts of the game that allowed landscapes and buildings to be used as the scene for construction - in favor of shaders (like you might find in any other game) and bots (what it says on the tin). The game wasn't ruined, but it was definitely made worse. Terrains and interiors may return, and I hope they do, but having to build on an infinite flat plane shouldn't hinder your creativity!SummaryBlockland's features outweigh its flaws - while the community could be nicer and some recent updates are questionable, the game has a solid base and a good number of features to support it. Its support for add-ons and mods make almost anything possible, and there's already a great number of these out there. If you enjoyed building with legos as a kid, consider yourself a decent artist, need practice with programming, or just want a good way to have fun with your friends - this game is for you.			"

-Quick Review-This game is basically Garry’s Mod but with Lego’s. I’ve never played Garry’s Mod, but the concept is basically the same. I had minecraft expectations, but I purchased the game on sale so I can’t really complain one way or another. -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  NAGame Play: The game has controls very similar to Garry’s Mod. I don’t know if you adjust things you’re placing with the Number Keys on Garry’s Mod, but I assume that they’re very closely related. Achievements: Nothing to write home about, regarding the achievements. Personally “hidden” and “no description text” achievements really are annoying for me because you can simply look them up online. So there’s no real point in hiding the goal from us.Price: The price for Blockland is  $9.99 That’s way to high of a price for how much entertainment I’ll get out of it. This isn’t one of those games you can jump right in and start playing with. There is a learning curve to understand how the tools work and what you’re doing.If you’re into games like that you’ll enjoy this game, but there are other RPG’s that I would like to play instead of learning how to play Blockland at this current date. Conclusion: I’m on the fence regarding this game. Most people probably won’t put much time into the game.

												It's a game not like garry's mod, not like a map editor for those valve games, it really is a hands-on experience where you and some friends can make something in real time, not handing a map file over and over and playing tennis with a map.It's a game where you don't grab pre-made things from garry's mod and actually create your own structures / and vice versa. It really is like playing with legos on the internet, but with the modding scene for this game, the game feels less like a game for 5-year olds and more for new scripters to get into coding, as it's extremely easy to make a bricks/gun/vehicle/light/effect and put it straight onto your server for people to see.The community right now is filled with a bunch of angsty teenagers who like to ddos for no apparent reason, but it really is rare to have your server ddos'd unless you anger the community that much.

												Theres so much you can build in this game, and the modds are endless. From a wide range of Projectile and melee weapons, to a wide range of fighting and civilian vehicles, bricks, terrain parts, i just cant stress enough the amount of things you can do in this game. I mean this when i say it, you can name one thing in the world, it will most likely be in the Mod forums. When i was told that i could name anything, i said ""Weapons made after real life counter parts with working velocity and gravitational pull with bullets, along with aiming features and a reload system"" i found about 4 Packs of 20+ guns with this kind of system. So with all that being said, screw minecraft Blockland is a step in the right direction.			"

-Quick Review-This game is basically Garry’s Mod but with Lego’s. I’ve never played Garry’s Mod, but the concept is basically the same. I had minecraft expectations, but I purchased the game on sale so I can’t really complain one way or another. -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  NAGame Play: The game has controls very similar to Garry’s Mod. I don’t know if you adjust things you’re placing with the Number Keys on Garry’s Mod, but I assume that they’re very closely related. Achievements: Nothing to write home about, regarding the achievements. Personally “hidden” and “no description text” achievements really are annoying for me because you can simply look them up online. So there’s no real point in hiding the goal from us.Price: The price for Blockland is  $9.99 That’s way to high of a price for how much entertainment I’ll get out of it. This isn’t one of those games you can jump right in and start playing with. There is a learning curve to understand how the tools work and what you’re doing.If you’re into games like that you’ll enjoy this game, but there are other RPG’s that I would like to play instead of learning how to play Blockland at this current date. Conclusion: I’m on the fence regarding this game. Most people probably won’t put much time into the game. I intend to sometime come back to the game and see what kind of stuff I can build, but like I said, it requires a learning curve… and I suspect a work flow as well.Do not expect this game to control like minecraft, it controls like Gary’s Mod, or a “First person 3D program”.

												PROS: - Gameplay is fun and simple - Numbpad brick placement is fantastic and easy to use - Multiplayer custom gamemodes and add-ons are endless - Character customization is easy and can make for some pretty hilarious character costumesCONS: - Graphics are not optimized for♥♥♥♥♥♥br> - Multiplayer Community is mostly dominated by cocky players (Hence, I said mostly) - Single-player can be boring. Otherwise there is no actual feedback from the game to the player.OVERVIEW:     I have played games like Roblox, Minecraft and Ace of Spades, and find joy in those games because of the community's creative standpoint, and Blockland is no exception. This game is the easiest one to pick up because it ACTUALLY HAS A TUTORIAL! (Which is still dumb because you have to load it up, there is no ""Tutorial"" button anywhere so you're left to find it yourself.) The controls are easy AND difficult. If you're used to FPS controls of switching through your weapons using 1, 2,  etc. Then prepare to be tricked as your bricks are assigned to your number keys while your weapons are located in your tools inventory by pressing Q (Or binded key). The numbpad can be used to move your bricks along a grid before placing them, which helps A LOT. Not a lot of sandbox, blocky games have this kind of feature and just makes Blockland much easier to play and enjoy. As for bricks, THIS GAME HAS A TON and more can even be added as add-ons, which by the way, is simple and easy to understand so you can install a plethora of mods made by the community. The Multiplayer in this game is really fun and most likely the only way you will play. The community is thriving through servers so meeting people in one place and finding them in another is pretty common and honestly feels nice because it feels like you are really getting to know the community and its players. As for Multiplayer gameplay, expect the normal Call of Duty like feedback from players. The occasional ""OMG stop playing like that!"" does turn up and its just as annoying. But if you're a troll and like screwing with players, then it should be no different than from how you troll on any other game. For the cons listed, I feel really upset that these are actually issues, because most of it can be easily simplified and fixed, fun-wise. The graphics are really up there in terms of quality. High graphics means your computer is somehow a beast because most high-end graphic cards can't run this game to its full potential. As for Singleplayer gameplay. Its just a simple complaint. This may be more of a personal standpoint so understand that this is mainly just a suggestion if anything. Singleplayer is NOT fun. It doesn't matter if you nuke entire maps of zombie NPCs. You will get bored of playing alone EASILY, and it is only because there isn't any actual user-friendly feedback coming from the game. I understand it's a singleplayer mode in a sandbox game, but even Gmod has a way of communicating with the player to make them seem like they are a part of the games world, immersing them into the game and grabbing their attention to want to continue playing.     This game is not bad, but your own fun has to be found in it, especially in the Multiplayer which can still give you a great taste of the game's actual feel. I do recommend this game, but it does feel like it can easily be put down.			"

												A great game which not only lets you build, but blow some stuff up with explosives.And yet, the addons assist us on making the game more fun.We know some rare addons are not listed.But heres a question if you respond.Would you rather...Yes : Install every addons you think will improve your serverNo : Be a total random collector and install random addons you will think improves the server's attention (but pretend you think it would if you do this).You can either rate or comment.---[Break #1]---Regardless.A backstory.""Imminum hosted a Renderman server not just a hunt, but a Survival which people find their own spot and survive there.Imminum's server got atleast 6/10 peoples attention worldwide.It was taking year in 2014 then.But then a twist occured.The attention got lower and lower, bringing less people.This got less entertaining.Until the year of 2015, it was gone.People searched for related servers to be entertaining.Imminum's server now ran into issues. He must fix them inorder to get the server back up.This now leads to a big problem to fix."" - Audio Log 24/06/2014 #3739172If you think you want to support this server.Do what you need to.---[Break #2]---This game inspires builders to create builds such as cities, towns, replicates, everything.But there are some battles over 2 games that have been a problem, causing people to quit blockland forever, and that is Undertale, and FNaF.Me? I'm not really much but I look forward for reactions, and when I heard people countering our attacks, I mentioned this.""The reason why we are doing this is because we do not want our community to die down because of all of this. I only like the game on itself but, this? I'm not really a fan of FNaF but we needed this because we do not want people to be forced to leave Blockland. As not to be offensive, I keep things seperate and try not to be really crashing servers. But, i'm sorry to those of you who like to have these servers on this game. We needed to do this because our community has been decreased.We do not promote any cyber-bullying for this. This is to keep both community outof each other. We are sorry for those of you who wanted to host just FNaF servers. We had to.I'm also finding some complaints over Undertale somehow, me?Well - I'm staying low for that."" - ImminumWhen I mentioned this, I looked forward for some regrets and agreements as our goal to bring back the Blockland community alive and live on!

												I've been playing this game since 2009, and I am so glad it made it to steam.In short, this game is Garry's Mod, but made out of bricks. Let your creativity run wild to construct cities, spaceships, and so much more. Have fun in in various minigames ranging from TDMs to City RPs. Events let you change the behavior of bricks, from changing colours when clicked to managing an item shop. This game's only limitation is truly its players' imagination. What is missing from the stock game can be found on the forums in the form of Add-Ons, which expand the game's content, by adding bricks, vehicles, weapons, gamemodes and a myriad of other miscellaneous improvements or changes.I'd recommend it to players who appreciate the sandbox genre and any lego fan.

It's  Garry's Mod[www.garrysmod.com] with Legos.. I hated that Badspot (Eric Hartman) removed maps. It was my favorite thing to do.

Unfortunately, this means that most laptops do not have the numpad, thus making it unable to build (who even PLAYS on laptops, anyway?)Online not working:1. Options > Networking2.

												Okay, I've been playing the game since around 2007, while having varying interest in the game up until the present day. From version 9 and up, it was a great game, nearly everyone♥♥♥♥♥♥their pants when they heard about a new update because it brought new content to the table. Now it's rarely updated with versions that would constitute themselves more as a hotfix rather than anything else. We've arrived at the end of blockland's development and Badspot has practically lost all interest in the game. Is this a bad thing? For me, not really, seeing as there are always modders and mapmakers ready to enhance the game's experience. Let me tell you, there are many mods out there to suit your tastes, so I hope you'll never be bored with the different possibilities. As far as creativity goes, you can go all out and push the limits of the game if you have to. It's basic lego building but with the ability to not go out to your local toys r us and dropping 30+ on a set of legos. You can also play mini-games and other stuff in these worlds that you build.So to make things brief, the game is great. Go ahead and pick it up, it's only ~$10, try it out. If you don't like it, you didn't waste much.			"

That's over 840 hours. Pros:Good graphics (if your computer can handle them)Tons and tons of add-onsReally good building system once you learn itYou can do just about anything with enough timeLegos+Garry's Mod=BlocklandCons:It can take a while to get used to building with itSmall community. This is why YOU should buy this game. We need more players!A lot of people talk about how bad the community is. In some ways it is bad. BUT, there are still a lot of nice people who are willing to help the new players learn the ropes. I personally enjoy it when I get to teach new players how to do things, it's just an awesome experience where I get to help people, which is something I love. Yes, the community is  mixed bunch, there are little kids, there are idiots, there a simply mean people. But, there's also nice people.  "

Don't let the amount of play time fool you; I put thousands of hours into this game.  Well worth it!Highly-recommended in my book!			"

												If you are looking for a nice fun game, Not too much minecraft and not too much gmod or roblox (Ew this game sucks) well here you go. If you DO like legos and Garry's Mod and that kind of sandbox stuff well this is just it, better yet with different gamemodes too and custom gamemodes also. Hosting a multiplayer server is also not that hard actually it is really easy, just use 1 button of 3 choices and the server is hosted and up. Great Game. Have fun!			"

												REDGrim here and all I have to say is ""Hell yes!"" Well, actually maybe a little bit more than that...I love Blockland! I started playing back when it was in it's earliest stages around 2004 (Know as ""Vanilla Blockland"") You can build blocks with all of your friends online and do/make anything you want. The system for building is very comprehensive and efficient once you learn the controls. There's fun stuff like weapons and vehicles for all your death match needs. You can also code the blocks to do different things, like trigger stuff, move, emit particles or lights etc. Lots of options, little to no limitations. It's really amazing! Definitely a game worth your money! 10/10 I highly recommend.			"

												The game is still good and mods are very easy to install and lots of fun. Redguys unlimited mining is a good time sink. But MAPS HAVE BEEN REMOVED.. There is literally no such things as maps any more it's just slate. Also the steam version didn't work for me, so I used my key on the normal version. Word is the dev has stopped caring and he censors the forums.. So buy it but only if it's on sale lole.Also i have played hundreds of hours just not on steam version. Had so much fun skiing down the mountain map but THERE ARE NO MORE ♥♥♥♥ING MAPS			"

												This game is best described as Garry's Mod with legos. In Blockland you can do anything at all: play or make a team deathmatch, medieval rpg, zombie game, murder mystery, sports games, dogfight, portal, arcade games, prison escape, challenge, deathrun, racing games, farming rpg, city rpg, and infinitely more. I've been playing this game for years and it never gets old- something new is always coming out, and building + eventing is an extremely rewarding experience. This game is an awesome sandbox for people to build upon and come up with new game modes. Games should focus first on a fun gameplay experience, and Blockland manages this extremely well. By far my favorite game.Buy this now, you'll love it no matter your age :)			"

												Yes, Yes, And more, Yes.Blockland is one of the best games ive ever played. (Hence the 2400 hours i have)It may seem hard when you start but after say, 50 hours you get used to it.With the 2.4k hours i have im pretty good at both building and eventing.When you start you see all of these epic builds, But as you progress and get better, They become less epic until you can build and event way better. When i started i was like, Holy! Those are some good builds, Now im just like, I could do better.You can choose to try and be good at eventing or building, I chose eventing, Its why im not so good a builder, You can choose both but it results in being less good at both, I would reccomend this game to most people with a creative mind.Good luck if you get this!

												When I first discovered this game, I saw it as as simplified version of Minecraft with Legos. However, upon watching videos, reading articles, browsing the forum, and ultimately purchasing and playing the game, I discovered there was much more than meets the eye. The simple, yet intuitive tutorial introduces you to the basics of the game without overloading you with information and walls of text. It gives you the freedom to learn many of the amazing things available in the world of Blockland by yourself, furthering the satisfaction value of this game. There are so many things to discover in the 50 or so megabytes of initial download, and endless possibilities to further expand gameplay with scores of user-created addons and mods. This is without a doubt, the most versatile game you will find on the market.			"

There's also a special scripting system for the more advanced players.  You'll get used to it.  Regardless, this is the best building game around that gives you so much freedom with mods and add-ons, unlike Minecraft which will commonly have errors.

There are always plenty of new servers full of awesome games, challenges, and even role plays.  The developers put in a lot of works into the updates, making sure they are highest of quality.  Updates may take a while, however, they are extremely well done and worth it.  This game has always had a special place in my heart and will most likely always be my favorite.  I highly suggest buying Blockland, as it is worth it's old price of $20 just as much as it's new price is.			"

Think of it like legos (somewhat similar to Minecraft and Roblox, but VERY different, do not ever compare these games together), you can build stuff with it with your own creative mind, like parks, buildings, wonders, and etc..This game has many types that you can add into this game, there is a add-on feature that is made in this game. So you may check it out if you like.In addition, I've hosted CityRPG, and CRP on my server in the past, And I will be hosting CRP again in Spring 2014, so keep an look out for that with me and my fellow administrators, Jasa, Knox, and Mistshadow, and the fellow staff team.

												Note: to see this review in it's true form (formating and screenshots) go to:http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/05/game-blockland.htmlBlockland is that game where you build ""stuff"". offten accused of being a copy of Roblox or Minecraft, Blockland is in fact it's own genre. its more of a Garrys Mod with blocks than a Minecraft clone. in fact Blockland came out in 2007 compared to Mincrafts 2010 release.Anyways like i said in Blockland you can build whatever you can image and build with blocks. i am not very good myself at building and creating but even then Blockland is fun. you can play gamemodes like Deathmatch using any weapon you want. even better Blockland has an ""event"" system that allows players to make extreme almost script like content.The best part of Blockland has to be the thousands of mods you can get for it on Return to Blockland, a mod within itself that lets you easily download addons for Blockland all most like Steam Workshop. what kind of addons? well all most anything, there are addons that add new bricks, addons that give you more weapons, addons that give you new things to drive, addons that give you different colors to use in builds, and addons that add gamemodes. some modders have added zombies and left for dead like gamemodes. there are racing game modes and plan old sandbox gamemodes.Blockland is uber fun with people online or even a LAN game. the problem is that Blockland seems to have network issues. regularly kicking you from games or even just not letting you join them. and as with Garry's mod if you join a server with addons that you don't have, getting them from the server will be a pain. i also wish Blockland had a voice talk ability in Multiplayer but that can be solved by using TeamSpeak or some such service.Blockland suffers from an outdated game engine know as Torque 3D. while the newest version of Torque itself is not bad Blockland uses the older version.the game did just get Shader support it came at the cost of Blockland maps. Maps had terrain and objects that where not made out of blocks. but because the Shader system could not support the maps they where removed. meaning the only way you can get terrain is if you build it out of blocks. not a problem for people good with the blocks and those with a good computer. because having that many blocks hits the Frame Rate pretty bad.In the end Blockland is a fun sandbox game that lets you do a lot of epic stuff. as long as your comptuer can handle it. it is in NO WAY a clone of Mincraft, Roblox, or any other block like game. if you enjoy games like Garry's Mod then Blockland will be perfect for you.

This game is the original Danish toy product that took Britain by storm (Lego).I've played for between 6-7 hours on it so far since I bought it. And it's the best fun I've had. I got it in a bundle of other games and so far it's been the one I've played the most and has distracted me from World Of Warcraft (Only slightly). If you like Lego and Building Blocks and enjoyed the original Roblox and other fun gametypes. You'll want to get this game ASAP. You won't regret it. I guarantee you			"

												I grew up playing the original alpha of this game, it was called Blockland v00002, lagged like a mofo and it was barely playable on my Pentium 4 PC. But, most importantly, it was fun.Then a bunch of years later, this game came out - and it is just absolutely amazing. Think of it as a sort of lego-builder's Garry's Mod. Sure, you've got your great building tools to make awesome♥♥♥♥♥♥with your friends in the default sandbox mode, within the limitations (it's still lego, so you can't have any floating bricks, for example), but apart from that, anyone can create new weapons, vehicles, and entirely new gamemodes with the game's scripting language (the uh, not terribly excellent TorqueScript).And the builds you make can be enhanced with event bricks, which are basically interactive bricks that'll react to say, a player walking on it, in ways that you define in the game with a simple system. Some dude made a playable pong using that, which is batshit crazy. And awesome.All in all, I can't find a good way to end this, because I'm not a writer, but I really, truly love this game, and I wish more people would play it with me.Game of the year, every year, 10/10.

												A HORRENDOUS FAILURE OF A GAME!!Okay, where do I begin?I guess I should say it's not the game that's cancer, its the community. Look on the game's official forum for proof. There is literally an ENITRE THREAD DEDICATED TOWARDS FLAMING OTHER USERS!!!Not only that, but you have many, many people (Kids and adults) that do NOT act thier age whatsoever. And with a large portion of the community having mental illnesses such as Autism, it can be very annoying at most times. (Im not saying people with a legitimate mental illness are bad, but they can be annoying without even knowing it)Now, there is some good with this game. The user-created content back from around 2010 still remains extremely popular today, and builds, bricks, weapons, and tools still remain extremely fun to mess around with today, in the game's single player. There are even brick add-ons that add even more actual LEGO blocks to the game!However, in conclusion, your $10 dollars would be MUCH better spent on a different game, perhaps one of the older GTA games? Or maybe a few case keys in CSGO?Or, best of all, you could take the $10 you were going to use on virtual Legos and go out to any old toy store and buy yourself some REAL Legos!It'd pry be more fun than this game anyways...

I recommend avoiding this. N//AI'll be honest, I can't give a detailed review because I haven't had a lot of experience with this game, and please take this into account, this is my experience as a newcomer to this game. I personally don't like recommending against games, but I recommend that people avoid buying this. I don't think this is a game worth buying, and starting now because the servers are almost dead. When I say almost, I mean I haven't seen it rise over 200 in the time I've owned it. It currently has 161 members across every server. Only 8 servers with more than 10 people in them (Their number ranges from 10-20), the rest consist of small numbers of people. And ignoring the overall player count, I haven't had a fun experience with the game. Not because it is a bad game, but it is an oudated one, and it isn't getting updated anymore. So you are left with a small community in a game that now has little to offer. The only popular servers right now are Role Playing servers, where you pretend to live alongside other players, and a few battle servers, but I don't enjoy these because of the ingame combat. There are also a few building servers with a few players in, but with the players ingame, I'd recommend getting a better where you are able to design and build.In this game, you start up, or join an already started multiplayer server. No disrepect to people who still enjoy to play the game with a friend, but I haven't had a great multiplayer experience in the larger servers. The players are active in chat, but I can never get into chat because it's just complaining, and arguing, and asking for a boyfriend etc. I'm not sure the age range of people still playing the game, but this has been my experience.

												The game is great when you have enough people playing local, but most of the regular multiplayer is too laggy to be fair. But don't get me wrong, this game is still tons of fun! Similar to Garry's mod, it is easlily added on to, there are goals only set by the players, and there are TONS of halarious moments.First, I want to start with the gameplay.It is about as rock solid as the game will ever get. Blockland appeals to a broad audience through it's open ended ways of playing. For instance, you can build if you are into creativity. Lets say that you don't care for building, that is not a problem. You could join a multiplayer kart race, deathmatch or some other original gamemode that Blockland could boast. The only thing bogging this part down is the slow multiplayer connections and the TERRIBLE physics. And by TERRIBLE, I mean if you hit somebody with a car just right, or should I say wrong, you could in fact get a one way ticket to the statosphere. (Then again, it's not exactly bad when it happens to your friend, in fact that's halarious). If you have a good internet connection, then this game's multiplayer will appeal to you.Well, I don't really have another category to cover so...Pros-* Been around for 7 years, still active updates (sorta).* Easy to mod* Fun Multiplayer* Creative Structure* Solid, refined gameplay concepts* I have had no problems with the community so far* Good graphics for a block game.* Makes halarious moments with or without friends aroundCons-* The physics can be beyond bad.* Bad multiplayer connections.* Did I mention the physics?* Setting up a multiplayer server is brutally hard. (not really their fault)(EDIT: I found a few more)*The public multiplayer has the worst community you will ever witness.*Lack of ambition (The game feels like it's becoming more and more abandoned each day)In my opinion, this game is solid enough to achieve a 8.9/10Im sure people will like it, but DEFINETLY NOT everyone.But for only ten dollars, it's one of the greatest user created content games that predates minecraft.

												Blockland has been around for a long time, and has sadly been burried. People still play, but it lost so much popularity. It's a fun sandbox building game where you can build and program anything. The way you build stuff is very similar to real-life LEGOs, where you are not allowed to have floating bricks. The law of gravity is impossible to break. You can still make bricks float by making invisible and walk through towers under a brick. You can press the left mouse button to activate your jets so you can fly around. There's a spray can that allows you to not only paint bricks, but give them special effects such as rainbows and also make bricks transparent. You start with three tools; a hammer, a wrench, and a printing gun. The hammer lets you break bricks you put, but you can't break bricks under another brick unless the brick you want to destroy won't cause the other bricks above to float in the air. You can type /wand to get a wand that acts just like a hammer, but if you destroy a brick that would cause any bricks above it to float, everything above it breaks also. The wrench lets you do many different things with your bricks. While holding the wrench, you can click on a brick to view its properties. You can make your brick emit fire, or smoke, or any other particle that's in the game. You can spawn more tools, like a sword or a gun, or something that'll help you build better things. You can also program your bricks with events. Events are super easy to learn. I made a basic Windows XP computer with very little knowledge of events when I was a noob, and the results were satisfactory! The properties will be different depending on the brick you select. For example, if I use the wrench on a vehicle spawner, I won't have the ability to make it into a spear giver. I can only select from a list of rideable objects. If I use the wrench on a music brick, I will be able to choose from a list of music for it to play. The printer gun lets you put pictures on printer bricks. It's useful for making signs for things like stores, or for cooler security systems. Building in Blockland is lots of fun! You can also download add-ons that other users made from other websites so you can get more content such as more guns and swords to blow up everyone, or tools to help you build better things. I hope Steam workshop comes out for this game soon so it'll be quicker to download and find add-ons. Blockland also has a minigame feature which lets you disable and enable certain fuctions such as building or jets and allow players to get points for doing certain tasks. With add-ons, you can enhance your minigames and make them even more fun to play with your friends. You could make a futuristic team deathmatch minigame, or a survival horror game using the popular Renderman add-on based on the legendary Renderman! This game has endless possibilities, and I am really sad to see it die like this. I mean it. I am literally sad. After the extremely popular Return to Blockland add-on was gone, many people started to give up on this game. Return to Blockland made Blockland more social by adding private chat (much like Steam's chat), friends, and the ability to join your friend in a server they are playing. It didn't just make Blockland a better game to play it friends. It gave you better admin tools. It allowed you to download add-ons very similar to how Steam workshop works. Many add-ons lost some functions because they depended on RTB. The Renderman add-on was one of them. You can't control when he spawns anymore. I will always remember how much fun Blockland was. R.I.P. one of my favorite sandbox games ever.			"

												If your like me. You enjoyed lego's when you were a kid but didn't have the new ones. Imagine a game where you build with lego's. And with weapons and mods and game modes and vehicles and much more. Blockland is a very fun sandbox and customiziable game with tons of options and a nice community. It's totally worth the $10.00 you have to pay for it. "

												Blockland is an epic game. Basically you can build anything you want, without anyone having to tell you what to do. You can play alone or play with friends. This game is like roblox except better. The animations and effects are good and you don't lag so much in game. In Blockland, you don't need any type of game money used to buy things for your avatar or something. I recommend Blockland, it's good game for anybody.			"

												This game has pushed it's limits.The Whole blockland universe is came to it's limit, i used to Love this game but i am questioning myself about this game, First off the vehicle physics is funny as hell, but it messes things up,the vehicle physics is out of control when it comes to doing a roleplay perfectly, or filming a movie for blockland, and most Active is SpeedKart, I love this game but it's not good anymore,Because of how hard people work and i work just to play this and build in it, Alot of people are rude and they grief you, Specially badadmins, This game has became the 50th game likebecause it's not in much use anymoreThis game is good and all but... one problemThis game has server problems, vehicle physics, And the brick limitThe brick limit is annoying because, Imagine your building a huge city, you hit the brick limit then you have to probably wipe it.I Cannot deal with all this stuffSo as blockland players,Badspot if your reading this, you need to add a workshop where people won't have to download it on the forums and the Shut down RTB, the forums contains viruses in some addons and plus this game needs to be updated alot, because all this bull that happens and just Awful.This game litterally needs to be updated alot, and a workshop.Do you agree with me?Should badspot add more updates with more bricks and features and a workshop?

I personally would rather have this community compaired to Minecraft or Roblox, or maybe even Gmod.

You could get anything from cars to doors, to gamemodes (including Super Murder Mystery, which is my all time favorite. This gamemode includes a few players who are in the mafia, who have to kill everyone else.)•Small community, meaning a better chance of running in to the same person multiple times, helping you make friends.TL;DR, Awesome game, little kids just keep your swear filter on.

The multiplayer however, offers A LOT with tons of RP, carting, building, and war servers. there are also a few other fun game modes but are not use so much on multiplayer such as ""blockheads destroy christmas"".The downside is that the graphics are WAY out of date, and the vehicle mechanis are also pretty bad. there are also quite a few  dead servers, but other than that, this game is extremely fun.PS this is not like minecraft, but more like if they made legos into a game.

Yes, I did have a couple of problems with the fact that there was a ""Block Limit"" everytime I launched my own Internet Freebuild server. It bugged me a lot. But then somehow it got fixed, and I have no idea how but it just did. I love playing on the servers as well. In the future, I will be starting a YouTube channel and this game will become one of my series with 2 other of my friends. It will be so much more fun!1 Request: Can you make the game a little more ""Organized"" in a way?Like, The Blockland forums arent really helpful, so get the Steam Workshop up and running!That would be so much easiser.Otherwise, I rate this 5 out of 5 stars! :D-DerpyBanana-SwagaDerp			"

												[ Introduction ]:Blockland is a mix between Roblox (non-steam) and a bit of Garry's Mod, therefore looking and playing like a ""Roblox done right"".The idea of the game is great: allowing players to build things with LEGO blocks and host their own servers with different game types. For further customization and setting of servers, Blockland also presents a simple enough Eventing System (simplified scripting) allowing the user to affect the entities, game client or the game running in the server.[ Positive Points ]:- Freedom of creation: For those who like to create and host servers, there is a great deal of freedom in the game, allowing anyone to create and host an unique server.- Easy to learn and get started.- DIfferent gametypes, that varies from Freebuild to Kart Races (with or without guns), Team Deathmatchs, CityRPGs, Empire (Civilization-like mini-games) and more.[ Negative Points ]:- As expected, the worst part of the game is it's community, probably composed by many children (or brain-damaged young adults and adults). Some very annoying and immature/offensive/pornographic stuff is said on the chat in any server. Even some servers Admins/Moderators are stupid and may get into the way of the players (derping in the middle of a firefight, standing in the middle of a road during a race, etc). - Also as expected due to the large amount of stupid members, many people don't know how to read, don't bother or are simply trolls, and dedicate themselves in annoying others. Stupid players also ruin RP games, like ""Super Murder Mystery"" (Blocklands' Trouble in Terrorist Town counterpart), turning most RP games into TDMs with lots of RDMing. Many mods and admins do their best to keep their servers clean, but any player will see this happening many times.- Buggy and laggy collision physics on vehicles, make some game modes very annoying or take much fun away.- Build mode can be very boring to work with when using a laptop without a numpad.- Little number of players and servers (from my experience).[ Conclusion ]:If you can get past the annoying community, there's fun to be had in Blockland. Switching between game modes and the shared simplicity of the games is very fun. Forming up a group of friends to play on a self-made server is also a great idea.I'm pretty sure that Garry's Mod would be a better option, but still, Blockland has it's own vibe to it to make it worth a try, so try the Demo from the official site before buying.

												I have played this game on and off since 2007. One of the coolest things back in the day was being part of a building clan. For the most part, those days are over with the exception of a few withstanding groups. However, the community (at least most of it) is still very good, and I'm sure new subcommunities will form with an influx of new people. The possibilities in this game are literally endless, especially with the advantage of the RTB Mod, which allows you to access a database of add-ons for your game as well as communicate with others who are currently in the game. It takes a bit of patience to master the controls, but success comes through persistence (though persistantly asking for admin in a server will get you kicked!!!).I can't wait to see what's in store for Blockland as far as new game-modes, mods, and people! Don't be a Blockhead... buy this game!			"

												The story of an ex-convict recently released from prison, out to get revenge on his oppresive captors. He does this in various ways; Petty vandilisim, assault, Pirate Ship Deathmatchs, etc. The game requires an intellectual approach to its many secrets and story branches.You must be patient with this game, as dying is something that will happen regularly and unexpectedly. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys story-rich games, with a deep narrative and a rich backdrop that immerses you completely. Upon starting the game, you will be greeted with some of the best graphics currently available to the gaming industry. However this is only a small part of the fun and excitement Blockland delivers.10/10 Would buy again.			"

However, you can still find enjoyment in it, but it can be difficult and I'm still deciding myself if it was worth it. I'm sure that this game was more popular a few year backs. Sadly, it faded away though. I wish it could come back because it has great potential. If your not intrested in the multiplayer though, I would still get it.			"

												Blockland is a complete Roblox killer. And I'm not saying that it's bad. It's a MUST GET. Blockland is a sandbox game (just like Garry's mod) where you create things with blocks. I know that may sound strange, kinda like Legos in a way. But that doesn't end there. There's addons (oh boy, you saw this one coming didn't you.). You can grab new addons from the Blockland Forms or RTB. Just look it up on google m8. And slap on those addons to the Blockland addon folder. Now you got more blocks! ......what's that? Weapons? Vehicles? Oh so this is like Garry's mod. Lovely! Yes, there are weapons and tools for you to build or fight in custom mini games. Vehicles for you to race against your friends, so much more to play with! Hmm, if this is like Garry's mod...is there game modes? Yes, yes there is. From Speedkart to Xmas to Tutorials to anything really, you can download more on the forms and RTB. You can even customize your own character too. Well, that wraps up what I'm gonna say about this game. I highly recommend you get this game to fulfill your creativity. It's way better than Roblox ya heard?			"

												I don't have any previous history of the game before it came to Steam, and really don't care about some of the politics that surround the title.  My opinions are based on my play experiences.  I don't think it's fair to compare this to LEGO in anyway.  The blocks in the game do not go together in the ways that real LEGO bricks do.  For example I never found a way to change the direction of studs (SNOT building).  And the selection of blocks is very minimal without installing a bunch of extra mods or add-ons.In fact, the game seems to require a certain amount of user-created material to be something other than demo or alpha quality.  So if you're just looking for a fun out-of-the-box experience, look elsewhere.			"

												The game is over-all a great game, I've been playing it since 2010. Yet I still can't necessarily reccomend it due to the lack of a friendly community. Everyone is a bit uptight and an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I would only buy it if you were to only play with friends. But over-all, don't buy it if you're looking forward to online mulitplayer, you will be dissapointed by it's lack of a friendly community. I was banned from 3 servers for going against their rules because they were completely ridiculous and trivial. I was once banned for asking if anyone was going to be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ the reason was because the host thought I outsmarted him (which I did) and made him look like a complete fool infront of his friends. I was again banned for griefing a game after I was disrespected several times for being polite and ""acting like the king of England"". This game is great, but for the love of god, avoid online multiplayer, only play with friends, you'll be much happier if you do that.			"

												i've basically grown up with this game. it's one of the best games i've ever played as far as overall experience goes. the community is one of the best i've ever seen. the modding capabilities are better than any game that i know of, and the modding community is helpful and generous. it says a lot when it's common practice for people to volunteer their help on mod projects with nothing in return. the people i've met on this game make up the majority of my friends list and you're all wonderful. from a gameplay point of view, it's one of the best sandboxes out there. the building works well and the eventing system opens up a world of capabilities, even on a vanilla install (if you know what you're doing). and with the mods available, a whole world of possibilities open up. i would recommend this game to anyone and everyone without any hesitation. if you don't have it, get it as soon as possible. five thumbs up, two out of two stars.

It's like TF2 with better and more classes and instead of fighting a different team, you fight one boss who is chosen depending on how much damage a player did to the previous evil boss.Lots of fun boss classes and don't judge it by it's lego-like childish-ness.

												Given this game has no boundries. It seems to be updated in its own way every day. People make new stuff, combine more stuff, etc etc. Many people play this game, as much as 170,000 now. No this game may not be protected with all types of security, but it has its own secure methods. Such as the Creator coming on to servers and revoking bad players (Revoking meaning he eats your account so you have to get a new one, that is if you still want to play the game).

												This game ate up my afternoons before the Steam release. This game is probably one of the best sandbox building block games I've played, probably even the best sandbox game I've played period. The base game has a ton of content, but mods add even more and I'm sure there's a mod for everyone. Multiplayer is fantastic with a huge variety of player-made gamemodes as well as a fun-loving, yet mature community. The visuals look gorgeous (Especially with shaders on.), the physics are a treat to see (Especially if you blow up a building made up entirely of small blocks.) and each server level has a completely different atmosphere. I absolutely love this game and I recommend you get it if you love sandbox games and the Lego-filled memories of your childhood.			"

												I've owned this game for six years and I can say that when I reach absolute boredom with all of the garbage-tier AAA titles that come out this is my first fallback.  There's always something to do whether it be building an elaborate city by myself, entering a trench TDM and completely dominating, or sitting enjoying my time with others. This game had so much potential when I first played it, and now I'm seeing these potentials become real game elements. The mod development group cranks out new stuff almost by the minute.  I've even released stuff myself. It's also really optimized and could literally be played on your grandmother's computer.I'm really impressed with everything Badspot has done with Blockland. I would guess he is probably swamped with things to do since this game has blown up on Steam, but he still takes the time to engage the community.  My hat is off to you, bro.Anyways, if you are looking for ""The Game"", look no further.10/10			"

												I have thoroughly played this and helped it's development for around 10 years now. This is not a game where you learn how to play it in a month. This game takes a while to master the controls and knowledge of it. It is probably the most flexible, while still remaining stable, sandbox game I have ever played in my lifetime. Yes, it may seem like Roblox's evil cousin or a Minecraft rip-off or whatever, but it has one thing each of those doesn't; A fun-loving and creative community. Each modder is a valuable member of the community, infact; a lot of dedicated people (regular everyday gaming people) have been recruited into the staff more often than you may think.People will play this for a few weeks, not like it, and turn it down. Which is fine, this game may not be for everyone, but the reason this takes a while to get used to is because there's really no other game like it. It's like stepping into high school for the first time. It's different. Yes, every game has it's share of bad sports, trolls, and idiots, but once you look into the community and spend some time to master the controls, you can literally do anything you want. This game is a First Person Shooter, Role-Playing Game, Arcade Game, and so much more. And for those of you who have already given up on the game, I ask you to give it one more shot, to spend time to know how to work the game, and really let your imagination go wild. Everything you see in the photo previews were all built by humans who started out in your shoes. There is really no limits. Every statement where people say ""If you can imagine it, you can build it"", are all true.			"

												Well after buying and playing this game for a while, I will say that I did indeed enjoy it. My only issue with this game is that after being in the player section in the main menu for a while, the game will freeze and then inevitably crash. It's a bit of a nuisance, but overall the game is superb. I used to be a fan of Roblox and this was a great way to get back into the sandbox-blocky-create-your-own-game style of games without actually having to deal with the angry 12 year olds on almost ALL of the servers. I do recommend this game. (if you like this sort of thing)			"

												Can't recommend it enough. I've played this on and off since 2008. Aside from building, there is always something new.The modding community is huge. Hell, the game practically revolves around it. Vanilla is nice, but any server you join is going to have lots of mods. From Team Deathmatches, to racing, to prison escapes, to building with some friends, there are many things to keep you busy.Development is always active, and with the new launcher introduced in Version 19, they're applied automatically and more frequently. There are always new content updates and bug fixes every once and a while. It's been like this for years, and doesn't seem to be slowing down.The graphics are good for a sandbox building game, but what more could you want right? Shadows and shaders have been a nice addition in Version 21, and anyone with a non-intergrated graphics card can at least run them on minimum. The game isn't very demanding at all. Aside from the studs, the bricks looks and act like your classic Lego blocks, and the minifigures have a nice, original design to them.In a nuthshell, this game is practically G-Mod in the style of Legos. And it can't get any better than that. If you're still unsure, there's a demo you can download to try out the game and mechanics yourself - aside from multiplayer. For an indie game that only costs twenty-dollars, you get a lot more than your money's worth.			"

												(9.2) Blockland is not just one of those generic, lego-style sandbox type of game. Blockland is different in every aspect, foremost with the community. This game has no boundaries, especially with the use of mods. You cannot undermine this game for its lego-style approach, because beyond that you have unraveled limitless, unique possibilities that could be expressed through many game styles and modes. The well-sized and expanding community is helpful and the developer does a superb job at connecting with his players. As well, it features TorqueScript, an easy scripting language. It's super-cheap for its value! My final premise on this title: This is an uncomparable, well-developed sandbox that is a definite must-buy for its pricing and community.  "

The game can be compared to the sandbox ""Garry's Mod"", which also centers on a player-driven system.Like Garry's Mod, this game is somewhat of a niche, yet because of it's marketed open-endedness and scope, as well as low price and system requirements has been marketed to mass public. And like Garry's Mod, this is a game for specific people, and not the mass market.The community has been accused of being focuses of drama and controversy and the forum and game policing has said to be flimsy at best, but this is a community driven game, again, like Garry's Mod. And on top of that, this game was developed in a time period in which indie games struggled quite a bit to get on their feet. This combined with the rare lifespan that this game has exhibbited has picked up a lot of baggage over the years, just like anything would. And the high social learning curve that comes with this game isn't exactly friendly to new players. What I mean is that each server is maintained and controlled be either a board of admins that the host has chosen to moderate and maintain the server, or a singular admin. How that admin wants to host and represent that server is up to them. People who like the hosts ideals will likely drift towards the servers with those admins, making sub-cultures in the game world.The best thing for a new player to do is find a server with friendly new players and slowly intigrate into the community, otherwise you will most likely irritate the sometimes easily irritatable inhabitance of the game.All in all, coming from a ""veteran"" player that watched this game grow and grow over the years, I'd say that it is enjoyable, so long as you can find a server community that you can intigrate with, you will have no problem with the community. As for the game, it's a high customisable sandbox game. That's pretty much the depth of it.			"

												A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far away, Eric ""Badspot"" Hartman casually experimented with the idea of making a lego-oriented game with the Torque Engine. You place lego bricks in a voxel world, drive brick cars, shoot weapons, destroy bricks with hammers, ski down slopes, etc... The kinds of things most kids like to imagine doing with legos.Today, the game has reached new heights compared to its early years. The creative side of Blockland has gone to new extremes with their endeavors. When you first enter the game, you might be disoriented at first. There is no direction; you just place and edit bricks, among other things. But stick around and explore, and the rewards will be greater every time. Build a house or other structure of your choice. Then build another; then another, and another. Improve your technique, and watch your skills improve as your builds become more elaborate and more detailed, realistic, and higher quality.Make the bricks do things with the Wrench Event system, whereupon you might begin crafting brick-event computers and contraptions, sci fi setups, RP games, and countless other possibilities yet to be explored...Explore online servers and see what the other players are doing; of all the things you might find, locally famous examples include: A 1:1 scale exact detail replica of the RMS Titanic, giant six-story spaceships, high-detailed yachts, realistic houses both vintage and modernesque, science labs, roleplay worlds, giant dragonflies, arenas, etc...  you'll find many visual examples of Blockland creations through this link: http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=247866.0, the Blockland trailor, and of course on online servers.The game's add-on system is among the most prominent features of the game. You might consider searching out and downloading custom bricks, vehicles, tools, gamemodes, events, etc as well to enhance your potential. Most add-ons may be found in the Add-ons section of the Blockland forums.In all, this game will be well worth the money if you stick around and explore the possibilities. The game's path is yours.-----PS: Before you step in, beware: The Blockland community is, in general, exceptionally... er... badly influenced. There are nice people out there, but it is advised that you use your own judgement to find them, and beware that dwelling too long in the general sea of the Blockland Forum and many Blockland internet servers, your sanity may be at risk. I urge you not to let this effect your impression of the game itself.			"

There is also people on the servers that are vary polite and will gladly help anyone that ask for it; even on the Forms. Over the time I play, Mods became more and more Inportant of gameplay. That being said, This game should be Recomended for people who Likes mods and like createing games out of blocks, one block at a time.			"

												I tried a demo for the game years ago, and had a bunch of fun with so little. Now I have the full game, and the possibilities are pretty much limitless. There is so much to do and/or create with Blockland. If you had a passion for Legos as a child, you might enjoy this game... a lot. It has the building mechanics of Legos, with the gameplay and versatility of Garry's Mod. The only setback for this game's potential is the community. There are always good people, but the majority seem to be pretty immature, but it's kind of expected for the type of game. Overall, I think it's a great game to have. It's very fun to play with friends! Also, feel free to check out my basketball server if you decide to buy.			"

												Very fun game. Reminiscent of the Lego bricks you've once known and loved combined with an edge that makes you think the Garry's Mod development teams had something to do with it. A good time killer, and something fun to play with a group of friends. Something also to note is that the community can usually be pretty helpful as well as friendly. Other times, they can be kind of turdish, but hey, all games have their nipple-twisters. The thing I like most about the game is that the building and ""scripting"" is very straight forward, making it easy to do what you really want to do with the game. Let your creative mind run wild.

Feels like Legos. You can make your own gamemodes using minigames, and with so much space you can build anything. Buy da game. It is worth ten dollars. Bots are so fun, too.

												Ah this is such a great game. I've had this game for over 5 years and put in over 1000 hours into it before it came to steam, it's the best sandbox game I've ever played because there is just so much you can do. I may have been just a kid when I first bought this game, but it is still amazing, I would reccommend this game over Garry's Mod because of it's great build system, gamemodes, and events system, which allows you to manipulate items and do amazing things. For a simple example, if you use events on a block, you could make it so that by touching the block you go flying into the air with your butt on fire. There are numerous possibilities with this game, it's simeoultaneously a FPS shooter, a 3rd Person Shooter, a racing simulator, a Dogfight simulator, a Quake-Like Deathmatch arena, a City RPG, a Jail RPG, and anything you can possibily think of. This is all thanks to the numerous enjoyable addons created by the community such as different gamemodes and addons. Very very underrated for it's quality as a game. People try to compare this game Roblox and then subsequently judge it based on that terrible game, but this should not be the case, because first of all it was created long before Roblox, second it has a much better community, third it has a much better building system, and fourth it has much more possibilities in terms of addons, gamemodes, and maps.

												(9.2) Blockland is not just one of those generic, lego-style sandbox type of game. Blockland is different in every aspect, foremost with the community. This game has no boundaries, especially with the use of mods. You cannot undermine this game for its lego-style approach, because beyond that you have unraveled limitless, unique possibilities that could be expressed through many game styles and modes. The well-sized and expanding community is helpful and the developer does a superb job at connecting with his players. As well, it features TorqueScript, an easy scripting language. It's super-cheap for its value! My final premise on this title: This is an uncomparable, well-developed sandbox that is a definite must-buy for its pricing and community.  "

												Now, dont get me wrong. I LOVE this game, but with the influx of 5 year olds and the fact that Badspot (the game's developer) said that he wasn't updating the game further, it's gone down in quality. As far as servers go, you MIGHT find a good one here or there, but its mostly bad roleplay servers run by abusive admins.But if you can get passed all that, it's a GREAT game. But I wouldn't recommend it to newcomers.			"

												Blockland Is a great game. It's a virtual sandbox that combines the community mods of Gmod with the building style found in LEGO brick along with some decent lighting! The thing is, our community is dying. We need numbers (players)  now more than ever to bring this game out of an unfotunately impending demise. I paid for this game back when it was 20 US dollars, and even at that price, I believed my money was well spent. Thsi game has given me some  good experiences and great friends over the 4 years I have played it. I can't possibly recommend it enough. We just need more players to bring fresh, creative ideas back to the game. If you're still uncomfortable to pay the 10 US dollars, just wait for a sale, then the purchase will definitely be worth it.			"

												I'll be very simple with the review since it's not a game that you need to over-complicate or go too in-depth with the details of. Blockland is a lego-like sandbox game in which you can create and design any kind of world or server you could ever desire. The game can be compared to the sandbox ""Garry's Mod"", which also centers on a player-driven system.Like Garry's Mod, this game is somewhat of a niche, yet because of it's marketed open-endedness and scope, as well as low price and system requirements has been marketed to mass public. And like Garry's Mod, this is a game for specific people, and not the mass market.The community has been accused of being focuses of drama and controversy and the forum and game policing has said to be flimsy at best, but this is a community driven game, again, like Garry's Mod. And on top of that, this game was developed in a time period in which indie games struggled quite a bit to get on their feet. This combined with the rare lifespan that this game has exhibbited has picked up a lot of baggage over the years, just like anything would. And the high social learning curve that comes with this game isn't exactly friendly to new players. What I mean is that each server is maintained and controlled be either a board of admins that the host has chosen to moderate and maintain the server, or a singular admin. How that admin wants to host and represent that server is up to them. People who like the hosts ideals will likely drift towards the servers with those admins, making sub-cultures in the game world.The best thing for a new player to do is find a server with friendly new players and slowly intigrate into the community, otherwise you will most likely irritate the sometimes easily irritatable inhabitance of the game.All in all, coming from a ""veteran"" player that watched this game grow and grow over the years, I'd say that it is enjoyable, so long as you can find a server community that you can intigrate with, you will have no problem with the community. As for the game, it's a high customisable sandbox game. That's pretty much the depth of it.			"

												I've wasted plenty of hours on this game because of Tezuni's Prison Escape server, I went from a normal user to a mod over a long period of time. Hell, it's still great too.Also, as for other game modes and servers. You're bound to run into the boss battle server, good if you want to play as TF2 classes against a player who picks a boss to fight against everyone else. There are other classes to play as too, but you can find those out yourself.Other servers range from speedkarting where you're bound to die plenty of times before you see the finish line, building forts with weapons, FNAF fandom crap, and city servers that get fun when the cops are asleep, all of these types of servers never last too long.So, that's really all I've learned from playing this game.

												It a lot like garry's mod. I don't like to build on this so I recommend if you really like to build on minecraft you should get it. I ike to build on garry's mod more... a lot more. I like to use this for multiplayer because so many gamemodes that are fun. This game is for people who like to build a lot or want a lot of different gamemodes. And there is a lot of mods you can get. For the price of $10 it is worth it.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												I used to play Blockland back WAY before it was Greenlit. It's still fun to this day, but if you want to play Blockland, keep a few things in mind:1. The community has gone on a bit of a decline. Blockland has many jerks in it, but it's still much better to play multiplayer. If you want to play Blockland, persuade some friends to get the game as well.2. The base game alone is somewhat bland. You can still do many things, but it's MUCH better with add-ons! Just look up how to get add-ons, and you'll find plenty of guides!			"

												This game is like Minecraft in a Lot of Ways. Please don't hate. It's heavily based around building, It's Heavily Moddable, and It's quite Boring without mods. But with mods, This game is a f*cking blast.Some people say this game is dead. Those people have no idea what the word ""Dead"" means, apparently. This game still has an average of 200 people playing a day. Blockland isn't Dead, It's more like in a coma after a Car Crash RTB Shutting down.After about 4-5 years of playing, This game is still my favourite Game.10/10, Would get banned from the forums Again.

												Create your own buildings using bricks.Engage in multiplayer battles that take place in a vivid block world.Interact with gamers all over the globe and compete or cooperate.Block games have received quite a lot of popularity since Minecraft appeared 5 years ago. The market is actually invaded by a lot of games that look like similar just to capitalize on its success, but in order to be successful in the gaming world you do need to be innovative, and that’s what Blockland tries to deliver. This is basically a game where you can use bricks to create the game world in any way imaginable.Since Blockland is an online game at heart, you will have to rely on other people to create the game world how you want, or each player can create its own region and defend it against the attackers.There are also some situations or game modes in which you won’t build anything, since the world is already built. Instead, you will have the opportunity to explore the world and defeat the other persons you encounter, while also avoiding zombies and other NPC creatures. The possibilities really are endless in this game and most of the time the people that play it will choose what to do and where to go, since there are literally no restrictions whatsoever, and that is truly important.While the buildings in Blockland don’t seem to be affected by gravity or physics, you do have the option and tools to create a world that is very realistic and unique.The controls in the game are very solid and they give you a great feeling and appeal, which is surely important. Furthermore, you also have a lot of multiplayer systems into the game, including a player hosted server system which allows players to develop their own world and invite their friends to play.Bricks can be created for a certain event or programmed and there’s even a unique add-on system that really makes the game shine. The community for this particular title is rather large, much larger than you would expect and, of course, there are some situations in which you are not welcome to the server.Even so, with the help of the forum and numerous other additions, Blockland does offer a lot of ways to communicate, including the in-game chat. This makes the game a very good one for kids that want to be creative and come up with something of their own.Blockland is the crowning achievement of the block game mania, as it delivers all the tools needed by the gamers to create their own worlds out of blocks. Yes, it will surely eat up a lot of your time, but in the end the game is well worth your time, since it has so many features and things you can do in it. Replayability is at its best here and it’s guaranteed that no two sessions will be the same. It’s surely much more than you could hope for, and we certainly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in block building games.			"

												The community is what you make it, development has been in a slump recently but this game is complete and has provided a lot of replayability and room for creativity for me and a lot of the friends I made on this game (note I have few hours on steam version but likely a few hundred before I got it on Steam). Many of the negative reviews are people complaining about the developer not consistently putting out free updates consistently even for years after release, despite a strong modding community, and these people also tend to be problem users that stir up drama with developers are other players on the forum. This game IS definitely worth it, and I dare someone to tell me why its not. There is some cruddy servers but there is also the occasionally great server, just like most sandbox multiplayer games. If you're remotely interested in a lego based sandbox building game, get this game.			"

												Imagine that Blockland is a pokemon. No constant updates ouch. Down to 70 HP. Shutdown of rtb ouch critical hit. Down to 20 HP. Wow, game came to steam, use a potion. More updates? No... Ouch. Down on 20 HP again. Great community, where we know each other... Use a potion. Great servers? Use another potion. Blockland has been poisoned. Each year blockland dies.... I bought BL when it was for 20$. It was full of life, but now... It has 40 HP left... Only 40 hp. I do reccomend it but it's dying.			"

												I've spent hours upon hours building everything from boats to castles to spaceships, and playing games with other people online, most likely making Blockland my second-most-played game of all time. This was a long, long time before the game appeared on Steam, however, so you'll just have to take my word for it. I have yet to find another sandbox building game that gives you the level of freedom that Blockland does, with an endless supply of user-created add-ons in the form of blocks, game-modes, and more. LEGO sets were one of my favorite toys as a child, so being able to not only have endless bricks to build with but also the ability to explore my creations up-close as a small minifigure and interact with them was a dream come true.While some people will use their imagination to bring physical form to whatever they can think up, my forte was always recreating things from other media. Not the most creative thing in the world, but it was the most enjoyable for me. At various points I worked on reconstructing playable versions of Team Fortress 2's ctf_2fort, Pokemon's Kanto region, and the entirety of Portal, as well as a large-scale model of Halo's Rocket Launcher. My only regret is that I'm not very good at finishing what I've started, as the Rocket Launcher was the only thing that ever reached total completion.Most people tend to complain about the userbase, but it's only as bad as any other place composed mostly of people in grade-school who haven't been a part of an online community before. Certain problematic users will insist this game is bad, but only because they've been punished for misbehaving time after time after time. Overall, it just takes time to adjust.			"

												I first discovered Blockland in 2009, and I fell in love with it. Combining my hours on and off of Steam I have accumulated some 2.4 thousand hours of gameplay. The building system is complex as hell, and if you're not good with Legos then this really isn't for you. The game's fanbase has largely died out due to the death of RTB and maps (just go on the Blockland forums and look at old gallery topics or soemthing). Most of the servers that other people have started are cancer.I think my point is that if you can have fun on your own, making your own games, building your own maps, hosting your own original servers, this is the game for you. If you've come because you want to♥♥♥♥♥♥around in prebaked maps and have laughs, search elsewhere.			"

												this is a very interesting game, but in a good way.To start off, Blockland has a very uniqe building process, you use num pad keys to move blocks, traditional WASD keys for movement and a simple menu of blocksin a nut shell its a lego game but its better(my opinion).i think its defenatly a great game to play, but the only problem is that the mods are hard to get(then again ive never installed a mod before so im new)other than that its a great game!

												Five years of Blockland (3 years of activity):I've been playing Blockland since some of earlier days, starting in v10.  Over the whole course of that time, I've been a fairly active user.  From the time I joined in 2008 until April 2009, I was learning the ropes, how to behave, proper etiquette, etc.  In April, Blockland was un-installed when I was grounded, and I slipped away from it.  In early 2012, after several half-hearted attempts to get it back, I got it working again.  I've made a fool of myself on many occasions, but I've contributed in many ways too, mostly to in-game servers.  Blockland is definitely one of the best games I have ever played/owned in my life.Note to new Steam users: I've noticed that a lot of people have probably discriminated against you for being new.  Please don't be discouraged by this.  The majority of our community is not like that, and is more than willing to help you with anything you might need.  One of the best ways to cut the discrimination is to change your name.  You start with a default name where (*) are the ID numbers (Blockhead*****).  At the bottom of the title screen, hit the button saying 'Name' and enter any name of your choosing (assuming that it is available).- XR_7 (50690) "

												This is a really good sandbox game! It's flexible (not as flexible as ROBLOX, though), and it's quite easy to set up certain game-modes. There's a large add-on archive which has lots of things that'll appeal to you. You can create your own add-on with some scripting knowledge (lua, I believe), and a graphics software such as Blender. It can range from new zombie types to guns, to vehicles, to items like Night Vision goggles!There's only one real issue that I may have noticed. The developer can be quite rude at times (sources are from the reviews + screenshots), and that the game really isn't updated often anymore. You don't really need updates to enjoy the game, though! Add-ons serve a large purpose.			"

Prision Escape, Fort Wars, FreeBuild, CTF, Diesease, Murder Mystrey, Bot Wars, Role-play severs, Speedkart and Deathrace are all good examples. Some are modded, some arent. Another good part of the game is the mods are automatically downloaded.Edited in for popular demand: Minigames and eventing are amazing. Start up a mini game and make it the way you want. Turn the mini game to a capture the flag ot even a City RPG.Eventing is even better. Event a brick so when you click on it, it plays a song or even tells you something. Make hidden rooms with disappering bricks, Make your bots look like you, Make traps so people fly into the air and so much more that i cant remember.Sadly, on mac, It is a bit glitchy. You cant see any faces, when you start up the game it asks you to setup your settings and your player always resets.Singleplayer is mostly good for nothing, unless you have some fun mods or you just want to mess around with bots or something.It is still the funnest game ive ever played in history of games ive played. EDIT: e.g. ive played 200 hours of it. (and none of my other games have come close to that.)Mods are hard to get, there are some websites that have archives of the epic website, RTB. (that is closed) In all its such a fun game, but there are a few sad reasons of not to get it. I'd reccomend it to people that like: sandbox, building, fps, loling, role-playing, zombies and tf2 like games!!			"

												Currently Blockland is my favorite sandbox game just because of the sheer amount of stuff you can do. There are alot of gamemodes, some better than others. But what makes it worth the money you WILL spend on it is the building and hilariously random stuff that can happen.			"

												Blockland may look like a Minecraft or Roblox clone at first glance to some people,but it really isn't and it in itself is much more than that. So BL is a building game first made in 2004 in the V0002 state, the retail version was then released in 2007 with the latest version being V21. Have you've ever played with LEGO's as a kid or built something with them? Did you ever have fun with them? If yes, then Blockland is the game for you. The game allows you to build with a virtually unlimted amount of bricks (There's a 256,000 brick limt,but you can set your own limt on your own server). It also even features an in-game eventing system that allows you to do cool stuff with your bricks like make a door that open and closes or a light switch. The modding community is also pretty good with a good number of brick packs, vehicles, colorsets, music, and etc. The community itself isn't the best, but there really isn't a perfect community out there anyway. You may meet some bad players here and there,but if you stay away from the bad side of the community you'll be fine. The graphics are very blocky and legolike giving a very nice look especially for a old 2003 engine.There are shaders in the game,but they look very jaggy and bad and they're also very poorly optimized at it too.If you want to there are modifications that can help you make the shadows look smoother,but you'll need a great PC to get it done. I would really recomend this game to anybody if you like building games and don't worry you'll really get your money's worth, I've spent at least about 400hrs (With my old blid and steam blid combined) on the game and haven't stopped yet.Note: When you first get the game I would highly recommend getting RTB.

												Based on a (somewhat true) story.Once upon a time,there was a blockhead called Toastee,he looked like a zombie wearing a grey sweater and beanie. He went on a cityRP and he dressed like a normal person,i decided to go raiding houses. An adming saw what i was doing and instantly gave the job of Criminal to me.Thats when operation 'Food Corner' was in process. I invited some friends and told them to do what i do. I got enought money to get a gun. So instead of sneaking into houses,i rang the doorbell and pointed a gun at a guy while everyone else took stuff. We would all share.Until ""BERRIES"" decided to take my cut.I then decided to Akimbo him in the face and take his cut. Yay.He then lived a normal life since. I robbed him often with my friends ""Whip Crem"" and ""Buttr"" as we enjoyed eating the pizza he never bought for us.Then Buttr decided to join the PD and grab a gun. We killed him on the spot.Whip Crem decided to lay low,so it was just me for 5 ingame days.I robbed Buttr and BERRIES for the whole 5 days,once a day each.Whip crem then went into my house with a Rocket launcher an admin gave him.I shot him on spot,got banned for 1 minute.Came back with all data saved,except for...My house!I went and got another friend (Stan Marshmellow) to hack this popstand admin known only as ""Goodspot"",most likely a fan of Badspot,the creator of Blockland.Problem solved.Or so we thought.Stan Marshmellow didn't know that Goodspot was a friend of Badspot. He was gone too.0 Friends,10 armoured cars,50 boxes of pizza. 10,000,000 Ingame dollars.Good trade.			"

												I have played Blockland for years now, experiencing many good and bad times. To be very honest, I had loved Blockland so much before steam and the version 21 (if you know what version I am talking about, the one that has removed maps). It might not be because of steam nor version 21, but this game was my teenagehood and I still play it. This game would be my all time, top 5 favorite games of all time because this game is not a competetive game if you do not want it to be. You choose whatever you want to do, whenever you want, experiencing it with friends online or just play on your own time to yourself. You can add many interesting toold, features, decals, and more to spice up your games' features. You can add these weapons and tools made by your fellow community from the forums or ingame with the rtb client. Anyways, this game would strongly be recommended by me as this game makes me feel like I am not only building with legos, but creating the creations I have dreamt of since I was young.			"

												I have had Blockland for the pat 5 years since v12. People will tell you the problem with this is the building system and truthfully you just need to get use to numb pad. Its the 3rd part in learning how to plant bricks in the tutorial where you put it in the small hole (that's what she said hehe) but really mastering numb pad is key to building and in-fact, makes it easier than most games since if you miss you can just press a button to move it in place. I am a builder and I am proud. I highly suggest you buy this game since its the game that keeps on giving. I have played for 5 years and I shall go another 5. P.S. if you feel like a reason not to get this game is the community remember the steam community will become the majority so all problems found in it will practically cease to exist. P.S.S. I request you call the community blockheads since blocklanders sounds dumb IMO.			"

												This game is disliked for one reason: because it is compared to Minecraft and Roblox, two very popular building games. Now, comparing this game to Minecraft is like comparing cows to pigs. It really doesn't make sense except for them being in the same category of game genres. I can see how you would compare this game to Roblox, but even then there are a LOT of differences. Roblox might be better in a way that you can have groups, dress easily, and what you can do on Roblox is limitless. But, Blockland is also limitless. One of the good parts about Blockland, is that it was entirely built by the community and everybody who has it has loved it. Yeah, it will continue having updates, but those updates won't change how fun Blockland is and it's style of gameplay. Hell, who cares if Blockland doesn't have groups, you can make your own that is based on Roleplaying, military, and so on. The skin designer is really easy to use and you can make some awesome decals for your shirt, pants, head, and everywhere. I recommend Blockland to anyone at the price it is at, because in my opinion, it is one hell of a game.			"

It was 5 against one.He'll never win, I thought.He'll never escape, I thought.He'll never survive, I thought.I thought wrong.He managed to start a full-scale riot, him and his army of offenders. They broke all 7 of my steel doors with their bare fists, escaping into the yard. They were almost out. I quickly hired God-knows-how-many dog handlers, in a valiant effort to hold them back until the authorities get here. I managed to keep the tsunami of prisoners back, put the prison on lockdown and finally the armed police got here.I did it, I stopped the riot.But then I saw that one particular cell was empty. Then I realized..LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEROOOOOOOOOOOY JEEEENKINS!54/11 would plastic fork again.			"

												yeah its funEDIT:I've played this game for a while, and I've decided to revisit it after not playing it for a while, and it made me realize how awesome it is. The first thing I'd like to express is that this is not Minecraft, and it is not Roblox. It is different from those. This is a completely different game. You can build actual lego builds using this, and it has a friendly ""eventing system"", which is essentially programming, which lets you bring interactivity to your buildings.  I think this is a good game, it has a generally nice community, and it has a range of servers for you to choose from. There are also quite a few mods in the game, and new mods are developed pretty often. I definately reccomend it if you enjoy sandbox or building type games.			"

												Blockland is one of those games where it is what you make of it. There is no floor, and no ceiling for how good this game is, and how good it can be. I've had this game for about ten years now, and have played it for at least a month each year, and plenty more inbetween, although it has grown old for me now, it will always be my first and most favorite sandbox game of all time, with an add-on system rivaled only by Garry's mod you can't really go wrong with it.Despite having a rather toxic community that ressemble that of LoL and Dota, it actually has a very friendly add-on sharing community, where people often take requests and listen to feedback. The servers range from absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥to games within games, showing how diverse, yet repetitive a game can be, and having such a robust building system it opens a gateway to many, if not infinite, ways of producing content for yourself and the community.

												Woah... I gotta say, this is actually quite a fun sandbox game. This game may look cheesy, but hey it's actually not that bad... At first I thought ""Meh, I might give the game a meh rating"" but after I played it..... it was actually quite fun.Having to be able to build anything whatever you freaking want with blocks that look like legos..... Sure! Why not?Although, there are 2 downsides to the game. One, is that some of the controls feel a bit akward. (The good side though is that you do get used to it after awhile. Still, it feels werid to me atleast.) Second, the graphics don't look... all that great (even if you have the shaders on MAX.)Overall, this is a really fun sandbox game and I highly recommend it. Even though some of the controls are a bit akward and the graphics aren't that good. It's still a good game. And if you have any friends on here, it's a great mutliplayer experince. Their is also other gamemodes as well. Such as SpeedKarts, Deathmatch, and so on. So if you don't wanna be sandboxing all day you could just play those as well. Good game, fun experince. I hope you all and to my friends will enjoy it! ^-^8/10			"

												This pains me to even type up such a review, becuase I've played Blockland way back in 2008, along with Roblox, which used to be my crack. While Roblox is now a slot machine, it still maintains to update itself in such a fashion. Its now more sleek and modern that Blockland here, and that normally wouldn't be a problem, but the problem is that this the year of 2014.I'm not saying that you can't release games like Shovel Knight, but from playing Blockland in 2008, to actually buying it on Steam in 2014, not a single damn thing has hardly been changed/updated. The only major updates have actually removed cult hit maps due to ""incompatibilities"". Guys, thats the equlivent of Garry completly removing construct from GMod... but again, it still wouldn't matter. Why? The whole reason why Blockland has failed: Community. You see, if Garry decided to remove famous content, the COMMUNITY would be like ""Time to fire up some Source SDK"" in  Blockland? Nope.To site an excellent review from DarkByte97;""The community for this game is virtually nonexistant (unless you're dying to be in a commuinty full of autocratic ♥♥♥♥♥). I have not seen a gaming community full of more hostile and irrational people in my life. This is why all of our servers have nothing good.""Amen brother. Server after server, you'll meet some very arrogent people within the ""community"". Want to find some advice on subject matters that genuinely need answering? ""Lol Roblox feg go frack urself lawl go suck Builderman's stud loL!!11!"" The community sites Roblox as a terrible game, yet does nothing for their beloved game to actually help stand out against a superior platform for block building. What about Gameplay? Surely thats half-way decent... Building is... absolutley awful. Where you have a entire keyboard and mouse to use to construct your ""uber amazing"" projects, you use a numpad... its a awkard and seemingly unnecessary game mechanic to learn. Why can't I just simply right click to place a block? No, you HAVE to use the numpad, and if you don't, then you're too stupid. Again, age has been an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ to this game, so clunky controls come with it.EDIT 1: You can rebind keys if you find the numpad off settingWhat about mods? Yeah, it supports them, and there are some good ones out there... on a site that shut down a couple of months ago. Yup. Awesome right? There are archives out there however, but still isn't as great as RTB.But hands down, the WORST part about Blockland is not the game itself, as old as it may be, but what surrounds it. The developer's complete ignorance and the communities lazy boy style of support, there's no water in Blocklands well, and its a damn shame becuase it has such amazing potential. I got lucky, I only bought this for a buck or two during the summer sale, but it was hardly worth that. If ""Badspot"" even decides to update Blockland with Steam Workshop, (he said he would, but that was a long time ago) maybe we'll see some cool stuff, and that the Steam community will do what the ocean did to Atlantis, and layer over the arrogent Blocktards, and shove some fire into Blockland's cold, dead heart.

												This pains me to even type up such a review, becuase I've played Blockland way back in 2008, along with Roblox, which used to be my crack. While Roblox is now a slot machine, it still maintains to update itself in such a fashion. Its now more sleek and modern that Blockland here, and that normally wouldn't be a problem, but the problem is that this the year of 2014.I'm not saying that you can't release games like Shovel Knight, but from playing Blockland in 2008, to actually buying it on Steam in 2014, not a single damn thing has hardly been changed/updated. The only major updates have actually removed cult hit maps due to ""incompatibilities"". Guys, thats the equlivent of Garry completly removing construct from GMod... but again, it still wouldn't matter. Why? The whole reason why Blockland has failed: Community. You see, if Garry decided to remove famous content, the COMMUNITY would be like ""Time to fire up some Source SDK"" in  Blockland? Nope.To site an excellent review from DarkByte97;""The community for this game is virtually nonexistant (unless you're dying to be in a commuinty full of autocratic ♥♥♥♥♥). I have not seen a gaming community full of more hostile and irrational people in my life. This is why all of our servers have nothing good.""Amen brother. Server after server, you'll meet some very arrogent people within the ""community"". Want to find some advice on subject matters that genuinely need answering? ""Lol Roblox feg go frack urself lawl go suck Builderman's stud loL!!11!"" The community sites Roblox as a terrible game, yet does nothing for their beloved game to actually help stand out against a superior platform for block building. What about Gameplay? Surely thats half-way decent... Building is... absolutley awful. Where you have a entire keyboard and mouse to use to construct your ""uber amazing"" projects, you use a numpad... its a awkard and seemingly unnecessary game mechanic to learn. Why can't I just simply right click to place a block? No, you HAVE to use the numpad, and if you don't, then you're too stupid. Again, age has been an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ to this game, so clunky controls come with it.EDIT 1: You can rebind keys if you find the numpad off settingWhat about mods? Yeah, it supports them, and there are some good ones out there... on a site that shut down a couple of months ago. Yup. Awesome right? There are archives out there however, but still isn't as great as RTB.But hands down, the WORST part about Blockland is not the game itself, as old as it may be, but what surrounds it. The developer's complete ignorance and the communities lazy boy style of support, there's no water in Blocklands well, and its a damn shame becuase it has such amazing potential. I got lucky, I only bought this for a buck or two during the summer sale, but it was hardly worth that. If ""Badspot"" even decides to update Blockland with Steam Workshop, (he said he would, but that was a long time ago) maybe we'll see some cool stuff, and that the Steam community will do what the ocean did to Atlantis, and layer over the arrogent Blocktards, and shove some fire into Blockland's cold, dead heart.

												0/10 - It's OK.No, haha, actually this game is truly amazing. Especially now, for only four bloody dollars! That's a steal! After playing it for now over 1000 hours, I can attest to the fact that this is probably one of the best games I've ever played. If you like building with legos, and even architecture in general, you will really love this game! If you get a little bored, I definitely encourage you to invite some friends!			"

That's the best way to describe it.All the maps are built piece-by-piece and the graphics are beautiful if you can run full shaders.10/10; I recommend this game to anyone and everyone.			"

It's not dead a good amount of people still play it and there's a community supporting it and roblox is full of hackers and spoiled kids think that they are better than everybody. This game I definitely recommend it it is my favorite game of all time extremely good and you can download addons and play all sorts of games online or make your own game and with events you can do whatever you want with in game scripting definitely recommend it to everyone who loves build and is creative.10/10 would buy this again.

												Wow. I never actually thought that I'd see a building game that got my attention. The grahpics are amazing, the animations are appealing. But, I have to be honest, the community is just..terrible. Depending on who it is, or where he/she is from, it doesn't make a make a big change or impact on the community. But, appart from that, on single-player its actually pretty peaceful. You can make ideas for your server that you're ""going"" to make, or just have fun freebuilding. Basically, this game is similar to minecraft but with a different building style. I thought you might want to read this before you actually get into the game, so you have a little notion of what you're doing. The building style uses the Numpad keys, 123456789 and 0, the Numpad keys move the brick to where you want it to go, without clicking somewhere and it goes. Overall-review: 9/10. I like the game, but the community just bad. But, I have not listed all the details about Blockland, you can read about it in different reviews. The one ""A.W.E.S.O.M -4000"" posted is a little more helpful. Thank you for your time.			"

But Blocky.  You are able to spawn an entire empty world and make something from your own creation. Everything is unlocked from the start and no resources are neccessary to obtain. There are different game modes. Like treasure hunting, Pvp, Jumping platform and some others. The game is not offering alot.It is a weaker version of Minecraft. Even more childy.Other things.Only purchase with a discount.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10			"

												I've played Blockland ever since V15, and I'd loved it every single minute. Sure I had some times where things didn't go well for me playing this game, but I was always able to pull through my problems in the game. I loved every single bit of detail coming from maps (back in V20 and below), shaders and shadows, and every single mod that was created from global Blockland players from around the world. I've made great friends, and introduced friends to this game, they loved it very much as well. Also thanks to this game, I went from not only just a player of this game, I went to a person who's really addicted to this game, and can't stop playing. I also finally learned how to make mods in certain categories too! Everyone loves the mods that i've made too.Badspot, you've done a very well done on making and progressing this game to satisfaction! Congratulations, and I absoulutely recommend this game to all those people who have creative, fun, and imaginitive minds.~NightHawk (BL_ID 22670)			"

												tl;dr don't touch this game with a 10 foot pole.To start- Personal Problems- Gameplay Problems- The ForumsBefore you readI cannot recommend this game. Before I start this off, I'd like to address the 1,000 hours thing. Most of my hours are from either from me leaving the game open for my friends (partially due to the fact that blockland on steam has no dedicated support, and lacking a client made me deal with doing this for a bit), dealing with my friends playing this game, or actually enjoying 1-2 gamemodes that are put out on the game that are pretty much non existent now. I have a love hate relationship with this game, you can make something done so well, working through the games pretty dated limitations, to be utterly destroyed by the community in any way possible, because if one problem is apparent, then everyone will try to exploit and break the system you've created. I mean sure that can go for everything, right? Well not like how the community treats it. You're the bad guy if the system is partially flawed, not the people actively trying to break your system. I have been on the fence of making this review for a good 6 months or so, mostly due to how I feel about the game and the community as said from above.Personal Problems inbound, Community TooOh, I know you! You're that jerk on the forum who hosted that one server!I don't think I want to host it ever again with how the community lashed out at me, it doesn't matter if I'm the victim at this point, here's my reasoning for why I say this: If you look at the previous works with my friends, I'm not involved, I'm not claiming to make everything, I'm trying to stay away from the spotlight because I outright don't deserve it. That's why I'm not the poster for these things, I'm not handling hosting an the event, and I'm not in charge of most of what's happening. I'm not in charge of any of this♥♥♥♥♥♥other than posting updates (which I didn't even do entirely), the formatting for threads, and music for our events. I don't want to pin the blame on others, because they don't deserve it, but this was outrageous. Now, during the event one of our events broke, spamming music. You know what we had to do? Restart the server. Oh, it's a tragedy, right? How dare we restart the server because something I HAD NO CONTROL OVER, broke. You know what happens then? a good 50+ people start collectively ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on me when again, I HAD NO CONTROL OVER IT. I had blame pinned on me for no reason, and the community is downright ignorant.Oh, but you act like a prick!!I don't want to take part in the community for the most part anymore, if I ever go on the game again it's because of my friends motives, and anything I do towards the community I do if I really feel like it's needed. I'm not saying my actions back in the past are justified because I hate the image I made for myself, but if nobody is willing to give me even a chance to act like a competent person then why even try? If I come back under a different name, people will find who I am and continue ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on me for something I did. It's not even worth my time, either. I don't want to deal with a community that actively attacks people in and outside of the community if they have a disability, I don't want associate with a community that acts this awful towards people, it's petty. I understand  I haven't been the best person around in the community, but even if I decided to change, nobody would give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's easier to act like a♥♥♥♥♥♥back unprovoked and act ignorant because that would get someone banned faster.If you hate the community, why have you been apart of it for so long?I have just outright tolerated it, but it has been the forum that has kept a lot of people towards the game for awhile, and getting off of it has been a hard time, but finally saying I don't want anything to do with that place anymore feels welcoming due to how awful the community can be sometimes. Toleration doesn't mean that I like it, though. I have just put up with the community, nothing more, nothing less until recently.Gameplay ProblemsWhat do you mean 1-2 gamemodes you've enjoyed? Wouldn't you recommend the game for that?I have 1,000 hours on this game, I've played a majority the game has to offer, and I'm not going to be the generic ""the game isn't fun anymore"" type of person. You have to actively sift through the♥♥♥♥♥♥on the master list to find games that are actually enjoyable, and a good 90% of the time there's nothing to offer. By the chance there is something fun to play, the community again attacks whatever me or my friends do because we're a group of like 6-7 people at a time. You know, because that many people is threatening and if we have power that one person has to constantly annoy us because they want to ""join us"" and mess everything up, and when they don't get their way they throw a ♥♥♥♥♥ fit and attack us whenever they can. This has happened so many times it's just outright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I'm sick and tired of this happening constantly.What do you mean limited?The game came out like 10 years ago, the game is limited and has not had a big update in what, three years?! (3/13/17) What's there to play for? Nothing will be new and the community isn't treating the game that well either.One mistake? How so?The game is overall broken, there is so much broken to the point of where you can get out of maps that you have built. For example, you build something in a cube format, you can glitch and jump out through the walls and has never been fixed. You have to use zonebricks as a solution to this, and the downside to that? No water bricks. The game is also very very broken. If you sat down to play speedkart for an hour, I assure you that you have been shot away by the awful physics at least 5 times at a minimum. You have to work in the games awful limitations, and fix the games awful problems to manage to host one thing decent, mess up something or don't lock it down fully? Don't expect your server up for more than an hour.Oh, but you still enjoyed it!That doesn't mean I'll ever want others to play this game. Just because I have the patience to sit through and sift through god awful gamemodes is beyond the normal persons attention span.Deny it all you want, the community is declining. (Community plays a heavy role)Sorry to break it to everyone, but Blockland isn't what it used to be. I joined pretty late compared to others, but heck even in my time there were fun servers up with stuff to do. Now there's what, one or two (two if you're lucky) servers with over 20 people? It's hilarious. If you're playing it today and you're keeping your projects private/not releasing them, you're doing just as much as the people complaining about the game dying. Sorry to be blunt but that's the harsh truth.The ForumsThis is just going to be a small touch to this but, never join the forums. The forums are one of the worst places on the internet, never get involved with the people there.It's not a joke how bad the forums are.People are serious with how bad they are. Don't join to find out, just don't even go to the website. Stay as far away from it as possible. It is the epitome of a♥♥♥♥♥♥community.To conclude, I think the community does not play good service for the game, and I can tell you first hand that a good majority of the people in game are less than pleasant. Now that doesn't mean everyone is bad, there are some people that are actually worth talking to, but it's a minority.Edit 3/13/17: I split my problems between myself and the game itself, follow what you wish.

												If you enjoy playing with lego's, this is certainly a game for youBlockland is an non-linear lego-esque sandbox game with no goals or objectives. Instead, you start in an empty world with only your imagination. Players use bricks to construct anything they desire. Houses, castles, spaceships, anything you can think of. The only real limit is the brickcount, which i believe is around 1,000,000 bricks at once. Unless you're some hardcore extreme builder, you'll never hit this limit and you'll be free to build anything you want without worrying about running out of bricks(a common problem found with real life legos).If you don't like building alone, it's very easy to set up a server and have friends join the fun. You could even enter a public freebuild server and hangout there.Building not you're style? That's alright, this game has multiple gamemodes aka multiple ways of playing the game. Challenge some friends to a kart race, or join a deathmatch server and show off your mad MLG no-scoping skills. Team up with other players to defeat a powerful boss. Escape from prison while avoiding police brutality. Enter a city rp, empires rp, slave rp,or, everyone's favorite roleplay, the family rp. If none of that sounds interesting, you could always try to make your own gamemode and contribute to the community.Speaking of communtity content, the blockland forums is filled with countless amounts of add ons and new content to spice up your game. Download some new weapons, get a new car, fly a stunt plane. If you're a builder, there's tons of custom bricks and tools to make building easier and more fun.A lot of reviews here seem to warn you about the game's community to some extent. I'll be honest, there are some pretty bad people in the game, particlularly on the forums. However there are lots of cool people aswell to meet in game and on the forums, and that's not so bad.THE VERDICT:I spent $20 on this game before it's steam release, and probably have 500 hours on that version. Now it's only $10, so it's even more worth it. And when it goes on sale, you should have no reason not to buy this wonderful game.So, why are you reading this review and not buying/playing this game? Get it now, you won't regret it.			"

												This is marked as a negative for only a few reasons of that of which I'm going to explain. First off, I saw this game around its older and more golden years. I saw the mods, the weapons, the missions, the GUI features and the many things that the community were throwing in and everyone was loving it! I wanted Blockland. Badly. Unfortunately, I could not get it until its Steam release. But only now as I buy this, I find out that RTB is closing down and maps have been removed. This was a huge disappointment to me and those who wanted to play alone at their free will and explore and do missions that people would create. Now, don't get me wrong. This game is awesome and a ton of fun. But its strongest hole is the bad timing of things I wanted to try like everyone else around its golden age. Steam, I can only pray and hope that you will return a better community that are worthy to make the perfect addons. Again, this is much like the same issue Garry's mod had. When I saw Gmod, it looked amazing and fantastic. I played Gmod 12 and loved it all. That was when at the very cut second Gmod 13 was released and I lost that feature. Blockland....Please don't fail like Gmod did. Just do what everyone else wants. Addons and maps again. That is all I want. Other then that, this game is worth getting if you love to have a lot of freedom. But if you are one who has seen Blockland in its older ages before the steam release, you are likely better off waiting but if you want, its likely worth it to buy this anyways for the simple fact of its fun little multiplayer servers.

												Preface: I've had this game since 2010 back in v16 and it has changed a LOT since then.  I've watched the community grow and change and I've probably spent several hundred hours on the game before it came to Steam.Blockland is a creative sandbox game created in 2004 by Badspot.  A lot of people say it's kind of like Lego Garry's Mod, which isn't far from the truth.  I love this game to pieces and always have, but it does have certain flaws that can seriously hinder the experience at times.The game is great because you can do nearly anything, but the community is a bit... strange, at times.  There are two groups of people in the game: the noobs that don't know how anything works, and the old-timers that are either very supportive of newcomers or are spiteful towards them.  There's not much middle ground between these groups and quite a lot of the veteran players have left the game since v21 was released, a few months before the game came to Steam.The biggest actual gameplay drawbacks will be very obvious within the first couple hours of playing: a bad physics engine and subpar graphics.  The physics engine has been buggy and unpredictable since the game's creation, although the graphics are actually substantially better now than before.Possibly the only thing that has really kept me playing the game this long is the giant amount of user-made content that can be found on the official forums.  The custom add-ons really bring the game to life and it's somewhat bland without them.  Nearly every popular server runs many add-ons, allowing for an even more custom and unique experience.Due to its Garry's Mod-like sandbox nature, Blockland has also inspired several notable video makers on YouTube, including Teneksi, Filipe1020, 8bitcube, Flubbman97, SirHerg1, and others.I'm trying not to be too wordy, so I'll just do pros and cons now cuz I'm boring like that.Pros:- Great building system allowing for near-endless creativity- Lots of great public servers to join- Huge catalog of mods and add-ons- Not difficult to set up a server (can be tricky sometimes if your internet is weird)- Community has lots of nice people that will help new players learn the game- Low priceCons:- Buggy physics- Average graphics- Controls can take a while to get used to- Not frequently updated (back in the day there was usually an update every couple weeks or so, but there hasn't been anything major since January 2014 as of this review)- Community has lots of trollsThe community is both a pro and a con because depending on who you meet, it could really go either way.Overall, I would say the game is definitely one of my favorite games of all time and even if you don't like it, it's only $10 USD spent.  That's really all there is to say about the game, and I hope you try it out!			"

												First impressions after around 1 hour of gameplay:- The sound effects are awful. Either too low, or so loud that it gets completely distorted.- There is no music.- Most of the time, the game is silent. When it is not silent, there is some explosion or some loud sound.- The graphics don't look good. Specifically, the lighting effects and the particles look awful.- Building blocks is not as fun because it requires both clicking and using the keyboard numpad. Minecraft got it right, putting blocks in Minecraft is fun and intuitive. Putting blocks in Blockland is not.- The physics engine is weird and bad. I started up a new single-player kart racing game, drove for a few seconds, and accidentally hit a wall. The next second I was flying across the map.- Multiplayer kart racing is not fun. At one moment I'm driving, at the next moment I'm flying across the map because someone hit me.- Due to poor car handling, I have not managed to finish any kart racing. Neither in single-player, nor in multiplayer.- I don't know if it is triple-buffering or something else, but I feel there is some input lag in the game.- It has an achievement called ""Gay Pirate"". I guess the author thought it would have been funny, but it is not. In fact, it is completely out-of-place, and some people might view it as offensive.After 1 hour of gameplay, I'm wondering why I bought this game. Well, it was because it cost me 2 dollars. But now I wonder if I will ever play it again.Then I come back to Steam Community and look at the developer response to some reviews. I'm really starting to regret buying this game.Note: Using keyboard to place blocks can be very handy sometimes. However, requiring it all the time is not practical, as it means I need to move my hand away from WASD or from the mouse. Not fun.Note 2: At least the game has a borderless mode (besides the windowed mode and fullscreen mode).Note 3: The entire game has less than 100MB when installed.Bottom line: I had more fun exploring worlds of Second Life, playing the single-player survival mode of Minecraft, and building levels in Cube Engine and Sauerbraten.

												I've had this game for many years even before it was on Steam, and I am overjoyed that it is now here. This game is worth it, and will be a long time before you get bored as long as you are imaginative and have friends to play with. Infact, I met most of my steam friends because of this game. The game has an ""environment"" system in which the textures for the skybox (skybox textures also will load their own lighting settings) and ground can be changed, a day and night cycle can be applied, water or lava can be added with customizability to the water level, as well as changes to the view distance and fog distance are possible. There are also a lot of Add-Ons for this game, which have impressive stability (Add-Ons are Found on These Forums: https://forum.blockland.us/index.php.) You can literally have 150 or more different Add-Ons made by different people, even some for older versions of Blockland, and they will continue to work with basically no problems at all. Try saying that for GMod where I can manage to have the game crash with less than 50 add-ons together.This game is certainly worth it however my only gripe with it is the lack of Linux support but even that is barely needed since it quite literally runs flawlessly on Linux using Wine versions 1.7 and up without a hickup ever.

												Were do I start.This game, in my opinion doesn't deserve a yes or a no. It's straight smack danm in the middle.It seems like parts of the game battle each other. The concept, artstyle, and basic building aspect fight the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ comminuty, forums, and the devs... Let's start with the happy stuff.Brick building! so much you can build. That part is fun. You could make a arena and fight in it, build yourself a house, and then a nebirhood, and then a city. Roleplay in it, fight in it. Add addons to make this even better. Build an airport, a military base, a cottage. Anything. Then, event it. Script it to make an awesome game of pong, working annoucements, working bombs, automated guns, automated bots, and entire games made out of some bricks and events.The eventing and building was fun. It was a great idea.And for the final good thing, There are still decent servers. Only a few, but some.Now for the negatives... now, you are about to see my atttuide about this game deeply change for this part.The comminuty. Is a apitmal ♥♥♥♥♥. It's like every 6 year old from elementary school, who says ""U mad bro"" and teases, and bullys, It's the biggest cluster♥♥♥♥. The forums are♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't go on them. There is an entire section of the forums to writing negative threads about people, there servers, or your friends on BL. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare. There's only 1 out of 4 people who are decent human beings playing a video game. Oh, and notice there's no age limit when you click on this in the store? There should be. The amount of sexual, and the heaping amount of swears on this game are unbelivable even for a vulgar person who does it a lot. It's way over the borderline for that type of person. Sure, there's a censoring system. Yeah, but it's like roblox and it can be bypassed by a 3 year old. ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; Will be taken out. ""Sh!t"", ""Sh*t"", and a lot more will not. A female or male's parts? Nope. ""Jackass""? Nope. Yep. The comminuty is so bad I HAD TO write that much.Oh, and the latest update, V.22 Removed terrain and all that nice stuff, and in turn added some shaders or something boring like that. The devs, are completly still around, but only on the forums and for accasonial bug fixes, (But that doesn't mean a million explotive bugs are still around forever) Have never updated the game in a while.And, the final con.*Dramatic Drumroll*Blockland 2. Is a thing.Meaning this same cluster♥♥♥♥, will repeat. Same brick building, same comminuty. It's going to happen. The maps and terrain will return, woohoo, but, probally:3 4th of your addons? Not compatible.Some of your amazing brick saves? Not transfering over.Even though you own the first game? Go give the dev some more money.And one new feature, and probally the only one beside better GUI'S maybe? Physics... You're building a house and it tumbles over because some jackass pushed it.Just wonderful..Overview: I can and can't reccomend this, it just depends on you're view. This game is heaven and hell mixed in to.*Just ignore that it says yes reccomended* "

The gameplay is really good, you can make a server with or without a password, if you wanna play with your friends only, I would reccomend using a password, but if you wanna make a public server then I wouldn't use a password. Another thing I like is the amount of bricks and objects you get, you get quite alot, more if you use the custom gamemode. (even more with plugins) Another thing I like is the avatar maker, you can randomize it or make your own guy, there's a great selection of hats, stuff on your T-shirt and etc. So overall I'd rate this game 10/10			"

												Blockland:+Graphics+The graphics are simple, and have lego-like textures for the studs. the lighting and particle effects are creative, and can change with hex values, so thats a space saver. The shaders, however, made the game less enjoyable, as the game shoves em down yer mouth. not alot of computers can run them.Graphics Overall: 7/10+Sound+Like the graphics, the sounds are quite simple. and using add-ons, they can be expanded and you can even create soundscapes (atmosphere sounds) with some add-ons. there are no Cons about the sounds, other then they are a little compressed.Sound Overall: 9/10+Community+As this game is about playing with your friends, it needs a good community. But, the owner just made the community go downhill after v2.0, he removed some maps that people loved (but they returned.... in 'brick' form.), he removed RTB support and the forum admins just spaz out if anyone even mentions this following sentance: ""i hate this game."" The sentance is simple, and its their opinion.Community Overall: 3/10+Overview+The game is good, but the support for the game just went downhill after V2.0There isn't much to talk about the game, its a building game, its about the community, but the game just doesn't have its old feeling.Other then that, i would recommend the game to a person who likes LEGOs and building, etc, but doesn't have a good computer to run Minecraft smoothly (since thats the game everyone talks about / never shuts up about, i really hate the minecraft fanboys, and they claim games that came out before that rubbish game all copy minecraft. e.g. Blockland, ROBLOX, etc.-+- Overall Score: 7/10 -+-			"

Lots of building that can be done, many activities that can be done, and a lot more that can be done! This game sums it all up, and it's good. I approve.			"

												A very fun game, with a small but great community. The gameplay is really good, you can make a server with or without a password, if you wanna play with your friends only, I would reccomend using a password, but if you wanna make a public server then I wouldn't use a password. Another thing I like is the amount of bricks and objects you get, you get quite alot, more if you use the custom gamemode. (even more with plugins) Another thing I like is the avatar maker, you can randomize it or make your own guy, there's a great selection of hats, stuff on your T-shirt and etc. So overall I'd rate this game 10/10			"

												Blockland:+Graphics+The graphics are simple, and have lego-like textures for the studs. the lighting and particle effects are creative, and can change with hex values, so thats a space saver. The shaders, however, made the game less enjoyable, as the game shoves em down yer mouth. not alot of computers can run them.Graphics Overall: 7/10+Sound+Like the graphics, the sounds are quite simple. and using add-ons, they can be expanded and you can even create soundscapes (atmosphere sounds) with some add-ons. there are no Cons about the sounds, other then they are a little compressed.Sound Overall: 9/10+Community+As this game is about playing with your friends, it needs a good community. But, the owner just made the community go downhill after v2.0, he removed some maps that people loved (but they returned.... in 'brick' form.), he removed RTB support and the forum admins just spaz out if anyone even mentions this following sentance: ""i hate this game."" The sentance is simple, and its their opinion.Community Overall: 3/10+Overview+The game is good, but the support for the game just went downhill after V2.0There isn't much to talk about the game, its a building game, its about the community, but the game just doesn't have its old feeling.Other then that, i would recommend the game to a person who likes LEGOs and building, etc, but doesn't have a good computer to run Minecraft smoothly (since thats the game everyone talks about / never shuts up about, i really hate the minecraft fanboys, and they claim games that came out before that rubbish game all copy minecraft. e.g. Blockland, ROBLOX, etc.-+- Overall Score: 7/10 -+-			"

												I have been playing this game since version 8--when there were only about 3000 players. I've loved this game and it's been basically the backbone of my internet career. You can literally do anything you want here--there are City RPGs, Freebuilds, Deathmatches, Mini Empires...all sorts of things. This is the LEGO game there never was. A multitude of mods make the game have the capability to host many different types of game modes that only need your brain to think up something good--there are even servers out there that you play on these floating platforms in the sky with only a grappling hook and a knife. The game used to have all sorts of terrain and buildings that you could play in, but with v28 those have been (sadly) removed. They were replaced with shaders which can really make the game look pretty, but if your computer can't handle them (most can handle them on medium at least), it's kind of a moot point. If you like playing building games with friends and want to get your creative juices flowing, get this game.			"

												Blockland was devloped by eric hartmen aka badspot.it was released as blockland 0002 in 2004, after a few years of devlopment it had a retail release in 2007.I bought this (or my dad bought it) for 20.00$ in 2012 and ended up playing this for 4 years. To me, this Blockland is kind-of underrated, I mean you don't see much videos on it. (even tho there is semi a lot of videos on it.) anyway The thing I like about blockland is that it was tons (and I mean TONS) of addons to download from the forums. (http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?board=34.0) Another thing is that there is ton of servers like boss battles, prison escape and many more. Now onething to note is that there used to be maps on blockland until v21 (the verson I joined Bl in) they replaced maps with shaders. as bad the shaders are. I am sick and tired of people ♥♥♥♥ing whining about how they ""miss"" the maps, like oh my god get over it. Anyway (again) I am not going to bore you about my ""blockland story"". Blockland's community ugh, NOW don't get me wrong there is some good people in said community, but holy crap, this is one of the worst commuity's you will ever see, I have got into so many agruements with people to the point where I hate the community now. and it's even worse in the on drama section in the forum.you'll see the cliche as ♥♥♥♥ ""I am sorry"",""is blockland dying?"" posts or a post about badmins and how bad a server is.and this is some quotes from badspot himself: ""This is not a spam board."", ""Bad things happening to you is not drama""and finally ""If you don't care, don't post"" and guess what?! People don't even read this. Ugh. Well thanks for reading my review. My rating on blockland is 10/10. Been playing it for 4 years, even if the community is garbage, I still love the game. Excuse my grammar isusses. Wait a ♥♥♥♥ing second? I barly reviewed the game, I just talk the about the game community for the most part. Well one community isn't one of the worst, it's still really bad. There is a lot of actually decent players in community like pecon7,visolator,sugar,kong123, myself,amir,badspot (Wait he is the creator) and many more and another thing great about said game is the eventing system. It's like the eventing system from rpg maker but defferent. Before v9 events were a add-on until in said verison (v9) it became hard-coded into. Players can things event via the Wrench (pre-install in the game). I am not going to say how events work in this review, but I will just say events have been used in great projects in blockland and there is many event addons and tutorials on how to event in BL and last thing to note on events, you can event bots. Lastly, building. Building in BL is pretty simple, there is a menu were you select bricks, spawns, bot spawns and many more. like with events, there is many tutorial on online on how to build stuff. Thats....my.....review. Now it ends here.			"

												highly recommend it. playing on your own on a server with strangers is alright but playing with friends is really where it's at. whether it's on a random server or your own private server you can do a lot. i'd also recommend getting plenty of add-ons and mods because the game is sort of bland without them. it gives you nice stuff to start with, but it gets old quickly. with add-ons the possibilities are pretty much endless, which makes it worth coming back to.often times the servers can be repetitive (roleplays, tdms, etc.) but every now and then you'll find a hidden gem that hasn't been seen before and can offer hours of fun. unless you want to wait around for those 'hidden gems', your best bet would be making your own server if you want a new experience.overall i think this game deserves more attention than it gets. some people just look at the bad servers and immediately dismiss it but you just need to find that one thing that gets you the most enjoyment out of the game. you just gotta look hard enough			"

												highly recommend it. playing on your own on a server with strangers is alright but playing with friends is really where it's at. whether it's on a random server or your own private server you can do a lot. i'd also recommend getting plenty of add-ons and mods because the game is sort of bland without them. it gives you nice stuff to start with, but it gets old quickly. with add-ons the possibilities are pretty much endless, which makes it worth coming back to.often times the servers can be repetitive (roleplays, tdms, etc.) but every now and then you'll find a hidden gem that hasn't been seen before and can offer hours of fun. unless you want to wait around for those 'hidden gems', your best bet would be making your own server if you want a new experience.overall i think this game deserves more attention than it gets. some people just look at the bad servers and immediately dismiss it but you just need to find that one thing that gets you the most enjoyment out of the game. you just gotta look hard enough			"

Some servers will be similar to FNAF some server will restrict FNAF stuff, it really just depends on the player and/or server. Have fun if you get it!			"

I also don't like how there's brick physics. I don't like it because I've played a game like this (NOT ROBLOX) and it didn't have physics.

												Blockland is awesome, It's a legendary building game where you build anything you want. The best of this game is shaders. The shaders are amazing. Textures, qualites, physics and more. Building can be hard at first, but. Once you get ust to it, you might build good builds in the future. Blockland is mainly about building. Building anything you want, from a house to a school! And there are many ways to build, some are fast but less efficent, some are slow but very efficent. Another important thing is combat. You can battle your friends or Bots in your map or in another server. Another thing is Socializing, most servers have E-Tard List filters, that prevent people from saying U or anything else. And chat spam protection, where if you talk too much, Blockland will block you only for a few matter of time. There is also a trust feature, where you can send Trust Invites to build on your friends or other people's builds. You can also make objects in your home, interact with them and more. Making them more detailed and beautiful. Blockland also haves mini-games, where you can use those to create short or long mini-games to battle your friends in your sandbox server.			"

												Jesus has this been around for a long time...Blockland one the first games i've played on my first computer. It is a 3rd/1st person Block game with many different custom game modes to choose from and a very LARGE amount of customization that you can do to your character. This is one of the few games that when i heard went onto steam I HAD TO BUY.Pros:Billions of customization choicesVery large amounts of Custom gamemodesVery nice communityNo voice chat (Thank god)Saveable CostumesChoose your own nameFamily-FriendlyCons:The community is full of very small childrenThey removed the very old maps (Snow Mountains, Bedroom, and Mountains)There is no demo version on steamNo family-share (;-;)While I don't play it now as much as i use to. I really enjoy the game and i randomly play it from time to time. I really recommend this game for anyone who wants to have nostalga or just wants to play some custom gamemodes.			"

												Create, Construct, Everything. Welcome to the most unknown place thats called... ""Baseplate"". In this you can create your own buildings, and alot more. There is many ways that you can go on every server, Such as Pecon7 and Chrisbot6.. and etc. Whatever you decide to build your own structure your imagining that your gonna build something that you've ever imagine. Every Dedicated server that you can go that you can meet your new friend. If your a new person you might as well be nice to each other to help them what are they gonna build if they said ""yes"" you might as well help them, You can look at the gallery for going to the official blockland forums. What can I say to this game, ""For your own imagination it is your dream to build anything out of blocks, landscape, terrain, skyscraper, citys, town, house, and alot more."" This game is 9.5/10.

												Blockland is a really good game. Badspot made something awesome here. I can start the game up and go on a server and have fun instantly. No matter the gamemode. Racing in carts is fun. Mining for hours just to get a good pickaxe is fun. Sniping other players is fun. The entire game is fun, heck, building pixel art of Mario and putting the fire emitters on it is cool to see. The whole concept of the game is really awesome. It's easy to mod, it's easy to have fun, and it's not expensive. I got the game for $2.49 while it was on sale and I wish I would have bought it for it's full price. Building in an online enviroment has never given me as much freedom as this game does. Think building with LEGO's online.The community here is outstanding. They practically make the game. There's tons of mods, tons of minigames, an acceptable amount of servers with nice, friendly people. Well, usually the people are friendly. There are some badmins out there and just plain rude people out there but it's the internet so thats not very surprising.The game isn't updated much anymore though, but oh well. What we have here is a cool little game you can have hours of fun on. Although it isn't as popular as it was before, Blockland stands out to me as one the funniest times I've had playing a game with friends and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves building stuff and letting their imagination flow.

												Great game, I loved playing it back in the day with maps and the great service known as RTB. However is recent years Badspot decided to remove the maps in exchange for enhance graphics and shaders. Despite the fact that I loved map, especially bedroom, it was a welcome change for me as I could now build on an unlimited scale. And, I've noticed some people say that there is stuff like a vehicle, bot, and a brick limit. Now this is mostly seen on the demo version of the game and these limits in the full version can be changed in the server settings before you start your server. Anyways, probably one of the best sandbox games I've ever seen, and I would love to see its community grow greatly. Who knows, maybe in years to come we might get RTB and maps added back into the game. Keep building and have fun!			"

												well how do I explain this gamewell, this game building block game that isn't roblox where the community is basicly one big bar room fight with moderate off topic discussion and various ""hey guys check out what I made"" chats, while a man who had sex with a dog bashes another man over the head with a barstool before the giant armored bouncer grabs him by the nipples and throws him out the window where he lands on the pile of the other 40 men previously thrown out the window, the man then uses his survival to pay the entry fee to come back into the bar after waiting in line with 15 other guys doing the same thing while meanwhile inside the bar a middle aged man starts slapping people with a worm at the end of a hook from the top of a table and people refuse to move to a seat further away, but it doesn't matter because he keeps hopping from table to table anyways			"

												This is a very interesting and innovative game. You could almost compare it to Lego, as it has a building aspect. In this game there are various different gamemodes to try out, such as racing. While these gamemodes can be played in singleplayer, I would reccomend you hop on a server with your friends to play them as they are meant for multiplayer, and are more fun when played in multiplayer. 7/10			"

Some servers will be similar to FNAF some server will restrict FNAF stuff, it really just depends on the player and/or server. Have fun if you get it!			"

 The Hard Truth Listen up ladies and gents, here is the story. Blockland was a wonderful prosperous game. Great community and servers. The game was in its prime with maps and players everyone helping others build massive cities and gamemodes for all around to enjoy. Then v21 came out and took out these wonderful maps. Lots of players stopped joining these great servers and leaving the game altogether. There was still a lot of players left to build up from the rubble of this update. After a while the community slowly died. Then it hit, RTB shut down. This was the soul of the game, it held all the players' ideas and creations. Thus with this community website shutting down, it killed this game. Servers are barren, players are dazed and confused, creations dwindled. The game hit its peak then dropped harder than it should have. It's still a wonderful game it's just there are about a max population of 300 players on a day with about 90 or so servers up. About 30% of servers will have 0-2 players just sitting there, doing nothing.Story brought to you by loads of hours of offline steam play before it hit the greenlight. Still recommending this because it's still fun with a group of friends.			"

												All I can say is if you enjoyed legos when you were younger you'll love this. Whether you are dicking around building, having a deathmatch or racing in speed kart, the game is just pure fun. Some like to compare it to games such as Minecraft which I think is just silly, while the two may look similar they are nothing alike. The amount of user made content for this game is large enough to keep you occupied for quite a while and theres always something new to check out. My only complaints so far is the physics when it comes to speed kart, but even the wackyness of it can lead to some interesting races. I've also had the game crash on me quite a number of times and had errors logging into the servers to authenticate my game key (which I was lead to believe was Steams fault) Overall I give it a solid 7/10.

												This game is a pretty good game, a lot of the gamemodes are fun, and building is always cool also, but the two things that I can think as a negative for this game is that the community is not really that great. The owner can't even manage to update the game after 4 years, in fact he doesnt actually gives to ♥♥♥♥♥ about the game anymore. Two, the game is almost dying it needs a little more people to play it. There are only two servers that are full of people and then everything else is like 7-1 players and abandoned servers.I rate this game a 9/10 since I played this game ever since I was 9 years of age, and from that passage of time the game still holds up pretty well.

												This is a great game, this was my first pc game i ever had and i played this for atleast a year straight. The only thing they should add is a workshop, especially since Return To Blockland is down. If you like garry's mod and Legos, this would probably be the game for you. (Your lucky, the full, original price was $20; before the steam upload)			"

												Amazing game. Physics are Hilarious. 10/10Its very fun, enjoyable, gets you out of the bored with all the minigames and gamemodes Blockland brings you. Build stuff. Destroy stuff. Blow up stuff. The bricks rebuild themselves anyways.So in my perspective, Fun game, Great Community, Fun things to do, Great.			"

												=HEADS UP=I had a review before this one about the game being bad. This stays and is an Answer towards a user that truly loves this game and couldnt understand why i would downvote the game because my reasons were absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in his opinion.=INFO ABOUT THE REVIEW=1. My reviews tend to be a bit longer. If that is the case please be patient and read everything.2. This review is about my point of view and opinion. [If you disagree on a certain point or want to correct me: Be reasonable or i will ignore your comment.]3. If you want to try to change my opinion with arguments that make no sense in any way then please do not comment at all.=REVIEW=I will begin my review how i began it last time: Blockland, a game that looks nice and enjoyable.I have not played it for long since it didnt give me the chance. The reason for that will be displayed in detail below and just another heads up: If you dont like them deal with it and give my downvote a downvote. Or be reasonable and discuss it with me in a reasonable fashion.1. I saw this game and thought how amazing it would be to play it. I had it on my wishlist but other games took more of my time at that point so i didnt think of buying it. After a while a friend of mine by the name of DarquePanda bought it for me as a present. I was so happy and right away installed it. After it was downloaded i hoped into the tutorial and well it wasnt the best.2. The things i got in the tutorials were the basics of the game. The VERY basics. Building was explained shortly and mainly how you move the blocks. I mean it does explain you how to do certain things but if you dont want to play Twister on your keyboard with both hands on a mouse+keyboard game... But i didnt care much about that at this point in time since i wanted to play. So i tried to hop onto a server.3. I have waited a short amount of time and the game didnt response anymore. Nothing worked anymore. Not even Alt+F4 what made me cut off the power to my PC. After restarting PC and Game i tried making my own server since i just wanted to build something. And i pop up in a prebuilt world where i literaly could do nothing. I couldnt even look around. But this time Alt+F4 worked. And this made me uninstall the game again.The next part of the review is about something that happened to me after a while with a user and what i will also mention to clarify some of my points.After reading in a few reviews about how bad the community of this game is i most certainly can understand what they mean. After a long time with no problems with my review a user turned up and talked to me about one of my points in my downvote. I understood what he meant but still mentioned that doesnt interest me in terms of my  review since when a game doesnt work, it doesnt work.But instead of leaving it be he tried to make me look like an idiot and my arguments like♥♥♥♥♥♥ My first argument was the loading time, mentioned above as well, what he said is normal and i should be patient since he himself, with worse internet than mine as i read, had to wait a good amount of time just as well. I have played without mods. And my game bugged out so much that i had to restart my PC. That says everything doesnt it?To the next point of the controlls he said that you can rebind the controlls. A valid point if it wasnt for the fact that the game was made for MOUSE and KEYBOARD! And if you include the mouse into gameplay and you use wasd for the controlls you do not expect the user moving the hand off the mouse to use the other keys. The controlls for a game like this should be configured so you can use them without playing Twister on your Keyboard and that with both hands but they arent.There is a different game out there that is called Lego Worlds what is sort of similar to Blockland from what i saw except modding so far. And what can i say? From what i saw it is much better than Blockland can ever be. It not only looks better but also works much easier when looking at gameplay and hearing reviews about how the game and gameplay works in terms of controlls.I also want to mention the brilliant idea the good man that i am writing this review for. This might look to some a little bit to much but since this is a review about the game and people already mentioned the community i will also give an example of it. He had the brilliant idea of saying that before i could even write a review about this game i should atleast play it for 50 hours. Without that i should take down my review since it wouldnt be valid.And that has been it. I dont like the game. I dont want to play the game. I have already wasted time and space on my PC for it once and i refuse to do it again. And the worst is that i cant even refund this game even though i bought it BEFORE the refund update.			"

												Dont buy this game if your 15 and below! This isnt rated for children. I made the same mistake. Lots of people swear and curse and if you do get this game and your below 15 dont go on role - plays.Its basicly dating and some freaks .Theyre out for $ec.So thats down to the first part of my info secondly. Blockland is a fun do what you want sand box.You can build your own house a car live the dream with some lemonade ;) ! But beware! If you make a house on anothers server you may never get it back. It happened to me and my friend.Third of all theirs adventure of course.My favorite adventure servers is KONGS deathrace,The black parrots falling platforms,and dogfights.Kongs server is ,cars racing to the endyou have a temate or none and you try to kill your oponet or try to win by driving to the house in both maps.The black parrots falling platforms is ,jumping around colors and rockets shot at you but you cant be color blind and you have to read to know wich color to stand on.Then dogfights :) you drive planes and helicopters KILL eachother and capture bases ! :DSo i do think blockland is an amazing game but please do not buy this if your realy  young .BUT  if you need help just go to badspot they run it all. I THINK! But warning dont save others stuff oly on your server			"

												All I can say is if you enjoyed legos when you were younger you'll love this. Whether you are dicking around building, having a deathmatch or racing in speed kart, the game is just pure fun. Some like to compare it to games such as Minecraft which I think is just silly, while the two may look similar they are nothing alike. The amount of user made content for this game is large enough to keep you occupied for quite a while and theres always something new to check out. My only complaints so far is the physics when it comes to speed kart, but even the wackyness of it can lead to some interesting races. I've also had the game crash on me quite a number of times and had errors logging into the servers to authenticate my game key (which I was lead to believe was Steams fault) Overall I give it a solid 7/10.

												This review personally makes me said, I was a longtime blockland player my id was in the 8000's it was small and simple but had a vast comunnity to play in. It ran well and♥♥♥♥♥♥I always prefered it over minecraft, then when I was like 15 I saw this game on steam, it had problems but overall ran like the game, for one RTB didn't work on it which sucked considering the huge mod selection, players got a completely broken game unable even to open it. Then it died. What else to say lol It was super ♥♥♥♥ing fun back then, but with the lack of a community it's no fun.			"

												I like it. I used to do modding for the game (primarily additional bricks) but the lack of general interest in the game so did my desire in modding. In it's core it's a good game, but it's a game which stands on it's community to create the environment. Which is awesome, but smaller the community, the harder it is to get new people to play the game, which is unfortunate and I can't phantom there being any better times upcoming for the game.			"

												If you like minecraft but wish for a bit more freedom for your creativity, this might be it.Its almost litterally LEGO on your pc, but with some basic options that allow amazing things.Fighter jets, replica of PONG, musical stairs, pirate battles you name it.And just click a block with the wrench tool and have it do something amazing when touched/looked at/used etc.Multiplayer serves are where the fun really gets going though, and there are some amazing custom gamemodes that work right out of the box, no mods needed.You wont shake the feeling you are playing legos+ in a hurry though, so if thats not your cup of tea then this isnt for you.

												I must say this game is rather dissapointing. After they shut down RTB getting mods/addons has been much more difficult and without the mod/addons the game is horribly limitied and dull. Once you get the addons the game lightens up with more fun however with to many servers that have 1-2 people multiplayer can be meh at best.

												Wow. Just wow. Coming from years of playing minecraft, I look back on my time spent and realize ""What was I doing?"" I could have been playing a vastly superior game. Now that I think about it, I should not call this a game. It's more of a work of art. Eric ""Badspot"" Hartman, the modern day Pablo Picasso and creator of this masterpiece obviously knows how to create new, fresh, original content, and not take the ideas of others and put them into a subpar game, in a genre controlled by a single giant game. Minecraft, on the other hand, attempts to rip off a game such as this, to a lesser quality. Does minecraft have a destruction engine? Nope, but this mona lisa of games does. Does minecraft have a working multiplayer? Hardly, but the sistine chapel of sandbox building games, Blockland, sure does. The only thing I can say in conclusion is that to all minecraft players looking for a better experience, look no further then Blockland.			"

The users tend to fill in for Badspot, the creator, by making addons and gamemodes and the like for everyone, usually on the official forums (Google is your friend.) You'll have lots of fun with it when you finish learning how to play, I guarantee it.So, yeah. Play it.			"

												This game is one of the best lego building games I have ever played. The game implements such great and innovative ideas that I can never go back to roblox or minecraft. There are no griefers online because of the games ""trust"" system. People can't build on your bricks unless you grant them trust (which you can give them through the player list GUI). There are two types of trust: the first type is build trust were people are allowed to build on your bricks, the second type is full trust were people are allowed to modify and delete your bricks. You can also demote someone's trust or take it away from them entirely so they can't build on your stuff.The administrative options are great as well. If someone spammed bricks all over your server you don't have to manually clean them up. Instead the admin GUI allows you to clear all the bricks of a specific user. You can also choose to spy on a person through the GUI to see if they are misbehaving. You can also load a save that you built before if you are an admin so you dont have to always build everything up on a server. There are also two different types of admins: admin and super admin. An ordinary admin can ban, admin orb (fly around and go through bricks) and load bricks. A super admin can do all that but it can also deadmin ordinary admins and ban them, they can also change what mods and gamemode is on the server as well.Another great thing is the event system. This allows you to create simple function with your bricks. So if you want to can have so when you click on a certain brick it disappears, or have a building explode when you step over a brick. The game also has bots that you can also event. This allows you to change their appearance, their weapon, if they are an ally or enemy, and much more. You can also apply lights to bricks and emitters which add smoke, grass, and different effects. This adds much more life to your builds and instead of just making a build for people to look at on a free build. You can create an adventure were people have to battle bots or have to collect keys to open doors.The minigame system is also amazing. With this system people can create their own game within the game. This allows them to select a playertype, select what weapons to start out with, etc. then invite people to join it. So people can be DMing on a free build of they want but this won't affect the people who didn't join the minigame. So you can have people fighting in a deathmatch, people racing, and people happily building all on the same server (the minigame system can be disabled if you want).The game also very moddible which keeps the game fresh. Installing a mod is very easy. Just put the zip into the adding folder, enable it in the custom game mode option and your done. There is also a mod called ""return to blockland"" which allows you to download mods ingame. The mods can be adding more vehicles, more events, different skyboxes, different bricks, basically anything. There is also a type of mod called a gamemode which packages a bunch of different addons into one and loads save and different gamemode options.The only real flaw of the game is that there aren't a big variety of servers up due to the community being so small. But the great thing is that you can create just about anything and it allows you to set up your own server without port forwarding so you can just create any type of server you want.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes building and Legos. Even to people who don't because there is such a large variety of things to do. This is the best building game I have played and puts other building games to shame.			"

												I bought this game back in 2014. And all I can say is that this game is hard to be respected in, the players in this game will ♥♥♥♥ with you no matter what, the best way to be respected or at least liked, is make a good server, dont be a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Amd never sign up to the forums. It's true this game is pretty much dead, but we still break 700 players playing on it daily and keep it alive. There's recently been a breakthrough in servers in this game, such as Crown's Jailbreak. K9 Kids Gameshow. Multiple City rpgs. You most definitely will make friends in this game easily, that is if you follow the server rules and are a nice guy to other people. In honesty. I'd give this game q 7/10 for replay factor, a 5/10 in the community. And a 8/10 in modability.			"

												If you are not deeply into the building mechanics of this game stay far away from it. Its depends fully on mods and its community to be anything at all and what I encountered did no impress me at all but it might simply not be for me. Its a sandbox with a fair amount of tools but what you will most likely encounter if you go in blind will make you want to never touch the game again.It has a fairly simply list of achievements to introduce you to different parts of the game but has some really frustrating ones. One of them being for being on a server with 31 other people which is quite a rare thing and the more time that passes the harder it will become. When I got it there was only a single server close to those numbers, and I was only able to boost it high enough by asking friends with the game to join the server. But the most annoying achievement in the game goes to the race achievements. Its fairly simply as far as the idea goes; you need to complete an SP race and win a MP race on someone else's server...shouldnt be too bad if the driving mechanics was ok, but they are really bad. The driving is super floaty, and you can go of the track really easy forcing you to start all over.Time to 100%: 1-3 hours (depending on your luck)			"

												Honesty the worst $10 ive ever spent on steam. Ive spent hundreds of $$ on steam and have 90+ games, and this is by far the worst. The trailers depict what the game could be, had the developer actually update the game like hes supposed to. Updates havent come in a long time, and the best features and maps have been taken out. Its like a crappy version of Lego games. Bad graphics, laggy even when run with a powerful computer (i have an i7 4th gen 4700 processor and dual gtx 780s) and this is still laggy, which = server lag. Max of 50-60 people online total at any given time, split up in random servers so there is never enough on one to play. Too many trolls and little kids. Overall crappy game. DO NOT waste money on this. you will regret it. I uninstalled after 1 solid hour of playing just to give it a shot.			"

												GAME DEV THREATENS TO DOX HIS USERS: https://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=265533.msg7813766#msg7813766This was a decent game for a while, and I've had a lot of fun with it, but the developer has cashed out his shekels and the game is pretty much dead now. The main developer treats his fans like garbage, arbitrarily squelches and bans people who disagree with him, and has a history of sitting on his hands when gamebreaking bugs make the game literally unplayable.Most of the community has moved on, and I can't blame them. Buying this game 8 years ago would have been worth it. Buying it now is equivalent to throwing your money in the garbage. Don't waste your time or money on this game or clown of a developer.Oh, and by the way, the developer (Badspot) has been trying to manipulate his reviews for this game by buying paid reviews and trying to extinguish negative ones under threat of key revoking. Shows his true colors.			"

												When i was younger, like 11 years old, i liked this game. But this game is starting to get really silly and unpopular. It's just not really that great. I recommend it for LEGO fans but other than that, it's not really worth your money.This game gets a 4/10.			"

												This game isn't good or worth the money that it's being charged, the creator is openly mean and rude to everyone, and the people who play aren't all that nice either.If you want a good game that involves building, just get Minecraft.			"

												the game is dead to me, this game is not blockland, its a poor mans minecraft, the community has turned to acid, and soon, to dust, the aspects of the game that made it fun in the good days, are gone, buried beneith the the vast layers of garbage, i bought this game, the non- steam version, 4 yrs ago, i had innocent, honest to god fun with other people, people just like me, who loved playing the game, because the game, back then, was good, it was fun, it was something to take my mind of of problems, and stress. it was a like a security blanket when i played it, i felt safe in the community, i felt happy in the community, i just loved the community, i am proud of being part of the old community, of being part of the old blockland, the one that you would spend hours playing, not to rack up your kills on a TDM server, but because you had FUN. the game is a shell of its former self, the part of my brain holding the memories, the few distant memories of the OLD blockland, is crying, and does so every time i play it. the new blackland can burn in hellRIPYe Olde BlocklandI will miss you.

If you don't want to watch the video, this was my impression of Blockland:The load times are ridiculous. I understand that it's a game that's mostly been kept afloat by it's creator community, so you have to download their assets, but we legitimately spent anywhere between five to ten minutes on loading screens alone playing each server we jumped in on. The RP servers are weird. We joined one where everyone was a dragon. There's no real words for how bizzare it was. "

												I have been playing this game for a few years, mainly indulging in it when I was far younger. The game still has some charm, and it will definitely benefit from being on steam, considering the community was a dying breed. All in all, it is like Roblox, only less Roblox. Though, that isn't to say the game isn't full of children (it is), and that the technical difficulties can be somewhat abbundant depending on the servers (depending on server work). Expect the few servers that have a lot of players to stay just that way, while the other few million remain dusty, and deserted. Only a handful of the servers will actually have players on them (as of 12/16/13, this could change with the introduction to steam). Oh, and there is a learning curve.If you can get past some of it's few shortcomings, it is worth it, as a fun minigame host.Oh, and the creator is still active, though barely.			"

No seriously though the game by itself is quite basic and a little dull but there are thousands of addons on the internet that can be installed simply by dragging them into a folder. Plus there are so many servers with so many different games it is impossible not to find something fun to play!			"

Every server can be unique in a way, some have certain mods, while others do not.Now onto the 2 basic gamemodes; Custom: Enable any mods you want, and Freebuild: Build stuff.There are other gamemodes too, and more and more are being made by fellow Blocklanders.Time to conclude, I rate this game 9/10.It's a 9/10 because the game is basically dead, it's not being worked on by Badspot			"

												This game remains head of its class. There simply isn't another competitor. Go ahead and just try to find another good building game on steam that isn't autist minecraft sized bloxel garbage. Even LEGO's entry into this genre is *incredible* trash, and compared to their older building software, it's space-age technology. This, right here, is the only true brick building game.This game still gets patched but development is pretty much done. Disappointing, this game desperately needs better physics. Also, there's still no default helicopter. OR workshop support Other than that, you couldn't ask for a better sandbox game. This is a true 10/10. Worth every penny.			"

												The game itself is really good and fun, but the people who made the game are not enjoyable at all and the community has too many jerks in it. I have had this game since before it was a Steam game, it used to actually be better than it is now but the updates over time seem to have done more damage than good, but still the game itself is so much fun, it is the people who play and make it that are aweful. My favorite aspect is the event based programming built into the game that allows for so many possibility, that and it feels like playing with LEGOs, though if you want the good version of this game try LEGOWorlds. It is earily access so it has its downsides, but the community is not as bad (though there is no multiplayer yet) and they come out with updates that are actually good.For those commenting. If you are going to insult or argue with me I am just going to delete your comment. I do not have to justify myself to you.			"

												Where do I begin? Blockland is a blocky style sandbox game, now I know what you're thinking, ""Oh, it's just a stupid ROBLOX rip off!"" But it's anything but that. In Blockland, you can do the traditonal free build mode, or you can do pirate death matches, search for treasure chests, race, and even more! The community has made many addons for this game, so you'll never get bored in it. This game is best enjoyed online, single player mode can be fun and all, but after a while you get sick of it. Over the years the game's community keeps shrinking and sadly this game is dying, but don't let that stop you from trying this game out, it's still a wonderful game you can easily enjoy, no matter how small the community becomes.

												It's like ROBLOX with less stuff since it's technically LEGO and with a way better community.The biggest cons is the low amount of players, but I guess this is good at the same time because when a game has lots of members, it gets lots of little annoying MLG/ghetto/dank meme kiddies just like tons of popular online games.The character customization is also pretty low in stuff. I mean, few faces, few hats. But that also reduces the amount of ""judging by appearance"" thingy. No one's rich, no one's poor, we're all on the same class unless a server has a currency system.8/10 I'm kind of addicted.			"

												Pros: 5Tons of great addons such as: weapons, gamemodes, vehicles and more!Good servers now and then.Character customizationFun gamemodesHilarious bouncy physics in vehicles.Easy hosting. (For those that disagree dedication is a separate thing from hosting the server.)Cons: 4Community is often bad.Most servers are bad or empty.People tend to make click bait servers.Creator (BadSpot) has abandoned the game, thus it stopped getting updated.Overall, this a great game if you know where the proper place to look for servers and addons is. There's always a good server for me to play on, cool gamemodes to host! Large amount of addons for me to download. The vehicle physics can cause some funny moments. And there's even bots for when you wanna make single player dm's or NPC's in your Adventure gamemodes! I recommend this game to anyone who is up for a awesome mixed up gaming experience! Don't let the community get to you. If you can focus on what's in the game and not those playing the game, you'll will enjoy this game for sure!			"

Or you could buy a set of legos and have fun and keep what you build.			"

												Personaly i do not prefer this game.I find it very creative yes, and i like that in games but my big problem is that it is so basic.There is little to do asside from make Block Colour structures from bricks that offer little detail or freedom and if you want to mod it to change that fact, its a rather risky process. And after that, what are you meant to (or do) do? Because i dont have a clue what-so-ever on what to do after completing the games one sole objective... 'to build a thing and leave it there purely for decoration' so i became verry bored of it within the first few hours. 3/10 don't recomend to highly.Also for how much its charged for i think its a bit to much. £7 for a game like this... mabey if there was a bit more to it but right now, no.

												This is arguably the best game I have ever bought. There are so many different things you can do. You can build pretty much whatever you want. You can have team deathmatches themed for tons of games like TF2, CoD, and battlefield, and much much more. You can race in a realistic style race or you can set up a mariokart style race. Those are just a few examples of the versatility of this game. There are so many different things you can do in this game, it is worth much more than its low cost of 10 dollars.			"

												I hate how people argue about which game is best. Minecraft, Roblox, or Blockland. Personally, i love them all. They're all great games and if you dont like Roblox or Minecraft or Blockland, there is no need to tell everybody. Don't say stuff like ""Dont play this game! I hate it! It sucks!"" or anything like this. Just have your own opinion and dont let the rest of the world know.			"

												I'll admit it. I played ROBLOX when I got my computer back in 2010. Was ROBLOX awful? Yes. They turned a simple lego creativity game into a pay to play kind of game. Blockland, however, is not. Blockland uses all of the elements that ROBLOX has and multiplies the options by ten, with more controls, bricks, and ways to play. If you were to buy a Garry's Mod lego set, that would be Blockland. Lots of servers to choose from, many gamemodes (Even custom ones!), a community that is suprisingly adult-aged, and hours of fun. I would recommend this to anyone who loves LEGO's and Garry's Mod. It also has a weird physics engine, which adds to new exciting gameplay modes.			"

												This game is damn fun if you're in the right mood. But, it can get boring after a while, and even playing with friends gets really tiresome. Another problem with Blockland is the modding community. they have mods, sure, but not on steam. there is no workshop for this game, yet you can find online mods that you have to download and then move to the game's files.its a minor problem, but a problem none the less. I'd give it a 6 out of 10.			"

												When first opening (for macs) it asks what network type and mouse and keyboard options, when I choose the settings it says: Blockland cannot save your preferences. This can be caused by running the game from a read-only directory, mounted image or CD-ROM. Make sure you have copied the Blockand folder to your applications (which I did) and are running the game from there. Do not run the game directly from the dmg file. I've went online and sought answers from strangers on the interne, to no avail. Many people seem to have the some trouble and there doesn't seem to be a solution. Apart from that there are other bugs like not being able to see the face on the block person. Overall they seem like simple problems with quick solutions that have yet to be addressed by the developers and what not. So if you are a mac user, I would not recommend this game.			"

I bought this on sale for about 2$, and i do not regret it. The origonal price is too high to buy this game and make the most of it. I recommend you wait until it goes on sale to try it out. The best aspect of the game is definatly the multiplayer, with many different gamemodes to choose from. Over-all, i recommend it if this game is on sale for very cheap, but otherwhys i would not buy it.			"

												I ahve played this game since, well, probably since 2009. This game was going down hill then, but now it has really dropped. The server list was almost always full, filled with players, but now the servers are all empty and the best you can get is maybe a server filled with 10 people. I have 24.8 hours on my record, but overall I have played this for probably 200 hours. Most of the community stopped playing this game because maps were removed. A lot of people complained about it, but when I look back at it, maps did cause many problems. I still recomend this game if you just want to build things or if you want something to play with a few friends. I stopped playing in 2012 and came back in 2014, when this game was added to Steam, and I think it has restored the game's potential. Let's start a reboot of the community!			"

What used to make this game really cool was the custom maps but the dev decided to remove them for some reason and you just have the boring gm_flatgrass-esque maps.The building system has always been really bad too. You have to move the blocks around with your keypad controls and place them one by one and it makes the building really annoying when you compare it to Minecraft or even something like Lego's digital designer tool.Get Minecraft instead, it's a much more fun and complete game.

												One of the best online builders i've seen. Compatible with MacOSx, Win XP - 8, and Linux. An actually decent community, AND ITS EASY TO MAKE YOUR OWN CONTENT. YES! You can download addons that don't require an IKEA instruction booklet, and make your own decals (textures) in a maximum time of 1 - 2 minutes. Best played with friends, the demo is just like the full game with a few restrictions. Other than unlimited building off the bat, You unfortunatly can't use addons, (it sucks i know, but hey! It's only $10:00), You can't play online, though you can play LAN if one person bought it. And for you people who have a life, LAN = Local Area Network, or in other words. you have to be in the same building as the other person. Overall, a great game. Big thanks to everyone to Eric Hartman, Kompressor, and everyone who contributed to/greenlit this game. Have Fun!			"

												Above : I actually have more minutes/hours then that, I recently switched my key to steam,Anyways here is my review :Blockland IS a very good sandbox game, you'll be finding games similar to GMOD.It is basically legos, if you are good with those, you'll be a master builder on here.Some Cons : The game does not have alot packaged in it, that is why you need.MODS. Mods are fine by me, but you must be careful.It's good a very good community so.Overall, this is a great game, I would buy it for only 10 dollars, it use to be 20, so I would go ahead and get it.kthxbye			"

												Personaly i do not prefer this game.I find it very creative yes, and i like that in games but my big problem is that it is so basic.There is little to do asside from make Block Colour structures from bricks that offer little detail or freedom and if you want to mod it to change that fact, its a rather risky process. And after that, what are you meant to (or do) do? Because i dont have a clue what-so-ever on what to do after completing the games one sole objective... 'to build a thing and leave it there purely for decoration' so i became verry bored of it within the first few hours. 3/10 don't recomend to highly.Also for how much its charged for i think its a bit to much. £7 for a game like this... mabey if there was a bit more to it but right now, no.

The game use to be much better before the map was changed to a static plain of blocks. Only reason I have blockland on my steam is because I linked it. I have played blockland for probably 300+ hours before it even came out on steam, even before the updates. So short answer, NO I don't. Use to be great.			"

												I think it is stupid that the developer is just a greedy and rude person who just wanted to put this game on Steam so he could just make some cash. I hope he reads this and realizes that maybe he should start updating this game instead of leaving it all buggy and glitchy and without all the things from the original game on the website. But over all, I would say that this game is a pretty decent game. I just wish that the developers would do more with this game, so that people wouldn't just buy this game and then be dissapointed that they didn't get everything that they had thought they paid for.

 Blockland. A two-sided coin.  = Foreward = Okay, to start, blockland  by itself (By which I mean the game alone)  is by no means a bad game.It has it's pros and cons like any other game, but is mostly good.I will now describe this game through a  pros-cons paragraph (I know, overdone. But effective)! -=PROS=- + Building is fun, and has many possibilities. You just need creativity!+ Lots of bricks, vehicles, weapons and tools to use.+ Customizable characters (You get all hats, shirts etc., for free with the game)!+ Many, many add-ons, created by players which make the game 10 times better (They add and/or         adjust everything mentioned above).+ Has it's own ""Dumbed down"" version of scripting.+ Hosting and joining servers is very easy (Albeit, you may have to download the server's add-ons, if any) -=CONS=- - Community is absolutely cancer sometimes; stay away from the following types of servers:~Freebuild (With exceptions)~Family RP~FNAF RPI'm not kidding. A lot of the Blockland community is comprised of basement-dwelling man-babies. Stay. Away. From. These. Servers. - A bit glitchy sometimes.Overall ----  7/10 Very fun game. A NOTE TO PARENTS. If you want to buy your kid this game, go ahead, BUT.As I mentioned above, the people you may meet here do not act appropriately enough for young kids.I reccomend your son/daughter play alone, or on a private server with his/her friends.You have been warned. This community is very finnicky.  LINK TO BLOCKLAND FORUMS Be careful browsing here. Blockland Forums [forum.blockland.us] -- Find add-ons here. (Be careful about posting) "

												I'll admit it. I played ROBLOX when I got my computer back in 2010. Was ROBLOX awful? Yes. They turned a simple lego creativity game into a pay to play kind of game. Blockland, however, is not. Blockland uses all of the elements that ROBLOX has and multiplies the options by ten, with more controls, bricks, and ways to play. If you were to buy a Garry's Mod lego set, that would be Blockland. Lots of servers to choose from, many gamemodes (Even custom ones!), a community that is suprisingly adult-aged, and hours of fun. I would recommend this to anyone who loves LEGO's and Garry's Mod. It also has a weird physics engine, which adds to new exciting gameplay modes.			"

												This game is pretty bad, I used to play it when I was younger and into roblox type games. What used to make this game really cool was the custom maps but the dev decided to remove them for some reason and you just have the boring gm_flatgrass-esque maps.The building system has always been really bad too. You have to move the blocks around with your keypad controls and place them one by one and it makes the building really annoying when you compare it to Minecraft or even something like Lego's digital designer tool.Get Minecraft instead, it's a much more fun and complete game.

												Basics of the blockland experience: install the game log on Forget about changing from your default name Join a freebuild server. Get yelled at to change your name disconnect Change your name Join another  freebuild server. tell everybody that your new to the game and ask them to let you know if you do something wrong. Get banned with a reason saying ""This server is protected by ANTI-N00B, Blocklands #1 anti noob software"" Find out it wasnt software that banned you, it was a 9 year old. Join a differnt freebuild server Repeat step 7 Turns out everybody on the server is cool with noobs Get tought how to play the game by some really nice people Those people who tought you how to play the game turn out to become your life long friends Play on another server with your friends Build amazing things with your friends get your amazing things destroyed by another 9 year old admin whos jealous of your building skills You and your friends are extremely mad You and your friends team up and go on a massive trolling spree to get revenge on the 9 year old admin spam and break the rules for 3 hours get banned for a week you and the 9 year old are now enemys Play on another server The admin is a 4 year old little girl this time Your friend builds a really cool house that has scripted bots guarding it The 4 year old gets angry because she gets killed every time she walks past the house The 4 year old bans your friend You and your other friends get mad you and your other friends troll the *censored* out of the servers by duping d***s everywhere turns out the 4 year old had some 9 year old friends you and your friends get banned for a month congrats, you just made more enemys Host your own server  Host your own server invite all your friends all your friends join and you guys build some epic things All your enemys join All your enemys troll the *censored* out of your server Perma ban all of them and put a messgae in the reason section saying ""Instead of using the temp bans, you should learn how to perma ban!"" laugh your *censored* off. Make more friends make more enemys repeat steps 16 - 44To sum it up, In blockland, anything can happen, make friends, make enemys, build amazing things, make fun of people who make terrible things, be nice and helpful to people you like, troll the *censored* out of people you hate.10/10 Would make friends/enemys again.

												It's good. It's like multiplayer mods for Minecraft, but not as... well, let's be frank: rubbish. It's a block game where maps actually look like real things and not vague block representation of real things, and it has proper combat mechanics rather than Minecraft's, er, Minecraft. And it's very moddable without even needing any additional downloads.It's lacking polish and developer content though. It relies near-entirely on servers creating the gameplay and it's not set up well to make that easy. It's... hard to explain, but to simplify it, just about any mod is going to play perfectly functionally but look very unfinished. So it'd be really, really great if a proper professional team made a game like this!			"

												( in a morgan freeman voice) so your sitting there playing gmod and you think ""i wonder if there is another game just like this out there that has really cool servers and really cool game modes and plenty of mods."" and you think ohhhhh wait there is and then you get on steam and you look up blockland and what do you get a wonderful world filled with a ga-gillion things to do and you buy that game you start it up and you spend three days straight playing this one blocky game thats 500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 times better then minecraft. and then you wonder i wonder what them penguins are doing.

												This game for the Price is well worth it, But be mindful you must install a Addon Called RTB (Return to Blockland) as this will allow you to Download Addons ingame.Game play = 8 (Interface Could use work, Needs Workshop)Replayability = 9.5 (Addons can turn this game into anything)Fun? = 9 (Can be really fun)The Dev team really need to Revise the interface and Integrate Workshop but other than that this game is well worth the £5 i paid for it (sale) and £7 isn't un-reasonable either.

												This truly is a amazing game, its talented and just a work of art!This really does remind me of my childhood and my early days of legos, and how i would build a bunch of stuff and destroy it! But then rebuild it and create something better.Even though i only have about 50 hours on it when i start it up again it feels like a brand new game, All the add-ons and servers give you what is endless fun.And some people will say ""oh its a ROBLOX rip off!"" No not really roblox is more of a rip-off of this because Roblox was created in 2006 and Blockland was created in 2005 (so Blockland more of a Minecraft rip-off ;) )The only thing i wish of this game is to have a larger community, something a little less then roblox (no 8-11 year olds though) But we need you to make that happen.So take my advice and play this godammn game! its wourth the money (and the hours of your life it consumes)			"

												This game is very good for someone who likes to be creative and artistic as far as the building goes and the servers around give about as much content as gmod only in blocky form. I have played this game so much for its entertainment value and I recommend that anyone considering it give it a try. With the only downside being the community which comprises of a lot of trolls, spammers, and general annoying people, it is still a great game. In game name is Cavik if anyone cares to find me in game.			"

												this game does not have many people playing it.most of the servers at the moment that have people in are boring rp servers (for example office rp where you walk around and pretend to have a job). no official servers. one upside to multiplayer in this game is it is easy to make a server for example one i made a deathmatch server which diddnt take much effort.as for single player if you want a good lego building game then i recommend this one. you can download addons from the internet and make lego models on different scales. otherwise i would stay away from this one.

												I tried this out for a while and didn't enjoy it.  The controls for placing and orienting blocks are very clumsy, and to build anything above chest height you typically need to use the awkward jetpack.  It's very difficult to orient and snap things in place when you're trying to fly with the jetpack or balance on a wall while placing lego blocks, and I grew to hate the process.    Frankly, it's difficult and awkward even while standing still on ground level, and very time-consuming.  It's especially frustrating that you're limited to working with a single block at a time -- you can't grab a group of blocks and move them like you could with real blocks, and the tedium of aligning and placing each block with the really unreliable controls just sucked.After making a small room-sized building, I realized just how limited the blocks really are.  There's not a lot of interesting pieces, and it takes forever to work with even the pieces you're given to make anything.  Making even basic stuff takes an unreasonably long time because of the unreliable alignment and orientation (requiring very specific adjustments to camera angle with each block placed).  If you want to spend time creatively crafting a world, I recommend Minecraft instead as it's a lot more streamlined and there are a lot more block types and effects.  If you love legos, go buy some real ones, because this clumsy game just doesn't have the satisfying feeling of playing with legos in real life, and the process is so awkward and slow it will take you an unreasonably long time to do anything.The cart racing was mildly interesting for a round or two, but lag was crippling and the game became rapidly un-fun and un-playable, even on a low-lag server.  Once you fall into one of the many instant-death traps or pits, you have to sit and wait for the round to end (and lag usually makes sure you die sooner than later, but even without lag, the controls are terrible).  Also, you can't really do much with your cart -- building cool custom stuff on wheels just isn't available, and you apparently only get to select from pre-designed carts each round.  You appear to be able to make custom levels, and a few people have gone to the trouble, but the cart game itself is so clunky that the environments don't add much.  And most of the environments I saw were pretty boring and undetailed, which isn't surprising given the work it takes to do basic stuff.Frankly, I have trouble taking the preview images on the store page seriously.  To do that in minecraft would take a few hours; to do it in blockland would take a few weeks.  It makes me wonder if the people making those images used external tools to build the worlds, instead of the clunky in-game process.Last of all... the community is unpleasant.  There were a few nice people, but many people on multiplayer servers devote every second of their day to harassing other players, and this appeared to be actively encouraged.  They picked the most spammy, disruptive weapons and a victim and fired at him nonstop.  The super-spammer rocket launcher didn't destroy what I was trying to build, but it made progressing further impossible because my screen shook like crazy and the effects blinded me.  I felt that I was wasting my time playing on a server where someone can just hop on and start harassing me without reason, and it's not fun playing alone.  It takes too long to build anything, and you walk away feeling like the time you spent was wasted.  There are a lot of builder games out there, including early access stuff that's much more advanced than this (e.g. Space Engineers & Minecraft).Give this one a pass.  I wasted time trying it, I wasted friends' time trying it.  We all walked away disappointed and feeling cheated.  Ignore the pretty advertisement pictures; even if you had the patience to someday craft that with the bad controls and obnoxious griefers, you won't walk away satisfied or having enjoyed the process.  Game is not as advertised.			"

												Blockland is one of my favourite PC exclusive games. It was pretty much the only game I owned on Steam back then that would run for me! Lets review it.Gameplay:Blockland has gave me 50 hours (and counting) of fun gameplay, in what seemed like so little time I had alreay indulged myself into the many servers that the game has (my favourite being the PvP) until at one point I decided, ""Why should I keep playing OTHER peoples servers when I can make my own?"" not only does this statement show that servers are hosted for free but it also shows that the community made me feel welcome so much I wanted to let them into MY places. So off I went! My natural instinct was to start some sort of RP server as I knew this would only mean basic building so I could slowly get to grips with the games controls and its compelling and complex ""Event"" system that allows players to code/link things up to other things that does things? As you see I haven't delved into that but I know you probably will! Graphics:Blockland has a very unique art style within the character and models area, essentially creating a virtual Lego experience! The option for shaders* is there and the latest patches automatically enables them if your graphics card supports it! Overall nice, rich textures and unique model style never seen before.Controls:Your basic Blockland controls consist of the regular WASD keys for movement and spacebar for jumping. It's all fair and well saying this but there IS a learning curve to this game (not a curve that will take ages to learn, just some basic memorising). The key curve to this game is the building mechanics, the building has its own keybinds! Hurray! Fortunately there isn't MILLIONS of keys that make the brick move 1cm of a brick however it does consist of the numpad section. For some people the thought of this could be quite daunting however I assure you that you will learn. Jetpack as well so thats awesome, right?Conclusion:As this review has got quite long I believe it may be time to wrap this up. So overall I'm going to rate this game 9.8/10! This is by far one of the most precise ratings yet for me however the 0.2 is just for the unfortunate loss of playerbase now - it appears to be steadily decreasing... Overall awesome game. Must have for any person who is a fond fan of Minecraft and/or other sandbox based games.I hope you enjoyed my review (if you read it that is)!*For those of you who don't know, shaders basically add shadows to the game and other visual effects that overall make the graphics look MUCH nicer.

SpeedKart (Ghandi Kart) is my favorite gamemode, but it needs more maps. There are only 3 stock maps. However, there are other servers with good maps, but it's not the same as playing on a private servers with friends. Great game, I'd love to see more maps.Ghandi joined my game.10/10 would ghandi again.			"

												WOW! It has been a while since I wrote one of these, and looking back on my past reviews that I wrote when I was just a dumb kid is baffling to me to this very day. But here I am! Reviewing Blockland because I have nothing better to do!So, where do I start? Well, let me start out by saying the game has very deep building mechanics and you can make some very impressive works of art if I do say so myself. I was able to make a very DooM inspired map where you explore, kill enimies, and unlock new guns and eventually, fight a final boss. Pretty cool? While I was building the level, I was also able to make a codex system that worked pretty well. Needless to say, the scripting system is easy to learn and use, not to mention you can do some impressive things with it.Combat is pretty okay, it's not the best thing, but it gets the job done. In the vanilla game you get a standard set of weapons; pistol, dual pistols, a sword, a rocket launcher, a spear, a bow and arrow, and a ray gun that turns any living entity into a horse (Is that even a weapon?).Sound design and graphics are simple, yet effective. Models are blocky, but stylized. Not sure what it is, but I kinda like the idea of my lego looking avatar having hands and feet that aren't attached to him and float there like he's some sort of offbrand Rayman. Not to mention the lighting and render system is pretty nice too! The shadow quality is actually really nice and a lot of the effects are well done! And if you don't want things to look like it's 1:00 PM all the time, you can adjust the time of day, the shadow colors, the way shadows effect certine blocks, add snow, rain, turn your map into a ocean or an ocean of lava, and more! But all of those things are for admin use only, but pretty useful when you're in singleplayer or hosting a server... or you're an adminBut that is all vanilla, and I'd be lying if I said there was no modding community; and HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ THAT IS A ♥♥♥♥ LOAD OF MODS! There is so many ways to teak and adjust the game it is paralyzing! You can add new guns, new blocks, new scripts, you can tweak the game and fix gameplay issues, etc, etc, etc. The modding community is pretty great, but some of the players can be pretty toxic at times, such as bad admins, or as I like to call them... Badmins. Once while I was in a roleplay server (Yes, I roleplay, I know I'm a damn nerd.) and I was kicked due to the two server owners saying I was being ""OP"" and they also told me in this in my ban message... AHEM!... ""You don't know how to RP""... I don't know how to Roleplay, eh?... Alright, these guys were actually really bad roleplayers. Their grammar was bad, their charcters were bad (They were based off of Undertale characters and they were just bad OC's.) and they were pretty overpowered, but I can skim the OP part due to them being server admins, but they told me I was being OP. Funny part was, I was roleplaying as Doomguy. Not OP, but still pretty freakin' powerful! Not to mention he was totally rad! Anyway, I'm getting side-tracked.As a Sandbox game, I reccomend Blockland. I'm sure Blockland can give you a break from the normal Garry's Mod, and Minecraft, and ROBLOX that you see in todays world.			"

												I can't believe after seven measley years, and only a few dozen major updates, the developers would DARE discontinue development on this game I've only spent thousands of hours in! Turns out this is even a common action among developers on Steam! Look at this game.  The graphics look like garbage and no matter how many times I email the develpers about updating them, they never respond!!Look at this one too, can't believe I'm advertising these developers.  Again, graphics look bad and gameplay is SOOO BORING!! Every time I email the developers about updating it, no responses! To top that off, I hear they're making a sequel to it! Can't believe they're gonna make me pay again when you can't even fix your first game. Nice work, jerks.Don't even get me started on the community! For some reason, unlike in every other facet of life, all the people who play this are all rude and mean! This is so drastically unprecedented, I hold this to be 100% the fault of the developers.Oh and there's some minigame where you build things with blocks I didn't try that at all.			"

												Blockland. Virtual legos. Sounds great right? On the surface it looks great, but in reality, its nothing as great as it looks. The trailer is a typical falsehood of what the game actually is. The best way I can describe it is a gilded turd. On the surface, it looks good, but once you get into it, you're left thinking ""What the heck is this garbage?"" A good game should not have the player stop and think ""What am I doing? Why am I wasting my time with this?""Secondly, the server browser is absolutely terrible. The game modes and activites they show in the trailer are hard to come by. You will probably find 1 in 50 servers that holds your interest. Unless you have the attention span of a 6 year old, you wont find this entertaining. Which leads into my next point. The community.A game based off of virtual legos is obviously going to keep the interest of young, simple minded children rather than experienced gamers. The most mature thing you will come across in this game is a pathetic ""Your mom"" joke. Lets keep the legos as a child's toy, not a pathetic excuse for a video game. DO  NOT BUY THIS. Garry's Mod would be a much better investment. The community is mature, and the game-modes are more complete. Save your money. "

I hate saying this but.. yeah, the community is cancer. ROBLOX WAS NEVER COMPETING WITH THIS GAME.

												I have been a part of the Blockland community for a total of over 4 years and I can say that Blockland was one of the best 20 dollars (at the time) i have spent. I have met many players that I still keep in touch with daily today.Gameplay wise, it is an original experience that you won't find anywhere else. The game does NOT run like Minecraft at all, a generalization made by alot of players. The eventing system makes it easy to make your own gamemodes and advanced creations (from an MIDI synth to a Pong simulator to rainbow cars) and this title will be a hit between all fans of anything LEGO. Multiplayer is great too. It is very solid and I have come across minimal problems trying to play. If you really want to know what i'm talking about, give it a whirl. Especially now that it is on sale.			"

Not to mention, the game's shaders looks terrible, with Anti-aliasing broken and not much of graphics settings. It's like a Steam version of Roblox.

Watch, as people fly headfirst into other people's builds, with their rocket boots! And scream, at the terrible controls. Wanna place a block? Sure! Just press ctrl+4+l+g+p+a+,+click! Wanna make the block and colour other than red? That'll be another six buttons! And for a bargain of only 10$! What else would you want to spend that on? A good game? A life? Bathsalts to eat?

												Like the trailer? Good! Because that's about the only thing you'll like about this game! Come play in our lobbies, full of screaming five year olds who think they have a good mic! Explore, the thousands of servers all of which are based on FNAF, and have an astonishing amount of control freaks that have never been told ""no"" in their life! Watch, as people fly headfirst into other people's builds, with their rocket boots! And scream, at the terrible controls. Wanna place a block? Sure! Just press ctrl+4+l+g+p+a+,+click! Wanna make the block and colour other than red? That'll be another six buttons! And for a bargain of only 10$! What else would you want to spend that on? A good game? A life? Bathsalts to eat? Just about anything that isn't block land!This is what hell feels like			"

												The game itself is fantastic, But I have not seen a worser community. Think people in gmod pick on you for being a noob? The people in the community pick on you for not knowing how to change your name. If you ask for help you are gonna be called a retard, a moron. SOme players are just trolls altogether. This game has good building and it's npcs and vehicals and everything but the community are good.I think they should also make it somewhat free to play. There are games like roblox that are free and make there money off ads and customization of players. But just get the original owners of this game some sort of items.			"

												This game is very bland and boring. And to download addons is very complicated. And the people and zombies that you spawn dont fight each other. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't exactly expecting a shooting game. Also another thing, why does there have to be  ghost block? I mean why can't you just with your mouse place a block down and move it after if you want to. One more thing. The jet mechanic functions sloppily.			"

												Ignore my hours on Steam, I used to play this a lot before it was released onto this platform. This used to be a great game in 2008, back when the community was booming and there was thousands of add-ons. There was plenty of servers with a large number of players occupying them because of how broad and expansive this game was. Now though? Not so much. Every update that came out slowly made this game worse and worse. RTB got closed down, which rendered a lot of the great add-ons useless and boring, the game died off and now it's just a worthless library filler. I used to love playing this game all those years ago, now I don't even have the heart to load it up and wonder why I still have it installed. Just buy Garrys Mod instead if you don't already have it, if you have Garrys Mod do not and I mean DO NOT buy this game. All you will do is complain about how♥♥♥♥♥♥it is and claim it to be a GMod rip off.			"

												This game is a fun little one. It's like Minecraft and LEGO cross-bred, but the fun does not stop there. Add-ons are simple to make (easy as adding a couple of faces for your blockhead), controls are easy, other players are friendly. Servers also are fun to play on, many feature add-ons to make the game even more fun!In conclusion, get it. It's worth it.			"

												Parents need to know that Blockland is an open-ended, exploration and creation focused environment. One of the best-selling, independently developed and published video games, Blockland's official release was in November 2011 following a lengthy beta test phase that attracted millions of players. Players can create items and buildings from scratch using materials they harvest from the world around them. There is no story, but players will encounter aggressive monsters they can fight using swords and bows. Graphics are extremely blocky, and there is no blood or gore, but the creatures can be a bit scary when they over sexually moan or appear seemingly out of nowhere to molest the players winky. Parents should note that this game has a thriving online community hosted by private, non-moderated servers. This means players could encounter offensive content in the form of profane text messages and suggestively shaped player-created structures, although players don't have to engage in online activity to enjoy the game. Thanks Notch!			"

Can you believe that♥♥♥♥♥♥!! The community needs to get there♥♥♥♥♥♥together and act mature like all the other players in the gaming world/Internet.

												The hell have they done to my favorite game ever?I've clocked hundreds of hours into this game since before it's steam release, had it since about 2008. The community was alive, there were some great community made mods thanks to Return to Blockland (modding community, sorta like Steam Workshop), there was lots to do and lots of people to do it with. Now, it's dead... mods aren't as easy to find, and all the maps are FLAT! what happened to Bedroom? kitchen? all the classic maps that were fun as hell!? If the year was 2010, i'd tell you to buy this game because it's awesome... but it's 2015 and the game is completely ruined.Rating in 2010: 10/10Rating in 2015: 3/10			"

												This game...I just don't know what to say. You can do pretty much everything; play a uniqe shooter game, with guns that turn people into horses! Create some of the biggest things anyone's ever seen with your friends. Or you could just...you know...run around with a rocket launcher and destroy everything in sight. Infinite possibilities.The building machanic is pretty confusing, but it's very satisfying, for some odd reason. The wrench is the thing I use most often; I love scripting and making complex things!Overall, I love it, and definately reccommend this game to whoever likes building games with many possibilities!

												This game is bassicly bunch of user created content.So in blockland we have user mods like - Death race. which is race who will get trought obstacles and winJailbreak. Which is something like Gmod has or counter strike has but with this game having no VOIP makes it complete random deathmatch.Also there's just team deatmatches and other shooting games. Gun play in such game is actually not that bad for block type gameAnd also there is roleplay mod but again which isn't much roleplay other then random shooting. Game is pretty laggy and psyhics are glitchy.  Daily players i would say are about 200 people or so. Sounds- ♥♥♥♥ing horrible im saying right now. It's horrible. Games quality is not the best you can see polishing needed to be done. Game is something new to try BUT DO NOT RECOMMEND 10 EUROS on this crap so please don't buy it.			"

Many people Wants Servers with Addons, and what Not back when I was Back onto Playing Blockland (I PLAYED THE DEMO) It felt Great, Hosted Some Servers, Now I host Pixel Art Servers, And I Always Will Do that. Maybe I'll Get bored and Do Something Else, Like: Making Pictures, or, Building a Skyscraper, or Host a Deathmath minigame. It's Endless possibilities! Adding Addons is way simple than Minecraft!

												whilst can be a fun sandbox game, this games building mechanics are frustrating, very complex and entirely non-noob friendly. about two years from buying this for two bucks I still find my self frustrated building a simple shack, and to get better tools you must go to the mod website and download a couple of tools that also need some explaining done.now that that is overwith, lets get on to multiplayer.you can find a decent amount of servers built by the community, some titled ""Joni's TownRPG"" or ""Military RP"" which the second one takes a heavy amount of addons and mods which shouldn't take long. anyway, the TownRPG mode is run by ten year olds who tower over you expecting you to do everything they say. shall you rebel against them and they spray a bunch of random incomprihensible blabber at you before banning you. if you do get farther than that you have to become a farmer and build a house, which takes more than a couple of hours and if you are lucky if they won't destroy it after you build it.atleast thats what happened in that server.Military RP is quite fun, atleast sometimes. you start off as a recruit, gather weapons and get in a vehicle and battle out in a decently large battlefield. fun sometimes yet not all the time.JailRP is another one where you are either a guard or a prisoner, obviously enough as a guard you guard and make sure the prisoners aren't doing anything too suspicous and as a prisoner you work together to escape, or take over the prison. if you know the secret areas there isn't much point in being a guard as prisoners will almost always win once the secret area is broken as they huddle in gathering akimbo pistols before killing each and every one of the guards.there are ""parkour"" servers which has a bunch of unfair platforms you miraclely have to jump on with a promising admin gift at the end.

												Blockland is a horror suvivor MMORPG game that is based on the Marvel universe. You start playing as Morgan Freeman right after he escaped Black Mesa when the cascade arrived. Now he has to fight to find his lost daughter. You will hear the line ''I will find you and I will kill you'' a lot this game as it is a metaphore for how he entered the Moonlight server on WoW. This game's soundtrack that is composed my Jesper Klyd is much better than COD's soundtrack will ever be and has ever been, hands down. The most important thing is to note is that the art design was made by the composers of Fruity loops the music software. The game also has a lot of fun that is not just the quests. The game is obviously Open-world Fallout-ish type of game where your choices matters just as much as it matters in Telltale games like back 2 the past. The game is not P2W because of daily quests. I give this game an Gaben/5.			"

												Blockland, I loved you so much. I really did. Back in my day, if you didn't buy the game, Badspot would personally murder your dog.But I cannot recommend it anymore. The community has gone ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, like an unstoppable cancerous tumor of ROBLOX manchildren. The developer has stopped developing the game for some time and is being a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Look at some of the developer comments towards other people's reviews. Go ahead, take a look. He's advertising Blockland on negative reviews and is leaving sarcastic douchy comments. He killed one of the more important aspects of Blockland when he wanted some crappy shaders added to the game, I don't even know what to say anymore.Oh and to top it all of, I got banned permanently from the Steam Community Forums of Blockland for ""Trolling/Garbage post"". My post was a sarcastic post being targeted towards the children who came over to say that Blockland is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Minecraft/Roblox rip-off. It was something common when the game was new on steam. It was my first ""Offense"", No penatly no nothing, Immideate ban from the community forums. I sent an E-mail to the support team or whatever the hell they listed it as and got no response.Thanks you badspot for the good times I used to have, And ♥♥♥♥ you very much for killing it off.			"

												Lego Worlds is an excellent party trickIt's incredibly cheap, so buy a four pack and mess around with friends for a few hours. I've never actually played an online server, but I don't care to because the rest of the game was good enough. The amount of scripting put into the wrench tool means that you can make a Christmas tree that shoots beams that transform things into horses in no time. Oh, and there's a building system too, but it's too complex for my simple mind.The game is the best Lego game.(Please note this game is not officially made by Lego)			"

												A friend once asked me if this was another Minecraft knockoff. Here is my opinion on the matter.This game is nothing like minecraft. You do not have to build a house to survive the onslaught of monsters in the night (unless it is part of a special play mode, it has several modes), you don't dig into the ground. This game is far more similar to ROBLOX, a free to play mmo where you build whatever you want for the sake of building it and playing minigames with friends. In the sense that it has blocks and you can build things tho, yes, it is similar to Minecraft, except just like in ROBLOX you will build these things from choices in a menu, you do not collect materials as in Minecraft. Minecraft is about survival, mining and crafting. On the other hand it is unlike any other game specifically, because yes there are a lot of games with blocks with which you can build things out there, but that does not make them all a cheap ripoff of one another. This game is about hanging out and letting your imagination run free!I hope that clears it up a bit.			"

												I have been playing Blockland for the better part of my life, as cheesy as that sounds. In my opinion, it is a great game. The creativeness is very contemplating. I would rate this game five stars. Five stars without the Community. The community is horrid. Over the past few years the community has becoming worse and worse. Almost everyone are a bunch of screaming, crying kids. They are disrespectful, dishonorable, and terrible. Just take a look at it for yourself[forum.blockland.us]. There are a bunch of egotistical brats who spend a lot more of their time beating down people on the forums then playing the actual game themselves. It is near impossible to find a server that is full of good people who will teach you how to play the game and be nice to you. Most people are discriminate and will banish you from your server on sight.The game is great without the community, and I would rate it five stars in a heartbeat. But buying this game is quite testy since the major part of Blockland is it’s community. One bad apple can spoil the bunch, except the bunch are the bad apples. Looking behind the bad bunch are good people too. There are still a few people who are very creative, helpful, and kind. You may find a few friends too.I have more information about the game as well as a few interesting sites on a review I did on my blog. View it here.[blog.jakobjones.com] "

												Very fun game, love it. You can just build anything! (Or be lazy and just load bricks! :P) There are things like prison break servers, city car driving (the best bit) and speed carts and stuff, and there are some servers where its just free build. So, i would recommend this game, though because its quite old and a bit less good than other games, I would highly recommend getting Minecraft instead of this if i were to choose.			"

												This is one of the most awful games I have ever played, If I had reviewed this in 2009, I would've said that I would reccomend it. They took out maps like the Bedroom, Kitchen, Artic, and flat groundless backgrounds as well, I can't start a freebuild server on single player, obviously a blalant copy of ROBLOX and Minecraft, not much people play the game anymore, the achievements are hidden, limited apparel and cosmetics, released from the times when !@#$ Mongler was a popular meme, abusive admins on every server I can go, does not support the Steam Workshop like a good game would. If you want to spend $10 on a game that you would enjoy, DO NOT BUY THIS! You'd be better off gifting your copy you own to some uncanny noob who has no idea how much you suffered when you bought this junk. If you want to buy this outdated game, you are wasting your money on garbage. Bottom Line: It sucks and the creators can go bankrupt for all we care. Just go buy some LEGOS and you would have the same damn expierence rather than wasting $10 on a game worst than Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric. Don't buy this crap, just buy Five Nights at Freddy's and you've spent your money on a GOOD GAME. Might as well get some Trading Cards and say you bought this garbage...			"

Only true Blocklandiers like myself can enjoy Blockland's cummies, not normies like Roblox or Minecraft noobs. You can have more than ♥♥♥♥ing blocks in this game. You can have ♥♥♥♥ING TRIANGLES. MOTHER. ♥♥♥♥ING. TRIANGLES. CAN YOU HAVE THAT IN MINECRAFT? NO YOU CAN'T! BUT HERE IN BLOCKLAND YOU CAN! ROBLOX? NAH, ♥♥♥♥ THOSE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AWFUL CONTROLS. BLOCKLAND'S CONTROLS ARE LIKE BUTTER AND PEA SOUP--THE BEST ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ COMBO OF FOODS EVER. OH, YOU'VE NEVER HAD BUTTER AND PEA SOUP? THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME A GOD AND YOU A NORMIE REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! Anyways, this game is a 10/10 for me.			"

												i have wanted this game for a while and when i got it, i realized that Roblox (btw its free) had more content and more players than this the only thing nice about this game is probably the view aka the Shadowing, anamations, and lightingbasicly this is roblox but less stuff and you have to pay for it, but if you want to buy it thats not my fault because i made the mistake of buying this instead of g-mod wich is also $9.99little to none of the things you see in the trailer are in the game its either turf wars or kart raceingor shooting your friends for no reason at all			"

												Really fun game, but sadly not as popular as it once was. That, and there's been a lack of updates for about...2 years, now?It's one of those games that'll get stale after you play it too often, but after taking a long, long break, it can come back and be fun again. It's like short bursts, almost.I logged so many hours into this game when I was younger, before it was on Steam. Sadly, nowadays, this game just sits in my library collecting dust.I'd still recommend it if you like these kinds of games. It may even grab your attention more than it did mine.			"

												As much as PC gamers hate to admit it, there are children who play PC games. Blockland can be considered that step from child to fully-fledged gamer.

												I have played this game since 2012 (back when it wasn't on Steam) and had a decent experience. The game was fun and fresh, the community was decent, and the game was well updated. Unfortunately it seems in the past year the developer has given up on it, there's not much new content, the community is very hostile now, and the game has died. The game is dead.Let me be clear - I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME. Even if you do buy it I HIGHLY recommend avoiding the community.1) No new updates. The most recent update was back in December and was just a few bug fixes and tweaks. The developer only updates the game whenever there's a critical issue. I remember the game used to get all sorts of new updates to make it fresh and fun. Now it's an abandoned game waiting to die completely.2) Very, very hostile and rude community. There's this place called the Blockland Forums, don't go there. Ever. They yell, swear, argue at each other all the time and are very rude to new players who are just recently joining the forum. They have a board dedicated to drama in the community which causes 99% of the hostility in the community. I unfortunately have been a member of this forum for at least a year and regret it very much. Everyone there harassed me, hated me, and overall being on the forum made me a worse person.3) The game is dead. It's lost most of it's players when the developer stopped updating it which for someone like me makes the game really boring. I can't bother playing the game for more than half an hour before going and playing something else. The multiplayer servers are boring, no one makes cool stuff anymore, and if there is any good games no one is on them which makes those good games boring.I used to love this game. I'd play it everyday and was very good at it. Unfortunately times have changed and now the game is no good and just needs to die off.			"

Along with all the 5 year olds, idiots, jerks, hackers, and bad administrators. This made me never touch my old Lego sets again since the game was based off of Legos. Then I found Blockland. I have to say buying it was one of the best choices I've ever made. It brought back my loving of Legos. A better variety of games, regular and mature gamers. This game is what ROBLOX used to be. If you want my opinion and you have or still do play that thing they call a game, BUY THIS!			"

												As much as PC gamers hate to admit it, there are children who play PC games. Blockland can be considered that step from child to fully-fledged gamer. Similar to ROBLOX in gameplay and nature, but with more focus on adult themes than ROBLOX. You can mae your avatar Pedobear, for God's sake.			"

												Great game. I've played this game for about four years, And i've never gotten completely bored of it. I love every aspect of it, its simply the type of game you just wanna get on and build stuff! The community is great, it's not that hard to find new friends. If you are the type of person that likes garry's mod minecraft or any other sandbox game, I reccomend this. Keep in mind that the developer of the game has completely quit on Blockland. But players still mod the game itslef, so it never really gets ""old"". :D			"

But some of the players I've seen online are very skilled and have made beautiful masterpieces.  So if you are up for a very tough building challenge get this game.  I'm sticking with fun and simple Roblox/Minecraft style games instead.			"

												All though there are downsides to this game, like the lack of updates and the behaviour from some of the players. I love playing this game with my friends.If you do buy the game, it is recommended that you change your name and avatar first, players can be harsh to new players with a default name/avatar (blockheadBLID). If you're entirely new, try your own servers and screw around so you know what your doing on other people's.I have been playing since late v19 (before it was on steam) and I always loved to play it, Even though there are no more maps, you can still make a good out of it. For me odly, Blockland seems to work better on my OLD computers better than my newer ones (unless its a Duel core, then it works fine).I wouldn't recommend it for ages 1-10 as it's online interation has Drug Reference, Sexual themes, and lots of voilence/cursing.Bottom line, this game is recommended for the creative and adventerous user.

												 Blockland is one of the best Lego games of all time. The game can make you build anything. Like a city, a ship, a landmark, anything you want. Thanks to the ""Trust"" system, there is no griefers online. You can't build or destroy other player's bricks unless you have grant trust (You have be on the menu and on the player list to give them trust). You can play with a friend or a lot of people in your server. This game made me stop playing Roblox and Minecraft due to its simple eventing and a better community. You can create a zombie game, a free build, a death match or a roleplay. Major downside is their might be bad servers but, the game is great. There is a mini-game system that you can make what ever game you wanted. Game is awesome. Go try it out.			"

												All though there are downsides to this game, like the lack of updates and the behaviour from some of the players. I love playing this game with my friends.If you do buy the game, it is recommended that you change your name and avatar first, players can be harsh to new players with a default name/avatar (blockheadBLID). If you're entirely new, try your own servers and screw around so you know what your doing on other people's.I have been playing since late v19 (before it was on steam) and I always loved to play it, Even though there are no more maps, you can still make a good out of it. For me odly, Blockland seems to work better on my OLD computers better than my newer ones (unless its a Duel core, then it works fine).I wouldn't recommend it for ages 1-10 as it's online interation has Drug Reference, Sexual themes, and lots of voilence/cursing.Bottom line, this game is recommended for the creative and adventerous user.

												Kind of boring, and it takes a lot of time to make the game fun. It has the potential to be a good game, but if you like to play games that are easy to learn, have a good story, a lot of content, and/or are like me, and don't have a lot time to play games, or don't play games too often, Blockland isn't for you.

												one of the best games i have come accross yet! although 7 Days to die may have been a LAG MACHINE and sorta weak, this game let's you easily build, fight, and...well, grief! i built a HUGE map for dayZ and am going to get a dayz mod! also, those COD and CS fanz out there, keep your pants on. That segment's up next!Building... i'd give it a 8.5/10. It gives an... Accurate and detailed, Yet fast, way for building through ""Ghost Blocks"", and easily lets you make HUGE structures. This game had me addicted for 5 weeks... AND COUNTING! Now, for those Hyperactive, Spaztic no-scope, Quickscope, 720 Headshotters, ( lol yes, quick and no scope XD) here's the First Person Shooter portion!  This game adds a lil' indie, roblox, and quake in a way to say it! this is the mine-blox version of CS... i give it... a 9/10... mostly because you have to add on a mod to get more than a single gun in the game, but after all, it is a Kid's game. So. no gore, no...uhhm.. Guts..?And there ya go. That wraps it up with a rocketting score of.... {[( 17.5/20 )]}			"

												A cross between minecraft and legos but without polish or enjoyment.  Trying to do the achievements is hard because the MP is nearly dead, and the kart experience is just horrible, with WASD controls and illogical physics.  I got this in a bundle for about a dime and I barely think I got my money's worth.The freebuild is like minecraft, but not as good, so why not just do minecraft?  I guess the legos (let's face it, they ripped off lego shapes) are more interesting to place than minecraft squares, but the UI isn't so easy to work with either.  All in all, it needs alot more work to be worth more than a bundle grab for <US$1			"

												Minded thriller, I wanted to buy this game. But as I got this game was somewhat simple, covering only 58 MB. After downloading the game, I went to START GAME and I went tutorial. When I walked through the tutorial, I threw in some kind of map of where everything was green and I had to just block, at the time the game was bad, even though the game is written BLOCKLAND is non-linear sandbox game with no goals, giving players the freedom to design and construct complex structures. Styled as a tiny minifigures players to build inside the virtual world, using bricks reminiscent of toy blocks. These structures can be built in any single player or multiplayer (or over the Internet or local area network). I came out of the game and clicked JOIN TO GAME. I went to a random server and nužinojau that BLOCKLAND is a really good game, better than Minecraft, thanks to the Creator, a really good game.

Product received for free
Simply Boring,i just found it. . . boring. i was gifted this game by a friend, who insisted this was a great and fun game. so i accepted the gift and started playing. i joined a room with him, and instantly war bored, i expressed this and he told me ""just learn the toutorial, you can then see what the game has in store! a whole one, poorly made, boring toutorial later. i still had no clue what this game was about, so i jumped into some mini games, which he insisted were amazing. and again, i didnt have a negitive experance, just a bored one. also to note: the controls were terrible and confusing, for example, left click is ""ghost"" a block (see where you are putting the block) and numpad enter, is to actually place it. so i have to use my mouse hand to press ""place"" to actually build things. i feel like this game could entertain different types of people, and that person is not me. maybe my friend can give the copy i gave back to him to a 7 year old who is too poor to run lego worlds. if i did have to give it a 1 - 10 rating, it would be a 2/10.

												Blockland Review - Raymond K. Turcotte - *Update* (Again) ( I origanaly said this was a ""Minecraft Ripoff"" This is a message to those who replied in a negative way) I really find some people on Steam are takeing my Review the wrong way. So what if my opinion isn't the same as yours? I'm not going to become a Conformist just because everyone else thinks it's a master peice. Again. This game i'd recommend to 6 or 7 year old. Because it's like a Lego game. Actually when i put it that way. It's a Lego ""Ripoff""I decided to make a List of Pros and ConsPROS: The Few advantages of playing Minecraft, Blockland and others like it is it prepares you for life.  The obvious one is carpentry, building houses, underground lairs, whatever. You eventually develop skills that could be useful.  Another note is it's life itself. You chat with people online. You don't trust the nearby nood who you just met with a one of your guns, will you? No, obviously not. Players will develop trust issues with other players online. Just like in the real world. The players will develop friendships as well, because the players avatars are in form of human. It's life.CONS: It's just like the leading competitor and very popular game ""Minecraft"" or/and basically copying the whole concept from an all time popular toy game ""Lego"" So remember when you play this game. They copied/Stole the idea from someone else. Players could be nasty with one another online. Throwing violent words at each other, It's supposed to be a child's game! No violence. (Swear words) It's because of these game were children develop ""Bad attitudes"" and/or ""Bad languages ""Because of the Adults/Teenagers who play these games and get angry.  When people wonder on ""why children these days are so mean,"" Think about this game!I keep my point stable I don't recommened this Game!!!!			"

I cant play it cause 1 , it has block graphics, It really should be improved, ive seen games that are amazing, and another thing, this game has no lands, you have too create it all on your own, I would like the game too have something fun to do besides build. I know my time is 4.5 hours on record but thats cause i TRIED too play it, i liked it for the first 5 minutes and got bored of it, I wish there was crafting and stuff like that, And i know it says it has freedom too design but its a bit too much freedom, it feels boring when someone does this sort of thing. It was good for 5 minutes, then i quit, Just does not have any great stuff too look forward too and may i add, they havent done a patch since 2014, and its almost 2016 now. So please do not buy this game if you want multiple patches every so often.			"

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												NEVER EVER buy this game! Don't trust the trailers, there aren't any jets or airplanes.You will have to donwload bonus stuff. It's like making a gmod trailer with all the addons. You will hate it when you played Terraria or minecraft. It looks like an 1990's lego game with 1 colour textures. I could have made the game with paint and blender. Please, Don't buy it. I regret this purchase.			"

												Dead game. Devoplers are not active. Servers are cheap. I suggest another game, worth 2 bucks. May be old but they charge too much for this game.			"

This game feels like a poor mans p*ssy version of Roblox, Minecraft and every other wanna-be block LEGO building sh*t heap of a game. What a piece of sh*t.Barely any sound effects, the game is quiet and f*cking boring.I'd say it's maybe its good for kids, but when you crash, you basically die and scream like you're dying a slow painful death. That shows a good example of your character ""re-trying"".Holy f*ck this sucks.1/10 "
