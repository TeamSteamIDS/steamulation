												Suspect developer.  After getting a black screen (of my 39 Steam games, this is the only game I have issues with), I contacted the developer and left a message on the forum.  He responded that my computer didn't meet minimum qualifications and I should have checked before purchasing.My computer: AMD A8 3.4 ghz x4, 11gb RAM, Win 7, AMD 7700 HD 1gbThis far exceeds the listed minimum and recommended specifications.  I would be very careful purchasing this game.  You should avoid the headache.  Apparently, the game itself isn't very good as well.  Not that I can play it.  So I could leave this review, I had to let the black screen run for a total of five minutes.  Lol.I see the idiot developer left a response.  It's different from his original response which lied and said he never supported AMD.  Apparrently, shortly thereafter, he included support for it.  MK Lab, you are one shady SOB.First comment from the devleoper:MK-Lab  [developer] Jan 27, 2015 @ 2:18pm  Your graphics card (AMD) is not supported like I said several times before. Check out the system requirements! This game support right now only nVidia graphics card.			"

												I played the game, and got thru the first level no problem, but need to improve my bonus stars. I enjoyed this game. Some early growing pains for developer because some users don't have updated AMD drivers.Game looks good, Plays ok too.  I really enjoy testing the bridge I create!  HINT: You need to press the RED button to test your Bridge!Also, the default seems to have stress test colors OFF, so don't forget to press Green Button to turn them on.Full Disclosure: I received game key to test this game and it seems fine to me. The Developer is a good guy, give him a chance and he will work hard to fix problems.			"

												At first, the game looks good enough, but the lack of tutorials for new players or any sort of discussion to ease new players into the game doesn't exactly make me glad I bought the game.			"

												i had a lot of fun with this game, it is, what it says.  the game is on a bit of a narrow path, as far as getting creative goes, it is set up as more of a ""challenge"" type scenario, where you are rather limited on the parts available to you.  aside from those few things, its a good, fun time filler!

												It is a fun and easy to play game. It's a lot like other bridge games out there like PolyBridge and Bridge Project; though this game is more restrictive that I would wish for it is definently as good as any other bridge building game on Steam, but for under a third of the price.			"
