												This is an outstanding game. This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.Highs:* Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.* Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.* Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.* Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.Lows:* The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000. * Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it's almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.* The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don't often line up well. My metro station might say ""100 per week"" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.Verdict:If you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept. I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre, and this is not one of those. Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessible.			"

												In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  Everything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.Now pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. The game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.

												Let me give you a history lesson.  In 1989 Simcity was relased.  And it was great.In 1994 SimCity 2000 was released and it was great.In 1999 SC3k was released, and it was also, great.  (Are you seeing a theme here?)In 2003, SimCity 4 was released, and it was perfection.Now... it gets sad.2007 brought us SimCity Socities, which was a thing.And in 2013 brought us Sim City.  And Im sure you know what its miraid of problems was.Now finally, 12 years after the last great city building game comes Skylines.  By NOT trying to do all the interconnected and multiplayer garbage that sunk a decade of titles, Collossal Order has hit one out of the park.  Runs great on older machines, looks great, and has GREAT mod support.In all honesty, while writing the introduction I was trying to think of a negative element that came up.  Still dont have one.Buy this game.			"

												So I made my first city, getting it from zero to eight thousand when I finally unlocked dams. At this point I was doing terrible with electricity, because I really didn't want to make many coal plants, so the second I saw Dams unlocked I saved to make one. I found a great spot that could solve my energy needs forever, and placed the dam. As I clicked I knew I made a terrible mistake. I made the dam directly beside the densest part of my Residential District. Water poured over the side of the dam and into the city, drowning my population and creating abandoned buildings. When the water finally calmed down it was in the form of a lake in the center of the city, halfway in residential, halfway in commercial. In an attempt to fix this I started pumping the water out (which actually seems to have worked), but I put the output in a place where it flowed into both of my main water pumps. And while I was only pumping plain water out of my city, the game counted it as waste water. I was feeding my citizens fresh water poop. So while water was killing the center of my city, poop water was killing the rest. The surge of water also managed to destroy my garbage collection, so I got this terrible mix of overflowing rivers, overflowing garbage, and overflowing sickness.All in all an absolutely hilarious experiance. Great game.			"

UPDATED MARCH 2016Alright, let me start this off with this. If you already love city-builders, this is for you. If you don't already like city-builders, this is a great place to start!I personally love city-building games and I can't really believe that many of the things that they acomplished (either totally  or partially) were done. The traffic AI has been greatly improved since release.Pros:- CURVY ROADS- Adustable height of the roads allowing for customized interchanges- Renewable Energy is the main power source that you will use.- Train/Subway/Bus Routs are editable and can be color coordinated.- Cities grow based upon services and leisure and educated near them.- Mods, 74,000+ mods.- Intuituve Menu Layout- Great AI- Base Game is worth the priceCons: - DLC has too little content for too high a price.Yeah that's all the cons. If I had to I would give this game a very nice 93/100. It's got a lot of polish added to it and it's worth every cent you put into it. Buy this, you won't regret it at all.			"

												Saw this game on the front page, never knew about it. As of writing this review, I've only played for six hours and I've already restarted four times because the streets weren't straight enough and I went into debt rebuilding them. PROS:No EA.No EA Origin.Did I mention no EA involved?Also no EA.-New land purchasing now gives players a choice of when and where to expand, not just confining them to a small square of limited development.-Road tools give players much more freedom to create and weave around the city, upgrading also made easy as well. (Simcity 2013's upgrade roads had an idea going but you had to level an entire street to get anywhere, completely negating the point)-Being able to relocate a civil building for much cheaper than destroying removes the hassle of trying to redo roads around a public service due to a single building.-Still has well-working fluid and sewage dynamics, taking what SimCity 5 attempted with their pollution system and actually turning it into something good.-Parks affect the lives of citizens without taking ungodly amounts of space, and much like a real park one large park that is easily accessible more than a few hundred small parks all around the city wasting space. (cough cough SimCity 2013)-Even though the water dynamics are a little rough as of right now, the game still gives an option for a hydroelectric dam; a feat previously impossible in SimCity 2013 and unimaginably difficult in SimCity 4.The only thing I don't like about this game so far?@Developers #The #twitter-like #announcements #and #the #constant #usage #of #hashtags (I get the point but I feel like my city is composed of preteens.)So far and still hours later, 10/10.**EDIT 5/23/2015**I've found that the developers of the game themselves are very active and receptive in their own community at r/citiesskylines and actually listen to their users.Developers also cranked out FREE and well-done DLC, like it's supposed to be.Game still kicks ♥♥♥!

												Things I can do in Cities: Skylines that I couldn't do in SimCity (5)- Play without an internet connection- Name my city something rude like PantyFlash- Edit terrain in a nice map editor- Play without logging into Origin...- Actually have simulated people whose actions make sense*** Every person has their own name and a constant house where they live ***- Manage traffic properly- Have funI have been a big SimCity fan for many years. I've collected the games and have tried my best to stay loyal to the brand because most SimCity games brought me many hours of gameplay and joy. When SimCity Societies came out, I received it for free with another game I had purchased. I must admit... it was one of the weakest SimCity games I had played but I still put some time into it because I appreciated that the Maxis team had tried something different.Then SimCity (5) happened... I was one of those suckers that actually went out and bought a hard copy of the game the day it released. Heck I had been waiting for about 10 years and when I spent what is roughly $45 dollars I thought it was worth it because this is SimCity! I played the game for about a week and then went played SimCity 2000 instead. Yes that's right, I would rather play a game made in 1994 than one made in 2013. And when SimCity came out with an expansion pack for it a few months after release, I was done. Done with SimCity. A game that I have played and loved my entire life. The first PC game I owned other than solitaire and that crazy pinball game that came with Microsoft =.=.So long live Cities: Skylines. Long live Collosal Order. 9/10PS: Found a link earlier this week about Maxis and EA. Apparently EA is closing Maxis down. Give it a read. http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/03/04/its-a-sim-ea-closes-simssimcity-developer-maxis/  What do you guys think about this? Feel free to comment.Also please keep in mind that the comments made on SimCity 5 are based on my experience with the game when it originally released and not patches and ammendments that have been made to the game since then.

Cities Skylines Review Its been a long time since a really good City Builder has been on the market so every time there is a whisper of a new one being developed, fans of the genre like myself become eager with anticipation. Unfortunately, we have been left wanting for nearly a decade. Yes, its been that long since a really decent sim has been released. Upon learning that one of my favorite publishers, Paradox Interactive, had a City Building simulation in the works I knew this was a game I could not wait to get my hands on. Paradox Interactive is known for being a leader in challenging and entertaining  strategic games so I felt if anybody could do it right, they could. Having been able to test the game for almost a full week before its official release I can say that my trust was not misplaced. Cities Skylines is everything I hoped it would be. This is city building done right.I have played most every City Building game ever made and consider myself somewhat of an expert in the genre. Perhaps I am over-critical at times when it comes to my favorite gaming genre but it comes from the desire to find the Holy Grail in city sims. I can honestly say, Cities Skylines is far and above, the best city building simulation ever made. Period. Colossal Order has come up with a recipe that ingenuously combines just the right amount of simplistic game design with a flavorful amount of challenging gameplay to create a masterpiece. Fans of City Building simulations will definitely not want to miss grabbing this game.There is a very realistic feel to this game. Its not just about throwing out color-coded building zones, but more about true city management. Do things right and your populus will be greatful and steadily grow. Do things poorly and your city will clear out faster than a zombie apocalypse could make it happen. Numerous tools are at your disposal as expected with an interesting dynamic that truly brings the realism into the game. Cities can be carved up into different districts and each district can have its own set of policies and characteristics. Players even choose the names. But it doesn't just stop there. Players can give custom names to just about everything in the game including its citizens. Transportation and pollution will be key challenges as with any game of this type. Having experience with previous endeavors like the Cities in Motion series, Colossal Order has easily found a way to challenge players along these lines. Cars and trains, ships and planes. Cities Skylines has it all. The water simulation is spectacular as well. Placing your sewage disposal upstream, for example, could result in contaminating your citizens' water supply. Realistic flooding is another possible scenario. The maps included are gigantic and beautifully designed terrains that offer endless possibilites when planning your city and continued population growth unlocks the ability to expand to adjacent tiles on the map as well as making more buildings and options available (such as taking out loans). These options are tied in with overall success and not just simply from having enough funds available, a feature which definitely enhances the experience.I could go on and on about all of the things I admire about this game. The graphics are solid but not overly done which allows for most systems to be able to run this game smoothly. The UI is easy to use and understand. The ""Chirper"" social media feature is a clever modern touch that keeps mayors abreast of public opinion and concerns. And, perhaps one of this game's best features is the inclusion of asset and map editting tools to allow the Steam Community to heavily mod this game in order to continue its growth and stability in the future while adding tons of extra content and replay value. In fact, about the only area I found lacking in this game is not having a variety of random events such as natural disasters. I cannot say with certainty why the developers chose not to include them and perhaps they will be added later as DLC since most Paradox Interactive games are known to offer quality additional content long after initial releases. The modding community could possibly offer them as well, since I predict the Steam Workshop will quickly fill up with a large variety of added content. Fires, floods, pollution, infrastructure and transportation issues are still more than enough to keep players challenged and fully engaged though, so overall its not really a major concern.The Good:========+  Solid graphics and rich detail+  Realistic simulation elements+  Challenging gameplay with various difficulty settings+  Variety of buildings+  Many customization options+  Easy-to-use UI+  Extremely high replay value+  Mod-friendly with editting tools included+  Steam Trading Cards & Achievements+  Pleasant audio/background musicThe Bad:======-  Lack of random events/natural disasters-  Graphics could be more life-like-  Terrain cannot be changed during actual gameplayFinal Thoughts:===========Cities Skylines is the best City Building simulation developed in a long time and quite possibly the best ever. Expect this game to continue to grow in popularity and become the new industry standard for games of this type. An amazing game with well-designed features integrated into it for such a small development team and a limited budget. Its definitely worth the price and I highly recommend this game to all fans of simulated strategy/cty building games.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

Pros++Very accessible to new players, but has enough depth to satisfy veterans of the genre++Each citizen has a real life, simulated 24/7 to the point where you can follow everyone around to find exactly where they live and where they work. +Huge cities with 36 square kilometer area for building, expandable through mods to 100 square kilometers +Runs well on my GTX 770 and i5 3.8ghz CPU on max settings+Day 1 modding and Steam works integration+Custom ingame asset and map editorsCons--No day or night cycle, meaning no rush hours or changes in traffic patterns-Lack of depth in a few of the systems (wind and crime specifically)-Dams are buggy, can cause massive unnatural flooding if they stop working correctly. -Bigger cities can reduce performance -Building styles are repetitive, often times 3 or more of the same store or house end up being built next to each otherIf you like city builders, this is honestly the best one to come out in years. Cities: Skylines allows you to easily build huge cities without restriction that truly feel alive with the real time simulation of ALL the citizens. Rename and customize everything, even custom buildings and maps can be created in the in game editors included. And with a very fair $30 price tag, there is honestly no reason outside of a few minor bugs to not play Cities: Skylines.			"

												This really is the greatest city simulator there is, and will be for quite a long time. I'm having trouble finding ANYthing wrong with this game. I've played most SimCity's, Anno 2070, Cities XL and almost fell for the Cities XXL nonsense. Then I found this game, and my life is complete.Some of the things worth noting:- The UI is simple but intuitive, it doesn't have that featureless feeling some of the plainer UI's have.- The game itself runs incredibly well, however you do need a good processor and a few GB of RAM to play it idealy.- Gameplay is silky smooth and addicting, no glitches or anything. There's even a little in-engine physics to things like cars, rivers and trees.- Road design is incredibly free and grid layouts are 100% accurate, unlike 2013's Simcity.- Full workshop and in-game modding support with an expanding community and many interesting items and maps to choose from, Copper Creek on the workshop is my favorite.- This list just goes on and on...The only thing I can really notice being undesirable (to a small extent, it's not really a big deal) are things like garbage and deathcare. They tend to get overwhelming and lots of weekly money needs to be spent to fix them. (When your landfills are full or more people are dying than you can transport to a cemetary kind of thing) I'd recommend finding something better on the workshop or using the asset editor to lower/raise some gampleay values in those buildings slightly.Just a fair little heads up to newcomers, your citizens in this game are born, age, and die eventually. Don't worry though, they'll be replaced by their children for the largest part. But there may be a point in the game where a lot of people suddenly die and it's a little scary. This is because of your senior citizens getting a little too old. if you know what I mean. Be sure to prepare for this if you find it to happen, I am not completely certtain if it's just that playrhrough of mine of if it's actually a phenomenon within the game.   :PTo sum it up and make it nice and short for you, this game really is a worthwhile investment and it honestly, coming from someone who's a dear city-builder fan, steps on all the other titles and I mean ALL of them. You'll love it.Find my review helpful? Have anything to say or any constructive criticism to give? No problem! Let me know!			"

												Cities: Skylines is a City Builder/Simulation game, and it’s fantastic.Cities: Skylines absolutely destroys EA and Maxis’ 2013 effort, Sim City, in every conceivable way.  Where Maxis managed to somehow fail in a genre they pretty much invented, Colossal Games and Paradox Interactive have treated Maxis’ effort as a treatise on what not to do.This is, without a doubt, the game Sim City 2013 should have been.First up, the graphics. Skylines is very well optimized, with large detailed cities bustling along with no hiccups, and some nice options in the settings to fiddle with if you do experience any problems. The game looks great, with lots of detail. Buildings grow and “level up” as you watch, changing their value and appearance and attracting different types of people and businesses. You can easily identify different areas and specialties, as well as transport, power and sewerage systems by colour using the (mostly) intuitive UI. Clicking on people, houses and buildings will give you more details, and identifying problems (or successes) is made very easy.The gameplay is where Skylines shines, however. You’ll be juggling residents needs and wants by ensuring access to clean water, power, efficient transportation, entertainment and medicine, to name just a few. You’ll have to control pollution, both physical and noise, crime and disease. There are a variety of ways to do this, how you go about it is up to you.You’ll start by placing roads. Then zone areas off the roads into a category: Residential, Industrial, Retail and Office. Then set up a functioning power grid and clean water/waste water sewerage system. After that, it’s all about placing public services to attract more people, and expanding your city across the map. And what a map! You initially start on each map with a 2 square kilometre parcel of land in which to build, but can expand out over 8 such parcels out of 25 available per map. That said, it is trivial to mod out the limitation, and if your computer can handle it, you absolutely can build on the entire map. As a bonus, if you don’t like any of the premade maps the game ships with, you can easily use the in-game map editor to create (or recreate!) your own map to play on. There is even an asset editor too, so you can create and modify the in game assets to your preferences.The game systems make sense, and work how you’d expect them to. This is a simulation game, after all! After you’ve finished zoning your city, you can then create districts, which allow you to apply policies city wide or just to select areas. Make the CBD have compulsory smoke detectors and free public transport, while giving the poor and destitute section of town a rebate on green energy. Ban heavy vehicles from residential areas to lower noise and decongest traffic!Industries will make you money, but require careful planning. Take advantage of natural oil reserves, mine ore, farm, cut down your forests or simply go for “Generic”, where you’ll be making random stuff. The finance and taxation system is easily understood and superb. The game models traffic behaviour very well and in fact figuring out a way to manage high density traffic is one of the hardest aspects of playing Skylines. To that end, you’re given plenty of options, such as numerous road types, public transport, cargo ships, trains and aeroplanes.Surprisingly, the game has an incredibly effective water simulation too; Dams will burst and water flows realistically throughout the map, and pollution will be carried downstream with currents.The icing on the cake for Cities: Skylines is the fact that Skylines is 100% mod friendly, with integrated Steam Workshop support. People have already uploaded thousands of custom maps and assets to the workshop, as well as gameplay tweaks and it’s pretty safe to say that if you find something wrong with the game that you think could be better, there is a very good chance that there is already a mod for it on the workshop.Now you’ve heard me gush over how great this game is, what are the cons?The game doesn’t auto-save! This is a real pain if you mess up. But, there is a mod for that.There is no day/night cycle, which would have been nice. But, there is a mod for that.The camera doesn’t let me go low enough to get a good look of my city streets up close. But, there is a mod for that. There is another one that enables a First Person View from and person you click on in the street!Not a lot of maps to choose to play on. But, the workshop has hundreds available, downloaded and added to the available maps with a single click.There is even a mod that allows you and a friend to explore your cities in First Person online, using the in game people as avatars. Why? Who knows! But it’s possible!In conclusion, if you like city builders or simulation games, you cannot go wrong with Cities: Skylines. It is everything you could want out of this genre.Sim City, eat your heart out.			"

Cities: SkylinesNote: Each field is weighted differently, and thus affects the overall score differently.  Field Rating Review   Graphics 8 The design in Skylines is certainly well thought out. A balance between looking good, and performing well. While not top of the line graphics, Skylines found a sweet medium between realism and cartoony that actually works rather well. It's not distracting in any way, and you wouldn't really notice until you zoomed in close to individual cars and people. The city feels alive and bustling, and the game still performs well at large simulation levels. The interface is very, very well thought out, along with each of the overlays. It is clear they are all heavily inspired by Sim City (the good ones), which isn't a bad thing. Why fix what isn't broke?    Gameplay 9.5 This is what city-builders have been waiting for, for a long time. Ever since Sim City 4, city building games have either performed poorly, or massively under-delivered gameplay wise. Skylines has come onto the field full force, and delivers a polished, seamless world to build in, with a gigantic area to boot. Manage your water lines, power, trash, health care, leisure, and more. Of particular note are the public transit routes, refined by the former Cities in Motion games. Also of mention is the small, but wonderful ability to create districts which allow you to section out portions of your city and assign each of them unique names and policies (no high-rises, less water use, etc). Skylines took plenty of notes from the old city builder games we all loved, and refined the experience into something absolutely wonderful. They've even included a mode to allow you to play with unlimited money, and everything unlocked, so you can build without worry and create the city you've always dreamed of! The only minor frustrations that have emerged are some struggles with boats and routes for roads, but that could be my lack of patience for getting down into the nitty-gritty details of layout.   Story N/A No story here, besides the one you mutter to yourself as you cut off your city's water supply.   Multiplayer N/A No multiplayer in Cities: Skylines.   Replayability 10 This nearly comes with the territory of city building games. They always call you back to try creating a different city, or try new ideas with your layout. Or perhaps unleash havoc on the city to just...see what happens. Take all that joy, polish it, and you have Cities: Skylines, at your beck and call.   Overall 9.6/10 If you have been waiting for a worthy successor to Sim City 4, you have just found it. With free content updates down the road, Steam Workshop support, and developer's that listen to their audience, Cities: Skylines has everything good going for it, and my does it sing its song well. From the refined interface, to the focus upon you having control over your city, to the sheer size of the cities you can create; Cities: Skylines delivers on every front, and is exactly the city-builder game you hoped it would be. Though it isn't revolutionary in any of its gameplay elements, it has risen to the challenge that was so long failed, and now carries the torch of the city-building genre. Highly recommended, now get out there and build the city you've always dreamed of, and be sure to stop by the Steam Workshop for some neat mods!

												I like this. Pros:+No EA.+Good performance.+No ""Always online"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.+Mod support.+Launch price is like 50-60% of normal full game price on launch.+Game takes up little HardDrive space (About 2-4 GB's). +Large build space (Composed of 2x2Km squares that can be unlocked, I have 8 at the moment, not sure of limit). (+mods to increase it further, at cost of performance) +A few unique mechanics (Like Districts), as well as good mechanics you'd expect.Cons:-Easy.-Lack of endgame content.-Looks like a Sim City clone. (Yet the ""clone"" is >2 times better...)TL;DR: Good. Get.			"

												My people complained because taxes were too high, so I placed the water pumping station right next to the water drain pipe so they were forced to drink their own urine and feces. Within minutes, 97% of the water was contaminated with their own poop and hospitals began to flood with sick people. I couldn't let that happen, so I bulldozed every medical clinic and hospital and replaced them with cemetaries so the citizens knew exactly what their future looked like. While more and more people got sick, the population continued to decrease by the thousands. It took no more than fifteen minutes before every citizen was dead. Every citizen except for one. While everyone else was in bed waiting to die, there was one lone garbage truck driver who was determined to do his duty to his country. He pushed through the sickness and feces and continued to collect trash from the empty houses. That man operating the garbage truck is a true hero. Even through the apocalypse, he continued to fight for this country and show the world he is truly the greatest garbage truck driver that ever lived. Shortly after, he drowned in his own ♥♥♥♥. RIP in peace Squidney Saxton, garbage man, 2015-2015.On the bright side, my traffic problem went away.			"

												For 2 weeks I debated purchasing Cities: Skylines (I'm sure I annoyed most of my friends by weighing the pros and cons with them!) Eventually I said, ""screw it"" and made the purchase: I have not regretted it since.In a nut shell, Cities: Skylines is your basic city simulator. You start off with a blank landscape and a highway off to the side, of which is the key to growing your sprawling city. Sounds very simple, yes? Well, not quite. Cities: Skylines goes beyond just throwing houses and shops together. You're required to check pollutants in the form of ground and noise, dissiptating clogged roadways, providing entertainment, and so much more. Essentially, this game is everything that you could ever ask for in a simulator.---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ Replayability value is here 100%+ Sound effects are great and very life-like+ The graphics, my oh my, the graphics - they are absolutely stunning; if you're able to play on high graphics, then go for it. The view is very rewarding and satisfying. Great job, Colossal!+ There is always something to look out for: budgeting, job and housing demands, etc. This game is definitely no joke. It demands your every attention and is not something you can just idle+ Related to the graphics point: I love how this game works so well on my non-gaming laptop. I have a Toshiba E45T which is not one by any means. This game is so well optimised, I can still enjoy it to its fullest though+ The ""basic"" version of Cities: Skylines offers a lot at a decent price. If your budget is fairly tight, then disregard the Deluxe Edition unless you really want 5 extra monuments (plus as a way to support the developer's further). You can always get the 5 extra monuments through the workshopNeutral± DLC's are a bit pricey and I'm not sure if it's really worth it. In the end, it's your call Update 26 May, 2016: I've finally gotten around to purchasing both DLC's and I'll provide a brief breakdown. After Dark DLC: comes with some new lanes and a couple edicts, leisure and tourism specializations (night clubs, etc.), and extra buildings. Some people are noting that it comes with a night and day cycle, but I was experiencing the cycle without the DLC... maybe I'm just confusing something!Snowfall DLC: snow, obviously, hah! Also snowmaps, snowplows and snowpiles, more edicts and heating systems. Verdict: In my opinion, the DLC's are not worth it at their full price. Yes, they serve to enhance gameplay and also act as a way for you to support the developer's as well. With the little amount of content that both of them offer, however, and at $12+ price tags, I'd say your money would be better spent elsewhere. So, either wait until the DLC's are cheaper (I'd say under $8 would be more appropriate), avoid the DLC's completely, or just splurge because you want to. If you're an achievement hunter like me, then you'll need to purchase the DLC's. If budget is an issue, then I would suggest getting After Dark first. It has been much more enjoyable due to it's far more superior offering of content. Quite frankly, I haven't even really played with Snowfall since it doesn't offer much beyond its name. It's completely up to you!Cons- Realistic traffic please! (There is a mod for this though)- Can there be an undo button? It would be extremely helpful- Connecting roads can be a real hassle at times, especially when you're looking to upgrade them- Would be very useful if we could just upgrade buildings for a fee, such as the Cargo Harbour to Hub (without having to go through the process of destroying it first)---------------------------------------------------------All in all, Cities: Skylines is honestly one of the best purchases I have ever made to date on Steam. I've already lost 22+ hours since my purchase 4 days ago, and it has left me impressed each time I've exited the game. If you're into simulators, I highly recommend this one - I hope it leaves as much of an impression on you as it has on me.With an abundance of content and a plethora of mods being developed (or already developed), you seriously can't go wrong with this title. Bravo, Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive, bravo: thank you for this amazing game.Overall9.5/10If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask - I will answer them to the best of my ability. On that note, cheers and happy building!---------------------------------------------------------Update 11 June, 2016: FREE STADIUM DLC! Thank you, Colossal Order - this game just gets better and better. You never fail to impress with the amount of dedication and love you have for your game.---------------------------------------------------------Worthy Questions & Answers1) Can this game be played offline (credits to ru): Yes, yes this game can be played offline! I've done around  7 hours of gameplay offline (due to power outages). That didn't stop me from getting on this game though!2) Does the game require a lot of attention (credits to ru): the great thing about this game is that, while it does require micromanagement, it doesn't necessarily need a lot. You can leave the game in order to run an errand if you choose. I've left it for around 10 minutes before - always came back to a 99% operational city (those dead bodies, yo. Keep piling up!)---------------------------------------------------------Like my review or have any questions? Then please consider joining my review group, the Sonny Report!

												Let's start with this: it is an amazing city building game. It's the best in generations. BUT, like any other game, it has it's downfalls too.MAP SIZE: 10/10The city size is HUGE. At first you start out in a 2kmx2km area, but you can expand to a total of 9 of them, for a 18x18km area or 324 km or 201 mi area. Another pluside is that there are already mods to expand your city size to a total of 25 tiles, for a 50x50 km area, 2500 km, or 1553 mi area. The size of this doesn't make your computer lag, either, unless you don't meet the minimum requirements for the game.AI: 7/10They all have diverse personalities, and you can explore the lives of each of them. The only problem is the traffic. It's terrible: If there all 6 lanes available, they will all go in one lane. Genius.INTERFACE: 9/10The interface is great. It is just a little cluttered.HOW IT RUNS: 10/10It runs extremley smooth and only starts to lag when you have HUGE cities. For an example, watch this video:

			All credit goes to the creators of these cities :) Like, comment, and subscribe for more!		

THINGS TO DO: 9/10There is a LOT to do, from perfecting neighborhoods to fixing water pipes. The only reason I knocked 1 point off is because there are no disasters, which in my opinion is something required for a city building game.DIVERSITY: 9/10The only reason it is 9/10 is because the building colors are almost identical and painted-looking. Despite this, you can model your own buildings :)DIFFICULTY: (not how hard the game is) 9/10The only reason it is difficult is when you get to huge cities it becomes literally difficult with everything in your face all at once.GRAPHICS: (for the average graphics of the time of the release date) 9/10They are amazing. I've seen better, but it is still great. It has it's own style.CLUTTER: 8/10Ugh, when your in a city trying to build, pop ups everywhere makes it hard to work..PRICE: 10/10For this great of a game, it is very cheap at the time of it's release.OVERALL SCORE:90% To PerfectWould I recommend this? Yes!			"

			Finally, a promising contender for SimCity's city-building crown. Is it any good? How does it compare to its predecessors? Find out in this review!		

If you’ve longed for another great city-builder like I have, or simply want to try one for the first time, I don’t hesitate at all in saying Cities Skylines is a superb choice.Skylines is a proper old school city-builder. As a SimCity player since the 1989 original, I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this thing. I’ve spent about 40 hours on it so far, so the question is: does it succeed in its goal of topping SimCity? Well, in a word, YES.As is tradition, you start with a blank plot of land and a set of tools at your disposal. Generally the goal is to build a city, grow it as big as you like, and make sure it doesn’t die. You have a single highway connection to start out with, which acts as the first of many entrances to your city. Use the road tools to draw some roads, and you’ll see that you get groups of tiles extending from the side of them. These tiles can be filled with three types of zones: residential, commercial, and industrial, which will become homes, shops, and factories. Although more come into play later on, like high-density residential and commercial zones, as well as office zones, the central system of RCI demand is very much in play here. The more demand for a zone you have, the more people will move in to fill those zones and the more service buildings you'll require, so you’ll want to balance their placement with the other needs of the city. Beyond these basics, it’s totally up to you as to what’s next.And thankfully you’re not limited to your initial map size. That starting plot of land is 2 square kilometers, but once you start reaching its borders, you have the option to buy more, up to 36 square miles worth (more if you mod the game with the excellent tile mod on Steam.) Although, sometimes the game gets a bit bogged down in ambiguities regarding its logic, mostly regarding traffic, services, and lack of UI information. But once I started to figure these systems out, the challenge in fixing them was hugely rewarding. Cities XXL and SimCity 5 were entirely too easy, and if you screwed those cities up, that was a real feat of ineptitude. Here, a doomed city can arise from something as simple as building an intersection instead of a multi-lane traffic circle, and that’s kind of awesome. But it doesn't feel cheap, it feels like something to learn from and perform better next time. There are also some included mods from the developers, which act as cheats and difficulty settings in lieu of more traditional menu options. And on top of that there's an incredible potential for user-made mods, with a full blessing from the developer to do so with the included Steam Workshop support.Let me just say it: This is the game I’ve been craving since SimCity 4. My few complaints are just drops in a sea of truly satisfying gameplay. It’s the kind of game that I can play for so many hours at a time that when I leave, I start seeing zone layouts in my ceiling, and traffic patterns in my cereal. Just give me a pot of coffee and watch me while away dozens of hours creating the perfect balance of land value, city services, and mass transit systems and be completely content. It’s blissful, stressful, and compelling on a level that few games ever achieve for me anymore. There are so many details that I love, like the way you can paint zones with different brushes, the sweeping orchestral soundtrack, the guidelines that appear when placing roads, the fact you can flood your city if you dam a river improperly, the way any zone has buildings that fit into any plot shape, and on and on.And it runs great too, even when surpassing 100,000 citizens, it still played solidly with minimal frame rate issues on both my desktop and laptop. Colossal Order pulled off a true colossal order here: they made a better SimCity than Maxis could (requiescat in pace.) And all this with a comparatively small budget, a team of a dozen or so people, and the Unity Engine. Just... wow. Cities Skylines is a total slap in the face to SimCity 5, and man is it a beautiful thing to behold. And the price... you get twice the game at half the price of its rival's launch price. Folks, this is what I like to call “doing it right”. They could’ve charged double and I still would recommend it, but wow. This is a top-notch game at a bargain launch price, and it makes me want to cry tears of joy.			"

Q: What I think of this game?A: Best city builder game I played... ever... periodQ: What I don’t like about it?A: Traffic does need to be fine tuned, and I feel mods are necessary to balance the game, but it's very tedious...Q: What about user generated content?A: Workshop community has been very impressive, adding so many cool things to the game. I am at a point where I feel I am missing out on amazing mods and content, because there are so many to choose from, and I can't invest the time to try them all. But how can you really complain from having too much choice, so forget I just said that...Q: Does it worth the price?A: Price might seem a bit steep to some, but for any fan of city builder games, you'll get your money's worth in the first week... and probably lose a bit of grasp on reality at the same time. Bottom line, you will get a lot more then what you pay for, so why wait?Q: What I would love to see added to the game?A: I would like to see some scenarios of some kind being added. Milestones are great, and sandbox opens so many possibilities... yet still, I would like to have the option of being guided or limited to specific objectives.It would help me understand some parts of the game better, and bring my game to another level.Q: What are my advices when playing the game?A: The game expects you to be a pro at this; you'll have to make a lot of mistakes before you find your way.It's easy to ""cheat"" the game, but it will not make it more fun. - Watch tutorials to get some ideas - Use mods with caution, they can improve the game, but can also break it... - Help rating user generated content, rating takes 5 seconds and creators should get recognition for their work- Make suggestions, Colossal Order and Paradox are listening to the feedback and are not wasting any timeQ: What would I like to say to Paradox and Colossal Order’s team?A: You have given me what I was waiting for! THANK YOU! But you have also stolen 100 hours of my life already... Are you proud?     I am sure you are ;) You’ve set new standards in the way a game should be delivered to the community and updated based on user feedback, and all gamers will benefit from your work. Kudos to everyone!!!Q: Where am I going?A: Sorry, I have a city to build... goodbye!			"

												Cities: Skylines is a city builder developed by Colossal Order, the guys who were responsible for making the Cities in Motion series, and published by Paradox Interactive, and I have to say this is hands down the best city builder we’ve ever had on Steam .The size of the game is astonishing, by default the game features a 36km^2 map which is almost ten times the size of the map we’re given in SimCity 2013, and with the help of mods from the Steam Workshop, this can be expanded to a mind boggling 100km^2. Even though there are no interactions between cities that are on different maps, it is frankly not necessary, with the help of the powerful yet easy to use building tool, you can build multiple cities on a single map.Despite its humongous size, the developers paid close attention to details, in fact, detail is the word I’ll use to describe this game. From the entire traffic network, down to individual citizens, every aspect in Cities: Skylines are properly simulated. You’ll find lorries, colour coded depending on what they are currently carrying, delivering their cargoes to their designated factories, citizen actually living in a permanent home, and ambulances rushing to accident scenes, then little paramedics will get out of their vehicle, and few seconds later return with a patient on a stretcher. I also love how water works in this game as well as the fluid physics, it is completely unnecessary to have it in a city builder but in this case it has added so much more to the experience. Water has currents and flows, so you'll want to pump water on the upstream and set up sewage pipes on the opposite end, else you’ll start pumping polluted sewage water back into the system. You can even drain a lake dry completely, or accidentally flooding your city because you demolished a dam, playing with water has never been so fun. This is a city builder perfected, and with the support of Steam Workshop, further enriched by the endless creativity of the community. Cities: Skylines is a must buy for anyone who has the slightest interest in city builders.			"

												Hi guys! This is Pablo, from SimNation.Cities: Skylines goes back to the core City Builder experience of SimCity 2000, 3000, 4... and improves on it.Simulation is epic. Each citizen is simulated, with own age, workplace, home, household, education level and happines. They can even own cars. And all of this is persistent. All of them are living in your city until the day they die out of sickness or when their time comes.Traffic and Public transportation is properly executed as well. Heck, even water is simulated with the Fluid simulation. I think we all have seen the dams and the poop flowing by a river at the expected speed and direction.The economic system is awesome. RCI is meaningful. Commerces import goods from the exterior, or local industries if available. Citizens must purchase different kind of goods to be happy. And all of this is executed, and you can get down to street level and see it for yourself.Building a city on Cities: Skylines is this long, epic journey, where you will be laying out the city infrastructure through proper city planning and engineering (the game will punish you for not making road access or dispose your sewage properly), dealing with Noise Pollution, dead body collection, and all with the right level of micro management to make you feel you are in charge. From laying down the routes of buses or metros, to defining Districts and setting unique Policies to change the way it behaves, or help a sector get back on it's feet by lowering taxes or making public transportation free.Despite the lack of polishing of many aspects of the game, from user feedback, to user interface and lack of content variety (chirps, buildings, billboards), you are not going to focus too hard on it because of all the other things the game gets right.If you like city builders, this is hands down a safe purchase. A game that will most likely be supported for years, with an insanely amount of Mods and great deal of free patches to come, which will hopefully fix those rough edges from day 1.			"

												Not owned by EA.What more is there to say?10/10------------------------------------------------------------------Edit : This is truly the best city simulation games no doubt. But the most annoying problem is it's traffic I guess. Sometimes, they prefer to go 1 lane than using all the lane that are available and caused the traffic jams. And also the death waves occur when you plot a big area of residential at once. http://imgur.com/gallery/5xz1CYa  What happen is they will die simultaneously as they have the same age and the hearse cannot pickup all the dead body at once and most of the citizen will abandon your city. So you need to build your city slowly and not plotting huge area of residential at once. Other than that, it is a good game and I really enjoyed playing this. Some of the mods are fun and helpful and they are easy to configure. If you are a new Cities Skylin-er, I will recommend you these mods : https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/3c5sku/been_seeing_questions_from_new_users_on_essential/ "

												This is the game awaited by the city building community for 12 years, a proper, full 3D successor to SimCity 4. It is incredibly fun, insanely addictive and somewhat challenging, although it has some minor drawbacks.Pros:+ It is so addictive I spent 36 hours playing it in the first three days after I got it+ Transportation system is very detailed, and agent-based simulation works very nicely with it+ Zoning works very nicely with free-form roads+ The available territory is quite big - up to 36 square kilometers in base game (9 tiles), up to 100 square kilometers with a simple mod (25 tiles) and whopping 324 (!) square kilometers with the less stable 81 tile enabler+ Unique and fully working fluid dynamics system+ Districts and policies allow for fine control over your city+ Globally unlocked buildings help to vary playstyle in different cities - from building an eco-friendly utopia with lots of parks and low taxes to an industrial hellhole full of illness and crime+ Modding is quite encouraged - the community is very active and the tools are easy to use; by now there are hundreds of great mods and assets avalable on the Workshop+ Dev team keeps in touch with the community and pays a lot of attention to the feedback+ Free patches significantly improve the game, introducing great features like tunnels, European themed buildings, day-night cycle, in-game terraforming, canals and quays, increased object limits and improved mod toolsCons:- It's not very challenging past the first 10k - the biggest hurdles left are traffic and congestion (there are numerous mods rebalancing the game to be harder more realistic, but I can't vouch for their quality)- The amount of assets included in the base game is relatively small (but bigger than on release), so you'll see a lot of repetition (although it is remedied by mods and community-created assets, you have to keep an eye on RAM and VRAM consumption)- Day/night cycle doesn't really make much of a difference in vanilla gameplay (again, there's an excellent mod which overhauls the mechanic - Rush Hour)All in all, Cities: Skylines is an amazing game that's certainly worth a purchase, especially with its low price. But you may not enjoy it as much if you are not a fan of the genre.			"

												Cities Skylines looks to bring back the classic city building genre to it's roots. Avoiding the mistakes made by EAs most recent Sim City release, Skylines does without an always online connection, supports large building areas and user created mods.And while avoiding these pitfalls, Collosal Order and Paradox have also made a very addictive and entertaining game.  You can easily lose hours making sure your bus routes are optimized and your fire departments can get to that shack down the road that keeps burning down.The UI is clear and easy to navigate, building roads and designating zones for construction is simple, yet requires some careful planning if you want to make the ""best"" city possible. There are many tools and overlays available for viewing crime, water quality, power consumption, etc. Economy isn't overtly deep, simple sliders for taxes, and options for different policies.  For those wanting to go deeper, you can rename every citizen, vehicle, building, create districts, individually manage them, alter bus routes, and plenty more for the mayor that wants to really get down to street level.Planning traffic routes is of prime importance in this game. Industry needs to move products, emergency services need to get to calls, and dead people need to be removed from their homes. More so than pretty much anything, you need to keep your eye on this. This isn't surprsing given the developer's history with Cities in Motion (despite being a Paradox game with a similiar name, this isn't part of the Cities XL series). Graphics look good for the genre (don't expect GTA V detailed cities), and everything is running smooth for me at a population of 45k as of this writing. The sounds are what you'd expect, nothing really stands out, and it's not annoying, fairly average. While the variety of options in the game is plenty, there are still some things I'm sure some people will miss from other city building games. No day or night cycle kind of spoiled my desire to see my city lit up at night. There could be a bit more variety in buildings, and public services (libraries, museums, prisons, zoos and some other notable buildings all appear to be absent). I'm sure modders will fill in this gap given some time, but I wouldn't mind paying for a hefty expansion if they decided to release more content in the future.PS: Kill Chirpy.			"

Cities: Skylines is a city building simulator. Build a city from the grounds up, managing the budget and city services for a population that is increasingly demanding as it grows. This review takes into account the After Dark DLC (will update review as I acquire and play with further DLCs).Pros: The game looks great with intricate models and gorgeous night-time lighting effects. The tutorial is built into the game with help cards that explain each game concepts when accessing them for the first time. These concepts are gradually introduced upon reaching certain population thresholds, which makes sense: a 1000-citizen town doesn't need a university or a subway line, so you don't get city approval to build these until the population mendates it. Colossal Order's experience with Cities in Motion shines through the complex, but not complicated, public transport system, down to bus routes, cab depots and international airports. City budget is simple with scroll-bars for taxes and service expense, and various city-wide or district-specific policies ranging from Smoking Ban for a better city health to Legalized Marijuana for bonus tourism. Money is inflated just well enough, as either something's wrong with your city and you're losing a lot of money, or you fixed what's wrong and you're making a lot of money, preventing you from spending an eternity waiting for your money to go up a few dollars at a time (unlike some other city builder I know) or needing to change the game speed in an attempt to skip the wait. Statistics and graph tools are impeccable, you just pick category from the graphs menu or a building from your build menu, and you get stats, capacity, street coverage and building needs right in the city view.Cons: You are limited to a starting map and may gradually purchase more land, and while the concept makes sense in tycoon-style games, you can unlock most land expansions pretty early and their cost is pretty low, so it feels like a cheap way to force you into starting at a particular location when you wish you could start you city elsewhere on the map. There are some weird oversights in the graphics, such as large ships that literally pass through bridges, or trees that grew under water (leaves and all). Building long roads or pipes in a straight line is also sketchy: I regularly had roads built in parallel still have the space between them shrink over distance, or have the hardest time getting both directions of a highway aligned in curves. I mean, I'm all for it when it comes to not being locked into an isometric grid, but it should allow you to build straight when you want to. Ironically, buildings and land tiles, which you may want to customize, actually ARE locked in a grid along the road. Even with a dozen alternate routes, every single car (including emergency vehicules) use the shortest road regardless on traffic jams, a problem that only gets worst as the city grows.Verdict: ★★★★★ - Play this. Now.The Cons may appear lengthy, but it's only because these were minor gripes that required explanation to even grasp why they are gripes. Cities: Skylines is the best city builder out there, bringing everything that was fun about SimCity 4 – Deluxe Edition, equaling or surpassing most innovations SimCity ""5"" brought, and adding so much of its own. If you like city simulators at all, this one is a must have. I can't wait to experience the Snowfall DLC's new weather conditions and city services, as well as the upcoming Natural Disasters DLC that'll give it the only things left SimFans can still brag about.P.S.: I haven't mentioned the Mods available through the Steam Workshop, but I just have to point out Bryan Shannon, a former Maxis artist who does professional-quality building Mods for Cities: Skylines. If you have any interest in downloading Mods for this game, you should browse his collection.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

This is the City Builder of my Dreams!If you're unsure if you want this game because other City Builders put you off...Trust me, I've played them all and this one is by far the best!Things I really like:- Buying surrounding land, the starter map isn't overwhelming.- Map / Item Editors... - Customisation makes any game better.- The launch price isn't greedy...- The graphics are beautiful and the game is amazingly optimised!- Little animations such as ambulances, fire engines etc. add that character to the game.- Workshop support!.. The developers fully support Modders! :D- Right-Hand Drive option - This makes it more realistic to me...Things I don't like:- The roads are good but they can be a little awkward to place every so often.- Placing pipelines.. I rather this just be auto-added under streets- The Unlock system is good but things like Taxes or Public Transport shouldn't be Locked.- Doesn't seem to work on triple monitors... The game loads but you can't click ""Continue"" or ""New"".I'd Recommend this game to anyone who Enjoys Building games or Simulators. 10/10There's a few really minor issues but overall this is the best game of its sub-genre.Another game that makes me happy to own a Computer!

												I started with city builders way back in 1996, with SimCity 2000, beginning the construction of my ""capital of capitals"" - I was nine, I nerded out, made it a capital of an empire I created for myself, heh. For the permanently angled view, the constant reticulation of splines, and the occasional metal monster blowing up my forests of arcologies and massacring millions of my citizens as a result, there was enough to it to make the imagination to go wild. SC3K (and 3K Unlimited/World Edition) was the same basic idea with a lot more detail, and SC4 allowed me to build bigger and bigger (Rush Hour was a neat touch too, because you could actually into the streets - not quite like Streets of SimCity, but close enough). Even Societies, which gets a bad rap because it's not Maxis - among other reasons - worked out great - perhaps even better, as your decisions on the society effected the decor quite nicely. (I tended to build Authoritarian cities, heh heh.)Then came SimCity 2013, and it seemed like a good idea to start. Except for the constant online feature, the DRM controversies, so on...and the fact that the city sizes were fixed, as opposed to the variously-sized tiles made available in SC4. It basically turned into another typical EA game - ""buy more of this, it will enhance the experience"". I was disappointed...Cities of Tomorrow was an interesting touch, but not enough to keep me going.Then I heard about Cities: Skylines. A number of people suggested the similar-yet-unrelated Cities XL (and various sequels) to me in lieu of SC '13, and when this came out, some pointed me here. I got it during the last sale about a month ago, and began building a new incarnation of my capital of capitals...and for the first time in twenty years, it felt like a real city, with real needs. I was used to the basic stuff, mainstays of most city-builders of this type - needs power, water, garbage disposal, police, so on - but in my first playthrough, I looked in the healthcare tab and went, ""Wait...cemeteries? You have DEATHCARE in this game?"" Which was kinda funny to me, as in real life, I like to explore historic cemeteries...the thought never occurred to me that maybe there could be historical cemeteries in my own cities!The unique buildings and monuments are also a nice touch, because they're functional as well as decorative (I have them all except for the fusion plant, I need the observatory). The weather is also nice; I will have to get the Snowfall pack to see how well I can build in the snow...if it's anything like New England winter, probably not too well!While there is still a size limit (barring the use of mods) for your city, it's a lot larger than in SC '13, and also has a lot more flexibility than SC '13...or any other type of game like this I've played, for that matter. And the realistic details allowed me to fool my friends and family; my brother had actually thought a screencap of my city was a photograph of a real city.In short: Loads of fun, and it's induced me to commit heresy against the Church of SimCity by building here...any fans of the golden oldies, please don't burn me at the stake.

												This game is comparable to Simcity 4 but with better graphics and gameplay. A whole lot better when compared to the latest simcity which is plagued with many problems such as map size and DRM.Pros:- Realistic water simulation; if you build your water intake down the river and the waste output up the river, you're gonna feed your citizens with poop water. And dams will alter the flow of the river- Noise pollution is taken into consideration (Can be caused by traffic, windmills, industries etc.). - District zoning (allows you to micro-manage your city easily). Policies can be introduced only to the specific districts. For example, in district 1 it is legal to use recreational drugs while in district 2 it is illegal.- Easily accesable info view where you can see the stats of your city, such as education, crimes, and so on.- Natural resource exploitation for more income.- Detailed public transportation systems which allows you to plan the routes.- Very easy to learn especially if you have played city building games such as Simcity before.- You are able to see the complaints of your citizens in a notification box above the screen which functions like twitter. This allows you to pinpoint and correct problems quickly.- Very big map sizes allows you to build metropolitan cities.- Limited service buildings are available at first but becomes available as your city grows (makes it easy for new players to learn)Cons:- Road mapping can get wonky sometimes and you end up building roads that are slanted. This kinda irritate the OCD side of me.- The unavailability of service buildings early in the game means that it is harder to plan your city early on. And you might have to sacrifice a couple of houses to accomodate the buildings.I will continue to update my review as I put more hours into this game. Feel free to comment on your opinions.			"

												Colossal Order, Paradox, and Steam Workshop:I want to thank you all for a fabulous game!I've played SimCity since its very first release and it was always, up until it's last disappointing release, my all time favorite computer game. Now, looking back it's as if SimCity is the game one plays in childhood (even though I was very much an adult in '89 lol), but as an adult you move up to the real thing. Which is clearly... Cities:Skylines! Its a grand city building game to be sure. And Steam Workshop ability moves it into a whole other realm. This game has inspired me to buy and begin the study of books on city planning, urban renewal, city design, environmental impact, traffic patterns, and how people drive and why. And I'm loving it! Every new chapter I read inspires me to revisit what I've already built in Cities to find ways to make it a better and happier city for my virtual population. And the tools I need to widen this experience are there for the using tucked nicely into a brilliant computer game. I'm having so much fun! :DDo I recommend this game? :D  Unreservedly and with happy enthusiasm.			"

Skylines is missing three things that I would love to see. Disasters: No not zombies or monster attacks... Disasters..a weather dynamic system such as rain, snow, tornadoes, hurricanes, monsoons, mudslides, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods and volcanic eruptions. Also economic and human disasters would be awesome..i.e WWIII breaks out and the fights come to your city due to its important economic means and its military baseElections and Council: Have a mode or option where you to put your record and city building skills on table and run against an opponent who may take your mayor position away. Also allow the option of adding a city council that can help or hamper your city planning by blocking or giving out city resources and land.Major Company HQ's, Sporting Events/teams and world events: Let us negotiate deals with major companies to build hq's in the city which may require tearing down a popular city spot. Let us bid for the olympics  then have to build the buildings should we win the bid! Or bid for major sports teams from all the major leagues of the world then negotiating new stadiums for said team. World events such as a Worlds Fair, or Papal Visit, or other major world events. That's my three wishes. Maybe a developer will see at least one ;) "

Cities: SkylinesDeveloper: Colossal Order LTDPublisher: Paradox InteractiveIntroduction==========I've never been particularly great at city building games, though I have been sort of playing them since the old Sim City 2000. Actually in that one I spent more time loading up scenarios and dropping various disasters on the city than playing...but still. There were very few offerings in this genre apart from Sim City, but then Cities: Skylines happened, and suddenly Sim City wasn't top dog anymore. Some will argue that Cities is better in every way.Gameplay==========As city builders go, Cities: Skylines is pretty simple. New players might be a little confused in the beginning, just as I was. I was so used to the Sim City UI and flow. First you need to setup roads, then zone the areas beside them. Residential, Commercial, Industrial, etc. Hook up power, water, and sewage, then watch as buildings start to pop up and people start to move in. As your population rises, new features, monuments, and buildings become available. There are tons of options for setting up your city, such as different kinds of roads, buildings leveling up, the ability to rename literally everything, and terrain redesign. As long as the basic needs are met, your city can thrive, but obviously some configurations and setups are better than others. How efficently things run is entirely up to you and how you plan out your city. You can freely manipulate the passage of time, by pausing it or speeding it up by 3 different levels. There is a nice option to have unlimited funds if you don't feel like being constrained by anything or just want to test out different layouts on a different save. Planning is probably the most important step of setting up a city, and finances is part of that. If you aren't particularly great at finances, the unlimited money option will be your best friend. It's recommended to pause the game right away when you first get started and make sure you go through the in-game tutorial prompts.Oh, one little tiny extra detail that may make or break your purchase decision: STEAM WORKSHOP SUPPORT. MODS. Enough said!Graphics==========This game is absolutely gorgeous. Every tiny detail is amazing. Once you get your city setup, zoom in and check it out from time to time, especially when you get some skyscrapers or monuments set up, or at night during the hustle and bustle. This game will provide you with some amazing screenshots for your Steam profile showcase! Pure eye candy all around.Sound and Music==========Cities: Skylines has a very relaxing soundtrack. Perfect for long or short sessions. When zoomed in enough, you'll also hear your citizens as they go about their daily lives. Car horns honk during busy traffic times, and of course there's the bustle of the industrial zones. Nothing was left out here. It's completely possible to get pretty immersed into your city, in every aspect.Performance==========The game runs wonderfully, I didn't experience a single problem even on the highest settings. Stable framerates, no lag, no stuttering. Mouse control is highly recommended. I'm not even sure a controller works, I didn't try. Might do it next time I play and update this, just for those who enjoy controller supported games.Final Thoughts==========What a wonderful game! Whether you enjoy city builders already or are looking to get into them, Cities: Skylines is a great title to introduce you to the genre or keep veterans occupied. With a couple of DLCs available, and of course all the mods currently out, you'll have plenty to keep you busy managing your city for dozens or even hundreds of hours. A great buy for sure.Gameplay Demo==========

												When starting off Cities Skylines I thought that the game would be another typical city builder with a mere simcity interface slap on it. The game proven that it has done many thing right the first time its come out and exceeded what sim city was however there is more work needed for the game especially in terms of the end game content. Overall the game itself is an exceptional city builder that everyone has to play if you enjoy this genre.

			My cities Skyline review, I spent over 20 hours playing and building cities.You can listen to why I loved this game but at the same time got bored with it, also steam review is up.		

 Pros + Runs really well and is decently optimized, even with a bigger city depending on your rig the game would still run really smooth (Window 7 64 bit from my end)+ The interface is straight from sim city so those with experience knows how to jump into the game with ease. Easy enough for new players to  understand and complex enough even for the hard edge veterans.+ The cities goes looks fantastic with modded material and district creation, the area changes on its look depending on what type of police you set in place. + The traffic system, water, and power system all works in this game right from the start in the game creating less stress to the player( WOW!)+ The district systems lets you color out zones and implement polices for the game giving you the option to create bans on certain things such as pets or smoking ban and creating unique distrits throughout your city+ Easy to use tax system and system to use for + Bigger map sizes for building. I had a Simcity complex where I would build in the small square a while taking up as much room as I can and being efficient as possible. It was easy enough to maintain a city and then expanding. Once expanding the city gets bigger and bigger and looks amazing.+Mod support on day one players are able to download others maps, building objects etc through steam workshop. The editor is also very easy to use and import/export material in to work with. Cons (Or things that Cities Skyline needs to add)- The game lacks depth and challenge for end game content. I find the game is easy and even on hard mode( which I play on) it was pretty easy if one knows how to balance out efficiency and building his city.  In the end you will make a ton of money and just basically start plopping amazingly huge cities without a clear goal. There isn't any concept of material needs for the game to improve the lives of the people of the city (Which sim city had) to give it that extra depth.- The snap for placing road sometimes can be a bit wonky and needs a bit more work. There isn't a city preplanning tool to help you preplan and no rewind button. Once ya place it you delete it and replace it etc.- No dynamic day/night cycle and disasters. These two are important function because seeing your city glow in the night is simply amazing and having disasters give you a sort of thrill in when it does occur. Without it the game doesn't offer much of a challenge unless you mess up your electrical/water or one of the needs of necessity in which case you create a disaster from it. - The npcs are not that entertaining to watch since they do not adhere to a day and night cycle rule. Therefore they aren't as robust and dynamic if one actually follows them for a for a few.- No multiplay ( Don't know if this will ever come true in the future)- Blurry graphic at times at highest settings, turn down shift helps a bit and a bit of film grain is added to the game.

												Cities: Skylines is a brand new city-building game in the vein of Simcity but built with modern sensibilities.What is Great about this game:- The city-building simulation is deep, complex, and incredibly satisfying to master- The agent and traffic simulation is particularly deep and compelling to manage- A variety of tools are available to manage almost any problem that arises in your city- The game looks and runs beautifully- Available areas for expansion are massive (and truly huge with easy to acquire mods)- Modding and Steam Workshop support is pervasive in the game, and the modding community is prolificWhat is Good about this game:- Good use of Steam features (cloud saves, trading cards, achievements, etc)What is Bad about this game:- Some of the mechanics of the simulation (e.g. freight train depots, RCI) are not well surfaced so it can be a challenge to know how to answer certain problemsConclusion:Cities: Skylines is the new benchmark in city building and city simulation games.  This is the game to get if you are at all interested in the genre, and everyone should at least try it once.10.0 / 10.0			"

												With After Dark released, I can finally make a legit review for Cities: Skylines.Cities is the most polished, realistic, best city building game I have ever played. Coming from early SimCity games and then to Cities XL, I can say that C:SL is a very, very recommended game that I will always recommend to any person interested in these games. I love city builders, and C:SL was amazing from the start. Many features include budget management, detailed transportation info, and many options on roads and how you want to build your city. You can expand your city limits and make your city thrive. With very little bugs and massive modding support, this game is the best of the best. Cities After Dark has made it so much better, with activity in your city slowing down (which in turn makes your economy slow down at night, adding a new challenge to the game), as night progresses. Some parts in your districts can be set to accomidate night life to make even more money to compensate for the lost revenue. Taxi services, train lines, bus lines, and subways are options for public transportation. Water and electricity management are vital to survive as a municipality. I love Cities: Skylines!			"

												Whats good -HUGE Playable area versus Simcity 2013Workshop = Endless modability Even without buying the DLC, you still get some stuff every DLC releaseWhat's not so good -Resource hog ; you need a NASA computer to run this on all highNo disasters or random eventsTraffic is at rush hour all day everyday without modsThe last DLC (Snowfall) includes some good stuff, but the main crux is merely vanity and only useable in new games (again, without mods)If you loved SimCity 4 and are yearning for a modern remake that's not SimCity 2013, this is a good attempt to revive the series. Beware that you'll *need* a few of the mods/workshop to really make the game shine.Free badges!			"

												Do you like creation, or city building? If yes to either, give this game a long look. The  two primary ways (soon to be three with the release of scenarios as part of the free update for the Disasters DLC) you'll probably play this game will be either sandboxing with infinite money, or more vanilla which won't use mods. What I love:Scale - The maps are massive. Even in vanilla in which you have access to 9 tiles out of a possible 81, you have a massive space to develop, decorate and grow. As a point of reference, Sim City 2013 maximum city space is equal to 1 square in Cities: Skylines. As a bonus, there are thousands of player created maps in the steam workshop, some of which provide fantastic settings to grow an empire or a small rural city. Living Cities - The people and the traffic all have a life, a destination; they're not simply arbitrary numbers detailing their supposed existence. You will be tasked to provide the infrastructure they need to live and will be critical to succeed as mayor, civil engineer, and accountant of your city.  Cities: Traffic Wars - Some love it, some hate it. I love traffic wars. I love the problem solving, the beautification designing of interchanges; it's a very rewarding feeling when you solve traffic problems successfully. Nothing wrong with that. Yes, there is quirky behavior, but it doesn't detract massively from the experience. I have a couple tips: Leave space for traffic to filter and minimize weaving. That goes a long way. There are player guides that tackle how to solve typical traffic issues such as How to Traffic and even guides that look at traffic flow theory and how it applies to this game. Workshop - Mod support and a massive amount of player content means there are enormous number of ways to build a city. Mods provide powerful options to take control, and build with massive freedom. Download responsibly and there will be minimal issues. You aren't limited to zoning and plopping, you can create beautiful, planned cities. The only limitation is your imagination.Not so great:DLC - A bit pricey for what you get, excluding After Dark. That dlc is excluded, and I would definitely take no issue paying full price on. Very feature rich. Unfortunately, the same level of praise is not really warranted for Snowfall. Trams and snow maps are nice, but I would not buy it full price. Vanilla gameplay - As a first time experience to get achievements, it's fine in its own right, but in comparison to what you can do with the player content regarding the mods (you can use building assets, props, etc. in vanilla), the gameplay is limited and quality of life for the player tends to be lower with the lack of performance mods.Difficulty - This is a double edged sword. Lack of difficulty is beneficial to those that simply want to build, grow and show off their skills with infrastructure building, and city painting. This is a negative for anyone that wants a challenging economy in vanilla. This will hold particularly true if you like that kind of gameplay in Simcity. Fortunately, for the challenge inclined, you can make it much harder on yourself with mods, and Scenarios are coming out soon, which will provide win and lose condition scenarios as part of the Disasters dlc. It will be free.TLDR: Love building, traffic wars, the almost endless beautification options, and I can be a major creep as I roleplay God with my topdown world view  as I stalk a handsome young man coming home from work as he goes home to sleep at night (he actually does live in that house). Glorious. Would I recommend to anyone that remotely likes city builders? Absolutely.			"

												I had an ice factory catch on fire. 69/10.No, but seriously. I have played a lot of city sims in my day (Simcity, Tropico, CitiesXL, etc) and I can say this is the best I have played. While the game may be hard to wrap your head around at first (the game does a poor job introducing you, and there doesn't seem to be any real tutorial) once you start learning how to create your districts, city blocks, highway systems, services, mass transit, etc. the game really starts to take off in sheer size and scope. The maps are huge and could easily take you weeks to fill out with a single city. It's a far cry from the tiny 'districts' from the latest Simcity. The mechanics, such as placing buildings and infrastructure, are intuitive and easy to use for the most part (the transit lines could use a bit of work), and rarely did I have to wonder ""why can't I place this here"" or ""why isn't this working?"". The amount of in-game content for your city is also quite robust, and the ability to download additional content via the workshop lets you add even more.This is a rock solid city builder that any fan of city sims or simulation games in general needs to own.9/10			"

												Cities Skylines is what Sim City (2013) should have been. I'm trying to think of a downside besides the fact the there's not a Gold Edition [Edit 2/2017] YES THERE IS YEAH --out that bundles all of the expansions into a single game.--Build a city and manage traffic from the ground up, master the joy of constructing blocks, roads, interchanges, you name it. Balance power, services, education, pollution, everything you know a good City Builder needs.Then realize it's 3am and you have work in the morning.			"

To honor this great game I deleted my old review and spend some time writing a new one.You should know that this game is a long-term investment. You have to spend a lot of time on it fine tuning but in exchange you'll get back a lot of excitement and room for creativity. You can start playing this game with no knowledge about city builder games but you will soon notice that the larger you city gets the more challenging the road network becomes. Although you need a bit of patient or else you won't like the game as much. You will have to bulldoze and rebuild streets sometimes multiple times. Just don't see it as negative point and don't get frustrated. Similar as if you draw a picture. Since this is a city builder you will spend most of your time designing road layouts and managing traffic. No one likes too much talking so here in short the positive and negative points.Positive:great graphics. Subjective yes, but you can customize the colors (LUT). If you install the correct one it will look photo realistic instead of colorfuleasy to learn. Even if you're a total beginner you will find fun in creating huge ""Wuselfaktor"" as we say in German. ""bustling factor"" might be the translation for itextreme high replay valueawesome community with massive amount of mods on the workshop. I highly recommended to install at least the following must-have.low system requirements without modslow price for base gamehuge maps to build ondifferent map themesSome content from DLCs is free for base game ownersweather and day/night circlecreating own districts and add policiesNegative:traffic sometimes doesn't want to use up all lanes. Thankfully I don't have this problem so often. There are multiple workarounds you can find, nevertheless it's my only real critics point. I managed to avoid this mostly by using highway exits only on one side. (So there are 2 lanes in total for the main traffic and one for the off/on ramps) As of writing the review the developers rejected to ever fix it. As reason for this they state the increase of the system requirements needed. no real on/off ramps for highways (they are basically just one-lane highways)vanilla buildings without mods are a bit too repetitiveexpensive DLCs (for that little content they add. Nevertheless you support the developers and got a cheap base game. I got myself most DLCs by now on a sale)chirpy can get annoying ;)the following must-have mods should have been in the base gameMust-have mods:Move it! (Honestly my favorite one. For details please check workshop)All 25 Areas purchasable (exactly). Mod Achievement Enabler (Or else you won't get achievements if you use mods)Dynamic Resolution (If you have a decent PC, get that to have way better AA via downsampling)Ambient Occlusion (Adds nicer and more realistic shadows on objects)Traffic Report Tool (Shows traffic routes. Good for beginners as well as experts)NoPillars (So you can easier build bridges)Network Extension Project (So you have more road types to build with. Not sure why so many are missing in the base game tbh.)Network Skins (Change the tree type on your road and more)One-Way Train Tracks (What it says)Fine Road Tool (Change road height in smaller steps)Don't crash (most important: it improves loading times)District UI Tweaks: Hide Names (Hides District names. Why is this not in vanilla C:S??)Any kind of traffic manager. Right now I use Traffic Manager President Edition. (You can play without fine, just needs more patient fixing AI traffic manually.)Extra Landscaping Tools (Very good!)Right now I have 280 mods installed. The game doesn't crash on my system regularly but it can happen. As always I recommend to save often with that many mods. PS: On the workshop there are 96.363 mods atm. Skyrim has 49,910 on Nexus mods. ;)			"

												Cities: Skylines is a single-player city-building simulator game developed by Colossal Order, and published by Paradox Interactive. SUMMARY:  This game is great. Anyone who plays this, even if you're not a fan of the city-building genre, will enjoy this game. Pros: -simplistic and colourful art style-great UI-lots of tabs & information-good camera controls-music fits in with the atmosphere of the game, and is also well made-zoning is easy and simple, same goes with power and water-real-time water physics-plenty of variety when it comes to types of houses that are built-cities are simple and fun to create-Steam workshop support-comes with a map & asset editor, and again, easy to use-the ability to see pollution-big maps-the ability to expand your map limits-UI animations are clean-balanced loans-taxing system is great-being able to see the sewer water flow down the water is a nice touch-you can stalk each and every person in your city, and see where they live, where they work, etc. (This is ASTONISHING)-depth of field adds a nice touch to the graphics-graphics, audio, etc. settings and sliders and detailed enough-optimization is decent-the ""twitter"" function at the top of the screen is nice, and it is enjoyable to see the tweets from your citizens-Steam achievements-monuments are detailed-pretty much everything is detailed in this game-health care, police, schools, and fire stations are all cool-green energy-animations are great and mix well with everything else-SFX are great-multiple brushes for filling in zones or other things (Plus like 50 more pros, as I cannot name all of them of the top of my head) CONS -bulldozing abandoned buildings are a pain to do-no big events/disasters-traffic sometime merge together			"

												The +'s+ Very Detailed Buildings, Roads, Cars, down to the physics in the water + Huge areas of land+ Multiple landscapes to pick from+ Ton of premade worlds to get started in+ Trains, Boats, Airplanes, Subway, Hearses, Trash Trucks, Fire Engine, Police Car, Ambulance and a bunch more animated vehicles!+ Every person is doing something in the city, with cool activities like a ton of different style parks, and hey actually animate them doing it!! Create a bus route and don't enough stops ? Hahaha well you will have a ton of people waiting outside because not enough stops and buses to meet the demand.+Awesome path editor with many different road types and bridges and scenery+ Steam Workshop+Easy UI+ Progressing with milestones feels rewarding+ Wind Turbines turn against wind, I thought this was really cool.Now there is a ton more +'s but my hand hurts from carpool tunnel from playing the game like 15 hours straight soHeres the -'s-Pathing on cars sometimes sucks bad-Not really many events other than random fires which don't spread =( ( Yes, there is a mod for this! Still should be done natively )-Road pathing tool can be pretty annoying when trying to upgrade skinny streets to wide streets-No Auto Save Feature (Yes, there is a mod for this! Still should be done natively)-No Cycle of day and night ( Yes, there is a mod for this! Still should be done natively )-Sometimes the game moves at such a fast pace that's not desirable, usually people like to speed it -up but if you have a decent city, the demand for structures will never stop or slow down! ( Can pause but a slow down option ? )-Wish there was weather other than the wind is moving this way or that wayThings I would like in the game*Riots ( Maybe a military base with units ? or swat team that could stop riots ?)*More Events*Spreading Fire ( Natively ) *( I am not sure if it exists outside of a mod ) But snow?*More things for people to do other than parks and plazas ( Baseball Park, Football Stadium, etc... I *know the workshop will have tons of this stuff, but it would be nice to have the professional touch on more buildings with animations! )  Btw the soccer park in the work shop is pretty cool!*Seasons that change on time of year*Night Mode with lighted sky scrapers and other modelsI highly recommend this game, although it's more serious sim then that which you can have fun destroying your creations ( at the time being at least ). $30 dollars is a great steal, if you are affraid of DLC, the workshop should ease that a but with over 20,000 items and growing!

												Cities Skylines is said to be a ""modern take on the classic city simulation"" and after playing around for many hours, it is on that path and it's the best we have of a new modern city building simulator, and it's the best we will probably have for a while.This is, to an extent, the city building game we've been waiting for, at least the best one we're going to get that's is satisfying, not buggy, not overly restricting, but one that's made with care, that's free from tiny shackles, with freedom and space to have creativity built in it, and one that's design nicely, combined with support for community support.

			We go to play around with it, and it's better than all city building games of recent years. More info at: http://KSalue.com End video song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVafDaVTVkk ~Twitter:...		

The look of the game is decently great, at least better looking that a rehashed game for the third time, but lowers than a heavily funded one. it's working, compared to other recent city builders, it has minimal bugs, runs smoothly, even hours after playing the game with a lot of structures being built. The restrictions on the game at its peek is minimal, exponentially smaller than a triple-A produced game of recent years, with the ability to remove all restrictions.The gameplay is slick and smoother, with normal decent controls and a good UI, and an even more detailed view of finer data like the space need to build a structure alongside a road, a better resource and feedback view, and other new elements introduced like noise pollution with elements and tools at hand to counter it. The game uses a nice system of the industry type zoning, with placing them in specific types of land with resources, and then applying the type of work they do with the use of the district painting tool. Certainly a new way of production that I haven't seen before, and it's kind of nice and sort of makes some sense instead of having just one building produce one specific type in mass.The transportation and traffic controls in the game is real and it packs a punch, as it was created by the same developers who made Cities In Motion 1 & 2, which was mainly focused and is specialized on the transportation systems. So if you don't have a nice road map for you city, you will probably have issues with other cervices doing their jobs and as a result having more issues to deal with, which is great.The problems with the game consist of the game not teaching you well enough on how the systems work, but you I managed to learn almost everything to make a decently big city on my second playthrough. My first time playing the game was arguably created a horrible city, but my second playthrough was a lot nicer after having all the experience and knowledge I gained from my first go at it, and at this point it's fine tuning with my third time at creating a nice city. Not a problem, more of a nit picky thing, the monuments in the game where mediocre in it's scale and design, as I wasn't overwhelmed by it's looks or scale. Plus, the game doesn't have any sort of flying services, which left me heavily focusing on my structural groundwork immensely more so I don't screw up later on and damage my city.Overall Cities Skylines is a wonderful city builder that I and many others needed, from the glorious days of the past, to the disappointments of modern times concerning a nice city builder, SC brings joy and hope that we finally get to have in this genre, for the asking price and for what you get and what you will get later on with support for community support, this is a definite good purchase.Shameless link[ksalue.com] to original post			"

												To me, this game has become the new modern standard citybuilding game. It's a game that feels like it is pushing the citybuilding game genre back to it's roots. Clearly the developers learned from the mistakes of Maxis and EA with SimCity; everywhere it failed to deliver, this game has got it. With a focus on things like Steam Workshop and modding it seems a thriving community will come of this game and clearly hasn't been made to become a DLC machine.

			Cities Skylines is a city builder game, that shows SimCity how a city building game SHOULD look! This First Look shows many details of Gameplay, including even things like mods!		

Pros:> Wide audience appeal. It feels that it can be as casual or as serious as you want it to be. Not at all daunting for a first timer to use, and even includes things like hard mode for the more seasoned city builder. > The game feels very well optimised and runs very nicely. Both my laptop and desktop PC play this game very well.> Easy to use world and assets editors for deeper customisation. Asset creations such as parks, buildings, intersections, props and even trees. All uploadable and retrievable through Steam Workshop.> It has a very detailed simulation of city life. Features things like dynamic water that makes dams usable, or gives you the ability to poison the city water supply with poorly placed pumping stations and drain pipes. You can follow people, cars, buses etc and you can see these people are living out daily lives. The city does feel alive.> Huge expandable worlds to build in. No more cities the size of a village like on SimCity. You can actually build massive sized cities!> You also have freely controllable taxes, funding and policies not only at a city level but also at a district level that can change the feel and dynamic of the cities and the people that live in them. You have a twitter-esque system that gives reports on how people are feeling based on tweets they make about the city.> There's lots to do with the roads. Many different shapes and sizes, one-way systems, highways, dirt roads, pavements etc, and they can all be raised, curved or done freeform.Cons:> No day or night cycle! It seems so many situations on the roadways (rush hours etc) can't be experienced, which makes the traffic feel a bit basic a lot of the time.> Whilst there is a lot to do with the roads, it's not always as accurate as I would like. It makes building more complex road systems a bit of a pain, and won't let you connect up roads and paths in a way you may want. I hope it gets an update soon to let us customise our roads even better.> I notice a lot of the same buildings appearing next to each other, like having a street with just the same burger bar a few times on it. More building variation and randomisation would be nice, but I imagine this could be solved with user-created content.> Some of the figures feel a bit off. The population figures always feel a bit low compared to what you may expect from the current state of your city.Overall it's a lovely feeling game and comparatively to other city builders to come out in recent years, this is definitely the pick of the bunch. It's well priced on launch compared to competitors, especially SimCity.			"

												Cities: Skylines is the city builder I've been waiting for since 2004. It is intuitive, has actual working citizen travel, flowing water, (mostly) realistic travel... and looks beautiful.It is also designed to be mod friendly and mods are already expanding the game within the first weeks of release.And no forced online or tiny city sizes. Even without mods, you can built a huge metropolis in this game.Downsides: traffic isn't perfect, so you can end up with unrealistic traffic patterns. The devs are working on this though.Music is forgettable. Nothing like the excellent SimCity series :/And it is extremely addictive. This game will cause you to be tired at work because you stayed up until 3am on a working day...TDLR: Best City Builder in over a decade. Buy it today.			"

												Cities: Skylines is the unofficial SimCity sequel we deserve! From the very beginning, the game feels much closer to SimCity 4 than the most recent iteration of SimCity. The game embraces Steam Workshop, and the amount of custom content already is outstanding. I have enjoyed every second thus far with the game and I wanted to share my thoughts on it for those of you on the fence.PROS-Steam Workshop Integration-Massive Cities-Enjoyable Challenge-Cities Feel Alive-Hours and Hours of Content-Great Price for Launch-Allows for Cities of All Shapes and SizesCONS-Traffic Needs Some Balancing-Lots of Repeated Buildings (Custom Content Helps)-Trash and Death Can Get Out of Hand Due to TrafficAll in all, I recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone who considers themselves fans of the simulation genre. The game is addictive and provides hours of fun. I am 15 hours in and I only have 50,000 people in my city with so much more land available to grow. The $30 is fair, but there is no excuse not to pick this game up at a sale price! "

												Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!I come from a long, proud line of urban planners. My father is an urban planner, as was his father, and his father before him (his father's father's father copulated with goats and is seldom brought up in polite conversation). But the fast cars/money/women/goats lifestyle of urban planning never appealed to me. Much to my family's chagrin I pursued writing, and they were (and continue to be!) devastated. Before disowning me my father sat me down at the computer and urged me to play Cities: Skylines. “This is in your blood son,” he smiled, weary from a hard day of urban planning. “Please. For me. For the family.”So I started to build my first city across from a scenic river... and, I don't know. I don't know how to explain it. It just clicked. I stretched roads in a grid and began zoning – visitors to my fair city would be greeted by our booming industry district, noisy and dirty and beautifully anarchistic; past the fuming towers they would admire our chic commercial district, busy with pedestrians and bathed in neon lights; further still they would find themselves in our residential district, with manicured lawns and parks and homes galore. But to build a city you have to do more than just plan. You have to create.I built powerful turbines to power my city and laid pipes for water to rush in and out. Satisfied I unpaused the game and watched. Slowly, skeletal structures emerged from the earth, supports were raised and lowered, and buildings became occupied. Little storefronts popped up, factories rose up, and dream homes were built. Cars flooded my little two lane streets, full of wide-eyed country bumpkins presumably. And things were good, for a time. I sat and watched my little citizens rush to and fro, traffic ebb and flow, and more buildings appear from empty lots.Perhaps my father had a point.Oh, an achievement unlocked!Bad Mayor. Have 15% Happiness.♥♥♥♥.I guess I wasn't paying close enough attention – wait, what do you mean “sewage is bubbling up?”And so my city, 420BlazeIt360NoScope, drowned in a sea of human waste. Langston Hughes, a dream deferred does indeed stink of rotten meat, for the record. It was also crusty.Cities: Skylines is the sleekest, smartest, and most potentialicious city builder available currently – and may possibly remain so thanks to integrated, dedicated modding support. You'll start off in the vanilla game with a single tract of land and an off ramp. To get your city off the ground you'll do what I mentioned previously - sans massive sewage backup. You'll zone districts, set up the water and electricity, and watch your little hamlet bustle. As your population grows so will your abilities and responsibilities. You'll have to build accessible clinics, police stations, schools, and fire stations. You'll have to keep pollution (sound, ground, and water) in check. Districts lines will be drawn and policies enacted, like establishing an industrial sector in a particularly fertile area as a farming region, or banning smoking in a residential area. Prompts will flash if garbage is getting out of hand, buildings are abandoned, taxes are too high, etc. In addition Chirper, the game's Twitter feed thingy, will tweet pertinent (if sometimes repetitive and annoying) information.With every addition and upgrade you'll have to expand further and further, balancing the budget, happiness, and health of your city along the way. Eventually you can purchase as many as nine map tiles, upgrading, rebuilding, rezoning, public transit, shipping... the scope of it is a little overwhelming (old hands at city building sims will find themselves in familiar territory and will likely have bustling metropolis' in no time. For the uninitiated I'd recommend watching the frequent Twitch streams and Youtube LPs)! Mastering C:S requires a great deal of foresight. Sure, you can build the cheap coal and oil power plants, but pollution will skyrocket and illness may spread. Build the more expensive green energy alternatives and you'll contend with noise pollution and have to choose more specific locations to place them. Traffic will begin to bottleneck on busier roads, and buildings out in the boonies will be more vulnerable to crime and fire (and fire crime, “arson” sounds much to pedestrian). When you have a breather, however, it's one of the most relaxing, satisfying games I've ever played. Watching your citizens go about their days is mesmerizing... people walk their dogs, firetrucks blare by, garbage trucks make their rounds. It feels alive.Despite some technical glitches (trains jumping tracks, cars driving into burning buildings, little oversights with no bearing that SHOULD be patched early into release), I don't really have any complaints. Yes, seasons and a night cycle would have been nice, more aesthetic “flavors” for buildings and locations would keep things fresh, and more “disasters” to deal with besides those created by player ineptitude would be fun to contend with (natural, human, seasonal, or just plain silly). While the vanilla game might get boring after twenty or thirty hours, there are already mods, new assets, and maps to spice things up. Just like a real city, a REAL community, this game's replayability will be dependent upon community involvement. And I predict a lot of brilliant mods and patches to come.There's something really special about C:S and I can't quite put my finger on it. It's like waking up on DESIGNATED APPLICABLE HOLIDAY morning to a big present, and you unwrap it and it's one of those farm playsets, or when you're zooming toy cars along the roads of your city map rug, or admiring an elaborate diorama in a quiet museum. And then somewhere nearby a toilet explodes.			"

												Cities Skylines is a wonderful city builder, it puts in so many unnessesary details that just make the game feel so alive.Pros:+Beautiful.+Camera controls are nice.+Crazy amounts of tiny details that go from every person having a name, house and job to street light flickering before they change.+A nice selection of maps to choose from.+Has that nice classic city builder feel to it.+Looks very modern.+Day 1 mod support.+Easy to use level editor+ building creator thing.+Lots of options for obtaining resourses.+Developers seem to be active and nice.+Sounds are nice.+Rewards you for milestones+Has actual water physics (which are not needed in a city game but are just another nice feature).Cons:-People are not happy with leisure even if there are parks everywhere-Some people won't be educated even though there is a school next to them.-Some of the random ""tweets"" get repetitive.-Dosen't have a tutorial for people who have never played a city builder before.-Because there is no tutorial I have no way or pre-planning anything that's about to come my way and I end up not being able to build things I need.-Citizens leave not because they are unhappy but because you didn't build something specific which the game wanted you to build which is a bit dumb.-Vehicles sometimes dissapear.-Bus, Metro, Trains and the rest of those are really frustrating to build and are really hard to learn how to even make without looking up a tutorial.-Sometimes the game won't let you build a road/build ext. because there is something in the way, but there isn't.Overall I rate this game a 9/10 has a fair amount of issues but still very fun and is a great game.

												I used to play and enjoy SimCity but I was sometimes disappointed especially with the traffic simulation. Then a friend recommended me to try Cities: Skylines. At first I thought it seemed a bit confusing compared to SimCity but after a while it became easy to play and I started enjoying it. I am impressed with the traffic simulation. It is very realistic and there are far more options when building roads. Of course SimCity has advantages in other ways but I am pleasantly surprised by Cities: Skylines and I can definitely recommend it!P.S. You end up being addicted to the game :D			"

(More road types, ability to place props, etc)Canals are slightly buggy when trying to build bridges over Tsunamis are a little op - barriers/greenery do little to stop waves :(Overall, I still give the game a solid 11/10 XDTake my money!!!! *Flings money at paradox*			"

												For me, a teenager who does no chores and has no source of income besides holidays and birthdays, $30 is a lot of money. It took me some convincing before I would buy a game worth that much. After I've watched/read various reviews of the game, which were all positive, I finally decided that I'd buy the game, and I'm happy with the decision. As of posting this review I only have about 2 hours played, but I can tell already that I'm going to love this game and probably play many more hours. There are so many features in this game, from big things like creating individual districts that have their own policies, to small things like renaming the residents of your city.The only visible flaw of this game to me, is the game's font. It's so small on my screen that it is almost unreadable. This problem is being experienced by many other players of the game aswell. As of now, that is my only problem with the game and I hope that it'll be fixed soon.I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes the City Builder genre. This game is the game that Sim City 2013 should have been.			"

												I find it difficult to 'review' Sim games because the tend to be more like toys than actual games.Alongside that, I've never really been that good at them. I have some tenure with three different SimCity games and it usually amounts to moneyflow being non-existent, and I just get frustrated and nuke the town with UFO's, Tornadoes, and Volcanoes. It was great fun for when I was younger, but now at my age I demand something more satisfying.Cities: Skylines delivers. With a modicum of patience, starting relatively small, I am actually capable of creating a city that functions.Granted I have a few issues, usually with traffic and land value. (My games I can’t usually afford to throw decent parks on every corner to make everyone happy). Regardless, my values tend to be over 70% in most cases and I call that a victory for my usual tenure in City-Sim games.That's not to say how much FUN I'm having with the game. There's just something so satisfying about seeing all those plots of zoning evolve into buildings, and in turn watching those buildings evolve on their own as they get better educated, higher land values, and more customers. I want to see them succeed because I want to see what they look like next!The workshop helps in this endeavor. One of my earlier complaints was that, after a few hours, building after building looked a bit same-y. The workshop introduces entire collections of buildings and downloading a few helps with variety and it's lovely to see.Using mods locks the ability to earn achievements. Practical, due to the infinite money mod available in the base game. However it's annoying in practice since I am treating this game like a sandbox and a toy, so I activate a few mods and then just let the fun fly.Thankfully the fun factor outweighs my need for achievements.Ultimately, it's one of the first Sim games I've been able to succeed at. It's taking me away from some of my other duties on MMO's and the like, and considering playing one MMO is like having a part time job in its own right, this is quite the accomplishment for a quaint 30$ game.

												TL;DR: sandbox game for creative players. If your creativity is channeled through problem-solving, then this game will leave you wanting.I have tried so hard to like the game.Hands-down, technically the best city-builder since Sim City 4. The problem is: I don't have the urge to come back to it. 5 hours in, lack of interest settles in, I just give up and start over. Rince and repeat. I can't find the fun though I'm looking hard.Therefore it's aimed at creative players, who just play on unlimited resources and invest time in designing a beautiful city.Lack of challenge makes you fail to see the point of anything after a couple hours. ""Ok, I can improve traffic, but what's the point, people still come to my city and budget is fine anyway"". ""Criminality? Okay, whatever. Budget's fine"".""Cool, I can fine tune the budget with all the sliders!... I can make tax-free zones for specific industries!... but I don't care and won't ever use it because there's absolutely no point"".If you're the kind of person who just wants to design stuff, then you'll have a blast. If you channel your creativity through problem-solving, then boredom will settle in quickly.If you're anything like me, then you will find that there's no point in moving away from the ""grid"" city-design. Every block is a square, crossroads are crosses, because that's the more efficient choice. So if you're a problem solver, all your cities will look the same.That may sound stupid to Americans, but here in old Europe, cities have grown organically over the course of millenias: cars are barely allowed in medieval city centers, which have tons of pedestrians-only walkways; low-rent flats are usually in the cities' outskirts; then, further away, the big business center with highrises, accessible by road or public transportation, built in a very windy spot or on an old marsh, because that's the only spot where our ancestors didn't build anything...I dream of the day a city-builder will have us build a city through the ages. Imagine the challenges! Your 1200 AD city needs wall for defense, but cannons will soon render this useless and you'll be left with crumbling walls dividing your city between center and outskirts. Industrial revolution comes around and now you need housing for workers, railroads for supply: means you have to burn down some of those outskirts houses and decide what to do with their poor inhabitants... Enters XXth cenury, in order allow cars into the city you need larger avenues, so then again you need more space! Residents won't be happy... Then, fast-forward 2010, there is so much traffic that you need to reshape everything around cycling and public transportation...You could choose to start in the New World around 1600 AD, where challenges are entirely different...If you built your city originally on a marsh, or trapped between mountains, or in windy plains, then you would have different challenges and opportunities, renewed every new era.Now, THAT would keep me playing till 4am. Cities: Skylines? Sadly, no.			"

Best city building game out thereI can‘t really tell for how long i have waited for game like this. I always wanted to build a big city, manage it and what is most important feel that the city is alive. And this game delivers.As in every game you start with nothing. You start building roads and zoning and people starting to move in. They require electricity, water and other services. After you provide people with everything they need the buildings start to level up and grow.  Step by step your little city becomes more beautiful with every year. After a while your city is full of skyscrapers and is busy 24/7. With the „After dark“ update you got the night/day cycles and it looks amazing. You just look at your city every night, it‘s so beautiful. Also you as a mayor can manage your city. Apply various policies to districts, like ban smoking, encourage biking or ban heavy traffic just to name a few. You can set the taxes for your residents and business and set the budgets of city services like garbage collection, electricity, water, public transport and a few dozen more.People in this game are not just pixels moving in random directions. Every person has a name, home and a job. He goes from his home to a job to a commercial district and back home. Every resident is simulated individually. Similar to Tropico series, but Cities skylines has much more to simulate.Of course like every game this one is no exception and has some flaws.The traffic is the most annoying. You will spend a lot of time managing the traffic, building and rebuilding roads. The previous game these developers have done is called Cities in motion and we can see it influenced Cities skylines, because required attention to traffic is a little too much. AI cars are stupid and don‘t know how to use lanes thus causing congestions. Of course every city has congestion problems and stupid drivers exists in real life too. So maybe it‘s not that bad, but anyway it could be better. Some mods can improve the traffic, but they don‘t change much. The game lacks in management aspect. Yes you can manage your city but it lacks depth. It is too simple. I would like to have poor districts with bad education levels, where crime rate is high and police officers get shot often and you could apply some stricter policies over there or just leave them be in anarchy.Graphics in Cities skylines can be very beautiful, especially at night. Sometimes colors are off a bit, but all in all the game looks amazing. But this comes with a price. I get 25-30fps with GTX970 wich is not acceptable, but because it‘s not an action game i can live with that. I could lower some settings but i want my city look good, it‘s not an action game so it‘s playable at 30fps.Developers support modding very much, the game has steam workshop full of mods. I doubt anyone is playing this game without mods. You can download cars, planes, trains, buildings etc. to beautify and diversify your city. Also there‘s color corrections, some gameplay improvement mods and many more.If you like city building and management games this is a must have. And considering the price it‘s worth it even without a sale, you‘ll get hours of playtime from it. Do not expect much on economic side, but all the city building is done almost perfectly.Pros:Lets you build big citiesLooks gorgeosBuilding themes lets you build a different looking city every timeMod supportCons:Lacks depth in managingDumb AI causing traffic problemsPerformance  "

												Oh boy, this ♥♥♥♥ing game.Cities: Skylines is Sim City. No need to call it a spiritual successor or anything, this game apes Sim City in every way as far as I can tell. I recall faint memories of attempting to play Sim City 2000 back when I was a little kid but the interface and gameplay was far too complex for me. I had more fun loading up the pre-set savegames of a sprawling metropolis and destroying it with robots or aliens and whatnot. I don't even really have any experience with any city simulators. However, this game does a modern Sim City better than any other game has done in recent memory.I don't have much experience with any city simulators. Now, I'm certifiably addicted to this game. The interface is stellar, the music charming. The sound effects are invigorating. The little dings as buildings level up fill my heart with happiness. The way your tiny ant-like populace pours out of your metro system after arrival is satisfying, as you know they're not using congestion-inducing personal vehicles. The ability to ""paint"" different zones, whether residential, commerical, or industrial is so delightful it's difficult to describe. Watching little buildings pop up, filling with residents populating the area is incredible to behold. You can even name every single object in the game, whether it be a building, a citizen, or even some random cougar roaming in the countryside. I took it upon myself to name every High School I built after any American presidents i can think of.I never thought this would happen, but as of 3/16/15 Cities: Skylines is my GOTY of 2015. It's been quite some time when a video game can suck away my time as well as this one. There's always more land to develop, more resources to export, more ways to attempt to fix your horribly congested traffic ♥♥♥♥ups. While the game doesn't do a perfect simulation, as the AI drivers refuse to take up multiple lanes in some instances, the amount of detail is incredible. Everyone wants to go somewhere, and all the cars are traveling with a purpose. It is important to make sure all the needs of your city are met, whether it be water, waste, dead people, sick people, schooling, fires, it really becomes overwhelming really quick. In fact, most of your first attempts at this game will create perpetual hellholes of civilization, tall gloomy buildings stuffed with stinking dead bodies and backed up sewage. However, in my opinion this does only galvanizes you to make your city better, by redirecting traffic and building public transports to lessen the load on commuter roads. Who knew city planning could be so fun?Cities: Skylines isn't perfect, as evidenced by the traffic stingy AI and sometimes confusing circumstances where pressing criteria around the city aren't clear. There aren't any disasters that can hurt your city (other than accidental flooding from a Hydroelectric Dam). However, as seen by the ridiculous amount of mods that have hit the steam workshop a mere few days after release, this may be remedied. You can even create your own landscape using the map editors, and I dread to see what messing around with that will do my free time in the future.If you have any interest in city simulations at all, you need to get this game now. Probably the best one to come out in a long, long time.			"

												I've been a big fan of city simulation game since simcity 4 came out, and after dissapointing of recent city simulation games, Cities:Skyline become something that we fans are waiting for, a new benchmark and worthy successor of sim city 4.Cities skyline has massive map, great complexity and details for a city simulation game especially on traffic, i dont even know traffic management can be so frustating yet so challenging However, despite its addictive gameplay cities skyline still have something to improve, it lacks of disasters, day-night cycle and varieties of buildings.it seems so repetitive on building models.Fortunately, community of cities skyline so lively, i spent so many hours just browsing mods in steam workshop, choosing building models, gameplay mods and many more.Finally. Cities:Skyline has so much fun to offer.I think Cities:Skyline is the best city simulation game right now and im impressed when i knew that only 9 people worked on this game, yet it deliver such an astonishing experience, 9/10.

												Cities: Skylines is the best city-builder in recent times. There's no bullcrap always online, you can expand your borders quite far - and they all merge into one map so you don't have a loadingscreen while switching between them. There is also support for a modding community to add to the game.Building a stunning metropolis spanning a huge area is both easy - perhaps a bit too easy, but I expect patches and mods will add some more challenge - and a lot of fun!It's simply everything SimCity should have been, and more.Gameplay:

												This is an outstanding game. This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.Highs:* Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.* Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.* Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.* Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.Lows:* The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000. * Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it's almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.* The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don't often line up well. My metro station might say ""100 per week"" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.Verdict:If you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept. I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre, and this is not one of those. Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessible.			"

												If you're reading this, I'm glad you take the time to read reviews before you buy a game. But I can assure you, you can stop reading reviews for this game and buy it right now (or as soon as you can). Simply put, this is the best city-builder released for more than 12 years, since SimCity 4. Half the price as SimCity 2013 but with many more features, this game is easily worth the $30 price tag. Perhaps even buy the deluxe edition for the extra $10; the developers deserve it (the game was made by a team of about ten people).So stop reading this review and buy the game.For those still unsure about their purchase of this game, I'll now list some of my favorite parts, many of which SimCity 2013 and other city-builders lacked.1.) One-way-roads and roundabouts2.) Water physics: water pumps, sewage drains, treatment plants, and dams influence water levels3.) Parked cars. Doesn't seem like this should be a new feature in city-builders, but it is. Cars park on the side of the road and in parking spots.4.) Districts and policies: paint districts on certain parts of your city to keep track of things better and issue local policies.5.) Mods galore. The workshop is filled with various mods and the game has an asset and map editor built in.Hopefully that small list of a few of my favorite things has convinced you to buy the game. Cities: Skylines will undoubtedly reshape the city-building genre, and will continue to do so for years to come, as the devs have promised extended support to as much as ten years.UPDATED Sept 24th, 2015:For the DLC haters out there, this game will have plenty of DLC during it's long run. However, they'll be cheap (the one just released, After Dark, is only15 USD) and add actually new things that matter. Releasing along side every DLC is a patch that adds plenty of new features for people who don't buy the DLC (in the case of After Dark, non-DLC people will still get the day-night cycle among other things for free).

												I had actually started to believe that we were never going to see another great city simulator and then Paradox sprung this on us. Cities: Skylines went back to the simulators that were fun, pulled the best parts of them, and upgraded them to today's standards. It's fun without being overly punishing but still provides a challenge for those of us who want it. Sure it isn't perfect, but there are few games that even scratch that lofty goal.Probably the biggest issue is the lifespan of the citizens. All citizens lead a perfect and full life. This means if you have 2000 people move into your city all at once, they all die at the same time. It's really frustrating until you realize what's happening at the simulation. But there's a mod that changes that, giving citizens variable length lives.But that's the only real problem with this game. There can be some other gripes made about performance of 100k+ cities and traffic management nightmares, but I've never met a modern simulator that doesn't have those issues. Simply put, if you want a city simulator that's worth the money, you can't go wrong with Cities: Skylines.			"

												I've always liked city builders and this is a god sent after the latest disapointment in certain other series.Graphically it's easy on the eyes but nothing mind blowing. Warm colors.Game is easy to start and if you don't mess up completely in the beginning getting your city up and running shouldn't be an issue. Has hard mode where things are more expensive and you can also start with unlimited money if you just want to build.Big area where you can spread out your fledgling little town and thanks to mod support you can have even more space where to build. You can also make your own assets or download ready ones from Workshop and plenty of different mods are available too. From traffic management to automatically bulldozing abandoned and burned buildings.Dealing with the traffic can be a pain in the posterior sometimes in this game and you should be prepared to deal with it. Enough jams and nothing works. Fire engines get stuck in traffic and fires start burning your place down.There is no disaster system in game currently if that's something you miss and need from Sim City titles.Game runs okay, with larger cities it might start slowing down a bit. Every citizen is simulated where they are coming and going and it takes it toll when you have large enough population.If you're planning on unlocking all the buildable area with mods and your computer isn't quite up to date it's something to keep in mind.There are occasional bugs here and there like ships roaming the country side if you do certain things and traffic not using all the available lanes on a road.Doesn't have always online requirement but you can't build multiple cities and have them work together either.

												Cities: Skylines is a city builder game of your dreams. You can design almost every detail including appearance of buildings, parks and other stuff, but it is only for the most fanatic players. General player population (Inc. Myself) will get with projecting town streets where the game also gives you a huge opportunity to be creative by designing every angle, every corner of the streets and planning where will be commercial, residential and industrial zones as we know it from the old Simcity franchise. You have to care about your citizens to make city prosperous, build hospitals, police offices, fire stations, cemeteries, public transport systems, roads etc. and enable easy access to these facilities.  If you do it right there won't be problems with traffic jams and that's the biggest obstacle not only in every simulator of this type, but also in real life. So the Cities: Skylines has everything it should, but it also has another assets to offer: unlocking buildings like Hadron Collider or Fusion power plant and many more can get your attention and believe me achieving those is a long way. One of the most interesting things are districts and policies. You can divide your city into smaller districts applying another policies in different parts. For example you can lower taxes in newly developing areas to grab attection of investors or ban smoking and demand smoke detectors in industrial areas to prevent them from fire threat and many more. I really appreciated land value index by which you can deduce how different city parts are doing.The game can entertrain you for hours and it's really fun, but there are some imperfections I have to criticize. The most significant is  once you get from the first struggles of a newly developing town, after making the first profits the game seems to me too easy, I'd appreciate some random events, all i care after that is traffic and that's what can be really annoying after a while. 7.5 /10 "

												Fun game.  About the best city builder on the market near as I can tell.  That said, the DLCs are cancerous as they usually tend to be.  Day/night cycle, Snow, and natural disasters should not be $15 bucks each to have in the game.If they came with some huge new features, I'd get it.  But a lot of it is patched in for free, so I'm not sure exactly what they expect me to pay for?  A snow map?  For $15?I dunno guys.  I do love the game, but you need to add more than superficial features to ask $15 USD.			"

												For anyone looking for countless hours of fun, this is your game. Cities: Skylines provides countless hours of fun, but challenging, hours of game play. In cities: Skylines, you get to basically manage your own city. To sum it up, Cities: Skylines is the best city manager simulation I know. Here are some pros and cons of the game.PROS:-Beautiful Graphics-Good concept-Has amazing workshop Mods-Thrill of being able to tax other people (my favorite!)-Easy to learn about-Provides a challenge (in some ways) -Great for players looking for something to do-The new Natural Disasters are amazing-The new DLC Natural disasters lets you bust criminals from a helicopterThese are just some of the pros this game providesCONSEvery game has a downside to it. Here are a few you might want to think about before buying-Some of the in-game challenges such as death care and traffic can be hard to solve, but can be resolved with experience and (LOTS) of patience-Id say a good computer is needed to play this game without lag. This game is playable with lag, but will slightly impact your enjoyment of the game.Overall, Cities: Skylines is a great game. I've been playing this for a while now, and I believe I will continue to do. I look forward to the next update and recommend for players to buy this game.			"

												This is pretty much much improved/fixed version of the latest SimCity, with some pros and cons of its own:Pros:- Maps are much bigger. Each starting city part is already bigger than tiny SimCity maps and you can buy adjacent lands to make it x9 times bigger still.- Smarter traffic controls. Though there are some issues with cars disappearing or turning in the middle of the road or going through each other - at least routing works. You don't have to wait hours for an ambulance or fire truck to reach its point, garbage gets collected, resources get sold.- Paint and fill tools for zoning (finally!).- Road connections can be edited. You are not restricted to just one entry point.- Pipes and power lines are back.- Can move buildings to another spot for a fee.- Fluid mechanics when placing an electric dam.- Overall better UI, city info panels and responsiveness (no fudged data like in SimCity - the number of workers and residents adds up).Cons:- Plopping/building snapping. Unfortunately they added the same damn thing as in SimCity and restricted placing buildings only near roads. This results in a lot of wasted space between road connections and in small spaces. It cannot be switched off either.- No tutorial whatsoever and the hint system doesn't cover everything. Took me a while to realize that my elderly population doesn't work and i have to constantly build new houses like in Banished.- No landscaping tools.- Not enough parks. Most of them are huge so there is really no way to make beautiful city centres unless you are building in squares.- Weather and time of day do not change.- Zoning and placing roads is often a chore since they rarely snap at proper angles... again unless you build in squares.- Annoying sounds and twitteresque replacement of the ""news ticker"" from SimCity.- Biased approach to power plants - they are basically forcing you to be eco friendly since wind turbines are cheaper and more efficient than everything else. This is very unrealistic and unfair in my opinion.- Can't view overlays and build at the same time. Huge oversight since you need to know where to zone industrial for ore and farm placement.- All of the public transportation lines look the same, got same colour (all of the bus lines are the same colour and all of the metro lines too) and are generally hard to create and distinguish.- Lack of building upgrades. This probably was the only good idea from SimCity that should've been copied here.Overall there are quite a few annoyances and issues at the moment but all of them are compensated by the fact that this game is actually fun and doesn't feel like a couped up  tiny sandbox like SimCity.Its definitely better than CitiesXL as well, since it performs and runs smoother, uses more than 1 core, does not appear to have memory leaks and feels generally better made. The only issue i've encountered so far is some sound stuttering.So i can recommend this if you like city building games and were disappointed by every other game in the last few years.			"

												It has a lot to love and some not so much to love.It is one of the best City Sims in years and it can be a blast to play and has lots of mods and no online needed.It also does not look to shabby given the size of the maps.I must admit though due to some issues at times it can just be boring and frustraiting to play and deal with as a full on SIM.The maps are decent size and if you have the pc a mod can make it even bigger.The mods are plenty and quiet a few of them are nice.Depite the poor choice for AI and driving it can still be managed without getting the dreaded wave of death by simply not expanding at a rapid pace and they will not die in waves.I do think they should have invested the resources into other things because frankly the biggest eye sore of the game is the fact that they all pile into one lane.They plan out there trip ahead of time and lack the smarts to change it on the fly.I would have prefered to have simulated traffic on roads that just showed generic traffic as highways are useless since they all tend to use one lane the whole trip.Though all of that i can forgive as no game can be perfect and have all the right things but one thing that should have been in since day one is seperate funding for each service instead you change it for everyone and also forces you to put down way more services then needed.Then forces you to spend twice as much as needed becuase of the lack of sliders to each service building.SimCity 4 had this and that was on single core and how many years ago?So that would have to be my biggest irk of the game the rest i can over look as its managable but i waste way to much money on this issue and still have issues with coverage.Do not get me wrong as pure building sim it is a lot of fun and can be great but as anything more it fails badly at it.The challange is weak, A.I is horrible.The DLC is over priced unless 50% off just not worth it.As i said before if they would have put more into other things then the worthless A.I. driving this game imo could have went from good to fantastic as a simulation.As it stands now trash services is well excuse my pun but it is trash.How you mange death is terrible because of how terrible the driving A.I. isThe management end of the game is not so great due to lack of much depth and the biggest issue other then the driving A.I. screws up trash and other services.The way money is handled and control of each service is terrible because you can not decide which building gets what funding and coverage it is all shared across all services on the whole map.SimCity 4 did way better on the simulation end then this game most likely ever will out of the box.As a city builder this game shines as a simulation its damn near a flatline.ProsNo online needed.Tons of mod support.Huge maps.Bicycle and Bus lanes,Trams with DLCConsPaying for Disasters that even Maxis included for freeTrams need over priced DLCTerrible services on all fronts due to terrible A.I traffic.Busted micromanagementServices budget changes across whole map instead of each buildingNo real challange and day and night seem to have little impact on the economy in fact school seems to run 24/7.In the end it still one the better city sims and i would say buy it if you love building stuff but sadly a pass if you like simulation of running a city SC4 does this a lot better.If only CO would have just took some cues from SC4 and how they did simulation of being a mayor this would be a must buy for all simulation fans regardless if you like to build or manage.

												Cities: Skylines feels like a proper successor to the classic SimCity games.  If you grew up on classics like SimCity, SimCity 2000, and SimCity 4, you'll probably feel at home here.  For those not familiar, in this genre you build a city by zoning out commecial, residential, and industrial areas as well as the necessary infrastructure (roads, water, power) and an increasing number of other public goods such as police protection, fire protection, education, etc.  You set tax rates which impact the economy, and try to stay in the black and allow your city to continue to grow.  It's an addictive experience of constant expansion, with another thing you want to build or problem you want to fix always on the horizon and keeping the real-time game version of ""one more turn"" on your lips.  As with most of these games, one of the things you'll spend the most time on besides simply laying out more roads and then laying down zones and support buildings is traffic management, and at this Skylines shines.  The road construction system offers you a wide variety of to configure your roads with different sizes, one-way-vs-two-way, overpasses, etc, and the traffic flow responds to what you build in sensible and complicated ways.  It's a compelling component of the game that can consume hours of your life.  Additional options such as foot paths, bus routes, trains, and subways can also lighten the car traffic in your city.  Skylines also features an intersting ""neighborhood"" system where you can subdivide your city into different sections and set different city ordinances or economic focuses for each one.  While I don't feel that the mechanics of this have as much impact as I might like, just being able to district your city into distinct neighborhoods with their own names helps bring your city into focus and give it more character and specificity.(the Nightlife expansion also adds to this system, but most of my playtime was done before that came out so I'm not reviewing the expansion content, here)  Things I don't lke about the game?  Primarily, it feels too easy.  Even from the start I virtually never drifted into the red, although I would occasionally stall out and need to make some tweaks to keep growing.  This seems like it'd be something that is mod-able, but better difficulty options for veterans of the genre who want a challenge would be nice.  Additionally, as your city develops it seems that older industrial neighborhoods will occassionally suffer mass unemployment for no apparent reason.  The economic specializations you can assign to neighborhoods, in particular, suffer from this doubly and feel like a very short road to a dead end.  The industrial collapse itself is a good thing- an interesting challenge to tackle in a game that generally lets you just keep expanding with ease- but the feedback as to why it happens is poor.  For example, faced with the situation I'd frequently click on the buildings and see that they had no workers.  Thinking that I'd simply educated my populace out of wanting those jobs, I'd try building a school-free slum neighborhood nearby to see if that brought the businesses back, but the businesses remained without workers for no apparent reason.  Also, the in-game twitter-alike is inane and way too chatty, but this is a minor quibble.  Other than these complaints, I could list a score of minor to moderate UI annoyances- the inevitable consequence of playing a bunch of a game- but the only one that really sits heavily in my mind is the dread I'd feel whenever I made significant changes to my subway system.  It's not always clear what happens to existing routes when you make changes and getting a big-picture view of what all of your current routes look like in aggregate can be difficult; a cleaner and color-coded subway route map view would be nice.  All in all, I'd heartily recommend Cities: Skylines as an enjoyable sandbox that can easily consume dozens of hours of your life.			"

85/100 This new city sim has taken all of the good things from previous sims and builded upon it to create a solid and polished experience with new added features such as a nice water simulation including fluid physics. The sim is a bit on the easy side and for my taste it could have had more micromanagement to keep you busy and challenged, but what is there in the game is all very well done and it offers very enjoyable gameplay. On top of that the performance (unlike other sims) stays excellent even if you have a massive running city.			"

												Easy to learn, easy to master. If you though Sim City was disapointing, and wished it was better, this would be the game they would make. It has so much replay value, and thanks to user created content. It can extent the life of this game for ever. There will most likely be DLC's to come out with it.9/10eNjoy =^-^=			"

												Beautiful Game Cities skylines,it is the best city builder game now i think.I think ıf you look how many hours ı have  played this game you will understand this game is awesome. On Cities:Skylines you choose a map to build your city then you create your own city.You can build the city in your dreams.You can build a canals city,mountain city,European City,Mediterrenian City,Tropical City,Asian City,American City,Soviet City...And ı think the game is better with mods.for example with mods you can just allow construction of baroque buildings or classic American houses,Soviet houses... but you need to download that district styles.You can download thousands of mods but if you download too much mods you need to wait more at downloading screen.for example ı have near 900 mods and ı wait near 5 minutes at first then ı wait near 10-15 minutes when ı'm loading my city.And you can download lots of famous landmarks,buildings...you can download lots of useful buildings,props,shops,bars,train and metro stations,cars,city halls,statues,Mosques,Churcs,Synagouges,parks,roads,tree,hotels... My advices for new update,DLC or next Cities game:-It would be great if peoples will be satsified when there is lots of trees at their neigborhood.-It would be great if peoples need a place to pray to the God.like Mosques,Churcs,Synagougs.(You can download that buildings but they're like landmark.)-Bicycle roads would be great.

												This won't be a long review. I will say this. If you like city building games and responsive studios, this is the game for you. There are freebees still being added to the game to this day. Little things that you would normally have to purchase in a DLC are given to us. Support from the studio is amazing. The gameplay is amazing. The ability to mod is amazing. The workshop content is amazing. If I had one complaint, it would lane management for traffic. This has been worked on though and is already better than it was just a couple months ago. With that being said, traffic stops being as much of an issue once you understand the mass transit options within the game.Buy the game. It is worth every penny.			"

												Incredibly fun, easy to learn and definitely one of those games you might be playing for years to come. Cities: Skylines is that one city-sim you were waiting for.The modding community is very active and offers a range of improvements, additions and changes to make your cities even better!Some of the pro's and con's:+ Looks very nice, both in high-up view and zoomed all the way down to the pedestrians.+ Public transport works pretty good and will adapt to your radical changes to roads.+ Decent depth without getting too precise; no nagging citizens unless they really need something.+ Gigantic maps to make your dream cities- Garbage can get a little annoying; get some mods to fix this.- Roads will become congested. Perfect planning will be inevitable or your city will come to a breaking halt.- Certain aspects like organically flowing roads will take a toll on your available lots; you have lots of room though so spread out!All in all it's the best city-sim I've played. Definitely worth the money!			"

												In my opinion, this picks up the torch from Simcity 4. It is an actual city building game (which doesn't require an internet connection btw) that has pretty much everything I liked about the older games in it, but it also adds in a few fresh mechanics that keep things interesting. The traffic patterning, the modeling of pollution, and the electrical grid I find to be vast improvements over older games mechanically, and I love the water effects as well(I spent a good 5 minutes watching a dam fill up. It was mesmerizing) The only thing that I can gripe about if I get really nitpicky is that you have to plan transit routes and I would like more transport options. However, those could be easily rectified with a mod similar to NAM for simcity 4, and this game is designed to be easily moddable. Other than that, it's a very stable game which isn't terribly resource intensive for your PC. 10/10 would inadvertantly flood the highway leading into town with a dam again.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Colossal Order Ltd. Publishers: Paradox Interactive Initial release: March 2015Genre: Simulation, City Builder #Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationCities: Skylines is a city builder and economy simulator in the vain of the oh so fallen from grace SimCity. Skylines is essentially a sandbox for you to plan out, build certain amenities and hopefully people will want to move in and make your city thrive. Initially when you first jump into the game it starts with many of the options grayed out and it sort of gates you in this manner as you get used to the basics of building roads and zoning out areas as well as providing electricity, water and sewage treatment facilities. Then, as things unlock such as healthcare facilities and schools, you'll be able to get a better grasp of each system. You'll have access to crime, fire safety reports. As well as noise and actual pollution overlays. Should you desire to “go green” the use of wind turbines are also available as well as a corresponding wind chart for peak efficiency. The game makes use of a relatively humorous but sometimes annoying fake twitter for your citizens to @mention you and tell what you're doing wrong and in rare cases what you are doing right. At least in my experience. You can inact policies like water preservation or power conservation and even things like mandatory smoke alarms in homes. Typically, at the cost of increased upkeep while decreasing use of resources or in this specific case the likelihood of fire even though that's not technically what fire alarms do. This is how the game “gameifies” that sentiment. Anecdotal experience warningThere are weather effects and a day/night cycle. Which led to a moment I don't often have in gaming that was slightly existential. For setup, I was early on in my learning the game and had not really understood how to get things going faster when the first night struck. Without power, without people living in my city, it was entirely pitch black; And I had this rather obvious realization the more I think about it but at the time was borderline transcendental though I'm not fond of the connotations of that word; I was sat there “We really are just floating on a rock out in space”. As though this was not already obvious to everyone. This just seemed like a very odd and probably the least likely of places or style of game for someone to have that thought process. Let alone in a game at all. Anyways, back on pointThe game also features mod and steam workshop support which leads to nearly endless types of buildings and other various ideas that modders can come up with. There is also economy and budget screens to adjust taxes on different districts or different zones. As well as increase or decrease funding of maintenance on city utilities and services. If I had anything bad to say about the game is that it is not always overtly clear how to do something. It requires a lot of tooling around and experimenting.  In a very specific example setting up bus routes is rather ill contrived, at times down right purposely misleading in its functionality. Though a tutorial on proper usage can easily be sought out if need be outside the game. It also features what I'd consider a fairly unique aesthetic. It does indeed have a film grain slider. Which when combined with the depth of field and lighting gives this almost physical model like appeal.  Like it's a table in your basement with your model trains running along it. Zooming in, if you just look down a street it almost feels alive. I want to invoke the powers of Mr. Rodgers here but I fear the reference may be lost among the traffic. THE GISTSuperb city builder that scratches the niche of well done and in-depth simulation that many games seem to miss.Follow my curation for more "

												When writing this I have about 13h of playtime and the ""endgame"" is yet to be experienced, but so far I lack the words to describe the amount of joy this has given me. I always been a big fan och city builders and was a little worried that this one would not live up to my expectations, like some other games in the genre....But boy this one delivers more then I could ever hope for, it's only been out for a few days and it feels extremely well polished and the amount of effort put into the small details is amazing. Probably a quarter of the time I spent in my cities have been just enjoying how it looks and following the citizens around doing what they do. The agent system the citizens are based around works quite good and basically everything can be renamed, from people to buildings.It is also possible to zone different regions in the city and give them individual focuses and different policies wich is an amazing feature that does alot for the immersion, and I would imagine could be awesome for those that likes to recreate irl cities.The tools the game has available for creating roads is really solid to, personally I love to create spaghetti junctions and overly complicated networks that barely work and then try to fix them up. The traffic simulator is working and it feels like it responds to changes in the network quite well. Public transport for the game I have mixed feelings about, you have to manually create lines for busses, trains etc using a similar but less complicated system from Cities in Motion. This has the potential to be something really good but at the same a tedious task, and it makes me wish there were more tools to track groups of citizens travelling paths.I haven't played around with mods and custom assets yet but the built in features seems to be really good and the steam workshop integration allows easy access to other peoples creations, some amazing mods for this is bound to happen.I could write alot more about this but I don't have time... I want to get back to play it again!			"

												City Skylines is a 4/5.It's to what most sim games should strive.I'd play it for days,watch my citizens play,if only I could keep them alive.The systems are efficent and clear,Though there may be nothing new here.Zoning and crime,I do it all the time,and it's not hard at first, either.But it gets more complex as the game progresses.And with it comes many stresses.Traffic, dead bodies, and trash,fires can happen in a flash,and then your citizen die by the masses.The infrastructure is often a bother.It's hard to manage the clutter.Need more power, my man?Go build a dam!But, oops, your city's underwater!But that's just how it goes,it'd be boring without all of those!Who wants a town building sim,without some margin,of error, or disaster imposed?So like I said at the beginning,this game is really worth getting.It can be hard at times,managing waste and the crime,but I love it for all its forthcomings.

												EDIT: Released new ""Disasters"" DLCs on 11/30/16. I still recommend the game but there currently are a bunch of game-breaking bugs. So hold off purchasing the game for maybe a week or two.EDIT 2: 1/2/17 - Most of the recent game-breaking bugs have been squashed, I re-recommend C:S. Happy 2017!As of 7/12/16 and with 103 hours of playtime, I think I can make a solid review about this game. Long story short, I bought this because the new Sim City was trash, but I was not ready for this game to exceed my expectations.Now for a short review: (SKIP TOWARDS ""I'M TOO LAZY"" IF YOU ARE TOO LAZY TO READ THE FULL REVIEW) Cities: Skylines is a phenomenal city building game, perhaps even better than any of the Sim City games. It is a sandbox game that has an unlimited replay value and will devour hours of your days.  Its laid-back graphic style, realistic audio effects, and relaxing music provide a calm and entertaining game time.  The game unrestrically allows you to build at your own pace while providing a fun challenging experience.While the game is a little tough on beginners (it has very few basic tutorials) it still seems easy to get a hang of. With time, and the Steam community guides, you will become a master of this game and having done so without much frustration, a simple learning curve.Between all of the user created mods, bountiful amount of vanilla game content, and developers amazing DLC, you will undoubtedly enjoy every game session and you will never find the game repetitive.I, without any hesitation, fully recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone interested in purchasing this. Even if you are new to the city building genre, you will appreciate every cent you paid for this game because of what it has to offer.I'M TOO LAZYPros:- Limitless replayability- Abundant game content (including free mods and game DLC)- Steam workshop support- Challenging but funCons:- Larger cities can reduce framerates, even on beefy computers- Difficult for new players (lacks necessary tutorials)- OST unintersting (unlike Sim City 4) and the DLC radio music isn't very goodI'm sure I will have missed some things (both good and bad) worth mentioning so feel free to comment on this review or ask questions in the discussions. The Cities: Skylines community is welcoming and we all help each other.Also, if this review influenced you to buy the game, please comment. I would like to see how many people I helped.Sincerely,BOT Harvey			"

												This is a great game.And this is a review in progress.---- 5 hours mark ----My main reasons for recommendation are:1. It's built upon existing knowledge from SimCity series: developer (Colossal Order) takes account of both success and failure of SimCity.2. One can see what future improvement to this game entails: good modding support gives developer better insight into what players want.3. A new era for city-building game. Cities Skylines isn't perfect (eg. rough UI, lack of goals, confusing public transport, rudimentary map editor, missing your favorite type of roads, etc etc), but it shows us what's achievable, with SimCity series back on hiatus, Cities Skylines is the new standard.The future for Cities Skylines is bright, will add more comments as I play.

												The good: - Ridiculously large amount of workshop content, adding more things to build, ways to customize and other things- Great building mechanics- Simple to use yet very useful UI- Enormous world size - several times that of any other games- Huge amount of things to customize and ways to customize them- Regular updates and plenty of support- Great amount of ways to affect the city without building, eg. managing economy (it's essential and mildly complex but easy to work with when you get used to it)- Good graphics (or, better than most games of the same type)Negatives:- If you build a big city, you're going to have difficulty with FPS as the traffic and people will butcher your PC (however powerful!) That said, as long as you don't zoom too far into the rodas, you can maintain a steady FPS with most mid-range PC's.Absolutely recommend this game as the best City Builder ever made.			"

+ Extremely addicting gameplay.  Honestly, this is the type of game you can play all day without getting bored as build a vibrant city. + Easy to learn with very intuitive menues, and features that slowly unlock as your city builds. There really isn't need for any tutorials, you will learn as you play.+ Visually the game looks gorgeous, and it is a delight to go into camera-mode and just watch as your city thrives. You can even see your people as they go about their daily tasks. What is most surprising is the variety of buildings / houses / stores that are built, and they all look great.+ Day / Night Cycle and Weather to add a further sense of emersion.+ Challenging, you have a budget which you have to constantly keep an eye on. Every so often you will have growing pains, where you may suddenly run out of power or water, or perhaps a building will catch on fire, or perhaps the crime rate goes up or you run out of garbage trucks, or maybe a giant traffic jam. You have to be ready to deal with all these issues and more while trying to manage a steady tax rate and keep people from getting unhappy and moving out.+ You can buy addional plots of land and build multiple HUGE thriving cities+ Steam Workshop with a bunch of new buildings and scenerios- The biggest disappointment for me is the lack of pre-build scenerios or ""challenge levels / missions"". The main goal seems to be to just grow as large you possibly can, and then start over.- The road system could be improved a bit. It's a bit difficult to make neat and uniform roads with proper exits. On top of this, building various road types and highways is VERY expensive making it difficult to improve areas with dense congested traffic.Side Note: If you were wondering, Yes this game is far greater than Sim City			"

												This is pretty much all I wanted in a city sim since I put down Sim City 4.I'm a bit of a dinosaur in that I still prefer the isometric pixel art of yore, and Cities: Skylines has a more ""clean/cartoon"" art style than I'd like. But apart from that, it pretty much gets everything right. The UI is easy, functional, and still manages to be deep. Systems seem both complex and accessible.I've enjoyed it for hours out of the box, I'm looking forward to player mods, and the future expansions and add-ons. I think this one's a long-term keeper!

												This game is what I wanted. This game is what I needed. This game is what SimCity should have been, it is a perfect sequel to SimCity; it's what all of us weirdos that love citybuilders have been begging for. This game is like cocaine, it is a drug to me now...I can't stop playing this game.This game takes city builders, then somehow manages to add a whole layer of depth beyond what I thought was possible. The extra policies, districts, industrial zone types, and various other features come together so perfectly, I honestly am in constant shock how everything ebbs and flows so well in an orchestra of harmony. This game is completely bug free (so far), has the production value of a AAA studio, beautiful music, pretty graphics, mod support, extremely well optimized, and water physics (for awesome some reason).I have not played a game I thoroughly enjoyed in probably 2 years; until this game came along. I am so happy I finally have a game I can enjoy once again. Thank you Paradox, thank you.Seriously, if you love citybuilders or strategy games, GET THIS. "

												Its the City Builder I have wanted for years. Thank you Colossal Order, and Paradox! +It runs really well on low end PCs+it has mod support out of the box+tons of stuff on the workshop already+traffic works really well (Its hard as hell at times)+it has a built in hard mode mod for us crazy people+map builder+sandbox mode-I wish I could build over roads with upgraded roads rather then deleting every road bit-Game slows down a TON when you save.-I had game freezeing problems when playing in windowed mode.I have a few small fixable problems and with promoused DLC and updates, I can see myself playing this for a long time.Thumbs up.

												This game is what i always wanted in a city builder. From the times of the original Simcity i have been wanting to walk around in my creation. Simcopter made an attempt butit was to far ahead of its time and failed. And now comes allong Cities:Skyline. This game has so much detail you can follow a single person around. He will go to work,chill at a park, play on his tablet in his back yard or on his balconey. And then you zoom out to a City on the scale of mexico city or new york. its enough to get lost for hours at a time. In adition to the amazing vanillla features, the game has full mod support so you can add first person mod,new houses even add tiny props the size of a flower pot. The game itself is extremely robust. i have been downloading random mods giving no thought on compatibility so i can see how the game handles mods. i only started to get problems when i reached page 40 on my mod list. And that stability under mods is the best i have seen in any game. Take Arma 3 for instance. here is a game that was build with modding in mind and that game starts to get game breaking issues once the number of mods break the 20 mod number. This leaves the game open to create your perfect city.dont have a house you want. make it.Put that all together and you have without a doubt in my mind the best city builder game the world has ever seen.

												So I say to myself, why write a review, when I can fake quotes from other people?""Game is credit to team!"" ~ TF2 Heavy""This is our land!"" ~ CS:GO T""I did not have relations with that dev"" ~ Clinton... yeah, maybe not.By now you've probably seen other reviews saying that Cities: Skylines beats the pants of the comparitive SimCity and the Cities XL / XXL. So I won't rehash that.What I like about Cities: Skylines It's relaxed There are a huge number of community content additions to the game Roads, zoning, sevices etc are all easy to apply (there is a learning curve) Since I've owned the game, there have still been official updates & content additions June 2016 saw a small free DLC pack Expansion of territory is simple Apart from the stock unlimited money mod, you can get a first person one too, allowing you to wander about You can rename anything. Everything has default names, but you can rename people, dogs, areas, housing etcWhat I don't like about Cities: SkylinesI have tried to think of counter points to the above, something negative, but I can't really name any. There are a few missteps I made in my first few games - such as planning / designing areas in a tightly aranged format, preventing easy upgrades to roads. But that's part of the learning curve I mentioned above. There's really been nothing bad about the game at all. There has been one oddity / amusing gaff: a road twisting when elevated, cornering too tightly, and positioned too close to last point - but that's the only thing.One thing I would like to suggest to the devs, is to make the single-instance trees to have more of an effect (an effect?) on noise pollution.Gameplay Note: You may be tempted to build all up on your high way access. Don't. You will rue the day you did that. Think space. You don't need to cram things in.			"

												This game is dangerous. First off, the Developers are very active so you know the game is not going to stagnate and bugs aren't going to last forever. Second, the community is very strong. Wish there was something in the game? There is probably a mod to cover you. Third, just 5 more minutes. OK, five more. What if I demolish this area and put in high density and then wrap the roads over here... Whoa, is that the time?			"

												The first, sorry for my bad english, because english is not my mother language.this review i made because im so excited about this game (specially a game to build city like this).like :-this game its so cheap (just 200k IDR = 17$)-what i like is, this game have a good texture and detail. (building, road with traffic light, car, and manny more)-we can build a big city (with help from mod)-the gameplay is really simple, and without bug (i never have a problem with bug until now without additional mod)-we can adds mods, or texture and etc, from workshop for your city. (so manny we can choose it and its make more fun)dislike :-the gameplay is simple, because that we really need a mods to make more fun-some a mod, is not conformable with other mod (its not worked)-no night time in the game (its so sad to know this, i wish the development to update night time)until now, its so fun to play this game. i recommended to you buy, its really worth, just 17$			"

												I absolutely LOVE this game.  I'm an old SimCity player who killed hundreds of hours back in the day playing SC before it was ruined by EA.  Cities: Skylines is the game I've been waiting for for a decade!  It's been a joy learning to play it, developing my city building strategies, and building MY city.The icing on the cake for me, is when I'm waiting for my budget to generate enough money to implement my next improvement or build, I can pick out a citizen, and follow them around.  Doing this gives me insight into how I can make my city a better place for that citizen to live in...whether it's improving the transit system, putting in some commercial zones closer to their house, etc.  Being able to see real citizens going about their day to day tasks from cradle to grave is amazing.I bought this game based on the early positive reviews I read, and I have nothing but praise to add to them.  I won't be surprised if this ends up as GOTY...no doubt it will be a nominee.  I haven't been this excited about a simulation in a LONG time!			"

												An addictive, time-stealing game that has city building true to the core. Worthy of the hype, steep and enjoyble learning curve. Steam workshop is brimming with interesting additions to your city. You, yourself, can alter the appearance of any building to your tastes. You can truly build anything to match your imagination.My only gripe is the fact my save files and ultimately my mega city errored and I lost that. Don't know what happened but this game is so much fun that starting from the ground up again is very enjoyable.10/10 would play until 4am again.			"

												Traffic Simulator 2015. OCD Simulator 2015. Ambulance Simulator 2015. Trash Piling Up Simulator 2015. Loan Simulator 2015. Still a better love story than SimCity.No, but really. This game IS GREAT, I however suck at it which should in no means deter anyone from buying it. My roads suck, I can't make an circular roundabout ramp to save my life, I named one of my districts ""Trash Town"" because all they ever do is complain about how their trash is piling up even though I BUILT 5 ♥♥♥♥IN INCINERATORS NEXT TO THEM.  But, I still have a ton of fun ♥♥♥♥ing up my city. I never will second guess my decision to not become a city planner. Whether you are an OCD architect king or your town turns into a traffic filled, trash overflowing mess like my town, it's guaranteed that this game will keep you endless entertained and inspired to make your town not suck as much ♥♥♥ little by little for endless amounts of time.I am soooo thankful for day 1 workshop in this game, people have already generated game changings mods, worlds, buildings, and most of all pre made intersections (thank you cities skylines baby jesus)Everyone keeps asking ""IS IT BETTER THAN SIMS CITY?!"" and YES. IT IS. I played the newest version of SimCity a day before release to kind of compare it to before I played this one.. The controls are so much more difficult to learn and understand, it feels clunkier and messier and in general like you have less to do and less control of the game. I am so impressed with the simplicity, beauty, and user friendly format that cities skylines has to offer.It has already showed to be immensely popular to both play and watch others build masterpieces or piles of dirt on twitch. Something about this game is just so freakin' good.For a $30 price tag, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who has any interest in building or simulation games. You will love this game!! 10/10 :)			"

												When I was a child, I had a dog growing up. She was a golden retriever named Sparkey and she was the best damn dog a kid could ever have. Was she perfect? No. She would seek out and consume cat poop and begged at the table when we tried to have dinner, but I didn't care. She was an awesome dog and I spent hours playing with her. Near the end of her life, her liver shut down. She started to ♥♥♥♥ and puke in the house, and even started to snap at me; she was in a lot of pain. In the end the vet suggested we put her down. It was a sad day. I had lost a best friend that I had for years, but it was for the best. Later we got a new dog. A Yellow Lab/German Shepard mix named Milo. Milo was not Sparky, but he is still an awesome dog. Playful, good with kids, cutely vocal and a big lump who's good for hugging. He isn't perfect either, he sheds like crazy, but that doesn't make him a bad dog. Why did I ramble on about dogs? The Sim City Franchise is Sparkey, with 5imCity 2013 being her post liver-failure. A game series I remember fondly as the stuff of my childhood, willfully editing out what happened at the very end. Cities: Skylines is Milo. A new dog, a different dog, but an awesome dog. If you are a fan of city building games at all, you are going to want to pick this game up right now. It is only $30 AT LAUNCH. That is not a sale price, that is the full undiscounted price and it is worth double that (which, by the way, is what 5imCity 2013 cost at launch). It is stable and fun out of the box and with adamant mod support and a dev team that is actively listening to the community feedback, it will get even better.  "

												This is what i would call the ""cream-of-the-crop"" city simulation building game. Coming from the SimCity series, i must say i was truly impressed by the openess of this game. The mods. The supports. The game itself. My tears has been wiped dry. For SGD55 it has given me countless hours in trying to replicate a seamless city. 378 hours and still counting. Truly amazing. With that said, the king ""SimCity"" has ben dethroned. This is the new king! The new benchmark in city simulation. The new yardstick!!! Ps - I've read some negative reviews about this game. No doubt there are some bugs and issues that need sorted out by the devs. No game is perfect. Give it time and it will be the best city builder game by far. Another major complain was that this game focus is more towards modding. As a city builder game you want variety of buildings, roadways, vehicle and etc. And that is where the modding community shines. It adds flavour to the game. I'm sure you will get bored of the plain 'ol vanilla building made by the devs sooner or later. And when i scrolled through the bad reviews something caught my attention. I'd say 80% of them have raked up on average of 30 hours on the game. That's just not fair. Each to their own then.			"

												Only one word:  AWESOME I own the game for 1.5 years now and I'm still not tired of it. There are  TONS and TONS  of mods and assets you can download on the workshop.  If the game is on sale:   and you love simcity and haven't bought this game,  buy it. It is worth  every  penny! :)  If the game isn't on sale:   and you love simcity and haven't bought this game, buy it. It is worth  every  penny! :)   or wait for a sale :D  I'do only think there needs to be a transportation DLC which needs to include: cargo planes with big terminals etc., ferries, more in depth transportation options, more vehicles, more roads, etc.then it will be even more awesme! :-)  EDIT:  mass transit is coming!

												Well this game is a strange one. To sum it up: If you only want to design a nice looking city you'll probably like this game. But if you want to build a city and to deal with challenging problems in this city you'll probably be bored very soon, because the game mechanics are too simple and not challenging at all. In my point of view this is mainly caused by the following issues: Traffic: Probably the only challenging problem within your city. It's ok or even a little bit too low within downtown but much too high in industrial districts. Furthermore traffic jams are often caused by the stupid AI. You'll spend much time optimizing it by building additional roads, railroads, bus lines and so on. But then again - there are almost no penalities for having a bad traffic system. Only if the traffic becomes too bad growables won't get enough resources, which again causes your citizens to abandon them. Pollution: It has only a range of one or two blocks around your industrial areas. You only may not build residentals in this area. If you do so you'll never have any problems with pollution in your city. Energy: You can build several different powerplants. Which ones you'll choose is almost completely irrelevant and just a matter of MW per $. For example: There aren't any calms, so it isn't risky powering your city with only wind energy. Coal energy generates much pollution, but then again pollution only has a range of one or two blocks. . . . . . City-Services (Crime/ Fire/ Health/ Education/ Deathcare/ Leisure/ Garbage): Just build one of these buildings here and there and your growables will be all happy. There's almost no need for a clever placement of those buildings. Growables: Achieving the highest levels for all of your growables is easy, because the level mainly depends on the amount of city services, which are in the neighborhood of this building.  Tourism: It is still completely broken. You cannot focus on tourism, because there are never enough tourists visiting your city. Resource chain and industrial production: They are also very simple. Basic resources (oil, food, ore) are transformed into general goods which are transported to your commercials and then bought by your citizens. You cannot specialize into anything, like car industry or hightech industry, here.Zoning: You almost don't need any strategy for placing your zones well or choosing a good ratio. Just avoid building too much industrials because of the traffic jams and your city probably will be fine. There's almost no variety like ways of specialization here. So appending new blocks to your city becomes pretty boring after a while. Income: You will never know how well your city works, since this game automatically tries to adjust the tax income of your growables, so that your total net income is somewhere between 10 000 $ or 20 000 $. This adjustment only fails if your expenses are much too high. Disasters: Not really available in this game. There are just fires. They don't even spread and only destroy a single building if the fire fighters don't arrive fast enough.I could still continue with this list for a while. But at least in my view the above mentioned flaws within the game mechanics are the most important ones. So I'll stop here. There are also some minor issues with the graphics (scales of growables are wrong) and with the GUI (placing roads and bus lines often becomes tedious). But I could easily forgive those issues if the basic game mechanics were better.			"

My Opinion of Cities: SkylinesCities: Skylines is simply an amazing city building game. I remember playing Sims City 4 Deluxe Edition and thinking of how good it was, this game may have surpassed it's greatness. This game released a little over two years after the disaster that was Sims City 5. Picture everything wrong with that game, then think of the exact opposite and you have Cities: Skylines.    Pros- Very good graphics.- The little details (building signs, people biking, store fronts, etc).- Few repetitive buildings in close proximity, looks more realistic. - The traffic system (yes, it has some positives but I'll address the negatives in the cons below).- Day/Night cycle, it almost seems to change the whole look of your city. - Well optimized. - Frequent updates and patches. - Water physics. Cons- Traffic will stay in one lane even if it is a 6 lane highway. What is the point of having different road types if your citizens use one lane? It is not a deal breaker for this game, but it does pull you out of the fantastic city environment Paradox Interactive worked so hard to make. - Maybe 2-3 crashes within my small time played. It's not really an issue but I thought I would list it.  My Verdict: 7/10 (If the issues with the traffic are fixed it is easily a 8/10)			"

												Cities: Skylines.... Where do I start. I have played this game for what does it say, 18 hours or something like that? I dont even know anymore. The reason I do not know anymore is because when you start playing Skylines hours in real life seem to just disappear. You can start for the first time at 8 pm and not even realize it is now well past midnight.You start your city with nothing but an in an out road. Maybe a Train track. You build, you develop neighborhoods, commercial areas, and industrial areas just like in all the SimCity games. Eventually you get enough people to buy an expansion slot which allows you to make your city bigger, and bigger and bigger until eventually you have this huge map that seems like there is no end to it. The only grip I would say I have about this game is that there is a max amount of expansion slots you can buy for your city. Which I guess is alright, but it would be nice if you could just keep going and going. Then again I dont know how well that would work or even if you could keep up with maintaining the whole city from Burned Down buildings or abandonded buildings, or making sure there are enough Cemetarys in your city to go an pick up all the dead bodies each day. Do I recommend this game? ♥♥♥♥ yeah.			"

												I've read it before and I'll say it again... This is what Sim City should have been.  I sat down thinking, ""It'll be fun, but I'll do something else in about an hour.""  Nope.  THIS is I remember Sim City series used to be like.  If you're on the fence about this game, GET IT.  You won't be disappointed.  If you're considering a certain game from EA, stop here and get this game.  I believe the developers have reignited the excitement of this genre.  I can't wait for what they do in the future.			"

												[Disclosure: This was reviewed due to a review copy provided by Paradox]After 2013’s debacle that was Sim City it was time some new devs stepped to the table. Cities XXL was a huge miss as Focus Interactive did nothing to improve their terrible running and clunky game so the question is, did Colossal Order (a Paradox dev responsible for Cities in Motion) deliver? Yes, oh my god Yes!Cities Skylines is another game in the long list of city building and managing simulators that have been trying to succeed in the shoes of what was Sim City 4; released more than 12 years ago. From the dev that created Cities in Motion, Colossal Order does something that no other city sim has done and make a truly great game that brings back the feel of Sim City 4 and my favorite of the series, Sim City 3000. They brought it back to its basics which included zones, different building types like electrical, water, fire, police, medical, fun and even the unique landmark buildings.When you start creating your city you start in a small 2km x 2km square that can expand as your city gets bigger and you annex other areas to a possible 25 tile, 100km2 area (with the support of a mod that is already in the steam workshop). The game also locks different building, zones, etc. behind population goals so that it isn’t too overwhelming however there are mods that allow you to unlock everything to start if you wish along with unlimited money. The game will also allow for steam workshop when it releases for people to create their own user content to add to the game which could include more buildings, new modes, user made cities and much more.Along with the buildings and zones there are also the financial and policies that make a city sim a true city sim. They are simple enough and not as annoying as was the advisors in sim city 3000 but they change things greatly including outlawing private traffic in certain zones forcing people to take mass transit instead. What those policies and other specific buildings do is increase the happiness of the people in the commercial, residential and industrial zones. As your happiness increases they are more likely to accept higher taxes and recommend more people to move in causing an increase in desire for residential and other financial zones. I can also say that Colossal Order certainly know how to make their transport lines work and work well because every form of transportation was easy to create and maintain.That being said the roads themselves were difficult to make sure they were right especially having off ramps connect to highways. When I bought my first annex there was a highway running through it. I thought it would have been easy enough to figure out how to implement a overpass/rounded off ramp to have access to the other side of the highway however I had to do a lot of work to get a new one working. First I had to delete the existing off ramps and highway to make way for a 4 way off ramp. On top of that in order to make sure a one way road/highway continues to go one way, instead of detecting which way automatically the roads go you to build the road in the same direction traffic would flow. Took me about 15 minutes to realize this. Hopefully it’ll be something they patch after release because I can imagine it’ll be something some people will complain about.One other complaint, and maybe it is something I’m not used to due to the simplicity of zones in Sim City 3000, I don’t like the way zones sit for  “squares” off the road for each road you make. I’m more of a fan of dragging and dropping to make a zone like it was in SC 3000. That is just a personal preference. However all you can do with the roads is quite impressive and though I did play this game quite a bit I wasn’t able to play it enough to truly design a city that looked great.Now this game looks quite impressive and the buildings are quite varied enough to make the cities and areas look unique. Mod support and steam workshop is only going to improve the variety of buildings after release. The engine runs smooth, however capped at 60 fps (not that you really need more since this isn’t a action moving game), and looks great. The UI is clean and they actually made a change to it as I was playing my review copy in the last week.The sound isn’t anything spectacular, however it is there and does work well with what the game is. If you zoom in to roads you can hear cars going by, if you do the same for various areas you hear what you would expect to hear if you were walking on the street. The ambient music also makes it nice to listen to while you are designing away. So nothing over the top but fits quite well.Overall, Cities Skylines, I feel, is truly the best city sim game since Sim City 4 and in fact is better than 4. It has everything that you could want in a city building game; large building areas, variety in design and buildings, unique challenges in building and managing and a great looking engine.  This is a must in my opinion for anyone that was looking for the next good city builder especially those that like to play in offline mode.Review with screenshots: http://fg-2.com/2015/03/10/review-cities-skylines/ "

												The best city builder that we can play currently. It is relatively easy but it has all the features we need to be satisfied. It has modding support and you can create different maps and assets in the editor. Its one of those games where you start playing and then turn around and realize you have no idea how much time has passed.Definitely recommend it to everyone who wants to be a mayor.My gameplay and tutorial videos for the game can be seen below:

												The city builder we need and deserve after all these years and especially after the crime that was the last Sim City. It's a bit rough around a few courners, but basically a fully functional game with a lot of fun. Collossal Order stated that they're going to support the game like Paradox does with Crusader Kings II. I am looking forward to play this game and seeing the developers and modders build on the solid foundations. Sim City is dead, long live Skylines!			"

												Yeah it's a bit late for a review - but I'm glad I'm writing one now as had I written it at release it would have been full of praise as a must buy game...Thing is, almost a year later this game still has a ton of irritating bugs that you absolutely must install mods for. I could deal with that - except the mods are poorly supported and very frequently break with patches leaving you with useless save games.I could even deal with that - if the patches that  the developer was putting out were fixing major issues. Thing is..they haven't. CO seems to have forgotten about the many annoyances of this game and been happy to let the modding community sort them out.Unfortunately it seems that many of the issues that this game suffers from just have not been adequately addressed by mods. Traffic is a complete nightmare with the AI behaving oddly and as such designing a high density city is incredibly tedious as you will spend 99% of your time fighting with traffic.Ok - fine, we can say that the traffic is the core challenge of skylines as really beyond that the game is trivially simple - but even that turns into hours of frustration as the tools you have for building roads are amazingly clunky. Some of the most popular mods are ways of disabling pillars, road intersection angle limitations and slope limitations for roads - but even those mods are tedious to use as you have a very clunky interface for building roads and no built in teraforming tools. The mods that do exist are clunky to use or result in incredibly ugly and unrealistic looking roads.These are all issues that have been listed from day one - so where are we a year later? Same place of course! CO has released a pair of unimpressive DLCs which are mostly cosmetic and at times annoying. After Dark does not add much except tunnels that is of any use and the night mode is just another layer of frustration as building at night is difficult - unless you get that mod that lights up your mouse cursor. Snowfall adds trams which are basically expensive buses with no other advantages that I can see - there is effectively no real reason to use them besides aesthetics as metro and buses get the job done better and easier.  Heated pipes offer little change in the game.So here we are - a year later and the game still feels like it needs ~30 essential mods to enjoy and even that enjoyment is basically fighting with the road building system for 2 hours to build a single good looking and working highway off-ramp.I really want to love this game but every single time I play it I feel more drained and frustrated by it than my day job.

												I was always interested in city building games, even if only on the level of mapping the streets and zoning.After the infamous flop of SimCity 2013, Cities Skylines just appeared out of the blue to take over most of the internet, as one of the most comprehensive and high quality modern city simulators around.Thanks to the After Dark update, the game looks positively gorgeous. Sure, the models and textures are quite poor up close, but the game wasn't designed to be viewed from a pedestrian's perspective, despite the (admittedly awesome) first person mods. But simply looking towards the horizon, above your city, it's magical.The music is cheerful - repetitive a bit, but cheerful and fits the bustling city atmosphere. Chirper starts off as a nice way to learn from your citizens how your city's faring, then becomes grating with the same tweets being given off about cats rescued by fire detectors, or how nice a place the city is. The rest of the sounds nail the busy metropolis theme.Gameplay is stellar, and very, very strategic. You lay down roads of various widths, then zone out areas for either residential, commercial or industrial buildings. Put down a coal plant, or several wind turbines, and deliver power to the masses. Set up the water pumping station and the sewage dumps - but be careful not to leave sewage upstream of the pumping station. Lay down services, such as medical clinics, fire stations, police stations, landfills and so on, and make sure they get as much coverage as possible. Create leisure zones, parks and other attractions, reduce noise and pollution, and allow for decent public services, to improve land value and level up buildings. Expand as your city does.The degree of simulation is such that you can follow individual ""cims"" walking out of their house, to their car, driving through junctions (and maybe getting caught in the infamous jams), reach their workplace or education facility, spend some time there, then return home. Every single citizen has a little schedule to follow. The water, which you can channel through a dam to power your city, is fully simulated, and badly placed dams and waterfront protection can cause flooding, which is not exactly good for your city. Traffic is the player's biggest threat - if you don't plan way, way ahead what you're doing, you are going to grind your city to a halt.The modding community is fantastic, providing addons ranging from highway interchanges and junction types, to new buildings, to enhanced AI logic, simulation, traffic actions and so on.It is a huge rush wildly flailing in panic at the sight of multiple problems occuring across the city, almost entirely due to poor traffic flow, and so is the relief that comes after successfully dealing with said situation.I really like this game. You ought to play it.			"

												First of all, I had very high expectations, and that's never a good thing. Secondly, I played SimCity 4: Rush Hour until today.Now I don't have to, because I have Cities: Skylines, which is truly a successor of it.PROs:- Road-engineering is really next-gen!- The graphics/physics are not just good, but feature cool/cute details too (for example, when a truck ramps on a highway, it bounces a bit)- I love the water/wind simulation (besides it is just a very small part of the game)- People-based simulation is fascinating, and even over 40.000 population the game runs perfectly- The different map layers look good, and are useful - The game is almost bug-free on day one! (Hello EA, I am waving at you)- Map size is small at the beginning, but can be expanded later, at the end is somewhat the same size as the 4x4 in SimCity 4, which is huge (EA? Are you still here?)- Mod and custom asset support!CONs:- It is hard and easy at the same time. Let me explain: to make a perfect traffic in a big city is almost impossible, if you don't want to destroy everything and make your city a big highway intersection (which I am not a fan of). On the other hand, keeping everything in terrible traffic have no consequences at all! I think this is bad, because the game doesn't reward you if you make a good traffic. I have just watched a stream when a guy used only dirty roads in his city over 40.000 pop, and the city worked perfectly. In SimCity 4, when you do this, people moves out of their homes, because the commute time is so high, and so the offices/commercial/industry will fall too. I really hope they will fix this.- The public transportation has some issues too. According to my experiences, only buses can be operated profitable. Also, train traffic is ridiculous: even a metropolis should have less train-traffic, and most of them operate nearly empty (10/240 passengers or so).- I am not a big fan of working cities with only skyscapers. In SimCity 4, when you zone high density residential, but people feel they don't want to live in a mega-block, they will build some low-dense housing instead. Like in a normal city. Here, you zone high-everything, and they just build a Manhattan in the middle of nothing. But overall this is a great game, and I highly recommend it! Also, I am quite sure they will fix all the bugs and consider changing some of the cons I mentioned. Happy gaming!			"

												Even though this is a negative review, it comes with a caveat. I want challenge and simulation out of a strategy or management game, and Cities: Skylines does not provide that. If you like just building a nice city then you'll love Cities: SkylinesSort of like Planet Coaster, Cities is basically just a map painter. You can't literally do whatever you want but you would be hard-pressed to come up against any challenge beyond screwing up traffic configurations. You'll never run out of money and never run up against a fail state that you either didn't bring upon yourself on purpose or that you didn't see coming a mile away.I'm really disappointed in this title. Lots of people love it so I'm assuming that I made a mistake in not reading into the game enough before purchasing it. However, I just want to warn anyone who is looking for a good challenge to stay away.			"

												Just buy it (on sale if you're not sure)... So much talent and passion behind this game.  The technical complexity of the simulation is amazing, the pricing is perfectly on point.  Checkout the workshop and have your mind blown.The DLC in my opinion is a way for the developers to reward themselves further of the blood, sweat, and tears they pour into this game.  People often forget that when a DLC comes out, the base game receives free huge content updates and back-end fixes, extended mod support, etc.   The DLC often go on sale as well just like the base game.  You may have paid $60 for SimCity 5 for a water-downed simulation/pretty game.. So far I've spent ~$30 total with all DLCs and this game has added more enjoyment than all city sims before it combined..

After 10 hoursThis has been a very pleasant city simulator so far in big part due to the user-friendly user interface and mechanics. The city is a joy to build, prod and tweak and you only need a few keys and your mouse buttons. While many good lessons have been learned from mobile gaming (simple menu structures, addictive feedback FX, hint stream, etc.), the game offers a good amount of depth, freedom and player challenge. The city will grow automatically but not run itself and will certainly need a strategist and grand architect. The player's role is as it should be: balancing, optimising and developing the city, not monitoring every last building and citizen, yet you still can if you want to! Speaking of, the citizens behave in a consistent and logical manner (if not an entirely rational one, but that is arguably good simulation!), making the city feel alive and controllable.tl;dr - Fun to play, full mechanics, satisfies tweakers, AI is good.The Steam Workshop support brings a massive boost to the content just weeks after release: if you struggle with building intersections like I do, there are dozens, even hundreds of ready-made and user-tested Workshop ones available! No more eternal gridlock! There are also buildings, decorations and all sorts of stuff if the basic selection gets too repetitive. The default selection is nicely finished and has a good level of detail.tl;dr - Steam Workshop provides ideas, help and variety.The only negatives so far are the pretty limited soundtrack, not enough variety in Chirper messages, no road ruler (grid), and the Steam Workshop items are missing their thumbnails. These are minor inconveniences so far and two can be circumvented; play your own music and keep a manageable number of content installed so you know what is what. The roads do snap straight, but sometimes it is not clear when they do, and different angles are hard to produce accurately.All in all a great experience so far, and I haven't seen half the content yet!PS. Compared to SimCity? Better flow, nicer UI mechanics, less obtuse, better mod and community support - and no EA/Origin! There is a Paradox account you can register, but it is not mandatory. I don't know how the performance will be once my city reaches beyond two map squares, but so far there have been no slowdowns or glitches.After 24 hoursStill going strong; the game has switched focus from pure growth to efficiency and large-scale management. I still get to build simple and fun new places (these maps feel pretty huge), but the core of the city is now an optimiser's dream. Education, roadworks and public transit are a real balancing act.I still can't get enough even after failing two cities miserably - they just feel like learning experiences. My main city is a place I constantly want to go back to and build and improve.The engine shows no signs of slowing down or glitching even with four (or was it five) map squares built, and game load times are fantastic. No real bugs or glitches in sight, everything Just Works. Except Tweeter; that thing is really starting to annoy me, because it has no relevance or variety anymore.Still very much Recommended.			"

 Over 300 hours enough said ALL PROBLEMS I LIST ARE FIXED BY MODS  Nighttime is nice. But the speciality of areas to section into your city seem lacking. However my biggest issue is no shock here. Taxis. I thought the taxis would work like buses jut spawning the needed amount for the area or route. Nope Taxis are a limited number. Making them nothing but flash for your roads and never making the expense money back. It seems that with more they add to the game the more the games traffic isses become more bothersome. Yes I can fix it with mods. However, I say I shouldnt have to. Because this game was made by the same dev that made City in motion. So clearly they have an understanding of what a city needs to run. However, they seem to have cut that out in this as in transport that has diffrent type of mass transport and effectivness in this game. The game seems to be designed for a road/highway based city. And any other methods bedamed. Which I personally find very not upset just wishing it was better. Tunnels add a new useful way to manage roads/highways. However the tunnels are not labeled so over time underground ends up looking like the L.A. freeways system but underground.Further there is not enough detailed information. Industry will complain about not having enough resources. However there is no way to just add the import costs to the city expenses. Which is very confusing because there are city view overlays that show trucks driving to industry with imports. It seems that over time the industries are not able to order more imports. This problem also effects office/commercial these sectors also lose the ability to get the goods needed to function. Moreover, If you connect industry to office/comm industry for a time sends the needed goods to the formerly mentioned sectors. Alas the mentioned issues mean that after a time the problems kick in so massive amounts of these sectors are abandoned. So you will have to delete large sections of those sectors. Moving on to transport it works by placing lines in the path you want it to go and press the  line to place the stop. That is how the game explains it to you however that it is very messy to place many lines on bus and trains/subway. Traffic is another big problem. And can not be fixed without placing messy lines of highway making your city look like the L.A. freeway system. Oh and the cars on the highway drive like ♥♥♥♥ cutting each other off and slowing down the other cars in the lanes. No matter how many subways or buses or trains I place in hotspots. People still use their cars. After playing the game for another 100+ hours my traffic controling skills are better so after about 90,000 people in my city THEN the trafic goes to poop. However this game is not marketed as a grand city builder just a basic one. So it shouldnt have taken me and extra 100 hours to get a handle on the traffic and mass transport. Moding is highly easy for this game I still find myself using very little ""big"" mods other than road intersections and what not because heavy mods make my game crash.   ALL PROBLEMS i LISTED ARE FIXED BY MODS, STILL BETTER THAN SIMCITY5 !!! "

												Setup a ""Recreational Use"" drug policy on my residential district. Best. Game. Ever.In all seriousness though, this game is a great city builder. Better than Sim City 2013 and much better than the last two Cities XL games. There is mod support right away, you can expand your city to be much much larger, the gameplay is fun, it handles well, runs well and its a blast to play. Sure the art design could be better (seems like a cheap sc 2013 style art design), sure I miss the night and day cycle from SC and there are some bugs with drivers ai and some other stuff but overall those pale compared to all the things this game does right. Want to create a big gigantic city? You have come to the right game!Get your hands on this wonderfully crafted game and you won't be dissapointed. There is alot of options for customization, I can see hundreds of hours being spent on this game down the road, well done devs! Two big thumbs up from me, as this is the most fun I have had building stuff in a videogame since Simcity 4 and the last Anno game. This is a wonderful base game as is and for the future, I can see mods and expansion packs adding more and more down the road to.			"

												This is the city builder people wanted back in 2013. Not to be confused with the Cities XL series, this game is done by the same people who did Cities In Motion. I finally have a good city builder to play other than SimCity 4.- In depth traffic simulation/planning. You can build your own interchanges/intersections/pretty much anything from scratch, and the AI will realistically follow it.- Mod support (Steam Workshop enabled too). The developers even endorse modding. Does EA even know what modding is anymore?- NO DRM! Yes yes, I know, SimCity doesnt need to always be online anymore. But this game has no DRM other than the cd key you get on Steam.- HUGE maps. You start with a small plot of land, but are able to purchase neighboring plots as your city grows. This means you can have a sprawling metropolis with multiple town centers/airports/highway systems.- The ability to divide your city in to separate districs, each able to have their own policies/taxes.If you are on the fence about this game, definitely go for it. For only $30 at release, it is an excellent price for a game that will keep you entertained for a long, long time. "

												Less than 2 weeks I have owned Skylines, already 50+ hours of fun building, already I've hit that nirvana of losing time as I tinker with some piece of my city. There are not the proper words to express how much this game blows the most recent iteration of SimCity out of the water. I know I'll easy log 500+ hours on this game over the next year - and for $30! I would've felt it well-purchased at $50.The road building tools actually function, the pathfinding isn't stupid, the city size is larger than I've needed so far, and the tools to micro-manage exist without requiring use.Value, fun, and only the beginning.

												If you like City Builders, this is the game for you.  And if you banged your head against the abortion that was the last SimCity game hoping against hope that Maxis would stop lying to its customers and just fix the damned thing then you're really in for a treat.  This is what SimCity *should* have been -- large expandable maps, better tools and options, you name it.  In fact there really isn't a lot that SimCity got wrong that this one doesn't get right, which you would assume (and hope) is a thumb in EA's eye.			"

												My first week I was very into Cities:Skylines. But then I quickly realized this game is not a city sim or even city builder/designer game. No, its pure traffic sim. You will lose yourself for hours trying to fix the idiotic AI that is Cities:Skylines traffic. Drivers will only drive in the center lane near an exit ramp. This creates chaos. They will come to a dead stop with two other clear lanes but no one will drive in the other lanes. I'm convinced this is not by design, but a bug due to poor AI. Why have six lanes or a three lane highway if the sims are not going to utilize the lanes during heavy traffic. Also, a town of 50,000 is not going to have enough population or demand to clog up a 3 lane one way highway(total of six lanes), let alone the 2 connecting highways on my map, and then a third highway I built.To add to this chaos, garbage collectors, cops, firemen, hearst drivers, etc, do not stay in their own area. They will abandon their area and go clog your highways while your citizens near the service home suffer. There is no AI to make them only stay in their area. Even if you have every area covered they will still go across your map.The only challenge to this game is making an entire city with no traffic stops - nothing else is a challenge. Even with well executed roundabouts you're still going to have extreme highway challenges that all orginate from 1) too much traffic being spawned despite a low population, 2) poor AI because sims do not utilize highways correctly. At first, I found it fun to try and beat the traffic, until I realize I've spent hours on it, and have noticed the sims erratic, pointless driving. Its just poor AI. I'm sure there are other traffic sims that have proper AI, not that I even wanted a traffic sim, I was hoping for a city builder/designer. So, unless you want a frustrating traffic sim game, with a bity of city builder thrown in I would say only get this if its on sale. And do not bother with the overpriced DLC. If they fix the traffic AI, then it'd be a fun little game.Also, another unrealistic aspect is you can follow a car, and in good traffic it will take this car days to reach its destination. In bad traffic it will take weeks... C'mon. Regardless, just a poor traffic sim game.			"

												Much as I prefer to let each game stand on its own, certain games demand comparisons. In the case of Cities: Skylines, developer Colossal Order has overtly modeled its game after SimCity – not just the fundamental concept and methods of building and maintaining a simulated city from the ground up, but much of the look and feel as well. And on almost every count, Skylines compares very favorably to the former standard-bearer of the city-building genre. It is, in fact, the best of its kind to come along in a full decade – a powerful, flexible, beautiful, and all-around impressive simulation that lets you build sprawling, single-player metropolises to your heart’s content. Building has to be its own reward, though, because the lack of random events or disasters leaves the job of running these towns feeling sleepy and meditative.Playing as part mayor, part god-king with the power to arbitrarily bulldoze your simulated citizens’ dreams and create schools with a click, building a city from scratch is mostly conventional: lay down roads with the easy-to-use tools, designate zones for residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, provide utility services, reap the tax boon, then repeat the cycle with new stuff that’s been unlocked by your growing population hitting new milestones. Skylines finds a mostly happy medium between the complexity of SimCity 4 and the relative simplicity of SimCity 2013 by automatically attaching zoneable areas to roads as they’re laid, but still holding onto obligatory busywork like laying water pipes. Those basics are all tried and true - you couldn’t have a city-builder without them - so it’s mandatory that they be done well. Cities: Skylines does that.The first way this sim knocks it out of the park is in its scale. Each game begins as deceptively small, constricting you to a four-square-kilometer area (the same size as a SimCity map, entirely by coincidence I’m sure), but quickly allows you to buy access to an adjacent plot of land of equivalent size. Then it does this seven more times, for a total possible area of 36 square kilometers. Suffice it to say, there’s plenty of room. And while you can’t directly edit terrain while you play, there’s an included map editor where you can create any land mass you choose before you jump in - or download one from the prominently integrated Steam Workshop mod support.With such large cities, it’s fantastic that Skylines allows you to define and regulate areas individually. Simply paint a chunk of your city with the District tool, and you can not only name it so you can spot it easily on the map, but give it unique policies that regulate everything from mandating smoke detectors to reduce fire hazards (at a cost) to legalizing recreational drug use for lower crime rates, or banning highrise buildings to create defined downtown and suburban areas. In industrial zones, you can specialize the businesses to exploit a map’s natural resources in the area to mine ore, drill for oil, farm on fertile land, or harvest trees for forestry. You can even create tax incentives for a specific type of zone within each district.Let’s zoom in for a moment: we can see individual humans walking through the streets, going to work or school, engaging in leisure activities, or returning home by the thousands. They drive cars, take trains, and even walk dogs. (You can individually name them, but I suggest naming them Waldo, because there are so many that if you find that specific one again you I say you basically win the game.) This is where you realize the time scale becomes absurd. On the slowest speed a day lasts 10 seconds – three and a half on the fastest – which means the journey to work could last a week. But the lack of a day and night cycle means time doesn’t seem too unnatural, but rather an abstraction to serve the speed at which things are built and tax money flows in.Making a major city’s traffic flow smoothly is a puzzle I haven’t come close to fully cracking yet, but I do feel good when I easily create overpasses and freeway onramps to experiment with routes that direct the flow and ease the gridlock... at least partially. By default, most advanced road types are locked out at the start, which makes planning a city around trains or subways nearly impossible (unless you plan on supervillain-level demolition later on), but there’s a sandbox mode that’ll allow you to build whatever you want, whenever you can afford it. (There’s also an unlimited money mode.)Mass transit is a tricky beast. It’s not enough to lay down bus stops and train stations; you have to plot out routes individually, or no one will go anywhere. It’s easy to get lost in that, especially as routes start overlapping and it’s frustrating to get your bus stop placed on the correct side of each narrow road. But there are a lot of options, and the endorphin rush from making a red traffic data overlay turn green makes it all worth it.Up close, buildings are colorful and detailed, right down to small animations like rooftop fans spinning. A slider in the options menu gives us control over the amount of depth-of-field blur applied to distant buildings when zoomed in, which mimics SimCity’s attractive diorama effect. Skylines doesn’t match the graphical quality of SimCity, though, and given the great numbers we see them in they don’t quite have the variety needed to prevent most neighborhoods from looking pretty much the same.What Skylines isn’t good at is telling you what you’ve done wrong, and what problem you need to solve right now. For instance, when I hit 50,000 citizens, the gauge at the bottom of the screen that indicates what new zone type my city wanted in order to expand bottomed out. It didn’t want anything at all. Hundreds of buildings were abandoned, without explanation. How can I address the issues that are hamstringing my city when I don’t know what they are, and the in-game advisors provide no insight? I built new residential, commercial, and industrial zones and waited; eventually, without my taking any deliberate action or receiving any explanation, the zones filled and growth resumed upward of 100,000. I don’t understand why.In that light, it’s fortunate that it’s fairly difficult to send your city into a death spiral without actively trying to, or making worse financial decisions than Greece. It has to be as deliberate as placing a sewage drain pipe directly upstream from your water pump – basically piping raw sewage into your citizens’ tap water – or borrowing more money than you can ever hope to repay. Even crime is disappointingly easy to keep in check with a single police station serving a town of 40,000.It’s limited to man-made crisis-management because there are no earthquakes, tornadoes, destructive floods, nuclear meltdowns, zombie outbreaks, UFO or monster attacks, or anything fun like that. The only thing close to a disaster is a fire, and those don’t spread from one building to another, even if left completely unchecked. I don’t mean to fault Skylines for not cloning every single feature of SimCity, but I do consider disaster management to be a major part of running a big city, and without it Skylines lacks a certain sense of excitement that’s been a staple of the city-building genre since the beginning.More than anything, Cities: Skylines is about the simple joy of building. It’s a really impressive and often beautiful simulation, where an amazing number of virtual people go about their business across a huge swath of land. Getting in and creating something is easy, though mastering it will require extensive research on community wikis to understand why growth is stunted even when you address your citizens’ apparent concerns. Don’t expect exciting scenarios or random events, but do expect to be impressed by the scale and many moving parts of this city-builder.			"

In my opinion this is the best city-building game by now and it totally worth bying. The game is so easy in mastering, that you don't even need any kind of hints or tutorials when you start playing it (even if you didn't play city-builders before). You just pushing ""new game"" and play, interface is so handy it's like you already know where and which tool is placed. Cites: Skylines is extremely absorbing so make sure that you can allow yourself to spend huge amount time on things like videogames. Trust me, you won't even notice how your precious hours will be gone without a trace. However, the game is not perfect, there are pretty much of flaws left by developers (poor traffic AI for example). The good thing that almost all of them can be easily cured with help of mods from Steam Workshop. So if you install mods from following list, the game will be definitely a piece of cake for you :з Recommended mods Automatic BulldozeAutoSave - ConfigurableAll 25 Areas purchasableMod Achievement EnablerPrecision EngineeringTraffic Manager + Improved AIP.S.After Dark is nice, but not really essential. The game is pretty complete already. "

												Excellent city building game. Very addictive, reasonably priced and has mod support. Can't wait to see what kind of stuff people come up with.There isn't much in terms of a tutorials, but the user interface is pretty easy to get to grips with.  It's the sort of game where you learn from your mistakes. I must have started about 5 or so cities before I figured out how to even get the ball rolling, but once you do, it's incredibly compelling.I am on my first city at the moment, and although it is proving profitable, the way I laid out the roads is pretty random and has been causing traffic problems.Also, I started drawing in a totally random bus route, adding stops all over the place and now it is telling me that I haven't completed the loop for my insane bus route and I can't figure out how to complete it for the life of me...or erase it. hahaIt seems pretty bug free, and it is very well optimised. Been playing it on my GT650m laptop and it is running great at 1080p on high settings. It's a very entertaining time sink. You can easily lose hours just evolving and maintaining your city.			"

   Overview    Cities: Skylines is another contender in the city simulation/building management genre. It plants its roots among games such as Sim City and Cities XL to name a select few. What Cities: Skylines does is take those games, turn them upside down and offer a fresh new perspective on a dated genre. To say the game surpasses previous games of this type would be an understatement. The game pulls ahead of the race and never looks back. The developers wanted something new and exciting and Cities: Skylines has it in spades.The overall gameplay is much the same: you start out on a pre-defined landmass with a stack of cash and only your imagination standing in your way. It's your job to name your city, form your plan of attack and make your city thrive (or fail if that's your thing). Much like previous installments in the genre, you'll have your selection of various densities of residential and commercial business, as well as industrial zoning. Cities: Skylines adds to that, offering you the ability to specialize areas for specific purposes with city ordinances - farming and forestry, higher taxes, lower taxes, pollution control, heavy traffic bans, legalization of marijuana...you get the idea. Rather than just zone an area and let it grow, the game offers a deeper look in balancing out wants and needs of your city.Aside from zoning and city ordinances, Cities: Skylines delves into other noteworthy favorites: Emergency services, schools, recreational and public transportation (roads, buses, trains, airports...etc). While most items don't have much involvement aside from adjusting budgets, you are given the ability to create a multitude of transition lines and customize the stops, name them and change the vehicle colors. It helps keep everything neat and orderly.Where the game really shines is within its ability to create mods and custom assets that can be implemented into the game by the community via the Steam Workshop. This takes the vanilla game to a whole new level, introducing new buildings, cars, parks, landscapes to build on, monuments or something entirely brand new. Without the workshop, the game is still pleasant and quite enjoyable, but there is a lot missing in terms of diversity. The workshop gives you that diversity, practically slapping you in the face with it. It takes Cities: Skylines from a great game, to an outstanding game.Now, like all games, there is always room for improvement. While I feel the game is great and I've thoughly enjoyed my time playing it, I feel it falls short in some of the deeper city management aspects. Taxes, for example, don't often need adjusting outside a very fine line unless you want to go bankrupt or have your citizens moving en mass. Once you get your city off the ground, it's very difficult to ""lose"", if you will. You'll be making money hand over fist unless you crank up the difficulty, which then makes budgeting more of a necessity, especially in the beginning of the game, but less so later on as long as you don't do anything drastic that puts you in the red. Since there are no natural disasters as of this review, and fires are localized to just the building on fire (mods do change it so they spread), widespread epidemics aren't a threat, making the need to prepare all but nonexistent.I feel the game is wonderful for what it offers, but feels too easy at times. However, I don't feel any of those negatives negate the enjoyment the game offers.   Pros    Modding Community - The modding community brings out this game's full potential. Building Space - The maps are huge, opening up a lot more options and the ability to have widespread districts and cities.The visuals - The game is colorful and detailed enough to give your city a diverse, pretty landscape.Renaming - You can remain everything - from businesses, homes, vehicles and even livestock.What It's Not - The game is not Sim City 5.   Cons   
Management Systems - The game lacks any in depth management aside from taxes, budgets and ordinances.Difficulty - The game can feel too easy once you get the feel of the mechanics. Increasing the difficulty helps to mitigate some of that, but in the long run it can still feel that way.Natural Disasters - As of this review, there still are none. I hope this changes in the future.Resources - The game can be a little resource heavy and if you're like me and like assets (currently have 400+ new ones), the game can take some time between load screens, even on higher end computers. Overall, Cities: Skylines is a great city builder. It's something I had been waiting for since I played Sim City 4 into the ground back in 2004. If you're into the genre and looking for the right one, Cities: Skylines is, in my opinion, one of the best games out there at this moment. I highly recommend it.			"

												Cities Skylines is not so much of a game as it's a sandbox in which you can build a city.Granted, there is a lot you can build, and the city is very soon very beautiful. The problem is: there's no challenge. Sure, there are the usual problems with traffic, but any of those problems are made by the player, not that the game tosses a wrench into the machinery. You don't even have the usual problems with pollution or disgruntled people, because as long as there is a pretty even mix between industry, residential and commercial zones with a park or two placed, no one will ever be unhappy - I even got a prize for the most beautiful city, and I didn't even aim for that - I just plonked down a couple of parks. The graphics is fantastic, the music fine and the sounds... kind of annoying, especially the sirens that you will hear a lot. There are no bugs that I can think of, so technically speaking, this is an awesome game, but only if you don't want to be challenged, just building a city. And for me, that doesn't cut it.			"

												If you want a city builder that you can chill to, this is it. Complicated mechanics packed neatly in a easy-to-use interface. You can play this at your own pace without stress while bobbing your head with the incredible ost. Spent above 50 hours playing a bootleg version before I bought this on sale but this is definitely worth its full price. You are free to d**k around without long term consequences and the workshop contents are top notch. Pros- *Relaxation simulator*Amazing soundtrack*Gorgeous graphics *Workshop contents are 10/10*Simple mechanics that puts more emphasis on planning than active management*Extreme level of control over your city's economyCons-*You can lose track of time "

TLDR: If you enjoy city builders this is THE GAME to get, it's literally better than the legendary SimCity 4.Cities Skylines offers tons of different choices such as all kinds of road sizes, buildings and services. If you decide to replay the game i recommend downloading some mods as there are tons of great mods for Cities Skylines for even more customization!The only problem i have with Cities Skylines is that it is very easy to gain money and money is really NEVER a concern, a harder difficulty would be a nice addition.As for performance - the game runs a lot smoother than older games from the series, but it's certainly not buttery smooth always, it is a very CPU bound game, an I7 is recommended for the best experience.Final verdict - 9/10			"

												TLDR:The games as a whole feels unfinished, lacks proper tools and objects. Without mods its quite boring, and you fell like you don't have much to see here after 2 hours. Devs are lazy and greedy, releasing DLCs that costs a lot of money but don't change much, and they are basically relying on modders work. Every new DLC makes mods ""out of date"", and no longer usable.This is ridiculous - making life harder for people who actually make your product worth using.Don't get me wrong though - this is a very good game, but unmodified CS is far from perfect.Full story:Pros:+ great graphics;+ quite well optimised;+ unlimited replayability;+ making basic roads is fairly comfortable;+- water physics (acts weird sometimes, but overall works fine).Cons:- without mods allowing prop placement (such as More Beautification) your cities feel lifeless, and spaces between homes / businesses are empty, making them look ugly;- if you want your roads to look realistic, its nearly impossible to build them without such tools as Move it!, Precision Engineering and Road Anarchy;- without mod like IPT, controlling public transport is very basic, and thus not fun at all;- limited graphics configuration options;I keep saying mods, mods, mods... but just think about it - some VERY BASIC things in the game has to be improved by modders, just to operate ""smoothly"". For example, why don't we have an option in game menu to:1. Disable Chirper;2. To disable clouds / fog (especially important for lower end PCs);3. Building demoliton mechanic feels like its designed for tablet / smartphone game. Why do I have to demolish every burned or bankrupt building? They could just implement tickbox ""automatic demoliton"" in base game, if you like to move around your vast city and click like maniac, its your call;4. Placing props while playing, like in ingame object editor;5. Disable ugly pollution texture;I may sound rude, but in my personal opinion, modders make better job at keeping this game fun to play than devs. The game itself seems to be just a frame, designed to be improved by community with no effort of the company that made it.

 Before you read everything: If you want a good looking, easy city building sandbox, don't mind my rating and just go ahead and buy the game.It is definitely not a totally bugged or bad game or total rip-off :)And for some time I had definitely fun with it and still might in the future.Otherwise continue reading:FYI:I played loads of hours Sim City, mostly SimCity 4 + rush hour, which I really liked.Also I did not like the newest Sim City, for its small building zones, not-really-simulation and - most important - for EA, a company I learned to hate => In case of SC, for their false online only claims because of ""CPU heavy simulation only achievable in the cloud and not possible for home PCs"" blah blah. Yeah, you saw that very intensive simulation in spreading work force and trash trucks, haha. (besides it was obviously possible to play off line from the beginning) UPDATE [24/05/15] Some minor stuff has been fixed. And although I did not play with the newest patch released some days ago yet, most issues which annoy me are - according to patch notes - still there.When rating the game, I do so without mods. And without, the game gets pretty fast boring (for me) if you want more than just a ""build the prettiest city sandbox"". In my opinion mods are great for enhancing replayability or making smyller adjustments - but they should not become a necessity.And even though I had to think a long time about it, I still find my negative rating fitting. This game is sort of a hate-love-relationship. When I started playing it I really love the game:- graphics is not overwhelming but looking good, giving a nice city building flair- sound is soothing and does not get onto one's nerves- relatively good balanced progress- not feeling too fast or slow and I only seldom sped up the time- building/maintenance costs are fine- tax management simple but still ok- love how water/energy systems works (not too simple, not too much micro-management)- street system is doing good- district system nice, especially with the different resources for industry- actual water physics simulation! Building a hydro dam(n) needs real planning (and some testing, save your game ;) )Then I found some flaws; the in-game message chirper is kind of annoying (and badly placed btw), it's ridiculous to not being able to scroll with holding right mouse button, some view management is sorta weird and transportation volumes are not realistic.This is where the mods come in: for all those and more minor issues I found good working fixes in the workshop and from what I saw, some of the issues were fixed in the past, so in time you might even be able to go without them.But - here it comes - in the long run, the game does not fit my needs.In general it's too easy. After some harder times (in terms of cash problems) in the beginning, it gets pretty easy as soon as you get to use the high density zones. In my second city,  with a tax rate of 12% for everything after setting it to 14 for a short time, then going down to 12   I had a plus of 10k+/week. Even though I kept building here and there and making everything looking nice, I was not able to spend my money faster as I got it.Up until then it is real fun. But from this point, it is making the game a bit too sandbox-like with the focus on ""how to make it look nice"" and without the hassle for careful planning how and where to expand the city.Besides this, there are some really down-bringing issues in the game, that get more un-nerving in the long run.These are mostly unrealistic behavior or balance issues:- Electricity production is a joke. From the beginning, wind-energy is in term of $/W not only cheaper than any coal or gas plant, but also non-polluting. As soon as you get the solar power plant, you don't have to worry about energy at all, as it is even cheaper. Also neither wind nor sun energy has differing output, like dynamic wind speed or clouds. So there is no reason at all to not build wind/solar plants- The resource system does not have a real depth: Yes, you can set specific districts for agriculture, ore, oil or forest industry. But besides more/less tas and pollution (and different buildings, obviously), there is no really meaning in that. Yes, you can use the oil for your oil energy plant, but why? Wind is still cheaper. And there is no big difference in export or anything, too.- While the water pollution system is nice, the land pollution is very very friendly. Have a coal power plant? Well, pollution only spreads about one-two blocks - after that you can build residences again.- AI for garbage and death care needs improvements. Death care: In larger cities (30k+), there are continually areas where dead people wait for transport to the crematory or grave yard - even if you have enough of them and they are not using all of their vehicles yet. Garbage: Trucks are working (yes, SC in your face :D ) but the system to send the garbage from a full dump to a incineration plant is not good. Even the old SC4 was working better in that case.- UI/views. I still cannot click a street and see who is going where, like SC4 rush hour -> this might improve the generally nice transportation system a lot! Overall:- The game lacks in terms of content: some areas (medicine) are great - others (power, industry resources, politics, tourism, ..) have too few buildings/possibilities.- Simulation is not realistic enough/goes not deep enough. Too easy power simulation, too easy fire/crime/medicine/education system, no real impact of industry/resource choices, etc.As said before:If you want to just build a nice city, go ahead. I had a great time so far with the game. Had to install a few mods for that, but with them it is fun for some time.If you expect a nice city builder simulation, maybe it's better to wait for a DLC/the next part. Seeing that the game seems to be quite successful in terms of sold copies, I guess there is a good chance for one or the other :)			"

												I feel very rude and it frustrates me to write this, but I do not recommend Cities: Skylines unless it is at a good sale price. I love simulation games, but this one grew stale and was not for me.The first several hours were really enjoyable and I even went as far as to get the After Dark DLC at a sale price since I anticipated I'd be addicted. But only a few hours later did I realize I wasn't enjoying the game anymore. There are no ""scenarios"" to play, adding actual goals to the game, unless you get the Natural Disasters DLC (and there are apparently very few). You're just left to endlessly build a city with intricate micromanagement. If that sounds like your type of game, buy it! If that's all you want, this game will be perfect.My major complaints that led to me stop enjoying the game began with the lack of customization. For the first while, before your city's population adds up and you unlock more features, there's not much to add personalization to your city to make it feel like your own. Different types of roads and other customizations are blocked off arbitrarily in the early portion of building a city, and you'll only get access to these by boosting your population by a stated amount. It makes sense! It really does, but it made the first hour or two of starting a new city absolutely boring. I feel the game would have benefitted from loosening these restrictions.... and to follow that up, you may say ""there are mods, though!"" Yes, there are, and I was very excited to try them. However, the community proves that there are troubles with every update. Mods become incompatible, unsupported by the developers, and as a new player, lots of research will go into finding out how to use these mods and have them appear in your game, like custom buildings or styles. Many times, just trying to make sure custom content appeared in the in-game ""Content Manager"" would crash the game just after a few items. I thought it was just because I originally ran the game on an external hard drive, but I eventually tried it on my internal SSD, and the mods just seemed to hamper the game.If you have a lot of patience to learn the sciene behind the custom content of the game, and don't mind the aimless city-building with not much else to look forward to but ""more, more and more"". This is a sandbox game for you, no question. I understand why some people like it, but after the amount of time I played, I just feel exhausted and need a long break. The pleasure of growing my city sort of numbed itself.			"

												I like this game, but I don't LOVE this game.  Why?  The traffic A.I. is miserable.  Emergency Vehicles follow the flow of traffic.  They do not run red lights.  And all traffic in general takes the closest, not fastest route.  The Dev's have said it would take too much work.  Really?I will not be buying the DLC for this until traffic is fixed.  I probably won't play until then either.  This could be never though.  The dev's would rather sell DLC than fix bugs or try for a better base game experience.I really wanted to love this game...

												Overall, the game is pretty solid. The simulation, the tools and the gameplay is all just so fluid. Everything runs extremely well and cities feel legitimate and alive.The game does have some flaws here and there, yet it's still a very simple and straight to the point city builder with no bull ♥♥♥♥ attached. (DLC, DRM) It does takes quite a bit aspects from SimCity 2013 though (honestly a scary amount) but thankfully leaves all of the bad ones out. With regards to how it compares to SimCity 4 though, I'd say SC4 is still superior but just barely. Cities: Skylines offers a more simpler and easier yet less balanced economic system than SC4 did, which isn't necessarily a good thing. SC4 also had better information screens, the ability to modify landscape in-game, and doesn't have this questionable building unlocking progression. Also, I need to mention the lack of 'God' controls and commands such as disasters that SimCity 4 did have.But thankfully, the game has just been released and the dev team will continue to make updates for months maybe years to come and the modding community for this game is already phenomenal.Graphics: 8.5/10Audio: 8.5/10Gameplay/Replay-ability: 9.25/10Interface: 8.75Traffic/Simulation: 9.25/10Mod Support: 9.5/10Overall, I give this game a 9/10.

												If you in need of a real city builder - this games has it all! It looks nice, can handle lower end PCs and is capable of scaling right up to your UBER rig ;) The gameplay is rock solid, diverse, highly mod friendly (The workshop is fully of ♥♥♥ kicking custom assets and welcome additions like the resolution upscaler) and still manages not to overwhelm newcomers. Forget games with XXL in their title cuz Cities: Skyline really delivers! Period. No, srysly ... there is no other city builder besides Skylines. This is the SimCity we all wanted a couple years ago, for just a fraction of its price. And by the way, their small DLC offers are completely fair - add meaningful content and are completely optional. Like the trams they added in Snowfall - its cool, nice to have - but totally not required for even the largest city. So far I had a ton of fun  ;)			"

												The beauty of Cities: Skylines is its accessibility.  (Video Review Below)From playing to modding. Everything can be played with, tweaked, altered or changed. Noobies or veterans alike will find something to enjoy in this City building, strategy game. While the tutorial does an okay job of explaining things. It does have a little bit of a learning curve. With a focus on proper placement. Once you get the basics of the game down though, the world opens up to you. Every aspect to city management is there for you to tinker with. Transportation, sanitation, taxes, policies, districts and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Developer Colossal Order and Publisher Paradox Interactive lets there experience shine in this extremely well done game. With insane amounts of mod support, steamy goodness and virtually no bugs. This is the city building game people have been waiting for.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												Did you play SimCity and you were disappointed by how fast the gameplay seemed to stall out? Did you not play city sims before, and you are looking for a good place to start? Either way this game is a brilliant choice for you. The content offering it provides is abselutely insane. Compared to the already mentioned SimCity, I would say you get 5x the game for 1/3 the price. After 450 hours of gameplay, I have never ""finished"" any city to the point where I could not expand any further. To top it all off, basically any annoying gameplay issue you encounter can be solved in 5 minutes of browsing the workshop. I will now get picky and point out the biggest weaknesses I have found during my hundreds of hours of playtime, but keep in mind that I would never play the game that much if I did not love it in it's current state.  The DLC is not worth it. The DLC almost costs half of the game itself, and adds very little to the gameplay. After Dark mostly makes it very annoying to build half of the time, because it is, you know... dark at night. Apart from that the gameplay around the day/night cycle is not that appealing, to me at least. Snowfall would be worth if there was a season cycle, but you either have permanent snow, or no snow at all. Some mods are almost mandatory. I don't consider this a big issue, but I know nothing about the performance implications of mods on low end machines. The game is totally playable without mods, I actually had every steam achievement available before DLC, so I have enjoyed quite some hours with no mods. It is just that when you first start modding, it's really hard to go back(this is why I don't have any of the DLC achievements, lol). Some costs seem very unbalanced. In the ""standard game"" I often found myself splitting my budget 50/50. Between garbage plus death services, and everything else... Why is as expensive to burn your garbage as it is to upkeep all your hospitals, fire stations, and police stations combined? These things are really easy to mod on your own though, so again, it's not a game breaking issue. If you think you might enjoy the game a quarter as much as I do, it's probably your best buy you ever made.			"

This is by far the best Simulator regarding relativityAs soon as you launch the Cities.exe your GPU starts to render supermassive frames that influence time and space on a gravitational level. The effect you will experience is called Time Dilation. Some are reporting that they lost more than 10 hours at once, after using the Simulation for just a very short time. Leading scientists are trying to calculate the exact amount of time you are going to loose by executing this Simulation - The public is still waiting for the results.Stay Tuned			"

												Everthing about this city builder functions perfectly as you'd expect and more. For instance, one thing speaks to how much thought has and may continue to be put into this game: the ability to close off a body of water with a dam, build pumps in it, and drain it. A short while after draining the body of water, grass soon grows on what was once dirt and you can plop down more city. You can even put sewage pumps along that area beforehand, remove the water pumps before turning them on, and flood your new stretch of city with poop water. If you really hate your citizens, you can place new water pumps in the ruins of your new-ish poop-flooded part of the city and your citizens all throughout your city will become poisoined and die.Sure most of that has little to do with the whole city building thing most of the time but it tells me everything I need to know about their dedication to detail and sandbox mechanics.

												This game is awesome. This game is like the latest Simcity, except Paradox thoroughly looked through it and turned bad things into good things. Such as; your city isn't limited as it is in Simcity. In Cities: Skylines your town can be f*cking enormous. Another thing about this game that Paradox did better than Maxis and EA is that you don't need 11,000 watertowers. You can just increase the budget on the water and sewage department. If it still isn't enough, you should maybe buy one or two more waterpumps. Still, this game is awesome. Definitely Game of the Year for me. This is basically everything Simcity  isn't .			"

												I've been waiting to play this game ever since it was announced last year, and because I decided to skip EA's latest SImCity game, I've had tons of hype for this game. Needless to say, this game has very much exceeded my expectations, and I've haven't had so much fun since playing SimCity 4 (with Cheat Engine because I suck at it and I'm impatient) and SimCity 3000.Basically, this game is what SimCity (2013) should have been: larger maps, mod support, single player mode at launch, and most of all, not having the need to play with an always-on internet connection.Would I recommend that you buy this game? Well, it would probably be likely that I'll be playing just this game for the next few months or so, so it's a big fat yes.			"

After a while it just becomes a mindless clicker where you click click click away the fire stations and high schools and get the little happy faces as feedback. Basically whole game boils down to how beautiful of a city you can make with minimal amount of actually managing it.			"

												I thought I really liked this game when it was released. I poured countless hours into it and created huge sprawling cities, one after the other. But when I started to dig deeper into the gameplay and strategic elements of this game such as managing the cities economy and taxes, I've come to find that the game falls flat in many aspects. The overall look and feel of the cities you create come to feel quite lifeless with nothing much in the design giving much excitement. Landmarks are very limited unless you go through the modding community, end game structures are completely broken, such as practically leveling up every building to maximum across the whole city with one building, plus unrealistic in their function. The maps themselves are very uninteresting, and flat. I would have hoped that the expanstions would have brought more to the game but the night expansion was a complete waste of money and gave me maybe a couple hours of interest. And an expansion to add permanent snow? No thanks. I also can't understand the idea that poorer people are happy to pay more taxes and wealthy people are capped at paying someting like 11-12% and even if you improve their area, it's not ever possible to raise the taxes without them abandoning. The district system seems interesting at first but despite it looking to deep, I've never really found any interesting ways of implementing them other than 'oh industrial area so I guess I'll add the fire alarms ordinance here' etc... its all very obvious and repetitive. I really want to like this game, and I like Paradox games in general, but I just can't agree with the amound of praise this game is getting. Even the zoning design is terrible as patches of grass appear everywhere making the city look incomplete. Having lived in a city my whole life I know what a city should look like and Paradox are not quite hitting the mark I'm afraid. Also the farms are terrible too, since when are farms zoned in small blocks? They just don't look realistic at all. The one thing this game does well and that is the traffic system. Controlling the flow of traffic on this game is quite beautifully done and that is what the game is, it's basically one big traffic sandbox. I do hope to find a new found interest in this game some day, but unfortunately I think that its lifespan may well have turned out to be even worst than SimCity :s			"

												The best darn city builder, dare I say... ever? Yes indeed! I pre-ordered this game and it had to be one of the best if not the best pre-order I have ever made. From 11amCST to 2am on release day I played this game like crazy! And the best part I am not even close to finishing with my first city, there is so much content and things to do its crazy that is even a city builder! You like building, you will love this game, shoot if you love managing or sim games you will love this one. This game does everything other games of the genere haven't, a million times better than Sim City of 2013. The traffic  simulation is top notch, there are so many choices for roads, like the ability to build your own highways! There is a load of unique buildings, many transportation options, and so much more. Anything you want in a city builder this game has it! However, it is also a challenge, you wont have incredible city very quickly. A lot of issues can hit you hard while your population expands, my only complaint is that you need many, many, many, service buildings to cover a very large city, To much in my mind, I hope they tweak that because it can really drain your income. Again, though this game is fun, creative, innovative, challenging, and above all a great city builder. You will not regret picking this one up, atm it is the 2015 Game of the Year!			"

Recommended: While there's a few rough edges in the design, I can safely say Cities: Skylines is probably my favourite modern city-builder since SimCity 4, and that's been a long while indeed.  It looks great, runs well, and does a great job in offering a variety of transit and building options.  The lacking aspects beyond some more services (such as libraries or museums from SC2K for example), are mostly in the fine details, as creating transit lines can get quite finicky, and having to manually demolish abandoned building becomes a chore with a large city.  Nonetheless a new paragon in it's genre; Skylines is the new benchmark, the one to beat when it comes to city-building.Read the full review on Highland Arrow here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												Cities: Skylines is a worthy contender in the scarce city building sim arena. With it's moddability/extendability (almost everything can be modded: from assets, how cims behave, to creating new tools that modify how roads are built) and the support that the devs are giving, I'm pretty sure there is currently no other city building simulator that comes near to it.

												Another city building game, but it's not quite like the others.  More on that later, first my list of pros and cons;PROS:- Water has current, which you have to plan for so as not to polute your own shores.- Water can controlled, both current and levels using hydro dams.- Citizens have specifically assigned residences (and jobs), making traffic more realistic.- The various interface overlays makes determining the placing of utility structures very easy.- You can practically do anything you want to when it comes to roads/highways/ramps.- Graphics are superb and performance is amazing, regardless of zoom level.- You get the feeling of SimCity, without the bad taste it left behind.- Completely customizable routes for buses, subways, and trains.- High number of road types for you to select, everything from gravel to highways.CONS:- Constant ""tweets"" got pretty annoying after a while.- Tweets about problems that shouldn't exist (ex. dead person, with a crematorium next door).- Building with full fire coverage would burn down and prompt you to check fire coverage.- Not enough options to deal with garbage and collection ranges seemed unrealistic.- A lot of specialty buildings had ""noise"" zones that seemed unreasonably large.- No real options to deal with industry polution, other than to keep it away from everything else.- Not enough random building names, I'd often find 6-8 buildings in a row with the same name.- Small number of maps included (although more are available).- No way (that I've found) to have a subway come to the surface.- No streetcars- Ships (cruise/cargo) movement seemed extremely unrealistic, as if it was an afterthought.- Music is EXTREMELY repetative, I had to turn it off after a while.- Road ""snapping"" can be annoying when working on highway offramps, even when it's supposedly turned off.Now that I've given you that basic list, let's get down to brass tax.  Everyone is correct when they say that this game is everything that SimCity should have been.  That said, it is lacking in a few basics that SimCity actually had.  The biggest thing in my list of pet peves for this game would have to be garbage collection.  In my 80,000 population city (real life) there is one garbage dump and the entire city's garbage has been going there since the city was built.  In this game, by the time my population was 10,000 I had 4 garbage dumps spread out across the landscape.  By the time I hit 80,000 there was an entire district devoted to garbage dumps (10 of them) with 6 insinerators trying (unsuccessfully) to keep them from being full.  I even had the recycling policy in place, and still my garbage dumps were overflowing.  Oh, that's another thing, no recycling centers?Anyway, when you put this game beside SimCity there really isn't any question that Cities: Skylines is the superior game overall.  It does have it's issues, but it's by far the best all around city building game that's been produced.  Don't go into this game expecting your every city building dream to come true, just enjoy it for what it is.EDIT:Since the addition of the Workshop to Cities:Skylines most of the problems I mentioned are easily solved by downloading 3rd party workshop items, like a recycling center.  This game is now my #1 city building game.			"

												9.5/10-------The last city building game I have played is the SimCity 4: Rush Hours, which I like terribly. However, finally made a decision to get something new for the nicer graphics, somehow different gameplay, modding opportunities and fun. I don't have to say that Cities: Skylines have it all, and moreover it is a pleasure to play this game. There are some graphics and mechanics glitches, but I believe they'll be all fixed (e.g. despite the fact that I dezoned some land, the factories kept building there...). Even the modding tool is so easy to use and accessible that I actually started playing by creating my own park :) This game is highly recommended for all the city builders fans, and will definitely get even better!!!----What I miss in the game:- day/night cycle- seasons- if not seasons, at least winter theme! :)			"

												Cities: Skylines, is perhaps the ultimate city building game, a must have for Steam, and should absolutely be the first city builder someone plays. First off, let me dispell some worries you may have, I know I had some. This game has MASSIVE maps, you unlock them piece by piece as your city grows, HOWEVER, you will only be able to have a total of 9 tiles, so plan out your city according to that. (9 Tiles is still huge, dont get the wrong idea)Skylines is also a VERY easy game to get into. My chief concern about this game was that it would be more learning HOW TO play, instead of actually playing, and wheres the fun in that? Fortunately, Skylines is easy to understand and master. *The biggest reason why you should buy Skylines is mod support. These range from buildings, cars, and all sorts of things. What makes this feature even better is that some buildings created in workshop have requirements that need to be met before they can be constructed (These requirements are chosen by the person who made it in workshop), which can potentially add more to the game. TL;DR: If youre looking for the pinnacle of city builder games, and/or a city builder thats easy and simple to understand, you should buy it.			"

												I would love nothing more than to give Cities: Skylines a glowing review as I've played it for several hours beyond what steam shows, but frankly, I'm disappointed in their recent DLC practices. It's eerily similar to Payday 2, where they had a great game and then milked it to no end for every last penny. Snowfall? Natural Disasters? After Dark? These should either be a part of the vanilla game or a singular expansion, not individual ~$15 DLC items. As for the Stadium and Content Creator DLCs, those are just ridiculous, it's like the Sims with endless ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC that's expensive and shouldn't be standalone. Really disappointed in them going down this route.			"

												Games are only as good as the companies who make them. And this one is no exception. Cities: Skylines is the KING of city building games. Awesome graphics and gameplay, HUGE plot of land to grow your city on and best of all: a modding community that reigns supreme. Simcity 2013 was the equivalent of Michael Bay's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Meaning we waited years and years for a new release and all we got was an atrocious reboot. Colossal Order has answered our prayers and given us this masterpiece. Not to mention that unlike Simcity 2013, theres no requirement to sign in to a server to play.2 thumbs WAY way up for Colossal Order.			"

												This is the true city-simulator successor for this generation. The modding capabilities, districting, road laying mechanics and the large city sizes are some of the big plusses in my book. The down sides include the building and park placement mechanics and also the lack of ability to make farms with huge fields. Cities: Skylines is a new standard for future games of this genre despite some of its bugs and I hope to see what the developers and modders alike can do to make this game experience the best with today's gaming technologies.Totally worth paying full price.

												Pros- Solid, simple yet creative and freeroam city building game.- Beautiful environment.- New features such as Zone Unlocking, District and Asset Editor add more depth to the game.- Better than that ""another City-building game"" in the major ways. Cons- Most buildings are pretty identical.- Road and zone planning can be frustuated.- Just a single city, no regional areas. Nor multiplayers (probably a good thing).Final VerdictFinally, the next-gen, 3D, fully-moddable, functional city simulation game! If you like city-building games, this game is for you. Although the game is relatively small but the revival community will sure keep it going. Great work, Colossal Order.9/10!			"

												Absoultely wonderful game!  I have played over 850 hours.  This is what SimCity 5 should have been.  This game was obviously made by people who love city building and played previous city simulatons.  Everything works right.  Slow initial city loading time but from there all is smooth.   Many ways to play.  Lay out a design for a big city or small town are the fine as they are, or soon grown and eventually join.   Lots to learn to be more efficient.  Can be played casual or challenging. As with real cities traffic congestion and polution soon become a growing problem.  Lots of in game items that are solutions...  But it is very satifying to figure out your own unique designs and solutions.   A big active community of support is another good feature of this game.   I had all my friends by this game they all liked it or loved it as I do.   I highly recommend it.			"

A handful set of buildings, that does not forget about any aspect of city building, yet is not overwhelming with the number of ploppables?5. Citizen-and-his-house-and-his-wife-and-his-car-and-his-garbageman-and-that-plane-above-them following?6. Big-♥♥♥ cities?7. Water simulation, from water current to actual waves?8. A lot of resources to care about?9. And a lot of mods from Workshop and future updates from developers?10.

												I burnt out on Sim City 2000 back then, when it came out.I've had no intention to ever play a citybuilder game.Several came out over the years, newer Sim City versions and others (just search ""city"" here on steam).I tried those, too, but always convinced myself pretty quick that I couldn't stand the gameplay.And then, I've seen this gem. It's nothing new. It's full of references to the older titles.But it's implemented so clean and polished in every detail it's a blast to play!I'm having a very good time trying new things and the fun of the Sim City 2000 memories is back!

												It was a blast from the past which sets the new standard on the city building genre. I believe that it was called Cities: Skylines for a reason. The usage of plural noun, in this case 'cities' instead of 'city' really lives up its name. Literally, the available space is big enough to make multiple cities. Thus, put the title alone, this game beats its 'singularity'-ish predecessors.Enuff Said, 11/10!			"

												This is a fantastic city building game, but if you are looking for the ability to drive around your city as shown in Sim City 3 and up, not quite it. I'm also going to give you a warning that this game may eat away at your hours. Reading over the reviews, I've seen this game a multitude of times compared to Sim City. The biggest comparison I see is that, this game has been labelled ""easier"". In some sense it's true, but when you realize how big your city can be and the unique styles you can give to your roads, it can get complicated. The game is about building up a city, but eventually turns into managing one instead of it managing itself. The gameplay is relatively simple. Everything is laid out for you, and as your city grows, so does your ability to build upgraded or newer buildings. Taxes can be adjusted, budgets can be adjusted (for parks, buses, water works, electricity etc...), and loans can be taken out. Even if you are not extremely familiar how economics work in a municipality, the game does it's best to advise you of everything going on. Placing police stations, fire stations, hospitals, or even schools becomes very easy as the game does an extremely good job in showing which areas are covered. What can drive a few people nuts is putting water pumps near sewage dumps. At first, you may smile as you see water is being delivered to your residents and that the sewage water is far away (especially in the first level with the lake). You'll then notice a lot of water being polluted and eventually making it's way up to your water pumps. It is imperative that my readers know to build down stream or to use water towers where sewage may be an issue! They also make it easy to see what crime rates are (check the top left of your screen), what your citizens happiness is, pollution, electricity and water availability, natural resources and a few others. The biggest feature in the game to me it seems, is the ability to really architect the roads. In Sim City, you are able to put zones wherever you please. In Skylines, you have only the choice to build near roads. Zoning is made easy and can be done with a fill brush tool or individual squares can be assigned. A huge feature in Skylines is districts. Districts are designed by you and are designated by you as well. Want a forest industry? Want a mining industry? Want a farming industry by residential areas? This can be done through districts. Definitely a notable feature in the game. Bus stops and other sort of transport is available. They try to give you as much control as possible within the game. Bus stops are designated by you and are placed where you'd like them to be. At first it is difficult to control where the bus goes when placing the stops, but choosing the RIGHT side of the road is important for it to work properly! Visuals and sounds are appropriate. The music is neither condemning or over the top, but the repitid Sounds follow your screen, and you will hear buildings burn if they are on fire. At first glance, I thought traffic was extremely horrible in my city. I zoomed in closer and saw they actually park their cars in front of their house. Good to see the attention to detail put in. I bought this game on sale and am quite content with the product. I would like to have a feature where I can drive through my city or even go on a rampage with a truck. Maybe it's asking too much from a city builder, but having complete control like this is what differentiates the best from the rest.RATING : 7.5/10Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B- Overall  BScreenShots :  SCREENSHOT 1  SCREENSHOT 2  Pretty much completed Not the ideal screenshot of showing off a bridge  I thought the bus stops in my city were crowded Even emergency vehicles do not pass a funeral procession "

												Ever since simcity-4, city simulation has become more off a hobby for me than just occasional game play. Over the years I have created many custom buildings (mainly Paris and medieval themes) and mods (amongst other the Jupiter (weather) and the Aurora mods) for simcity-4. Simcity 2013 was a major disappointment on all accounts.I have been fortunate to have been invited to test Cities Skylines' modding tools during the beta phase for the past couple of months. And during that time I have also been able to play the game. Cities Skylines exceeds my expectations. The potential that can be unlocked by the community and by DLCs provided by CO is unbelievable. I am absolutely overwhelmed by how great this game is. Additionally, I have gained the utmost respect for CO. It is unbelievable what a small team of creative people can do. Aside from developing a fantastic game, CO actually listens to the community to the best of their abilities. Bound by an NDA, it has been challenging for me not being able to respond to all the comments, questions, critisicm, (sometimes unjust) speculation on the forums. And I kept thinking if only you could get to play the game for half an hour and - like me - become captivated by studying the little CIMS in their daily routine, or laying out the most amazing road interchanges. Finally a game I can enjoy again without having to shoot someone. Off course some I do share some of the criticism that also has been shared on the forums. I could even create a list of a dozen or more features that I would like to see changed or improved. But all that is driven by my enthusiasm for this game, and there is a time a place for everything. So for now I am just giving this game a 10/10.			"

												City building, one of the great monuments of mankind. Isn't the blatent repurposing of the earth's bounty for our mundane consumption and shelter the epitomy what it means to be human? Yes it is. And when you play Cities: Skylines you will come to appreciate the craftsmanship and skill involved in such an undertaking. It took me seven resets before I finally got a city running properly; and even then did I throw all my progress and work out the window just because it wasn't perfect enough. City building is strategy game in the truest form. It requires long term planning and foresight. Overlooking any aspect at the start can come back to haunt you later on. Like in my first city, everything was running smoothly until everyone fell ill from polluted drinking water. The tides from the coast weren't very good at disposing the sewage. So instead of fixing it, I decided to throw all that away and found a new city alongside a flowing river instead. With the water problem covered for now a new plague rose up. Power. I had to learn a few tricks from a pretty good youtuber to get the basics down; he showed you could start a city with a single wind tubine and save much more money for facilities. However, turbines are fickle and the wind is their enabler. As a result, it became a structural struggle to provide power for my budding metropolis. Once again, I threw the stuff away and started a new city, besides a river, on a hillside. At this point it should be clear that this game has a significant learning curve. You really need to invest and try stuff to get the hang of it. However, it does turn out to be rewarding, as your city vivibly evolves under your direction. It is welcoming to see a game so strong in visual feedback. A bustling city is more amusing to behold than a dying one, so it is an extra motivator to keep exploring and trying for new stuff. Now I'm in my 5th game and power and water are no longer a problem. The real challenge presents itself when you're expanding. Expanding is hard. You basically have to create a new city from scratch, and you effectively double your resource consumption in the process. Once again, your early choices make all the differences. Depending on how you positioned your first district in regards to the highway can make all the difference for the new stream of inhabitants and commuters. You'll have to consider traffic flows from a very early point to make them work in the long run. And that is how I began my 6th city. So after much trial and error, I am now running my 8th city and it is running like clockwork. I even have a booming oil and ore industry, as well as a modern office district and many options for easy living. At this point it helps to explore the extremely well crafted advisor windows. These intergrated menu screens can give you a direct glimpse into the affairs of your metropole. Fire safety, crimerate, congestion, pollution; it's all expertly depicted with easy to understand colour graphs and real time feedback from the system about current problems. The interface is such a marvel, I think more games could benefit from it. As your city grows, your scope zooms out and you move away from street corner politics and small scale renovations. Your footprint grows and so does your city. City: Skylines is possibly the best city building game ever made. Thanks to its direct feedback from the real time game, excellent interface and amazing graphics, it is a game worth building a city in, and then to wish you could one day live in it.Granted that you don't mess up at the start because no one wants to live in highway congestion. Punishing at the start. It certainly rewards the intrepid frontier's men/women.			"

												I will start off with saying that I can't recommend this game. Which is a shame.It just isn't a finished product in my opinion. You will get something that resembles a release ready product if you choose to use the Workshop and download assets and mods. This will however prove to be an unwise decision as when a new DLC+patch comes, you can most likely say goodbye to your city. You will at least have a very hard time getting it to run like it did the day before said content was released. Many are praising the game for its water dynamics, I won't. Actually I think the water is really bad. Build a dam? The water will have none of that and start flowing upstreams just to get away from it. I would had been excited over the water if you could add streams when creating maps in the editor. Like drawing a stream with a special tool to tell the water which direction to go and intensity.Let's talk about powerplants.There are seven of them to choose from, two of which are windpower and two which you most likely will never use. Those two would be the dam and the solar power plant. The dam is useless because of how water functions in the game, no it is not me that is incompetent. I have done a lot of testing in the editor to try and get it right for a dam, and honestly it is such a pain to get it to work that you are better off just plopping down windpower or any of the rest. Even the solarplant would be better. Nice clean energy to power your city, right? No. Nighttime was added to the game, and for some reason in the universe this game plays out in, they have not invented any method to store generated extra power. So when the darkness falls, there will be no tv watching or showering for your cims, as the plant produces 0 energy for the duration of the night.Did you read somewhere that they where introducing weather in the newest DLC+patch? Did you also hear them saying that the weather was cosmetic? Well...it isn't. Apparently the ""cosmetic"" fog will block out the sun and lower the effeciency of your solar plant. ""Cosmetic"" rain will make the temperatures drop so your cims use more power to heat their homes. Doesn't really sound that cosmetic, does it?All that is fine, this is what happens in real life with weather, but the cluelessness of the publisher stating obvious wrong facts in interviews is not. So with the nighttime and fog, you might just want to skip that solar power plant.The AI in the game is horrible. I am sure you have heard about it on forums and such. The cars will force themselves into one or two lanes instead of using the full potential of the roads. Emergency vehicles will patiently keep behind the other drivers and so on.Another thing that is quite annoying is the complete lack of developer presence on the game's forums here on Steam. In my opinion, if you choose to release a game on Steam you should also be bothered with the big community it will gather there. I think that the sole reason for Cities: Skylines ""success"" is that people where desperate after something else after being let down by Simcity: 2013.If you decide to buy this game you will get some fun out of it at the beginning, but you will with no doubt get more and more annoyed later on when finding more and more stuff in the game that simply does not work, or works in a very odd way.Defender of the devs need not comment about this and that, if this is the best game in the world for you and everything works like a charm then go and make a positive review and enjoy your game.

												This is one of the best city building games i have ever seen cause it gives you plenty of vanilla material and sometimes gets you thinking outside the box and get creative. It has workshop support so if you run out of fun in the vanilla game there is the addons on the workshop whit sections like: Mods, Buildings, Transport, Fire, Health and police Department and many more. Also Paradox and Collosal Orders [The Creators Of This Game] make DLCs and Huge! updates to the game every now and then. After Dark DLCThis DLC includes the Day and Night cycle, Better airport, Taxies and Tourisim! Now thats a bunch we also have the Snow Fall DLCSnow Fall DLCIt includes Trams, Heating, Snow Plows And obviosly Snowy Maps. Thats so far with the DLCs. I dont really want to talk about the updates because it would take too long so I leave it up to you to find out whats new and whats gona come out next. "

												This game if of high quality. Smooth, pretty, intuitive. BUT: There is one downside with this game, and it's big enough that I would not recomend it:The game is so easy it becomes meaningless and boring. There is absolutely no chance you wil go bankrupt, and making everyone in your city happy is trivial. Then what's the point?EDIT: I realize that the game might be a challenge to people that either have no experience with city simulators, or know absolutely nothing about traffic engineering or city planning. If you do, however, the game becomes trivial, and more about making the ""perfect"" city than about making a functioning city.			"

 Nice City Builder with ♥♥♥♥ing traffic jam problem after reach 80K population above  It has a good graphic for city builder game  Steam Community Workshop isn't bad either, many interesting items there first time I play this game I think ""wow it's little bit hard to solve traffic jam problem, and why my city population won't increase after 32K???"" but now maybe Cities: Skyline helps me a lot to know what other people think if I do a mistake, because the NPC wont stop complaining before I solve the problem.  If you love city builder game, I recommend this game If you never play city builder, Try this game. Not too hard for starter but after reach 2400 population, you will need strategy If you like a game that requires patience, I recommend this gameI bought this game one week before the discount, and I was a little annoyed with that Overall Ratings:  11/10   "

If you Build It, They Will ComeHop in the Review-Well Delorean because we're going back in time, way back to the glory days of  1989.Not because this is the year that Back to the Future II was released,  not because I want to warn my younger self that Indiana Jones isn't really going on his last crusade and not because Kevin Costner is about to discover his ""Field of Dreams""We're going back to 1989 because this is the year that the City Building game was born.Platform WarsWhilst Amiga and Atari ST owners argued over who's computer was better<cough> Amiga <cough>both sides could agreed that the PC with its blocky graphics and awful sound would never be a true gaming platform.Paradise CityThere was also agreement about another equally important gaming matter, that this new game ""SimCity"", no matter which format you played it on, rocked!You could build your own city, your own roads, railroads, infrastructure. It was mind-blowing.In fact it was a concept that rocked so hard that the Los Angeles based Guns N Roses (the ""One Direction"" of the late 80's*)released a song to celebrate its greatness called Paradise City.*(*These facts may be erroneous and are awaiting citation.)Up All NightSo now we've witnessed the city building ""big bang"" we need to get out of here before the Libyans find us.It's time to go back, not to the future, well to the future of the past, but not the future of the present!  (I love time travel!)It's 2011, One Direction have just released their first album (One Direction rose to popularity to fill the gap in the time line left by Guns N Roses who may or may not have gone missing during the alien attack on Los Angeles in 2010 as depicted in the documentary ""Battle Los Angeles"" **)(** Almost certainly true but citation is pending.)Bus Replacement ServiceAnother important event of this time period was the release of ""Cities in Motion"".An excellent little  transport simulation game by Colossal Order which had you placing bus stops and metro stations across little city maps then sitting back and watching the ensuing commuter nightmare as your ineffective planning came to light.My own gaming limitations aside, this was a gem of a game and left me wishing that I could manage the city development around the transportation network I was building.The Ice Queen Cometh...It's back up to 88mph again, a flash of light later and we're in 2013.The Monstrous  Sea Creatures emerging from the ""Pacific Rim"" have failed to take out ""One Direction"" and in a desperate attempt to free our airwaves from the ironically titled ""Best Song Ever"" Disney released a counter attack by way of Princess Elsa begging these Guns N Roses replacements to ""Let It Go"" ****** This information may be slightly inaccurate as I fell asleep during Pacific Rim and went outside to ""build a snowman"" shortly after Frozen started.It Grows if you Play with it.The other big news of 2013 was the release of Cities in Motion 2. The BIGGER is BETTER sequel to the previous transportation sim. It was prettier, the maps were much larger and your transportation decisions would impact city growth.Whilst still only a transport sim and not a city builder this was another great game in the franchise.1,2,3,4.....errr...1The other, other big news of 2013 was the release of SimCity.Yes I know we started our time travelling journey witnessing the birth of SimCity back in 1989, but it seems that,  despite spawning 3 sequels over the interceding years, a meeting was held by shady men of power where they discussed what they could possibly call the next game in the SimCity Franchise.They'd already had SimCity, SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, SimCity 4 (I assume they'd dropped the three zeros because they thought their audience incapable of counting up in 1000 increments any further.....)  so they came up with SimCity 5.I speculate that It was at this point one of them decided that the One Direction haggled minds of the current generation could not be expected to count all the way to 5.... so they decided to drop the number off the game title all together and SimCity was reborn!Sham CityAnd what a rebirth it was, not since Elsa had taken off her gloves and started freezing everything she touched like a frigid version of Gold Finger had such outrage been  seen.You had to be online all the time to play the game,  their servers were overloaded so you often couldn't play at all! (both of these issues were fixed later)  but most importantly, the maps were tiny, tiny things with very little room for the one thing this game was supposed to be about, City Building.On The Road AgainIt's time to charge the flux capacitor one last time, we're going home!It's 2015, Not content with their domination of the airwaves, One Direction are on tour.A public warning has been issued labelled  ""On the Road Again""The announcement includes the groups  whereabouts and an anticipated timeline to allow the general public to avoid several high risk locations, which are often large venues where people would normally gather, despicable.Anyway,  the Bigger news of 2015 is that the city builder is back!City Building Games are like Buses.You wait for years for one to come along and then two arrive at the same time.Firstly we've had the release of Cities XXL, a competent  city builder in its own right, but much like many of One Directions songs, it's almost an  exact copy of what came before it.This hasn't gone down well with people already exposed to that particular franchise, if you've heard one song, you've heard them all, right?And now we have Cities Skylines, but is this the salvation of the city building genre we've all been hoping for ?A Little MisunderstandingWhen I first fired up Cities Skylines I was immediately filled with disappointment.It was pretty, it seemed to have all the features I could want in a city builder, but the map size was tiny, SimCity 5000 tiny.The same white dotted line marked out the edges of the postage stamp sized buildable area as I'd butted against in SimCity so many times before.... but I was wrong!Game ChangerYou can't imagine my relief when I realised I could purchase new plots of land to expand my fledgling  metropolis.The map is in fact huge, you can buy and unlock land to expand out not only in ""One Direction"" but in which ever direction you choose!I swear I've never felt such relief when playing a game before.It was like finding out that Guns N Roses hadn't really been taken down by aliens, It wasn't only an amazing discovery, it was a game changer!Cities In MotionAs you would expect from a developer who's previous titles have been transportation management sims, the transportation mechanics in Skylines are excellent.You can place bus stops, set up bus routes, implement a tube system, play with trains and even boats. The public transport system is so fully realised and well implemented I really can't fault it.Cities In Motion TooRoads aren't neglected either.There's plenty of choice between different road sizes, one way systems, Yes, you can set streets up so cars can only go in ""One Direction"" (Best Pun Ever*) , roundabouts etc. All there waiting to help solve your traffic problems by way of substituting them with the problems of noise pollution instead.(*Best Pun Ever, may have been the  hidden bonus track released by the unexplainably popular boy band - reports are unconfirmed but it does seem to relate to the noise pollution issue). <snip>( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/ )			"

												One of the best city building games of all time in my opinion. I've gotten more time out of this than Simcity as a whole (in the same span of time) and I still love it. Great workshop compatibility, graphics, and mechanics. Some things could definitely be improved but I feel like the workshop is already on all of that. WAY better than any other equivalent. Also, I can't believe this game is made in Unity! Doesn't run that well on larger cities but is still runs better than any other city builder. It actually simulates everthing, the roads are way better, huge maps, resources, much better traffic AI than other games (not to say that you can just draw grids everywhere and not expect traffic, you still have to use a 6-4-2 method). Roads tools are great and fun and aesthatically appealing.			"

												First time review but felt compelled to about this game. If you are a fan of the whole tycoon, city building genre then Cities SKylines is for you.The support of the product through the workshop is like a treasure trove filled with replica buildings, unique designs and detailed assets which allow you to craft almost anything you can imagine within your city.The mods can be a little bit frustrating and dangerous to your save games but handled correctly (I'd highly recommend reading about the mods you are thinking about using in the workshop before downloading any) they add even more oppotunities to develop the gameplay, fixing minor frustrations and adding more simplitic and unique controls.If you are new to the genre then this is an excellent game to start from. Great value, it was only £22 when it first came out, and an even better workshop, this gane will suck you in for hours.			"

												Remember simcity 2013? Yea this is basicly that but not a huge disapointment. I have been playing simcity for many years, and I am sure that I am not the only one that was very unpelased with simcity 2013. Was it horrible? Nah, but it was not as good as it should be. Cities Skylines is the modern city builder I have been looking for. No city restrictions and no online DRM BS. The game allows you to build insansly large cities, and the modding community is already pushing out some really cool stuff, especialy with the asset and map editor being a thing.  It does not have the same kind of quarkyness that simcity has, and wont have the same kind of random events, but it is satisfying to watch the city grow.My only real problem with the game is that it does not tailor it's self way to new players. If you are new to the city building genre then be prepared to fail a lot, as this game will punish you for the smallest of mistakes. If you are like me and been wanting a great modern version of simcity then this is for you, along with the modding community I would definetly say that this game is well worth 30 bucks.			"

												Considering the success of Cities In Motion, I had high hopes for this game.Boy, was I wrong...This game is absolutely amazing. It runs really well, looks good and looks to have great modding potential in future. Little details like the water backing up behind a dam, swaying electricity wires etc make this game look fantastic. It's everything that SimCity should've been and more.The towns look small when you first start, but be rest assured you can grow a city up to 6x6km in a Prison Architect style land purchasing method. This is pretty much rivalling Cities XL in terms of raw city size.Overall, 10/10			"

												I can say without playing sim city that this is one of the most accurate city sims out therepros:- it's visually appealing- it comes at half the price of sim city!- Frame rates are low, but managable- you can point out individual things like people, animals, and cars and check stats or change stats- Controls are easy- allows for steam community creations- the developers are bug fixing the game regularlycons:- directions are a bit vague- lack of explanation for each problem- no city disasters like floods or tornados- some situations are played out to easilyI would give it a solid 8.7I think it would be a good tool for real city builders!

												This is an exceptionally straight forward game, very much dumbed down. Your control in what develops is very limited but the game is very beautiful and the flow is quite nicely.

												The Sim City we never had, but deserved. This game is awesome and if you like City Builders, there is no way around this game. The best feature is the districts, where you can apply policies only to that rather than your whole city to adress individual problems such as high traffic or fires. Launch is also pretty much bug free. One thing I do not like, is that you don't unlock various street sizes until later on. I like to plan out my cities before and changing all the streets requires some serious work.  But it is doable. Putting down streets is pretty awesome, since the game shows you how much space you actually do need for RCI.			"

												""Suffice it to say that I believe this game is worth the asking price of $29.99.  It’s very easy to spend hours/days/months on a single map and fine-tune it to your liking, which is a tremendous value.  The fact that it supports a map editor and Steam Workshop is all the more reason why the price tag is more than generous.  Some may see “Cities: Skylines” as a “SimCity” clone, but honestly, who cares?  If we put aside the fact that the former does things the latter doesn’t do, there aren’t enough stable and fun city-management games out on the market, so why complain?  I, for one, am finally grateful for a current-gen city-builder that not only actually does the job correctly, but goes above and beyond my expectations.""Full Review: http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/cities-skylines/---

												This game is worth its money threefold. Remember SimCity 2013?Yeah you probably do because it was chockfull of bugs and annoyances, however you still enoyed it didn't you?I had the same. Some of those annoyances weren't small however. The maximum land size was one of them. A measly 2x2 KM block of land was ALL you could get in SimCity 2013. Now you might ask why do I bring up SimCity? Because, obviously, this game is a lot like SimCity (who would have guessed!) except it doesn't have its flaws. This game is, in my eyes, by far the best city builder since Simcity 4. One of the biggest issues with Simcity 2013 was the plot size. Well guess what, this game can be 8 times larger at the very least and 24 times larger with a simple mod! That's also part of the exquisite beauty of this game; mods. This game fully suppors modding if you didn't figure it out already. There's already several thousands mods on the Workshop, and that number is expanding by the hour! Another big issue in this game was traffic, even though traffic behaves mostly the same, from what I've seen/played/heard/read the traffic is much more manageable in here, simply because you can expand your cities, easily upgrade your roads and build intricate intersections, overpasses and so forth. Something new this game has is called 'Districts'. Districts carry a load of potential, as they can specialise your chosen area to a certain type of Industry, limit your density of Residential, Industry or Commercial Zones and put certain Policies per District. It is quite a bit slower than Simcity 2013 though, don't expect to hit 400.000 citizens within 5 or 6 hours, your city builds up slowly. One of the main complaints I've seen is that cities seem much more populated than the civ number, this is because the civ number shown is the actual number of simulated agents. The actual people you might see is probably quite a bit higher. I have no idea whether or not this review makes a lot of sense to you, but if it does, be sure to check this great and time-consuming game out because DAMN is it awesome.			"

												You don't need a ton of time in this game to truly understand how good this game is. Long story short - if you're a fan of SimCity 1 and SimCity 4 and were dissapointed with SimCity 2013 - this is what you've waited for. You can say that this game is community called Sim City 5, because this is more of Sim City that Sim City 2013. It playes well, it runs well, maps are huge and expandable, it's sometimes hard, but as soon as you get used to it- you're good to go. Yet it lacks some non critical stuff, like terraforming in Mayor mode and day and night cycle. I really desire to see those implemented in future updates if that is even possible. Everything else is a mix of SimCity 1 and 4 with tons of cool additions, like districts, resource system, sound pollution, few new services, it's a great mix i must admit. Developers also care about modmakers, they supplied us with object editor, map editor and implemented steam workshop, this will give a huge lifespan to this game. It's also not that expensive, so if you really want to get the best city building simulator for this year - this is your choice.			"

												Was one of my favourite games until it was ruined by the Snowfall DLC and free update which broke most of the core game mechanics, and the developers taking the decision to degrade the graphics (LOD distance and such) for no apparent reason resulting in a very blurry game (assuming it was to improve performance).If only rollbacks were possible. It was a good game on Day 1 but it has went downhill since with prominent issues not being fixed, pointless/cosmetic DLC being introduced, and the community being mostly ignored by the developers. Paradox Interactive staff have been brilliant with offering support/help for the game, it's just a shame they are acting as the middleman between the end user and the developers.Until the core game mechanics are fixed, I will not be recommending this to future buyers.EDIT: As of now it seems that the Developers have almost completely abandoned this game and ran off with their money. I'll never buy another game from Colossal Order.			"

												The game all MP's, councils and their contractors should do part of their mandatory training on. You ask why? Well here goes:Road capacity in Truro (Cornwall) is really bad.Cities Skylines solution: Use the road upgrade tool to widen road or make road one way. Traffic flow improves, tax revenue improves and happieness increases.Local council solution: Remove a lane and make it a bus lane! Traffic gridlock, buses cant get to bus lane due to traffic, happieness decreases, business revenue decreases, then council scraps bus lane at a cost of £60k. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-34883680If only they had played this game maybe they could have got it right.............

												I've never felt the need to review a game before, as I tend to play casually and don't really have much to add, but given the enjoyment I'm getting from this game I felt I needed to review.The game, for me, is simply what the SimCity series should have evolved into - it's intuitive, whilst still requiring brain power to plan your city (everything from where the buses stop, tax rates and budget, right down to putting trees next to roads to reduce noise pollution) - the biggest selling point however is the available real estate to build on, which I feel has been sorely lacking in recent city building games.  You start with a fairly decent sized square of land and can expand this out into a sprawling metropolis - giving you the satisfaction of seeing your efforts bloom into a real ""city"" rather than just an increasily busy, small square.Others have covered far more in-depth than I have - but from my point of view, as a casual player who likes to dip and out of the game, slowly building up a city that I can see previous efforts and decisions continue to impact, the game is an absolute winner.Highly recommend it!

												If you like Sim City 4, you will also like Cities Skylines.Not everything is very obvious at first and things will not work on the first try, but it's very easy to completely redesign large areas in your city. Exploring new techniques and unlocking more and more buildings is a ton of fun.It has a sophisticated goods cycle, where you earn more taxes if goods are produced inside your city, from resources harvested in your city. The Cims can be seen chilling in parks, using public transportation etc, which looks fantastic. On German it could be said that the games has a high ""Wuselfaktor"".Highly recommended!			"

												I really wish there was a neutral, or recommend with reservations choice for reviews. Cities: Skylines is promising, but I'm not totally enamored with it. I feel bad for saying this because the people at Paradox Interactive seem like a cool group of people. I'm pleased it has done so well for them in such a short period of time. I hope it leads to further improvements! CO seems interested in gathering feedback on the forums.Skylines does many things right - ease of road construction, traffic modeling, and the city builder basics. By far the aspect I enjoyed most was building roads and watching the traffic. I don't get into the creative aspect of city building, so my contentment comes from overcoming challenges provided by a detailed simulation. I need to feel like traffic problems matter more than they do in Skylines. People should be mad when traffic prevents them from arriving at their destination. Businesses should shut down if their workers never arrive. I didn't really have money issues, which maybe would be solved by using the hard mode mod. It is a pretty beginner-friendly game, so don't expect a great challenge out of the box.I think creative types would get more out of the game then I do, and beginners to the genre are given a warm fuzzy hug. My negative comments aside, I do think it is the best of the 'traditional' city builder type of games - the new SimCity and Cities XL. It's also kept my interest longer than Banished due to the interesting road building in Skylines. By their nature, city builders can get repetitive and I don't have a high tolerance for that.I hope the game gets a lot of post release support, and Paradox has a great track record when it comes to that. Maybe after some updates my opinion will be a little more positive. My full review [www.oneguytoomanygames.com]with more details is available.			"

												Damn it, this game is so good, every time I start it with the mantra only to fix a bit of my city's issues, I keep playing it for hours.It has a few problems, but it's only minor stuff that does not affect the gameplay or even the playability.So if you want to have a fun, motivating city builder with lots of mods(hehe) and map, then this is your choice.Just watching your cims live in your city is extremely satisfying.10/10 would get addicted again.

												City Skylines is what Sim City 4 should have been. Paradox has done a great job on this guy and continues to support it with DLC and new features. If you like city builders this game will ruin evey other one for you by setting the new gold standard, What few beefs I have with the game are easily remedied by mods which the creators fully endorse and a slew of mod authors with materials, for example not being able to unlock every tile on the map, not sure why they restricted that, performace maybe, but there is a mod for that. With the exceptioon of multi player (not a feature I look for in city builders) I can't think of a single feature missing at this point assuming you have all the DLC.Graphically it is pretty good, not going to win awards but still one of the if not the best looking city builder I have played. Able to controll traffic routs above and below ground if you wish. I honestly cannot think of too many bad things to say about this game, If I was to bring up one point of contention I do think the crime is unrealistically low, but it hasn't annoyed me to the point of finding a mod to fix it. I am not a huge City builder player (looking at my hours played on this compared to RPGs) but I do like this one alot and come back to it when I need a mellow game to play.			"

												Technically it is an impressive city simulation, you will have fun building stuff and watching your city grow.  But after the initial wow factor, I am finding it rather shallow in terms of challenge.  There are a lot of tax tweaking options but i've never had to touch them, I have a very healthy income whatever I do.  Where are the problems faced by mayors?  People are asking for help on how to get the crime rate above 50% achievement - this shouldn't be something people need help with, it should be easy to make happen just through bad city management.  I wish my doctors would go on strike, or that a riot would happen, or that schools demanded a bigger budget.  Even the wind reducing a bit during certain seasons would give me a challenge because my city is powered 100% by clean wind power.  Skylines just makes running a city seem too easy.I hope this initial release is kind of a ""here it is, be creative and build things"" and that future expansions will add some extra layers that start to challenge us.

												Cities: Skylines is a city builder developed by Colossal Order, the guys who were responsible for making the Cities in Motion series, and published by Paradox Interactive, and I have to say this is hands down the best city builder we’ve ever had on Steam .The size of the game is astonishing, by default the game features a 36km^2 map which is almost ten times the size of the map we’re given in SimCity 2013, and with the help of mods from the Steam Workshop, this can be expanded to a mind boggling 100km^2. Even though there are no interactions between cities that are on different maps, it is frankly not necessary, with the help of the powerful yet easy to use building tool, you can build multiple cities on a single map.Despite its humongous size, the developers paid close attention to details, in fact, detail is the word I’ll use to describe this game. From the entire traffic network, down to individual citizens, every aspect in Cities: Skylines are properly simulated. You’ll find lorries, colour coded depending on what they are currently carrying, delivering their cargoes to their designated factories, citizen actually living in a permanent home, and ambulances rushing to accident scenes, then little paramedics will get out of their vehicle, and few seconds later return with a patient on a stretcher. I also love how water works in this game as well as the fluid physics, it is completely unnecessary to have it in a city builder but in this case it has added so much more to the experience. Water has currents and flows, so you'll want to pump water on the upstream and set up sewage pipes on the opposite end, else you’ll start pumping polluted sewage water back into the system. You can even drain a lake dry completely, or accidentally flooding your city because you demolished a dam, playing with water has never been so fun. This is a city builder perfected, and with the support of Steam Workshop, further enriched by the endless creativity of the community. Cities: Skylines is a must buy for anyone who has the slightest interest in city builders.			"

												This is one of the games that you don't regret after you paid. The Dev Crew was small and they did not expect this accomplishment. Now they are growing! and if there is any plan to make the Cities:Skylines 2, I bet it will be much better than this.Now let's take a closer look to the features, pros & cons;PROSGame allows you to create your own maps, map themes, assets, mods and color corrections(LUTs). -Workshop Support-Dynamic water system by water source spawn points for rivers. -So you'll be able to build dams, water pumps and purification facilities.Free updates are satisfying. -I do not reccommend you to buy DLCs for few features-Road Tools are good enough. -such as 'straight', 'curve', 'Free-form', 'upgrade/degrade'-Natural Resources -coil ore, fossil oil, fertile land-Dynamic Wind -affected by height and sea-Day/night cycleIn-game landscaping options and decorations.Auto import-export according to the needs.Functional harbors & train stations for each, tourism and industry.CONSYou can fix lots of the problems that listed below with assets and mods from workshop but each one of em will reduce your game's performance cuz they re not vanilla featuresDevs did not reseach and observe good enough about roads, city planning, buildings, textures and colors.(ie: minimum bridge height is 12mts -Without crossing the lamps of the road under the bridge- etc)Road types are not enough. - Road junction angles are too big (min:45 degrees) - Road transitions are too sharp/short between large and small roads. - No merged road ramps. - Bumpy bridges upon water.Building zoning sizes are the same for low and high density unlikely Cities XL (max: 4x4 units = 32mtsx32mts)Building textures and models are not so realistic -some of em a little bit futuristic-Building types are not enough.Surface polycount of the landscape is not enough to detail it.Too saturated and low quality textures.Hope it helps. Have Fun. "

												I've played a lot of city builders in my time but I can honestly say that City Skylines is the city builder game that I have waited years for. It's such a smooth game to play. It runs like a throughly tested, well polished game. The vibrant colors and excellent soundtrack in the game instantly puts me in the mood to build my dream city. The game tools provides one with an abundance of creativity. So much so that I felt overwhelmed with all that I am able to do. I'm only limited by my imagination not the game mechanics which is awesome! Some of my favorite aspects of the game is the simulated people, yes folks each little pixlated person is an indivisual in City Skylines! I love the water dynamics and how they can create a challenge which adds to gameplay and not take away from it. I love all of the transportation options with more types promised in the future. I love the soundtrack and if I had only one regret, it was not getting in on that pre-order offer to get it.  But what I love most, is the potential of this game through the modding community. This game is built with modding in mind. Can you imaging the many props and gameplay mods that will flow from the talented modders for this game? I can hardly wait, and guess what? The modders are already making assets and gamemods for Cities as you read this. I honestly can't praise this game enough. If you are interested in City Builders and you've been burned by other games, look no further. Cities will most likely satisfy everything you've ever wanted in a city builder game. I whole heartily reccommend City Skylines.  :)			"

												I've never played a city simulation game before, but this one is apparently considered one of the best, and I had fun playing it. You can be anally involved in the tiniest details of traffic organization, or spend the entire game in god-view 1000ft above the city. At first you will mess up and make rookie mistakes in city planning, but helpful tutorials and obnoxious pop-up messages will have you learning quickly. There is a downside to being successful though. For the end game buildings (Monuments), you must build a variety of Unique Buildings, half of them only being awarded to you for being bad at the game. For example; high unemployment, massive trash buildup,  high crime, poor health, and many abandoned buildings. You must deliberately ruin your city to get these last buildings, which sucks. The rest of the buildings however, are simply unlocked from population checkpoints. When you're not worrying about handicapping your city, you'll be scratching your head on how to solve the various problems that crop up, two examples being trash and pollution. See, citizens need trash services, but these buildings only cover a very small area, and create pollution. Thus, you have trash burning facilities inside the neighborhood- which cause people to get sick from the pollution. No matter how many Health services you have near the area, people still get sick and die, and there's nothing to fix it other than by creating gaps where nobody lives. Now mind you, mods can fix these inconsistences, but the devs punish you for using any mods by locking you out from earning achievements entirely. In conclusion, Cities:Skylines is a competent and fun city sim. It has some problems, many of which can be fixed by mods, but in doing so you are not allowed to earn achievements. The progression in end-game is flawed, but the rest of the game is steady and engaging.Also, apparently the Deluxe Edition doesn't come with ANY of the DLC.			"

But made with 11-13 people at Colossal Order.1) No persistent DRM/online mode (unless you count Steam as one)2) Full Steam workshop integration and mod support.3) Developers are not worried over people pirating this game.Just the staggering amount of workshop items being created in less than a month really says something.I fully support the developers and publishers in this game, and would encourage anyone on the fence to buy this game & play it, as a big F U to EA.

												I have been waiting to play a more modern version of Sim City 4 for a long time and this game truly delivers, with the more modern and easy to read interfaces and overlays so you can very quickly spot areas that are lacking in services and tons of new features make Cities: Skylines an awesome city building experience.With a huge area to work with you are free to make a single vast sprawling metropolis or small interconnected towns, the ease of use and the space actually allowed me to use the curve and free form road tools as I didnt feel the need to pack everything in to a boring grid structure so my cities look a lot more interesting as well. Visually its a very colourful game with a really cool aesthetic that makes it a pleasure to look at from every angle, there are tons of little details in the city as well.There is even an almost puzzle solving element to the game, figuring out traffic. It is incredibly satisfying when you find the solution to your traffic problem and then just watching everything smoothly and quickly get around your city. I was amazed when I followed a Cim who walked to a train station, travelled to the next city over, got a connecting train, then a bus all to get to his work on the complete opposite side of the huge map. It is incredibly fun and satisfying just watching your city unfold in its daily business.While there are a few minor flaws and issues that could be fixed or improved, like the ability to hide or show only certain transport routes to make editing them easier, the fun and enjoyable gameplay completly blows any issues away. Future free updates are already promised and with modding support I think I will be playing Skylines for a long time to come.It's easy to quickly lose a lot of time and get completly absorbed in this game, absolutly fantastic, highly recommended.

												I find myself challenged to write an objective review because I am absolutely in the clouds with this game. So, although I am somewhat biased, I can wholeheartedly recommend Cities: Skylines to any avid simulation gamer. The UI is quite intuitive and because of all the available mods and options, you have precize control on how you want to play the game in regards of economics, traffic managing and map design. If you are looking for a particular feature, the workshop is your best friend with thousands of mods and assets.A word of caution about minimal system recommendations, the better your rig, the more you will be able to get the most out of this game when it comes to actual gameplay and not just pretty looks or resolution. I have a 32 RAM, GTX 980ti accompanied with a 4770K CPU. At the moment I have 533 mods and assets installed and it takes about 7 minutes to load a new map. A saved game might be slightly longer but I haven't clocked that.I set all the graphics to max and after the first few hours I was forced to lower the settings slightly because the game began to bog down. A few more hours in and I have to experiment again with my settings because the larger the city, the more heavily your hardware will be challenged. Which is only logic, but I found that with one small street of extra industries or housing added can make the game from running smoothly to the commenly known tack-tack-tack motion the cars will be displayed while driving.It's easy to a add high amount of mods and assets, but it does ask for some insight on the player's side. Because sooner or later you will run into mods that aren't up to date or conflict with other mods. So if you're not too experienced or just can't be bothered, use these sparsely.Recommended because:- Precize control on indepth game mechanics and economics- Stunning graphics- Huge amounts of mods and assets available- Highly detailed and immersive- Quite addicting. Feels like time in real life flies by as fast as in the gamePoints of critic:- Gameplay experience depend quite heavy on up to date hardware- Mods and assets will sooner or later cause conflicts- Quite addicting. Feels like time in real life flies by as fast as in the game- Railway and harbour feels very basic and more of an afterthought			"

												Finally, a city simulator that has everything we want and nothing we don't.  This game captures the essence of what has been missing in the genre since the days of SimCity 4 (though 3000 has always been my favorite).  The districting tool is fantastic and adds a new element that really makes your city yours.  The city details are every bit as good as SimCity 5, but the game is smooth as silk, and the maps are far larger and even more visually appealing.   No stupid patches every time I log in or online always requirements here.  I cannot wait to see what the community is going to create for this game.  The only negative I see is that sometimes there are mismatches between building names and what they look like (e.g. a laminate floor factory is named ""Burger World"" etc.).  The interfaces are intuitive and slick, and the city progression will keep any gamer interested in pursuing city growth to higher and higher limits for days if not weeks.  Nice work here all around.  This game is being added to the favorite stack.			"

												Very nice city building game.  A bit more on the casual side, but with a very nice style and feeling.  It tends to be more of a traffic simulator at times.  Like the fact they get only want to use one lane out of six on wide streets is a real letdown.  But the rest of the game is good enough you can overlook that.  I really hope the devs patch that in the near future.  I give it 8/10 (would be higher if they fix traffic)			"

												I haven't been able to sit down and play a city sim in a long time.  All the ones that I actually like are pretty dated, and the older UIs usually prevent me from having any fun.  Cities Skylines is different.  Most the strategy comes from road building where traffic is your major enemy.  This makes prudent planning vitally important and means you can kind of skip over the micro-managing (if you wish, but there are plenty of options too).  I've spent hours in a sandbox-city with infinite money just designing highway interchanges and had fun doing it!The game is beautiful, and with the workshop integration the possibilities are endless.  I'd recommend this to any city builder fan.			"

												It lacks the depth and realism of the old SimCity series. This game is very easy, build any common-sense city and you will be rolling in tax income with no budgetary, social, or infrastructure problems whatsoever. The buildings and vehicles are cartoony and look like candy. Certain mechanics are poorly thought-out, such as the optional day-night cycle disabling solar power plants and the ridiculous six-lane roads causing more problems than they solve. The DLC packs add one or two useful features, usually transportation-related, but are padded with otherwise useless content. Public saunas, really? This is not stuff real city governments are concerned with.Still, it's an impressive engine with some surprisingly intricate modeling, such as the waterworks and traffic simulation. But if you were expecting the next-generation SimCity 4 with countless hours of challenges, urban intrigue, and entertainment, prepare to be disappointed. It's a mildly interesting antfarm that happens to be the only city-building game on the market right now.			"

												For over ten years fans of city building games have been met with disapointed after disapointment for anything that tried to capture the greatness that was Sim City 4 (where by knonw as SC4). Sure you have Tropico and like games but they just are not the same, you are building an island nation, instead of zoning you are plopping everything down, much like Sim City Societies which flopped for that very reason (See the paragraph below). For ten years these fans have wonder though the wastelands waiting for a true sucessor to SC4, first came Sim City Societies but it was much like SIm Town, a game where you just placed everything down much to the distaste of anyone who wanted to zone the land and watch as the sims took up shop and resident in to the city. You also had the Cities X(X)L sersies (by NO WAY related to this game, the devs of this game made Cities in Motion). WHose frequent bugs, non working code, and failed promases time after time left a bitter taste in these fans mouths. The dev of Cities X(X)L have a habbit of just releasing the same game year after year full of the same bugs. Then you have SIm City 2013 (aka Sim City 5) This failure of a game was due to many reasons, the inability of EA knowing what made Sim City a sucessful and much loved sersies. Instead of sharing our creations with the world we had to now play againts the world (when it worked!) and always be online which was a ""tenchinal limitation"" (until it wasn't) The failure of the glassbox engine to actually simulate things outside of poop was also an issue (Those who are going to say it simulated more then that I know, I am making a point). So today brings us Cities: Skylines a phenox in the burt ashes of hopes and dreams. Even if the phenox is a circular blue bird who chirps out what sim..I mean cims are thinking it is still a job well done by CO. Although basic in many levels as opposed to SC4 it is a much needed refresh form this small studio, I expect many great things to come in updates, patches and DLC.			"

												Start by imagining EA / Maxis' catastrophic 2013 edition of SimCity. Replace the entire broken simulation engine with something that actually works and scales well. Make the map bigger and massively expandable. Throw in a whole bucket of small ""why didn't anyone think of THAT before?"" features that aren't quite transformative but deliver enough of an impact to get you grinning ear to ear.Oh, and divide the launch price by two. Voila! You have Cities: Skylines.While this is not quite a genre-defining, groundbreaking upgrade over the 12-year-old SimCity 4 (it still lacks region play and inter-city trading), it manages to build on most of that legendary title's major milestones while also replicating almost entirely the presentational charms of its botched sequel. The game has its fair share of mild annoyances, most of which involve the way its massive piles of data are presented to the player, but it speaks volumes that one of its greatest issues is how difficult it is to praise it without comparing it to SimCity.Maxis is dead. Long live Colossal Order. A tiny studio from Finland (with a hilarious CEO) has accomplished a feat that previously eluded more illustrious development teams for more than a decade. Cities: Skylines is a must-buy for genre newcomers and SimCity veterans alike, and it will likely go down as an instant classic and the new high water mark for urban planning sims.			"

												Do you remember being excited by the SimCity remake? That feeling of ""wow this is going to be great, a modern take on city building""? Do you remember the sheer disappointment that was experienced when you discovered that you not only had to queue for hours after purchasing the day, it was online only? EA at the time said it was because their Agenting System Glassbox was doing intricate calculations and that most PCs couldn't handle it. Of course, that turned out to be rubbish. Anyway, do you remember being locked down to your 2x2km area and wishing you didn't have to exit to the region and start a new city? With Cities: Skylines, Collosal draws upon those promises and excels. Building from their Transportation simulator, this game is the modern city builderthat you wanted. That isn't to say that it is perfect. There are stil some odd UI design choices and other input designs, but it does all those things that it was claimed SimCity couldn't do.  Today, I followed a citizen in a car. He was uneducated, and going home to his house in his district. He also had a dog. Then he went to work a convenience store. After work, he went back to the same address in the same car with the same dog. There is no slowdown in my experience, but I haven't built a huge city either. From what I can tell the game does provide a challenge and it also has that cool ""tilt-shift"" camera perspective that was used in SimCity. The game is gorgeous. Not only that but there is a terrain editor and an asset editor built in. For the money, you get a lot of value. Also there is still room for DLC! Special things no doubt which would only add to the game. Oh, did I mention that the game features left and right hand driving? I think there is also a multiplayer mode. With the asset editor you can build your own road configurations. So instead of just dragging out streets, You can just place predefined Streets. Want to build your own intersection? You can. Want to build your own park? You can do that as well! There is also SteamWorkshop from the start. You can download whatever you want. Built a cool map of London or Johannesburg? You can do that. Because while yes you are intiially restricted to 2x2km of building space, You can purchase more lots of land up to an official 6x6km map size. This is 3 times the size of SimCity Maps! The game contains so much more value than SimCities or Cities XL/XXL. You might think it would be very expensive, but the price is more than reasonable. In fact the devs could easily have charged twice, and I still would have gotten it.I am terrible at city builders, but needed to have an itch scratched. This game does juat that! Pick this game up today!			"

Cities: Skylines is one of the best city builders out there.  In my opinion it's not the best but it's still very good.  Sim builders are subjective so this game may be very good for a player or boring depending on how you like to play builders.  The reason it doesn't appeal to me is because this game concentrates more on management than simply plotting down buildings.  There are some buildings and items you can plot down like DLC content, parks, emergency buildings, schools, water and power management, etc.  But skyscrapers, houses and other common buildings you can't pick from a menu and place it.  Most of the building area is managed by zoning off areas (residential, commercial, office, industry).  In other words, depending on how well you run your city will determine how many buildings and homes your city residents build.  If you don't have enough educated people or zoned neighborhoods then businesses will not build up.  If you don't have enough jobs people will move out.  If either one is neglected too long then buildings shut down and you have to demolish them to make your city appealing.  I will say that the road customization and mechanics of the game is pretty good.  Some of the DLCs look very impressive but I've not bought them.  The Natural Disasters DLC looks like it'd spice up the games some.In a nutshell: If you like city management and like the city to build itself then you'll love this game. If you like to pick buildings and other structures from a menu to place at your heart's desire and not worry so much about the management stuff I recommend Sim City from EA.Pros:Great city builderRoads cusomizations are on pointManagement - for those who like a challengeGood graphicsWorkshop itemsUnlimited money option - for those who just want to buildDLC contentSteam cloud save - if you get a new PC you'll be thankful for this!Cons:More of a management game, not enough picking structures from a list and freely placing them.Music could be better.Sometimes the game goes after you about one problem and it seems nothing fixes it.  For example, I felt like I had to keep building schools because my citizens were uneducated. After about a dozen schools I was done...just over it. And my city was still very small.  My first game had a similar problem, public health. Had to keep building more and more clinics.  This could be a problem without unlimited money turned on.			"

												I don't know what to think about this game... It's good... but not entirely... It came out soon after sim city failure so i guess you know why it got so popular. I've played it for a while and i'm disappointed. There's no target of this game. You can get highest tier of city in no time, money is very easy to get and it becomes boring after a while. But the game itself is good. It's very friendly for mods(which are cool) you can make a nice city but i'm really missing a target in this game. someone could say that you don't need a target in game like that... well... true but if you played a very old game called City Life(there's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ remake of it on steam) you know that trying to get everyone happy, employed and get every group of people is very fun. That game was making you strugle to get that 1% of snobs and so on. in Tropico 4 you also have targets and it makes it a fun game(would be pretty boring without it). so you get me by now. its just a pointless city builder. it's not even economical game(like a lot of city builders). So building cities. it's pretty good. you have to provide water, electronics(not by making a building but with pipes and wires), you have to take rid of trash, road traffics, you've got airports, buses, metro(or tubes ya british ♥♥♥♥♥♥s), pretty much everything. So in overall - pointless but very good city builder                                6.5/10(just for being pointless)			"

												I was an avid fan of the SimCity franchise all the way back to SimCity on SNES when Will Wright was the developer. I had my pet peeves with SimCity 4 and was very much so looking forward to SimCity 6 (2013) which ended up being an EXTREME disappointment and should have been called SimTown instead. I was finding myself completing a City in less than 2 hours, and got so frustrated with the game that I took to their Facebook page and left a rather lengthy post that hundreds of others seemed to share the same feelings in regards to the lack of attention put into the game.Then comes Cities: Skylines. My girlfriend actually purchased a copy for me as a gift and I had my eye on it for awhile, just never made the purchase because I didn't have time to play (full-time developer).I can honestly say this is everything that SimCity SHOULD have been, or at least what EA Games promised us it would be.-> [ Steam Workshop ]The steam workshop is the HUGE seller for me. Almost any building, tool and mod is available to integrate into the game. I have well over 200 addons packed into my game, and almost an endless supply of buildings I can place, which ensures my city doesn't look the same everywhere. This is probably my FAVORITE thing about the game, is the huge support for this game through the workshop.-> [ Detailed Building Tools ]Everything from the terrain tools, the different types of roads you can place, and the ability to toggle the grid system on/off makes it possible to pretty much create anything you want. No two cities should look alike if you truly utilize the tools you are given.-> [ Sandbox Mode ]When I play these simulators, I don't like going through and playing the scenarios and having to watch my money. This game gives me the ability to have an unlimited source of money, and just build away. -> [ Game Engine ]Everything is beautiful in regards to the games appearance and performance. FPS is extremely smooth, and the entire city looks amazing (especially at night with the lights on). I haven't ran into any bugs, and I can pretty much crank the graphics up to ultra for everything, and the level of detail is very very real.-> [ Traffic ]It is relatively easy to control traffic in this game. You just have to map out where your dense traffic is going to be, and adjust accordingly with the right roads, and the other methods of transportation are great as well! (Bus, airport, tram, etc).I did find one minor annoyance. It appears that Sims get sick quite frequently, especially in a highly populated city. Theirs almost never a moment where I don't hear an ambulance screaming past me where I'm building.  In fact one time, I was just browsing the city, and one of my main busy roads had 17 ambulances one after another, going to different calls... that's a little excessive.... I don't even see them that much in Los Angeles...Overall, it's a great game, and definitely worth the price. I think the DLCs are a little over-priced for what they provide, but that's certainly not a reason to not by the game.It looks like EA Games is no longer the king of City Simulators.Regards,RichardYouTube: IAMRichardT			"

Cities: Skylines is currently the best city building simulator. It sure isn't difficult but extremely fun. The game has so much content to offer so just let your imagination do the rest and build your own dream city. Besides, if you want to add even more variety you're always free to download mods and assets from the steam workshop. Things like unique buildings, props, vehicles and other additions will enhance your gaming experience by a huge amount. In my opinion, I'd say that the game isn't perfect but you can make it near-perfect by using different mods to fill the gaps. For example, the traffic management is so tricky and poor that sometimes you feel like playing traffic simulator but with the help of mods you can solve this problem much easier.The maps are enormous and can be increased in size even more via mods. It may take dozens or more hours to finish the city, especially, if you're making it look pretty and pay attention to small details and not just the population. Speaking of details, the game looks polished in high-up view and even while you're zoomed in all the way (or using first person camera mod).I've been nagging about mods the whole review, meaning, that the incorporation of workshop was the best approach to make this game by far the best city building simulator that you can currently get. But beware, having a lot of mods result in huge FPS drop!10/10 "

												Cities: Skylines, is easily one of the best modern takes on the city builder genre in a long time and just crushes Simcity 5 in terms of the agent system and simulation model. It is lacking in terms of finer controls and mid to late game changes, but the modding support has been great and the game is only going to get bigger with future content and DLC.If you're looking for something incredibility difficult to build and maintain like in Banished, Skylines isn't it. It's more about sandbox play and letting the player do what they want, but again all that could change with DLC and continued support. This would also be a great entry into city building or something to show kids the basic steps of city management and planning.			"

												Much as I like to give every distraction remain focused a chance to affirm, certain diversions request examinations. By ideals of Cities: Skylines, planner Colossal Order has obviously demonstrated its excitement after SimCity – not only the key thought and procedures for building and keeping up a duplicated city starting from the soonest arrange, yet a phenomenal part of the look and feel as well. In like manner, on fundamentally every check, Skylines considers insistently to the past driving figure of the city-building kind. It is, truly, the best of its kind to arrive in an entire decade – a remarkable, adaptable, staggering, and all-around marvelous reenactment that permits you to gather sprawling, single-player urban regions to your heart's substance. Building must be its own reward, regardless, in light of the way that the nonappearance of eccentric occasions or catastrophes leaves the control of running these towns feeling drained and wise. Having influence pioneer, part god-ruler with the ability to subjectively bulldoze your reenacted local people's fantasies and make schools with a tick, building a city with no arranging is for the most part standard: set down roads with the simple to-utilize contraptions, dispense zones for private, business, or mechanical structures, give utility associations, secure the cost help, then rehash the cycle with new stuff that has been opened by your making individuals hitting new points of view. Horizons finds an all things considered chipper medium between the multifaceted plan of SimCity 4 and the relative straightforwardness of SimCity 2013 by method for in this way adding zoneable zones to paths as they're laid, yet meanwhile getting a handle on mandatory busywork like laying water channels. Those stray pieces are all attempted and genuine - you couldn't have a city-design without them - so it's required that they be done well. Urban districts: Skylines does that. The crucial way this sim pounds it out of the excitement center is in its scale. Every preoccupation starts as misleadingly little, contracting you to a four-square-kilometer zone (a misty size from a SimCity design, by fortunes I'm certain), yet rapidly permits you to purchase access to a near to plot of place where there is vague size. By then it does this seven more times, for an aggregate conceivable space of 36 square kilometers. Suffice it to say, there's an extensive measure of room. Recalling that you can't especially modify space while you play, there's an included guide supervisor where you can make any land mass you pick before you skip in - or download one from the unmistakably combined Steam Workshop mod support. With such wide urban zones, it's extraordinary that Skylines licenses you to depict and organize runs exclusively. Basically paint a lump of your city with the District instrument, and you can not just name it so you can spot it effectively on the guide, however give it novel procedures that control everything from advising smoke locators to lessening fire dangers (at a cost) to supporting recreational prescription use for lower wrongdoing rates, or banning highrise structures to make depicted downtown and common zones. In mechanical zones, you can sharpen the relationship to misuse a guide's normal assets in the region to mine metal, enter for oil, create on rich land, or collect trees for officer advantage. You can even make constrain motivations for a particular kind of zone inside every zone. We ought to zoom in for a minute: we can see specific people strolling around the paths, going to work or school, sharing in beguilement works out, or returning home by the thousands. They drive autos, take arranges, and even walk pooches. (You can openly name them, yet I propose naming them Waldo, in light of the way that there are various to the point that in the event that you watch that particular one again you I say you essentially win.) This is the place you appreciate the time scale persuades the chance to be ludicrous. On the slowest speed a day endures 10 seconds – three and a half on the speediest – which deduces the excursion to work could most recent a week. Regardless, the nonattendance of a day and night cycle proposes time doesn't appear, in every way, to be an excessive amount of unnatural, however rather a reflection, making it hard to serve the speed at which things are made and charge exchange streams out. Mass travel is a sketchy savage. It's missing to set down transport stops and get prepared stations; you need to plot out courses freely, or nobody will go wherever. It's unquestionably not hard to lose all capacity to peruse a compass in that, particularly as courses begin covering and it's dumbfounding to get your vehicle stop set on the privilege half of each obliged street. Nevertheless, there are a considerable measure of choices, and the endorphin surge from making a red advancement information overlay turn green makes everything upheld, despite all the burden. Close, structures are awe inspiring and point by point, direct down to little improvements like housetop fans turning. A slider in the choices menu gives us control over the measure of essentialness of-field obscure connected with inaccessible structures when zoomed in, which mirrors SimCity's drawing in diorama influence. Horizons doesn't sort out the graphical method for SimCity, nevertheless, and given the goliath numbers we see them in they don't correctly have the assortment foreseen that would keep most neighborhoods from emitting an impression of being vague. More than anything, Cities: Skylines is about the crucial satisfaction in building. It's a truly magnificent and as regularly as would be prudent staggering reenactment, where a bewildering number of virtual individuals continue ahead over a huge swath of land. Getting in and making something is direct, however acing it will require wide research on social event wikis to comprehend why progression is vexed regardless of when you address your subjects' prominent concerns. Try not to expect strengthening conditions or sporadic occasions, yet do plan to be awed by the scale and different moving parts of this city-build.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

												Dear Paradox/Colossal Order,Today marks the 6th time in two years you have arbitrarily ruined all my savegames without warning, and I'm never buying another one of your games. Every update you do this, every update forum threads complaining about it are everywhere, every update you make excuses and do damage control to cover up the fact that you do not care about us, your customers. You're perfectly happy to continue milking this game dry with irrelevent patches and pay DLC that many of us do not even want to touch in any way whatsoever. I've rebuilt my mod set 5 times now simply because you wanted to update the game without warning and give me no option not to update... and I'm never dealing with this nonsense again. Never. The fact that Paradox hasn't stepped in and forced you to use the Betas tab (like they and any other sane developer supporting mods does) tells me they deserve just as much blame as you. This situation has never been acceptable and it's an insult that it still goes on today.I regret buying Cities Skylines a bunch of times for friends, and even supporting you this far. If I could get a refund for all the wasted time and frustration I've had simply trying to enjoy the game I paid for, I would in an instant. I always wanted to love Cities Skylines, but you refused to let me. For that, I hate you.Signed,an ex-fan			"

But they just came out with a after dark DLC which adds content that should already have been in the game and 14 bucks seems a little steep for it and if your like me with 40 pages worth of mods, your gonna probably have to remove all the mods to get the DLC to work some of which seem i cant play without that no longer work.All in all still an amazing game with a great community and great devs!

												I would recommend this game as a big improvement on SimCity. It's sold at a reasonable price, it has huge scope, & the modding community is awesome adding an enormous amount of content for free.I do have a few gripes however...Traffic becomes a real pain as your city grows. It becomes a major frustration trying to solve your cities traffic woes. Adding other means of travel has little effect as roads to & from your airports, harbours, & train stations often just moves the issue from 1 place to another. Trains themselves become a real headache as there's only 2 entrance & exit tracks on the map. The problem is that your cargo & commuter trains share the same track. You can split them once they enter your city, but they enter & leave your city on the same track. This causes them to back up which has a knock-on effect on the cargo & people aboard. Things are fine at low density, but as soon as you add high-rise high desity the traffic just really starts to go pair shaped.Another issue I found was the death rate. I don't know whether ibola is hitting my city, but whole blocks die off in a matter of in-game seconds. I live in a town, & in the 12 years I've lived there only 1 person has ever died. I keep pollution right down & clincs & hospitals abundant. It must be a balancing issue.All in all it can be a fun game, but as the city grows the game begins to irritate me. Now I just play it every so often & usually start from scratch. I would recommend at a discounted price...			"

												Below the line is my old review. It's been over a year since then so I will be adding further detail.Cities: Skylines is a phenomenal game. The reason for this is simple, Mods. The mods for this game make it infinitly better than what Collsal Order has provided. Even then, CO has provided a solid platform to create whatever you want. I am now approaching 1000 mods installed in my game and the game takes 5+ mins to load a save. My FPS runs smoothly at 15 fps and 500,000 people in my city. The performace may not be perfect but I love the game too much to let that hinder my experience. When you first get the game, play it for a couple hours, figure out how everything works. Following that, go to the workshop and download whatever you think needs to be changed/enhanced in the game. There are so many options out there for you to download.PROS:- MODS- Map Size- Extensive road management especially with mods- Extensive traffic control with especially with mods.- Large community- Customizable Difficulty with Mods- Many free updates and not required paid DLC- Devs that communicateCONS:- (FIXED WITH MODS) Lack of bridge styles- (FIXED WITH MODS) Lack of building styles- (FIXED WITH MODS) Awkward park system; only way to make custom parks is via the asset editor- Money made almost always is greater than money used- No multiplayer- Poor performance with larger cities and more modsI would have to give the game a 10 now. The mods fix almost everything and what is not fixed is excusable.10/10 - June 23, 2016______________________________________________________________Tl;dr: I've played over 30 hours since it came out (5 days ago)So. I like my city builders. And although Simcity 2013 had its flaws, it had many good things. For example, city specialization are good and graphics are really nice (except for the intersections.) All in all, Simcity 2013 is a great game with two major downfalls, traffic and map size.On to Cities: Skylines. Traffic has been vastly improved on and map size is literally 9x that of Simcity; 25x with mods. Rather than paragraph form the good ♥♥♥♥ and bad ♥♥♥♥, here is a fancy list.PROS:- Map Size- Road System- Many building sizes- Better zoning system than Simcity.- Transit control- Difficulty. Getting a perfectly balanced city without issues is near impossible so lots of content.- As mentioned, lots of replay value.- Large community- Steam WorkshopCONS:- Lack of bridge styles- Lack of building styles- Awkward park system; only way to make custom parks is via the asset editor (I think that's what it is called.)- Money made almost always is greater than money used. - No multiplayer (as of writing this. Maybe they'll add it?)Overall, 9.8/10 - March 2015As what everyone else has said, it's the game Simcity 2013 should've been and more. Had a great community and a great developer. Also, its on steam.			"

												The citybuilder I have been waiting for for what feels like forever. It's pretty hard not to make a comparison to EA/Maxis's SimCity 2013 here, because that is what this game looks like, but it feels so much better. The simulation is really solid. Traffic is awesome and your city can contain up to a million individuals that have an actual life-cycle. Features a really simple building and zoning system with excellent tools to make it how you want. Maps are huge and has water with real dynamics.All this, on the Unity Engine, which is pretty amazing! Oh, and it comes with full modding support (w/Steam Workshop integration)!Now, It's not perfect and could use some improvments in some areas (see below), but I'm sure Colossal Order will provide us with plenty of updates and expansions in the coming future. This game is well worth the ~20EUR. There are hours and hours of fun here!What I did not like (this might change):- Bulldozer tool does not support destroying large areas, only one object at a time- Laying down water-pipes is kind of boring (Maybe I just got spoiled by SC2013 here)- Placing buildings on curved roads can be kind of hard in some cases- Placing down large intersections from assets kan be hard if the terrain is not perfectly straight- Placing roads straight relative to the border is really hard because the road does not snap (SC2013 had the Shift key for this)- The ""Tutorial"" you get when start the game is not that good- The ""Tutorial"" popus can get annoying- Music does not seem to be normalized, becoming way to loud in some sectionsWhat I liked:- Everything else			"

												It's perhaps easy to see how Cities: Skylines has done so well, considering the failure SimCity 2013 was.I've played SimCity 2013 and Cities XL (not their latest iteration), but so far I consider Skylines to be a far better City Builder.SimCity got a hard rap for the online-only requirement, followed by a week of connectivity issues post-launch. The shame of this was that it detracted from an actually rather good simulator mixing challenges with creativity.Skylines has no multiplayer element, so likewise there are no weird online-only requirements. There are a bunch of available regions to start off in, each with differing amounts of available land and resources. When you start your game, you'll be presented with a highway connection and a basic guide to get you started, similar to other city builders. The game unlocks more tools as your population increases, making sure that you don't overbuild when your city is young. For the most part, all of these features are identical to other city builders.Where Skylines differs are the range of public transport available, and how they work. You can set up individual train lines, metro lines, and bus lines. This isn't a surprise, given that the game comes from the same team that developed Cities in Motion.One of the most interesting features I've experienced in the game so far is their water flow modelling. You start off having to place water pumps and sewage outflows into your nearest water source. However for rivers this means that you need to build your pump upstream of your sewage to avoid poisoning your population.Where it gets even more interesting is when you build hydroelectric dams. These dams will have a variable rate of power production based on the strength of the river it's blocking. Building a dam also has an interesting side effect; it causes the water level upstream of the dam to rise, which makes it really easy to flood your city if you're not careful. It's not something I've experienced in a game before. Oh, the game also lets you decide what side of the road your people drive on, which is a first as far as I know.This leads me on to some of my frustrations with this game. There's currently no option for terraforming an active city (as far as I can tell), which means that making flood-preventing earthworks is currently impossible. Likewise, thngs like road tunnels are completely missing from the game as well, although the developers have said these will be planned as part of a free update. It'd also be nice to have some better info overlays around road usage, as by far the biggest challenge in this game, like many other city sims, is dealing with traffic flow around the city. As an aside, it would be nice for one of these games someday to allow us to try out different junction types.However, by far the stand-out boon for this game is it's excellent Workshop support, which has already seen thousands of submissions in the short time the game has been avaiable, including contributions from the occasional former Maxis employee. I spent yesterday being captivated by a selection of highway interchanges by some dude in Germany (I think),  that's no joke. I could easily spend more time in the Workshop than the game itself, there's so much to see.The game was made by Colossal Order, but it's under the stewardship of Paradox Games. Given the game's success so far, it seems like this game will more than likely recieve plenty of support for years to come, with expansions and DLC being provided in a CK2 style, along with free updates and the like.SummaryPros:+ Familiar city builder style, mixed with some novel public transport and water features+ No crazy online-only requirements+ Excellent Workshop support+ Its current success ensures it'll be well supported for some time+ Cheaper than Cities XXL now, cheaper than SimCity when SC was releasedCons:- No obvious ability to terraform, making flood defences impossible- No ability to create tunnels limits road options or the ability to create tunnels under water bodies- Not as many features or items as other city builders, which might reduce effective play time.Verdict:Honestly, at this price I have to recommend this game to anyone who enjoys city builders. It may not have quite the same number of features as other games, but the mod support means there's more than enough stuff you can add to the game until the first round of content updates start coming to keep you going.

												It's perhaps easy to see how Cities: Skylines has done so well, considering the failure SimCity 2013 was.I've played SimCity 2013 and Cities XL (not their latest iteration), but so far I consider Skylines to be a far better City Builder.SimCity got a hard rap for the online-only requirement, followed by a week of connectivity issues post-launch. The shame of this was that it detracted from an actually rather good simulator mixing challenges with creativity.Skylines has no multiplayer element, so likewise there are no weird online-only requirements. There are a bunch of available regions to start off in, each with differing amounts of available land and resources. When you start your game, you'll be presented with a highway connection and a basic guide to get you started, similar to other city builders. The game unlocks more tools as your population increases, making sure that you don't overbuild when your city is young. For the most part, all of these features are identical to other city builders.Where Skylines differs are the range of public transport available, and how they work. You can set up individual train lines, metro lines, and bus lines. This isn't a surprise, given that the game comes from the same team that developed Cities in Motion.One of the most interesting features I've experienced in the game so far is their water flow modelling. You start off having to place water pumps and sewage outflows into your nearest water source. However for rivers this means that you need to build your pump upstream of your sewage to avoid poisoning your population.Where it gets even more interesting is when you build hydroelectric dams. These dams will have a variable rate of power production based on the strength of the river it's blocking. Building a dam also has an interesting side effect; it causes the water level upstream of the dam to rise, which makes it really easy to flood your city if you're not careful. It's not something I've experienced in a game before. Oh, the game also lets you decide what side of the road your people drive on, which is a first as far as I know.This leads me on to some of my frustrations with this game. There's currently no option for terraforming an active city (as far as I can tell), which means that making flood-preventing earthworks is currently impossible. Likewise, thngs like road tunnels are completely missing from the game as well, although the developers have said these will be planned as part of a free update. It'd also be nice to have some better info overlays around road usage, as by far the biggest challenge in this game, like many other city sims, is dealing with traffic flow around the city. As an aside, it would be nice for one of these games someday to allow us to try out different junction types.However, by far the stand-out boon for this game is it's excellent Workshop support, which has already seen thousands of submissions in the short time the game has been avaiable, including contributions from the occasional former Maxis employee. I spent yesterday being captivated by a selection of highway interchanges by some dude in Germany (I think),  that's no joke. I could easily spend more time in the Workshop than the game itself, there's so much to see.The game was made by Colossal Order, but it's under the stewardship of Paradox Games. Given the game's success so far, it seems like this game will more than likely recieve plenty of support for years to come, with expansions and DLC being provided in a CK2 style, along with free updates and the like.SummaryPros:+ Familiar city builder style, mixed with some novel public transport and water features+ No crazy online-only requirements+ Excellent Workshop support+ Its current success ensures it'll be well supported for some time+ Cheaper than Cities XXL now, cheaper than SimCity when SC was releasedCons:- No obvious ability to terraform, making flood defences impossible- No ability to create tunnels limits road options or the ability to create tunnels under water bodies- Not as many features or items as other city builders, which might reduce effective play time.Verdict:Honestly, at this price I have to recommend this game to anyone who enjoys city builders. It may not have quite the same number of features as other games, but the mod support means there's more than enough stuff you can add to the game until the first round of content updates start coming to keep you going.

												The defining experience of the city-building game, the level of detail in Skylines. Every last citizen (or ""Cim,"" in a nod to the Cities series' inspiration) is modeled; every last car or truck on the road carries a Cim or else cargo for a defined destination. Busses pull up, and individual Cims board and depart. They drive, take the train, or even walk to their destination. It is this level of detail that truly defines the transit side of the game: if one of your roads is clogged with congestion, there are very specific reasons why, and your options for dealing with it are vast. Add more roads? If so, which type? Would a bus line help? Probably not if it's all truck traffic; maybe a cargo train station? Hell, if it's all one factory that's causing the congestion, which can be checked by clicking on the individual trucks as they come and go, maybe you could even destroy the factory. But outside of the transit side of things, the game is just ridiculously easy. As a veteran of SimCity 1 through 4, the defining challenge of that game -- the fact that you're always broke -- is gone here. My second city was generating such insane amounts of cash by the time it hit 10k citizens that money stopped being a factor altogether, letting me do completely insane things like putting entire interstate highway systems underground or putting subway stops in every insignificant little suburban area. Things like crime and health require very little attention to manage. Your town's buildings are apparently made of gasoline-soaked cardboard and are constantly catching fire, so you need something like 5 fire stations for every police station, but again it's not a big deal since money is a non-issue. Your city's expansion is limited by your ability to do all that tedious R/C/I zoning.Well, that and your ability to manage your city's transit. It's like all the rest of the game is just an excuse to frame the devs' real interest: creating an intricate transit simulation, with every last train, plane, ship, bus, truck, car and scooter simulated individually. So while the series pretends to be the offshoot of SimCity, it's actually the offshoot of Cities in Motion.But whatever the shortcomings are, it's certainly better and far more fun than the dumpster fire known as the latest SimCity. Actually, I bet dumpster fires could be kind of fun IRL, but never mind. Qualified thums-up: grab it when next on sale.			"

												This game is Simcity 2013 done RIGHT as well as considered a true successor of Simcity 4. Yes, its developer is different but they really got this game done right for a city builder. Huge amount of space to build on and if you run out, expand and buy more land. Full modding support so you'll expect some pretty cool stuff to download. The game still has some flaws such as no day/night cycle as of the time of this quick review, but the pros still outweight the cons found in this game.  If you enjoyed Simcity 4 or any city builder/simulator, get it. I was surprised this game is worth $30 USD. It's so well worth that price tag.			"

												This is a great game! It is great fun to build a city and it is quite relaxing. The modding comunity is great because there are many great mods such as the first person camera mod. The only problem I have had is that not all mods come up in the cotent manager but I was able to resolve it by going into the files of the game. It is slightly annoying but it is still definatley worth it. Also, I shouldn't be able to run this game but I can still run it fine whilst the graphics still looks great. I have a 2.5 ghz processor and intel HD 4600 graphics with 112mb graphics. I can't garantee it will run if you have similar performance specs but it did for me! Anyway I would definatley recomend this to anyone who likes building or managing anything.If you aren't sure if you'd like to get this game I would recomend getting the Simcity 5 demo on origin and try that out. If you like that in the slightest you should like this game even more since cities skylines in my opinion is better that Simcity 5!I thinks it's better than simcity 5 because, this has bigger plots, more of the people are actually simulated in game plus I like the modding comunity for Cities: Skylines!

												Finally, a good city builder after all these years! Cities: Skylines seems to handle very well everything the other recent city builders couldn't.  For starters - it works. I'll admit the game did crash once for me, but it seems to have been an isolated incident. After playing 26 hours, this one crash is the only negative I can come up with. The game seems to squeeze all the juice out of my system in terms of CPU and GPU usage (Intel i7 Quad Core 2.67Ghz, 16GB RAM, Geforce GTX465), but in return it gives me a smooth and enjoyable playing experience! Unlike the competition, you can build large cities, but there are no slowdowns, no stuttering and no need to restart the game every 30 minutes. As of now, to my knowledge, Cities: Skylines is the only good city building game available. The other two I'm aware of (Simcity, Cities XXL) don't even come close, as they have too many problems.

												It's more of a road network building simulator than a city simulator. All of the zones you zone and all of the buildings you build are there to drive traffic in & out of your city. 90% of your planning and building and organizing goes towards the road network, to the point of micromanaging and obsessing. 90% of the problems you will face when laying out your city will be road related. Building the city just involves dragging zones with a paint tool and plonking down service buildings like hospitals and schools. All the cities end up looking and feeling very, very similar. The cities are very easy to build and grow. The only real challenge you ever face is designing a road network that flows and is not chaotic. This is fine. This can be fun. This can be interesting, and challenging. But this does not qualify as a city simulator.			"

												I've been itching for a game like this since I almost made it to the year 3000 in SimCity 3000. Not that I didn't play a good bit of 4, but it's hard for me to jump into older games like that.Skylines just feels right. It's like that feeling I got when I played the SimCity 5 demo but the good feelings just keep rolling. I'm a bit of a stickler when it comes to data and they don't skimp. I'm so glad SOMEONE had the werewithall and knowledge to put forth a proper, next-gen city builder. Parks and Rec can only satiate me so much. I need a simulation, dammit!They do simulation so well, it's practically a stimulation simulation.			"

												Even with the difficulty and complexity, everything about Cities: Skylines seems designed to welcome and relax you. Though player input is frequent and mistakes can be punishing, you're always learning, and working to build a better city for all. With the inclusion of the Steam Workshop, this feels as though it were a true successor to the giant that SimCity 4 was. Simply put, this is the best city-builder on the market today, and quite possibly one of the best of all time.Read the full review at: http://pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/cities-skylines/ "

												Cities: Skylines is an amazing city builder game. Its a simple concept but such an amazing game! The graphics are very good and the game itself is amazing, it's such a well executed game! It costs a lot but in some sales it goes down to arond£9.00, you can get it cheaper online though. Its very good as it doesn't force you to do anything, on your first city it gives you tips but in general they just leave you alone to play! Its quite realistic and has lots of ideas which you can relate to in the place you live. The new snowfall expansion is sounding very promising, released on 18 february! The after dark expansion is great, it doesn't add much for the price but adds a new element by adding the prison and taxi service. btw the after dark expansion doesn't add the day and night cycle, its already on the game. (it advertises this on its page!) I especially like trying to control the traffic as it is difficult to keep it flowing; if your traffic flows your city flows! Overall i really like this game and would recommend it to anyone who likes city builder games!I'd rate this game 89/100			"

My simplified game review after my first major capitol city.  I want to keep it simple because of the lack of hours however, here I go for the new players =D Pros: 101.  Very nice balance you have to integrate in your cities' design between the  residential (low/high density) vs commercial (low/high density) vs industrial.2.  Day and Night cycle affects the functions of cities which is new for me. Ex The sound pollution at night in a leisure district affects low density residents.  There are many more examples.3.  This game doesn't spell anything out for you besides using the basic functions of zoning, road connecting, traffic etc.  You have to experiment for yourself to see how policies, roads, crime, or new building work together.  If you are a cookie cutter gamer, you might not like this pro.4.  The economy is how you control your city. Its the lifeline.  IF you have no money all you can do is raze structures, rezone, tax higher, redistrict.  No more city buildings to aid your zones.5.  Land values increase your taxes, if you design your city well to meet individual needs, equity goes up.  6.  Graphics are fantastic. It makes it easy to get lost in your creation. 7.  Rename businesses, districts, citizens, buildings.8.  Workshop content keeps the game fresh once you break that last few achievements.9.  You can create your own maps to build your own cities in if you dont care for default variants.10.  Set paths for buses and metros to combat the terrors of the common enemy in cities: rush hour.  Cons: 4 1.  The Zoned buildings will be repetitive.2.  Puting in water pipes can feel like busy work.3.  No natural disaster to spice up the game once you are satisified with your creation(possibly a future mod or expansion I hope). 4.  Traffic lights = Inefficient. No other way of putting it.  Combination of timing with lights and the AI pathing the vehicles.Conclusion:  If you are into building cities, Get this game.  Its relaxing, interesting, and stunning.  Be creative and be the next Robert Moses (New York), Hippodamus of Miletus (Ancient Greece), or Georges-Eugène Haussmann (Paris) of the modern world.			"

												A Simcity clone that surpassed the original. Well at least the Simcity 2013 version. Everything Simcity did wrong in the last iteration this game fixes and improves upon. Larger maps, better transport systems, ability to create districts with different policies and a game that supports modding from day one.If there's anything wrong i have to say about it it's that the game lacks enough buildings variety and the modular design of the buildings from the newer Simcity its the only thing that game did right and would have been good here as well. That's more of a minor complaint since modding or future dlc will no doubt improve that.My impression of it is very good so far and to be honest even a decent city builder these days is enough if you want to play one since there's not much competition out there for it.

The citizens will ask for it when they need something without being too demanding.The simulation is very accurate.

												Fun game! It is what Sim City V could have been. It is balanced by making you look after the city, not just leave the game open and pile up money. Traffic is a difficult part, but that simply adds in character to the game. Definitelly love the fact you can create your own structures as well :) very nice feature! However, tree placement could be better, maybe give people a brush which they can use to paint trees and such, rather than placing one by one. Other than that I would gladly give it 10/10Best city simulator I ever played. I do recommend buying it! It is worth every penny.			"

												This is one of the most addictive games I have played in a long long time. First of all, this is my first game I've played of this genre. The closest I've played is Banished (which I love), but this has a great deal more depth in managing your city. I did watch 6-8 hours of ""how to"" videos on youtube before I played for real. And I highly recommend that to anyone new to the genre. What you'll find when you do play and figure it out a bit is that it is highly addicitve as there is always just ""one more thing"" to do before you can quit. The intricacy of how everything has to be balanced is a sweet feature. For instance, my current town has about 54,000 citizens but I leveled off at about 40,000 for a while and couldn't figure out why. As it turns out (hello Google!), I had over-educated my population so nobody would take my factory/ industrial jobs. So my unemployment rate was a bit high and nobody wanted to move to town! So, I shut down 2-3 elementary schools, 2 high schools and a university. Presto....the average education level of my citizenry took a small dip and the town started growing again! THAT is some sweet relational effects. There are things you can do to make use of a highly educated workforce, but then you better have exceptional outside contacts (road, rail and ships!) to bring in goods to feed/drive your economy. It is fascinating. Now excuse me while I get back to Wertydurd and crack 60,000 residents so I can build a dang airport. 12/10			"

Cities: Skylines is a amazing game, the devs listening to us (unlike Maxis) and have a amazing talent. There are somethings that needs to be improved, but I'm confident that this game will grow up even more with time and with the community feedback			"

												A Simcity clone that surpassed the original. Well at least the Simcity 2013 version. Everything Simcity did wrong in the last iteration this game fixes and improves upon. Larger maps, better transport systems, ability to create districts with different policies and a game that supports modding from day one.If there's anything wrong i have to say about it it's that the game lacks enough buildings variety and the modular design of the buildings from the newer Simcity its the only thing that game did right and would have been good here as well. That's more of a minor complaint since modding or future dlc will no doubt improve that.My impression of it is very good so far and to be honest even a decent city builder these days is enough if you want to play one since there's not much competition out there for it.

While it was sad to see the end of Maxis, I can't help but feel Cities: Skylines is a great start to what a franchise that could very well take ownership of the premier city building franchise.

												This is the city simulator I have been waiting for since Simcity 4, and it has delivered. There are too many good things to say about this game, so I will focus on the -very few- negatives that I've encountered.  I think it it is too forgiving on traffic issues, it could use more building variety, and I think it could use an ""in-game"" terraforming option.I have high hopes for this game being the best city sim ever, especially with day one modding support, and future patches and DLC.

												Really love this game. It's what Sim City 2013 should have been. Plenty of teething problems that need patching though. Poor multi-lane traffic behaviour for one. Vehicles tend not to pass eachother and clump up when merging regardless of the number of lanes. Highway ramps are waay too good. They are one direction, single lane but vehicles go full highway speed on them, regardless of what you're joining to, making them a panacea for traffic troubles. Jam at a junction? throw down some ramps! kinda fun though.Sweet water physics in this game but don't bother building a hydro dam. The resevoir becomes static and you get no energy out after a while, at which point you may as well mercilessly delete it and wipe out your newly zoned industrial district because what the hell you made a save point just before. Also the flood plains don't become any more fertile, and space is plentiful in this game, so what's the point? Huge tankers can (as is a rule in city-sims) turn on a dime at 180 degrees a second in shallow waters, but harbors still need to be placed in direct line of sight to sea... what? Why can't they navigate a simple estuary? Helmsman is wasted potential.I had a major problem with garbage. You can't simply remove dumps without emptying them first. When you empty, say to an incinerator, ALL the dumps trucks are used to empty it, and still takes forever, making the city suffer... if you don't notice thats whats happening. Also dead people (if they die in residences) are not dealt with by ambulences. You need hearses to come pick them up. Not only that, but like dumps, cemetaries become full, so with a click of a button the church is digging up the bodies, throwing them back in the hearse and driving them to the crematorium. ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant.Districts and policies are a great feature. Combined with the sheer map sizes, they make it feel like a real city. You can have a high density downtown with a rent thats too damn high, an industrial district with reduced safety laws, more accidents and huge profits, some farms, a woodland reserve, a Beverly Hills with ridiculous taxes and high land value, all while forgetting about Jim who lives next to the dump and is dying from air, water and noise polution (yes, noise does hospitalise people in this game. ♥♥♥♥ing genius.)Despite all the extra challenges, its still very easy to make a huge income. Partially because a lot of the expensive services pay toward themselves, you have loads of space to work with (See achievement ""SIMulated City: Have an area the size of nine map tiles"" - shots fired) but mainly because freight harbors are OP as ♥♥♥♥. Shame there isn't too much of an end-game as Sim City, as that had Godzilla, zombie outbreaks and Great Works... Definitely missing out on these features. I mean come on, you need cemetaries to hold the dead... it logically follows that when it maxes capacity there should be zombie incidents. Someone make this happen with mods, please?TL;DR: Solves the problems of Sim City, creates a couple of its own. Buy this if you like reading awfully hash-tagged tweets from your citizens. #familyvalues #economicboom #iamso♥♥♥♥ingbasic #education #gogreen #noticememayor-senpai.			"

												A fantastic citybuilder, my favourite since SimCity 4.Since the most likely points of comparison here are SimCity 2015 and Cities XL, I'll break it down into quick points:Compared to SimCity 2015:-Game's fully offline. The only online aspect is the integration with Steam Workshop.-Deep modding. Game include's both a map editor and an asset editor. Workshop is already bursting at the seams with stuff.-Giantic room for constructing cities. You start with a single 2x2 km square, and you can eventually purchase 8 more squares. There's already mods allowing to purchase all 25 squares a map has (that's 100 sq km).-Cims (Skylines' version of Sims) are fully simulated and actually make sense.-Traffic simulation is incredibly deep (though there's still some issues with cars accumulating in a single lane sometimes).-No building upgrade.-Specialization is not as deep as in SimCity, but the District system allows you to essentially create individual cities within the same map, with their own laws, taxes, and industrial focuses.-Several info overlays are almost copied from SimCity, even in their presentation.-Skylines is less colourful than SimCity, but also a bit more realistic.-Music isn't bad in Skylines, but SimCity's better.Compared to Cities XL-Map are just a little bit smaller (Cities XL has 110 sq km, Skylines has 100 sq km with mods, 36 sq km without).-Zoning is much, more comfortable, particularly with curved roads.-No lag (although large cities can be taxing depending on your computer). Brisk road building even for huge tracks.-Graphics are somewhat similar.-Interface is far more user-friendly.-Traffic simulation is orders of magnitude more interesting.-Road variety is more or less the same (just in terms of types. Skylines' free-form roadbuilding allows for pretty much unlimited road-building methods).-So far, I've encountered not a single memory leak or similarly wrecking bug.Overall, the game is great. It is true it is in some aspects less deep than SimCity 4 and it does have some usability nuances (such as zoning not always looking exactly the way you want, though this is the price we pay for free-form orientation, I suppose), but it does so much stuff so great that you quickly let that pass. Traffic itself is so well done that it becomes a game unto itself (which is no wonder, considering the game was developed by the same people behind Cities in Motion).Modding support is also excellent. Though the base game comes with a somewhat limited variety of buildings, ten minutes in the Workshop will land you with several dozen new structures that will seamless integrate into your cities, and new stuff is being made faster than we can check it.Some of the missing stuff, such as tunnels, is already being considered as free DLCs in the near future.10/10 game. This is both the citibuilder we wanted and the citibuilder we deserved.			"

												Everything a city builder should be. Is it perfect? No. A city builder simulation will never be perfect. However, this is close to perfection. Knowing we will get flooded with new content, patches, mods and whatnot, this is Christmas for gamers addicted to city builders and simulation games. It was easy to learn, fun to plan, not as easy as it looks, you always want more, it's a toxic sleep killer. Finally we have a real successor to 2003's SimCity4 with a lot of similarities. As if SC4 was now Cities Skylines (the policies, the districts, the neighbor plots, etc). Oh and I'm able to play on my 2 year old laptop, without a hickup, it played well instantly. This is a winner and the game will be even better down the road. Don't even hesitate to buy this game.			"

												Just a short review here: Cities Skylines is a really nice game. It clearly takes its inspiration from both classic Sim City and the recent Sim City 2013, however, it ends up being something really quite special. The simulation is really robust. I've yet to find any major problems and/or bugs. My cities have had issues but they've all been the result of my poor planning, and with a little thought and re-working I have managed to fix them and learn from my mistakes in a way that is very satisfying. The depth of simulation vs. abstraction is also great. Some things, such as wind-drection and night/day cycles are missing but they don't have any noticable impact on the gameplay once you are involved.I think that the lack of need for a tutorial speaks volumes too. The game just makes sense. You can bring your real-life knowledge of how towns and cities are set up here along with a healthy dose of common sense and you will succeed. The result is the feeling that you really are creating and overseeing a living community rather than simply gaming a system which is fantastic.Over all, I really recommend this game to anyone that has even a passing interest in city building games. Its by far the best option on the market now, and its going to take something pretty special to beat it any time soon. "

												If you're a fan of cities simulator, you've just found the perfect game for you, buddy. Congratulations.This game managed to overcome Sim City 2000 and Sim City 4 combined, two of my favourite city manager simulators ever. In Cities: Skylines you'll start building your city from just an intersection coming out of a highway in the middle of nowhere, manage your budget, expand, make some decisions (not enough cash, do I build a fire station or a hospital?), expand even more, watch as your small poor village in the middle of nowhere becomes a gigantic metropolis that people from all around the world come to visit.All in all, Cities: Skylines managed to be everything SimCity's reboot failed to be. The only con I have with this game is that it somehow lacks introduction, there are small tips here and there, but the complicated parts you have to discover pretty much by yourself (or search for tutorials on Youtube, lol).Now excuse me while I lose some more hours of sleep expanding my city. ):			"

												Yeah this is a great game. It does everything Sim City did right, and more. Graphics are killer nice, and it runs well on medium-end systems too. Steam Workshop pushes it to a whole 'nother level too. I really hope they have expansion packs in the distant future. Pros1. Great graphics2. Really fun to play3. Great user interface (very intuitive)4. The core game engine seems really solid in how every person has logic and can be named/followed/etc.Cons1. 30$ was expensive, but still worth it2. No night-time mode3. No multiplayer, which may have made it the end-all city builderThis is an easy decision if you like city builders, IMO. Well worth the money. Also check out Banishsed.			"

												If you're one of those people whom, like me, was let down by the release of SimCity 2013, this game is for you.If you're one of those people whom was pleased with SimCity 2013, this game is for you.If you enjoy city builders, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.Let's begin.First, why is this game for those of us let down by simcity 2013? This game harnesses what made the older simcity games great and adds on to it the way I expect a sequel should have added on to the previous major installment, SimCity 4. There is no online DRM whatsoever, the map sizes are initially restricted to a 2x2 km square like SC 2013 but can be expanded up to 6x6 in any arrangement, or modded to 10x10 km (25 plots of 2x2 land). That's a lot. That even matches up with the ""huge"" cities XL franchise, and I feel like it may even surpass it at times as ALL maps are capable of reaching this size.This game brings back features that some may like, some may not - power lines, water pipes, some of the busywork we found ourselves doing in older simcity games. Despite having no in-game terraforming, the game does have a map editor that uses easy-to-use terraforming-style tools you would use in simcity games, as well as supporting heightmap importing and exporting allowing you to easily create real world locations to build in, or make your own and export them to the steam workshop for others to enjoy. An asset editor, much like the old urban renewal kits, allows you to modify buildings or add new ones, as well as upload them to the steam workshop again or download ones others have made.As far as straight up gameplay features, you will be happy to see the return of mass transit on a large scale that SimCity 2013 removed most of. You'll have trains, boats, planes, buses, subways, and highways to manage, as well as being able to create lines for each that add to the realism and also control of the game rather than plopping stops and letting the mass transit roam free. You'll also find that while there is no regional play, you instead have cities within cities - districts, you can say. Each can have their own ordinances/policies, their own tax rates, and be specialized differently than other districts or the rest of the city. Zones find the addition of a new type of zone, Offices, which act as a form of clean industrial zone. You'll also find yourself now dealing with the dead, and having cemeteries and crematoriums to send them to.Why is this game for those of you that LIKED simcity 2013?  (repeats a bit)First of all, the graphics in SimCity 2013 were without doubt the greatest a city builder has ever seen. This game matches, and in some ways, surpasses what SimCity 2013 was capable of in the graphical department. You keep the tilt-shift effect which appears to have been improved, and texture work is beyond amazing.Now, you won't be finding any multiplayer or regional play in this game. However, what you WILL find is mods. A lot of mods. Hundreds of mods, maps, and addons on the steam workshop already at the time of this review. They're easy to obtain, and you can turn them on or off within the game itself. You'll also notice map sizes are far bigger, which means you have so much room you can effectivelly still do your regional play - cities the size of that in SimCity 2013 were 2x2 km in size, and this game allows you to get 9 such plots by default, 25 plots with a mod. That's 25 spaces that could be used however you want, all linked to one another not by a preset highway, but by you and how you want them to be connected. It's also likely that anyone who's played SimCity 2013 has played a previous simcity, and you will find every feature of those old games - minus the regional play and neighbor deals as a direct result - in here. You will also still find city specialization in a different style than that of SC2013. Rather than placing individual buildings, you will instead create districts (cities within cities, each having their own taxes and ordinances/policies) and specialize them to agriculture, oil drilling, ore mining, or forestry. The industrial zones you place within these districts will then switch to utilize your chosen specialization, replacing their buildings with ones suited for what you want. This allows you to create far bigger specialized areas, and far quicker and with more ease. In the event you require resources that would otherwise be extracted from these specializations, such as to run coal or oil power plants, they will be automatically imported through trains, boats, planes, or simple road at no extra cost to you - just keep the traffic flowing so the delivery trucks can reach their destination.If this sounds easy, it's not. This game can bite you alive several hours in. You will find it far more challenging than simcity 2013 or cities XL ever has been, and that's without activating the built-in hard mode mod. At first, it will be easy - that's due to you building in a small area of land with limited building availability. It's when everything is unlocked and you're sitting there with 100,000 fully simulated citizens running around their daily lives that all hell crumbles down on you.Do you enjoy city builders? You play tropico, or cities XL, etc? Play this.I'm going to skip the basic stuff and say it straight forward. Anything you can do in Cities XL or Tropico (in regards to city building, I'm aware tropico has dictator stuff going on that you won't find here), you are more than capable of doing here in a much easier way. You have more control over customization, more control over the city, and all taking place in a game that looks better and has one of the best developers and publishers out there at your back for support with the steam workshop throwing hundreds at the time of this review, THOUSANDS in the near future, of mods, maps, and addons in your direction to play with as well as letting you make your OWN with ease. That is all.I grew up playing SimCity, and soon found myself playing other city builders in the form of Tropico and City Life. Cities XL was a game I tried to like and just couldn't due to how unplayable it was, and tropico is re-releasing a similar game every year with little effort to innovate anymore like PopTop used to back in the day. SimCity 2013 looked promising in trailers, but upon its' release I tried my hardest to like it with 130 hours of game time but I could not make myself like it. It was simply too small scale and too easy, and I just missed everything you could do with the older simcity games. Modding was so easy for SimCity 4, and the cities were so much more fun to make, that upon going back I wondered why I had ever tried to like SimCity 2013 in the first place. I even dug up my old SimCity 2000 and 3000 discs and got those running, and since I'm not old enough to have experienced SimCity for the SNES when it initially came out, even got myself a cartridge for that off of amazon and gave it a whirl. Each gave me hours and hours of enjoyment that 2013's verison never could. Cities Skylines I was rather worried about actually, as I thought they would focus too much on fixing the city sizes and offline to actually add anything worthwhile or fun beyond that and this game would end up along the lines of Cities XL for production value. I have never been more wrong and I am really, REALLY pleased to say that. I owe an absolutely massive thank you to Colossal and Paradox for making this game in such a fantastic state. They have managed to bring a childhood game back for many of us in a fantastic way.This is the greatest city builder in over a decade to be released. Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive have stated that more content and updates are going to be on our way for years to come, so we can only expect it to get better from here. Also, did you notice the game is only $30? Why are you still reading this...GO AND BUY THE GAME ALREADY!Recommend: YES. YES. YES. SO MUCH YES.			"

												*Those with Performance Issues*You need to check which graphics card your computer is using when playing Cities: Skylines.  Beforehand, I could only run the game at absolute lowest settings, windowed mode, and a lowered resolution and it was still low fps, which really bummed me out.  I have my computer set to use my Nvidia graphics card (760M) on everything, but for some reason this game was set to use the intel one instead.  All you need to do is set the .exe file to use your high performance card instead. Now I can run the game at max settings flawlessly.  Excellent Game so far!			"

												It really was a fun game, but it quickely devolved in to a shallow, unchallenging experience.Once you learn the tricks on how to organize your city it becomes pretty easy. The basic core is you have to manage the demands of your city while building new infrustructure. Sounds fun, except it really comes down to 3 demands: Housing, Industry, and Commercial. If the demand for housing goes up? Build a road and zone it for houses. How about Industry and Commercial? Do the same thing.Sure, there are other things like resource management where you actually have to have the power, water/sewage, and other civil services. But a few hours in to my game I guess I found a sweet spot between growth and taxes because my cash flow exploded in to the millions before I even realized it happened. I could put hospitals and police on every street corner.My city had become somewhat of a paradise, and it felt too easy.			"

												In a world filled with overpriced AAA titles and wallet-destoying DLC pricing -- Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive have really outdone themselves with Cities:Skylines. Half the price of a AAA title with more polish, functionality, and fun than any city-builder released in the last twenty years. The modding community is insane, and if there's anything you want to add to the game, rest assured that there's a mod for that. Pick it up, you won't regret it!			"

 Cities:Skylines by Colossal Order A beutiful and addicting game that I probably will spend hours on end playing. If you like games like Civ 5 or Democracy 3, you will probably love this as well! So here are the pro's and cons: Good: - No EA (meaning no microtransactions. Oops, looks like you have to pay £0,99 to read on!)- Graphics- Simulation- Gameplay- Map editor- European maps- The ablility to rename EVERY single car and house, and it stays that way. You can also rename dogs, so I did. I called it dogmeat (Fallout-fans, please, contain your örgasms. I had to write örgasm for Steam to not censor it. And it sounds pretty damn funny.)-And now, contrary to popular beliefs; the Chirper (it isn't that bad if you click the ""don't open the messages automatically. It can actually help you a lot. Also, it's kinda cute).- The feeling that it's alive- Almost everything else The Meh - Hot-dog trucks - Building variation isn't too great.- Not that many monuments... The Bad - Map editor water tool. Uncontrollable and just spreads everywere. Also no undo button for this (10/10 would have to make a new map 3 times).- The #use of #haschtags in #all the #tweets. @developers, please #reduce the amount of #haschtags thank #you #yoloswag.- No special districts for office zones (marketing, software, entrepreneurship etc.)- No actual Hadron colliders.- You not having it in your Steam libraryMy score  10/10 My necessary silly review quote: I renamed a guys car to ""The Hippie Van"" and watched his house burn down, probably because I doused his kitchen in gasoline. I then threw the remains in the landfill. Then I played Cities Skylines and it was fun.  (EDIT) This game has made me realise why the world looks like it does today. I neglected worries about polution, noise and health, focused only on making the city as big as possible. When I realised I became legitimately scared. No other game has made me get such a enlightenment, it truly terrifies me. GG world.			"

												No demand to be online, no crashing on day one, an unbelievable amount of fun as well as useful mods on day one. What is not to like?The bad - No auto save (but a mod seem to be out that fixes that). Lack of direction to some extent and info details that might have made the game more fun. After a point money becomes no issue and instead of being limited by money I am limited by growth, but might just be me.The good - It is an actual city building sim that is actually good. I am having a blast seeing my city grow, seeing me expand my borders as I can afford new land. Fun with new buildings being unlocked. You can name just about anything and any one and follow em/it around. This is a great great city game.Consider me ready to throw money at any deserving expansion, sequal or DLC to support more of this goodness!			"

												Bringing in brand new elements in a brilliant way, this game isn’t just a SimCity that works, but a brand new and much better City Builder that you’ll be playing for hours. This game arrives in a strange period I’m calling the SimDrought (not a real game), with no one quite sure of how the genre is meant to progress. They took the risky move of making a game in a rough climate and pulled through making everyone realise there’s still a place in this world for City Simulation games, and they’re better than ever.Check out my full review here![www.idiotbox.co.uk] "

												Been looking forward to this games release for a while and after having the chance to play it for a while, i am -generaly- satisfied. I am happy to reccomend this game, as it goes back to the roots of proper city building we know from the early days of sim city and beyond. However! There are a few issues, which i am willing to pinn to the fact it's fresh out, though a few of those really should have been adressed prior to release.- No autosave! > Really? Game like this? With no autosave? I've already lost hours of gameplay because of game crashes.- Emergency services being ignored by other traffic reguardless of road type. > What do they have them sirens for then, if they stop at traffic lights anyway? Enough said.- No terrain mod tools available in game. > I would have expected these to be in, other then the map mod tool, they should be available while playing, payed for, certainly, but you should be able to buy some dirt and shove it along the shoreline to make a proper dam, or flatten that big mountain in the middle of your city.- Inability to modify the base maps. > if we can't have tools in game, why can't we open the default maps in the terrain modifier?- Water. > Don't get me wrong, love the water physics, though it does seem a little sluggish in places and crazy in others, bit hard to predict at times.These are the few issues i've noticed thus far in my 10 hours of gameplay, more might come up, but overall i am happy, just really, really missing the autosave and really really baffled by the emergency services.Rock on Paradox!

Instant Classic - 10/10When Cities: Skylines was announced last year I was super-hyped as it was from my favourite developer, Colosal Order, famous for Cities in Motion 1 & 2.  Furthermore, the sheer fact that it was a city builder and being aware how good Cities in Motion 2 was (350+ hrs I've put into it...) I was extremely excited but I guess you could say I was a bit aprehensive too.That apprehension is long gone.  This game is an instant classic, on par with the likes of SimCity 4.  Let me tell you why;Built to be moddable, at the time of writing (72hrs post release), there has been a staggering 6000 submissions to the Steam Workshop with some fairly advanced mods, it's not just the cosmetics.No more towns- up to 1,000,000 people can be simulated.  They all have their own homes, workpalces and families.  No more GlasBox nonsense from EA here, this is the real thing.Extremely accessible, with more advanced and micro-management available but slightly hidden away so that it's not intimidatingDid I mention this was made by just 19 people?There are obviously some minor hiccups here, nowhere near as bad as SimCity and no DRM or online nonsense either.  Day/Night cycles are gone and so are tunnels but the latter has already been planned as the first FREE DLC for Cities: Skylines.  Also, seeing as CO are a small team, the mod community are working tirelessly to work on the superb foundation CO have set for us - the vanila expereince is amazing but the sheer flexibility and moddability of this game will see this title have a life cycle similar to that of Sim City.  I can't wait to see what's next.Don't delay, you are getting unbelieveable value for money here for one of the best games in years to enter the genre.			"

												This game is a worthy successor to Sim City 4(Sim City 2013 was a flop, imo) that offers depth and quality worthy for any city builder enthuasist.  The game offers a diverse and massive modding community, which is a key to enhancing any city building game, and not to mention it's easily accessible with Steam Workshop.  This game also earns a plus on a near flawless release(when compared to its competition), and I have confidence that it become more than what Sim City 4 had became, in less amount of time(Sim City 4 does have a decade+ of development).  My only complaint, and it's merely opinion oriented, is I wish this game used a darker saturation for the color of its buildings and vehicles.  I personally wish they would have used a similar color scheme as Cities in Motion 2(for realism).  However, with the mod community, you are able to change this.  With that said, this is a must add for anyones library, you will not be disappointed if you enjoy city building.			"

 Yes it is the game you have waited for! I’ve watched Streamers for around twenty hours before picking this game up and after sinking a few hours into Cities: Skylines I can say this is a wonderful realisation of how a city builder can be done.The attention to detail is fantastic from its easy and slick UI to the ability to stalk and name anyone you choose. They have made the game wonderfully accessible and deceptively deep if you love the micromanagement side. I won’t list what this game does right and what others fail to do as others already have, all I will say is this game is well worth your time. Side note It amazes me how a small team of six (I believe fourteen now) can make this wonderful gem of a game that will no doubt become the next pillar for city builders meanwhile at EA and Maxis they mess up so badly. Regardless of the pedigree, cash and talent they had backing it. Fantastic job Colossal Order and more power to you.			"

												Absolutely phenomenal. The best City Builder I've played since Sim City 4. Has clearly learned from other city builder games with so many tools to fine tune construction in your city. My main complaint is the numbers/statistics are insane! 600 people dying a day out of a population of 56000?! So many bodies that 10 graveyards and 12 crematoriums can't keep up?! Jesus, just burn them in the streets man!

												Spent hours in this game! There is so much you can do.Pro and con: I feel the game is mostly about traffic and managing which I like, some may not.Con: fps drops significantly at high populations. But what bothers me more is these weird long pauses that all vehicles (trains, cars, taxis, trams, metros) take after they initiate an action. I guess simulations of >100k vehicles really slows the game down even though fps is at 30.			"

(of course now that the game has launched (per say) you wont get the preorder bonus but dont worry it was a fair bonus cool for those that did preorder but not to lame for the people who didnt get it)the extra stuff from dlx (i have yet to experience but i hope will be good!! extra stuff-----> Originally posted by desc: Original Soundtrack: 
This Original Soundtrack includes 14 unique tracks mixed from the ambient music of the game, allowing you to enjoy the wonderful music whenever you want. 

Digital Art book: 
See the concepts behind the buildings! The book features almost a 32 hand drawn concepts of the game various buildings and the story behind each.some of the other final great things about this game is that  WORK SHOPalot of games have workshop for/on steam now but i didnt expect this game to AND IT DOES!the workshop for this game consists of mods (remove the tweety bird sound  or things like that) maps (with a height map editor people are able to make maps very cool! I:e  U.S cittys Europe etc) asset mods (at least i think thats the name well any ways these mods change/add new buildings like a large                elementary school. probably the last good thing about this game is that according to a twitch streamer there is/will be free dlc like tunnels Cons: there are VERY FEW PROBLEMS WITH THIS GAME beleive it or notthe one major issue for me is the GOD DAMN TRAFFIC when your city gets to about 5,000 population ish traffic becomes a really big problem and instead of expanding or adding things to your city you spend time fixing your roads so if there were to be another name for this game it would be traffic simulator 2015 but the game is better to deserve such a demeaning tittle!!!C_O_N_C_L_U_S_I_O_Nthis game is worth the moneyworth the timeand highly reccomended.

												I definitely recommend this game.  I’m a long time Simcity fan going back to the middle school's computer lab playing Sim City 2000 in the year 1999 on a bright and beautiful iMac.  I even remember the teacher showing kids how to play the game.  What better way to teach kids the value of well funded schools?This game exists mostly because under the ownership of EA the Simcity series has really faltered.  Major technical issues and limitations and lost opportunities and hurt the series.This game is easy, much easier than any Simcity game I’ve played.  Some of it is easier because things just work better, like the water pipe systems.  The economics are just a lot easier.  I actually think this is more realistic.  I live in California, and here government funding isn’t really an issue, the issue is that throwing money at problems doesn't really help a lot.  Traffic isn’t an issue of money, it's an issue of what to do.  Same goes for crime, education, and especially water, or even pollution.  City skylines emulates this, money isn’t a big problem, but planning and management is the heart of the challenge.  ProsGreat aesthetics.  Night time is absolutely beautiful. The city looks great.So many options as far as roads, zoning, utilities, really fun variety.I like the easy economics which let you just focus on city building.Steam workshop and lots of mods.The size of the maps is amazing.  As your city grows you will unlock more and more land, faster than you could fill it.  It really puts Simcity franchise to shame.ConsIt's going to push your system a little bit, but luckily frame rate isn't super important in this genre.The mass transit bus/train stop system with routes feels a little clunky and odd to me.

												This game started off awsome, complete  with the whole new car smell - so to speak. I was sooo happy that it felt like simcity 4 but with a fully 3d integrated world and a fully rotational camera. Then as I continued to play I became overwhelmingly unimpressed with how ""unfinished"" the game was.The game has very limited ""Parks & Rec."" places to plop down and make people feel happy about where they live. You also cant ""Free place"" parks and a lot of buildings either as they are required to snap to a road... So if you find yourself in the alto familiar (atleast for me) situation where as your city grows some areas just dont fully integrate and create pockets of unbildable area, and so you decide you want to make a park or ""Pretty"" area in that awkward area - well you cant. You have to have a road running in there as you cant just make it a spruced up area... even if you dont care that it people cant useit because you just want the area to look better to you... you still cant do it without a road. The game also has limited utilities and services available and instead relies on the modding community to make up the difference in how little is actually available for what you pay for the game... If you can pick this game up for under $10 bucks its worth a buy to tinker with - Anything above that and you will likely be disapointed in this game due to how little you are getting for what you pay for. You will then have to turn to the modding commnity to get key portions of the game patched over with much needed features that should have been included.			"

												I've just started, but since this just came out I want to help the guys and girls still on the fence.   It reminds me Sim City 4, but with modern improvements! It is easy to play, and the game explains the core concepts as you go.  This is the city builder that we have been waiting for. Click Add to cart, now.  Before I describe the game, I have had absolutely no choppiness and I have the game maxed out.  If you have a quality PC you should have no issues running this game.You have 9 different maps to choose from.  There is no random map option, but there is an editor included that you can create your own maps or download maps from other players. So, you will always have new maps to play on.The game has a few interesting subsystems that work together.  The more educated your citizens are, the less trash they will produce.  Poorer the neighborhood will lead to more crime.  You have to keep your pollution levels down or you could risk tainting the drinking water of your citizens.There are multiple road options to allow you to truly customize the shape and direction of your town.Do you want to build a eco friendly paradise or do you want to build the biggest city that you can? The game gives you the tools for you to decide. Also, with the editors available there should be plenty of options coming from other players.For the old timers who remember Sim City on the SNES (I know it was PC first, but back then a SNES was a few hundred dollars and PC's were $2,000 easy) for everytime you reach a population milestone you level up your ability to add items to your city.

A prime example of the benefits of PC gamingCities: Skylines is what happens when you develop a game without consoles in mind. ✓ Fun and addictingHear me out: I've always avoided city building games like the plague because I thought they weren't my cup of tea. The free weekend came along and I thought ""why not?""... look at my hours now.✓ 100% moddableSpecific buildings of all types, colors and flavors, intersections, maps, different lighting settings, gameplay-altering mods... just about anything can be found in the workshop. Be warned though: using mods disables achievements.✓ Fair learning curveYou might think a game like this is too complicated, but the truth is... it's not. Cities: Skylines is as complicated as you make it. Sure, if you're a beginner (like me), your first cities will fail, but that's exactly what makes this game so replayable: you learn by failing, and it's fun as hell.✓ Endless possibilities and replayabilityRural town? Metropolis? European capital? Futuristic city? A replica of your town? The only limit is your imagination[gfycat.com]✗ No season passAs of now, they've released two expansions: After Dark and Snowfall. They'll release more, and that's good, but there's no way to buy a game+expansions pack, which means that no one knows the pricetag for the ultimate experience, and you might end up spending hundreds of euros in the game if they keep releasing expansions. You might think ""how is that a problem? If they release more content, I'll happily pay"". Well, look at Train Simulator. Would you pay 4,000€ for the full experience? I'm not saying Paradox will take the same route, but they could, and you should be wary.VerdictCities: Skylines has quickly turned into one of my favorite games. I've always liked scale models[www.archivisionmodels.com]. This game is like having your own, but alive. I thoroughly recommend it.			"

Perfect Example of City Building Simulator- The experience of building your city from essentially the ground up is a addicting and rewarding experience, however it can also be a brutal one depending on what problems crop up when you are building your city.- The animations are very good, especially when the buildings are being built. There is immediate satisfaction when buildings start to be built in the zones that you assign.- The ability to assign any area you want as a district and make it follow the unique policies that you set can be fun.- This game also brings a challenge as you ave to figure out how to make the traffic flow without any major traffic jams.It is definitely worth getting and especially if you got SimCity and was disappointed in the result of that game.

												95 hours of gameplay and I have only one city that is thriving. I almost reached to 100k people yet there is alot more to do. The achievement system, in my opinion, is great. For example, after increasing your population by, lets say 5000 people, new buildings unlock. These buildings help you build even a bigger city. To be honest though, it's slow and boring in the beginning. You can buy new square lands and increase the size of your city as your population is increasing. The economy isn't as hard as it is in SimCity so you can easily gain money. My only complaint is that you cannot buy all of these lands but fortunately there is a mod that can allow you to do that. Also, there aren't natural disasters but now they will soon add it as you can see from the DLC list! Can't wait for it!Enjoy and have fun building your own city!*Hint*: Use underground highway tunnels and roundabouts and connect them to another roundabout on the ground level so your traffic wont be so jammed. Also, dont make intersections so close to each other so there wont be frequent jams.  "

												Cities: Skylines is simply said a better Version of SimsCity. It's connected to the Steam Workshop, that means the creativity  is endless, you can install many many user generated content, so much that your game will explode. It's still worked on but i miss the updates. There's only one thing that I find very annoying: The Day-Night Cycle. The roads are every time full as hell and the Day is over before the cars have even reached the City from the highway. If that is fixed in a later version i would be completetely happy with Cities:Skylines.			"

 In short, the best game in its genre to date. BUY IT!  There's no way an ordinary schmuck is going to write a review to top Mayor Todd's, so, instead of the usual review that compares this game directly to similar games, here is a list of some fun things you can do in this game: 1) Play offline, with a smooth framerate and a sensible interface2) Build beautiful, sprawling 3D cities (rather than 2D grids or absurdist skyscraper hamlets), and view them with a few different color palettes3) Get Steam achievements4) Follow individual cars, trucks, buses, trains, and airplanes from realistic origin point to realistic destination 5) Micromanage public transportation, as in OpenTTD (which is free, btw.)6) Build or download  awesome highway interchanges, with ramps, bridges, and tunnels (like the double-paperclip interchange)7) Watch as trucks pile up in one lane of a six-lane road, causing fury and hair-tearing on your part(this is one of the few cons)8) Build ultra-modernist, utopian phalansteries that would make Le Corbusier proud9) Build facsimiles of older, Southern European cities (using ""European-style"" maps)10) Join the urban farming movement, only to watch your semi-realistic gravel roads get clogged with absurd numbers of tractors11) Cause disease due to sewage contamination, floods that disable buildings, and floods of contaminated sewage that causes disease and disables buildings, thanks to improper water management (water physics in this game are somewhat believable)12) Build a surfeit of fire stations, incinerators, and crematoria (or watch your people suffer)13) Build  OP monuments that give massive amounts of electricity, universal (cheap) health care, universal (cheap) education, huge land value increases, and other crazy benefits, after torturing your city to meet arbitrary/sadistic production requirements (e.g., health care satisfaction under 20%)14) See a whole bunch of generic Scandinavian buildings and vehicles that kind of look like they came from a kid's train set15) Speaking of train sets, this game lets you set up digital dioramas involving trains and transportation, and view them with Simcity 2013-style tilt shift shader (don't worry, you can turn it off if you don't like it)16) Make your own maps and interchanges using the built-in tools (or decorate existing buildings)17) Rename people, houses, businesses, and districts (or, for that matter, abuse eminent domain) to get the perfect ""feel""18) Make your own hiking trails and place trees manually along them for aesthetics19) Build huge, attractive residential zones, only to find that, forty years later, all the people there get old and die, thus overburdening your deathcare system, which spreads disease, which causes more death, which causes economic collapse, which causes industries to fail, which causes commercial zones to whine about not having goods or customers, which causes power outages when you bulldoze the commercial zones, which cause all the remaining citizens to pack up and leave.20) Spend 100 hours straight building one city, and forget about your family, your school, your job, and your overheating graphics card (until the game crashes and you lose your city... NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!) Here is a list of things you can do in this game with Workshop content and mods: 1) Play offline, sometimes with a choppier framerate2) Build even more beautiful cities, using EVEN MORE SPACE, and view them with a variety of different shader effects (such as ambient occlusion, edge detection à la Borderlands, ""godrays,"" and Dynamic Resolution)3) NOT get Steam achievements (unless you install another mod)4) Follow individual vehicles with a first-person view--and, for a greater challenge, reduce their speeds to make for realistic traffic congestion levels5) Micromanage public transportation a bit more (including dedicated bus roads, bypass passenger stations, public parking garages...)6) Build even better highway interchanges, with better lane controls (seriously, I've spent hours doing this)7) No mods to fix this one yet, though some help mitigate it8) Build post-modernist tract housing (à la suburban America), brutalist slums/housing projects, British row houses, and trailer parks (or ""caravan clubs,"" for you Brits out there)9) Build insane skyscrapers that tower unrealistically over pieds-a-terre and hipster-infested coffee shops, and then surround them with statues of evil hamsters and giant blobs of metal10) Make farms that kind of look like farms11) Cause tsunamis and massive floods12) This one's still a problem; why can't one or two crematoria be enough?!13) Build community-designed monuments that may, or may not, be overpowered14) Download tons of vehicles and growable buildings from the Workshop (from Coca-Cola trucks to Winnebago RV's to Fallout-esque shanties, complete with Nuka-Cola machines), and spice up your roads15) Did I mention that  realistic historical locomotives  are available on the Steam Workshop?16) Make buildings, mods, etc., and upload to Steam Workshop (for more adventurous types)17) Clone growable buildings to get the perfect aesthetic (believe me, this is cooler than it sounds)--or, better yet, place individual props yourself18) Make your own hiking trails, place trees with Tree Brush, and hike the aforementioned trails 19) Do that, but without the incessant Chirpy tweets of ""#movingout.""20) Spend 150 hours building your city; run into 65,536 object limit in game after getting to a population over 200,000... NOOOOOOOOOO!!!! ""Cannot place any more objects of this type.""Must... build... more... stuff... ""Cannot place any more objects of this type.""Must... build... more... stuff... TL;DR (99% of people say so after reading this review) BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!  "

												If you played and enjoyed SimCity but you are looking for a new game because SimCity repeats itself? Cities: Skylines is the game you are looking for. If this will be your first time in city-builder game, graphics and mechanics are way above than others. Dev team and community relationship is just awesome how it should to be for all games. Cities: Skylines is the city builder game everyone was expecting and deserved. It is a must-buy. Best bonus? Workshop!But yes, you will have traffic problem here, too.			"

												It's good and challenging but I wish there was more content. With SimCity (which inspired this game) you could modify buildings and there were random events. I also think adding a weather system as well as seasons would be nice too. I wish there were more tiers to unlock as the population gets larger and a main goal. It doesn't take that long to unlock everything.edit: I just read about the winter DLC coming soon.			"

												I bought this game yesterday. 24 hours ago. I already spent 11 hours in the game. That's about 46%. This game is more addictive then crack. Do buy, you'll not be dissapointed! As for some actual information:- Cool customisation tools for making parks, and completely inefficient roundabouts.- Great modding community (I haven't touched a mod yet, but I heard from a friend that his game takes 15 minutes to load due to the amount of mods he has installed, so there's a great amount of mod options to choose from)- ""Zoning"" tool for easy city building- Unlike other Paradox Interactive games, this game has a fairly simple UI. As a result Cities: Skylines should be pretty easy to get into. (Like those 11 hours I spent on this game already... I'm so going to regret not doing something productive. But hey, who cares right?)- As far as I can tell, the developer is active in making some great updates for the game, as well as listening to feedback from the community. To summarize, it's all good things really. I haven't come across any things that I don't like in this game, aside from some nit pick's (For example, once you really get your city going and you have some big roads laid down, it can get pretty hard to find the sources of problems, and therefore resolve earlier mentioned issues.). I strongly recommend that you get this game, if you have some free time to kill and 30 bucks to spare. "

The game is loads of fun, though demand seems to drop suddenly and not rise for long periods.  I love the game but I hate that electricity is not transferred through zones, though as zoning is free it does make sense.

												In 2014 EA and Maxis tried to jump on the train again continue the huge success of SimCity 4 with their new game SimCity(2014) but didnt manage to please the community due to small maps, huge server issues on release date, online pressure and overpriced DLC's.This year things are going to change the city building genre entirely - Paradox Interactive and Colossal Order are publishing Cities: Skylines and get immediately hit scores on sales!The game offers a huge map, which was the most important point that a modern city building game should deliver with even more extended space through several mods from the Steam Workshop. Also the game itself looks nice and offers a good usability for players. The  interface looks nice and most things in the game are already balanced.But now to the greatest part about this game: It's going to get further developed with more content updates and even a chance on multiplayer mode which would mean that SimCity is going to be completely useless. With an growing community and even an subreddit ( https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines ) this game is a great start for game industrie into the new year 2015.			"

												I must say, I am really enjoying the game. However, there are a few things I would like to mention.I have encountered a bug where dead people are not being picked up and taken to a grave or crematorium, just left where they are, even if said facilities are nearby.It would be nice if you could make it so you can fit small paths between houses so you don't have to destroy them. Plus, if a path or road being placed would change the housing setups, it should say. Normally it does but sometimes it will distort the road causing some houses to be destroyed.It would also be good if parks could be custom build, such as drawing them into holes within groups of housing, and gaining access to these parks with the better paths mentioned earlier.Last of all, but also probably of least importance, who expects you to provide your own cities power; there should be a way to plug into the national grid.Despite these, I have really enjoyed playing, and I plan to continue doing so. Well done on the great game!			"

												A great city-builder, this game takes all the best city-building game mechanics and puts them together in a well-balanced package.  The UI is a little obtuse in some areas, and not all of the important information is clearly conveyed, but you can get used to it.  Traffic is a big part of the game, and the quality of your road layouts will make or break your city.  Fortunately, the AI is very adept at pathfinding through your streets, and problem locations can easily identified by the traffic jams.  The economy is very easy and forgiving, so you can mostly just focus the fun part of designing and not have to worry much about micromanaging your economy.  Everything SimCity (2015) did wrong, this game did right.			"

												This is the city builder game that we have been waiting ever since SimCity 4, which was released 12 yers ago in early 2003. Cities: Skylines doesn't try to do any fancy new tricks like multiplayer or city connections. Instead it's an oldschool city builder game that we all love and it looks great. The game is already great as it is, but with any future DLC or expansion it will become even better. While I'm usually not a huge one of DLC's, I really like the way Paradox releases them. Every DLC seems worth the money as there a good amount of new content and they often include some of the stuff in free patch also. So while the game in my opinion is already the best city builder game to day, there's is so much more potential to it. Paradox is also known for their great support for modding and Cities: Skylines is not an expectation. If something is not in the game you can always make it yourself and there's a good change that someone has already done it. With the great modding support the game has nearly endless amount of potential so it will only get better as the time goes by. Just like SimCity 4 did back in the days.So if you are into the city building games, but you were disappointed with the crappy SimCity or/and the scam Cities XXL, then this is the game for you.  I can highly recommend the game for anyone who's interested of the games of this genre. It's by far the best one and will only get better.			"

												I LOVE this game. It's everything Simcity looked like it should have been. The entire city you manage is persistant and constantly evolving, meaning- people live, work, and commute to the same places in the same vehicle every day (you can click on cars and see who owns them!). and even eventually have familes and die. The game can be as simple, or as complex as you want, with the ability to create districts which allow you to set individual laws and regulations, turning industrial zones into farming areas with low taxes, residential into luxury apartments with high taxes, or specialized industy areas to gather resources like oil, coal, and wood (yes, forestry is a thing in this). Not to mention, EVERYTHING is renamable; Districts, people, and buildings.And buildings. You can't forget about the fact that you can MAKE and SHARE buildings, parks, and even maps with powerful, but easy to use in game asset editors. Its easy to go to the workshop, grab some maps, buildings, or lots you like and add them to your game!Placement of buildings is also important. A lot of buildings will create polution- but not just the regular type you would expect like smog and soil polution- many buildings will also create noise polution, and make people living near them very upset.It's like they took all the best features from the -old- simcity games (water pipes and power lines YAY!), re-engineered them, put their own twist on some things, and made a beautiful game out of it. Incredibly happy with this purchase, especially considering the wonderfully reasonable price. WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS!? BUY IT. :D			"

												Finally, a perfect blend of two classic genres: urban planning and traffic management. Especially traffic management. Although the game is meant to be a successor to Simcity 4 and an epic ""take that"" at Simcity 5, it's more of an expansion pack for Cities in Motion 2 since you'll be spending most of your time building costly road layouts and alleviating impossibly-complex traffic grimlocks originating from said road layouts. Thankfully this time you have a proper user-friendly GUI and grid/non-grid transition system to assist you when placing and aligning splines according to your OCD level. Be sure to always focus on transit-oriented development rather than classic suburban sprawl as this game is almost completely Northwest Euro-centric in nature.Compared to SC4 though, many vital elements are either oversimplified or nonexistent; whilst new concepts such as sewage disposal are shoved up your ♥♥♥ without regard to any learning curve, and normally mundane tasks become so overpowered such that it's an instant game-over if your rubbish trucks are too slow. (No, seriously.) Starting a new town, however, is considerably less tedious as there are in-built milestones to restrict asset requirements to your population growth level. But ultimately, this game is set in the present day, when your cims expect everything from power to water and even Internet services from the moment you zone your first residential area and have nearly zero tolerance or grace period for any unfortunate events; so treat all your peepur like stereotypical teenage white girls at all times or it's express bankruptcy for you. Whether take this as a challenge or setback, your mileage may vary. Interesting new features like fluid mechanics and restricted aviation pathways also help to determine your final city layout, reducing the monotony of the mid-game era.Personally, I feel that Colossal Order have definitely learnt from most of their mistakes committed in CIM2; whether or not Paradox published games' infamous DLC-spam policy also applies to this release is yet to be confirmed. Many of the other ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviews seem to be rants from starved city-building fanboys and SC5 haters who long-awaited a player-friendly magnum opus of the genre, praising CSL for the messianic role it plays in the wake of SC5's epic failure with little thought about the potential shortcomings of this hastily-released masterpiece. Even though flaws in the Unity Engine's ability to cope with the game design remain evident, it's clear why this game broke 1,000,000 purchases in about the time it took for Gangnam Style views to hit 100 times that number. And yes, you can mod that in-game too, for free.			"

												The review is this:  All the good stuff from SC5, none of the bad.  Where you got all of the bad stuff from SC5, Skylines has improved it to where it works.I am not writing this to badmouth SC5, I spent hundreds of hours playing it and enjoyed it for the most part except for the major concerns players had:No single highway in/out of your city causing major traffic bottlenecks.  The game allows you to expand your city to larger areas (Major concern of SC5 players).  The game includes Metro stations unlike SC5.  As far as public transportation you can not only place them but plan their routes like Cities in Motion.When you build roadways it will grid out exactly the depth of your city buildings construction of what you zone next to the road.  The highways are reconstructable to your liking.  The road tool to create curved roads was a little bit confusing on how to make the desired curved effect at first, but after a little while of experimenting it is not difficult and a much stronger mechanic then SC5.The thing I like the most is you are unable to construct High Density areas right at start.  You must start with Low Density and earn by population growth the higher density/metropolis buildings expected to see in a major city vs. a small town, i.e. small towns don't have nuclear power plants.  Civs will sort of trickle into your city little by little instead of having a massive population boom which undercuts your public services.All in all it is exactly what everyone was hoping for from SC5.For all the DLC complainers, I also own SC5 Cities of Tomorrow and found that enjoyable with all its problems, although I won't buy any more SC5 DLC's, if Skylines releases any DLC's I will be purchasing them as the developers obviously have learned from the catastrophic release of SC5 online play is not required.

												I keep calling this game SimCity inadvertently.  No, not in reference to the misfire from 2013.  Instead this game brings me back to the kind of fun I had playing the SimCity games of the past.Five days in after buying the game and I'm st ill building my first city.  After spending 18 hours (eep) I've expanded its borders as far as it will go, I've built a couple of the big unlockables, and I see no reason to stop with this city for now.There are issues with the game but it's phenominally good fun, intuitive, pretty good looking (even if not as polished as SimCity '13) and most important of all: there are no gamebreaking issues.  This is the best citybuilder in over a decade, and it continues the genre in fine tradition.Back to the issues...It could use more anti aliasing and the tilt-shift effect isn't as good as SimCity '13s.  These are minor quibbles.Road traffic doesn't seem to effectively use all lanes but once you learn some tricks to laying out your roads you can mitigate some of the traffic issues.  In this regard it's still better than SimCity '13.Rail traffic seems to be the wonkiest thing I've encountered.  Trains keep getting jammed up and stopping without any clear indication of where they're trying to go.  I may have made mistakes in laying out the tracks and stations so I'm still trying to figure out if this is something I've caused but something just feels off.Dealing with dead bodies and trash takes some getting used to, traffic can hold up their removal (and police, ambulances and firetrucks).  Abandoned buildings are also a bit of a nuisance because you are encouraged to bulldoze them, but they also seem to take care of themselves if there's demand for growth (they'll get torn down and rebuilt automatically).  That said leaving them up if there's not demand reduces the happiness/land value of the immediate area so bulldozing is a good idea unless they turn around quickly.TLDR: This game is $30, awesome fun, works great, active and extensive modding community.

												I have been patiently waiting for this game for months. Now, finally it's out. I am beyond satisfied! Admittedly the bar was low after the fiasco that is Cities:XXL (Focus Home Interactive), and the highly publicized issues SimCity (2013) had. That being said, this game vaulted over this bar like a human stepping over ants who are playing limbo. Clearly analogies aren't my strength, but this isn't the point! The point is, you should buy this game for several reasons. * It's fun as hell. I mean, that's number one by far.* It is inexpensive compared to AAA titles by big douchey companies. If you're on the fence, bite the bullet. Especially if you like city building games like SimCity or CitiesXL. This blows them out of the water.* The developers (Colossal Order) made this game out of a passion for the genre. This really shows in the detail of the game.* It's moddable/customizable. Amazingly so. Within two hours of the game there were over 200 entries on the workshop. That is how open they were about this game to modders before it was released.  I don't want to rant too much because I am clearly a happy player. I never really write reviews for games, but I felt the need to do so for this one. Get it and enjoy, you won't regret it!			"

												Fantastic game!Anyone who's played SimCity before will have an idea what to expect here. Start out with a small town town, slowly build it up, generate funds and expand your city. The game is immersive straight off the bat, with a gental learning curve. It's the sort of game that will suck you right in, with hours going by without you noticing it. You'll spend your day thinking about modifications you're going to make when you get home. It's really that good.The game works by permitting development through the zoning of land. Different zones will permit different kinds of development. It's all held together by a road network (and later on a subway/train/plane network) that you'll constantly have to plan for and tweak. Services such as sewerage, water, electricity as well as services such as garbage, police, firefighters, ambulances, morgues, parks and education are all accounted for. It's a game of balance, a bit of that here a bit of that there. As the City grows, the game rewards you with more zones, services, buildings, etc, slowly dripping you the goodies as you progress rather than overwhelming you at the start.The game is super accessible, and whilst punishing earlier on, is rather easy once the ball gets rolling. My girlfriend had a go and succsesfully set up a city on her own.Whilst the game is super amazing, like every game it has it's minor problems. There is a lack of an endgame. Once you hit a certain point, it feels almost like a last section of the game is missing. Super high residential, mega-matropolis expansion pack please, with plenty more features! Furthermore, whilst I view the easy difficulty as a positive, many will feel the lack of challenge once the money starts to roll in. Roads play an important part of the game, but feel very volatile and hit/miss when placing them in complicated patterns. I feel like these things will likely be addressed over time as the game matures and mods set in. The workshop is already looking plentiful despite a recent release.Must-buy game, definately will be top 3 games of the year, especially with all this AAA+ trash that gets released these days.			"

												Very enjoyable game, 4.5/5 or 9/10.+Nice enough graphics give enough realism.+Zoning works well with fill, square or circle.+Hundreds if not thousands of models so even the tiniest zones can be filled.The negatives are mostly nitpicks, but it must be brought to the attention of you, the reader.-Motorways/Highways. So if you have traffic backing up onto a motorway, why do people who do not want to come off there stay in the 1st lane? I'm sorry, but you are an idiot if you sit in lane 1 in a queue waiting to come off at a later point.-General traffic flow. As a Brit, I set it so traffic travels on the left, but it applies to both. If you're on the outside trying to turn to the outside, and they are on the inside trying to turn to the inside, YOU CAN BOTH GO AT THE SAME TIME!-Six lane roads. Similarly to above, traffic in lanes 2 and 3 stop if someone wants to join lane 1. Just use One Way 2 Lane roads, they work much more effectively. Also, if you have a road joining to head northbound, it does not interrupt southbound.-Roundabouts. Everything about them. As above, people in lane 2 wait for someone coming into lane 1. Traffic annoyance.-Proximity. Again, these are nitpicks, but they need to be sorted. If you have your 9 2x2km chunks all in a line and have services (for example, ambulance) at both ends, why do the ambulance drivers from one end even consider crossing through the busiest city in this instance of game to help someone with a cold at the other side? I have caught ambulance drivers crossing over 3 chunks of land to get to a midly ill patient when the patient lives NEXT DOOR TO A HOSPITAL! We need proximity priority!As I said, these are nitpicks. However, when you want to create a well-planned city and the only thing dragging it down is the fact that people can't go from left to left and right to right on the same junction at the same time, causing the entire motorway to clog up all the way out of your city boundries, it's rather annoying.I would still recomend the game though, because it's just plain damn fun. Let's not forget the game is still in early access and even if this guide is putting you off buying, get it none the less so the devs can fix the bugs earlier!			"

												Excellent!. Ive extensively played every single Simcity that came out with at least 100 hours on each title. Up to 400 on SC2000 and about the same on SC4, except SC2013 which was, after playing 4 hours, so worthless that i ditched it.I have been playing quite alot now, mainly working on 1 city and changing/altering it and trying out new things inside it.It is a great city builder! It looks good, feels good and plays good. The interface is neat and intuitive.Some people whine about having to place electric cables and sewage/waterpipelines.... i love it! Finally its back, i have to build a network of pipelines and cables to make sure that electricity and water comes around properly. What SC2013 did was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you lay down roads and automatically there power and water? give me a break. The only thing i kinda miss is some more depth in the economics, those feel a bit flat and shallow. The districtpolicies-system tries to adjust that but gives only few options and isnt satisfying enough (for me).Colossal Order does a great job already at bugfixing and is actively involved and interested in making their game even better. This is their 3rd title and also their biggest. A title that they claim is something theyve always dreamt of making so the support from them is expected to be big, especially with over 500.000 copies sold so far and rising.Other than that, this game comes right next to SC4 and thus becomes its only true heir. Job very well done by Colossal Order and Paradox.A must-have for any city-building afficionado, its pricing is excellent. Its alot of game for a very good price. (games should never cost more than 30,- euros in my opinion)I absolutely recommend this game			"

												Was a bit disapointed when they left Cim & Cim 2 pretty quick in a dark corner. But somehow ik get the feeling that they needed to give there full potiental into a full City builder instead of some transport management game.BUT >> They did make it right in a lot of ways ... on the first look you see a mix of cities XL and SimCity 2013 but when you start exploring and playing the game you get a total different feel !!This is actually the game that we would accept from EA in the form of SimCity if it was made like this game was made. But EA and SimCity Failed then and Cities XL and XXL are complete Feelingless games and runs even crap on a Monster of a PC.ssThis game has almost everything just right, Not to heavy on the Grafics but still looks Great, Good code writing and you can make BIG ♥♥♥ Cities and even than it still runs Great! Since a long time i realy get a good city building feeling and the indus districts and they different layouts and products are really good and working ideas. Traffic system is pretty advanced, Water is very smart and lovely to see it moves especialy when playing with Dams. With the Mod support and asset tools ingame from day 1 makes it even better !!! Guys and Girls ... If you cried the day that you played SimCity 2013 and lost your hope of any good City Builder game.. Cities: Skylines just Renewed that hope and fullfilled a great part for me. I am going to have a lot of fun with this game :-)Pros:> No EA, No Online DRM ( Steam only \o/ )> Delivered a non Broke game on day 1> Big ♥♥♥ Cities (even bigger with Mod)> Good City Builder Feeling> Mods on day 1Cons:> Day/Night cycle			"

I can safely say this 30$ game will keep me occupied for years to come with it's immensly large building areas which can be even further enhanced with mods. The custom maps, one which I found for Portland Maine. Which I frequently visit, inspire me to create themed masterpieces. Or I could just make a city in the shape of a ♥♥♥♥♥..... Maybe both.The moral of the story is, if you like city builders. You HAVE to purchase this game.			"

It takes the best bits from recent City builder sims and pieces them together to make a really enjoyable experience, if you've played this type of game before you'll feel right at home almost immediately. But even if you haven't, you'll pick up the basics in no time. It's not perfect, no, but the devs have many plans for the future and support seems very good, unlike the Cities XL games.			"

												I have only played a few hours of this, but its the most impressive city builder I have played since Sim City 4. This is what hard-core fans of the city building genre have been looking for since Sim City 4.Gameplay: 8.5/10The gameplay is fun and addictive with a focus towards solving challenges with road systems and infastracture being the core element of the game as-well as being creative, its a very relaxing and fun task to build your city up and never seems to get boring. The weaknesses is its depth, the game does everything well but doesnt excel in any areas in particular.Graphics: 8/10The graphics are very pretty and defiantly up to 2014 standard. It lacks proper anti-aliasing in some areas and I found the blur filter overwhelming in areas.Sound:The sound is very well done and I have no complaints about this.			"

												I know that this game has got a lot of love in terms of mod content. If I talk about negative points in this game or positive ones they can be fixed or enhanced with mods. If you do buy the game you should try them out. I love how the game provides you the freedom to do whatever you want. You need water,sewage power and roads and from that point you can start building districts and creating your own city without any restrictions. If you don't consider slope a restriction, it shouldn't be considered as one because you can terraform. I noticed while building my cities that I still didn't use all the buildings that are available in this game that's because there are so many options. The transport options in this game are also pretty elaborated. You can build airports, trainstations, harbors, tramstations and busstations. The game also provides a good dose of challenge if you are willing to expand your city a lot. Starting from 60000 population, which is a truck load of people and can't be done in a day, you unlock monuments. For each of these monuments you have to complete challenges to unlock the building itself. Some of these challenges really require you to screw up your city and survive, for example lower your taxes to 5 procent and survive for 5 years. If that isn't enough you have to get back to the point that you were at before the challenge and then save up around a million. If that isn't enough challenge I don't know what is to you.Although this a pretty good game there are some important downsides. Starting with traffic as the main issue. First off the highways leading to your city are way too small. It prevents you from fixing traffic without bulldozing as much of that highway as possible. They are very inefficient, if they were bigger they would be more useful. Another way how traffic clogs up is the bus system. In one city I made around 200 buslines, which is many but it was an experiment, half of my traffic was bus because each line had like 30-50 busses driving on it. I find it unrealistic and unnecessary to have that much busses on a line. I think setting a maximum to 10 per line, or even 5 per line, is definitly enough. Second we have the income system, not that it is something general it is more a visual issue to me than it may be to you. You see next to your money amount how much you earn per week but you gain money daily and I don't get why. It is way easier for the player to understand what is happening when it's either gaining money per week and seeing how much you earn per week than doing the two combined for some reason. Another thing I find unfortunate is the limitation. You start of with 1 plot of land and you can only expand 8 more plot, which is not a lot to me.Overall a good pickup to play once in a while with or without mods.			"

												Cities: Skylines is without a doubt the best city builder/simulator to date. Just imagine all of the other city builders/simulators you've played now combine the best parts and you get this, plus more.What I liked:User Interface- All of the menus and tooltips are very polished and very legible. Extremely easy to use. Simple in overall design, it won't overwelm you.Great Population Simulation- The simulation is very percise especially when it comes to street traffic. It also exists litterally its not just numbers/math in the background. You can see and track whats occurring in the simulation, The combined functions of health, education, police, etc work extremely well and effect the population with the most realisism in the genre. Funding litterally affects performance by limiting say a hospitals actual resources less ambulances, less beds, less doctors has effects that you can really see in the whole simulation. Traffic effects the performance of all elements the use roads. As resources are litterally transported in vehicles and the longer it takes for them to get there stops functionailty of other systems. Well Balanced Population Needs- The creation and coverage of services/leisure correctly influence the land value and allow the population to upgrade its businesses and homes in a detailed and sensible fashion.Excellent Power and Water Grid Simulation- When not enough water/electricity is being generated the furtherest structures based on the distance of connections through other building and powerlines/pipes are the building effected by it. Meaning that the grid actually exists rather then just being production minus requirement.Procedural Appearance/Connections- There is no grid that strictly defines where structures and roads are built. Instead you can draw curved roads that have correct appearances. Building built on curves will connect visually to the nearby structures and roads accurately. Intersections and changes to road types merge well.Policies- you can have global policies and specific policies. You can mark your own custom areas for the specific policies. Many of the policies actually have useful effects that also are shown in the overall simulation.Information Views- Selecting a service in the menus or specifically activating the contextual informative view has a complete full 3-D and statistcal analysis that is easy to understand.Dynamic WeatherTerraforming- The tools for changing the ground itself are also easy to use and the terrain has a very detailed mesh so hills, etc look very smooth.Water Physics - The water bodies actually feature flowing water. Terraforming and Canals will manipulate water flow. You can flood your city. This is also import when it comes to building dams as water has a rate of flow based on the terrain its flowing through.City Specializations- Resources are fully simulated. As in they are not extracted for a single purpose/objective. Normal industry actually needs the materials to function. Industry will either import resources from outside of your city or get it from within your city. Resources can only be found in certain areas in the map or not at all. When you create industry zones over a resource they will need to be specilized using the policy zones. When you've picked say agriculture the industry zones will become farms. The farms performance depends on the quality of the area. The normal industry and commercial structures will use generated resources. If you produce more than your city needs the goods will be exported out of the city.Continuing Development- The game is being expanded upon through dlc paid content and some free patches. Getting seasons gameplay is a paid dlc while the canals and terraforming were added for free. The paid dlc adds seasons, new Night related simulations with new commercial options, and a new public transportation option. The free patches added; road conditions and servicing, dynamic weather, terraforming and canals, stadiums, custom themes and other specific buildings. Do remember if we want to see more in the game they can't do the work for free.Mod Support- Mods are fully supported allowing quite substantial changes. Some could be considered cheating, but for the most part many of them are graphical changes and upgrades. The most useful Mods that are not cheating are very helpful. Things like deeper traffic analysis and tracking, Manual road Intersection options, custom road speed limits, protractors for drawing roads, along with many others. Many of the things missing from the vanilla game can be found as mods as well as nicer graphics to change up the look of things.Things I disliked:Engine Bottleneck- Eventually you will have such a large city that the simulation will become to much to process. Observing the hardware however the engine is making full use of the processor.  Your maximum city size without taking a performance hit is determined by your processor bottlenecking if you don't have a good one, but eventually you will start losing performance regardless. Performance/Graphics- The graphics are okay, but when you start getting a lot of structures in your city. The graphics card usage gets unreasonably high for what you get. Your maximum city size without taking a performance hit is determined by when your graphics card bottlenecks. The default appearance of the game colour wise is very dull. Theme mods get you past this.Broken Tourism- After Dark has rendered tourism useless and even without After Dark seems to have very little useful functionality. This has been the case for quite a while now.Final Summary:The developers are releasing patches to optimize the engine along with new features. Optimization aside you will still find the game very playable. Even with broken tourism its still a lot better then the competitors in its current state. I'm sure you won't regret supporting the games further additions and fixes if you pick it up today.(I will remove or change the negatives if they are resolved)			"

												Cities: Skylines is incredibly addictive - the detail of the simulation, especially around traffic management makes this city sim strategic. Creating a city is very simple, but crafting a large sprawling metropolis that works well requires careful consideration. Lots of options for customisation to make this game play how you want it to - definitely recommend.			"

												I have only played a few hours of this, but its the most impressive city builder I have played since Sim City 4. This is what hard-core fans of the city building genre have been looking for since Sim City 4.Gameplay: 8.5/10The gameplay is fun and addictive with a focus towards solving challenges with road systems and infastracture being the core element of the game as-well as being creative, its a very relaxing and fun task to build your city up and never seems to get boring. The weaknesses is its depth, the game does everything well but doesnt excel in any areas in particular.Graphics: 8/10The graphics are very pretty and defiantly up to 2014 standard. It lacks proper anti-aliasing in some areas and I found the blur filter overwhelming in areas.Sound:The sound is very well done and I have no complaints about this.			"

												Down right the best City building game out there.Ive always love Sim city since the very first, and with the last one being such a disapointment at launch, this game brings alot back what we miss in Sim city.  +Beautiful grapics, +the biggest plus of this game is expanding your city+the game is open for modding, infact the tools are already in game, +map creator +great road tool, small roads, highways, curves, bridges, its got everything,   and tunnels soon to come in future patch. +build a dam for power, and try not to flood ur city+dumping waste into the river,  sure sounds bad, and it is... but its soo cool to watch, lol..  feel sorry for any cities down river.. +Got the game on Launch, and have not once had a crash, or bugs, this is how games should be released This is a great game, really enjoy it, and looking forward to upcoming DLCs if any, and mods			"

												Very relaxing game. Easy, satisfying and very pretty. I never sought beauty inside a city until now. Workshop items help you make anything from Victorian London to Coruscant. Very powerful features - first person view - individual doods simulation and generally a well made game. I'm struggling to find a conn here but here goes. The traffic. It takes waay too much time to sort out properly. It's not even challenging it's just not in the tempo of the game. For every 20 minutes you spend building a part of your city, you then must spend 40 min to sort all the little traffic indicator thingies to be green (green is good). It's just something that we could do without but then the game would truly be very easy.			"

												Being a player and user of many simulated games in my long time playing simulated city games, i found this one too be great. I love the atmosphere of it and the building in it. In my opinion, it is not too hard like i found some A-Train simulator games, but not too easy either, like city life simulators. It is right in the middle of difficulty. It might not be too friendly to new users who have never played a city simulator, it does have nice tips in the game to be helpful. Also, the modding community for this game seems very active and looks like it will be for a long time. Because of the pleasant atmopshere and how the game is adding things quite a bit, and the modders beautiful works for this game, i give it a very good positive review due to many of these facts. I hope you enjoy it as much as i do. Thanks for reading!			"

												I've just only dipped my feet in this game and it has already proven to me to be the next recommended city builder. With the latest disappointment coming from titles like Cities XXL and SimCity (2013), Skyline gives the users a fresh and fun experience by handing them the many tools to create an amazing city of their own. As most people know, city builders are simple in concept when it comes to meeting the demands. However, city builders like Skyline focuses much more on the meta ranging from traffic management, water treatment and noise pollution.This game even comes in with built in steamworks and from what I've seen a pretty loose one with already +12k mods and assets to boom.The price is exceptional and the amount of hours you can spend on your city is plentiful. I would recommend for all city builder enthusiast and casual gamers alike.			"

												I can't tell you how many times out of my almost 200 hours I've restarted cities as new mods came out and traveling around IRL gives me ideas on how to lay out a damn road. And now that After Dark came out...125/10 I'm making a new city again :DOn a serious note:I love the gameplay of C:S. The controls are smooth, the modding community is awesome (and I mean, it's up there with the Skyrim modding community for me, and that's really freakin high), it's the best City Builder that I've played, and I highly doubt anything can top it. Then CO/Paradox adds more to the game, and it just keeps getting better and better.Long Live City: Skylines!			"

												this review is gonna be in 2 parts ( the game itself and comparing it to other City builders games)PART 1:  the game itself.Cities Skyline is a City builder game,  it runs smoothly  on  most machines but not on older ones or laptops , it requires allot of power to run. the game only have 1 mode which is build your own city.  u manage the needs of the citizens from electricity education and other services.  until you build a city big enough to expand and manage the traffics ...etcthe Price tag is acceptable for what the game offers. if u are new to these type of games its a good entire point. the end game is lack luster though but if u reached that level u alreay have inversted 40-60 hours inOverall its worth while. so I recommend it as it's the best city builder game available on steam.--------------PART 2 : Comparison to other city builder games. 1- SimCity5 (2013)the game UI is very similar which is nice, cause u don't need to relearn stuff from scratch . the game graphics in cities skyline is kinda better. but almost similar to Simcity.cities skylines have very Huge building area compared to simCity Which has some major Pros  and cons at the same time.what simcity was aiming at when they did give u small areas is to give the players more challenge on how to manage their city as u cannot build everything in one city thus increasing the replayablily  of the game. where in cities skylines u only need to build 1 city and manage it. there are no neighboring cities to interact with.also in SimCity5 have online multiplayer mode. as u can play with your friends making the best use of your cities co-op to build a huge workplace the benefit the entire region.unlike cities skylines the end game is lackluster. I only spend playing  40 hours and already built everything in the city reached the final stage and have no problems with my city. only build cemeteries all over the place.only real issue with simcity5 is their launch disaster .[so the final verdict is that simCity5 is far more superior version than cities skylines]2- cities XL at first i thought this is another installment of that franchise . but i was wrong.  if we look at these 2 games Cities XL is way more complicated than this game. overly complected and their UI is messy  unlike cities Skyline where it runs more smoothly than that game. Cities XL do not offer expansions of the cities but gives you Huge area to play with. u can still interact with other cities using Token system.  but beyond that nothing els.from my experience with both games I prefer Cities: Skylines over Cities XL series.

												Cities Skylines is a modern city builder with many possibilities. For large scale projects you can build a busy bustling city with airport, freight train stations and metro stops galore, or for something more intimate you can create a quaint country village or a farming community.With so many options and possibilities you may think that the game would be overwhelming, but with features unlocking as you go along, you are introduced to what you need to know in good time.Little fun additions like 'Chirpy' is a great way for your residents to give feedback to you, the Mayor of the city.  More and more mods appear every day making this a versatile, fun and intricate simulator.  Highly recommend this game.			"

												Have played 20 hours and already made 3 cities so far. Retried it because of bad traffic, people complains dead body, no needs new commercial and dam was placed wrong.It is so hard to plan it at first game. Everytime i planned for the new city, it always turn to a bad idea and i have to be creative to solve many problem. It is like planning before working on new software project. Plan first, but need creativity at the end.So far :Pros :- Beautifull graphic, especially water simulation.- Too detail. I could see my ""sims"" walking around the town, so do the vehicles.- Nice feature (district, making power line, need pipe for sewer and water)- Easy for moding- Can create our own map!- The trafic flows perfectly- The budget is usefull in this gameCons :- There are some annoying bug (my pipe drain couldn't work although there is power. Need to replace it until it works)- The game pace is too fast. I could get new land at although my city is still small. - The price for buying new land is too cheap. How can new land is cheaper than my drain pipe.- Some traffic's flow is annoying. The decision for choosing side of road by driver is just for the direction for next intersection.- Stll lack of variety of model. Especially, when building is high level.So far it is great city builder game in market. You could design your own city freely. Tools of making road is userfriendly and the UI is so minimalize so you could get all information fast. And then, i played a lot of Paradox games and they give their sincere for their game, in which you will get e new expansion for every 2-4 month!My life is in danger now. I rather play this game than eat :( Luckily, i am in distance relationship, so there is no other bussiness which could hold me to play this game. THANK YOU CO! Paradox!			"

												This game is very nicely put together, and I hope to continue to see the game grow and advance over time.The game RUNS PERFECTLY FINE on LINUX!However, to do so, there are a few things you must ensure before trying to play the game. 1. Have UPDATED video drivers. Nvidia 345+ is required. Lastest version of flgrx and intel video drivers are also REQUIRED.2. Ensure your audio system is updated (pulse, oss, etc).3. Ensure the following are fully updates: kernel, util-linux, sed, and coreutils.I am on Fedora 21 and the ONLY problem I ran into playing the game, was the loading screen would 'freeze' and sit there while game sounds played in the background upon loading a world. Clicking off-program fixed the screen, until you re-focused into the game and then it would show the frozen screen again. To fix this, DISABLE the steam in-game overlay, and run the game in borderless-window mode (on steam, use launch option -popupwindow, and set in-game display setting to windowed mode, relaunch client, problem fixed)Occasionally my sound driver would break and play very staticish sounds for the game, after a short time they would fix themselves. Updating coreutils and pulseaudio fixed this for me.Overall I was skeptical to try the game due to the overwhelming amount of negative reviews from Linux users due to performance and playability, I caved in and tried it anyway and was not dissapointed in the slightest. I am quite impressed with the game overall, and have not had any other major performance issues, I now have a 40k population city and still do not lag or have FPS drop, tho occasionally, you should save game and re-start client as it will get a tad laggy, but I experianced the same issue on Windows 7 aswell.System Specs: OS: Fedora 21 x64CPU: AMD FX 4300 x4 3.8gHzMB: ASRock 880GM-LE FXGPU: EVGA NVidia 650GTXRAM: 16GB non-ecc Corsair 1666HD: Hitatchi 6TB hard diskKernel version: 3.18.8-201NVidia Driver Version: 346.47			"

												It's a quality game, but it's lacking a few basic features, such as the ability to auto-connect multiple intersections in one go. Instead you have to connect each segment manually. It gets pretty tedious!And then there's the lack of a planner mode. A mode that would allow you to lay out the city in advance without any costs incurred. This would have helped with basic zoning and planning. Instead, I end up spending nearly all of my starting budget on ROADS...just to chart the damn city.It's a bit annoying at times. Especially that fake twitter thing. A simple status update window that you could close into a tab would have been better than having a persistent blue-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-bird hovering over your monitor the whole time.But if I had to pick a game between Cities: Skylines and Cities XXL, I would choose Cities: Skylines, because it's an actual, honest to goodness game release, and not a copy-paste scam.

Not an unique style, basically it is like sim city, BUT, while sim city had huge mistakes, this game improved the gameplay and did not include this mistakes. So all in all, this is THE must have for every simulation/build-up fan out here.

			Cities Skylines: Quick Look (City building Simulation, gameplay, and review) Is Cities: Skylines the Sim City we've all been waiting for? ""Quick Look"" is our short impression series of various games.		

Cities Skyline gives the player everything you would expect from a proper modern city builder game. It has expansive maps, detailed cities and population, intricate micro management, yet it's accessible and easy to pick up.Graphically the game is a looker. With detailed models, atmospheric filtering effects, and all the little things happening when you zoom in, the game look and feels alive. The audio design is immersive with the hustle and bustle of the crowds and traffic pulling the player in. Though the music seems over dramatic and on default settings it's strangely loud, but it does the job at keeping the player company.Mechanically the game can get deep when you learn all the details, yet the basics to get going is pretty easy. With that said, the game still requires a degree of self research as all the finer details in it's mechanics aren't always fully explained. Overall Cities: Skylines is a very enjoyable city builder, and at it's core, every thing I wanted from a modern Sim City.Pros:- Easy to learn- Lots of fine detail to micromanage- Great looking, very immersive- Supports mods- Huge map to build onCons:- Finer detail mechanics aren't always explained well- Some quality of life issues could use smoothing outCities: Skyline hours played at recording: 22Completion Status on Cities Skyline: N/AThis copy of Cities: Skyline was purchased on Steam			"

												Can't...Stop...Playinggggg!!!!Arrragh!I have to be honest that I pirated it before I purchased it. The reason is simple: I was skeptical whether a team consists of roughly 10 people would be able to deliver a game matches its price. You know, think about EA's SimTown...And that infamous Cities XXXXXXXL...Not trying to make excuse anyway. Just don't want to be let down.And after log into the game and start playing, it's like time slitting away from my palm. Normally in SimTown as long as you cover the city limit with buildings there will not be much point keep playing on it and in Cities XXXXXXL long before that it's going to lag to unplayable. So generally I will not be absorbed in it and will eventually lose interest and get a life. However in Cities: Skylines I have already obtained ""Metropolitan"" title and the city just looks astounding. There are much, much more buildings in my metro than you can ever build in SimTown or Cities XXL, nevertheless the game is still smooth like hell. I mean it. I'm using a Core i5 and GForce 750M laptop and the fan is blazing, but any camera pan/ rotate will be in order immediately. The mechanics is similar to simtown. Nothing can be blamed since simtown has already got a pretty good system, yet of course the bloody ""seperate township“ has to be excluded. Notable differences include the induction of ""Noise"" and power grid, etc etc. The power grid system is a bit unrealistic since as long as your suburb is extended to the point you would like electricity to flow into you don't need to pull high-voltage wire to connect it to the power plant. Clearly it can not be achieved otherwise we'll not see utility poles around in our daily life.  (Sorry to be pedantic but I'm doing electrical engineering :( You can open an economy panel and tune tax rate/ policies however this bit is oversimplified IMHO. For instance there is not much noticeable effect if you change the tax rate for houses except your income. The graphic is not bad. You can complain it to be rough and undetailed, but I would rather want smoothness over a bit of detail, since with the game itself lag like s*** nobody will ever interested in zooming in to examine the minutiae of the city. Tweeting system is freshening but annoying in late game. Developer might want to expand the dictionary.This game is even equipped with a tool to form the terrain your city will be situated on. Even with a tool to enable importing of geographical data to automatically generate height offset! You know, I am currently using double screens, with google map on one screen and the game on the other, trying to create a city of Melbourne. And after terraforming, I am going to copy the city of Melbourne, street by street, building by building, onto it. What if you can't find the exact building in the game, you may ask.Create it then. This game has building creation tool. Pretty much like it in Spore. See, the replayability is vast. How amazing will it be, if you duplicate your hometown onto it, and do a bit of experiment on it maybe? Blast your home away from it? Merge this road with another to see the impact on traffic? Do whatever you like. It's your city.20/10TL;DR : BUY IT.			"

												Cities Skyline is a great game if you like to build modern cities. The road system is incredibly well done. I like how they chose to link zones directly to roads. Everything feels neat and clean. It has in-game tools for creating your own maps and game assets. You can create, for instance, a custom power plant with your own model or build it out of pre-existing models and determine it's stats such as cost and power output. Best of all your creations can easily be posted to the steam workshop and the game is incredibly mod-friendly. I like almost everything about the game; in fact my only major complaint is that the game is too easy. It's virtually impossible to ""lose"" at cities skylines. Even if you play like a complete idiot, going bankrupt is very rare unless you want it to happen. You can just have insanely high tax rates and let people move in, get totally reamed, leave angrily only to come back later. You could be the worst mayor who ever lived and make millions with ease. With the exception of losing a valuable structure to a fire or something, there's virtually no consenquences to anything you do. Some might say it's not about winning or losing, aiming instead for effeciency, but there's a fine line between ""min-maxing"" (making your city as effective as you can) and having no challenge whatsoever. Sim City 3000, for instance, was much harder to get into the green; requiring you carefully plan your city or to plague it with casinos and toxic waste dumps (which were unique buildings you can only build when given the opprotunity to do so) in order to get ahead. Whenever you had enough money to build something big, it really mattered. You had to decide if you wanted a new hospital or some reinforcement to your educational system - and if you would have enough income to support your new object. Expanding your city size and adding more zones was also a very careful decision players made in Sim3K, because if you could not adequately support a new burst of population it could mean trouble. There were legitimate consequences to your actions - cranking up tax rates won't just make people leave, they will riot and start fires. Even with Skyline's ""hard"" mode which is tucked away as an optional mod you can turn on (right next to infinite money) the game feels way too simple at times.Ultimately if you just wanna mess around and build stuff, Skylines is obviously a massive upgrade to the original sim games - but it's kind of terrible as an actual game that imposes challenges and problems you have to overcome. With modding, though, I'm sure the community could find a way to make the game more difficult. The game has a good soundtrack (pretty sure I hear some references to older SimCity music in there, too), cozy aesthetics and enough variety to keep most players entertained for at least 20 to 30 hours. Definitely a good purchase for both people who like city builders and those who are new to the genre.Rating: B+PS: Death to chirper.			"

												There’s a lot of tools and a lot to learn. Across the bottom of the screen is a toolbar that contains all the stuff you need to create your city. Initially there is only a limited selection for you to play with. As your population grows more tools become available and the pacing is just perfect.Features like global policies that can reduce power consumption or increase fire safety are introduced at a rate that never feels like a bombardment. The same goes for buildings and services. Rather than a sit down and read endless pop-ups style tutorial features are gradually introduced so that only small explanations are needed at each stage. It really lets you get hooked even during those often tedious early learning stages. Another reason Skylines is so fun straight from the start is that each and every tool you use is so effortless.There’s a zone system used that is very similar to everyone’s favourite Sim City game. But again the tools are there for you to make your life easy. Streets come ready equipped with grids attached that you can either paint one square at a time, use a paint brush tool or even a fill tool to create entire blocks easily. Then waiting just a little time everything comes to life as buildings are erected and citizens go about their daily lives.All this simplicity isn’t to imply that Skylines isn’t complex. Underneath the user friendly interface there are a set of menus and tables that reveal some of the numbers that lie beneath. Finances, happiness, healthcare, education, crime and transport are all detailed enough to make Skylines worthy of any city building fan.The only thing that some may not like is the slightly sandbox style, especially later in the game. Once the learning curve and introduction of tools is done with there are very little objectives to give you direction. THE GOOD- Cities offer room for expansion- Beautifully detailed miniature village style looks- introduction and learning curve- Great tool designedTHE BAD- Lack of objectivesDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												Best sim city type game since Sim City 4 Rushhour,  without question.  Obviously that does not say much when you compare what has come out since SC4 but still it is a great game.  Roads that are curvable, the ability to make your own buildings (think BAT tool in SC4 but a ton easier to figure out and use), custom bus lines, custom train lines, custom subway lines, taxis, ferry service, expandable roads, click and follow cars/pedistrians ...It is not perfect mind you, the ability to bulldoze and flatten land does not exist (well it does on slopes with low % grades, but you want to flatten a mountain, that is not happening as no option to do it).Also, once you reach 8 expansions of your city limits that is it.  No option to buy land past that (at least that I have found).  That said 8 extensions is a lot but would be nice to build more.  Right now I have a city at 110K population though it has been there for a while.  Thing is there is a huge online community that has gives tons of FREE downloadable content which makes the game interesting.  Currently I am on 92 plus hours and still loving it.  Just downloaded the expansion AFTER DARK (that costs money in case you were wondering) but it gives more eye-candy and transport options.I currently give it an 8.5/10 which says a lot as it is rare I  ever give a game 8 or higher.

												Cities: Skylines experience in one word? Extraordinary.Cities: Skylines not only offers breath taking visuals, it also features captivating game play by implementing the most moddable options we've seen in a city sim to date. Without a doubt the asset editor is probably one of the most brilliant ideas included with this game. Ever play a city sim where some buildings are not to your liking, require too much space or you just don’t like the general set out of them? Not anymore, you can change absolutely everything to suit your preferences and gameplay style. Once you get taken into your citizen’s messages via chirper it is unbelievably easy to lose time whilst playing this game. I cannot tell you how much time I’ve spent re-routing traffic in order to get it working smoothly, so don’t be surprised if a quick fix for heavy traffic areas become a grand plan that takes more than the quick couple of minutes you had anticipated before starting. Cities: Skylines has completely revolutionised the whole genre of city sims. Keep in mind this is just the start of something great, I cannot wait to see what else can come of this genre after such a phenomenal milestone. 11/10 "

												You're into macro management more than micro management ?You're fed up of small maps ? (*winks at SimCity fail*)You just want to relax while watching your city grow on the plots you simply designed ?Then this game is for you ! A combination of the good parts of one city sim with another along with new features not yet made in any of those sim.The bad point ?- Localization suffers some typos/mistakes here and there, but it's still alright.- Tunnels can't be made ... A mod to fix that ? *winks at modders* - No building customization (giving it a continent style over another) ... Again, modders are there for that !The good point ?- Even after 4 hours, I still didn't fill the map and yet I could expand it more.- Easy to understand.- Traffic sim is quite alright, even though vehicles sometimes don't use all the road lanes for some reasons.- Limitation ? What's that ? You're limitless ! Even doing a highway across your city is possible if you wanted to. (Although I don't see the point of doing it ...)			"

												I can quite put my finger on why I do not recommend this game to be honest. I was so happy for this game that I preordered it and I downloaded it and played it as soon as it became available. After a bit of time setting up towns, parks, commercial buildings and industrial areas I started to get that feeling of repitition. I built my town and everything is running great, I build my wonder building and I have alot of folk coming into my town. All my buildings are upgraded and all of this I did within 3 hours of play time. I feel as if the developers mostly focused on the road and traffic aspect of the game. It doesn't really matter what you build or where you build it, as long as there is not traffic you're fine.The 1 and only reason I dont recommend this game is because it gets repetitive after a short time span. The game itself is beautiful, the fact that I can zoom in and see such great detail is the only reason why I still play every once in a while.5/10 GAME "

												TL;DR The game is a nice leveling sandbox hampered by unintuitive gameplay, unusual traffic decisions, limited building styles, and confusing UI decisions. The less micro you like in a game, the more you will like this one. If you don't like being on rails while you play and want to have fine tunning controls, this game is probably not for you.Edit: As of the most recent update, while many things have been improved, the core complaints below has not been addressed. I do hope they address at least some of this, but for now everything below is still accurate. I have also clarified the maximum zoning size.Unfortunately, I have to move this review to not recommending for now. Once the rose colored glasses come off, there are some major issues that need fixing before I recommend this game to anyone but the most forgiving of individuals. The game is pretty good and can be a lot of fun...but those who haven't bought it yet will probably be heavily annoyed by the many frustrations this game also provides. Issue #1 Traffic. People will tell you there is nothing wrong with traffic, but there really is, and I can explain that problem in a sentence. Cars are always moving. Car leaves origin, travels towards destination, returns to origin, and heads to destination again. Because of this loop always running, there is no way to fix the traffic problem. People, businesses, factories work on cycles in real life. What's more, they are not constantly productive. Some forms of agriculture produce goods daily, some weekly, some monthly, and some are a once a year thing. Major comercial sectors time their shipments to arrive at night when there is limited traffic and thus deliveries are more efficient. With no day/night cycle and thus no low traffic/heavy traffic cycles the game punishes otherwise efficient designs by having only one mode of traffic, heavy. This is what creates all of the other traffic problems observed. Sure you can build around these problems, and there are many people who gain great pleasure from dealing with such. If that is you, then this game is probably for you. Otherwise, there really needs to be cyclic traffic flows in this game. Low traffic weekends in industrial areas, high traffic commercial. Residential needs to be low traffic most of the day.Issue #2 Limitations. There is a lot missing from this game. Asthetics, public building options, utilities, even auto constructed building have very limited and generic asthetics. Because of this, you will quickly find that one city looks just like any other quickly leaving the game feeling very cookie cutter. Having multiple building styles that alternate every 10 years or so would go a long way to fixing this and creating a feeling of a progressing city. Mods can only help in a limited way here. This is a fix that really needs to come from the devs. Issue #3 Zoning. There is only one way this game zones, that is automatically as you lay your roads. You can color in the blocks representing what can be built, but no matter what, you can not define the shape of the area you want constructed in. This forces you away from more organic designs as the game attempts to create numerous obnoxious shapes when a simple rectangle would have done much better. Such choices are not in your hand, and there are no creative work arounds as zoning is immediatly deleted when you remove a road, and anything built on it. Even if you are just trying to fix something and all buildings would still be with road access where they need it. Fix, let the player zone an area as industrial, commercial, or industrial then let them build the roads afterwards. The game can then highlight areas wasted due to lack of road access. This would allow for more organic, fun designs. As the game currently exist, and as a reply to ""NGB"" the image below represents how it currently works.

			This image goes along with my review for Cities: Skylines. This was in response to an individual telling me I had missed certain UI elements. The inset explains everything else that requires explanation.		


Issue #4 Building Footprint Sizes. Thanks to the way the game is created, you will never have large flowing fields of green on the outskirts of your city. Every single building has a maximum size of 4X4. Yes there are limited buildings that are larger you can construct manually, but you will never see large areas develop on their own. This is a direct result of how zoning is handled. Fix for this, fix zoning, then let the building bases have larger sizes.Issue #5 The Fan Base. This is going to be the number 1 reason I am not going to recomend this game to most people. Currently, the fans are to put it mildly, hostile to any criticisms of the game. Collosal Order has made no mistake and can do no wrong, so any issues you see are your fault and that's all there is. This isn't a problem in itself, it's a problem because there are so many like this that people with real issues can't talk about them because these fans derail threads and stop any form of productive discussion on the proplems. This is a good game that needs work, it is not a priceless work of art that needs to be preserved in its release state. There absolutely are design decisions in this title that need to be reconsidered. When you have so many that attack those that would suggest this game needs more work you can't have the discussions that need to happen. What's more, it's hard to get help when the fans are so abusive. There are many aspects of this game that just are not intuitive, and there is a significant portion of this fan base that will leave you not even wanting to use the forums. This is the real shame of the success of this game. This game was almost too successful for its own good.Edit: A screenshot from the comments on this review which shows an example of the response criticism of this game recieves. Notice that no points are refutted or discussed, just a blanket everyone else thinks this game is wonderful. I think he may have also been trying to criticize me...but the jab seems to have gone over or under my head.

There are an abundance of places where you can read the virtues of this game. This is the devil advocate review that only focuses on the bad or at a minimum the questionably implemented features that detract from the experience. The bird is not an issue to make you not buy the game, however, you will be punished for modding it out by turning off achievments. While there is a mod to re-enable achievments, what will probably start nagging you is how you have to keep downloading mods to fix questionable design decisions. An ingame option to turn off all nag screens and the bird is not too much to ask. These are the basic things that serve to move this from a must have to a marginal recomendation depending on whether you can ignore the issues and are willing to work around the ones that can't be ignored. For me the answer is no, which is why I have stopped playing for now.I am aware that the devs have planned a number of improvements to the game, if any of those improvements affect the issues I have highlighted, I will gladdly return to fix this review and its recomendation status. While I have highlighted the fans as the #1 issue for me not recommending the game, it doesn't really factor in. I hope people that applies to read it and reply proving me right, even better, maybe they read it and realize they could be a little more civil to their fellow humans. Who knows? If any 2 of the above issues become resolved I will move this review to a solid recommend. If this game goes on sale for $15.00 dollars, then that is also a solid recommend from me even with the issues.			"

												It's a gorgeous game that's for sure, but it quickly gets ""samey"" and enevitably you end up playing traffic simulator 2016 trying to get the road network to work.  There is also very little actual management you can do.  You designate a zone and the game builds everything for you.  Sure you can adjust taxes and make bus/train/plane stations (again, traffic simulator) but it always feels like you're doing nothing for the city.  However, the aesthetic appeal and community mods do add some replayability.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend getting this game unless it's on sale.			"

												A really great city-builder with DLC that lacks focus.Addresses 90% of Simcity 2013s stink-lines: Larger areas, editing maps, abstract-enough agents to allow large scale simulation, and moddingThe music and overall aesthetic isn't as good though. However, it's very servicable!			"

												If you enjoy building cities and road systems, you will enjoy this game. It's kind of difficult at first, and you'll be re-creating a city all the time, because you learned a new skill to make your city better, but over time, it'll be worth it, and you'll make a city of your dream. Use mods, they make the experience that much better!This game is cool...			"

												Finally a game that can rival SimCity 4! Or so I thought. While there is a lot to like here I have some long standing frustrations that still haven't been fully dealt with. The largest by far is the traffic. For goodness sake use ALL the lanes! I'm tired of seeing a huge line of cars in the right lane of a 6 lane road and all of them are going straight. The AI needs a much better system to deciding where the cars should be. This might seem a minor issue (and it was for the most part in SimCity 4), but in Cities Skylines having cars stuck in traffic has a huge negative impact on your service trucks. Very quickly you have the dead overwhelming areas because the traffic is stacked up in one lane. It's irritating and I find myself really only playing the game in bursts. Usually after a new DLC or patch comes out in hopes the various minor things are fixed.Bottom line though... it's really the only strong city builder out there. Its performance exceeds that of Cities XL and XXL and EA just ruined SimCity.			"

												It's good but it's not perfect. What this game is lacking is some kind of polishing of the underlying game mechanics. It is more of a citypainter than a citybuilder. On normal mode the game is way to easy and the only challenge is to manage the traffic, which has some flaws though. However you can fix it with mods(if they get updated) but you need a very powerful pc if you want to build a large city.Nevertheless this game can provide a lot of fun and you are doing nothing wrong by spending some money on it.
