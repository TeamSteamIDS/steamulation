Early Access Review
								Here we go;Bad SimulationBad FramerateBad GraphicsBad Communication from the DeveloperPoor future planPoor bug fixesPoor codingPoor attempt at pleasing everyonePoor attempt at keeping what an RCT game even isPoor Game life it's had due to having 3 seperate developers.Overall i wouldnt recommend this to anyone. If this changes in the future than fair enough but as it stands now its is not a full product. Releasing this product as a full game is ridiculous and i wouldnt be surprised if Trading Standards in the UK fined the publisher and/or Steam removes it from its services. The game did not live up to anything originally promised along with the fact that it has had basically no optimization done too it throughout the entire time of it being in Alpha. Not only that but releasing this a day before its competitors when its no where near feeling like a full game just goes to show how much of a waste, scam and poor attempt at trying to make your own market with an already estabilshed franchise went for this publisher/developer.

Early Access Review
								Honest review incoming if you want seriousness.I really wanted to give it a thumbs up...The game is enjoyable, not great... but enjoyable. Unfortunately, yes there a ton of issues which are making it feel hardly worth 20$ even. They give you a warning that says it's early access and to expect some issues, but there's more than ""some"" if you will. I'll break down some basic pros and cons (I have not played RCT3, my last was RCT2 if that helps judge any of you guys looking to possibly jump back into this franchise.)Pros:- You still get to make a theme park and make rollercoasters.- Menus seem pretty clean and pretty easily navigated.- Some of the customizable options for paths and such are cool.- Probably couldn't be stated enough, the spline with coasters has so much potential and upside if it works, but still seems a bit too frustrating at the moment.- UGC could make this insanely awesome once implemented.Cons: (Yes, there's quite a lot, but it's just things I honestly think they could improve on and make this game much much better.)- Lag... This is arguably one of the most frustrating issues noted. Switching around in the menus seems to just not sit right at all with the game. There's so many points in the game that lag becomes an issue that as much as I'm trying to ACTUALLY play the game with a positive outlook, I physically can't...- Very minimal customization options. (Mostly scenery things, but a few others)- Path creation is quite annoying, putting a stand or booth down or whatever non-ride hut you put down.. if it doesn't form a line you should have the option to automatically have it connect to the path at the easiest and shortest route. Creating a super small path 1 inch away from the building and not being able to connect it gets very frustrating. (I'm sure they already know this.)- Coaster creation again. I can't even make a basic loop on a coaster anymore. Some of the prebuilt pieces offer some neat designs/ideas but they ultimately feel kind of lame. I figured they'd have an option to add a ""loop"" and then you can choose the metrics on it.. but you have to do some funky spline work that right when you think it looks good and you budge just a hair, the whole piece you just spent messing with is all messed up. Adding a straight track with spline feels ridiculously hard when it shouldn't be.. They need to have some snap options or something to help the building process of coasters. Simplicity honestly goes so far if it works (which I know it has in previous games). Honestly, I could explain so much more.. but I'm just assuming they're working on trying to fix the relatively poor custom coaster design process. Such a good concept so poorly executed. :(- Pre-made coasters feel half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that's being generous..... Not even going to get into that.- Not sure the bigger park staff huts works any better. (I could just be confused one how it works..?) I had a small mechanic hut near some rides with 1 employee, switched it to 3 and it felt HARDLY any better to fixing the rides. I finally get to the bigger mechanic building, employee 10, and I literally feel like it's producing 0 work. It'll have like 1 ride repaired when 5+ are broken down right next to it. Not sure again if I'm dumb or if that's just not working. Eventually rides get fixed, but it takes much longer than I think it's supposed to be.- Campaign has some very bad issues. If you want someone who hasn't played your game before to really get into it, you have to give some better direction and descriptions. ie... you don't get all coaster style options right away, you should be able to highlight over the items you don't have and it tells you how to obtain them. One of the biggest issues, though, is the freezing/""GG games over"" pretty much after you get so far. My buddy and I both bought 2 expansions of land to our parks and that seems to be the sweet spot that you have permanent game issues. His saved game in campaign no longer loads, and mine takes about 3-4 minutes to load my park and then another 2-3 to become functional as the screen is froze trying to load it. (I have a very good computer and internet connection, as does he). Once I finally get in, it's just consant issues, to the point I can't play the game.- Deleting is a nightmare. If you ever get that feeling in your stomach trying to do something super simple but it's beyond frustrating... prepare to get that feeling.. a lot. You give the delete a bulldozer emblem... make it a bulldozer, let us just cruise over those trees and bushes with ease... Obviously we want confirmations on deleting our rides and such.. but don't make it take 40 minutes trying to clear some land.- I actually tried the music for some of the rides. C'mon...TL:DR review, should you buy?I want to say yes.. buy, but I don't feel comfortable doing that. The game has SO much potential.. it's 2016, right? It has a lot of issues, and if they're open to ACTUALLY reading reviews, I think they can knock this game out of the park.Unfortunately, everyone knows a game is defined by it's launch (sad but true). And this one failed pretty hard. It's labeled early access, but I've played much less developed games in early access that ran better.BUT!!!! Don't give up on this game. Give them some time, enjoy older RCT games. Companies typically respond pretty well to issues, we'll assume they'll do the same. I'll continue to attempt to play the game and keep up with some updates, but for anyone looking to invest... wishlist it and let the game get to at least a playable state. "

Early Access Review
								Rollercoaster Tycoon is an important game for me. It is that game what I install everytime something bad happened, when I'm ill or when I want to destress. Install RCT 1, 2 or 3 and you have a smile on your face in a minute I can guarantee you.The game has it's own character. The colors, the happy peeps, balloons and the cartoony artstyle without being a casual game at all is proven a strong a concept and I think after many years this game is still a lot's of gamers favorite. It was RCT that I saw on friends PC's screens, even on them who never play any other video game.RCT World fails in every aspect to reproduce the freedom and creativity and addictive feeling of the older RCT games.Even when the game did not suffered from technical bugs, 3D glitches, broken sound/music, bad optimization and way too less content it was a bad game. It's missing spirit, comedy, freedom and everything what makes the RCT series great.The peeps are boring to look at. They don't have any style themself. It seems the dev team could not choose between realistic and cartoony and choose to design a mix of photorealistic characters with cartoony movement models. Everything moves too fast even on slow setting on a slow engine. I did met the sys req. for the game (the minimum) but whatever graphic setting I use after I place my first rollercoaster the game can't deliver anymore.Object placement and path placement is ridiculous. The terrain tools very user unfriendly. You can't place path where you want, even if it seems to fit perfectly the engine don't allow you to place anything on random places. Tools you have like a grid and a snap grid makes this even more worse.You can only place objects directly to the ground. You cannot place anything on top of something else. You can't even place banks, lights, carbage bins anymore on paths when the path is higher then the ground level. You can not build anything anymore in the game itself. (It's advertised that you can build anything in any other 3D tool and import it).There is almost non to zero customization. You can't choose the main building, the entrance building, thematic entrances, place of entrances etc etc. It's all setup for you so the only thing you can do is build a prefab item. No creative building anymore.You can't assign staff, can't train staff, can't change the colors of them. It's all setup. Same for food stalls, ticket stalls, peeps etc etc.The management tools are not complete. The menu to read info about your parc is very hard to read. It's just a plain spreadsheet directly imported from the engine to the game. No nice menu's, no humor, no cartoony style and just a plain and simple click and place building game with a tycoon parc theme around it.Last but not least the amount of content you get at the moment is 1/30 part of the original RCT games. You have 6 rollercoasters to choose from, 4 different terrain types (instead of 18 in RCT 3), a few thrill and a few junior and family rides. All rides are fixed and you cannot change anything yourself. But even if you could the amount of content provided by the game itself is so minimum. You can choose between some rocks and some trees and a handfull of decoration pieces. Theme parc building should be something that makes you happy and should be happened smooth and relax. This game is slow, frustrating, ugly and simply misses anything that could make a game like this fun.			"

								Buy Planet Coaster instead. This game is a buggy, laggy cash grab defacing the Roller Coaster Tycoon name. Planet coaster is developed by Frontier, the original developers of Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 and they are doing an excellent job. If you don't believe me there are plenty of lets plays and player made videos of the betas that look far and away better than this game ever will.			"

Early Access Review
								Most of the positive reviews of this game are getting down voted out of existence, so I am going to try and be as fair as possible.  Most of the negativity surrounding this game is based on how overwhelmingly buggy it is right now.  That is 100% true.  But it’s still an awesome game.        I can already feel all those negative fingers twitching over their keyboards waiting to drown me in hateful comments, but let me explain my reasoning first.  I agree: THE BUGS ARE EVERYWHERE.  Early access may even be a little misleading in this one.  When I hear early access, the first thing that comes to my mind is one of those new indie games that’s totally functional, but needs a lot more content.  This is not that.  This is early early access… This game is Super ****ing Mega early access.  We are basically alpha testing this bad boy.  If you are not willing to occasionally fight through bugs or lose a coaster once or twice, don’t buy this game.  The fact that they are still charging full price for something so incomplete is my biggest issue with the game right now.  Almost every aspect of this game has at least one significant issue that needs to be worked out.        However, I ended up giving this a thumbs up because all of the problems are seem to be superficial.  When they are fixed, I am 100% sure this game will be fantastic.  All the bugs, such as, the faulty AI, the wonky EID ratings (excitement/intensity/nausea), the path placing issues, etc. that everybody is complaining about are all very fixable.  I have played many games (early access or otherwise) that were just inherently bad.  Bad concept, bad controls,  un-navigateable menus, bad whatever…  But keep in mind, this game is Super ****ing Mega early access, and the core of the game, the most important part, is rock solid.       And what is the core?  To me, the most important part of any theme park simulator is the coaster editor itself.  I have seen many negative reviews claiming that this one is over complicated and hard to use.  I struggle to even wrap my head around these claims.  When I first started playing this, before reading a single review, my first thought was, “Man, this coaster editor is ****ing amazing! It’s so easy to use!”  I hate to step on people’s toes, so I’ll stomp them instead.  If you put any actual effort into figuring out how to use to use the editor instead of giving up after 5 minutes, anyone in their right mind would be forced to agree that this is by far the most elegant and free form coaster editor yet.  There are practically no limits to what you can do.  Besides, even if the node editor somehow isn’t for you, the prefab piece editor is still present and works just fine.  Although I encourage you to take all other complaints and reviews you read seriously, it is important to me that everyone laugh in the face of any person that says the coaster editor is hard to use ;).  Kidding…  By the way.  But, seriously the coaster editor is awesome.	Since the other reviewers have so completely covered the specifics of the many bugs, I don’t feel compelled to cover them in my review.  In any case, I am confident that given time, they will all be fixed.CONCLUSION	This game is not even close to being done and full price is fairly unreasonable.  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT SOMETHING FULLY FUNCTIONAL.  Give it more time, it’ll get there.  But if you’re like me and you get a kick out of seeing a game in its early stages and watch it fill in, give it a go.  If you want to give a game a negative review because its buggy while in early access, maybe don’t buy early access games in the future…  You clearly don’t appreciate the development process.  (people complaining about the bugginess to price ratio excluded)			"

Early Access Review
								This game is awful - strike it off your wishlist. Dev's say it's ""over 50% complete"", but IMO that statement is crap and they know it. Atari's community management staff also need a lesson in etiquette and accepting popular opinion (more on that below).To start with the game briefly, it's not even close to 10% of what RCT3 already gives us. Yeah, I can hear the fanboys screaming ""oh, but geek - it's early access"" - and it is - but nothing has improved since that original alpha. I stream this for just 2 hours’ yesterday, and despite the graphics and textures looking like something from 1995 (even on highest settings), FPS barely struggled to nudge far past 50 on a system with an i7-4790K and SLI GTX 970's. Peeps were also blurry up close, or moonwalked/stutter across the map if you zoom out to far. Foliage and other assets were pixelated (trees actually look like Minecraft) up close, and often just disappeared randomly for no reason. Staff also don’t work and scale of buildings is way off. A drinks stall is larger than the carousel for example. Don’t even get me started on the apparently fixed coaster builder. There's no banked corner pieces of track in any rides for a start, and motion paths look very rigid for the coasters. It doesn’t look natural. Then there's Atari's community management. Want to make a thread saying the game is not great? It gets deleted. Make the thread again, you get perm-banned from their site. Mention Planet Coaster on their Twitch and YouTube streams/channel, get purged buddy. Go look at the forums on their official site - it's all full of praise and users defending the title. If they perhaps put as much effort as they do in moderation into the game itself, it wold probably be a lot better.Save your money, buy Planet Coaster or just hold off on this until it's finished (if that ever happens). There's a very, very long way to go and they have no money. How do you think this game will turn out? I have a rough idea...			"

												Don't get this game. This game is NOT made by the original creators of the RCT franchise. It's made by some no-name dev studio that's still trying to figure out the RCT vibe.UI is trash, its full of bugs, it doesn't offer much customizability outside of the realm of the old game (RCT3) released in 2004, it runs like a pile of crap (you need a monster machine to get any kind of useable framerate. I'm on a gtx 1060/i5 4670k and I can't push 30 @ Medium settings).One of the major downfalls of the game is that it relies too much on the Steam Workshop and User-Generated Content (UGC) to support the game. If the devs would actually bother working on some of the rides in the game, they might have a game worth $30. But at the $50 pricepoint that they're asking for, you'd be better off flushing the money down your toilet. At least you'd get a little entertainment out of watching it swirl down the toiletbowl.The game is absolutely not worth the money you'll end up paying for it. If you want a *real* RCT-style experience, go with PlanetCoaster. It's cheaper, and infinitely better. AND it's made by the same guys that made the other RCT games! Why are you still here reading this?! Go buy PlanetCoaster!TL;DR: Don't buy this game. It's trash compared to PlanetCoaster.EDIT: The price has been reduced from $50 to $35 since the initial creation of this review. It is *still not worth it*, go pay the extra $10 and get a good game that's actually worth your money!			"

Since its early access release, the game has improved a lot. However this is not enough yet and I still cannot recommend this game in its current state. You will be better of playing RCT3 or Planet Coaster.  Yes, the game is finally playable and you can indeed have some fun in simply slamming rides down and charging people. However, the more you play the more annoyances pop up. Luckily for you, I made a list:Lets start with the positive:+ Huge improvements made since the first early access build+ I like the floating smileys above the visitors heads that tell you if they need something, shows what is needed very clearly.+ Quick and responsive UI and placement of paths and path scenery (These were my biggest annoyances last time.)+ Good framerate, maxed out on a GTX 1080 always 100 fps or higher.+ The physical water simulation is nice.The unsure points:~ Graphics have improved a lot, but compared to Planet Coaster they aren't great either.~ The guests have transformed from zombies to real people, but still aren't anywhere near the level of Planet Coaster.~ Famous people visit your park with twitter like #responses~ Rides and scenery can be unlocked by spending tycoon points. These points are earned by completing special and usually easy challenges. However if you just complete your challenges there is nothing to unlock very quickly since you simply earn too much points. This makes it a useless feature.The bad:- Famous people dab if you please them......... something that will only be funny for a month or so...- Mission objectives don't check the state of the park if you place an objective item before the missions opens. So you build a mechanic stall and afterwards a mission tells you to build a mechanic stall. Then you have to build a new one since it doesn't recognize the first.- Physical water moves way too fast- Camera height is based on terrain height, so if you have a steep valley and your camera middlepoint moves through the valley, the camera will lower significantly even though you were just scrolling through the map.- Many problems with terrain covering paths- You cannot delete scenery when building, you have to use the delete tool which is annoying.- Why can paths be curved, but queue's not???- No freedom in ride entrance/exit.The very bad:-- Many simulation problems, namely:---- A notification tells me: ""Congrats, Twister 1 is very popular"", so I check the ride which tells me: ""Total customers: 1""....---- Mission: ""achieve park beauty level 100"" -> place 7 very misplaced flower beds and mission accomplished..---- Max people in the park seems to be limited to your 'fame level' which rises when you please a famous person. Too bad they only visit like once a year. So if you have a great park but don't have any guests you simply have to wait and lose money until a famous person turns up allowing you to have more guests in your park at once.---- Closes coaster that was open, cannot reopen coaster since I do not have the money to purchase the coaster?!?---- Famous person comes with 'family' says the message. In the end she comes alone and doesn't even want to pay 2 euros for a ride and rages... Time to fast forward to the next famous person to come in...-- Cannot combine scenery, only special piece by piece stuff can be combined. For example, topiaries cannot be used to make a large flower bed.-- The music, the game only has one song in 6 variations which are not that great either.....-- Zoomed out guests seem to move with 1fps while the game runs at 140 fps...-- Had many crashes and freezes of the game or/and my pc with this game. Could be related to my overclocks but I don't have any problems with other games.Original review 31-3-2016:Please people, do not buy this game in its current state! The first release was a buggy beta, okay, no problem just fix the annoyances it before going public. Then they extended the releasedate with 3 months. Great! I hope the game will benefit.  But nope, almost all of the complaints made with the pretty unplayable beta 5 months ago still remain in the game. And if a developer does not fix the main problems in the game within 5 months I lose my trust in this game becoming anything great. I tried to like it,  I really tried, but its clunky controls and camera ruined it all, just like in the beta.I had such high hopes, especially with the extended release date and the great competition that is Planet Coaster and Parkitect. I hoped that they would learn from those games and see how it should have been done. But no, the controls are still clunky, the game still sound terrible and  the worst is that most anoyances like fence placement still hasn't been fixed. It's not that they didn't do anything these months, they implemented the peeps, more rides, a piece by piece coaster builder, a strange campaign and graphics options. But no fixing the main problems...So in short, if you want to play a new game like Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, buy Planet Coaster which is in early alpha right now on their website and if you want to play a game like RCT1/RCT2 buy Parkitect which is also in early alpha and should arrive at steam in a few months. But please don't be as stupid as me, please don't buy this game in its current state. I really hope they can turn the sinking ship around and still make a great game of it after Early access.			"

Early Access Review
								While Planet coaster is vastly superior in terms of graphics, object placement, freeform coaster building, ride and peep animations, terrain, bugs/crashes, and a charming atmosphere even at its alpha stage, we still have to wait until the end of the year for a game with any sense of challenge or park management. In the meantime we have to hope that RCTW improves to satisfy our park management cravings while we wait.These pros and cons are against other major FINISHED park management games like RCT 1, 2 and 3.PROS (THINGS THAT ARE BETTER THAN THEY WERE 12 YEARS AGO):-There are curved paths.-You can build a truly freeform coaster if you have the patience of a saint.-The water dynamics are so impressive that I assume that they were already part of the Unity Engine and not the RCTW developers.-There is a car park at the entrance. I like thisCONS (THINGS THAT ARE WORSE THAN THEY WERE 12 YEARS AGO):  GRAPHICS AND UI-If there were no curved paths in this game, it would almost be GRAPHICALLY IDENTICAL to RCT3 (2004!)- I get memory leaks where the game eats up to 26GB of my RAM. I am guessing not all players have 32GB ram to deal with this issue! -The interface looks VERY bland. I am not asking for candy crush but I’ve seen accounting software that looks more exciting than this.PERFORMANCE ISSUES -My FPS is actually fine for the first 1000 peeps on max graphics. As soon as I get over 1500 peeps (easily achievable with 2 of the 9 park tiles), my game becomes unusable. The game freezes for 5 seconds every 30 seconds, crashes around every 15 minutes, and takes over 2 minutes to save the game (no joke).(I have i7 3930K, GTX 970, 32GB RAM, SSD)-Once my park starts to be a decent size (3 tiles or 2000 peeps) the game can no longer save or open it without freezing. -I have not heard anyone with over 2000 peeps in their park claim that it is running smoothly.How can I be motivated to spend time building something that I can no longer use once it starts to get interesting?  PATHS-Building paths can be a pain when connecting to other paths or building up or near hills. -Changing the path material means destroying anything connected to those paths (LIKE SHOPS) as the game will not allow you to place the path directly next to them again.   To fix: Add a material paint brush tool in the path menu and avoid the issue altogether.-The game is SO PICKY when it comes to snapping benches, bins and shops to paths. They won't snap to positions that look perfectly acceptable and by default they seem to want to snap off the path onto the grass.    To fix: Allow intersecting geometry and free placement of path scenery and allow shops to be freely placed much closer to the paths. Let your users judge what is intersecting and what looks good for them.  PEEPS & STAFF-The peeps animations are very wooden and they don't walk as families or groups like they did 12 years ago.-Peeps sometimes stop walking in queue lines and hold up the entire queue for a few minutes.-From birds-eye level the peeps stutter around the park at 2fps-Sometimes all the peeps in the park disappear all at once and gradually start spilling in through the entrance.-Staff are often seen sliding around the park without moving their legs like ghosts.-Staff are often seen walking adjacent to the paths, phasing through all the scenery like ghosts.-Mechanics are often seen congregating at ride exits, phasing through each other like ghosts.I am pretty sure the staff are ghosts.  RIDES-THERE ARE NO LOG FLUMES-THERE ARE NO TRANSPORT RIDES, how hard can it be?-While you can build rollercoasters piece-by-piece like you could in RCT3, parts like helix sections, loops and barrel rolls are missing. -Coasters built or edited with freeform tools lead to a very un-smooth ride when finished. Something as simple as a descending helix can be a nightmare to build smoothly. -Adding a lift-chain is way harder than it needs to be.-It is not yet possible to change the colours of shops and non-coaster rides. -The pre-built coaster stations are much larger and more realistic than RCT3 but you cannot choose where to put the entrance and exits.-Tweaking an existing coaster can be dangerous. Clicking on a section of track to make a banked curve sometimes causes the camera to move which causes that piece of track to move way out of place. You then have to spend ages putting it back into place to avoid an unwelcome s-bend in your coaster. To fix: GIVE US AN UNDO OPTION! Alternatively, allow us to lock certain axis’ when needed.-Deleting parts of a coaster can be very tiresome after it has been built. -Building pre-built coasters from the menu is an absolute nightmare in any park that is not perfectly flat and barren.To fix: Give us an option to snap lowest part to terrain height and automatically bulldoze any scenery that would get in the way. At the very least allow us to see the ride supports during placement so we can see how ridiculously high off the ground the base of the coaster is going to be.-Pre-built coasters do not display any excitement/nausea stats.-All my coasters have ridiculously high nausea ratings while I think it looks quite safe.    To fix: allow us to see that nausea heatmap on our ride while we are building it if we want. At the very least, give the guests time to visit a toilet at the ride exit before puking everywhere. There are never any staff nearby to mop it all up.   TERRAIN-Adjusting terrain under rides or roller-coaster supports is totally forbidden-There are very few terrain materials available. This is like an hour’s job for a texture artist.-There are no waterfalls like there were 12 years ago-You cannot build tunnels like you could 12 years ago  SCENERY-No building blocks/wall sections like in RCT2&3. I don’t want to have to trust an amateur Maya modeller for well-optimised and decent looking models without ridiculous stats from the steam workshop every time I want to build architecture. I want to design things myself. Look at what planet coaster lets you do!-Selecting scenery items freezes the game for up to 5 seconds each, and occasionally CRASHES THE GAME ENTIRELY   To fix: if you don’t have budget to optimise your game any further, at least allow autosave.If you can bear these problems for a few hours, zoom out and look at your park from above with all of its curvy paths and freeform coasters it can actually look quite realistic. The fully working park management aspect is a fun challenge and is just as addictive as the original games.Since no other title can claim both of these points at the same time yet, yes I would recommend this game to keep you busy until Planet Coaster comes out at the end of the year, after which, you will probably never touch this game again.However, as I am unable to open saved parks (loading screen crash)  and experience memory leaks after they start to get big I cannot yet recommend this game.

Early Access Review
								Started with the open sandbox. Quite enjoyed it. There were a lot of bugs and glitches, but no dealbreakers as it's still early access.But when I started a scenario and looked at the way those parks are built: horrible. Seriously, who builts a park like that?!The coaster builder really needs some work. When I build a coaster over water, it crashes. When I try to make a coaster as realistic as possible, it crashes for unknown (probably ridiculous) reasons. The prebuilt coasters are built really bad and therefore should definitely crash, but they don't... They really look like a 2 year old designed them.Other problems I encountered:- Peeps couldn't enter a coaster, the entrance was properly built but it seemed like there was an invisable barrier.- You can only adjust the direction by 5 degrees when building a coaster. Normally this wouldn't be a problem for me, but sometimes it gets stuck at (for example) 42 degrees when you need 40 degrees, so you get ugly wobbles in your coaster.- Coasterphysics when it comes to speed: it just keeps going... really could use some more loss of speed over the course- The breaks on the coaster builder don't make sense: you can't fine tune them at all, and are almost impossible to use midcourse- Result of the break issue: running more than 2 trains is almost impossible- The image rocks a lot sideways when riding a coaster-  Paths are difficult to build: when you want to connect two paths, it restricts you in only a few possibilities.- The game randomly crashes: so be sure to save your progress often!- Peeps keep walking around hungry, even though I placed an abundant amount of foodstalls/restaurantsThis list could go on a while.For now, I wouldn't recommend this game, as it's not worth the price.I really hope these problems are gonne be resolved. I know it's still early access, but there are so many problems which make me question if it will be fixable.			"

								I REALLY, REALLY wanted to give this game a good review. But, I can't. Even after reading all of the negative reviews, I still couldn't believe that RCT would be a bad buy. However, it was.The graphics are pretty good. There is room for some improvement, but over all, good graphics.This is where positive remarks come to an end. You can't build buildings. You can't make your own pavillions or themes. I miss that. The path system is pretty clunky. You sometimes can't connect to specific places. No tunnels. Want your roller coaster to go through a mountain? You can't.It just feels like this game is trying to be to slick. With that, it fails.			"

												!!BEFORE YOU BUY!!You should be aware that this is not the only RollerCoaster/Amusment park Simulation available at this time. Planet Coaster is another game in direct competition with Roller Coaster Tycoon World. I've played the early access versions of both games  and based on my experiences I feel that Planet Coaster is a more polished and ready for release then RCTW. Because I have not had significant time playing full builds of both games this is not a full review.  I simply want to help alert buyers of options before they buy this product based on the Roller Coaster Tycoon name. Prospective buyers should research both games and make decisions based on their own opinons and findings. To anyone confused I hope this helps.			"

								As a fan of the Rollercoaster Tycoon series after 11 years since the last installment this was absoluetly heartbreaking. The peeps don't look as what would be expected, the realistic coaster supports are just never there with any of the games in the series unless modded in. The limitations in the options menu is saddening. Seeing the difference between Planet Coaster and RCTW; RCTW isn't the same and its missing quite a lot for what this game use to be. As a fan i'm heartbroken to even suggest to anyone who could be a fan as well. I'm giving it a chance and hopefully the developers will listen to its fans who have patiently been waiting for years for the next installment and make this series worth playing again. Its gameplay has some good ideas within the game, but it greatly needs improvement. I'm giving this game a 6/10 in my opinion. It has a long way to go.			"

												I would have to say that the series has been my absolute favorite series I have every played EXCEPT for this game.This game I bought early with the expectation that it would live up to all of its predicessors and introduce modern hardware to the mix. It scrapes by as a very eh game.The good:* The rollercoaster editor is actually pretty great if you come from an art background and know how to use splines.* The graphics look pretty good.The bad:* The graphics settings are horribly broken on my system (dual monitor).  * The game fullscreens on a monitor that does 1080 but limits the resolution to the max of my other monitor which is a different aspect ratio so it looks terrible. There is no apparent way to override which monitor it chooses for fullscreen.* There aren't many rides and now with the story mode released it feels like a free to play game where you get internal game money from playing and completing objectives, you then spend that money on rides, attractions, and scenery. I just want to build my parks up like I want without the distraction of dealing with this overarching store. (This is just my nitpick and person preference, some may actually enjoy this)* The ""story"" thus far feels overpowering to the actual fun of running a park. Instead the whole thing is playing out like a tutorial of how to do every little thing in the game even though I figured it all out in early access and there is no way to skip or rush through it, you have to tediously do it all.My advice: This game is absolutely not worth $35. If you are paying it thinking its going to the same creators of the previous games, that is also not correct. The original creators don't even agree with this games current ownership. Frontier created the last game and did a great job in my opinion. Since then they have created planet coaster which looks pretty great, I believe I will be moving over to that game instead.			"

Early Access Review
								Time for an honest review. Normally I would not have recommended this game when it first released, but over the past 2 weeks the game has been updated with bug fixes and optimization that has steadily improved the experience. The fact is that this game has a solid base to build off of, and that is what people need to take away from it. I own both Planet Coaster and RCTW, both are hardly finished and both, in my opinion, have a positive future ahead of them. Also, Hats off to Nvizzio for keeping in touch with the community and rolling out updates as quickly as they can. With all of that said, I'll list my pro and cons.Pros-Coaster editor/maker in this game is EXCELLENT, Sure its a bit finnicky sometimes, but it's damn good and can only get better, I prefer it to the piece by piece editor in PC, it's one thing I hated about RCT3. -Decent variety of scenery to start and I'm sure this will be expanded upon-Solid amount of flat ride content with a new one coming every 2 weeks in Major patches (Yes, I believe them, they have stuck to that schedule so far)-I'll probably be crucified for this, but after the latest update..graphics have improved markedly, and I'd expect that to continue-The Management aspect is there, could be better but it's decent for EA.-Terrain tools are easy to use and effective, need an option for underground building though.-There is more but I'll leave it at that for now, new update is scheduled to be rolled out Tuesday or Wednesday next week so I'll edit this review at that timeCons-Peeps need work (Animations/texture/etc)-Optimization at this point is a bit shaky, people across a wide array of system are getting mixed results, once the park gets large it really starts to slow down, apparently this is getting addressed in next patch, I'll update if that is the case-Pathing is shoddy at the moment.-AI behavior is pretty poor in the current build, mechanics don't always fix rides, janitors are slow, etc.-Water quality sucks. lol.-Can't change ingame graphics while in your park. (Seriously guys?)-Can't place scenery on elevated paths (Again, really guys?)-Coaster ratings need work, every coaster I make is a vomit comet-General bugs and such-Overall, I'd recommend this based on the rate it is improving and the committment Nvizzio has shown to the franchise. I'd expect good things as time goes on.			"

												This game is abysmal. I'm a life-long fan of the RCT series and RCT:World has♥♥♥♥♥♥on them all from a height before promptly walking off laughing into the sunset with one finger raised. Getting it working? A challenge. It doesn't like doing simple things such as loading, or playing for long durations without a crash.Once you get it working, it's riddled with bugs and has captured next to nothing from the original games. It's clunky, riddled with UX screwups such as only being able to place fence panels one at a time, ah you know what? I can't be bothered with this review. The game's shocking, DO NOT WASTE £30.00 ON IT.If you want RCT:World, buy Planet Coaster - one of RCT's original teams have built it and it's highly rated. If you want a classic feel, try Parkitect. Save your sanity and money, U-turn here. I will never buy another Atari release after this complete scam they call a game. Just another early-access money grab.			"

Buy Planet Coaster....it's leaps and bounds better.UI is hideous and overwhelming.Controls are annoying.Music is horrible.Gameplay is boring.AI is ridiculously simple. Customers all pretty much just say the same thing.Roller coaster Building tools are just annoying and difficult to work with.Unlocking items with earned points is just stupid, why not just offer everything.NO FILTER FOR SCENERY OBJECTS????

								I tried to give this game a legitamte go. Go in with an unbias take on the game.Yes, this is Early Access, but nothing in this game feels like it will be special when it's done. It's essentially a worse version of RCT3 without a grid system. It's also much more awkward to work with than RCT3.Planet Coaster is the way to go with this generation of theme park games, it doesn't have everything yet, much like this game, but what it does have is stunning. It looks beautiful, it runs beautifully and it has a clear vision.Please avoid this game.			"

												Pre-ordered this one on the reputation of it's earlier series that I had a ton of fun with... Was accepting of the bugs during the beta.But this game is now live.  During the tutorials I had it crash twice on my high end system running at normal levels.Went to sandbox mode, more bugs in the camera as I could not unlock my view from a peep that had left the park.  After I figured out a work around 10 mins later the game crashed as I was waiting for a special peep to get to the park so I was doing nothing special.  Time in this game reflects the time I spent playing the beta with a few mins of crashing after the game went live.Do not purchase this game...  Even if they publish bugfixes I would no longer trust the makers.I would not recommend this game that I had high hopes for.  look for Planet Coaster as an option.			"

												I don't write many reviews, but after playing this game for the past few months I have to say I am sorely disappointed. It wasn't until after I purchased The Early release of this game did I learn that Frontier had nothing to do with this and that Planet Coaster was more of the successor to RCT3 than thos game. I came back periodically to see if game play had gotten any better, and while certain aspects did improve, overall it was a very BLAH experience. I really wanted to like this game but sadly the developers could not pull it itogether. I finally broke down and bought Planet Coaster today and I am totally convinced that Atari made a huge mistake in not keeping Frontier on as a developer. PC is BY FAR the better game in every aspect.			"

								I'll make this quick.  Here's a list of Pro's and Con's:Cons:No walls to build structures with.Poor range of textures to paint the terrain with.Cannot create tunnels for rides, paths and queuesCan't change the look of the stationsCan't change the look of the park gatesDecor offering only consists of 1 lamp post and 5 candy canes!Only 5 Facades!No smaller parts to create our own centre pieces with (ie. a large rock skull). Instead there are just large pre-made centre pieces to use.Again, no smaller parts to create our own specialty pieces. Just pre-made ones to use.Coasters cam is not smooth and feels jerky around corners. (no I don't mean frame rate)Coaster building can be irritatingly fiddly at times.The delete tool is terrible, you can only delete one item at a time.Removing small bushes is really difficult.Small choice of coasters.Not a massive graphical leap forward since RCT3.Some texures look shocking close upCrashed a few times when placing paths (but this is an early access game).Other than the coaster builder (spline) there are no improvements over the RCT3.Pro'sCoaster builder (spline based) could be great if the mechanics are ironed out.Looks visually better than the video that was released a year or so ago.Shops are okay.Summary.Don't waste your money on this just yet, hold off for 6 months in the hope they add loads more items to play with. It's a very steep price to pay for a game that feels like it's still in alpha. It's not a complete broken mess as some other reviews suggest, it's just got very little content to keep you interested for more than 4-5 hours. My general feeling is that the developers are completely missing the point of what people want out of a theme park simulator - it's like they've sucked all the fun out of the game by taking away the creative freedom of themeing a park. By themeing I mean creating something from scratch, not simply placing two pre-made centre pieces side by side! My main gripe with it is that it's doing anything to build on RCT3 - even if they add lots more content, it will only be on par with the previous game in the series.  "

								Gave this game a fair shot with over 20 hours played, but honestly, it's just terrible. The new PbP builder is ok if you can get used to the clunky control system, the trouble is the rest of the game is dire. It feels pointless spending time making nice looking buildings only for horrible looking peeps to walk through and micturate on the foundations of the building you spent hours fighting the game to make. Outside of the PbP builder the rest of the game is a rotten cabbage. The peeps roam around aimlessly in an eternal hunt for food stopping only briefly to hate your rides and urinate on your pathways. The coasters look, feel and sound weird (that is of course when they're actually working, which is rare). The staff management system involves you peppering the park with terrible eye sore buildings for each service which spawns a selected amount of staff that’ll walk around at running speed being completely useless. The entertainers are as about as entertaining as a hemeriod and look absolutely terrible. Overall the game just looks and feels rubbish even when you take into account the fact it’s an early access title. You might be tempted to give them the benefit of the doubt because this is early access and could be improved at some point to which I’d advise you exercise caution. They’re wasting time adding features like the PbP builder rather than focusing on improving the core game first. They’ve had many months in which to do so but they’re clearly more interested in adding shoddy looking attractions and more features so they can advertise a bloated feature list in the final game. The game is so broken that it would require such a radical redesign of everything to fix it that they might as well release it as a different game entirely. If you’re a fan of the theme park sim genre this is one to avoid, any of the other games are far more enjoyable. RCTW is the first game I’ve played where I found myself just wanting to do household chores instead of playing :( "

												EDIT: Got the game to work. Finally.Another edit: Lagspikes when picking something to place. Really? Lagspikes everywhere...""Please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines."" This is what steam is telling me to do if I'll write a review. Well, ok then. I was about to curse the crap out of this title. But I'll keep it polite, for steams sake.Oh and don't think I'll be adding any fancy headers to this review. The devs didn't put effort into their game so I won't put effort into my review.Where to begin. Ah yes. I'll start with the early access period. Since that's when I bought this game.I've got something important to tell you about this period: The game actually started and I could build a park!!! Yea, I know right?! It worked somehow! That is, until the game couldn't keep up with all the things I placed and the park actually getting busy. At this moment. The framerate dropped, and at that point I usually just quit the game. But hey, no hard feelings. This was Early Access after all. It's still under development and I knew this.Fast forwarding to the present...Full release is finally here. The game is complete and playable. Or is it?Well. For me it's not. The only working thing seems to be the play button in the steam client. After that, I get a black screen with nothing on it except for a working ""alt+tab"" steam overlay. I thought I might've been the problem. So I went to the discussions board and guess what. I wasn't the only one with this ""black screen of death"". The devs even put up a sticky, explaining what to do to fix the issue. And guess what again?! The fixes didn't work! So now I'm stuck with a game I paid €31,99 for and I can't even play! I trusted these devs. I believed in them. Even when things, close to release, were still buggy or not even working. And they didn't fix♥♥♥♥♥♥So. This game doesn't work for way too many people. This isn't some rare bug that's happening. This is just another ""broken on launch"" game like so many others nowadays. This shouldn't be a problem. But it is. If anyone is reading this, I recommend you to wait till tomorrow and buy planet coaster. It looks like they do have a working themepark game that happens to be 10x more advanced than this excuse of a game. Hell, the game was more advanced in their alpha while this was in the beta.Remember. Today is the day Rollercoaster Tycoon died.Yours sincerely,An angry customer.			"

								Before reading this be aware that i also own the alpha of Planet coasters but gave both games a very fair chance.I purchased RCTW because it was due to release last december well before planet coaster release date.The beta came out and well i thought it wasnt bad, and that they were just hiding the features from us to keep as a suprise, turns out its cause they didnt actually have anything. In its current state this game is completely unplayable. I have an absolut beast pc but the game lags so hard all the time even with an empty park that i cant play for more then 10 mins. Path making is the worst iv ever seen in any game PERIOD, is the snap function some sort of inside joke? because its ALWAYS ON. paths do as they want and there is no room for people to get creative as there is no clipping allowed, the grid system is just some sort of crule prank and the peeps animations are reminisant of early gameboy graphics. Don't get me started on placing buildings, just.. just dont. it's not even worth explaining how frustraing and down right crap it is. One pro i will give this game is that the way you build coasters is really really fantastic, its so simple and feels so natural to me. Shame the game can only achive 2 fps on a 980ti and i7 so you cant enjoy that either. It honestly has gone backwards from the beta weekend. Please Atari get a new developer on this ASAP as Nvissio seem to be the most budget and clueless group to ever make a game.Playing the alpha of Planet coaster, well it already has a ton more content, far better graphics and runs like a dream. It leaves you to create anything you can possibly imagine. trust me when i say you should pick it up its just the game we always dreamed of, made by the original devs of RCT3 and their passion /  love and attention clearly shines through on planet coaster.EDIT: alot of people say that the 2 are totally different games, but that isnt the case at all, obviously they have differences but they are the same. its crazy not to think that. My biggest beef is that this game had a release date last year! and what they have now is easily 1 or 2 years away from release. As well as cheating all the november beta testers who i bet are all the ones leaving the negative reviews as i am.			"

												Been gaming a long time--since the text-only version of Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Own and played all the RCTs. Got into this in early access and gave it chance after chance after chance. Bottom line after a hundred hours? It's just not a good game. It's resemblence to the previous entries in this franchise is vague at best. There's no real financial engine to speak of. Peeps behavior is erratic and un-human. Graphics are okay but just okay. I want to say the price point is too high but I'm not sure I could recommend it at any price.At the end of the day, it's not fun. It doesn't have to be giggly, wacky fun--it can be challenging fun. But it's no fun. Really, don't be tempted. Steer clear. Sorry. I'm disappointed, too.			"

												Where do I start - I'll keep it simple. I have been a strong supporter of RCT since the day RCT1 was out - and couldn't wait for this installment. Sadly, Atari have not listened to the community and decided not to spend the money on a proper software house, like Fronter, who made RCT3. Instead, a decidedly poor version has been created. The beta looked promising, but it went down hill from there. The graphics are awful, the scalling is all wrong, the audio works randomly, the frame rate on a high-end machine is poor and the over all experience and ambience of the game is a total let-down. This does not keep the RCT franchise going. I'm afraid I cannot recommend this game to anyone - especiallly when the competition (Planet Coaster) was so much better, in every single way. I've just deleted it from my PC. Waste of money.			"

												They lied period. The things and the fun they promised, they did not deliver. All that public feedback went to waste as they never listend to anything. The only good part about this game is their rollercoaster builder and the park lights, that's it. Everything else is a complete and absolute mess. Even with all of their upgrades before full release the game is an absolute mess. I bought this game in early access and I will never make that mistake ever again, especially when it comes to Atari games. I feel like i've been manipulated and robbed and I've never felt that way before about a game. They kept making all these grand promises even from last year this time when it was originally supposed to be FULLY RELEASED!, and still the game is a complete mess. I wish I could honestly get my money back, I should have gotten a refund when they went into early access, but I believed their promises instead of the many people suggesting I should have gotten a refund. I preordered the Deluxe Edition and that's a lot of money down the drain just to get something not even close to what was promised. I'm really sad. :'(			"

												This is the worst RCT game ever created (and I have played them all since the first version). I would have taken a refund over writing a bad review, but since Steam refused, they earned it.The gameplay is glitchy (when it runs), and the graphics are awful. I have a 3.6ghz i7, 16gb ram, with an nVidia 4gb video card. I regularly play games much more taxing (like Diablo 3) with 0 problems so there really is no excuse. After dealing with the initial failures (constantly locking up before the game even finished loading), then the actual in-game crashes/graphics errors, I can definitely say this product should be a free demo until they figure out what they are doing. It should never have been offered as a pay item in this condition.I understood that the game was 'a bit buggy' when I bought it--that is one of the reasons I think imposing a time limit on the refund is absurd. Most of us were wating to see if the game ever became playable, and not just jump-ship--I have learned my lesson. Next time, I will request the refund at the first sign of problems, instead of waiting in hopes of someone actually fixing the problem--that way I do not exceed any time limits. "

Early Access Review
								Oh god. No. This game is not good.Graphics: Graphics are better than launch but still not good. Occasionally the game will freeze for a second and once it un freezes all the shadows and lighting are gone.Peeps: No. They have no facial animations, the textures are trash, the models are trash, the animations are HORRIFIC. The peeps don't ever even walk in groups. No families or anything. They walk around the park alone and horribly. (I don't think 8 year olds go to parks alone Nvizzio. Just saying.)Coaster Builder: Best part of the game. But thats not saying much. You can make some cool things, but it's very finicky. The physics are much of a pain. The sounds of the coasters are HORRIBLE. The coaster cam is jittery and not smooth at all.Buildings: There isn't any piece by piece building system. The premade buildings are a pain to place, not very good looking, alot of them have pretty much the same exact design with just a small little change to signal that this is a differnet building than this other.UGC: Arguably the best part. To me this is the only thing that is going for this game.Paths: No. They don't even want to connect to 90% of other paths.Performance / Optimization: Trash. The optimization is not good at all.Overall: This game is not worth the money. Spent less than half of the money for the full version of Planet Coaster. Its SECOND ALPHA is much more polished and has much more features than this game that was supposed to be FULLY RELEASED in December of 2015. Buy Planet Coaster, it is the true sequal to RCT3. "

Early Access Review
								RollerCoaster Tycoon World (Early Access)This game is heart breaking to say the least, as a huge rollercoaster tycoon fan I was greatly disspointed with the outcome.Unfortunately, it comes down to the ""cons"" outweighing the ""pros"".Problems i've encountered while playing the game:-The park guests: They are unrealistic in the way the move around the park, they constantly glitch and get stuck in queue lines which holds everyone else back. Seems like 1 out of 3 of them ether puke on the floor or throw garbage, making it impossible to keep up with the cleaning of the park. You can't pick them up anymore. I could go on.- The park workers: Picking them up is very choppy and not smooth. having to find them instead of having a menu with all of them listed get's frustrating. Because so many guests seem to want to litter and puke every 10 steps you need an army of them to keep the place clean. You can no longer set them to be in a certain area ( was nice to set them on specific, always messy paths.- The FPS: The frames per second of the game dramatically drops after you get over 1000 guests (which can happen within the first hour or so of playing). And yes, I have a great gaming laptop that should allow me to run it. It becomes unbarable and unplayable after just an hour or two of building up your park.Lack of customization: Can no longer render the buildings or coasters a different color. Can only select a small number of pre-made buildings. designs of pre-made buildings seem lazy, copied like other buildings with slight changes.Roller coaster building: It all feels confusing and complex and it's so difficult to get it exactly the way you like it. It should be a simple build consept first, and if you feel really creative, go into the expert custom mode. You can no longer change the train cars, or how many train cars you can have. The train stations are too big.My personal thoughts: I believe they really wanted to deliver a great game but unfortunately for everyone it just isn't up to par. RollerCoaster Tycoon has been one of my personal favorite franchises since I was a kid, and to me a game like this shouldn't be about graphics, but more about the gameplay, the options, the customization. I think all those qualities suffered because they wanted the game to look pretty, which is unfortunate because the game will even make the strongest of computers lag and make the rollercoaster tycoon experience unenjoyable. Little glitches here and there can be easily fixed, but from what I can see so far, the major issues are irreversible at this late stage of the game, even at early access.It pains me to say this, but I do not recommend this game.5/10 Rating-Darkwisemonkey			"

								  It is a real shame this game does not run as intended. I really wanted to like this game. The developers could have easily put another 6 months to a year into the game before even putting it on Early Access.   Ive played a solid 12 hours so far. It always starts out great, but as you grow your park the glitches keep coming. Peeps walking aimlessly to no where, there is no control over park staff, paths CONSTANTLY moving on me, cannot delete some paths for reasons i cannot understand. One of the biggest bugs is saving your game, logging out, then coming back later. It takes about 20 minutes to load up sometimes, a lot of the time as soon as its loaded it crashes instantly. Ive had a start 4 new parks because my saved games would not load. If it does load, its a mess, paths moved and uneditable, terrain changed drastically, peeps in the middle of nowhere. Its very frustating building a park and borderline impossible to continue after leaving and coming back   With all that, there is a lot of potential for the game. The graphics look great for a RT game, the rollercoaster building is absolutly amazing, the possiblilties are endless when building. There is actually a good amount of content, rides, coasters, stands, scenery. The game itself looks and feels great at short glance, but in the long run, it needs so much more work. I would recommend buying this in 6 months time so they can work out the glitches.			"

												So I got the Beta test and, well it was a Beta test, there were some bugs but all in all I think the game has a pretty solid base. The new Coaster builder is a little confusing at first but once I got the hang of it I had a lot of fun.To those who are demanding refunds, at least give it a chance and wait until release before wanting your money back. They released this beta test for a reason, to find bugs in what is likely the buggiest part of the game, so at least have the faith to give them until release to judge it.			"

												I had very high hopes for this game. Like most people I grew up playing the RCT series. I have very wonderful memories about those games. However this game did not really give me very good memories like I had as a child. I bought this game back in June and it is now November. What has changed......NOT MUCH!!! This game is still very barebone and restrictive unlike Planet Coaster which I waited to buy till now. Why? I actually hoped and believed the game would be better. Unfortunately it is not and still plays as if it is in an alpha or a beta. Path glitches, very unsmooth gameplay when riding coasters, the coasters feel fake, and in the scenarios half the time I failed them because the special guest never found the dang restuarant or ride they wanted or thought it was too expensive. Im still going to play this game to compare how it is to planet coaster but I kinda have lost hope in this game as it still does not have water rides or transport rides at launch.			"

								So many of the faults of this game have already been gone over, so I don't have to repeat most of them.... As a lot of others, I bought this game solely because I have enjoyed the previous versions (RCT2 is my favorite). So I didn't even read the reviews of RCTW before I did the advanced purchasing. What a mistake that was! As someone previously stated, why in the world can you come out with a 'deluxe' upgrade when the main game is so uncomplete?? There are no transportation systems either - monorails, trains, trams, etc.! So I agree with the majority: Don't buy this game! $50? (well, $49.99 - still a ripoff) Would I recommend this game: Absolutely NOT!			"

Early Access Review
As of August 14, 2016I was really looking forward to the next successor, but this is a failsessor at the moment. I've been keeping track and reading every new ""patch"" they put out. But I haven't played it in a few months now. I just looked it up on YouTube to save me the headache and I watched Olli43 give it another shot. (He put up a vid about it on July 6, 2016) To his and my disappointment, the path systems are still a mess, the game is still not optimized for full sized parks, and the peeps literally 'float' around like ghosts from a short distance away, I guess to make up for the fps. That doesn't really work given that the engine needs a complete overhaul.In fact, this game needs to be completely re-done. Do yourselves a favor (whoever is the publisher, maker), take this game off Steam. Rework EVERYTHING from the ground up and start over. These parks are so bland and boring. You can't customize hardly anything besides placing a limited amount of assets. I guess they rely on us to make all of the cool stuff. What a lazy approach. And what happened to the days when it was like RCT 1,2? They had assets and scenery out the wazoo!My money is on Planet Coaster. Yeah I said the name, this game is miles behind them! PC is way better than this. Now prove me wrong. Oh, and PC is coming to Steam, so watch out RCTW.I want this game to be great, I really do. But I fear the worst right now. I mean, look at the reviews on here. An overall rating of Mostly Negative with an approval rate of 33%? That is a lot to bounce back from. That's why I'm suggesting to just start over.-Good dayChief			"

Early Access Review
								We're sad that we have to give this a thumbs down. My husband & I have been Atari fans since we got our first Atari Game System back in like 1981. Anybody remember Pong? Yeah...we're old...We bought the Deluxe version of this back in Nov thinking the release date would be Dec 10th.  We aren't upset about spending that money, however, we're shocked at what this has turned out to be so far.The Pro's1.) Early Access- good on Atari to recognize that they needed to put something out there.2.) Performance- we have a great computer that my husband built, so no performance issues like others have had.   Occasional choppiness, but hey, it's a computer game.3.) Graphics-the parks actually look really pretty.4.) Coaster builder- far from perfect, but we actually made several cool coasters & each one took less & less time. The problem is that both the coasters & the pieces to build with are disproportionately large & the test stats are way off. (What exactly is the safety rating about, does anyone know?) I hope some of this is fixable & being worked on.The Con's1.) Navigation- we shouldn't have to use the keyboard to scroll around the park. It's not 1989. And can I please have an Undo button? I make a lot of mistakes!2.) Music- I know Matt said they're working on the custom music, but can we please put a rush on that before my head explodes? The music from RCT3 was so superb, I'd love to be able to import that into this game. Does anyone know if that's possible?3.) The Vomit- really? Every peep pukes coming off every ride? And now they pee on the path if they can't make it to the rest room? Sorry, but it's disgusting & childish.4.) Paths- we don't even know what to make of this. Very cumbersome. And we can't place buildings right on the main path. Not liking that at all.5.) The Peeps- it's like Night of the Living Dead went to a porn flick. What's with the weird moaning? And can someone please make the kid stop crying? I think my ears are bleeding. The peeps have no personality at all. They don't appear to be happy, sad or anything in between.6.) Rides- again, many seem disproportionately large. It just seems as if things aren't properly scaled. The fact that we can't move the entrances & exits is very odd. Why not? Also, the rides seem pricey, so why do we have to purchase the sign going over the ride?7.) Complaining- there's too much of it. It appears as if you all have taken a page from the first Zoo Tycoon, & not a good page. The animals were great in that game, but the peeps made me stop playing because of the constant complaining about things you couldn't even fix. Please don't make that same mistake with this game. 8.) Buildings- way too many restaurants & the builings are huge. Seriously, who goes to an amusement park thinking, ""Gee, I hope I can get a great Moo Goo Gai Pan while I'm here!"" And if you eat sushi, then get on a roller coaster, you're an idiot. No wonder there's puke everywhere. Don't get me started on the huge, ugly, unnecessary employee buildings. I hate this idea. But the Dev Blog dated April 1st states they will also be adding an admin building. And where are we supposed to place that? We have no room left in the park to place a rolller coaster, and with the park entrance being so huge, can't we just pretend that's where the employees go to rest? It's just a game, it doesn't have to be that realistic, it just has to make sense.9.) Breakdowns-is it just me or did the rides start breaking down as soon as I opened the park?10.) Entertainers- Oh. My. God. This is the worst thing of all to me.  The Dev Blog dated April 1st said the entertainers will amuse guests while they're queuing. I mean no disrespect, but did you guys actually play this game? I watched one exit their building, walk down a path, enter a queu, interact with exactly no one, turn around & go right back to his building. I told you those employee buildings were a bad idea! And I'm sorry, but that huge, hulking, ominous, predatory owl looking thing is just scary. Remember the shark entertainer from RCT3? My husband & I still love that guy. We named him Jerry. We would turn the game to its lowest speed so we could watch the kiddies laugh & jump up & down as he tried to bite their heads off, then he would joyfully skip away, with his little red sneakers on! So cute. Yeah, that's all gone, along with all the charm, cuteness & personality that was RCT3.We don't know what this game is, but we do know that it isn't RollerCoaster Tycoon. We have nothing but faith in Atari to make this right. We will continue to play, for what it's worth, and will amend our review as we see fit. Thanks for listening!PS- I'm not kidding, can I please have Jerry the Shark back???4/7/16-So, after today's update, still awful. Oh sure, the peeps LOOK better while they're peeing on my path right in front of the rest room, but my janitors are still ineffective. I do think the mechanics are working faster & I do appreciate the flat map. They have a long way to go before this review comes out of the thumbs down status!5/24/16-So I went in the game today for the first time in weeks. Sorry-still awful! It's not even interesting enough or fun enough to waste another minute playing. RIP, RCT.11/28/16- Holy crap, they took this thing out of early accesss??? Yikes, sorry to have wasted $60.00 on this. My husband & I are done with you, Atari. Considering we have been fans since you first started in 1974 & we were just kids, you can imagine our disappointment. Funny enough, we also own Planet Coaster & aren't impressed with that one either, although it's better than this nonsense. At least they weren't ridiculous enough to have peeps♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the path. Shame on you, Atari. Good luck digging yourselves out of this one.			"

												This game is aweful. In the year that I've had it, according to the Steam player, I've spent 8 hours playing the game. But I havnt! I have NEVER once gotten to play it, even with Beta. The 8 hours I've spent ""playing"" have actually been multiple attempts at running the game. I waited about 45 minutes each time, trying to open the game and then it crashes, for a total of about 8 hours. When the game does run, it is extremely lagging and crashes less than 2 minutes later. The worst part is that Steam wont give me a refund. I've tried for a refund several times and they refuse every time even after I tell them that I have never played the game because of the lagging and crashing and refusals to load.			"

								This is plagued with so many issues that i cannot recommend this game at all for the time being. Other reviews have stated in more detail why and what performance issues there are.This is just another case of an unfinished game brought out too early for ""Early access"" regardless of its current state. My MSI afterburner shows in game as my GPU at 19% / CPU at 10% and my Ram at 12GB yet my FPS was horrendus hovering around 9 - 13 FPS with only a single tile filled and a second tile part filled. I wouldnt mind if i had a low end system but running an i7 4790k - 16GB 2400Mhz Ram - GTX980ti and installing the game on an samsung 850 EVO SSD....just tells me this is poorly optimised with little progression since its release.I'll be honest, i made the mistake of thinking that frontier was behind this at first, considering how i love RTC3. Luckily I only paid £9.99 for this on the site that shall not be named so i can live with my mistake. Seeing how good RTC3 was and how good Elite dangerous is I think this game is going to be abandoned in my steam library and I'll happily pay 3x what i paid for this for Frontiers upcoming Rollercoaster development.Sorry Nvizzio Studios this is a poor effort and shouldnt be on steam for the price it is.

								I'll try to make this short. I really wanted this game to compete with Planet Coaster, but it doesn't even come close at all. Don't waste your time and money on this farce of a game. Everything from the peeps, rides, paths and their over-hyped piece by piece system. there's always something wrong with it. and don't believe the whole ""well it's in Early Access so it has an excuse to be crappy"" well what Atari doesn't want you to know is that they were planning to release this game at the end of 2015! claiming to only need to do some last minute polish. So why the jump to Early Access after claiming that it was ready? Planet Coaster.So what am I getting at here? If your going to buy an in-depth and deep simulated game with limitless creative possilbilities with the passion of its developers to back it up, go get Planet Coaster. Roller Coaster Tycoon World isn't even good enough to wipe your own backside with.			"

								Long time fan of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, this one however sucks so much its not even funny. If you want the true ""RCT4"" look at Planet Coaster. Planet Coaster is created by frontier, the same developer that made RCT3 and so far its an amazing game. This game (RCTW) is maybe worth $15 bucks at most. Its a waste of time and money.There are so many bugs and lagging issues that are not being fixed. Instead of fixing the bugs, the devs just keep adding more♥♥♥♥♥♥Fix the ♥♥♥♥ing game first you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

												The biggest dissappointment of 2016 hands down!  Even worse than No Man's Sky!  Aside from the mild update in the graphics this game has nothing to offer that RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 doesnt, in fact it has less.  First Off Game Performance is not great.  I will says its better than when it started off in early release but still even on my 1070 I get some stuttering when panning around the map.Secondly, The one thing I loved about all of the RCT games was park management, this version however has next to no park management.  Sure you can do some things but not nearly to the level of detail or variety that you could in previous versions.Thirdly, You cant customize anything.  In all Previous RCT games you could customize your stalls, rides, etc.  Nope not here, in this game what you see is what you get no more.  You cant change the colors of the rides, the lights on the rides.  You cant choose the color of the ballons that your balloon stalls sell, you can choose the types of foods your stalls sell, or what goes on your foods, none of that is here.There isnt alot of content here either, the previous games had a ton of content but again not with this one.  This version of RCT is but a pale reflection of what the original games were.  It seems to me that they went the extra mile to produce a watered down, pale reflection of what the previous games were.  I cant imagine what would make a company look at the success of its predecessors and say, nah we dont need that.  Bottom line is if you've never played RCT in any other form than you might like this game.  But if your like me and were expecting a better and greater version of a legendary franchise than your better off looking else where, this game aint got it.   Crappy launch combined with the shady way they marketed this game and even put out retail copies of the game while it was in pre-release is enough to make me swear off Atari and any further iterations of this game forever.  RCT died with this game RIP RCT!			"

								Without going into great detail it just seems like a 'mobile' type game. Animations, options, and optimization all seem incomplete. There are many limitations, like when you place a ride the entrance and exit are built in...things like that just limit the creativity, and isn't that the whole point of sim games? Overall the biggest thing is a lack of polish, especially when compared to another game coming out with the initials of PC.			"

												I was on board with this game since early alpha, and dear god was it a mess. and I checked back every few months to see how they improved it.   There were little improvements here and there, but it was like a kid failing with low F and who keeps turning in extra credit to improve his grade.  It helps, but still not great. Now official release comes around, and now its like a bland relationship thats noone's fault its sparkless, so you just keep saying, I'll just stick it out for a little longer. maybe things will get better right? its not bad.. just I don't know if I'm happy here. Things never get better, they never get worst, they coast along content but not really enjoying yourself.TL:DR- This is the most adequate of all mediocre average experiences that ever made someone vaguely complacent.

								Just another voice to add to the chorus of negative comments about this game.  I own all versions of Roller Coaster Tycoon.  I also own No Limits 2 and Planet Coaster (alpha) so I have a pretty good vantage point for comparisons.  I have no ties or loyalties to any of the dev shops making roller coaster builders.  I tried over and over to make RCTW work for me.  Yes, it does technically run but it is just a plain bad overall experience.  Even after waiting to allow more dev time before playing again, I was sorely disappointed.  This is an absolute waste of money.I know it's been said many times already but Planet Coaster is where you should set your sites.  I have no affiliation with Frontier whatsoever but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see they have their s**t together. "

								Unfortunately Atari dropped the ball big time with this game. I purchased it when it was still due to be realeased in full and not EA. Once it moved to EA, they gave us only a few hours to test and get a refund. Luckily I did, but know of a bunch of people who are stuck now. Atari please honor those who want to get a refund. It is not right on how little time you gave us. As for the game overall, the graphics are decent and as I have still kept up with the development, they have added a bunch of decent features. Then comes to this release date tomorrow.....not a wise idea. Heck check the forums. This game has made some progress and the only reason I can think that they are rushing to release is another theme park simulator game is coming out the the 17th. I personally like it better (Planet Coaster) as I loved RCT3. Planet Coaster is from the same developers and they have kept me and other customers very informed and updated. They did announced their release date before RCTW btw. I'd love to give this game another shot down the road, but from the feedback I've heard of current players, it just isn't worth it.			"

												(Buy Planet Coaster)RCT4 as been in development hell since RCT3 came out, a few years ago, Atari woke up and announced 2 RCT games, a PC version, and a mobile game (Yes, its bad)Since then, RCT World has been around 3 dev studios before being released, and it clearly shows, the game looks nothing like the original trailers which makes me expect that Atari forced the companies to start the game from scratch (Maybe each time)This game is a buggy, slow loading, bad performance mess, the only reason it was released was because of frontier announcing Planet Coaster (Frontier, who made RCT2 DLC and RCT3)The only interesting thing about this game, is that it runs unity, which makes the workshop support a little different (Because people can just give 3D models to the game and they turn into scenenery, so you can have nearly anything)			"

								Do not, I repeat do not waste your money on this game.  First time I've ever written a review on here but that's how disappointed I am by this game.  It has some many glitches in it, graphics are terrible (possibly worse than Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 which came out years ago) and for a game is just not enjoyable.  Feel so conned by this, though have now learned my lesson as the game is just not ready, I guess, hence Early Access, which from a major developer is pretty shameless to still charge full price.  This game will take months and months to fix, do not spend your money on it, I made that mistake and am now regretting not getting a lovely bottle of Malbec which would have been so much more enjoyable.  By the time they get this fixed, Planet Coaster will be out and that already looks 1000x better.  Please save your money, don't even think, ah I'm sure he's wrong, I'll give it a go, I repeat, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! ;)			"

												The game can't be compared to Planet Coaster.It's lacking in so many fundamental ways, and it seems that is in it's core, which will never change.It's a mobile game at best.That may be satisfactory for many people though.It has not brought much new to the table, and it even lacks quite a few things from RCT's past.The coaster builder has it's merits, and it's flaws. The sound design is terrible.Coasters sound like metal carts rolling down an empty marble floored hallway, with little to no nuance in regards to to the action. They sound the same on an air-time hill, as they do at the bottom of a fast, high-G trough.The paths....they dictate what you can do most of the time. You'll run into ""no, not there"" more often than not.Many of the ride animations are incorrect, if you are a fan of authenticity. Many of the rides are just ugly as well. Take the radioctive, glowing in the daytime ""Wave Swinger"" for instance. Boy is that an atrocity to behold!The newly ""re-designed"" peeps are still terrible. The animations are just bizarre. RCT 2 introduced peeps in pairs, and RCT3 introduced Groups. RCTW decided they should go back to the begining, and only have single peeps. Unsupervised children, no less. The peeps will wander around aimlessly through your park, and ignore the very things they are looking for. You have no clue how to satisfy them. The emoticons (REALLY?) floating over their heads are there to help, because the peeps are emotionless. It's good that they redid the scenarios for shorter play ""missions"", because the older your park gets, the less the peeps care to ride anything, even for free.Forget trying to attract as many peeps into your park as you possibly can. Most average computers will start catching on fire at around 3,000 peeps. The rival game becomes unplayable at around 15,000 peeps. that's FIVE TIMES THE CROWD!!!This game really has no soul, at all. There is nothing endearing to draw you in. Instead, it is rather off putting.I do not recommend this game to anyone. I voted it as ""Worse Game of the Year""			"

												I have been a fan of Roller Coaster Tycoon ever since the first game, and I've played 1, 2, and 3 almost religously. RCT was always a favorite of mine...that is untill this installment. I eagerly awaited for RCTW to go on pre-order and I pre-purchased the deluxe edition the day it was available. During the betas, the game was unplayable...but I had hope that upon at least early access they would have most of the bugs worked out and the features that I know and love would be availabel. Clearly I was duped. Here the game is ""finished"".....which is a laughable statement. The bugs are terrible, there are no water rides, transport rides, or dark rides. The learning curve for building coasters is STEEP...like about as steep as a dive coaster's first drop. The coasters don't even have shuttle mode. The Piece By Piece Building tool is horribly insufficent, and it just doesn't feel like the same series that I know and love. I honestly had hope with the node system that finally I could REALLY build the coasters of my dreams, make the buildings and scenery I had fantasized about....I believed I would be able to make coasters with the great scenery and storytelling that Disney does so well at thier parks. Nope. The potential for buildings and structures is severely limited. The amont of scenery items is decent, but nothing like the past titles. Building a working and fun coaster is a treamendous chore, requiring so much trial and error, when before it was more inuitive, despite the grid system. Do yourself a favor, and save your money. If you want a theme park sim that actually is fun, I do suggest Planet Coaster, It's defintly different than RCT, but in my opinion it flows much better, runs smoother, and the scenery and buildings potential is what I have been asking for for years. I think PC still needs more work, but it's miles ahead of RTC.			"

												Release Review 11/18/16: Game blacks screen while starting, I know this going to happen and decides that Planet Coaster and Parkitect is the best games beside this pile of crap. Atari hired the wrong guys to do this game and ruined a game series that almost runs through two decades and people love. Once again, DON'T BUY THIS GAME and go and buy yourself Planet Coaster made by Frontier or if you have a machine that can't handle it then go Parkitect which is made by a small group of indie devs. Remember that you can also buy RCT2 on Steam and install OpenRCT2. NOT WORTH THE $35!Review Update (4/2/2016):So I have played the game again when it came out as early access and they added flat rides into the game but it doesn't meet any of my expectations. The coaster builder is laggy and physics are so horrible. The game crashed on me when I have my park while in load of 1,950 guests which is total disapointment, I had that problem on RCT 3 most of the times on my older machines. I run a PC with a GTX 760 2GB VRAM, 16GB of RAM, and an 2nd Gen Intel Xeon and it would lag like crap while building a coaster. October Beta Weekend 1 Review (11/2/2015):This is probalay the worst game that you would buy for $50. I feel like they are rushing to push this game out and they have over a month left to complete and polish it so it looks like $50 but not this piece of unstable crap. When I test ran my coasters that it will crash on random parts of the track. Yes, this game doesn't have any sense of physics what so ever. When I put tight banking that I get a message ""slope too steep"", this is the first RollerCoaster Tycoon games to not introduce grid building. The game will crash and freezes at times and I guess it has something to do with the camera modes.Well, I can't really expect or recommend this to be good just for the $60 I have spent (I have bought the Deluxe Edition) if there's any improvements. If this game came out this way then I will feel very turned down and regretting myself buying this game that won't work at it's price. If you want a good roller coaster management game then try to get either Parkitect if you like RCT 1 & 2 style or if you have the money then go and get Planet Coaster Early Bird or else wait. PROS:+No grids unlike the other RCT games.+Different size stalls+Curved Paths+A bit of good lightingCONS:-Poor phyisics on the guests, coasters, and flat rides.-Coaster builder can be very laggy.-Game will crash if your park is in heavy load or the game won't handle the graphics.-Limited music selection-The lack of objects to build buildings with scenery.-Coasters would fail if not built correctly.-Brakes can have a very strong force into them.-Terrible Graphics and Shadows			"

								This game is beyond awful. This game crushed my hopes and dreams for a theme park game with 'tycoon' in the name. Planet coaster is where i will be spending my future money. Tycoon World lied about the gameplay. Its not at all as intuitive as the trailers or gameplay had shown. I was roped into buying the deluxe edition which came with all prior tycoon games. I played the world beta. It was awful. Then played it again a few months later after it was delayed. I thought they would have fixed the issues such as pathing, placement and coasters always flying off the track (touchy little buggers). Nope! I attempted to get my money back but was denied since i played the old tycoon games more than 4 hours. What a rip off. I have no faith in Tycoon World or the developers. I feel cheated and lied to. Just awful.... so sad.			"

								Extremely disappointed in this game, but hoping it will improve by the time release date comes around. The rides and shops available are extremely limited compared to the older games--no transport rides like monorail, train, elevator etc as in Tycoon 1,2 and 3. Terrain editing is not as flexible as it used to be, either, and they've taken away the undo button which is also extremely annoying especially when it comes to terrain editing. Not as many different textures available for the terrain either. Don't waste your money with the early access, wait until the final game comes out if you are really feeling optimistic. Good thing I at least got it for less through an employer discount but still a waste of $20.			"

								After reading so many negative reviews I thought ""Stop your ♥♥♥♥♥ing, there must be something good about the game."" And there is. Building a coaster works great! The freeform mode enables you to go loose on your wildest imaginations. After building an awesome wooden coaster I was satisfied with, I thought it would be time to form the scenery. So after going to the scenery and clicking on a rock -Hey wait, where is my rock? Wait, is anything still happ- NO! game crashed because you clicked on a rock.Does a scenario like this bother you? No? Great!Do you like a very pixel-like ground to refreshen your nostalgic feelings of RCT 3? No? Perfect!You want to have a futuristic park where earth has been invaded by robots and have human-like robots in your park? Well, look no further. This game has it all!I'm sorry for being so sarcastic. Honestly, I went into the game with a positive vibe, but this game just is not going to do it for me. I'm also sorry for comparing the game to Planet Coaster, as everyone is doing, but once you play this game you know why everyone is falling back on planet coaster. The alpha already looks incredible and their scenery building options already surpass RCTW. Please, save your money. It IS a waste of money.			"

Planet Coaster is by FAR the better game.I purchased RCTW back in 2015, when it was going to be released in December.  I played the beta, and then I was sad.PC is better at the ""tycoon"" functions, its path building is WAY better, the graphics are better, performance is better, and peeps are better.About the only thing that RCTW has that PC doesn't is that the ability to purchase more land.I guess the most important thing for me is that RCTW feels like work, not play.  PC is fun, I want to play it.  I find myself dreading RCTW and looking forward to PC.  Because of that, I can't recommend RCTW.			"

								I'm another stubborn buyer. After seeing all negative reviews I still wanted to see myself. First 20 mins ""this isnt so bad"". 3 hours later after running 20fps on my 970/4.2ghz/32 ram I am frustrated. The coaster builder is beyond terrible, so frustrating trying to build anything. Good luck placing buildings down that connect to your paths. The most frustrating thing to me so far besides frame rate is building paths. Everything i do is invalid and you cant simply delete a path that i know about. You have to click bulldozer, click the path, click paths icon, click the path you want, then build again. Honest opinion from a franchise fan is it's a huge step back from RCT3. Looking to buy Planet Coaster.			"

												I bought this game over a year ago and remained optimistic throughout the beta and early access cycle. Even while the final version was downloading, I was hoping Atari would pull the rabbit out of the hat. That optimism was immediately shattered when I was greeted with a black screen on launch. Luckily I was able to find the problematic files and delete them. Yes my reason for this is mostly over that one bug, which apparently affects only people who installed the game while it was still in early access. But it's not the fact that the bug exists and prevented game play, but the handling of it by the Atari and Nvizzio. When I found out I was unable to play, I immediately took to the community page and found the post saying the release was out, accompanied with instructions on deleting a file if you have problems. That didn't work. Instead it took me deleting the entire folder. Then I watched as developers and producers spent the day telling people to delete files in hidden folders and edit the registry. These are things even Microsoft advises against, especially editing the registry.We are talking about a bug that could easily be remedied with a dozen lines or so of code and a hot fix. Instead the developers opted to have users jump through hoops, access parts of their system that shouldn't be accessed by the average user, and risk doing irreparable harm to their operating system. This is one of the biggest failures in not only public relations, but also custom service I have ever witnessed. I have been doing development for 30 years and the past 15 years has been as the owner of my own company. If I ever even dreamed of taking this approach to a failure on my part, I would expect to close the doors the next day, and rightfully so. The latest release in the series I have loved for years has been fatally plagued by this decision from the publisher and developers. I was hopeful for improvements and expansions to RCTW, but after the lack of response over yesterday's problems, it's painfully obvious that we most likely won't see these, when they won't even fix a bug that was known at release, and causing a PR nightmare. Shame on Atari and shame on Nvizzio.			"

								There's a lot of arguing going on right now, but the fact that almost every negative review has the words ""Planet Coaster"" in them is worrying. I'm going to try my absolute hardest to give a review on the game without resorting to comparisons. Any point of interest I place an asterisk (*) at the end of is possibly subject to change, and reflects the March 30th launch only.The good:Coaster builder - Very useful and well-made. The color safety guide is also very helpful for setting up your coaster in advance as well, so that you can know what does, and does not work.Area themes - Adds an interesting way for scenery variation to effect certain areas. Also contains variations of each building as well.Steamworks support - Modding adds unlimited potential in every game.Terrain editing - Excellent terrain manipulation tool. Not really much else to say without adding pointless padding.The okay:Paths - We finally have curved paths, along with several variations. Only problem is that it can occasionally get wonky with terrain collision, or pathing intersection. No curved queue lines, sadly.*Scenery selection - Decent amount of stock scenery with the base game, however certain themes such as Sci-Fi are lacking in options. Modding could fix.*Difficulty - This is bad for me, but some people prefer it easy. I'm a veteran of RCT and RCT2, so I prefer biting my nails when it comes to funding, however just building a small portion of the park, and working on a coaster can set you for a good while in terms of funds.The bad:Fences - Fences are badly implemented. Can only place them one at a time, and at angled intervals. Hopeful they will add line tools, or at least an option to place along paths.*Staff - Staff control is basically minimal at this point. Place the building down, select how many you want hired, and hope they do their job, let alone efficiently.*Performance - There are certain options to minimize graphical load in exchange for increased performance, however certain tools, will bring your frame rate to a crawl under certain circumstances. (EX: Path tool works fine unless it's clipped to an existing path, in which case my frame rate drops by at least half.)*Graphics - Not great, to say the least, but they could be much worse. I don't really come in to Unity games with high expectations, though.Overall, it's not as amazing as RCT1 and RCT2 obviously, but I do like it more than RCT3, which I never really transitioned into. On launch, it's a 6/10 for me. I'm curious to see where the future updates will bring this though, as I really do see potential.			"

												Grrr!! This game is so frustrating!I really wanted to look past all the negative publicity for this game, and give the devs the benefit of the doubt, but there are so many issues that I've noticed, and I've only been playing for about an hour? The controls for one thing are so unintuitive, and I've been trying to tweak them for the last 20 minutes. Who defaults ""Q"" for right and ""E"" for left rotate?!? And I tend to frequently change game speeds, so I always enjoy the 1,2,3 controls in most games, except this game that's not the case, and there is no way to assign keys to change from pause to speed 3. Instead, I keep having to tap on TAB. Not a huge issue, and I can look past that.Placing scenery now. It looked so simple in the trailer, but when I attempt to place scenery, it doesn't automatically lock onto the nearest snap location, and instead makes me scroll through degrees of angle and direction until it finally finds a snap spot. In cases that there are only two snap spots, why not just snap one or the other, why should I have to scroll through the rest when I can't place my items between anyways?When I attempt to place scenery, it always seems to be defaulted backwards, or upsidedown, so 9 times out of 10 I have to move it around until it faces me. Wouldn't it be simpler just to have scenery face me first, then let me move it around where I want?Unlocking scenery and rides now. Fine, it's the developers decision to lock everything up and force you to play through the scenarios, unless you play sandbox. But I want to build a park, and turn on research, like all the other RCT games before this one, but I don't see the research option on here at all. I enjoyed that aspect of the game, and having rides unlock as I'm playing just adds more fun to the game, in my opinion.Placing scenery and objects. I was trying to add objects to the path, and for some reason it picked up a peep and threw him in a deep ravine, so I went down looking for him, and did not find him anywhere. Did he fall through the ground? I was getting a warning message that an ""entity is under water"". So I tried to remove the water, and he was nowhere to be found. The warning went away though. Personally, the message could have said, ""Peep is under water"", or ""Help! Peep is Drowning!"" Something funny like that. I still can't explain how I was able to pick him up and throw him into the ravine while I was rotating an sign object that was clipping through the path, and looked awful... Unfortunately this appears to be an unfinished game, and for the price, I think it's too expensive right now. There would need to be a major overhaul of the entire game engine to make this game somewhat intuitive and user friendly, but at this time, it's just frustrating, and hard to have fun with it.So, at this time, I cannot recommend this game in it's current state.

												Epic fail. I was determined to play though this game despite the many, MANY game-breaking bugs. I had to replay many of the levels multiple times in order to fulfill the level requirements. Sometimes, an influencer would just never show up (you can't advance without influencers). Sometimes, an influencer WOULD show up and then just run around without fulfilling his mission. Occasionally, peeps would refuse to get on some of the rides (or all of them). Often, the game would require me to put down 4 hat shops or 2 family rides (just for example)  but would fail to recognize when I completed those requirements.Still, I persisted. For most of the game, I found ways around these inexcusable inconveniences. I had to play certain levels 3 or 4 times, but eventually, I figured out how to complete them despite all the bugs. Unfortunately, my luck ran out on the last 3 levels. 2 of the last 3 levels just would not let me complete some of the requirements no matter what I tried and no matter how many times I replayed them. The final level WOULD NOT LOAD. Like ever. I've never even seen the final level because the game crashes every time I try to load it. I spent many hundreds of hours playing RCT3, so I was determined to get through this game at all costs. Call me nostaligic. I was willing to overlook the game's many cosmetic issues and minor glitches. I was wiling to replay levels and to invent workarounds - something I shouldn't have to do (obvi). But even with all my stubborn determination, I was unable to complete THREE buggy levels. I've owned this game since alpha, and I've put off writing this review because I hoped against hope the developers would fix enough of the bugs to make this game playable. Unfortunately, that's not the case. This game is broken. Don't waste your money :(			"

								Ughhhhhh. I tried. I truly tried to like this game. It just isn't happening. The coaster designer is either really buggy or incredibly hard to figure out. The lack of content is appalling. Gone are the classic flat rides and thrill rides. No go karts. No log flume. No bumper cars. No mouse coaster. No transport rides. It is a glorified version of RCT 4 Mobile. It is useless to try to build a park because it lags even the best machines. The path system is rubbish. The free-form placement is not that at all. It a money grab. Do yourself a favor and go grab PLANET COASTER and Parkitect. Atari went all EA and murdered a classic game. It is heartbreaking. 2/10 don't click buy, it's a scam.			"

												The game was pretty good in Early Access. It improved with every update for a while. Then the update before the Full Release, it started crashing trying to load any park (saved or new). After the offical release I followed the recommended steps to avoid problems with switching from Early Access to the Full Release and it still crashs. I waited for the last update before writing a review and surprise it still crashs  trying to load a park. One small difference with the last update is opening in sandbox mode it loads the park for about 5 seconds before crashing. I even tried uninstalling the game twice and reinstalling but the game is unusable. But hey, the game menu that loads looks pretty good I guess.			"

								Some of the things that were super easy to do in RCT and RCT2 are so difficult to do now.  I don't like how you can't delete trees or scenery just by left clicking while building rides.  Also, trees and scenery aren't automatically deleted when placing track like it used too which makes it difficult to build.  When building roller coasters it will say invalid location and it isn't very clear why it is an invalid location.  Is it because it is too high?  Or are there trees/scenery in the way?  The bulldozer tool is also very hard to use.  It's hard to delete small objects.  I find myself clicking on items 10 times before it actually deletes.  This game honestly is a pain to play.  The new track building tools are cool but not very easy to use.  This game needs a lot of work.			"

								I really wanted to love this game, but it is really bad. The graphics are horrible, the gameplay is dumb, there are basic things that you can't do, like lowering the terrain or trying to build a ride if there is scenery on the way. I know it is an early access game but for the price and considering the amount of delays the game has had you can easily come to the conclussion that the game is far from done. I'm sad that the RollerCoaster franchise has  ended in a game like this. This is not what the developers promised so many months ago.			"

												I really wanted to like the game, but I just couldn't. From the framerate issues to lack of piece x piece content just irks me. I understand that the devs are trying to push User Generated Content, but it's a pain when there isn't much to offer in the form of stock content, combined with the fact hardly anyone actually plays the game let alone people creating said UGC. The minor tweaks they did to the ""peeps"" really did nothing and any other optimization went to pot. I ended up pre-ordering Planet Coaster and it's sad that even the alpha of that game offered more than this did. I just wished I could refund this game, but I didn't purchase this from steam directly. Note to Steam, keep the 2 week limit, but increase the time played limit for your refund policy for cluster**** games like this.			"

Early Access Review
								Very, very disappointing.  I have wasted my money!!!The developers have departed from the very successful player placing of ride entrance and exit in favour of the fixed variety which makes formal or neat park design virtually impossible.  Add to this the peculier pathing which forces odd angles on path junctions.  Every park will end up unplanned and  higgledy-piggledy. There seems to be no concession to disabled players with too many actions dependent on key pressing which many disabled gamers cannot do or can achieve with only great difficulty and in my case pain.  Shame when the older RCT games and so many other games allow for this.  (Just two examples of many:- The Sims or, for a real cheapy designed by a very small developer, ""Good Folk"".)  All or almost all actions should be available through use of the mouse as a secondary method of playing.Rotating of rides is unbelievably slow and cumbersome even for those with full use of their hands.  My son gave up in frustration within a few minutes of attempting to place rides.My advice to the developers is - Back to the drawing board.  Though, it will be a very long time before I consider buying any new versions of RCT.			"

								Please save your money and buy RCT3, a much better game that has a lot better camera motions. While riding the sorry excuse for a coastercam, the camera jolts forward all of the sudden. The coasters themselves make no sense because when it says intensity Im not sure we have the same understanding for that. The amount of detail is amazing, infact you can zoom right in and see lots of little details about the peeps but thats the only good thing about the peeps. The peeps complain about EVERYTHING, I had ~50 peeps in my park with all wide paths and they complained it was crowded.Please keep in mind that this game is in fact /EARLY ACCESS/ but it's no good right now. I played about an hour and have now requested a refund because it's, in my opinion, not very good.If you are going against the 1,066 negative reveiws (as of April 4th 2016 at 8:25PM).. Make sure you have a VERY beefy computer. I'm above the minimal requirements at got ~20-15 FPSPlease developers work really hard, because what scared me was this game was almost the full release 5 months ago.			"

Early Access Review
								Here’s the thing. I paid full game money and got a pre-Alpha build. I expect more from Atari. This is why you see everyone everywhere saying not to pre-order games. Reminds me of when the new Sim City launched, now Maxis is dead. I get that we’re on the 3rd dev now but this is insane.Don’t buy this game. It is not worth $50.First off the graphics are sub-par, at best, and even on low settings the frame rate is awful. There are terrible issues with building scale, little food stands being as big as full rides for starters. There is barely enough content to make a themed section of a park.I basically used up all the rides in 2 zones. You get 9 zones. WTF am I supposed to do with the rest of the zones? Make my own coaster with 20 FPS and a terrible coaster builder? The coaster builder sucks. It is not intuitive. It doesn’t let you add special tracks easily; you can’t make the kind of coasters you want. I was trying to make a simple Six Flags Superman style ride. Can’t do it. RCT3 could do it. How does a full version of the game not have at the very bare minimum what the last version had? RCT3 came out in ’04 and you want me to believe you can’t have all that stuff added into a new game in ’16?!?! If they had just taken RCT3 and put it into a new engine so it looked better and ran smoother, I’d be more happy than I am with wasting the money I did on this garbage.Pathing is awful. There is a lot of really weird snapping and even using the grid it’s hard to make straight lines. Curved paths almost seem easier which doesn’t make sense.The delete tool is garbage, and… oh what’s that you want to play one of the scenarios? Cool. Have fun trying to place rides anywhere. If there are trees or tiny little bushes you can’t plop stuff down, you first have to use the god-awful delete or move tools to get rid of the plants. One by freaking one. You would think you could just right click and the game would know you want to delete that stupid bush but apparently that’s too much to ask for.The list goes on and on. You can’t get your staff to do what you’re paying them to do. There is literally no guidance for how to please people or how to keep them from puking after every damn ride. Even the giant slide. The economy is dumb.Don’t buy this game. Odds are Atari is going to pull the plug on it rather than give it dev time it needs. You would literally be better off taking $50 and and burning it for the few moments of heat it provided you. "

Early Access Review
								It has been some time since the release of RCTW Early Access and I feel the game has reached a level where a review is warranted. There have been many negative reviews, and I can see the frustrations that led many to leave such, but a lot of those seem to have dismissed the game after a few moments of play. Not giving the game a chance to show off its potential.And in Early Access, potential is what we want to consider, The foundation that RCTW has laid is such that it may very well grow into that potentail we can glimpse. Should UGC become full, and each day we see more pieces added, should Piece by Piece building with the UGC be solved, and each update we see that happening. Then the foundation could lead to overwhelming success.At present, for those who are creative, the park builders, I would say the game has enough that you can find many hours of contentment playing it. For those who are problem solvers and want to play scenarios, we are not quite there yet with needing AI to balance better, with the scenarios to be tweaked better. But for the $50 price, it is closer each to day to be the successor to RCT3. At present the trajectory that it is on, may never get us to being equal or better than RCT3. But perhaps one rung below it. Though should more coaster types, more rides, more more more be released, then it might even surpass RCT3 for at present the graphics are better. Should the gameplay expand, UGC be optimized and the others items that we can see the potential to better happen, then yes, we shall have a GAME!			"

Early Access Review
								In its current state RCTW is a complete flop - there I've said it. I am keeping in mind that this is an alpha, however; it is stil just as dissapointing to me. When you look at Roller Coaster Tycoon you recognize a franchise that is well known for being composed of quality games. Well I'm sad to say that after RCT4 - Mobile and the Alpha of RCTW that this may now be a false statement. As a lifelong fan of this game (I've been playing it since the original and since I was old enough to understand how to play video games) I am remaining cautiously optimistic about the future of this game, I see its potential and the ability of the community to greatly improve each other's experiences through the vast network of custom scenery objects now available on the Steam Workshop.In its current state I'd rate the game no higher than a 5/10 and here's why:- The coaster builder is VERY clunky, occasionally it becomes impossible to continue building as you need to use the presets to place a piece before you can freeform it. This causes issues when your piece wants to dive underground, yet you wish to freeform it and keep it above ground.- Staff buildings, now some will say this really isn't an issue (and I agree to an extent) however, by making staff members simply components of the building we place we lose our abilities to both customize them and set specific routes for them, two things that were nice about RCTW's predecessors. I do like the idea of the staff buildings and it adds a little more realism, however; for it to work for me the same level of customizability present in its predecessors must also be available.- FPS drops, now I have a top of the line computer (one capable of running Fallout 4 on near maximum graphics settings) so running RCTW shouldn't be a problem for my computer AT ALL. Unfortunately the reality is that I'm plagued by random FPS drops and ""input lag"" at least 70% of the time I spend on this game. The worst part is that it happens in almost entirely empty parks - Atari you really need to work on this.- Lack of flat rides, I understand that this is an Early Release (alpha if you will) however it would be nice to have some more generic flat rides that aren't soo heavily themed. Perhaps an option to toggle what the ride's theme is? I'm not sure if anything will be done about this but if you're going for one specific theme your options are quite limited.- Scenery placement, all of the previous games had this issue as well. Planet Coaster is the only one I've seen that has done this right soo far. I'd love to see scenery that we can place anywhere so that we can properly theme rides/areas. What is the point of having a giant tree with a hole that looks as though you could run something through it if you can't put anything through it?- Lastly I'd like to say that I feel this game should be MUCH farther along than it currently is. No I do not know anything about video game developement and yes I know there were three developers working on this game. Nvizzio, if you're reading this please take what I've said and will continue to say as constructive criticism. I love the RCT series and I want to see this become a AAA title, but right now I see a game that is waiting to die upon release. RCTW was originally announced to release in Early 2015, it is now Early 2016, and we only have an Early Access. Slow and steady wins the race and making a quality project is 100% always better than rushing out unfinished garbage, however; I feel a year of delays for this game is enough. Nvizzio, Atari, this is crunch time. The community will not continue to stand for delays, you're already losing your fanbase to Planet Coaster. I'm not saying rush a finished project, I'm saying make sure you do this right in a timely fashion. The fan uproar that you see now and the fanbase's lack of faith in you is only the beginning if you really mess this one up.To conclude I would not recommend this game to anyone, not until some serious work is done. I will continue to mess around with it but I really doubt I will play this anywhere close to as much as I played the past three. If you want your money's worth now I'd buy Planet Coaster or Parkitect. Although honestly who knows, I have faith in the team at Nvizzio that they truely want to deliver a AAA title for us fans and I'm willing to ride the storm out and see where they take us.			"

												In short... A dissapointing let down and waste of money.I bought this game knowing that it was early access, but liked their vision for the game, enjoyed their previous RCT games and wanted to support them. I installed the game, played it for a little while and decided that it wasnt at a good enough stage yet, but left it like that, 3 months later, i did the same again... 4/5 times later i could see lots of room for improvement, especially alongside Planet Coaster.Then it happened... Planet coaster was coming close to it's release date, and the RCT:W devs had a panic... they'd spent so much time and money developing yet another game was coming that did it better. They had a decision to make, should they take their time, learn from others and fix their game? or should they do everything they can to rush an unfinished product to market in a bid to steal peoples money? Yep, you guessed it! they announced a release date a week prior to that of Planet coaster, and charged slightly less for the game.Having had the game in my library for so long with 8 hours played, im not entitled to a refund... Leaving me rather annoyed that my money has been stolen and my good will has been taken advantage of.I should have seen it coming really, they pretty much pulled the same move with TDU2. (Hype it up, release utter drivel, not give a crap)The only plus side is that they are trying to continue on with this title, so it could suddenly become a great game... and i could win the lottery.

												I bought this game 1st day of early access release. I purchased under the impression it would be several months while the developers released features and fixed bugs. During the almost 8 month wait, I believe 2 flat rides were released, and a few pieces of scenery. PxP was a huge step in the right direction & UGC is a fantastic feature. However 90% of the releases were bug fixes & updates.  I held my breath for the final release, but only to learn that they were releasing it a day earlier than Planet Coaster. Finally realease day, the game will no longer take 10 minutes to load a sandbox map!  I'm gonna be so excited for all the new rides and scenery & shops!!!........ But it was the exact same content as the early access, just the story mode changed. I dont care about story mode. I want a huge selection of flat rides, water rides, transport rides. It has none of that. Unless this game comes out with a release with a crapload of new rides and shops, I can't recommend it. The only thing this game has going for it is the UGC. I'm sorry, but Planet Coaster is what this game was supposed to be.  "

I wanted to make my own opinion, hoping this game would bring more original RCT-feels and nostalgia, however it does not. It just feels wrong all from the start. I tried it once or twice, not even immersing myself into the game fully because I completely lost interest. The game lacks soul. It stirs so far from the original series in a way I can't even comprehend. To me, it looked like Planet Coaster was ""too modern"" and complex in its design to bring that same feel, and I for some reason liked this game's graphics better? Now I can clearly see I made a mistake and it is the other way around. If you are like me, then remember the bad reviews are there for a reason, and not just because of some silly bugs (which, according to comments, are completely gamebreaking, however I did not play enough to see any bugs - I just didn't like the game enough on its own account).

								I cannot recommend this in its current state, and I fear I will never be able to recommend this. If you haven't bought this - don't until it gets better. Even though the game makers have said multiple times on the internet they are authorizing refunds throughout all of the Early Access period on Steam for people who preordered if they don't like the game, Steam Support is going to be nothing but unsupportive of you if you try to take advantage of this offer.On the game itself, the graphics are subpar, and honestly I would say they're on the level of RCT3. The coaster builder is everything but intuitive and easy, as you have to repeatedly try to make it work, lift hills are not automatic, there are endless ""special"" pieces that are only special in how massive and hard to make fit they are, etc. The paths are unuseable most times as they will not even connect where you want them to. I could go on but most other reviews do.Bottom line, only buy this game right now if you want to throw away $60.			"

												Bad game. Dont buy. This one not even was at gamescom.... Do yourself a favor, buy parkitect and planet coaster instead....## updated 2016/11/16Game is now ""full"" released and it is SAME CRAP!Worst Dev's EVER! Even worst than No Mans Sky or Cities XXL!!They don't listen to gamers communityThey dont accept negative criticsThey  ban for stating our opinionThey ban for criticizing the gameThe release of RCTW is same thing as EA no improvements no nothing!Bad graphics, bad support, bad updates, bad marketing, bad trailers, bad release.Go and get Planet Coaster instead or Parkitect - even this one, is loads of times better than RCTW.## UPDATED 2016/08/31 ##Tested latest pxp update, same crap.1200 peeps and the game still becomes unplayable and then crash consuming almost all memory in the system.Also Pxp is the crappy copy of the one in Planet Coaster.They even added the same stores style as planet coaster to build the custom shops / building.Also they have reserved a slot on track station exactly the same (at least the faded screenshot) as Planet Coaster.Again, DO NOT BUY THIS!! ALSO THE GRAPHICS = AAARRRRGGGGHHHHH!!!!! MY PRECIOUS DISK SPACE!DELETED FROM COMPUTER ONCE AGAIN!! ## UPDATED 2016/08/27 ##Transcript of a comment i made on this review to @Scoot_in_FL:All those who bought the early bird edition (alpha/beta access) of Planet Coaster, received 3 updates on alpha 2 (2.0 / 2.1 / 2.2 and 2.3) and along with all these 3 updates, new content, many stuff players were asking, and many fixes those players were reporting..all this on all the updates!Right now, we have the Alpha 3 (Planet Coaster), which has everything the RCTW, less memory leaks, 95% Stable, 99% Smooth plus tonns of many stuff!! On the first day of alpha 3 on steam, with workshop content semi-properly (but well) implemented, received the first hot-fix update!BEFORE the beta, Alpha 3 will receive more updates, more fixes, more hotfixes and possibily more content.On the betas the same, and finally on the Final Release Even more content that weren't presented to us on Alpha's!!! So yeah, withing 3 months you just received new content, new fixes, new updates, and many new stuff!!  "

Early Access Review
								As so many of my fellow millenials, I grew up with RCT in the late 90's and early 2000's. It is a great franchise and still loads of fun. All of you may know that the fourth installation in the series was avidly awaited by many a fan. After a troublesome development history, yesterday the game came out in early access. It is facing stiff competition from Planet Coaster and Parkitecht, so comparisons between the two are inevitable. Nevertheless, in the promo-video's, dev-diaries, etc, the devs vowed to come with something worthwhile.So what came of it? To put it bluntly: An unfinished, unpolished alpha-build that is rife with bugs. The potential is there, especially in the coaster builder, but the detail, the path-tool, the management-aspect, the graphics  and the camera-handling are far below par. It is essential that this is going to be adressed in the near future. The communication by the devs towards the coaster-community is in this regard not very encouraging. I think it is only fair that the devs have to come with an open and honest statement about the development stage and a feasible time schedule which lays out at what times what issues will be fixed and what kind of content will be added. RCT world has potential. If they get the coaster tool working in a proper way, it even has the potential to outshine Planet coaster in at least one regard. But so far, this product is not ready for sale and an embarrasment for the franchise. Let's hope that the devs will quickly do what needs to be done. Come clean to the fanbase and coaster community. Only then can they regain some credibility....			"

												I have been playing this game since day 1, and I put a lot of hopes into this one, as all of the game series is great.For a long time I even had this comment on positive - but today i have to change this. I am running this game on a brand new overclocked GTX1080. And still it lags. I guess that is all i have to say about the games performance. It fills up 8GB of VRAM, GPU Clock rises to ~2000Mhz and it still doesn't keep 60FPS in all game situations, especially with a lot of peeps in the park.Gameplay is...well it's okay. Not a lot of rides to chose from, but the community created decorations are cool. It would be an average game - but the weak performance destroyes everything.			"

								I have played all of the RCT Series, I enjoyed them all but I like RCT 1 our of the lot the best.RCTW for me is quite a disappointment from a technical stand point.Firstly the graphics are weak, Let down by poor quality textures, The world feels like it has no charm as the world lighting appears washed out.Building experience is more prefabricated than the original, You can't choose where to place entrances and exits but at least you can free rotate to any angle.Building paths is clunky and has annoying link snap points, its not true free form construction. I have not found it possible to place shops how I want at path edges and construct a plaza style area, they have to have short paths leading to them.While you can do curved paths, You annoyingly can't do curved queue's????...The coaster spline tool is quite good, However the tools feeding back Intensity, Nausea and Excitement data are very frustrating to work with. You have to open the ride and let it run to get the info, then close it again and make your adjustments rather than being able to get the data from a test run...Overall there a quite a few minor annoyances with this game that are just about enough to ruin the experience.

												For the love of all that is living please do your research on the other games in this genre that are being released. This game is an perfect example of a company that uses a well known name as a money grab. This game is NOT the successor to the old roller coaster tycoon games. If you're looking for the successor, check out parkitect or planet coaster depending on if you prefer rct2 or rct3 styled gameplay. The quality of the content in the game is horrendous. Core gamplay is broken such as the path system, terrain editing, and the peeps. The game is full of bugs and people working on the game fail to acknowledge the problems with this game let alone listen to their customers. This game is also terribly overpriced and is being marketed as a AAA game even though I've played much better indie games. Do not be fooled into buying this game and please do your research before deciding on this game. The steam reviews and Atari's lack of communicating with the community should speak for itself.Tldr: This game is very poorly made and is being falsely advertised as a good game. Do your research before buying this game.			"

								So far, the game feels incomplete. You can sense the power of the spline coaster-building system, but there are PLENTY of fixes that need done before this can be recommended.PEEP AI is horrible, as is their animation. They all seem like zombies. No animation. No character. PEEP thoughts does not seem to work.Should be able to hover over attraction and get information (i.e. number on ride; number in queue; wait time.)Should be able to right-click to remove an object when in build mode.Janitors and Mechanics seem brain dead. They walk past trash; they don't fix rides. Perhaps patrolling zones needs to return.All-in-all, having fun playing game with my 6-year-old son, but I think the game is far from complete. He thinks it's great and I guess that's all that counts.			"

Early Access Review
								This is the first review I have ever written. I am writing this while my refund is pending. RCTW has great potential to be an amazing game. After playing for a few hours and watching streams and such for a few hours, I can not recommend this game in it's current form. I have hope that the developer will turn this around. After watching the latest stream they did, i can see why RCTW is not a success. They have forgotten what it is about. They have forgotten what makes the RCT series great. They have forgotten it is about the roller coasters! After seeing some of the pre-built roller coasters that are available, I wonder if any of them have ever rode one. There were a few things that made me consider opting for the refund, and one thing in particular that lauched me out of the station. First, i tried to build a pretty common element on looping steel rollercoasters called a cobra roll. It is impossible. Well... i cant say impossible. If i wanted to spend hours trying to get it to work i probably could have made it work, but lets get real. Who wants to spend that amount of time on one element. Since the beginning of RCT time, you were able to build  a half loop into a left or right half corkscrew, then into the opposing corkscrew piece, and finally finish of with you second half loop. Now when i tried with the current iteration in the series, i did my half loop, then into a half cor... nope... no half corkscrew piece. Instead there were multiple corkscrews, and not even in the right direction. It was going up into the air, opposite direction and behind the half loop. Now you can do alot with RCTW's spline based coaster builder, but that was just rediculous. I ended up just doing a large loop and making a few other spaced out elements before returning the track to the station. The coaster ended up being well recieved by my parks patrons, but I was about to call my doctor to schedule chemo. So a couple of days later I had an idea. Im going to try to build one of my favorite roller coasters, Kennywood's Thunderbolt. How i have built recreations in the past, especially Kennywood coasters, is to build them on flat ground then save the blueprint. Then, dig a  hole in the ground since all of their coasters are hugging ravines. So as I finished and tested Thunderbolt-ish, i was getting excited to save and put my coaster in its final resting place. Instead i think i may have found RCTW's final resting place. When i was trying to lower i found that you simply cannot do that.it would not even go down till the bottom most piece of track was touching the ground. What the $@*&?!?! I was dumbfounded. I had no solution. Since i was already frustrated from trying to make the rollercoaster in the first place and just wanted to be done, i decided to just raise the terrain and say the heck with it. Cant do that either... all of the land where there were only supports would not level out with the rest. So i had holes in the ground everywhere there were supports. The list of obsenities that proceded from my mouth were many. So that was pretty much strike two. So a couple days later, I read that they are launching the game. I also read that there would be a live stream. I missed the live part, but did watch it a few days later. Nothing new. Same crap different version. They showed off that the peeps aren't skating across the ground anymore, the new ""campaign mode"", and more PxP. What the heck is PxP? Oh, that is the scenery. I swear if i hear them say peice by peice one more time imma kms. Like this is ROLLERCOASTER Tycoon... not Scenery Tycoon. So much emphasis has been placed on scenery while the fuctionality of simple things like rollercoasters and paths are put on the back burner. While watching the stream, seeing that woman force Daisy out, I said to myself, ""Yup... I'm done.""			"

								Let me start off by saying.. If you want to play the TRUE sequel of RCT3, buy Planet Coaster (Early Bird Alpha Edition). This is just ANOTHER ""Park Construction and Management Sim"" that got called RCTW. I'm not going to point out the reasons, if you don't believe me, patch your eye for 2 hours and try both games.Straight to the point..The Track Editor works well, with less than 5 minutes toying around you will be able to create smooth, visualy fluid and funny rides.No Transport Rides, no Mini Golf.. among others.There are some restrictions while placing scenary objects that sometimes can be a bit anoying.It is possible to make curved paths, to do them visualy pleasant is not that easy.Terraforming works like a charm.Textures are not impresive for a 2016 game.Peeps are not same we used to see in RCT3 which is the most iconic part of the game.As expected in Early Access, you will get some lag, random freeze.There is a lot of work to be done and i hope the game improves over time but for now is not possible to enjoy it.My advice: If you are a diehard RCT fan, please do you a favor and get Planet Coaster. If you just like Park Sims in general, you can also buy this one.. and cheaper than 50$.                    -------------------- EDIT 04/09/2016 ---------------------I'm going to follow the changes coming to the game until it's officially released, I'll change my review based on the final product.

												I would love to say that this is a brilliant sequel to the RCT franchise however I am left with only disappointment. It doesn't feel like a RCT game. It seems like this game has been built from scratch by people who haven't even played the previous RCT games. It's very clunky, load times are horrific, the peeps look and walk like they are half dead, all rides look like fair ground rides - not theme park rides, it's very awkward placing items and feels restrictive, buildings seem to large and generic looking, the Emojis above peeps are just awful and the game lacks loads of content for instance dark rides, water rides, track rides and other basic thrill rides. It feels like this game is half finished. It's most definitely not at a stage where it should be released. It's such a shame.			"

												Do not waste your money..I was the first on the band wagon. The frist day it was available I purchased this game over 8 month before the pre release....i kept following waiting for the game to be released as optimistic as possilble. I absolutely love the other RCT games 1,2 & yes even 3. But this game is a total disaster. It takes way to much effort to build anything in this game. The previous games were set up for you to build, manage, and watch your park grow. If you want build something here is the scenario...First you find where you want to position your item holding shift and scrolline your mouse to rotate the item (very time consuming)...then back out and go to destruction mode and delete trees....if the trees are in a field then you can use the mass delete. But if they are close to a path you must individaully click on each item(I scream everytime). Then go back to the buidling menu find your item again....reposition it where is was originally place the item. Then go to build a path....because its not grid based building paths are an extreme pain (not exagerating). I really want to know the thought process given to changing the way paths are built, it is because of this that I have hated this game from day 1.... It is just way to challenging to waste buildin paths. I did not purchase a $60 game to struggle with building sidewalks all day and yet that what I have done in this game.Next major issue is moving around in the game you must use w,q,e,s,d,z,x, to move in the game. or take you hand off the mouse and use the keyboard arrows. in order to change your angle holding control and moving the mouse. All this is way to time wasting. in previous editions a simple right click and moving mouse worked perfectly and would do the same here but this game is not about simplicity. I promise you that.The final straw for me...Today I clicked on a janitor to follow him around for a few seconds...but then couldn't stop following him....no matter what button I clicked or key I pressed I was locked into following the janitor. i had to save and quit the game then relaunch the game to go back and continue playing. This shows that after 3 years of building a game there are still major flaws that just make the game suck! Not to mention that after 3 years I still don't have a full game.....RCT World took the fun out of managing a theme park and instead just gives you something to struggle and get frustrated with. Nothing in this game is simple. Everything is very complex confusing and boring... Sorry RCT i will continue to play previous RCT games but this one is out. You failed majorly.			"

												Full disclosure, I will keep playing this game even after writing this horrible review. I promise to update it if I change my  mind on anything.I'm not looking for major innovation in this series addition. I liked these games a lot. So I bought it despite the poor reviews. Also was hoping the bugs had been fixed. This is HARDLY playable. There are early access games I have that have way less issues. Frequent crashing issues and no auto-save options (that I can find.... speaking of that the UI is horrible and not intuitive at all for an experience player of the original and an experienced player of current simliar style of game). The settings don't even appear to work... changing 'camera rotation speed' didn't seem to adjust anything. I tried turning down graphics settings to hopefully avoid the major graphic freak-outs that kept happening. Didn't help. Forcing the tutorial is a MISTAKE. Three missions in and I'm still on tutorial? If it's this long let me skip it. I'll come back if I get frustrated or confused. OR USE GOOGLE.Also important to note: I bought the DELUXE edition.

The Peeps in RCTW look constipated 24/7 I really honestly cannot recommend this GARBAGE to anyone, I've spent a better part of a year playing the early builds of Planet Coaster, even then it was LIGHTYEARS ahead... So either get PC or Parkitect... but DO NOT GET THIS GAME.... It's a Waste of money... The RCT brand has been tarnished forever... Thankfully Frontier Games made P.C.. The TRUE successor to RCT 3 & Theme Park (by BULLFROG) RCTW is more of a TABLET/mobile device game than a Computer game... it just feels CHEAP.			"

												--- DO NOT BUY ---From the earliest chance to play pre-release versions of both, RCTW looked worse than Planet Coaster by far. I did buy both though. Since Planet Coaster Alpha 3, I haven't touched RCTW except to see if they somehow fixed it yet (spoiler: yeah right)They really haven't fixed anything as far as i'm concerned - the peeps still look like they are supposed to be realistic, but instead land firmly in ""I asked a programming class to make animations of peeps, that should work, right?"". They glide along when you're zoomed out. They skip and run in unrealistic ways. There are not a lot of unique peeps, so they all look alike.The controls are unintuitive. The main menu screen is just ugly.I really don't have anything positive to say about RCTW.Buy Planet Coaster. It costs the same, and it's not only better - it's actually really a good game.Once again, ---DO NOT BUY RCTW---			"

								A lot of people have issues with details such as park management, mediocre graphics, horrible staff and peep AI, etc.I fully agree with these, but was able to look past this. For me, making free-form coasters was the absolute dream. I'm a bit of a coaster freak, and I finally had a chance to rebuild my favorite coasters around he world in my parks. I could not have been more hopeful, and after hours and hours of figuring out the finicky coaster building tool, I finally created an exact replica of El Toro at Six Flags. So when it had an intensity rating of 21.7, ultra-extreme, and no peeps would ride it, I was understandably disappointed. My next few attempts produced similar results, though they were all exact replicas or closely based off of many of the prominent coasters in the world today. To put hours into this difficult process only to have the majority of my peeps not ride it and a massive pile of vomit in my exits is, well, not good.Fine, gameplay mechanics be damned, I would do what I could do build an aethetically pleasing park incorporating realistic roller coasters. I put even more hours and hours into this process, only to have both the parks I built crash the game before being able to load. All of my time lost.Update after update promising updated coaster mechanics and improved realism and all we get is this bull. I wish I hadn't played this so much already so I could get my money back. A decade-long disappointment.			"

								I had high hopes for this game and waited a very long time to experience another rollercoaster tycoon game due to me being a big fan of the origional 3. Once beta of this game came out and all the negative publicity started, I thought for sure the developer would truly start caring about how to fix it and make it all that it could possibly be, especially with fierce competition from planet coaster (which I bought beta access for at the same time as buying RCT world). After playing both I was truly amazed at the level of complexity planet coaster gave it's peeps and the level of detail involved in the game even at such an early stage of developement. I unfortunately was not impressed with RCT world, I wanted to like it soo bad, I wanted to ignore the negative publicity it was getting and keep an open mind and stay positive about how this game could one day be truly amazing, but after the negative beta release which I figured would tighten up their boot straps, The game just doesn't deliver, especially at the cost their asking. I found pathways to be incredibly difficult to place, especially at the entrance of the park where nothing seems to connect, or connect straight for that matter. Also peeps look very bland, If you compare it to PC, its a no brainer, there was no time or thought put into peep movement, intelligence, or even just simple gestures. I found rollercoaster building to be fun and intuitive but when you finally finish the coaster and ride it, it studders and shakes on the track which gets annoying, which was also mentioned in a recent review video. The graphics seem so outdated and bland and when you zoom out the peeps skip frames as they walk and it looks terrible, BTW the graphics were cranked to max and i run dual R9 390x video cards in crossfire. The game may one day be extemely fun to play and easy to use, which i truly hope it is because I will definitely buy it again (I refunded it), but at this stage it is not worth the price tag and it seems the developer has not improved much since beta, so it's difficult to see this game improving from it's early access state, i truly hope I am wrong though. I would not recommend this game at this stage especially with planet coaster right around the corner and looking very promising, so far iv had nothing but fun with that game.			"

								I've been playing tycoon games, Sim games, pretty much any sandbox sim game I can get my hands on, keep that in mind as I rip into this game. I really wanted to like this game, because the orginal was fantastic, but I can't bring myself to give this game a thumbs up. I won't bother going into too much detail because there are plenty of people who have. The game is plauged with leaks, bugs and glitches and to make things worse the devs. push the blame off on to the player, as if it's our system and not their poor excuse for a tycoon game. It's not just that though, I have a top shelf graphics card and the game looks terrible, when you zoom out you can really tell how much time they DIDN'T take on the game. The ""peeps"" all have block heads and are emotionless, they move like a robot from the 1950's and noone travels the park in a group. building paths is a pain, getting paths to connect to rides or other paths (which is a huge part of the game) is next to impossible. The scenery looks like junk, flat flowers, no variety, lifeless tress, meaning they don't sway, no leafs blowing, nothing. the lack of detail is littered through out the game, from the peeps to the scenery, even the daylight/nighttime cycles look like they were made on a platform from 98'. I cannot stress how bad this game is, just because it's still in beta dosen't mean "" oh there might still be hope"" because this game is a disaster, so abandon all hope . This company and it's affilates will most likly take the money they've made off us suckers and walk. The devs are a trip and will give you a to do list in order to give you information that will be of no use, it's almost like they have no clue what they're doing and can't adress anything inparticular so they just flood you with a list of possible soultions to THEIR broken game, which in the end , like I said, will be of no use. Almost like they just have a copy and paste response, which I know what you're thinking"" of course"" but it's really bad, like toddlers made a game on dad's computer bad. This game has no bussiness even being for sale, making it free to play wouldn't help, the game in one word , SUCKS. I could go on to about the lack of effort, detail, time and money that went into this game but I think you get the point. I regret not reading the reveiws on this one but I suggest you keep reading them, you'll see my story matches up to almost everyone else. Save your money, this isn't the late and great rollercoaster tycoon game you kneww and loved, this is a cheap rip off and if I could I would give it 2 thumbs down.			"

								I'm going to keep this relatively brief - we've waited a LONG time for this game. The beta proved to be less than promising, but I stuck with it, with community and development managers assuring us the game was shaping up and nearly ready for release. For this to be cited as a 80% complete is insulting. The only correlation between this and RCT3 is the change of numbers - it's nowhere near on the same par with regards to content, graphics (for the time of release!), and playability. I'd recommend Googling some of the play throughs before making a purchase. Unless of course... you're into this kind of thing! Save yourself some money!!			"

								Never will i buy a game from Atari anymore. This is bull****!! People please read...The frames drop even harder than a bowling bawl tossed out of a window!! Not even a steady 30FPS on medium graphics. And that with a i7-3770K 16GB Memmory, 256GB SSD and a AMD Radeon R9 290X graphics card. Then they tried to make the visitors smarter by making their own choices and going directly to the thing they need. So if they are hungry, they would go to a stand for food. If they needed to go to the toilet, they would go to the toilet. Well i think that the one who wrote this system for RCT World was a very very drunk man. The system fails in every way. Even the waiting lines are bugged. People tend to stay halfway the waiting line and dont walk on.Then the coaster building... Luckily they kept some off the old handelings because building with the mouse is not done! And here is the way you build a couster who is actually fun to ride:* Build a coaster* Destroy the coaster * Go on the ferris wheelAnd then, omg are the rides made of plastic? Every ride i build got broken within a few minutes real time. I allmost got up to 30 mechanics for 20 rides and still they got broken and could not be fixxed fast.This is my first time writing a review. Most of the time i think the people will get it if a game is bad or even worse. But such a big name as RCT... What a fail... If you want to spend money on a park building game, go to Planet Coaster. It costs a little more to help the developers ( like € 64,95 ), but than you have a great park building game with great looking graphics and a really good engine.			"

								Loving the RCT Franchise I have tried to give this game a fighting chance so here we go...The game itself feels very Amateur-like. The colors are all off. I boosted the gfx up with a quard core, 16gb ram and gtx 1070, still feels like I bought this game from 2004. There is alot of lag I began to add more features in the park.Audio is horrible and average at most.The animations of the peeps are just awful.. complete garbage. It looks as if a 12 year old learning 3D Studio max made all the peep animations. Its just terrible. This right here practically does it for me because the whole purpose of this game is to make rides and attractions based around these peeps...Knowing the Frontier made RCT3 and did a great job with it even though it was a bit caroon-ish.. I  would say to stick with the company that knows how to make theme park based simulation games. This new developer is definately trying, i'll give them that but they are way out of their league. Not sure anyone will read this but if you do, go on youtube and watch gameplay from this game (RCTW) and Planet Coaster (made by frontier).. You decided which is better which should be completely obvious..Don't waste your money on this game, it is NOT worth $60.. At most its worth maybe $5Conclusion:GFX = 2004 based (garbage)Audio = AverageAnimations = PoorBugs = LOTSGameplay = Average (boring)Go buy PLANET COASTER			"

								Well they pushed the release date back about 4 times before we got the general Q1 2016 release date, which i thought for sure was them trying to hide that they had killed the game in production. I played the game during the first Beta weekend and it looks like they just added in the peep textures, a couple flat rides, and just released it again. There is a metric ton of stuff missing, and menus and buttons are still in weird places, And seeing as this was going to originally release in December 2015 this is unexceptionable. I mean fence builder was the biggest complaint from the First public beta and guess what...There is still no sign of it in the game other then on a to-do list on their website somewhere. This is still a beta build, but for how long they have pushed this game back you think there would be more than 10 coaster types or even building for that matter.I think they tried to get the jump on the market by trying to release the game a year early. Even if you ignore how ridiculously bugging it is then its still missing content. Stock RCT3 Had more content at launch then this game does 4 months after it original launch date and multiple betas. Most of these complaints are about the studio behind this game and how poor their development cycle is if this is all they have to show for multiple missed release dates and multiple open closed betas.

Early Access Review
								I must admit that, in general, I am disappointed with the game so far. I understand it is still in Early Access and I'll still give it a chance to fix its problems until the full release, but it is definitely not what I was expecting given that I've been playing Roller Coaster Tycoon games ever since the original in the 1990s. Still, I'll try to list my impressions about the game as unbiasedly as humanly possible.I really like the interface. It's simple, it's clean, it's modern and it's elegant. It's refreshing to see a modern take on an interface when, even today, most games still go with tacky and bulky interface designs. Pathing needs a lot of work and I'm finding it really hard to get my paths to be how they I want them to be. It's pretty hard to get nice, snaking queues, for instance. The graphics are okay. Not great, but not horrible. But then again, I think graphics are the least important thing in a game. While in some cases quirky graphics may contribute to ambiance, in most games graphics just don't matter and RCT games are games where it doesn't matter, imo. I actually really like the coaster editor. It's a pretty powerful tool once you get used to it. Staff control is very basic at this point and could use improvement. I'm not the best guy to really assess performance as my computer is already somewhat outdated at this point in time, but I feel it could be better. Considering I can play XCOM 2 with acceptable framerates in a medium graphics setting, I was expecting to run RCTW more smoothly than I do. In particular, loading times seem to be particularly slow on my machine and I've had a few crashes when loading Scenarios.To sum it up, in its current state, RCTW still has a lot of issues. It has good points and bad points and, while I am willing to wait and see if the issues will be fixed in future versions of the game, I can't really recommend it in its current state.			"

Two times now?The mechanics never seem to actually even do anything, the rides constantly break down despite best efforts, the peeps apparently can never find restrooms despite the numorous amounts sprinkled around the tiny park.I would like to recommend it, it does have it's moments but it's current state is abysmal.

								I cannot recommend this game in its current state, it's an enjoyable game while it works despite the issues some people have raised about not being able to place paths squarely on the grid etc. As well as bad graphics and some of the more humorous visual bugs I have encountered like one of my park visitors getting stuck underground after riding the slide - I can look past these things.Some of the issues I have encountered however are just completely game breaking, for example; After building my first coaster and testing it, I opened it up for the peeps, they began to queue but nobody was getting on the ride, I tried closing it down and opening it again to see if that helped and while at first it seemed to, once the first load of peeps had finished riding it, they refused to get off. I then tried to edit the coaster to see if i could spot any obvious issues that might be causing this which turned out to be a bad idea because after doing so EVERYBODY in my park started glitching out on the spot and couldn't move.I appreciate that it is an early access game and I will look into posting the bugs I have encountered but really for £29.99 the game should at least be in a playable state.

Early Access Review
								I was really excited for this game to launch, it was actually really big disappointment. The graphics look horrid and so do the maps, the grass and trees look neon green and ugly/unrealistic.  This is also very laggy on my 3.5 ghz computer. I was all hyped for this, but it made me like Roller Coaster Tycoon 2/3 better. Seems like very little effort has been part into this game even though the game has been delayed a long time.			"

								As a die hard fan of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series I was extremely excited to try out the latest installment in the series. I avoided the reviews and Lets Plays on youtube purposely so that I could judge the game by its merits alone. That being said, there is unfortunately a lot wrong with the game. The path system is a disaster and half the time it refuses to let me place paths in places that are unobstructed. The peeps are completely lifeless while they are on rides and you can watch them cycle through various terrifying facial expressions while remaining dead silent the entire time. (Its honestly only a bad soundtrack away from being a horror movie.) Perhaps this is just a glitch on my end, but half the time buildings and rides don't actually show you whether or not they are closed which led me to accidentally forget to open half the stuff in my park. (Oops!) I also noticed that the days seemed... Shorter? Like, almost ridiculously short. I feel like they could be slightly longer. In order to see my park at night I have to lock the time set to night time or else you'd miss it if you looked away for two seconds. There are so many little things that could be fine tuned, that would make this such a great game. I want to like this game so bad because a huge chunk of my childhood was spent playing both RCT2 and RCT3. RCTW is just not holding up compared to even RCT3. I'm hoping the developers really are serious about improving the game because it has so much potential. Until then, I cannot recommend it.			"

												Well, this game is awesome at first but then after you play it and your park grows, it just slows down and more uptil it started to froze in the midsit of expanding my park which lost my progress. I was pretty upset after this.I really hope they'll improve the performance of the game as well, espically on a high end computer, it still lags or frezzes, espcailly other reviews that have mentioned this, yes it's true.The developers needs to focus on the performance of this game if your going to demostrate a great franishce. Gee, why is some franchises gets bad and even worst in this age.Well, I'll head back to RCT Classic!			"

												I want to get a time machine so I can go back in time and slap myself for buying this. This game is bland. There is no fun to be had. I've played hours of this and only the first 30 minutes(The ones filled with false hope and lying to myself) were fun. I was going to make a YouTube video about this but 15 minutes into it, I just felt dead inside. This is a shell of a game that could have been something and became the same thing it's been since announcement. A polished tin can with nothing in it to eat. A bland oatmeal of a game. It's like eating cardboard. A peanut without the nut. Those presents under the Christmas displays that you want to open but know they're empty. RollerCoaster Tycoon World.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is far from finished. It's so far from finished that I can't believe they're saying it's full featured enough and they're just releasing the base game so they can add more features later on. No, the serious problem here is that the base features that are available right now just plainly don't work, and even some simple things just don't exist (you have zero control over staff, for example). I can see the potential here, but so much stuff is just so broken. The real redeeming quality of this game is the coaster builder, but just about everything else doesn't seem to work. I'm so glad the devs decided to dump this into Early Access, because otherwise I would've felt so betrayed. I still feeled betrayed though, by the high price for such an unfinished game. I really hope the developers get their act together. I could barely even start my park because I spent like 30 minutes trying to understand the convuluted and idiotic path building system, and my paths still look awful. Even the wonderful coaster editor needs some polishing, it doesn't really give me enough realtime information and my coasters kept flying off the track.Here's my first look at the game:  


YouTube™ Video: Rollercoaster Tycoon World | Ep. 1 | Rings Of Disappoint | Early Access Gameplay 

			Views: 247		

			A first look at Rollercoaster Tycoon World, a somewhat disappointing, yet fun sequel to the fan favorite Rollercoaster Tycoon series.		

 Clearly I wasn't in the correct mindset to be playing a buggy game (yeah let's play what is essentially an alpha right after major surgery), but at the same time this game is barely even ready for Early Access. I continued that first look with a video dedicated to the wonderful coaster editor here: 


YouTube™ Video: Rollercoaster Tycoon World | Ep. 2 | The Unexciting Puke Machine | Early Access Gameplay 

			Views: 146		

			My mouth was still full of gauze for this, but here's what happens when you just try to build a rollercoaster in RCTW. The builder is impressive, the execution...well you can see how that went.		

 . It still needs work, unfortunately, I was really hoping that it was going to work out of the gate. It IS fun though, but you generally end up making puke machines that rate low on the in-game excitement scale. Would I recommend this game to friends? Not right now. Would I maybe recommend this game to friends in the future? Probably, as I feel like there's a lot of potential for this to be a modern version of the first three RCT games. Will this game ever be worth $50-60? No, probably not. You guys are reeaaaally pushing it with that price point, I would probably pay max $30-40 for this, even if it were full-featured and polished.			"

								The RCT series has been one of my favorite simulation game series for a long time. I was ecstatic when I heard this game was coming out and preordered it....a year ago. Now fast forward a bit after the two messy beta weekends where the game was nowhere near completion. Then when the game was delayed from December (I think), I sent out a refund request to Atari so that I could get my money back for the many disappointments and they started to work with me. After giving them my receipt information like they requested...I didn't hear back for weeks, I sent in another request to get my money back and nothing. I figure it's because they knew the game would be releasing soon...and a few days later, they released that it would come out on March 31st. So, whatever, I am abandon my refund request cause what the hell. And then I play this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I know its still early access but come on everyone. This game barely runs and I have a nice enough rig to play Fallout 4, GTA V, Borderlans Pre Sequel, and Skyrim all out high to intense graphic settings with no problem. This? The FPS drops to around 15-20 when more than 2 rides are placed, or I'm building something, or a significant amount of peeps enter the park. This is early access, but this is not okay. This game should be able to do the basic things, and it just doesn't deliver. I will review this game again once it gets out of early access, but for now I am done wasting my time on this.			"

								I'm glad I got this game for free from a friend who got two keys bundled in some hardware or software or something, I don't remember. He, however, remembered that I've always been a huge RCT3 fan since 2005 and I still play that game to this day. It's just a colorful pleasure every time.THIS game... well... let's first get the most important thing out of the way:DO NOT BUY THIS GAME for the current asking price of 46 Euros!!I understand that many want to support these developer but... seriously... if they DARE to throw this game on Steam in THIS state, they don't seem to care about it all that much anyway. I for one don't expect them to really put any true passion in this product anymore. I do realize that they've called it ""Early Access"" now, but that's only because they've realized (by having that beta event) that their customers can't be deceived that easily and immediately called them out on HOW unfinished the game really is. This game should get MANY more months of thorough development and quality assurance and could then be released. Everything else is just BS, if you ask me.Remeber the feeling of playing the old RCT trilogy? How much fun it was to enjoy many hours in that colorful, sunlit atmosphere, just watching the park visitors laugh, kiss, play and have fun? How well-rounded it all felt? The friendly and yet functional interface, the music, the whole look and feel?That's all gone now.The people in this game look like hideous soulless creatures. The last time I saw such an atrocious design of humans was in Egosoft's ""X Rebirth"" (remember those grandmas?). They're just uncomfortable to look at. (So that's why they never showed the peeps' faces in their official trailer/making of videos...)The interface looks like a gray, neutral, managerial iPod-like interface. COMPLETELY devoid of color. Just gray with white lines. Yeah, that just screams ""fun"", doesn't it?The terrain in this game manages to instantly disappoint. Really. Disappointment at first sight. And even when you've started building and embellishing your park... it STILL looks cold and bare. Hard edges everywhere and with a strangely gloomy lighting.In the previous games you looked at the empty terrain and the colorful interface and you wanted to dive in!In THIS game, you instead feel an urge to quickly build *SOMETHING* in order to fend off the depressing atmosphere.There are countless comfortable options that are left out. Filtering your available structures by theme, to just name one.I just feel sorry for Nvizzio.Atari has become a disgusting publisher, really, which became painfully evident by their recent trainwrecks ""Alone in the Dark: Illumination"", ""Asteroids: Outpost"", ""Haunted House: Cryptic Graves"" and the ridiculous mobile cashgrab freemium ""game"" titled ""Rollercoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile"". Recycling titles of popular (sometimes iconic) franchises and churning out utter garbage.Seriously... until ""Planet Coaster"" by Frontier Developments (the original creators of the RCT series) is out, just stick to RCT3 Deluxe. ""Rollercoaster Tycoon World"" just isn't worth your time so far. It might be when it's finished, but it's FAR from finished at this point.			"

Early Access Review
								Iv played early access games before - knew what to expectIv played Pre-Beta/Alpha games before - knew what to expectThis however is on a different level.  It feels like maybe this was either the 3rd or 4th time the code was ever compiled and somehow ended up on steam for purchase.I quit playing after I bought a premade coaster, placed it, and then wasnt allowed to open it to the park guests becuase I didnt have the funds.  I sat around for a bit thinking that maybe I had missed something, but I didnt, and when I stared the game back up I was able to open the ride for business, which being the most gentle coaster somehow had ride intensity pegged as high as it could go, which in turn made all the patrons that rode the ride puke as soon as they hit the walkway, I watched this go on for about 5 minutes.  Built some janitor building to deal with that mess.  Low and behold the janitors were all broomless chicks in blue jumpsuits floating around moving their arms back and forth.The only positive is that steam was very prompt on refunding my money, very pleased about that.

								There are too many issues at this time for me to say ""Buy this game"".Shame, as it does remind me of the RCT2 vibe.Problems I faced:- Scenario had parameters which I couldn't find out. You tell me you need $18 spend a head, then show how much I currently have.- Any changes I make to the theme park took too long for them to be useful for the scenario. I built a coaster in Jan of the scenario by game end only 5 people had ridden it. Thus a waste of $15k.- The graphic look very ordinary, I feel saying it in on par with the RTC3 graphics (a game that is old, very old)The game has a lot of positives but currently they are outwayed by the negatives.

I get it, you don't want to turn off your core audience with changes to classic features they loved, but you added nothing content based that increased the play value.

								It's not that the game is frustrating, it's just boring. I had no joy playing it. I was tempted to say bureaucrats created this game, yet it's a really bad management game.Coasters, in RCTW, makes less revenue then the Bull ride!Coasters don't justify the investment, yet they're the whole point of the game...You have no control and therefore no idea which part of the park is covered by the staff.You need an Info boot every 2 rides, if not peeps get lost...You cannot set a range of prices for shops.Only food shops make revenue, gift shops are usuless... (Theses guys haven't heard of Disney)You have to set prices at each shop INDIVIDUALLY.Park land has the potential to be huge, yet you have very few rides to choose from.The peeps are soo skinny/small, you can't distinguish one from the other.No auto-delete when building rides.I could go on, but this game is not even able to cover the basic stuff we liked in RCT3.Pros : Ease of Path and coaster building.P.S.: This game will suck your PC dry. I have a powerful game PC and yet it often froze.			"

								To begin with, I didn't read the reviews first so my point of view wasn't tainted right off the bat. Honestly though this game doesn't live up to the franchise. The graphics are better than RTC3, but not 8 years better. The motion of the rides and peeps is not smooth. The graphics appear more cartoonish, less realistic. The game frequently hangs up or freezes and it loads very slow. Not nearly as many options as previous versions (ie no transit rides). The curved pathways are neat, but nothing lines up properly when using those tools (hedges and fences don't follow curves). Hedge and fence pieces are all one length, which leaves gaps. Limited tree options and no bushes. Peep movements are not natural, nor is their vomiting habits and urinating on the pathways (seriously?) I could go on and on. I want to like it, because I loved RTC 2 and 3, but it just is not there. I realize this is early access and I think the devs can fix many of the problems, but I don't see them going back and redesigning all of the graphics to the level you might expect them to be for a game created in 2015-2016. They really have a lot of work to do, and as loyal as I am to the franchise I don't see them pulling it off properly.

												This game is really pretty, but I honestly can't recommend it. And yes, I realize that it's an early beta for the roller coaster builder. But the roller coaster builder (the core of the game) is absolutely broken. I wanted so badly to like it.While the spline editor is a great idea, it just doesn't work in any feasible way. You'll pull out your hair trying to refine anything, and forget about making straight track. The result is an ugly, unrealistic, gangly, and awkward roller coaster that takes up way too much space and barely runs. There's no precision and the controls are so touchy that you'll find yourself screaming at your computer. Skill aside, it shouldn't take over an hour to lay down a lift hill--only to have the train randomly crash on a simple and shallow (forced by the game) pre-lift drop.Please delay the full release of this game. Go back to the drawing board. Try compromising the spline editor with the piece-by-piece system to allow for the compact and interesting coasters the franchise is known for while keeping the smoother rides.			"

								Just some initial observations when I loaded sandbox.  Can't move around with the mouse, one arrows or WASD.  What year is it again?The sandbox map I chose was very small.  Much smaller than RCT3 maps.    The graphics look fine and that was on medium settings.  Anyone that says they are the same as RCT3 is either lying or just trying to keep people from buying this out of spite because they're butthurt.  Steam has a generous refund policy.  Use it if you don't like it.  Too unfinished for me to enjoy now.  Would rather play RCT3 until this one gets better.I think this will be a great game in 2017, but I would not recommend it now.			"

								Almost had the early access version for 48 hours, and still haven't been able to play. The game still crashes at 57%, but i believe the producers are sorting this.I understand the reasons to release an early access version, but in doing this the quality of the product tends to suffer. They are always either glitchy, incomplete or simply unplayable. I should be able to at least play the game, and give it a fair assessment based on the in-game play. Very disappointed.			"

								Five months into Early Access and the paths are STILL a buggy mess, park visitors STILL glitch through things and float above paths, the major FPS drops are STILL rampant and the game will STILL freak the f*ck out once your park reaches a certain size. Not to mention the sore lack of variety in attractions and items, which I'm guessing they're relying on what little playerbase they have left to create themselves.Charging £29.99 vanilla for this is insulting. I wish I'd had the foresight to refund this mess of a game before I'd played 2 hours instead of attempting to continue to play, naively expecting it to become playable in the near future. "

								Alright after reading through some reviews that were negative and searching for the positive ones to no real good avail I have decided to write my review. YES this game has the Roller Coaster Tycoon title but does it really feel like the RCT we know and love? Not really to be completely honest. I was so excited for this game to release and my s/o was generous enough to buy it for me when it was available for purchase so I didnt really spend my OWN money on it. But I do feel for those who did pay for it themselves with their OWN money. I have enjoyed the game so far to a point but I have run into a few issues and these are kind of major ones.Coaster Customizations:This is a big one for me! I absolutely love building and designing my own coasters and I figured this point to point style system of building would lead to some REALLY cool coasters. And although it is a very useful thing its a bit confusing at first to use. But what I was really disappointed in is that there is a lack of pre-set parts for the coasters such as loops, corkscrews and twists. Yes they have some but then when you do use them they seem to have messed with the coaster a bit and changes the way it works entirely. Another complaint with the coaster builder that has REALLY frusterated me is how the BRAKES SYSTEM doesnt seem to WORK PROPERLY (at least for me) now it may be something that I am doing wrong but I get to a point where I want to have the ""Block Breaks"" so I can add a stop point for a second coaster to pause at while the other coaster is at the station. Ive done it in 2 and 3 plenty of times. But when I test the coaster it seems to give me the error that the ""Coaster did not complete its circut"" and then the second caoster never takes off? This is really weird to me and would like a bit of an easier block break system.The final thing with the coasters and really the rides overall is that you cant really customize them too much. Like for example; you can change the colors of the tracks but you cant really fully customize the train cars, you have preset trains available. But I would like to see the ability to add patterns and change individual colors on the trians. Maybe instead of the individual color boxes you can choose, try implementing a COLOR WHEEL with ALL the RGB colors on them?Scenery options are a bit of a disappointment not much able to mess with there.ALSO THE BIGGEST ISSUE I AM HAVING IS A HUGE ISSUE WITH MY MEMORY RUNNING LOW WHILE PLAYING THE GAME FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR!!I have 8GB of Corsair Vengance RAM DDR3 1600MHz and IDK WHY I am getting the error that my computer is running out of memory....Thats really all the issues I have with this game. I like it when it works, but it needs some fixing. I would recommend the game but not at this current time.			"

												Ok, what can I say about this game? I was really trying to believe in RCTW because its good potential. But there's a lot of bugs and sometimes I just can't play the game because it crashes on a gameplay several times. After the last update, the game now crashes into the loading screem (after leaving my game to the main menu) and the trees textures are horrible. I'm really sad to do that because I believed this project could evolve to something really good, but I was wrong... so i will not recommend this game at all. Here in Brazil, Planet Coaster is a little expensive but I will wait for a good discount for this game because Roller Coaster Tycoon World is a disappointing surprise...			"

												It's not as good as previous rollercoaster tycoon titles, and having played the other rollercoaster tycoon titles, i'm just not digging the way this one is played. I prefered the multitude of different shops and rides over the rather limited selection in Rollercoaster tycoon world. Where i spent hours developing the parks in the other titles, and customizing them the way i want to, and can take my time getting challenges done, some of the challenges/missions in this game are either too hard or too quickly over, and the game time per map/park is rather limited timewise, you just can't spend as much time on it. I found the maps for each park are rather limiting as well.			"

								Review for RCTW Beta Weekend One (10/30/15)The newest Rollercoaster Tycoon game in the series!-Please note before reading, remember that the purpose of this beta was, ""to test out the key features of the coaster builder and associated systems"" (RCTW Blog #22) -This beta is not going to represent what the entire final product is going to be, it will change overtime with feedback from us, the community, until RCTW Beta Weekend Two rolls around! Please read the entire review to know why I don't reccomend this at this current moment.-General OverviewLikes:- Path customization- Good variety of pathways and scenery in general for beta.- Water physics- Terrain Deformation tools- Good looking UI- Guests were spooky ghosts only for a limited time since it Halloween is approaching as I am typing this.Dislikes:- Crashing!- Takes ages to recover from a crash.- No options to change settings such as audio, graphics, etc in the beta.- No snapping to objects like fences to make placement faster- No grid!- Can't remove added trains when customizing coaster.- Framerate is all over the place.- No tutorial!Noticed Bugs:- When doing something else on your PC while RCTW is loading, the game tends to crash. (e.g. opening steam overlay, leaving window.)- Once placing station and forced to edit the coaster, when accidently exiting before placing a track and going back to edit wont allow you to place any track and gives you an ""Invalid Location!"" error.- Tons of black little dots appear on the main menu sometimes.Summary     Honestly, I felt kind of dissapointed with the beta. But don't get me wrong, this game has major potential to be something big and unique but at the current stance of the beta, I'm kind of iffy on what was only given to us to provide feedback. But anyways, the beta included great elements in the coaster builder which included a lot more coaster customization when laying out the tracks. It didn't feel like it was only a set of pre-modeled tracks and looked like it gave peeps whiplash when making tilted turns (like in rct3) and allowed me to make smooth, curvy tracks. The only thing that gave me a problem in the coaster builder is that there was no way to remove added carts! This is a major key feature in the coaster builder! But if there was a way to remove carts, feel free to correct me.     The pathway design improved a lot since the previous RCT game. Now there is the ability to make curved paths which is fantastic, and also realistic! There was also a variety of pathways to choose from and also had different sizes which allowed a lot more customization to the game. Not only there was a variety of pathways, but also a variety of scenery to decorate your park. This included many lampposts, benches, trees, etc to use! And to even add onto that, the Terrain Deformation Tool allows you to customize your park with pretty, vibrant hills with also the use of the terrain sprayer. It also included a water tool to make lakes or ponds.     Now don't think the beta was all fine and dandy! There was also many things that I was dissapointed about which was the lack of a tutorial, which pretty much there to show you how to play. It was pretty much get into the game and figure out what to do. Although it did not take long, I eventually figured out some of the controls. And one thing that bugged me the most was the placement of pathways, stations, and scenery since there was no grid to make things neat. It also helps alot when creating straight pathways. Also the game pretty much crashed a lot in the loading screens, framerate was all over the place, and there was no options to customize your game. Hopefully this will get added soon for the second beta!But yeah, to conclude this review, I do not reccomend this game yet because it can go either way. It could go terrific or can go bad. If you are really considering, I reccomend it if you are a fan of the RCT series like me, and support the developers of the game and provide tons of feedback for them to read!			"

Now that I got it to work, there is about a 3-5 second delay with every action once a campaign starts (and the graphics look worse than the first RTC). I've tried re-installing it but it's exactly the same.You know what makes the game unplayable though? Having to delete every single peace of shrubbery individually.			"

								I have been a dedicated player of Roller Coaster Tycoon since it first came out and that is why I thought that Roller Coaster Tycoon World would be such a great game.  After over 200 hours of working on a park and trying out the various features of the game I found I did not like it as much as the previous version.  The game is too glitchy, for example the new path system that is supposed to allow you to have customized paths will not allow you to make some connections with other paths.  The new piece by piece building feature is a nice touch, but if you decide to rotate the building, or move it, any shops you have built inside will get thrown out of alignment.  I was very excited today to learn that the game will be fully released on 11/16, the article had mentioned it's releawse date is a day before Planet Coaster.  Being curious I decided to try out Planet Coaster and I am now regretting the money I spent on Roller Coaster Tycoon.  Planet Coaster has incredible graphics, the rides are incredibly easy to design and build, and their path system truly does allow you to design and connect the paths the way you want.  I got more enjoyment out of 2 hours of messing around with Planet Coaster than I did with 200+ hours of Roller Coaster Tycoon World.			"

								Don't waste your money! This game is just bad in every way; everything is buggy! The options are limited; a choice of three world types, limited coaster designs, limited flat rides and limited stalls. One really stupid thing about this game is the lack of control! When placing staff buildings, you don't really have control over any of them like you could in RCT3. If you're a big RCT fan, and looking for 'RCT4', don't get this game. It isn;t even in the same league as RCT3. Just go and pre-order Planet Coaster (made by the same people as RCT3). Just look at some of the Youtube Videos from the early Alpha! It's miles ahead of this game! And it's £10 cheaper. Just DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this game!			"

												This is more of a ""thumbs in the middle, leaning up"" recommendation. I, like most other people reviewing the beta, grew up with the first two games, and still play them to this day. Pros:+Terrain editing and manipulation is FANTASTIC. Very easy to use and navigate, much more so than any of the previous games. Creating valleys, hills, mountains, holes, etc. is super easy and intuitive, and the water tool is much simpler than in previous games. +Pathing is also a huge improvement in RCTW. You can change the size of paths, as well as create curved paths. Much easier and less tedious to lay down as well. +Game itself is very pretty to look at. +Camera works like RCT3, a positive in my eyes. +I don't hate the coaster editor like some other reviews have stated. To be fair, I rarely messed around with it in the previous games. I'm not creative or talented enough to create anything worthy of laying down in a park, so I always relied on pre-built designs and online downloads for my coaster needs. That said, I found it simple enough to use after getting through a relatively steep learning curve. My biggest complaint with it is that the mouse sensitivity is too high, but I'm assuming (hoping) that we will have the option to tone it down upon release. Cons:-Physics seem way, way off. Coasters seem much too slow, and coaster stats appear to be questionable at best. -Time passes, way, way too fast. An in-game day goes by in what seems like 15 seconds, even on the slowest setting. -Everything seems too ""big"". This is a difficult one to explain. -This seems like a game that is six months to a year from release, not one a month and a half away. Menus are basic and ugly to look at, there are very, very few decoration items (assuming that there will be mcuh more at release), and descriptive text in menus is completely missing, or occupied by generic placeholder text.

Early Access Review
								I'm nearly 39 years old and as a father of two young children I don't get to play too many PC games from my youth, but there are a few that I've waited many of years to play...RCT and Sim City being the priorities.  After the horrible Sim City release, I said I would never buy another game from EA and now Atari has done the same to the RCT series with World.  I'm not sure who they are hiring to program these games anymore (cheapest folks I guess) but I'm in complete shock at the condition/state of this game (early access aside).  Before these games get issued to the public the CEO should play for at least 2 hours because I can't imagine any CEO who cares about quality or name recognition would consider releasing a game in the current state of RCTW.  If possible, I would hope Atari would just scrap this game and provide an amazing update of new props, flat rides and coasters, etc. for folks to incorporate into the existing RCT3 (please consider).    My experience with the current state of World:  Load the game / before entering into a scenario or sandbox choose the quit button - a pop up appears and asks ""would you like to quit game"" - Choose Quit - pop up disappears and takes you back to the main menu without quitting game.  The stinking main menu doesn't even work.  Nothing works. The limited coasters in early access don't line up very easily and each one I built had major graphical issues of all types, the paths are a complete and utter joke, the paint colors (only 4) have one for sand that is a dark brown vs. white (labeled wrong I guess), the sandbox mode has no empty base map so plan on spending 2 hours deleting/leveling before you can even use the sandbox, very limited on flat rides and coasters, options to tweak them is null to very limited - flat rides are a joke (look cool) but not useful for designing into a realistic/personalized park due to the art designs incorporated into them, peeps walk on and through just about anything including thru fencing, landscaping, etc.  I'm just livid that another favorite game from my youth has been completely and utterly destroyed to the point of which you know another release will never happen.  Sorry - but I find it shocking that PC Game Makers like Atari can't build a game better then what it was a decade earlier...I guess the end of PC games is just around the corner. "

												This game is a HUGE let down for the amazing RollerCoaster Tycoon series. Don't waste your money on it. The game is broken, runs badly is a let down to rct fans.UPDATE:If you are looking for a good, fun and enjoyable theme park tycoon game, check out Planet Coaster!(I do not work for Planet Coaster, I just think you will enjoy that game more than this one)If you are still tempted on buying the game, Check out this review by Lazy Game Reviews, it's helpful and should let you know about buying the game for yourself:

								I love this game. Very fun and addictive, but being early access it just isn't ready. I was fine with the game occasionally freezing up until it froze during the middle of my save. I lost all of my game play because it didn't save properly. Now I have to completely start over which is beyond frustrating. Wait until the glitches are fixed to buy this.Update:I tried to start another game, and it froze AGAIN while I was in the middle of saving. I lost yet another park that I built, and my park was worth over $30,000 at this point. I'm doing playing until this is fixed.			"

								Controls are cumbersome, it crashes frequently, and has none of the feel the previous games had. I dont know how they managed to do it, but they put out a game in 2016 that is inferior in nearly every way to its 15yr old predesessor. And please do not give me any crap about it being early acsess. The game was due for a full release six monthes ago. Atari screwed the pooch when they hired a new company to build it instead of using the company they had used before. Every indication shows that previous company is now making a new game that will blow this piece of crap out of the water.			"

								It really bums me out to write this review.Let me start by telling you the blame for this fiasco is squarely on Atari. They hired a studio that had no reputation to build the game originally. They wasted a lot of time and money and didn't have anything to show for it.Since Atari brought Nvizzio on to finish the game, huge improvements were made in short amount of time. I have a lot of respect for the hard work Nvizzio is doing.Still, Atari set horrible expectation during the whole process and they've not done a great job of communicating with people following the progress of this game. I'm fairly against pre-ordering games, but after the progress I saw Nvizzio making I decided to pre-order to show my support. They didn't deliver on any of the pre-order perks and went silent again for months. Until today.Now the game is releasing in Early Access, which I'm typically a fan of, but I didn't pre-order an unfinished game. Obviously being Early Access the performance is pretty horrible, even on high end hardware. So yeah, don't buy this game. Not yet. I think it will be great in a year or two, but right now it's just a mess and Atari doesn't deserve your money for how they've treated this game.			"

								quite possibly the worst game i have ever bought in my entire life...cry about my play time if you will, but that should speak for itself. if i cant go more than 30 minutes in a game without laughing at its horrible quality, then its not worth my time. how this was supposed to be a full release in december is beyond me, the idea to make this game in unity is rediculous. they chose unity because its an easy engine to work with. this game is just so laughably bad that i dont know where to begin. believe me i wanted to love this game, after playing PC alpha and comparing it to this, i am suprised this wasnt made by two people in theyre garage working on it for two weeks. the graphics are god aweful, this is 2016 ffs!!!!! games shouldnt look like minecraft if they are meant to be realistic, i mean come on! the best part about this game is the fanboys who defend this game like its the best thing ever in the discussion board. i honestly dont see this going much of anywhere. atari should have hired a realy dev team that has an actual sucessful game under theyre belt. i honestly believe this may spell the end for both nvizzio and atari, these reviews speak for themselves. do not buy this game, buy parkitect or planet coaster, both are incredible games with amazing dev teams that will do there best to help you out. :)			"

								The game isn't as bad as most people are making it out to be, but Nvizzio was a terrible choice. It really brings shame to the Roller Coaster Tycoon name. I know Atari has the rights to Roller Coaster Tycoon but we all know Frontier IS Roller Coaster Tycoon. I didnt want to advertize Planet Coaster here like everyone else did, but you really need to try it. We owe it to Pioneer, they did a great job on RCT3, Atari does not deserve the name and Nvizzio disgraced it. This is where Roller Coaster Tycoon dies and Planet Coaster is born.			"

Early Access Review
								This is not a bad game, but it has serious limitations which are a) infuriating and b) extraordinary considering this is about the fifth version of the game.My kids love the sandbox version, which allows them an unlimited budget to put together the teme park of their dreams and ride on the attractions they've created.  Frankly, $30 is quite a lot to pay for a kid's game.The campaign game, whereby grown-ups attempt to achieve goals, seems buggy.  The first time I played it, it gave me the option to build a handful of rides, but no paths.  Even as the game was telling me that I needed to build paths so park visitors could reach the rides that I'd built, it was giving me no option to build a path.The second time I played it, it gave me a paths option after a few minutes, and then a buildings option.  Then, after I'd built a few buildings, it took the buildings option away, and refused to restore it, even after I'd expanded the park substantially.  The game was telling me that my visitors were hungry, but denied me any opportunity to build restaurants.  The game told me rides were breaking down, but denied me any opportunity to build mechanic stations to provide the machenics to fix the rides.  Eventually, my park simply ground to a halt.At no time did the campaign game provide me an opportunity to build a flower bed.  I see lots of screenshots above of luscious parks, with lamps, and decorations, and attractions, but my experience is that you can only create such scenes in the sandbox version in which everything is unlocked.  Althogh I played the campaign games to the point that I had fairly extensive parks, never could I have constructed the screenshots in the publicity.Paths are the single, most-infuriating thing in the game.  In real life, you can build a path anywhere.  In Switzerland, they buld entire freeways across the Alps and through some of the world's largest mountains.  So why is constructing a dirt path across your theme park a great world of ""You can't do that""?  You need to make very certain in advance of where your paths are going to go, and you can't add to many extensions to them without extensive demolitionand reconstruction.  Visitors on the path constitute obstructions, so if you're hoping to rebuild a major pathway, you have little option but to close the park and wait for the traffic to clear.  This will take a very long time and represent a potentially catastrophic loss of income, but it's the only way you can reconstruct a path!  Other problems with path construction are too numerous to detail here.  Suffice to say that probably noting in this game will raise your blood pressure  more than path construction.All this said, the sandbox version is a lot of fun, in a SimCity kind of way.  If all you want to do is construct the theme park of your dreams, and then ride on all your attractions, it's great.  But I find it extraordinary that the developers have allowed the program's very obvious weaknesses to go ahead -- or even that the program's weaknesses weren't taken with in previous versions.  By the fourth version, you really shouldn't have to be enduring the frustration of non-functioning software! Actually, you shouldn't have to endure it in the first version.It has the potential to be a really brilliant game.  Were it not for the bugs, it would be.  But it seems to have been released on a premise of, ""It'll do.""  The assumption seems to be that, if the graphics are brilliant (and they are superlative!), the public will forgive you if they don't actually work.  Well, I'm not a programmer.  I don't play a game for the joy of exclaiming, ""Egad!  What good-quality graphics!""  When I pay $30 for a game, I expect it to have been thoroughly tested and to work perfectly.  And this game is anything but that.			"

												Devs wont provide updates to paying customers as to release date. They stated a date and then changed their mind and refuse to give us any information. The forums are full of people asking for updates but they could not care less cause they took our money. Also on the first beta that was barely playable it used the game time a clever tactic to make us all unable to refund our money. Please don't support this company as they are using shady tactics to make money and obviously do not care about the fans as they seem to wait months before providing updates that are not even relevant to questions asked on the forums. Atari is now just like EA\Ubisoft another company you cannot trust.Update:The Dev's decided to ban me from the forums for requesting updates from them. I never broke the rules but they need a ""Safe Space"" because words on the internet hurt. Anyways here is a pic of the ban and blank space where a reason is supposed to go. Make sure you don't say anything negative in the forums or you may just be banned also.


Devs Silence those who want updates.

								There are a lot of problems with this early version.  It is very frustrating....I built my park twice and both times the game crashed before I could even save it and had to start over.   Building paths is very jenky especially when linkiing up small paths to large ones.  Removing trees is a pain, perhaps I have not found a way to mass remove trees from an area, but having to click on each little tree and bush is annoying.  The modify terrain is also annoying, as the largest brush size is way too small.  I have not figured out how to assign machanics and janitors to certain areas....is there a way?  So far, my rides keep breaking down and the paths become a huge mess even though I have many machanics and janitors.  Hopefully these things get fixed.  I have been waiting so long for this game to come out, only to be disappointed :(			"

								At the moment I have to give this game a no for recommendation sadly. I had hoped that it would be a great game! But sadly it is missing SO MUCH and it is no where close to properly optimized. This is the first game on my just built PC that actually lags when I am building stuff.So to not just complain, here is a list for the dev's on what they may be able to do to somehwat salvage the game.1). Optimize your♥♥♥♥♥♥ I mean really optimize this game because holy crap.2). There needs to be more variety for rides and buildings, this game is over 10 years old and the original roller coaster tycoons have more rides.... you need to be surpassing that. Things like swimming stuff should already be in the game and not something that would be DLC because they where already in Roller Coaster Tycoon 3.3). Back to touch on something of optimization. You can't make a single path straight and that is starting to♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, nor can you place objects on paths basically wherever you want. This should not be an issue yet it is, I don't see how it can be an issue but you guys seem to have made it an issue.4). Fix the terrain tools so the brushes are larger when you are closer so that you can actually see if you have gotten everything down to the level you want it or up to the level you want it. I am constantly having the problem where I think I got it all then I build something and notice I didn't.5). Optimize the peeps, both workers and guests, so they stop being so dumb about things. I basically have to have a janitor/mechanic for every ride I put in the park because they seem to not move quick enough between everything. As for the peeps, every thrill ride and coaster I constantly have a path covered in puke even if I put a bathroom right next to the exit...6). I think that you guys may be heading in the right direction but there is just simply not enough in the game at the moment to get my recommendation. This may sound harsh, and it is, but I wouldn't even want to release the game with how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is at the moment. Add things like research and development into the game to unlock things, don't gate them behind completing parts of the campaign. That is tidious and annoying when I have no real control over what I want more of.7). Developers, listen to your audience and realize♥♥♥♥♥♥is going wrong at the moment. For example the grid, well since the grid isn't properly alligned at the moment it doesnt work, simple and easy fix but yet you guys haven't done it.

								Its early access so you can expect some features to be missing. I like the game while it plays, but I get out of memory issues when building a coaster repeatedly which means I cant get very far into it. I hope to recommend this game once they sort out the memory issues.			"

												------TWO HOURS OF MY PLAY TIME IS TRYING TO WAIT OUT LOAD SCREENS.----I can't even play the game anymore. Haven't been able to since early access because I can't get past a loading screen.Reported it to steam and asked for a refund. Couldn't give me one so now I'm tempted to just delete this atrocity from my library.When I did play, it was awful. I loved the classic cames and spent countless hours on them, but this is not one of those games. This genuinely felt like it was just a quick cash grab since they knew so many old fans would be dying to get another RTC game. I'm absolutely disgusted.Don't buy it. Just don't do it. Go buy Planet Coaster instead. "

								At this point I give the game a vote of no confidence. It has potential. Clearly there were a lot of good ideas that the developers were working on. However, at this point nearly every single functionality of the game is broken or deeply flawed. I'm not saying it can't or won't be fixed. But the game was supposed to be released in December (and really was supposed to be released before that) and it's now April. I'm thinking the developer is in over their heads here and there's a possibility that this mess can't be fixed. I really hope I'm wrong,			"

""We know this is not what some of you may have expected. Thus, we are reaffirming our refund policy – we allow refunds up to March 31st 2016 to anyone that pre-ordered the game through Atari.com or RollerCoasterTycoon.com. This gives you a day to try Early Access, no strings attached. If you pre-ordered via Steam or another retailer, they will be able to facilitate refunds as needed."" - Rollercaster Tycoon I was ok sweet well atleast let me try it out and see if it has any potential.. If I dont like it they will give me time to get a refund. Played it, again an incomplete game with bugs. I love paying 50 dollars for a crappy and buggy software.. So I submit a refund request with Steam.. Turns out I have more than 2 hr of gameplay.. Steam wont give me a refund.. So heres were Roller Coaster lies. Lies about release day, lies about the refund. So in the mean time im playing the better game of Planet Coaster. I hope to god Roller Coaster Tycoon gets their game fixed, so I dont seem like I paid for a crappy program.			"

								I know this is early acces but my god what a piece of crap this is!Game crashes sometimes. (just bought new powerfull hardware) I watched some trailers and some game-play video's of the game but the grapics are just not the same. They are horrible. The rides, tree's and buildings look ok, but the people/AI look like they pulled them out of the year 2008 and placed them in a 2016 game. people are lagging out of the trains. employees fly throug little hills and over the paths. workman; you can't direct them where to go or what to do. engineer; they don't do check-ups and safety controls, even not when you put the timer on 10 minutes. docters; well, wtf do these guys do? all my people had broken arms or something like that.The people (AI) are so stupid. they throw up after 5 seconds when they get out of the ride. my park was filled with pee (the yellow♥♥♥♥♥♥on the paths is pee because people couldn't find toilets). I placed toilets everywhere and those ♥♥♥♥♥ couldn't find them. the AI in Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 were more intelligent then these guys.I builded a park in this game were people (the AI0 would recommand my park to there friends, but I would definitely not recommand this game to my friends. I could be such an awesome game and i hope the producers do something with all the feedback but for now i'm done with this game. It really needs a lot of work. my advice: if you really wanna play this game, WAIT FOR THE ORIGINAL RELEASE AND DON'T GO EARLY ACCES! Early acces will only dissapoint you.			"

												I gave it a shot. I tried. I wanted to support this beloved franchise, but beloved no more. I had 1000x more fun with Planet Coaster Alpha, Beta even moreso. Save the money and especially save the frustration. Planet Coaster's editor is second to none...save No Limits 2. But that's more of a CAD program than a game.No, RCTW lost me after 65 hours. And I say this with much regret. Maybe the Workshop crowd can make something out of this mess, but I'm not sure that even the best modders have anything tangible to work with here. Will check in from time to time to see if there are any improvements, but as of now, it's Planet Coaster all the way.			"

								You could try and ignore all the many bugs, the rubbish graphics, the really awful looking guests, the amateurish animations, the bad AI, the cheap and often incorrect sounds, the slow map loading, the low framerates, and the blury out of focus camera to stop you noticing the lack of details in the models and textures, if you really want to play this game, but you're better off rolling round in a stinging nettle bush.I realise that currently this is an early release game. however, this must have been done on a low budget and it is not worthy of being part of the Rollercoaster Tycoon series.  Many of the current issues were reported to the developers by testers months ago (why are they not fixed?).If you want to play a top quality triple A Rollercoaster game then look at Frontier's Planet Coaster, the developers of Rollercoaster Tycoon 3.  Although, at the time of writing this review Planet Coaster is currenly in early alpha, it is vastly better than this disaster.Honestly, save yourself money and anguish and avoid this game (and stinging nettle).

												I'm gonna recommend this game for the following reasons:  - The game is in beta stage, and they've made beta testing mainly to fix bugs, and find main issues on the way. However after i've seen this beta so far, there's still alot they'll need to improve, but the tools you do have are excellent compared to other coasters. - It's like Cities Skylines of Roller Coaster games, mainly because the community is huge for this game, and steam workshop. A lot of people fear that there's only 10 coasters, don't worry just wait 1-3 months and you'll have pretty much every coaster in the world to play around with. Not only can you share what you've made, but also most likely see legendary coasters in-game. But for every coaster i guess they'll look on highway systems from Cities Skylines for an example where you could pick different interchanges from the community, in this game under speciality, you'll most likely find extreme versions of loops, corkscrews and etc. - Even though the game is pretty good so far, as i said earlier there's a lot of features they'll need to add. It's almost impossible to make something 100% straight, and i will go cry in a corner if they don't add such a feature, because that's mainly one of the few things you'll need. So after this review, i would say the game got a bright future, but it takes some time to get used to, i really wanted a tutorial in the beta, just to know how the mechanics work. It's nice to being able to tweak EVERYthing on your coaster. But they should add classic mode coaster building from the older games. All in all if it was up to me i would give it 7/10 for now, but it's only in beta and hopefully it will only improve from full release 10th dec. But lets see how the next beta goes, and if the game actually improved or they'll need to push the release date a few months.			"

Early Access Review
								I am a huge fan of RCT3 and I was dreaming of the release of a sequel since a couple of years after its release in 2004. Up until yesterday before the release, I was only slightly frustrated it was taking so much time for the game to come out (it was originally planned to be released early 2015) as I really wanted the game to be as great as possible and did not mind Atari taking time to make a game that would deserve to be called RCT, especially after I got to play the beta back in November 2015 when I saw that they were very far from having any part of the game finished at all.But after such a long wait when I finally got to play RCTW yesterday, I went through extreme excitement to denial, followed by disgust and finally ended up laughing nervously in front of my screen.To make it simple, if RCT3, a 12 years old game was released today, it would still be by very, very, very far a better game.In RCTW, everything is broken:- The graphics of the peeps, structures and the land when zoomed are absolutely disgusting and can compete with games like Super Mario 64 released 20 years ago (I am barely exaggerating)- The roller coaster building system is completely broken and it takes hours to complete one that has many chances to end up not working properly at the end.- It is very buggy, I mean so so so so so buggy, I had to relaunch the game 3 times in 2 hours I never saw anything like that before.- Despite the fact that they look like they were made using MS Paint, the peeps will look like either vampires (Vendors at stands with red eyes) or zombies (they walk like zombies when they hold anything), or witches (janitors cleaning vomit with a broom and hovering when moving). Looks like they got the horror theme right at least!- The non roller coasters rides are not only very few but look worse than the ones on RCT3. The way peeps act while on some of them is completely unnatural and it just hurts so much looking at it.- Unless I missed something, there is only ONE song that can be played for all the rides. They give you the option to change it depending on the theme but essentially, it is the same song just slightly different! And if you have 2 rides next to each other and play the music on both, the music is not synchronised and I let you imagine what it sounds like!- Even when I got frustrated and tried to be nasty with my peeps this would not work! The peep picking tool does not work, taking one and putting them at the opposite part of the park teleports them back to their original place after a few seconds, peeps in cars that are ejected from the coaster will be teleported to the exit, and drowning peeps (Yes, I was very annoyed at this point!) by adding water does not work, they either keep walking underwater or may eventually stop moving and start ""jumping"" in the water indefinitely.A few extras:-Most park management options from RCT3 are gone.-Peeps disappearing, flying, going through walls, queuing the wrong way.-Female peeps (even male?) make porn sounds.-Sounds of babies crying all the time or children sounding like they are being tortured.-Background decors unfinished.I am stopping here but I could add more, and that is after having played the game only 2 hours!But I know what some of you may want to say: ""it's normal it's an early access!""Well, before you go any further, here is a thing: Atari had planned to release the game early 2015, and after being postponed multiple times, we got to play the beta in November 2015. More than 4 months later, I cannot see ANY improvement whatsoever that has been made. (I actually think it is even worse as during the beta we did not get the chance to see the monstrosity that are the peeps as they were only ""ghosts"" back then.)Atari had multiple chances and a lot of time to improve the game but fact is they just did not care so I cannot see how this game will be any better in the future. I requested a refund of the game and advise everyone not to buy this game.A very disappointed fan. "

You've even taken out some useful tools for rct3 which makes the game even more of a drag to play. Would not recommend buying this at this stage. Maybe in atleast 6 months time when some kinks are sorted out but even then I don't know if the gameplay will be any better.			"

You have not seen any coaster in real life, do you? Why should all trains wait in front of 4 free sections to go with all other trains at the exact same time? Too bad I hoped, that the developers will fix basics during early acces. Therefore no more refund via steam.

								We are huge fans of RollerCoaster Tycoon, however, we are done with this franchise and want a refund.  RollerCoaster Tycoon World  is a FAIL on so many levels---a few examples are: there is no edge scrolling so you need two hands to play the game; the graphics look like cartoon graphics, not what was presented in the trailer; the game  play space to too small for the sizes of the pre-made rides, too many trees that need to be deleted because the rollercoaster takes up more than half of the park space (that is filled with trees!) ---the list goes on!  We suggest that you go back to the drawing board using RollerCoaster Tycoon 1 (Deluxe) as the base game and improve the graphices on that one ---even that would be better that what you have provided.   If you are planning to be new to the franchise don't waste your money on this one; buy the first two if you want to have clean and simple fun and the third one if you prefer a more graphic experience,  This one is not worth the money.

								You know to be completely honest I loved RCT all the way up to RCT3 Platinum. But honestly now I feel its gone into the wrong hands. I really think I know where it went wrong, Atari. The game was originally created by one man, then in 2 Frontier came in to make it even better, In 3 it was still great when Atari came in, but when Atari seized power all was lost. Atari made some good games, unfortunately Rollercoaster sims are not their thing. I don't want Atari to feel horrible or like it is a lost cause, because quite frankly some people are still going to enjoy it and some have already bought it, but this project is going to lose them money. I played through a friend, and thought it was fun, but when I saw gameplay for PlanetCoaster my experience was over taken just watching the video. Here is the fact Frontier knows what they are doing, they are making PlanetCoaster, and they therefore changed the name of the true RCT. I think in all fairness your money is better spent there. If you aren't a mechanics freak like me and most others though you'll still enjoy RCT. I am not reccomending the game however, because it hasn't met my criteria. Sorry to the Atari RCTW team, hope you can find better luck in a different and hopefully following project (If this one doesn't send you spiraling out of business).			"

								At this point in time, RollerCoaster Tycoon World just isn't ready. To be honest, for a game that was to be complete by this point in time, only to be shunned into Early Access again, and to be as buggy as can be - I don't think this merits spending the $20 that I did (I bought this game through a CD key on a different website, so I cannot refund the game, but hey, it was $20). If you are planning on spending $50 on the game at this time, please don't. It's not worth it. $20 is pushing it at the time - I know there is the opportinuty for this game to get better, and if it does, I will go back and I will change my review.On a more positive note, the game is very stable - I don't think it is quite as efficient as it could be, but again, that is an expectation for an Early Access game. I think to be fair, that is something that will get better over time. I had no issues with the game crashing or anything like that - it was laggy until I adjusted graphics settings, but overall it was fine. There are a ton of graphical bugs in this game though - Roller coasters suddenly having peeps go away for no reason, that kind of thing.Overall, I'd stay away for now. Give it some more time. I think there is a chance it will get better.... but I can't say for sure.			"

Requested refund and am going to wait for Planet Coaster - which shows so much more promise.  Cities: Skylines turned out to be what most people were hoping for in the last SimCity.  Let's hope that Planet Coaster is the true successor to RCT3.  Sadly, RollerCoaster Tycoon World does not appear to be it.			"

								I do believe this game has potential. It has the bases to be a very fun game, and good successor to RCT3. But currently, there are far too many issues and glitches. I've given time, to see if they'd be sorted. But nothing seems to happen quickly. So for now, it's a no.Please sort it out! As I really want to love this game.			"

								I'm honestly trying very hard to like this game, but the developers have seemingly made it impossible.  I know this is still a game in development.   Where do I start with the issues with this game?  First of all, making a simple path in Rollercoaster Tycoon should never have been made so freaking complicated.  Paths do not connect to other paths correctly and you never can seem to angle the pathways where you want them.  And God forbid you mess up a pathway and need to delete something because, in my experience, you will need to delete almost all your pathways to correct the issue.  What is the point of an elevated pathway if you cannot light it for your peeps?  Rides are hit and miss.  The flatrides sort of come off as generic.  It would be better if you could modify the colors of the flatrides to at least make them appear different instead of the generic colors they come with.  Rollercoasters are seemingly impossible to get working correctly and seem to have an extreme rating even for the most simple of speeds/drops.  So far, every time they do a major patch my parks that I have saved do not want to load.  So I have resignated myself to not get too attached to any park that I create.  I've had two parks so far that I can not use because of updates corrupting the file.  Like I said, I'm trying very hard to like this game but it needs a lot of work.			"

								Honestly, I think a lot of the negative reviews are from the constant disappointment. For the game to be delayed 3 times and end up being early access.... Who wouldn't be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about that? The game is for sure not finished and doesn't run very smooth, but it has a lot of potential to be a good game. If the developers actually use the early access to perfect the game, then yes, I will recommend it. If the game gets stuck in early access and never goes anywhere, then there will be a lot of angry RCT fans. Last, the game doesn't have much content at all. I really hope they double if not triple the amount of content in the game. To charge 50$ for this game is kind of a joke. Let's just say the additional content/DLC better be free for game owners.  For now I'm going to give it a thumbs down, but I will quickly change it to a thumbs up if I see the developers are actually making progress.  "

								Broken game.  Black screen and mouse on start up.  Fully updated drivers, etc...  Buyers beware.  50 dollar Black Screen Simulator 2016.Update:  After discovering a work around for a law in the game coding not letting it start, I have been able to play the game.  However, there are many game breaking bugs right now.  This includes things like bugged repair guys who are unmovable and you cannot fix rides, or none of the Janitors cleaning anything, or all guests bugging out and not riding anything and causing you to run out of money and the guests needs meters dropping and them  being upset at your park.  You can't build a park bigger then about half of the starting area at the moment, because the game becomes very laggy and can lead to crashing or more bugs appearing.  The current state of the game plays like an Alpha more then a Beta, which has not been play tested AT ALL.			"

								Welcome to a game that looks worse then Rollercoaster tycoon 3.I normally never ask for a refund for a game, but holy cow this game is a mess that seems more like coming out of a scam indie studio then a well-known Atari backed studio that seemed to have control on the development and was finally giving us another great rollercoaster tycoon game, but even in early access this game is so broken that it would require a major overhaul so big that we would not see it for a long time and they do not seem willing to do that. I can live with graphics that are not top end, i can live with certain framedrops and lag in a early access game. What i do not however can live with and support is a broken game where it´s not just the above that is the problem, its also animation, core gameplay elements like guests actually going to a store, guests that run around like headless chickens because the queue is not long enough, pathways that are just poor. not to mention ridecams that made me look at the date just to make sure i was not actually back in the 90´s.These things was even in a old Rollercoaster tycoon 3 but it seems that the developers have forgotten that we are writing 2016 and not 1996. So can i recommend this?, not a chance in fact STAY FAR FAR FAR FAR AWAY. Unless they change their game drastically this is a failiure.			"

								Save your money for Planet Coaster Instead.This game is OK at best.  Which is a shame becuase I love rollercoaster tycoon.I will say, though, that the spline system (When it works) is awsome.  You can really make the coasters exactly how you want them with every inch.I don't even want to play this game after playing the alpha of Planet Coaster.  It shines WAY brighter than this game and you can't even build rollercoasters yet.  Just the sheer building and park decoration is FAR more enjoyable than this game with being able to manage the park and create rides.  Sorry RollerCoaster Tycoon, but here is where we go our seperate ways.You should have kept Frontier Developments in charge of the game.			"

								so i played alittle on the ""SandBox"" Mode and the Moment the Game Loaded in i seen a SMALL Park, Nothen like RTC3 with how big the land is for the park, Sandbox should be unlimited amount of space because well its ""SANDBOX"" Mode, I love every Roller Coaster Tycoon, Iv been waiting for this game since March of last year when it was announched for a Release in November then it was pushed to December and Then to March 30th. Now i am gonna give it more time for me to play, But i remember the first time i played RCT 1 i was glued to my Computer Seat for Hours and Hours, Same with RCT 2 and 3, While i was Streaming RCTW last night i played and was BORED out of my mind, As of right now If your a fan of RCT 1,2, and 3 DO NOT BUY OR PLAY THIS GAME until it is fully finished, You will HATE Roller Coaster Tycoon for EVER after if do play it, You place a ride and it has a Set Enterance and Exit Port unable to move where the Enterence and Exit is, Overall as of right now i am giving RCTW a 3/10 rating, i may change this review when more updates come out but as of right now its a 3/10. I WAS SO EXCITED FOR THIS GAME. =(			"

								I have been a fan of the previous three instances of Rollercoaster Tycoon, but this new one... well, it is bad in almost everything.Lets start with ride/road placement. It is almost impossible to place a ride or shop on an existing road. It just does not work! you have to delete the road, place the ride, and redo the road. And it is hard to get nice grids...The next biggy is the graphics. Nowadays, I expect a photorealistic rendition of the park, but it looks more like a bad video game out of year 2000... I mean, even the older RCTs had better graphics (if not really 3D graphics, but that is beside the point).The only good thing that I can say about the game is the new freeform functions, but that is about it.

								I was about to seek a refund and realized the download was available. I will not compare this game to any other like game currently on the market ""for fairness"", with that said.. This game was something like a job I got as a teenager, it looks so much better on paper than it did in real life. Somehow it just doesn't seem as fun as all the prior installations and I have played RCT 1-3 (and all the add-ons loopy landscapes, corkscrew follies et al), today there is a sort of vibe, nay, passion missing in RCT. Pro's:My PC didn't crashThings are a hint more attractiveThere is more detail (like a mop bucket behind the janitors station for example) ooohPeeps have no character, groups etc.. The parking lot adds realismI like the park and rides management systemCute ride and shop namesCurved paths nice path detailsLots of plants optionsBenches and lighting can be off the pathsCons:I spent the moneyMore puke than ever - ""look a lamp-post"" - bleeeghDon't know why the game just seems flat - lifeless. Nothing really snapped to a grid as I expectedI put in nice dining I had zero popularity though I had 600 peeps visit it they must be just reading the menu'sPaths are a pain - periodDecor construction tools was limited - walls etc..Deleting: ever tiny bunch of green and tiny little pebble to put in a ride was just silly.Deleting: select a ride and it's so easy to select another ride nearbyIf there is enough negative feedback - this might be all we get folks.My guess is they had to rush this out to avoid refunds (tough to account for behind the scenes). Seems like someone is spread too thin to have made this right the first time (I feel bad them and wish them luck). This game could have been very profitable if the right internal resources were dedicated to it. If the game is ever finished I'll give it another go but have no plans on participating in early access forums. If this game were $15.99 and I'd give it a thumbs up for value. I think this game is simply OK, I give them a thumbs to the marketing team for getting good revenue. That is one approach to business..			"

								First off, the game has a lot of bugs. Also to build rollercoaster sit takes a lot of thought, (Which can be better at times) whereas in rollercoaster tycoon 3 you could get in and build a rollercoaster coaster like that. No messing around with safety and the free form tool is messed up. However I'm personally a big sucker to when it comes to FPS (Frames per second) and graphics quality. RTC world delivers this really well compared to RTC3. Terrain editing is much nicer as the tiles are gone from RTC3 and blending is better. Although rides and rollercoaster scant go underground and after you've finished a rollercoaster, you can't edit the terrain that sits underneath the track! That sucks! Also when zooming out, peeps become more static. By that I mean there is no movement in there arms, legs and body but instead the shuffle along the ground as if your FPS is down at 2! As well as there is a lack of themes. I know that RTC3 only had an extra 5 themes through the platinum edition but come on Atari, add more themes and as well as there is no filter to filter themes like on RTC3; there all in one big list!To conclude I wouldnt buy this game yet. It has a lack of customisation and needs to be developed. I do realise this is early access and not everything is added and flushed out, exactly why you shouldn't buy this game just yet. Once the game is out fully then give it a go but stick to RTC3 or planet coaster.John			"

Early Access Review
								Most of the negative reviews of this game are completely unwarranted. I've been a fan of this franchise since the very first game, and this has the potential to be the best one yet, even though it does need a lot of work. Most of the people who seem to hate it either seem to ignore the fact that it's an incomplete early release, or simply didn't have the patience to actually learn how to play it. Finally, I think it does measure up to it's main competitor, Planet Coaster.First, let me say that if you're expecting an easy-to-play, piece-by-piece builder like the previous two where everything always comes out perfectly square and symmetrical with complete ease, you're going to be disappointed. The node-based coaster builder can be tricky, and it takes some work to get parallel tracks or symmetrical scenery arrangements. However, most of the people complaining about this seem to have completely ignored the snap and grid options. Once you learn to use it, I actually find these elements superior to analogous elements in other simulators like Cities:Skylines. It does take a while to learn to and optimize the path building, scenary placement, and coaster-building features, and it's a bit more difficult to use, but the trade off in difficulty pays off with the high level of freedom you have. Now, something very negative about this game, it is EXTREMELY buggy in its current state. It crashes a lot, the frame rate is really low, a number of the features (such as the coaster's physics engine) are woefully incomplete, and the AI in guests and maintainence needs a lot of work, but it is important to remember this is an incomplete game. It's probably more buggy than most games that are called beta or early access, but that's more the fault of Atari's marketing than the game itself. If they work out these bugs, it has the potential to be a really good game.The best feature of the game by far is the coaster builder. Judging by other comments and You Tube videos, most of the people complaining about it seem to have absolutely no clue what they are doing and haven't even tried to learn how to use it. It is in my opinion the best coaster builder out there right now. It's less complex than No Limits, and gives you way more freedom than the builders in the first three or the current version of Planet Coaster. Granted, the physics engine is probably incomplete and what's right now there is probably a place holder (there's very little friction on coasters, the breaks are way to powerful) and there are some bugs with the coaster builder (frame rate slows way down, some features cause it to crash, and there are a number of bugs with the breaks). It's also somewhat difficult to learn how to use (though should come somewhat naturally to those familiar with No Limits), but again what you lose in easiness pays off in what you gain in freedom. Again, don't expect an easy piece-by-piece builder, but do expect to be able to build really realistic coasters. I love the mixture of node and piece-by-piece builders.Since I also have access to the early bird version of Planet Coaster, I think it's worth doing a point-by-point comparison between the two. Granted, both games are incomplete, so all of this is subject to change, but it's worth mentioning how I think the two stack up against each other.So far, here's what's better about RCTW:-Better Coaster Builder with way more freedom than you have in PC, but PC's builder isn't even in alpha yet so this can change.-Better path builder. PC's path builder is easily the worst part of the game, it's so wonky and very difficult to build decent looking paths.-UGC. As someone who spent hours looking for and working with CS in RCT3, this is a huge plus. The integration with Steam Workshop is great, and it allows to add elements of piece-by-piece building in RCTW that aren't there yet. Also, it expands the potential for customization in the game in the future way out there.-Better looking flat rides.-Better camera controls. Though PC has very similar controls to RCT3, RCTW's controls are more intuitive and don't clash with other controls in the game.Here's what's better about PC:-Better overall graphics. Even though some elements in RCTW are more detailed, the lighting, shadows, and such in PC are way superior.-Better sounds. Sounds like guests on coasters are having sex in RCTW, and coaster sounds in PC are more realistic. Also, it sounds a lot less cluttered.-Better Scenery builder. Piece-by-piece building allows for a lot more freedom in building buildings and the scenery in general looks better.-Better AI. Peeps act and move more naturally, and there are fewer bugs. It gets you to think about the layout of your park a lot more.-Way less buggy, and better optomized overall.Here's what's neutral/debatable between the two:-Stalls. The Stalls in RCTW are more realistic, and the feature of walk-in resteraunts is a huge plus. But, the stalls in PC are more customizable.-Coster stations. Like stalls, they're more realistic in RCTW, but more customizable in PC. Granted, RCTW's devs said they're planning on allowing for blank coaster stations for mor customizations in future updates.-RCTW has more features, game modes, and such as of now but that's just where it is in its development.Overall, I slightly prefer RCTW but that's mainly because the main reason I've ever played these games is for coaster building and, as it stands now, RCTW has more features overall, but PC just needs to catch up in development. Both have the potential to be great games.In conclusion, do not by this game if you're looking for a completely ready-to-play, fully optimized, and easy-to-play game. It still needs a lot of work, and is difficult to learn to master all the controls. Most of the reason why people seem to hate it is a mixture of bad marketing and unrealistic expectations of how complete it would be. For casual gamers new to the genre of theme park simulators, it's definitely not worth the price. But if you truly love simulation games, and have the patience to work through the bugs and actually learn how to play, and want to support the development of a potentially good game, it's definitely worth it.

								 Having played and enjoyed the RCT franchise for most of my life, I was overjoyed when I heard this game was in development. I never thought a Roller Coaster Tycoon game could be butchered so badly. Boy, was I proven wrong. This game feels like a bad port of a knock-off RCT game for a mobile platform. There's barely any content, the graphics are sub-par, the UI is clunky, the guests lag the game, and you can't even move the camera with the mouse. They said this game was 80-90% done upon release? And after numerous release delays, they have the audacity to try and hide it behind an Early Access tag at the last minute to attempt to cover up how flawed the game is. There is no excuse for this.This game does not deserve to be called a Roller Coaster Tycoon game.			"

I had to fight my wife for the PC when RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 came out because she got addicted too. I love this franchise! However, after playing RCTW for less than an hour, I have requested a refund. I might purchase it again when it leaves early access and is a proven, solid game. Until then, I am sorely disappointed. I am unable to trust Atari with those titles that I grew up with, those fragile memories from my childhood. This saddens me deeply.In the meantime, Planet Coaster kicks♥♥♥♥♥♥ The true spiritual succesor by the developers behind RT3. Go buy it, NOW!			"

So many people forget or don't realise that Nvizzio have only been working on this for about 18 months or so, proir to this 2 others had tried and failed, so there was and still is a LOT of work to be done before the masses get a finished product. This isn't something that will happen quickly either.At the moment it needs a speccy PC to run too, as it uses rather a lot of memory at the moment. Some users report upto 8Gb of RAM being used by just this game alone. Yes there are a lot of features this game doesn't have yet but these things will come, in time. And Devs are listening to the community feedback and more importantly, doing something about the problems being reported. They are doing Bi-weekly updates on the game, with a live stream to showcase the update content just a few days prior to each one. They too, like us want this game to be the awesome game we all know it can be. I am hopefull they can pull this off and will stick with it all the way through development. So, to recap.In my honest opinion its a good game. Yes it has quirks at the moment and there's a few glitch's here and there and the massive memory usage. But I am enjoying it and creating some wonderfull parks with some awesome coasters.Game updated on 07/06 - Review updateWOW. The new update has made significant imrovement to the game. It still uses a fair bit of memory, but with the new skybox and a few other tweaks performance is getting better, slowly. It still has more work to be done, but the game is now running a bit smoother. Peeps are working better and overall the quality of graphics is now better too.Game Update - 30/08 - Review updatePiece by Piece Building has now come to RCTW and is amazing to use.With the previous 2 updates breaking the game for most, I was hopeful to try the new update to see what, if anything has improved.Unfortunately there is still ZERO improvement in performance. It has now got even worse. Game lags like crazy and glitch's here there and freakin' everywhere. And although you may see me playing RCTW now and again, beleive me when I say I DO NOT AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND RollerCoaster Tycoon World to anyone in its current state.Review Update - 18/11/2016So RCTW has now been released.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. STAY WELL AWAY.Yet AGAIN all they have done is add more content and brought more bugs and lag to the game. These people DO NOT CARE about the commuintiy. RCTW has loads of missing features and is NOWHERE near ready to be released			"

												I felt duped when I preordered RCTW and it suddenly went into ""Early Access"" when it was supposed to be in full release form. At that time the game felt like it was alpha at best. I held on to hope that Atari valued their audience and were going to make the best of things by delivering a finished product by full release. I defended RCTW and told others to just give them time and they might be able to turn things around. Duped again apparently. *I think* they were pushed to some arbitrary holiday deadline, or afraid of Frontier's game, either way it has released in a very sub-par state. I tried to like RCTW but it's just not good enough. No matter how good this last group of devs are and even though they tried to listen to us they were given a task that was insurmountable. All in all I would stay away from this game, it had potential but they sadly bungled it. The best thing I got from my pre-order was the lesson to never pre-order another game. *PROS*-The Coaster Creator. You can build pretty good looking rides once you learn a bit about how it works.-When they work right the flat rides are not so bad.*CONS*(The Short List)-The path system. It has never worked right. They fixed it up as best they could but that's like putting lipstick on a pig.-The AI. Nothing like watching guests form a vortex at the paths between the food stalls and the bathrooms, never to ride another ride again. Or sit down. Or anything but eat and defecate.-Still feels like a beta state game. Memory leaks still reported. Game breaking glitches still present from early access.*TL/DR* Not worth the price of admission. "

Early Access Review
								RCT WORLD is an unstable game that crashes constantly, even on high end computer systems.  The game likes to crash when using the bulldozer and has crashed while trying to save causing hours of coaster building to go down the drain.  I recommned that while you build or design coasters that you save the same coaster build twice under two different names.The look of the game is gorgeous, with realistic peeps, lighting, and textures. The coaster building freeform is interesting however requires some tweeking.  I recommend having more preconstructed options available like loops and helixes as these are difficult to make with the system...(at least smooth concentric loops and helixes.)  The curved paths are a bear to acclimate to.  I should be able to click on a start then an end position of the path and then adjust the curve as desired. Im sure that updates, fixes, and additional content will be forthcoming and constant.  Water, travel, and more thrill rides have been promised.  Tunnels will be nice too.  I have not yet attempted to create my own scenery, however, if I can play the game for 15 min without it locking up, seizing for half an hour, or out right crashing, I may attempt to import some buildings created in lightwave.  As it stands constant crashing is my bigest grip to an otherwise interesting game..the crashing makes the game unplayable in my opinion, at least at this point,  and requires some serious patching to improve stability, especially if they are charging $60 for the game.

Early Access Review
								I just downloaded this game and played for maybe 30 minutes. I read all of the reviews, and I still decided I wanted the game because I love all of the old ones. I figured it would at least be as good as the last one that came out years ago. I'm going to try it out a little longer and I'm hoping I'll like it more. Overall though, it's super laggy. I don't have a fancy PC, but it's decent and it was constantly lagging at least a little. I also really dislike the pathway builder. It doesn't really sound that important, but you have to build paths constantly on this game. It's difficult to even make the path go straight at times. Another thing that I didn't see anyone else mentioned, but it bothered me, was that on the old ones you simply hired employees as you needed them. On this one you have to build buildings for all the different kinds of services. I don't like that because it takes up room of my park for no reason. I haven't even built a coaster yet!! Not sure if I should try to get  refund yet, but let's just say I'd rather be playing the one that came out 17 years ago.			"

Early Access Review
								This game should not be released, not even in ""early access / beta"", why ? - Path building is horrible, you have to demolish entrances because you cannot connect new roads, no upgrade or change of path looks / building stones without removing them.- Path building can be blocked by a small flower that is on the ground, which you can't even see from some zoom levels, you only get a ""red path"" signal. - The only way to build decent looking park is by using both snap & grid function views to connect attractions or even queues to your paths. - Terraforming the same as with path building, you do not get an error you can only see that some hills cannot be flattened. then you zoom in and you see a small bush blocking your (IRL) bulldozer?? - No water attractions, and except for rollercoaster the list junior & familiy ride is quite small.Again a game which you should not preorder, I hope this helps.Regards,Torzino			"

								Every review I see on here is bashing on the graphics. Honestly I'm not here to look at a pretty game I'm here to make a park and have fun. So graphics aside. This is my review.I've only played a bit and I'm not impressed!Camera: The camera in the game is awful. You use the WASD keys to move. Why can't I click and hold left and drag? When you zoom in it gets blurry and looks awful. Pathing: Don't even bother trying to put a que line or anything down. It's annoying. It doesn't work. Just don't. Also why can't I right click to delete stuff? Speaking of...Teraforming: OMG KILL ME. What do you mean I can't move the land up? OH because of that little stupid rose bush?! Well just move it up with it or just delete it. Instead you have to go to the delete tool, delete the tree/bush, go back to terrain, then and only then can you move it.Que Lines: Why do I have to BUY the ride sign? Why isn't it just on the end like it is on EVERY RCT?Overall: So sad. Wanted to like it, wanted to think everyone was wrong about it. But no. This game (I know it's early) Has a lot of issues. It feels like  the people behind this game have never even played a roller coaster tycoon. Off to check out Planet Coaster.			"

								Holly Hell!I have put in 4 hours. I am really trying to love it. I am the biggest Coaster tycoon fan I know of. Loaded my game, and all finance stats are gone. All positive cash gone, and im negative 17k.All rides are broken. In one part of the park, there are 2 rides broken. So I built 4 large mechanic shops with 10 mechanics each. That is 40 mechanics and the rides wont get fixed! The shops are right next to the rides. The path technology is terrible!!I can go on and on. It's unplayable. I had fun trying to play around the bugs, but then I just kept finding worse ones. Don't turn on the heat map! It screws up the entire game!Charlie Brown's words keep speaking in my mind ""oh good grief..."" lolsure hope this all gets fixed..... and soon!			"

								Utter dissapointment, and great regrets.  If you have Roller Coaster Tycoon 3, don't even bother.I got so excited when I read on March 29th that the game finally had a release date and it was March 30th!  The game which I purchased last fall which then had a release date of December 2015, later pushed to ""early 2016"" after a very poor beta weekend.They now released the game under ""early access.""Do not buy this game expecting the next installment in the Roller Coaster Tycoon franchise.  Think of it as some new knock off game trying to live up to what was, and falling shortThemed stalls selling unthemed items, really?!  RCT franchise is dead like many other great games such as Sim City.			"

I would recommend waiting until at least a few patches come out or wait until launch and see what the final reviews are compared to Planet Coaster.			"

								Well this game is not what I expected it to be, first of all i've been playing the game for an hour now and I still haven't successfully built a path, the controls are so difficult to use and the tutorial isn't much help either with a measly three step guide that was certainly no use. Overall I think that the graphics have progressed really well from the previous game, however I was a little dissapointed when going on the camera view to play on the ride to find that the graphics were very much the same as rct3. Another issue I seem to be having is that due to my unsuccesful building of a path i'm having to delete an awful lot, this however came with yet more difficulty as the demolish cursor wouldnt snap right to the path. Having not gone any further into the game I am unaware as to what other issues may occur but I am sure there is plenty, if it was possible for me to return this game and get a refund then I certainly would be doing!

												For this beta they wanted to test the coaster builder. It works fine if you get the hang of it, but for some reason the coaster will never be finished. I tried to build 1 coaster, but it totally randoms fails at random places. Yes, it even failed for me with chaining up before the drop or sometimes even when leaving the station(physics problems).Sometimes it made sense it failed, but then you tweak the place where it failed, you can tweak everything thats next aswell..Had some other issues aswell:-Needed to change my graphic card settings to get the game even running(otherwise you see a nice blue screen and   after some time you get kicked back you desktop).-Memory leak, after some time the game is not playable anymore, checked what it was but 8GB ram wasnt enough....-Game Speed affected the rollercoaster.-Camera is sometimes hard to control when building the coaster.It's the first beta, but they wanted feedback on the coaster builder (How people like the new system of building coasters). But if you can't play normal to test this thing then I say this game ain't ready to launch yet.Hope this game will release later then the date they stated.So for now I don't recommend this game! "

								I decided to buy this game despite the overall bad review of the beta, as I was willing to forgive and forget the terrible mobile game. I like many others loved the first 3 games of this franchise and I was super pumped when they announced RCT World however upon playing this early acess I don't think its anywhere near completion, like every other game it has it's pros and cons.Cons:• I took me two days to solve the 57% loading bug, thanks to help from the forums. •This game was not made for an averidge computer/laptop which is something they should've taken into consideration when making this game that not everyone has a high performing PC/laptop.•The lag in this game is so real, like for real sort that out.•The controls of this game are complicated and a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to figure out.•The view ride option needs working on, I personally liked the design of it back in RCT3Pros:•I love the new look of the game, its smooth and somewhat realistic.•The new rollercoaster builder is easy and simple to use however once again is not good for laptop users.

												Absolute loads of pants! When I brought this game it worked fine, albeit the game was not what I expected, the land was small, the objectives boring and simple and the lack of features were annoying. However the designers slowly added new features and such but after a certian update, the game no longer worked, I would get as far as the opening videos then nothing and looking at the community disscusions I'm not the only one this has happened to, in fact a lot of users reported this issue (along with many other crashing issues).

Very few options of rides to build, the construction is terrible, I can never get straight or clean building of paths, rollercoaster construction is horrible, I can never construct what I want when I'm doing it and its not like the old games. I'm fed up with it, I've tried, I've played it for hours hoping I was missing something. I want my money back... ♥♥♥♥ing TERRIBLE.			"

At it's current state, it is very hard to recommend it, the game is very glitchy, has very low textures, and it only has three maps to choose from... Really? Only three! I mean was it too much to ask for a game that was better than a game from 2002, and 2004 repectively. I really hope Atari can turn this game around before full launch.			"

								If a player keeps from viewing others' views and opinions and allows an open mind before entering this world, then I think they can find themselves having an adequate time playing for a few hours. This goes especially to those players intending to do super-basic stuff like building basic rides, planting basic scenery, do minimal to no landscaping, etc.But when a game has so many glitches, so much lag, and so many errors and incomplete aspects within it, you have to sit and wonder who's bright idea it was to release this horrifically broken piece of software at the price of a full-fledged, fully-built, fully-complete-and-ready-to-sell-to-the-masses video game. I understand the game is listed as ""Early Alpha,"" so this should be expected, but coming from a video game that was originally intended to be released summer of last year, I was at least hoping for it to be polished enough for more serious gameplay.I found the game okay to play at first and that the reviews many YouTube gamers were giving it to be just a tad bit exaggerated. But do heed their words, and do heed the words of the ""Mostly Negative"" reviews found on the Steam Page. In the end, it's really not worth it.I intend to keep my copy to play at another date and hope that they will improve it over time, but it will likely gather dust now and then until I feel ready to suffer through the tremendous lag and superabundant number of peeps puking for my generic janitors to clean. Your $50 could be better spent elsewhere. I promise, I promise...			"

I understand that this is a prerelease but they have had plenty of time to provide us with a better game than this. The fact that they are acctually charging money for this is insane. They should be ashamed of making people pay to play this terrible game. Since I have  already had to pay for this, I will attempt to play this again once the full release comes out, but till then I'm not gonna give myself a headache fighting a coaster builder that DOESN'T WORK!!!!

								I loved these games.. but unfortunatly this game is TERRIBLE currently. The frame rate drops are ridiculous and it lags so bad once you get 2000+ guests in your park. It has a terrible game breaking bug that causes your mechanics and staff to get stuck at the exit of a ride when trying to repair it - or they get stuck trying to leave their building... so guess what! nothing can get fixed and your park becomes a horrible disaster that servers nothing but food and overpriced toilet use. You can pick them up, but then they teleport back to the spot they were stuck in. Also any roller coaster you have causes EVERY single person to puke when they get off... yes EVERY SINGLE ONE. So your guests are never happy when leaving a ride (after puking themselves) and walking through a mountain of every other persons vomit in the park. The cleaning staff cannot keep up unless you over-hire and cause yourself to go bankrupt from staff wages. WAIT UNTIL THE GAME IS NOT IN EARLY ACCESS TO PURCHASE!! unless you want to pay for a game with a new glitch or bug around every corner and you end up refunding it anyways from pure frustration.			"

								This game is terrible. It still is nowhere near release. You can't edit hardly anything on the pre-built rides, coasters, and structures. The peep graphics are choppy at any eye height beyond right over top of them. The coaster building interface is junk - it lets you build ridiculous track segments while defying logic and sense. The graphics are poor - RCT3 was better. The on ride cameras are choppy when turning or changing slope - very poor. You can't see the ride increase or decrease speed either, it always looks like it's going the same speed. The building system overall is bad, clunky, impossible to place things where you want them. The game is so far from ready, and there doesn't seem to be any promising sign that it's going to get any better. This is all coming from a very disappointed, huge RCT fan from day 1. Bummer.			"

								This game does not deserve to have the RollerCoaster Tycoon name attached to it. It is awful in every element of the ""game"". Sure this is Early Access but that is NO excuse for this horrible ""game"". This has been a failing project for years. The current screenshots all look good but then you get in the ""game"" (which is just over 1gb) and put all the settings on high, you still get something that looks worse than RCT 3 does and that game is 10 years old! Artai has been money hungry for years turning well known IP's into new, totally garbage games and RCTW is no different. A few things wrong with it:-Sound design (want to hear some adults only bedroom noises? Zoom into the coaster stations)-UI (everything is just wrong. Not user friendly, way to big, hard to navigate, etc)-Peeps are a joke. You will find quite a few that look the same. They don't walk right. Loading into rides is awful-Gameplay is just horrid. I had to force myself to play for an hour trying to find something good about it and there is nothing. -Graphics are awful-Just no fun at allAs soon as the negative feedback started rolling in on the forums, threads were getting deleted. You mention Planet Coaster on the forums (even when trying to compare the games to give Atari ideas), you get the whole thread deleted. Atari has become a massive joke and I will never buy another game from them again. It's a real shame that they have the rights to Roller Coaster Tycoon because I would love to see what a real game development company could do with this beloved series. Unforutnally I think it is to late and the RCT name has been tarnished by this total hunk of garbage they call a ""game"".			"

								As a long time fan of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, it really sucks that I have to give this review. I've been patient, given Atari plenty of leniency after reading all of their blog posts, and I actually bought the game expecting to get something that's at least enjoyable to play. (Luckily I got it for $30AU elsewhere)Sadly, that is not the case. After months of broken promises of the full release of the game, we get this steaming hot mess in Early Access instead. And it's not fun.The peeps look horrendous and the animations are all awkward, and there are quite a few instances where staff will appear to glide across the map. When you scroll out completely the peeps look like pixels moving jaggedly.The coaster builder, while innovative, is really not that pleasant to work with. While I enjoy being offered more flexibility in building a roller coaster, I still have a very hard time getting the pieces to work just how I want them to, and it doesn't integrate well with the piece-by-piece builder - which, by the way, doesn't have the option to place pre-built banked curves. Moreover, there's no way to change the speed of a whole section of chain lift at the same time - Why isn't this feature present here when it was present in all previous RCT games.The stalls are oversized, the transition from individual staff to staff-rooms is terrible, the path system, while innovate, also lacks from terrible implementation and lack of piece-by-piece building, the rides look tacky, blah blah blah...I could go on for ages, but to sum it up, it's...not fun to play at all. I'm not vibing it like I did with the first 3 installments, and I honestly would have faith in this game, but considering the amount of times Atari's been blowing smoke up our♥♥♥♥♥ I can't give credit to anything they say anymore. AAA game my♥♥♥♥♥ Mattlab.I could only justify buying the game if it was $10, but that's stretching it. Don't waste your time on this game right now. If you have a real itch to immerse yourself in a beautiful theme park sim, fork out the extra money for Planet Coaster.			"

Early Access Review
								I really really wanted to like this game, and now after playing the PlanetCoaster alpha early release I may be a bit clouded but this game lacks improvement, and growth after such a long time of un-comparable theme park sim/roller coaster park simulations. You know you have problems when a really early PlanetCoaster build is far more polished and feature rich than RollerCoaster Tycoon Worlds beta early build.All of the comments and opinions I have are with me knowing that yes it is an early access/release. Although I know this, it really isn't an excuse considering we have passed the original full game release date, and second full game release date.RollerCoaster Tycoon World severely lacks customization, and depth. Everything about it seems dull, and dumb (not like this game is dumb, but nothing in it seems smart, guests, employees, rides, etc). Everything just seems like its moving a long a set path with no real logic or process to give it a unique feel. Guests still hover around as if they are on an inviseable hovercraft, they are generic, and not very creative. There is no joy in the guests eyes, just walking ""sticks"".The rides look quite a bit better than the previous incarnation of RCT, but still lack a bit of a real feel, and detail. It is almost like they took what made the rides tick in RCT3, and threw a new graphic on them. IN theme parks/amusement parks some rides in a park will be the same ole spin and go up and down, but other rides do not necessarily have a pattern to them. I may be splitting hairs here, but after so many years what did you bring us that was new and imaginative? Not much.Objects, paths and scenary are a pain in the butt to use. Paths are finicky on where they can connect to each other, and you will find sceneary won't attach in that one special spot you saved open just for that particular piece of scenary. Unless you are a master of the poorly implemented way to use the paths tool, or plop sceneary expect to be spending a lot of time deleting things, replacing paths, and starting over on parts of the park if you are a detail oriented person. I could go on for awhile, but I will just say this.The game lacks depth, and ties you up in regards to creativity, and customization. If you are happy with just throwing down rides, making money on peeps, and cleaning up garbage, then you may not think this is to bad of a game, but to be honest there are better games that are 12+ years older than this one that will give you that experience. I don't feel like I wasted my money as I still hope the devs put it into high gear and turn this franchise around, but it is really looking bleak at this point. They have a whole heck of a lot of work ahead and them if they want this franchise to survive. I have a feeling though they pretty much just killed it. The new champions of the theme park tycoon series I have a feeling isn't going to be Atari.			"

Early Access Review
								We can take for granted that an early access game will be rough round the edges, and we must be prepared for plenty of quirks and bugs. However one has to wonder just how far into the development this game is, when core functionality is so fundamentally broken. Take as an example, when you begin a campaign, besides a extreme stutter, which I will get into shortly, after picking one of just three areas to start in, you will often find yourself with only one build option; rides. Granted, the intention is of course that different creation options will unlock for you as you progress in the game, however on numerous occasions, besides the rides category, the other options would unlock much later than necessary (that is assuming they ever unlock). Like in the previous Rollercoaster Tycoon games, you need to place rides and shops far enough from the paths to provide space for a substantial length of an entrance queue. After placing a number of rides, you may notice that you have no means of drawing a path to them. What this leads to is hundreds of visitors entering the park after paying the £5 entrance fee, merely to walk back and forth on the small stretch of preset pathway at the entrace, getting increasingly tired and frustrated, and feeling understandably ripped off. To make things worse, if you have opened those rides in the vain hope that these visitors will get off the beaten path and make the trek across the grass to ride the helter skelter (heads up: they won't), soon enough the rides will inevitably break down simply from normal test usage. Nevermind, you can get mechanics on the job because it looks like the Buildings category finally opened up! Oh wait, you can't build a pathway. Right, that's really brought things to a halt.The interface adds insult to injury when notifications pop up, giving you a series of requests like ""hey, it's kinda dark, can you please add some lamps?"" or ""hey your customers can't get to this ride, can you build a pathway to it?"", and ""hey, your ride has broken down, can you get your mechanics on it?"" - And my response to them all is ""I WOULD IF YOU LET ME!"".In spite of this locked interface bug occurring a couple of times for me, I was lucky enough to start a campaign where the interface did function normally, and all the features unlocked for me within a reasonable time, more or less consistently. Besides the slightly cumbersome building/ride rotation mechanic (an 8 way snapping rotation would be preferable), and the fact that the auto rotation assignment (based upon the path you are placing the building next to) works less than half the time, the game actually feels surprisingly functional in spite of those finnicky issues. As for the coaster creation, it is fantastic! I had a blast designing an intricate coaster with ease. However it can be a little tedious to keep testing the ride every time you make a change to ensure that it works. It would be preferable if there were a feature that allowed you to simply test the last segment that you added, rather than the whole ride from the begining. Indeed, it does not seem to be far-fetched to assume a finished product could be comparable to Cities: Skylines in terms of quality and design. There will undoubtedly need to be a lot more in the way of content, as there is not even close to the amount of building and ride option or design variation compared with the previous Rollercoaster Tycoon games- but of course a lack of content is to be expected in early access. Perhaps one thing which really leaves a gaping hole, is the lack of in-depth creation. For example, the paths are laid with a line-drawing tool rather than a grid system which prevents creating little patio areas or plazas by hand, forcing you to use the preset ones. I am not sufficiently convinced that this will be changed in future patches or indeed upon the final game's release, because the Tycoon game industry seems to be moving towards this more ""accessible"" route, at the cost of player's creativity. I noticed this with Thrillville and Zoo Tycoon and other games of this style, but I would love Rollercoaster Tycoon World to prove me wrong and break away from this trend. I mentioned before that the game was stuttering. Although my PC's hardware is decidedly outdated for this 'generation', the parts exceeded the minimum and recommended specs for the game. For perspective, I can run Cities Skylines on Very High settings with smooth and responsive performance, even when my city spans across 5 regions and is filled with tens of thousands of people. I can also run Grand Theft Auto V at very high settings at around 50FPS. So, I cannot say I was not disappointed that the performance for Rollercoaster Tycoon World is abysmal. The game is not bad looking (though I'd argue not nearly as attractive or impressive as Cities Skylines), it is perhaps the best looking theme park tycoon game, and to be honest, it is a more up-close and personal style of tycoon game, with far more attention to detail than others in the same vein, with a naturally more dynamic environment. When you zoom into your park, you can get a lot closer than many tycoon games usually allow, and you can witness how the branches of palm trees sway in the wind,  a person behind the desk at a ride's entrace with the ride's buttons and controls, and see the little gate swing open for the customers, see kids running with excitement holding the balloons or other souvenirs they bought, etc. I expect that the finished product will look beautiful with just a hint of polish here and there, and perhaps a bit more detail in buildings and shops (most of the shops are identicle besides the large mascot/statue on the top). I would, for example, to see t shirts actually displayed in the window of the t shirt shops, and fridges with drinks actually displayed in the drink stalls, and burgers being made in the burger stalls. I recall the game The Movies by Lionhead allowed you to zoom into a burger stall and see a man actually cooking the individual burgers.... that was over a decade ago, so I am sure that in the $CURRENT_YEAR, it shouldn't be too much to request that the team behind RCTW are able to put at least a similar amount of effort into detail that Lionhead was able to achieve 11 years ago. But sadly, even if they did, that would only make the performance issues worse. It is already extremely uncomfortable for people who even meet the recommended system requirements, and even more-so when you choose to speed-up time. Freezes, unresponsive UI and generally horrendous stutter are present even on lower graphics settings. In conclusion, there is a lot that needs to be fixed and improved. I would certainly recommend fanatics of the franchise to get the early access game if they have ridiculously strong hardware, as when the game GUI is not misbehaving, the game shows a lot of promise and it is certainly quite enjoyable. I apologise if most of the review is criticizing rather than praising, but I felt that the negative did outweigh the positive for the most part. So, unless you fall into the category of ""fanatic with future-proofed hardware"", avoid the game for now but keep your eye on it, as I expect great things to come. If by the game release, there is a solution to whatever is undermining performance, the content is greatly expanded upon, the visuals are a little more refined, there is more free-rein and features that enable creativity and of course providing the remaining bugs are ironed out, I have no doubt that this game could be absolutely amazing. Especially with Steam Workshop support. Don't let us down, people, you know what you need to do!			"

								While leaps and bounds better than what they threw at us back in October, this game is still lacking any sort of strong feeling. If anything, this is what they should have started with. While all the features are there, even more bugs are present. Paths to not work properly, peeps look awful, the camera feels worse than a classic N64 camera. Coaster builder again, while much much better, is still a disaster, and the camera doesn't make trying to build exactly the way you want it any easier. Placing a premade track piece, and then going into freeform mode causes the previous piece to deform and angle awkwardly. Nothing is very streamlined at this point.I have not tried anything else other than placing a few flat rides and staff buildings (another thing that shouldn't have been included, as it takes up already insufficient space); because the game crashed when trying to change the options.This game needs at LEAST another 8 months in development to get everything sorted out, and done right.As many have already said, Planet Coaster is already 1000x what this is looking to be. I hate to be one to compare between two different games, but it's really true. If you want a good Theme Park simulator, or even just want to be able to build cool, interesting (not to mention large) coasters, RCTW is not for you. Hats off to Nvizzio for trying, but you've missed the mark for a second time.Cheers everyone, see you in Planet CoasterUpdated 11-23-2016: Felt like giving this game another go, since surely the extra months would help right? Wrong, so very wrong. You think they spent that extra time working on this game, wrong again. They decided ""Hey RCTW is already horrible so lets use that money we scammed dedicated fans to develop another mobile game!""Upon trying to start up the game, it crashed. 8 times. Needless to say I will never be installing this game again. Atari, what happened to you?			"

Also, the path construction is terrible.  Not only do you end up with a ton of crooked paths but no one will walk down them.  I know it's an early release but I seriously want my money back.  :(			"

								So I decided to ignore all the bad reviews, and buy into a franchise that I have grown up with (I think RCT 1 was the first ever game I bought on PC), and like everyone else, I am bitterly dissapointed.I got the bug where the game crashes at 57%, followed Seifer's guide, and fixed that. Brilliant, now I can play the game. Nope. All I can see is a pink screen. Followed another guide by Seifer, and this fixed the pink screen. Brilliant, now I can play the game. Nope. Every time I go to place a ride, I have to have it elevated by 8-9m before it will recognise a valid placement, meaning I can only create parks on stilts. I don't even care about the graphics or lag or how it doesn't offer as much as RCT3 or all the other complaints. I just want a game that works. I spent £30 to be met with constant crashes and errors. My play time is so low because the game just won't work.  "

								In it's current state, I simply cannot recommend this. Being an RCT vet, playing all the previous games, I was very happy to learn that they were releasing a reboot to this franchise that I hold dear. While I do still have some hope that this will be a great game at full release (assuming it doesn't get stuck in pre-release limbo), the game has too many problems right now, ranging from very bad staff AI to terrain sculpting bugs, lack of customization for rides and coasters, to very barebones instructions for what you have to do.The one somewhat redeemable feature is the coaster builder. After some headaches figuring out how to use it (again, the game does not explain very well how to do so), I was able to build a pretty sweet coaster looping around a lake with plenty of inversions, loops, and the like. If they can get the AI fixed and bring back all the customization for rides from the previous games, this could still be a good game. Then again, maybe that's why they added mod support.Anyway, it's at most a 4/10 right now. Save your money for now.			"

								I know the game is only in Early Access, but it was originally set to release in early 2015. I've been a longtime fan of the RollerCoaster Tycoon franchise, but unfortunatley, this game is major letdown and disgrace to the RollerCoaster Tycoon name. Maybe someday this game will reach a point where it is polished and refined, but currently, I would strongly discourage anyone from purchasing it.			"

								I have been a die hard RCT fan my whole life. I still play RCT3 all the time, 12 years after its release. I have been following RCTW since it was first roumered, and I was extremely excited for it. I had waited over a decade for a new RCT installment, so you can imagine my anticipation for this game. I am sad to say that this game is not good. I was okay with it being released in early access rather than a finished game, but it isn't even close to ready. I was expecting all of the features of RCT3, plus a plethera of new features, rides, scenery, interface, and better graphics. This game has none of that. It is basically a stripped down version of RCT3. There are hardly any rides, there are less themes than there were in previous games, the graphics are bad, and it is poorly optimized (it freezed and lags on my PC that can play virtually any game on ultra settings). On top of all that, the path system and the terrain system are totally broken. They claim to fix it them in every update, but it still doesnt work. The best part about the RCT series was that you were able to imagine a dream park, and then build that exact park. RCTW doesn't let you do that, and most final products come out uglier and more awkward looking than you imagined. As of right now, I cannot recommend this game. I don't know what Atari was thinking charging $50 for a game that is years away from being complete. If I were you, I would pre-order Planet Coaster. It looks like they will be releasing a complete game with all the features we want.  "

								As a huge RCT fan, this is a tough one. On one hand this game is (head scratchingly) in early access. On the other hand, they've had multiple games in the series to pull from in terms of content and roadmapping as well as several delays before the official release date. As an early access game, it's not bad. It's completely playable with the money and simulation basics in there to actually run a park.However, as an RCT game it is a major letdown. We were promised an evolution in the series and what's here is simply the framework for the next step. Is that a bad thing? Not exactly, if something isn't broke then don't fix it. But it's nowhere near what Planet Coaster is doing. Right now you have 3 themes and over half of the scenery/props are locked. I'm not sure if they are locked behind some sort of in-game system or locked out because they aren't finished yet... the game doesn't say. My park ran smoothly enough for me but after I had built 3 coasters and 8 flat rides, I had 1,300 peeps in my park. At one point my menu disappeared so I had to exit out and reload from the main menu. After it sluggishly reloaded, the framerate was in the single digits. Making it unplayable in my eyes.As for the coaster builder, I didn't care for it much at first. I made a clunky and ugly first coaster. The second was a bit better and the third was almost exactly what I wanted. It's not a bad system and I actually think it works great once you learn how to use it. You can attach set pieces, just like in the older RCT games, or you can go off the grid and make whatever you want! You just have to play with it. So, the coaster builder is on the short list of positives for this game.The biggest problems I see right now is the amount of content, lack of in depth management tools (staff management, etc.), ugly peeps, and poor optimization. Luckily these are things that can be addressed and fixed. The menus aren't particularly eye pleasing but that's not a big deal.Also, the mission objectives that are given to you in game are so HUGE they sometimes occupy 75% of the screen so you can't look at the tasks while playing with your park. You have to look at them, close it out, try to finish the task, then open it back up to see the next one. It's mind bogglingly annoying!The truth is that there is a lot of potential here but right now it's not worth the asking price. Wait for a sale or the full version to see if they can polish this up a bit.			"

								As of now I do not recommend it.The performance is poor when you make a big park and there is a huge lack in available amusements which are NOT rollercoasters. Furthermore, building roads can be VERY difficult since it often wants to snap to another place that's somewhere else.If you don't mind these things then go ahead and buy it. But I do not like it as much as I like Rollercoaster Tycoon 3. And it's nowhere near worth the price of 45 euro.			"

								I bought this game long time ago and all negative reviews are true this is a very sub standerd, in my opinion even unplayable, game. However ATARI is very generous in refunding the money releasing in early acces long after the promised release date. Here comes my real problem, steam isn't giving back the refund to their customers. The reason they give is that they can't pay out money spend so long ago. Wich is a strange reason since in this case buying a long time ago is  one of the main gounds for the refund. There are enough ways to pay back this money and in my opinion this makes it stealing from your customers. So my advise NEVER buy something on steam you can't try out immediately because even when the developer grants you a refund steam will not give you back your money.			"

												This is no Rollercoaster Tycoon  1 & 2 but it is a much improved RCT 3. As this is a Beta I dont wanna compare this to any full released game, I love these types of games and for me the wait of 10 years for a new one is far too long, I have played 5 hours so far and im mostly pleased, yes we have bugs, yes the building off a coaster is tricky to understand to begin with, but as this is a next gen RCT you can expect a more realistic feel to building a theme park.  The physics of the building on a coaster is demanding and you do need to thing about physics of bends, speed, gforce etc, so lets hope they can improve the buidling system, maybe some instructions to help people who are having trouble.

Early Access Review
								At first glance (30 mins in) I am a bit disapointed. Remembering though that it is EARLY ACCESS - but also remembering that they were going to release the game about now as 'finished'.Definitly not a finished game. Graphic issues everywhere. Glitchy and lots of clipping around the place. Peeps tend to hover and not walk about. Staff members do the same. Paths clip. The on-coaster Cam needs a fair bit of work - there is no detail in the coaster, but the scenery is good looking a far.The ambience is a bit quiet or sterile so far. It seems pretty dull for a theme park, even with a few hundred people in. You dont hear the hum of people, just the random moans and screams of some ladies - which sounds like pornography tbh. And lots of money cha-ching noises from your rides. I was expecting a bit more immersion and realism.At this stage I'm on the fence. Im not excited but it has some potential. I am considering a refund and trying Planet Coaster Alpha instead - it looks more polished. I would give it probably a 5.5 to a 6/10 in its current state, but I will give it more of a go over the next few days and update. My advice though... is to wait. The Atari team could turn this around and make it into something great.*UPDATE* I gave this game a really good go and played for a few hours and have decided on requesting a refund. Already I feel I have played enough and done everything. It doesnt feel like an RCT game - theres no atmosphere. The coaster builder and camera is also horrible and VERY hard to use. 3hrs into the game and I dont feel like playing anymore - now you all know thats not right - not to mention my fingers are sore from clicking (the bulldose system sucks too).I may consider re-purchasing down the track if there are some significant improvements, but until then, the Planet Coaster Alpha actually looks a lot better than this is in its current state, so Id suggest at least taking a peek at that. The best way to describe it is: RCTW = SimCity 5 (a major let down). Im hoping Planet Coaster = City Skylines.			"

												So I played the game over the weekend pretty much none stop and I can say I was super excited about this game. The graphics are pretty awesome.I like some of the news things they have put into this game but it still is nothing like the original. Which to me this is a good and bad thing. It is great that we have so much more customization to this game. Circle paths, large, small, medium paths, lights, trash cans, benches, etc.I enjoy the fact that you can make a roller coaster now almost as you wish and it is not constrained as it was in the old Roller Coaster Tycoon. But with that being said, the magic of the old games is not completely present here.I want to build a roller-caster, test, add my scenery, my queue and be off. I don't want to spend almost 2 hours on building a coaster and than not be able to finish it because my train car is always hitting a bar that was placed in the wrong area by the game. I don't want to spend close to an hour and a half just to complete laying out my track. I want to put able to select the section of the track and place it how I like. There are alot of advantages to this new UI and I do recognize them but I am not a roller coaster designer. I am a average player that wants to build a roller coaster in the game as quickly and have it enjoyable. At the point, it is not that enjoyable to build a roller coaster because it is super frustrating.Here is an example on why it is so frustrating, If I am building my roller coaster and I am zoomed out to see what it looks like. If I click on a portion of the map where i would like for my track to be laid, that game from now where lays a very large piece of track randomly that the end of the new piece of track is laid down all the way to the edge of the park. WHAT?!!!!! That is not what I wanted. Now I have to zoom back in to make the track smaller, than angle the camera just right, and than either shift and any of the 4 number to adjust the track as I want. That is just ridiculous.If you are going to show a grid, as I like building on a grid, don't give me just a small piece of grid. Just display it on the whole map.For sure there is a learning curve for this game. But so far my initial review of this game is not all the stellar when building coaster. This is something that is NOT going to change for this is pretty much the hole core of the game.I am still at a maybe..... I wouldn't recommend this game but at the same time if you are a die hard fan as I am, I wouldn't turn you away either.			"

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWSo here is the thing, I love this series, all the way from RCT to RCT3 and the process that this game took to get here caused me to cancel my pre-order, buy Planet Coaster and play it on release date. However after the launch I got curious and re-purchased the game and here is what I think....NVIZZIO HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO!!!!Pro's:Well it feels like it tries to be RCTArea themes are goodand well in my opinion that's about it for pro'sCons:*UPDATED 16/9/2016*THE COASTER BUILDER IS A LOAD OF BULL - How did you screw this up??? Press 1 and scroll mouse wheel to raise and lower, press 2 and scroll mouse wheel to tilt, press 3 and scroll mouse wheel to pitch and pressing 4 and you guessed it scroll that mouse wheel and it does something else. This is the WORST coaster builder I have used, its just so clunky and time consuming compared to, dare I say it, Planet Coaster's which they hid in Beta due to they thought it wasn't great but let me tell you it is the quickest precise builder I have used. It systems don't fully work, I struggled to get two trains running on one track, it kept failing with no information on how to fix it, the coaster preview while building is clunky, you click to build and then the preview of the next piece dissapears, it only reappears once you click and then click to build again. It's just pretty much, in my opinion, the worst coaster builder I have ever used.THE RIDES - Okay I get it realism is in but they just don't feel real and oh no the signs, the terrible ride signs. Yes you can rename and it shows up on the sign but there is just no character to them. It feels robotic and no this wasn't a sci fi theme.THE GRAPHICS - Just no, this is not 2016 worthy level of graphics, I can see that maybe you were trying to capture the feel of RCT3, or it's just an ""optimization"" thing but seriously that's why the game was delayed and it STILL SUCKS.********************************NEW**************************************************** THE LOAD TIME - Oh I could make a cup of tea and drop it onto my expensive PC by the time finally kicks itself into gear and you know the fun part?? Becaus of how great Unity is, if your graphics settings are incorrect or you want to tweak, you have to EXIT YOUR PARK, do the tweaks and then you guesssed it, WAIT FOR THE THING TO FREAKIN LOAD AGAIN!!!PATCH CONTENT - I'm getting increasingly worried now, it's been a few months out now in the world of play testing and I'm really not seeing improvements. Yes more rides and buildings have been added, do they look nice and attractive? No, graphic style has not had an update, it still looks like poop and zoom out and all your peeps become pixels that jutter to their destination. They released grid building and customisable buildings, but Planet Coaster had that from day one! Too late on that part, whether it was always part of the plan or added so that the game could keep the players it still has, whatever the reason it was too late and, in my opinion, badly done.Just general things don't seem to be improving, comparing it to Parkitecht and Planet Coaster whose updates have been consistent and fix bugs but add new exciting features and improve graphical quality all the time. They seem to be striving for the best while RCTW seems to be hanging on to the lifesaver surrounded by sharks.Below is my original closer and it still stands apart from my belief now that this game will never be at that high standard, in fact my belief is that the developers have given up. They are making this to an acceptable level where they can retain maybe a few people but enough so that Atari aren't on their backs and then dumped, never to be updated again for the trouble it has caused. Somewhere inside me, for the sake of the name of RCT, I hope I'm wrong.**********************************************************************************************This game could have been great, COULD HAVE BEEN, but competition in the market from Planet Coaster and even Parkitecht did not do this game well. I mean Planet Coaster literally beats it on every level, yes it has flaws but that's what development time is for, RCTW HAS HAD 3 F***ING YEARS TO GET THIS RIGHT AND 3 DEVELOPERS. Seriously get this game to the high standard it now has to live up to or congrats to Nvizzio for killing off one of the most beloved franchises of Theme Park building.			"

I would be happy to blame my computer, but when I play MMO's with all the graphics on high quality and have them run smoothly, I doubt that's it. Because it's so slow, everything is glitch. Camera angles are impossible to control well, rides and pathways can't be placed easily. I'm hoping it gets better.			"

Early Access Review
								Edit: The RCTW developers have actually been very proactive in communicating with the community and fixing what needs to be fixed. Since this review was written, there have been several bug fixes and graphical improvements made to the game. While the game still has it's slew of bugs and some needed changes to gameplay (the path system still sucks but they're working on a redesign), it is better than when it first launched. While I still can't recommend this game in it's current state, I have no doubt that if Nvissio continues to act on the feedback of the players, this will actually turn into a worthy successor in the RCT franchise.Graphics: 6/10 Better looking than its twelve year old predecessor, but still dated for 2016 Gameplay: 4/10While the coaster builder is fun, bugs and minor annoyances detract from its overall enjoyment and poor optimization means even the most powerful computer might only scratch 15 fps.Series Innovation: 5/10While a lot was added to this entry (fully customizable coaster builder, restaurants, curved and larger size paths) a lot was also taken away. The amount of rides and coaster styles you can build is less than what it was in its predecessors, and you can’t build rides that go underground or roller coasters that don’t connect to the end (e.g shuttle loops).Overall: 5/10Rollercoaster Tycoon World (RCTW) has the potential to be a worthy addition to the famed Rollercoaster Tycoon (RCT) series, but in it's current state it's bogged down by bugs, missing features, and a stack of minor annoyances which shouldn't exist in a game after two years of development.I absolutely loved the first three RCT games and in 2014 when RCTW was first announced I was excited to see what the newest game could bring after ten years of new and improved gaming technology. Then the original developer was replaced, and the replacement developer was also replaced and the release date for RCTW kept getting pushed back from its initial “early 2015” date. Finally, at the end of Q1 in 2016, Nvissio and Atari released their Early Access Beta, a year after originally planned, and still not the final release. After playing RCTW for a couple of hours, I must say that I am somewhat disappointed in the progress that has been made after two years. While the graphics are improved from it’s predecessor, RCT3, the game does look dated for 2016 and what game engines and computers are capable of (at a 1GB download I was kind of expecting that). Polygon reduction when zooming out is very noticeable, and trees go from leafy to a three shaded blob without any middleground. Additionally, the park visitors just look kind of… weird. They have a tendency to run almost wildly flailing their arms which just looks funny and the look only marginally better than their now twelve year senior counterparts. Rides on the other hand do look much better than back in 2004, but look more like they would be in a game released four or five years ago, not now.The game is hampered by a number of bugs, with many people reporting that the game won’t load past 57% ( I have not had this issue myself). Additionally, there are issues with the game freezing and crashing at random times during gameplay, and on the “Frolicking Forest” map, the terrain editor only removes the polygons of the terrain and you still can’t place paths or rides unless they are above the previous terrain height.Gameplay wise, it’s actually kind of fun but there are a lot of annoyances that really cut away at it after only a few minutes. The coaster builder is pretty fun, but it’s also pretty hard to just get a straight line out of it. It would also benefit from having a stand alone coaster builder built into the game instead of only having the option to load a map and build it during a game. Additionally, for a “beta” there is a wide variety of shops and stalls, but it is very limited ride wise, with only a handful of roller coaster styles and a few different “flat rides” with varying scenery to choose from which seems interesting considering it’s a game built around building rides at its core. Additionally, the roller coasters have to connect, no more building shuttle loops for an easy payday. The main annoyance that’s been plaguing me is that there is no area demolish. Every bush, shrub, and tree that is there when the map loads needs to be individually clicked on to destroy, with is rather tedious. I do like that there are now larger paths that can be built, but there are times when the game won’t let me make a straight path, especially when making a short path that connects to another path. Another annoyance is that you have to build shops and stalls offset from the main path, and have to build a path to connect it to the main path which adds in an extra step and is also tedious, especially when your path doesn’t want to just go straight.Playing RCTW, you can see hints of the potential that this entry has, and with some polish and more development work, I do think that this can be a good game. However, with the way Atari has been treating this game over the past two years, I don’t really believe any major amount of progress will be made, and the game will forever be one of those “What could have been” examples.

Early Access Review
								Edit: The RCTW developers have actually been very proactive in communicating with the community and fixing what needs to be fixed. Since this review was written, there have been several bug fixes and graphical improvements made to the game. While the game still has it's slew of bugs and some needed changes to gameplay (the path system still sucks but they're working on a redesign), it is better than when it first launched. While I still can't recommend this game in it's current state, I have no doubt that if Nvissio continues to act on the feedback of the players, this will actually turn into a worthy successor in the RCT franchise.Graphics: 6/10 Better looking than its twelve year old predecessor, but still dated for 2016 Gameplay: 4/10While the coaster builder is fun, bugs and minor annoyances detract from its overall enjoyment and poor optimization means even the most powerful computer might only scratch 15 fps.Series Innovation: 5/10While a lot was added to this entry (fully customizable coaster builder, restaurants, curved and larger size paths) a lot was also taken away. The amount of rides and coaster styles you can build is less than what it was in its predecessors, and you can’t build rides that go underground or roller coasters that don’t connect to the end (e.g shuttle loops).Overall: 5/10Rollercoaster Tycoon World (RCTW) has the potential to be a worthy addition to the famed Rollercoaster Tycoon (RCT) series, but in it's current state it's bogged down by bugs, missing features, and a stack of minor annoyances which shouldn't exist in a game after two years of development.I absolutely loved the first three RCT games and in 2014 when RCTW was first announced I was excited to see what the newest game could bring after ten years of new and improved gaming technology. Then the original developer was replaced, and the replacement developer was also replaced and the release date for RCTW kept getting pushed back from its initial “early 2015” date. Finally, at the end of Q1 in 2016, Nvissio and Atari released their Early Access Beta, a year after originally planned, and still not the final release. After playing RCTW for a couple of hours, I must say that I am somewhat disappointed in the progress that has been made after two years. While the graphics are improved from it’s predecessor, RCT3, the game does look dated for 2016 and what game engines and computers are capable of (at a 1GB download I was kind of expecting that). Polygon reduction when zooming out is very noticeable, and trees go from leafy to a three shaded blob without any middleground. Additionally, the park visitors just look kind of… weird. They have a tendency to run almost wildly flailing their arms which just looks funny and the look only marginally better than their now twelve year senior counterparts. Rides on the other hand do look much better than back in 2004, but look more like they would be in a game released four or five years ago, not now.The game is hampered by a number of bugs, with many people reporting that the game won’t load past 57% ( I have not had this issue myself). Additionally, there are issues with the game freezing and crashing at random times during gameplay, and on the “Frolicking Forest” map, the terrain editor only removes the polygons of the terrain and you still can’t place paths or rides unless they are above the previous terrain height.Gameplay wise, it’s actually kind of fun but there are a lot of annoyances that really cut away at it after only a few minutes. The coaster builder is pretty fun, but it’s also pretty hard to just get a straight line out of it. It would also benefit from having a stand alone coaster builder built into the game instead of only having the option to load a map and build it during a game. Additionally, for a “beta” there is a wide variety of shops and stalls, but it is very limited ride wise, with only a handful of roller coaster styles and a few different “flat rides” with varying scenery to choose from which seems interesting considering it’s a game built around building rides at its core. Additionally, the roller coasters have to connect, no more building shuttle loops for an easy payday. The main annoyance that’s been plaguing me is that there is no area demolish. Every bush, shrub, and tree that is there when the map loads needs to be individually clicked on to destroy, with is rather tedious.

Early Access Review
								This game still has a lot of problems. At this moment it's really an early access. There are really some good things about the game, the way you can design you're own rollercoasters looks good and is fun to play with. The paths are a lot better than in RTC3, you kan now make corners and lay them down as you like them, make them bigger or smaller.It works and looks OK, but it does not make me really excited about the game yet.The controls are really bad. Most is done through the keyboard, it works but the right combination of mouse and keyboard makes it really easy to control.The mouse controls you have like zooming in with the scroll wheal is way to sensitive. When giving it a single little scroll it goes all the way down or up. Maybe it's a setting, but I would expect this to work like it should with basic settings. I have found the side screen scrolling with the mouse, so that makes it somewhat better, but overall the controls are really not great yet. The graphics are not great, it looks OK, but it's not the graphics you expect from a game today. Beside that it the graphical performance is not so good. Lot's of frame rate drops.Peeps are sometimes walking of the paths trough bushes and trees and some look like there are floating over the path.Sounds are missing from peeps when you ride allong. Sometimes when you ride allong with a rollercoaster you keep hearing the lift chain all the way in the ride.But at the other hand I think this game can have a lot of potential, but it does have a long way to go.If they make the graphics better and put some time in bug fixing, better controls and some more content and senarios to play it really can be a nice game to play.I would not recommend the game yet at this moment, the main reason for this is especially the price and what you get for it at the moment. On the other hand, if they will really make the game a lot better to play in the upcomming months with more content and features without extra costs the price is acceptable, but that's is something you will only know in time.

												I remember how much I loved playing RollerCoaster Tycoon when I was a kid. So many good memories ! Last week I learned that there was a new game of Roller Coaster ! So cool ! So happy ! Yay for the nostagical me ! But...This game is a complete waste of money and time. After only two hours of playing, the game just stoped working. (I was at the « Influencer challenge », you know, when you have to buy a souvenir shop for kids ?) Okay, this happens sometimes. I tried launching the game again. After clicking « resume », it stoped working. Okay... Maybe something wrong happened. I tried launching another park. Same thing. I even desinstalled the game and reinstalled it. Rebooting my computer. (which is not the problem, since I just bought it a few months ago) Same thing. Plus, the game isn't THAT good either and I am so bored with the bugs. Really, I do not recommend this game. I asked for a refund, since I just bought this game last week. I hope I will receive the money back soon. Right now I am downloading Planet Coaster, and I hope for a better experience ! A review of Planet Coaster will follow.			"

												Just don't buy it. I'd love a refund, but whatever I'll just leave my thumb down review here instead... The game is simply impossible to play properly. I purchased it while the early access and it was full of glitches, game would crash when the park was getting loaded. It was early access, so i told myself alright just wait a few months and try play it again later.And here I am, a few months later. I start the game and it's still full of glitches or annoying things. Again, the game freezes randomly, or when I try modify the keys setting. I also started to play the sandbox mode, and the camera got stuck out of the park, and I cannot move it at all. I mean, come on... I tried everything in game, I am just stuck : http://puu.sh/sYbbR/209bc06304.jpgI also let my nephew play the game a few hours, I think he had to start over like 3 times because the game would freeze.I am really disappointed, I had great memories from RCT3...

Early Access Review
								This is hugely dissapointing. Finally another edition to the iconic loved series comes along and this is bearing in mind i played the beta weekends and felt disappointed then, it hasn't got any better. GAMEPLAY - Load times are somewhat slow, i run on a i7-4790k, GTX 970, 16GB RAM and just loading a blank sandbox park takes me 42 seconds, yeah not the end of the world but loading a blank park.. Lots of framerate drops too for seemingly no reason. I see no difference in the gameplay mechanics, the grid facility is pointless as it doesn't match up with anything, they say they completely overhauled the coaster builder since the beta. Well again i see no difference in the coaster builder now compared to the beta, it's really not good, it's incredibly difficuilt to get any smooth turns/curves/corners. Alot of placements of objects, scenery, paths etc. aren't 'allowed' when there is nothing blocking them from being placed. It's just frustrating, it's all these features that are the most fundamental part of the game and they still just don't work. Everything is just very tedious and frustrating to do, it should be easy! But instead, i feel it's very very poor.GRAPHICS - I wouldn't even go as far to say that they are OK, i understand graphics aren't everything, however after Roller Coaster Tycoon 3's release date of October 26th 2004 the graphics feel like more of a remaster apposed to up to date graphics. It just feels lazy, and it simply doesn't look refreshing or exciting. Nothing new or high tech going on here. Framerate drops all over the place even on low settings, changing graphical settings hasn't seemed to help in any scenario.CONTENT - Unfair to say considering it is now in early access and more content will be released, but don't expect a lot to begin with. There is barely a campaign. There are specific 'scenarios' such as 'Turn a failed park around' which are ok but not exactly a lot of thought put in here either. A sandbox mode which is great to have still so thats a positive!! FEATURES - Really the only noteable new good feature, is the curved paths and having the ability to not be restricted by a grid (however as previously said, neither work as you'd expect) other than that, there isn't a lot of difference. The social hub is a good idea to be able to share creations but i haven't seen it working yet so i can't comment.OVERALL - Bringing the franchise back again sounds like a fantastic idea, and what the developers are telling us and raising our hopes for just hasn't happened. Everything feels lazy and sloppy, just as if there is no passion put in anymore. It's such a disappointment, if you are a Roller Coaster Tycoon fan i can't imagine you are going to feel anything but disappointment which i hate to say. Once again, it's early access so there are features yet to come so this is as of now, but considering it has been delayed and now shoved in early access. Things don't look good.			"

								I really wanted to like this game. I've been waiting all of my childhood for this game. The two things that ruins it for me is that to make a rollercoaster, the primary element of this game, you need to spend hours tweaking and fixing the coaster because for some reason, coasters enjoy crashing themselves. After 2 hours, I gave up. The second thing is that this game is poorly optimized, and even on low settings, I get around 30 FPS on my decent computer.tl;dr It kills me to say this, but don't play this game, even if it is tempting.

								THIS GAME DOESNT FEEL LIKE ROLLERCOASTER TYCOON AT ALL...It reminds me of when SimCity came out. (the new one) And everything was way to big for the map. Good luck fitting 3 coasters on the same map. No underground coaster can be made. The seperate lines in the rollercoaster line right before you get in. They should have people waiting there already to make it a faster process. Auto deleting trees and terrian would be nice.   I dont like the fact that you cant place food stalls without adding another path to them. I dont like how theres no stairs for steeper path declines. I would much rather just have the old block system with paths. Because when you start curving paths and such it turns into were Tropico and Simcity were so oldly setup. I like the idea of setting up curved paths but it never turns out right. Theres no room on the map for Maintence sheds and cleaning rooms. Get rid of them bring back the old style.I like picking up cleaning guys. And setting them where i want them. And so much more disapointment waiting for you.  I was really looking forward to this game. But now I have a huge sad face. It would of been better if they just added new rides to Rollercoaster tycoon 3 with wider paths.			"

								Ok, first off - I remember going to EB games as a kid to buy the very first Chris Sawyer RCT back in around 1997. I have always been a loyal and dedicated fan of the franchise. I have spent entire summers in earlier editions of this game. I love the idea of this game!~This roller coaster tycoon...... I started playing this way back after the beta test in february. Since then, nothing much has changed. The game isnt even fully functional yet. its missing a few things still like transport and water rides, etc.. But whats worse, is that there are fundamental elements don't even work properly. I keep on trying to play it and then some bug starts ruingin everything. Today for example, in mid game - TWICE, the ability to click on rides and interact with them in any way with the mouse just completely stopped. More then one train ona track doesnt even work, hasent ever worked. Pathways are still wonky and force connect to nodes which leave you with all sorts of weird awkward results. Its just a mess... one thing gets added, two more things break. The most recent bug makes the game unplayable. I was really looking forward to this game, but with each passing day I am loosing more and more hope that this thing is ever even going to make it to a playable level...			"

								I bought this game way back in September of 2015, i was looking forward to it's release for so long. Then when it was realeased i was so excited and i couldn't wait to play it and then i seen what a crappy job they did and i couldn't believe it. (Eg: The peeps look terrible and are very glitchy, they also don't follow the path ways properly, neither does the staff.  At points the staff and guests didn't walk but they just floated around the park, the rides are very choppy and some of them don't seem fun at all. I know it's not done yet but honestly how could they think that this was good enough to release? I have loved RCT eversince the first one came out. I played this for a few days and i finally got fed up enough to the point where i just stopped playing it. What a let down, after all of this time waiting just to end up getting a kick in the junk. I thought Atari would have more heart invested into the game than this but i guess i was wrong. They need to give our money back and start over from scratch. I don't think i'll be getting my money back at this point but it's ok, i'm willing to accept that.I had already bought the final copy of Coaster Planet but this game drove me to buying the early bird access for it. Coaster Planet is amazing and it's alot easier on my nerves than RCTW was.Coaster Planet isn't done yet but it looks a hell of a lot better than this and it's clear that they do give a♥♥♥♥♥♥and care about their customers.I guess the roomers were true, Atari was just in it for the money, thanks alot.You should all be ashamed of yourselves.Unless the game gets a hell of alot better, i won't be back.

Early Access Review
								Although this game is currently in 'early access' i'm not going to be too lenient on it as I originally pre-ordered it to come out in December 2015. For me, it has recreated the old 'Rollercoaster Tycoon' games but just removed the fun. Pros:- Despite what some people say, the rollercoaster builder is actually quite nice to use and I was able to create some good designs with it.- The ride cameras can sometimes be fun (if the framerate keeps up enough!)Cons (Where do I even start?):- Such a simple task of building paths is such a pain.. the game is so fussy about what connects where, and even with grid and snapping, I was unable to create a simple straight path system- The ride a building placement is equally as unpredictable, refusing to allow buildings to be placed in open areas next to paths, also not automatically joining to a path when placed directly next to one.- The staffing system has been 'dumbed down' and the janitors walk off and do what they want. You find yourself constantly building new staff buildings as the staff have seemingly disappeared and I cannot find a way to track them individually.- There is little to no customization on certain rides (especially pre-built ones).. Again, this removes a large portion of the fun.- The game seems to include food and souvineer stands from 4 set themes, limiting your creativity.- Only 3 maps that you can start from scratch on.- No autosave feature, so I lost over an hours work due to a power cut. In 2016 I would have thought this would be a standard feature?- Now for probably the biggest con.. graphics and performance... For a game that was supposedly meant to be 'retail ready' by December 2015, its appauling. The graphics look like a mobile phone game, or a PC game from 2004. Also the performance on highest settings is really bad. On my GTX 970, I can get around 30-40fps scrolling round my park. When I zoom in to watch the customers glitch around the footpaths and disappear into rides, however, i get as low as 15fps. The framerate is also very unpredictable when using the ride cams. I could go on and on about how I am disappointed by this game, but I'll cut the review here. I was looking forward to this so much last year that I didnt cancel my pre-order when I heard about the beta. I also eagerly downloaded it the minute I saw it was avaliable. I tried to enjoy the game and ignored the criticism, but all it did was make me want to play 'Rollercoaster Tycoon 2'! "

								I had high hopes for this game. I thought that people were exaggerating when they claimed that not too far into the game, there would be performance issues. Unfortunately, they were not lying. About one hour into a small park I was making, the lag began to hit. At first, it was because of the short periods of the day in the game switching from day to night. I then locked it in the day phase and it had helped at first. However, not too long after, the lag continued to worsen. I understand that the game is still being worked on so hopefully they work on improving the performance issues. I know it's not my computer because it affects other users as well. On to the next topic, one thing that ruins the experience is the lack of custom buildings, like the ones in the previous games. I really miss creating buildings for my ride queues and what not. My park seems baren and the lack of decor doesn't help. I wish we had a larger selection of roller coasters as well. It'd be nice to have water rides or dark rides but they're unavailable right now. I think they should work on adding more theming and improving the performance issues. At the moment, I would not reccomend this game but hopefully in the future my opinion will change.			"

								This game is severly broken. Avoid at all cost! I had hoped for something so much better. Go buy RCT3 if you want a much better game than this. Early access or not this is a sad farce. The only viable fix for this game is to scrap the whole thing and make a fresh start.  My 3 year old gaming rig runs every AAA title on the market just fine. This game looks like it should run on a 15 year old system but it has a massive memory leak and will bring my system to a crawl. Well here we are over 2 months since release and this game is still just terrible! Run Away! Do not buy this horrible turd.			"

												Essentially a polished RCT3. Realism has slid even futher. For people like me, a roller coaster enthusiast, I want to create roller coasters that look and sound like the real thing... these do not. The ""hyper"" coasters can have ridiculous inversions, the spinning coaster cars spin constantly for no reason, none of the sounds are authentic, the list goes on. Flat rides operate too fast. I get it, it's for show, but all I can think of when I watch them is that people's heads would be snapping off constantly. A good game for kids and early teens who don't care much about realism.			"

Early Access Review
								I am a life long RCT fan, a huge fan of the series. I have player RCT 1, 2 and 3. And I have been VERY EAGERLY looking forward to RCTW!! I pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition of the game to get the extra bits and pieces and to give some extra funds of support to Atari and Nvizzio. It was a very expensive price for a game but I thought it would be well worth it... I was wrong! Yesterday I got the game, RCTW installed and I launched it, and within the space of ten minutes I was totally deflated by what I saw... I work in software development. I have used BETA's to get feedback on software from BETA Testers. I have taken part in software BETA's and early access. And yes, the software is buggy and needs a bit of polish, but I am STUNNED that the state RCTW is currently in is what Atari and Nvizzio only recently classed as a nearly finished game that was getting some polish and optimisation. Are you serious!?! REALLY!!! I know RCTW has gone through some rough patches. It's passed through the hands of a number of developers and I have backed them all. I had real admiration for Nvizzio as I saw the work they were doing and it looked great!! But I can tell you now, the RCTW game I have on my PC right now doesn't look anything like what I saw in the videos and screenshots used to promote this game. I didn't get to play the BETA back in October as I was away, so seeing RCTW today is my first real introduction to it, but what I see in RCTW today looks worse than what I saw of the BETA. The graphics seems to have degraded completely! The peeps looks terrible!! There are animation glitches, gameplay glitches, sound glitches, and the game just doesn't grab a hold of you and make you feel good about playing it. There is no soul to the game at all. The whole atmosphere is just wrong, no, it's missing completely!! If this was BETA 2, I would have been stunned by the poor quality of it... If this was really early access I would have been stunned by the poor quality of it... But the fact that Atari have said, prior to the ""current"" early access release, that this game was nearly finished and it was just getting some polish and optimisation for release... WOW!! I can't believe that THIS is what Atari classify as being a polished 2016 PC game. So I have a question... What happened...?!? Seriously, what has happened here? How can this version of RCTW that is ""nearly finished and receiving some polish and optimisation"" look so poor, so bad, and is so buggy and holds very little fun, be considered as good enough for release as a game??? I have to be honest, I have ZERO faith in Atari and Nvizzio that they can bring this game up to a good enough standard to make it the game that it should be! I also am wondering just what have Atari and Nvizzio being doing the past few months when there was silence on the forums??? I was, at the time, hopeful that they were busy making the game great! But I certainly don't see it... I see a very poor game that is nowhere near ready for release and I find it insulting that they classed this as a nearly finished game, receiving some polish and optimisation to get it ready for release. For the record, I don't have access to the Planet Coaster ALPHA, I do have the game pre-ordered, but I can tell you now, their ALPHA looks a LOT better than the RCTW nearly ready for release game. I will keep watching to see what Atari and Nvizzio do to save RCTW but I'm not expecting a miracle to happen and that's what needs to happen. Let's be honest, if this is what they class as a game nearly finished and getting polished for release, then it's an utter shambles!			"

								I can't recommend this game at the moment. I was prepared for it to be different to the other RCT games but it's just no good.The staff huts don't seem to have proper pathfinding for the staff so I can have a large hut with 10 janitors and the paths are absolutely filthy. I've got about 40 janitors and mechanics in a reasonably small park but rides remain unfixed for absolutely ages and the paths are rammy. I've set the inspection times to 20 minute intervals, my rides still breakdown all the time and then remain unfixed for ages, even when right next to the mechanic hut.I can't see any way to easily see what staff I've got and where. I placed a large entertainers hut... 1 month later  (game time obvs!) I saw 2 entertainers leave the building. And there were 6 'employed' apparently but no sign of them months later.There's no way that I can see what excitement levels or intensity the rides I'm building have before I actually build them. I don't know whether I'm getting value for money or not as I used to use that information to determine how much I can charge for the ride etc. Also doesn't say how big the ride is going to be until you actually select it.I was playing the campaign on frolicking forest, deleting trees and shrubs was a frickin nightmare and levelling the ground left me with several rock outcrops that wouldn't flatten so it was a little bit pointless. You should be able to delete trees and bushes by dumping a ride on top of them and all land you own should be able to be flattened easily.I want to like this game but I don't right now. I know it's early access but it should be better than it is.			"

								Well for now i have given up on this monstrosity of a game. It is a insult to the Tycoon genre. Luckily i didn't pay full price for it (Phew!) I may come back to it in the future if they sort the paths and the peeps out. But for now I will go without my Roller Coaster genre fix. I have bought in to Planet Coaster. But just the standard pre-order for a lot less than this. Only have to go a couple of months without my fix. But going without is better than putting myself though the pain of playing this junk.			"

								Not reccommending yet anyway.... this game has promise, but at this stage that is all it is... i love the RCT series and played all of them on PC since the first and put many hours in.... The major thing for me at this stage is the coaster builder, you can do anything with it which is great, but the problem is you can do anything with it and it is so hard to build anything complex or overly quick without it going wrong... you cannot delete multiple pieces of track, you have to select each one, it is pretty much impossible to build one using the track building as per RCT3, this has taken a backwards step IMHO, the people in the game are idiots, they are complaining they are hungry outside a huge selection of food shops and still complain, there is sick everywhere and no janitors ever clean it up, you cannot scale, or amend prebuilt rides or flats, the drop tower should be much higher and you should be able to amend this to suit, no monorail or trains (Yet, hopefully they will come).... I guess the main question should be what has changed since RCT3..... not a huge amount really.. yes the GFX look a bit better and the menus are different but is it really 10 years newer???? I guess the answer is no and unless they sort the coaster builder out so it makes sense and you can do what you want to do then i guess its kind of a backwards step vs RCT and when that came out.... I hope the DEV's can bring this into the 21st century as i want this to be good, but its just a bit lacking in every department.... this is an early release so i am holding out hope but i was hoping and expecting so much more..... PS if anyone can tell me how to do a straight bit of track using the builder then im all ears!			"

Early Access Review
								This is in reference to the Early Access build released March 30.The good news first: The core engine is fairly solid, and is more than adequate to build a robust park-creation sim upon.The bad news is that they haven't done that yet. There's very little of the Early Access build that can be considered robust. The press release for the EA build boasts 4 different themes, and tons of scenery; the '4 different themes' bit is technically correct, but only because they didn't include the word 'complete.'  The 'tons of scenery' boast is an outright fib, unless they were estimating the raw, real-world tonnage of the simulated rock formations and generic foliage that comprise the mass of your 'theming' options. Actual theming options -- statuary, themed plants, facades, animatronics, landscape textures, etc. -- are extremely slim. As a strange contrast, there actually IS a fairly robust selection of fences and path textures, quite possibly more than were available in RCT3, so if you were hinging your plans for a dream park on pavement options, brother, this could be your train. A building sim lives and dies by its building options, and RCTW just doesn't have them, yet. It's hard to imagine what Atari was hoping to accomplish with this EA build; while this move ostensibly beats Frontier's ""Planet Coaster"" to the Steam marketplace, the lack of options can only result in unflattering comparisons and bad press.  I remain optimistic that the missing theming options are forthcoming (particularly if they have any hope of properly implementing dark rides, as they've announced), but as it stands right now, they have a long, long road ahead if they desire to catch up to RCT3, and much longer still if they hope to surpass it. For now, there's not enough here to justify a purchase. Will update review if this changes.			"

								To review the game I will just paste my comment on the discussion board, hopefully people will understand;""We have taken all the good from previous games and made it better"" - I don't think soFirst off before I begin I want to point out that this isn't a BAD game, but the videos the devs released gave it a bit too much hype.Now as the title suggests I am here to point out the stuff that was good from the old games but the devs seemed to think was not important.The ability to modify your staff's roles, assign them to specific paths and to customer their uniforms.Now come on guys, really? This was a key fuction (for me anyway) as a kid to keep my park at top spec, now I am unable to make sure litter and other things is kept off paths as the janitors decide they just don't need to go up a ramp.The ability to modify/customise pre-built coasters/rides.Again, really? What harm would it of caused allowing us to change the colours of thrill rides or stores? My early parks in previous games were all colour coded sections and themes, now I know I can sort of have a theme BUT who says I want my sci-fi section to be blue and blue only?The graphics are really dated.This is another thing I don't quite get, you have the potential to make an amazingly good looking game, yet it looks like RC3 a couple of years later. Then it also seems your optomisation for powerful machines is a bit lacking too, when I put details to very high, I expect more than just block colours.Custom built coasters need some work.You build a piece, then you click it to move it, then you add bits, the you tell it to build another piece, then you move it....you are over complicating something that has unlimited potential.Like I said, it's not a bad game...it's just not a good game at this stage, yes yes, I know it's in alpha but they have had plenty of time to polish it up more than this...

								If you're looking for the successor to the excellent RCT3, you're looking in the wrong place if you are considering RCTW.  RCT3 was created by Frontier Developments, and *published* by Atari.  RCTW is being delveloped by NVIZZIO (the 3rd developer hired by Atari for this project), and published by Atari.  The ONLY relationship between RCTW and RCT3 is that Atari has a license to the RCT name.  That's it.  This is Nvizzio's first stab at a RCT game, and it shows. Planet Coaster, however, is the true successor to RCT3, and is made by the same team, Frontier Developments.  It's simply doesn't have an RCT name because Atari paid Chris Sawyer for rights to the name.  Frontier has TONS of experience creating a great roller coaster park sim, since they did RCT3 and many other games in the theme park genre.  The attention to detail in Planet Coaster is amazing.  Just watch some YouTube videos and check it out yourself.  Frontier uses their own engine for Planet Coaster (PC), and it's obviously up to the task of making beautifully-rendered environments with thousands of animated guests that react to your park.So, I'm not going to repeat all of the negative reviews of RCTW here.  Those are all (mostly) true.  I've moved on, since Planet Coaster is far, far, far beyond where RCTW is.  If you want the ultimate in theme park simulation experiences, don't walk away from RCTW...

The graphics are horrible, the animations are cringe worthy and the sound effects are not good either.For a 2016 game, it simply by far doesn't cut it. Early Access or not.My advice: Don't waste your money on this mess, but invest in Planet Coaster instead, since that, even in Alpha, is already much better compared to this.			"

This game is not what I though it would be after several months. I have waited for it to get better and I have lost all trust in the developer and Atari. They need to realize that producing half done games and titling them as ""Early Access"" is absolute nonsense. These quick push games are just cash grabs. The only company that has proven itself is Frontier with Planet Coaster (which is the only game I have played since it came to Steam).  I simply do not play this game anymore.			"

Early Access Review
								So after playing for a couple hours, id thought I would share some of the things I like and do not like.So first off my major gripe is the AI, or lack of it. Workers hardly ever clean no matter how many janitor stalls you build, You have a park full of sick and trash. And people who seem to be ill, that look like Zombies.The visitors just seem to flock to the newest ride, there is no real equilibrium. The Animations and overall quality of the visitors is super poor, if you zoom in its tolerable, although nothing like the quality of Planet coaster, think more ""Theme park animation / graphic quality"" What is with the visitors animations? if you zoom in they seem to walk fine, but if you zoom out to the normal distance its as if the FPS drops on just the visitors animations. Looks ugly, seeing the ""peeps"" lagging. While the rest of the rides animations are fine.I dont like the themed buildings, it seems half arsed and an after thought. The shops look bad as they are, but you have to have 20 of the same ugly buildings because the ""peeps"" have a preference of which ugly building they buy from.The sounds OMG the Sound design is terrible. Tinny sounding music, constant screaming of children. I had to play on mute. The times I have been to parks, I dont hear screams over the ambient noise, like its the ""Hostel"" film.They clearly have got allot of inspiration from City Skylines ie the path placement, the style of UI, the land system. But have not translated all the quality and charm Skylines has.The game just seems to lack depth, I want a research tree. To have goals to unlock the rides / shops i want.I want better Animations on everything but the rides, I want better quality graphics, I want scenery that matches it surroundings so rock formations and things dont look so artificial. I want a more in-depth staff system, that I control. But after 5 hours of play the thing that is bugging me so much that I have to stop is the buggy visitor animations / AI / quality.I dont feel like spending hours building something awesome, to watch these freaks walk around my sick/trash/zombie filled park.I like the Coaster system, I like the variety or scenery. I like the terrain tools, I like the pathing system and the UI although it lacks depth.You say you went the EA route not to add polish but to add more ""functionality"" The game needs WAY MORE polish. This does not look like a game released in 2016.The core is there and some of the systems are in place although they lack allot of depth. I pre-ordered so long ago, I really wish you had not of released it in this state, even as EA.You only get 1 real launch and first impressions mean everything. Im unsure whether to refund this or not.I im such a fan of this series even after pre-ordering so long ago and let down after let down. Everything I stated is meant for constructive purposes, not as hate or any other BS. I hope this helps.This is for the developers, not a PR person you delete my post and ill post it somewhere you cant delete it			"

I may review this decision in 12 months time but of course Planet Coaster should be released then so I might not even need to bother with this game.Oh and what sort of Wooden Roller Coaster doesn't have guard rails running along each side of the track...I mean, come on guys...And where's the corkscrew coaster!?

Early Access Review
								This Game does not live up to its promise. They pushed it back and back since they cannot meet the deadlines apparently. Then they have applied the smart marketing trick of making it early access: meaning no money left but they desperately need it. Which would be ok I guess BUT:There is the tiny problem of an important feature missing: stacking scenery to build buildings etc. Their response: I could go into a 3D software and create my own models of scenery but in game I cannot because it would be too complicated. So a major NO! Rides cannot be customised at all (except for colors and a couple of trees) and thus it feels like a smartphone game rather than a real RollerCoaster Tycoon (even when just considering the graphics). Maybe they will activate that feature in an in app purchase way or add high resolution textures as a DLC. But they stated that they will add rides and scenery and tweek the physics, but that the basics of the mechanics are pretty much done.If you are ok with all of these limitations, I can recommend you the game because it does exactly what you expect. If you don't, then keep far, far away from this game!Finally, on a personal side, due to this ""clever"" marketing trick and these false promises, I am no longer elegible for a refund of the game: I preordered 2 months before the official release date, the game came out 4 months after the official release date as an early access and I requested a refund with 5 minutes of ingame play - steam says sorry, you have purchased it more than 6 months ago - WHAT? So another thumbs down but this time for steam. I will still try to get a refund though!			"

								Worst RCT ever and completely unworthy of the name. They should have given the new RCT to Frontier. Now over at Frontier they have made a better and cheaper game than RCT World, which is a complete failure in every aspect from the terrible music, cheap aestethics, uncreative building possibilities and terrible performance/bugs.The game is still in Early Access, but Planet Coaster is infinitely better at everything in its alpha, so my hopes lie elsewhere.I also have to notice that the game destroyed my OBS profile and then refused to load after reinstalling three times. Apparently their plan is to make me sit in front of a loading screen at 0% until I reach the mark of 2hrs playtime after which I can't get my refund.			"

								as a long term rct fan this game is by far A JOKE!!!  yeah sure early access but update after update fixed NOTHING the tracks go under the ground when i wanna do a hammer head turn, when i finish the coaster its ultra extreme no matter what the coaster is. then coaster editor is way too complicated to use (i got somewhat used to it but still) it should be like rct 2 style when building.  i know theyre trying to innovate but there should be a style option for building in the editor. so all in all the game is WAY TOO BUGGY!!!! hell it shouldnt even been released in early access.  This early access is a joke and im personally ashamed of it being a rct game forgive me and all but this game is not worth my time! avoid this game like the plague!  RCT 2 and 3 are by far superior than this garbage!!!			"

								I know this is an early release version of the game - but honestly, it is even light years behind the previous instalment in the series, RCT3, in terms of graphics and game physics. In terms of usability, it is far too complex in places that could be a lot more simple, too, and for a game that I've wanted since I was about fifteen, this has really let me down. If this was £10, then I would say it was worth the expenditure. But this much money? I definitely would not recommend it. I have honestly never felt this let down by a video game in the past, and I can see a lot of people jumping to this game's direct rival - coaster planet - Upon its release. This is the kind of quality that I would expect from a tablet game. I'll check back in the future and see if RCT can revive my faith in the series, but as of now, it's looking extremely unlikely. Farewell, RCT, and farewell my hard earned £30. You will be missed!			"

								I have been a big fan of the RCT series, but RCT world is bad. The physics are broken, creating a coaster is hard, and the graphics are mediocre. But hey! It’s all okay, because the game is in  EARLY ACCESS!  It’s really sad that many devs and publishers (other than Atari) are using early access as an excuse and a crutch for lazy programming and getting your money faster. I miss the days where you would get a game and it was complete. No DLC, no early access, just buy the game and play.			"

								03/09/16for the first time since this games been available on steam ive sat and actually enjoyed playing this game and yes there are still many issues with the game but the developers atleast seem to care,The new PxP building method is a great starting point and i hope they continue to build on it, yes it was a bit janky to begin with and i did get frustrated with it but after a few hours im making good looking scenery thats really fleshing out the park.for those who already own it give it a try it cirtainly surprised mefor those who dont own it wait...26/1/17after unity 5.4 update - when it runs, it's running smoother than last time i played it but its still such a mess, having tried itme and time again to build somthing in this game it just relentlessly gives me the finger and crashes.Its a shame with each time i try this after a big gap in updates it seems to improve and if they worked a miracle and made it so it plays on lower spec pc's it might have its own niche specially since planet coaster requires a good pc to run.but once again skip it, it really is as bad as you've heard			"

								From what I have experienced with this game so far, I must say that it is a step in the wrong direction from Roller Coaster Tycoon 3. The coaster builder is tough to control, the path building system is pretty limited, and the graphics are not very good for a game that is released in 2016. On top of this, I have tried searching for the past hour and a half on both Steam and Atari's website for instructions on how I would be able to return and recieve a refund for this game but no success (even though it was mentioned on the latest blog post that I could recieve one until March 31, which is today).

Early Access Review
								I tried to stay positive, even though this game has had its fair share of negativity in the, ehh, recent past. I remained hopeful for the EA, and this review is keeping in mind that it's EA. Having played a few EA titles, and knowing how much a title can improve to final release, this review is negative, because I just don't see that it will improve enough to final release to warrant a positive review. Yes, it will improve, but I just dont see that without starting from scrath (again), this game can be salvaged. In any case, keep in mind that this review is of the first EA release.But let me start with the positive. For me, at least, it runs smoothly and without problems. Performace wise, then, it's good. That is about all the positive I can say about it. Other than that, nothing positive to report, unfortunately.The graphics are, without question, horrible. Nothing close to the ""in game"" screens we were shown before. The rides, the scenery, foliage, ground textures etc... I haven't seen any redeeming quality to any of it. There are several things I compare this to: RCT3, Planet Coaster (the competitor), Cities Skylines (built on the same engine), other similar sim-type games from the past 10 years. Without fail, I cannot think of any other high-profile game that is worse than the current state of RCTW.Animations of rides are adequate I guess, but nothing to write home about. They could do with better physics simulations.Animations of peeps - how they move that is - is atrocious. Even RCT3 did a better job at this. They perform several actions and show their emotions (e.g. having to go to the bathroom, hunger, anger, being sick etc.), but the animations are honestly just bad. Even their standard walking and running actions are awkward. On that note, peeps look horrible. Colours, textures, shapes, everything. If you're into misformed yellow and brown blobs with creepy unexpressive and oversized eyes, this may be your thing. But no, they are not ""cartoony"", they just look like they stepped out of a game from the mid-90s. What I may forgive the EA for is peeps, park workers (cleaners, medics etc.) walking through fences, buildings, off-grid paths, each other, to their destination. I may also forgive cleaners sweeping footpaths about 6 feet  away from where the dirt actually is. These can be fixed in future updates. But what will be a tall order to do is the seemingly faulty pathfinding of peeps to their destinations, which at this stage seems worse than in RCT3. The workers also seem to have a wonky work/pathfinding method to get to their next destination. For examply, just in RCT3, janitors are happy to walk straight past 10 puke piles to get to a dropped cup half-way across the park. These kinds of AI behaviours I am less optimistic can be fixed easily. Paths are very hard to use. The three widths are ok, but their snap points are hard to use. This is a similar problem that Planet Coaster suffers from currently, that foodcourts with tighly packed shops are basically impossible to build. Maybe something that will be resolved. This is personal preference, but should be inclued in the review: I am no fan of the pre-made and themed large food stalls and buildings. I much prefer a smaller footprint basic stall and build my own scenery/building around it. For me, at least, Planet Coaster has an advantage here. This is personal preference, if you like plop and forget, then RCTW is for you - just not for me at this time. The coaster builder is actually not that hard to use. If I compare it to Planet Coaster's, I would say it's about the same level of difficulty to use. From me, no major complaints with the basic construction side of things. On the other hand, the graphics of coasters, their supports and the physics seem wonky to put it mildly. Much work needed here, but I think it could be done. Overall mechanics and park management is basically a carbon copy of RCT3. Yes, the heat map and extra graphs may give you a bit more information about the park, and in the future there may be a few extra options in buildings, but overall it is exactly the same and nothing new to see. I also don't see any ""placeholders"" for future expansions in this realm to get me excited. TLDR - in conclusion: very unpolished, which may be expected for EA. I personally don't see, however, how it'll be the game that was promised to the community - feels like at this point no matter how much the turd is polished, it remains a turd. Maybe there was too much hype from Atari (understandable marketing) making my expetations too high, but compared to my own expectations, this game falls short. If you have tons of $$ to buy both PC and RCTW, do so. It may be a fun game for a little while and worth the investment down the line. If you only have $$ for one, I'd recommend waiting and spending it on PC, because I don't think this one will be PC's match even at final release. I have both, and will keep both. But I am a sucker, and wouldn't recommend it to others. I wanted to add a little edit to the end of this review to maybe clarify one point. This review may have been positive, but it is - and I fully acknowledge this - skewed by expectations. This is not my own preconceptions about what I expected the ""next-gen"" RollerCoaster game to be like, but rather by the expectations I had based on the promises made by Atari reps this past year or so. While Planet Coaster does look much better than RCTW right now, at least graphically, in terms of features it offers much, much less. But - and this is a big but - they folks at Frontier have been very honest with where the game is currently, what they are releasing in the Alpha and why, what they want to test and what kind of feedback they want. On the other hand, the folks at Atari have been spewing AAA, the best, so exciting, full of features, looks awesome, and other such language, which this game is not. At least not currently. So yes, a large part of the negative review is part of the humongous PR failure on Atari's part. If they had kept expectations realistic (not low, but realistic) and were honest what is actually being released - an unpolished pre-alpha stage of the game, I may have had a positive review. But not like this. If I take their word that this game has been in ""final optimization and polishing"" for the past four months, and is 90% complete, then no, I cannot give it a positive rating. Just wanted to clarify this point. :)			"

								Has potential but needs a lot of polish!First and foremost - fix the camera when building a coaster.  Give us an option for the camera NOT to follow the track additions.  Every time I chnage a track peice, size, lenght, etc. the camera moves me farther away (usually up) which makes finishing a coaster very frustrating.  I've managed to play for about 3 hours and in my last session finally copmpleted a custom coaster - several times before I gave up & quit the game.Second, keep fixing bugs.  Once I finally completed my first custom coaster the trains crashed off the track in a straight spot of track.  No reason for the coaster to fail????  I quit the game after that...Third and final rant for now - we need an option to sync same selected option across stalls.  This was added to previous versions of RCT because it just makes sense.  Its no fun clicking on each & every stall to chnage a setting (turn music on) or adjust a price.I understand this is ""Early Access"" and it is a shame that this is used as a tool to ship incomplete product to the consumer.  Early Access was certainly not mentioned when I pre-ordered.  Wish I could recomend but not in it's current state.			"

								It scratches an itch for $20. I would not recommend paying $50 for something that has had the troubled development cycle this game has had. the game crashes, lags when the park is near capacity, the peeps are downright stupid and sometimes don't even stay on the paths correctly. The graphics are not great, including the scenery which looks particularly bad when trying to design something nice to look at. This would all be forgivable considering it's ""early access"", however they may not be trustworthy to fully fix the issues. They've swapped developers twice, have delayed a year and at the last second decides it's early access and then wants $50 from you. If you can find a sale for $20, it's got more than enough content here, buggy and all to justify that price point. Not everything is horrible and I had fun building my scifi park. It's just not worth $50 for something that's possibly not a sure thing. Planet Coaster looks really great too, however $75 for early access is outrageous.			"

I purchased this game expecting it to be the next generation in rollercoaster gaming due to spending hours and hours playing Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, however Rollercoaster Tycoon World is far more restrictive taking the element of creation away from the gamer causing the fun to be sucked out of the game.This game has received nothing but bad reviews and feedback, i purchased this game when it was in early access with promises that it would get better, unfortunately this has not been the case.  With the bad reviews and feedback from this product I feel Steam should be offering customers the option of a refund or at least credit to have the opportunity to purchase another game. When contacting steam on this I was refused. Do not buy this game, you will be disappointed.			"

I'm sure RCTW will pick up the slack ""eventually"" and be a good game but as it is and how LONG it's actually been in development but not counting on how many times the game has gone to new code and old code wiped out... I mean... just look at the videos it looks amazing, but the actual game is the real definition of♥♥♥♥♥♥!!

								RollerCoaster Tycoon World has several problems in its current state:- The Grid and Snap on function doesn't always seem to work as intended. Making two roads parallel to eachother is far more difficult than it should be.- Making rollercoasters the way you want is nearly impossible. I can't even make a simple loop.- Coasters can't be tested while the time is paused.- The building/editing tool for both roads and coasters takes time to get used to. - To edit terrain doesn't work correctly, and can make permanent holes in the ground. - Peeps (AI people) seems to have problems with pathfinding at times. - The few tutorials they do have are useless.Despite these problems I did have some fun with the game, however the older games have so far been better. I hope they fix the problems as well as improve the controles for building/editing tools. At its current state I cannot recommend the game.			"

								This game shouldn't have been an ""early access"".  I'm tired of these half finished games especially from an old franchise like RCT.  There's so many missing features in RCTW that RCT3 had, like being able to test your coaster while building it (Maybe its there, but I've yet to find it.  It shouldn't be so hard to find a simple option).  I must add with the roller coster builder is beyond frustrating to use.  For some reason you're not able to add a chain lift peices untill you're done with the coaster.  My next point is Graphics.   I run a GTX 970, 8GB Ram, and Phenom II x4 processor,  I shouldn't have to put everything on medium just to not get choppy graphics.  I hope they end up fixing this pile of garbage soon or I'll be stuck playing RCT1,2,3 for the rest of my life (which actually wouldn't be so bad)			"

								As someone who has been defending RCT with how slow they have been releasing this game, I am compeltely disappointed in the Early Access. First of all the tutorial is a FAQ of text. Altering the terrain really tests your patience with such a tiny brush size and no strength option. You cannot flatten terrain with trees and bushes, however to delete them you have to click on every single bush and tree (which the majority of the time the cursor doesn't sync to what you're trying to delete) - there is no drag a box to delete or brush tool deletion. There is also no undo button, which is extremely handy in building sim games. Laying pavements are frustrating when there is no freetool option and the grid tool is buggy. Camera controls are very limited to WASD to move the camera and scroll wheel adjusts zoom and angle. Basically, TLDR: Worst than previous RCT (buy RCT3) and it's a terrible Early Access Game, save your money until proper release and see what everyone says about improvement/ save for Planet Coaster which looks epic.

								Got banned for making critical comments about the 2 years they had my money and didn't deliver the game.  I had pre-purchased the game 2 years ago and the developer kept giving false release dates...and then finally released it as a ""early access"" a day or two ago.  They banned me because I was critical of their false advertising and false reporting of release date.  And just before they banned me...they kept deleting all my posts that were about game ideas and comments about game progression.  SO...whatever discussions you are reading....have mostly all been santized already. They are not letting any critical posts or anything that might even be a suggestion to help the game get better.  All they want to do is let the discussions appear as if the game is completely fine.  All suggestion discussions are being deleted to give a false impression of game.    As a side note, to move around the map you need to use your keyboard.  It's not like RCT3 or any other game like this....when you move the mouse to the side of the screen, you should be able to move around the map w/o using a keyboard.  Very frustrating.  When they unban me...i MIGHT change my negative review.			"

The first hour or 2 it seemed a little interesting, but after that it was nothing but glitches galore. This is a step down from RCT3. I know its early access but i hardly see them improving this enough to be worth playing. This game should be $20 most if that. I reccomend you wait for Planet Coaster, even though its not being released till the end of this year.			"

								This game is Amazing!ly bad. Go get Planet Coaster since its made by Frontier Developments who made RCT3. Planet Coaster plays just like RCT3. Full control of the game with the mouse and has every good feature of RCTW and RCT3. RCTW requires using the keyboard for 99% of the game while Planet Coaster can be 99% without a keyboard. If you still live in the time before the mouse existed this game is for you. If you wait until it comes out on disc you can buy an expensive coaster to hold your drink while playing Planet Coaster. The only downsides are Planet Coaster is not on Steam and does not yet have coaster building. When I played this it felt like a crime scene knowing RollerCoaster Tycoon World had been murdered. I dont know when, but I have seen the body so I know it happened.			"

								lets see here where do i begin.oh yea half the content as rct 3.NO transport rides,NO custom buildings,i cant even tell you how many less rides.It really is unbelievible.i only played for a couple of hours and thats all i needed being a owner of rct3 platinum.the land footprint in sandbox mode is tiny compared to rct3.It really is diapointing how devopers are really just putting out subpar programs nowadays.I think one reason is trying to widen customer base that can play without a so called super computer.Which for people with high end systems only leaves us frustrated.Not being a computer tech even though i built my own PC tri screen 2-980Ti,i7 kind of stuff when you have better graphics in order to accomidate others you have to lesson the content.Oh and the one thing i truly hate is that i have to use the arrow keys to move forward and backward plus side to side no more moving the curser to the edge of the screen total bummer.

								So. I was really disappointed by this game and got myself a refund. I normally don't do that but the overall approach, not to communicate in any way with the users here before the release should've warned me but I wanted it to be good.But I played for some hours yesterday.There are some fun points and good approaches but the overall content was really disappointing.Aside from coaster construction the gameplay is behind RCT3.The staff management is horrible and I don't really understand why I have a grid, when I can't really use it.The tutorial was ok but still.... The ride artwork is ok but the rides in the beginning are just WAY TOO BIG...and the performance overall for this .. meh. I got >100 games on steam and this is my first refund ever... That basically says it.And I do not let the ""Early Access"" thing count. This game has been delayed and delayed ... There was plenty of time. If that's just to justify minor bugs ok....But this is pre alpha at best....			"

												As a huge fan of the RCT games, RCT World was disappointing. It doesn't feel like a game worthy of the series. It's kind of bland, dull, non-compelling. Playing in early access, I kept hoping they'd polish it up and make it fun to play. And that never happened. It's just not...fun.			"

Early Access Review
								I feel like this early access release was a valiant effort on Atari's part to fix all the problems that were definitely evident in the first beta. However as I have come to play this early access now, some of the problems within the coaster design and potential layout of an entire theme park have almost become worse. In the first beta of this game I knew the coaster builder needed quite a bit of work done, I did slowly start to get used to parts of it while I was building and managed to get a few functioning coasters going in my park. This new release of the coaster builder places a very opaque sphere where your cursor is to build the next piece, but it is very hard to adjust and manover the placements. It also becomes very jumpy when trying to edit previously added parts to the coaster. Also there is no way to turn it off if you just want to go by segments which I felt was a good addition they said they were going to add in. I would be much happier if I had a button to manually jump between the two, ironically it would make building a coaster much more seamless. The other big issue I have is that we no longer have the options to place entrances and exits, I'm not sure if this will be adjusted before release but it removes a degree of customization out of theme park building which we have always had in the RCT series. I also find the pathing system a little too jumpy. Even the old RCT 1 and RCT 2 pathing was better. The benefit to the game that I find is finally the implementation of buildings for mechanics and janitors, instead of just dropping them in the game like the old days. It will be interesting to see how much they need to radically change when they exit out of this early access program. I may pop on occasionally over the next little while to see if they take in anymore of what the community is describing as flaws to the game. And if they are successful, I could definitely see myself spending a good amount of time on this game much like my oodles of time spent on the previous games and change this review to a positive.I guess time will tell.

A terrible ride...After giving this game many chances, after defending the game after its terrible beta, after waiting for months... I think I can safely say that this game is nothing like a RCT game!I have been a fan of the RCT series since I was 8 years old, I loved it! I remember owning almost every edition of the game, I even had to rebuy RCT 3 as a kid cause I broke it by playing it so much!... But this... Oh man, this is a terrible retake on the series! It does not even feel like an RCT game, it's that bad! While I believe that there are people that enjoy this game (like 1/4th of the people do), it should've never been launched with the name RollerCoaster Tycoon! I respect the developers for keeping their heads up and keep pushing out updates, really I do appreciate the hard work from Nvizzio Creations... But they are in a bad spot! While I believe that Nvizzio Creations is a great company it is ruined by Atari's greedy mindset. You can push out a few more updates, but please... Trust me on this, it will never get out of early access, and if it does... The game wil be completely dead. *Update (17/11/2016): it got out of early access... But it's still terrible...*If you really want to get a copy of this game, get it when it's only 10 euro/dollar. It is not worth a full charge of €45,99 *Update (17/11/2016): It's €31,99 now, still not worth it...* It's ridiculous!* What's Good:- Consitent updates...- It's hard to find something good...* What's Bad:- Engine choice (Unity, really?)...- Paths are terrible...- Physics...- Everything you can imagine actually...

								RCTW Is a  coaster building game from the creators of RCT1 and RCT2... During my playthrough I quickly set up my rides and pathways, even tried out the coaster builder a few times... However we're going to narrow this review down to the good the bad and the ugly parts of the gameTHE GOOD- Killing Peeps on rides and drowning them is back! And more fun than before!- SOYLENT GREEN shop oh my ♥♥♥♥ing god if you're a sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like myself you'll include this in your park... It's kinda mandatory.- The graphics aren't bad, they are close to being on par with Sim City and Cities Skylines, but they're nothing special.- The sound is great! Hearing the bustleing of peeps and chains pulling coasters over a steep fall, it feels good and sounds appropriate.- Modding is there for those who can mod and whatnot and steam workshop will provide adiquate mods for people to try out.THE BAD- Coaster Builder will often Crash your game and your computer! Throught my multiple attempts to use it my monitors will often cut out when the game crashes, causing me to restart constantly. This issue MUST be fixed immidiatly -Some peeps are just UGLY and the shopkeepers are absolutely terrifying ""THEY STARE INTO THE DARKEST DEPTS OF YOUR SOUUUUUUUUL!!!!:-On occasion the framerate will dip and bog down the pc.THE UGLY-Lack of customization. You cannot customize the rides the same way you could in previous rct games, you can't make your own ride entrences and exits, instead there are preset buildings that you can plop down... I absolutely despise this-Coaster Builder is VERY tough to use at times, as you can try to make turns and lifts and dips, your mouse curser may spaz out and cause the track to expand into the♥♥♥♥♥end of nowhere...-Severe Lack of themes for your park... With previous titles you had wester, spooky,industrial, fun themes, ice themes, lava themes, dino, retro, suburbon, in this game there's hardly even a third of what previous games had in terms of themes... I thought this was a Theme park! (I can't even make a bad joke by locking sections of the park off to peeps unless they cough up money, so no paywall joke/ dlc joke for me"")FINAL THOUGHTSWhile the game can get addicting, and can be quite fun when it works, the glareing issues this game has is unbearable, even for an early acess game... I thought they delayed the game so that they can fix the issues, instead I see some the same issues I saw in the Beta!I guess I'll wait till planet coaster comes out and see how it fares.			"

Everyone's open to their own opinion but this is mine...THIS IS EARLY ACCESS, BUT MY FRUSTRATION IS ALSO EARLY ACCESS!!i apologise in advance to any diehard fans or anyone that's affected by what i write but this is simply as how i see it..Do I Recommend This Game? Depends... I'd only recommend this game once it has exited EARLY ACCESS, in the meantime save your money for other games or you could have a 1st hand test of the game and then quickly refund it if you're not confident or just youtube the game to see what's going on... A little research to the things you want in life doesn't hurt a bit..Been a fan of RCT for ages, yet this is by far the most dissapointing money wasting game i've paid for!!Having played for that amount of hours is more than enough for me to regret buying this, (played the game for 30min - 1 hr on alternate months only to see new things added but the old things ignored, eg; glitches, bugs, lags, crash, stupid A.I that doesn't even conform to what their supposed to do...I've reported, requested and questioned as to why certain things are the way it is and yes, if i do know how to do what they do, i'd help them, sadly, im a buyer and a gamer as almost everyone else who bought this game lookin to have a little enjoyment and a COMPLETE GAME and not expect a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥job but like i said earlier it's still in EARLY ACCESS!! Thinking it'd be fun like the previous RCTs, i gave it a blind chance by buying it before it's supposed launch of DEC 2015 but it got delayed, so MAR 31 2016 was when i managed to play glitchy buggy laggy game..  a month shy of a year from it's supposed launch, it still has many glitches and bugs and some other faecessss, and to this day it still looks the same... gave it a few chances and possibly waiting for it to end the EARLY ACCESS ERA!! and Yeaaahhh, I am about to F*CKING give up on this game and look on to PLANET COASTER as it looks promising, Keeping an eye on that while this shall be my lightest data paper weight ever in the meantime......My paper still flew....

I READ ALL THE BAD REVIEWS ON THIS AND DECIDED TO IGNORE THEM ALL AND TRY FOR MYSELF, THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS WERE RIGHT. I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THESE GAME COMPANIES THINK THEY CAN REVAMP AN OLD GAME AND CHANGE EVERYTHING... PEOPLE WANT THE OLD GAME THEY USED TO KNOW BUT WITH NEW DESIGNS, NOT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAME THEYVE NEVER PLAYED BEOFRE. HOWEVER WHILE IM BASHING, REGRETFULLY I HAVE TO SAY THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT, IF YOUR COMPONENTS CAN HANDLE IT.			"

								Remember how the earlier RCT games motivated you to really go out of your way to create an amazing theme park even if just making basic things that don't make any structural sense work just as fine? I don't get that feeling of excitement from this game; playing it feels like a chore.I really couldn't beleive the game was as terrible as the reviews make it out to be, but it really is boring and uninspired.The new coaster builder is very sloppy and confusing, the menus are unintuitive the tutorial is way too long and doesn't even properly explain you where everything is, and the new rating system is broken; why change something that worked perfectly in 3 previous games?!Sorry for my ranting, but this game is not good. I might give it another shot once the full game releases but as of now, I'm not touching this early access ever again. "

								I have played the game for several days  I just bought it last weekend, and I am sorry I dug into my wallet to purchase this game. It freezes up right in the middle of the game for no reason. Then when i try to reload my game I recieve an error message that simply states. ""Roller Coaster tychoon world.exe is not responding. If you close the program you might lose information.     Like that hasn't already happened. Why the developers put the games out for trial runs when none of the bugs have been worked out. It sucks. I have started four new parks and lost each and every one of them. So I give it a double thumbs down			"

								Sometimes developers are trying too hard to improve a game, and it ends up not good at all. Still early acces tho, so I can only hope it'll change. I was super hyped for the new RCT cause I loved the previous ones, but for now I'm really dissapointed. I started a game and quit like half an hour later. It gets boring really fast for now. I could spend hours and hours in RCT 1,2. But this one just doesn't feel like it. As i said it's only early acces right now, so looking forward to it's improvement :)But right now I can't really reccomend this.			"

								I wrote a review earlier, on the 4th in april to be precise, I reviewed the game as positive back then and I said it needed more content. I'm disappointed to see that they don't have updates which contains lots of new content, actually no new content at all. The coaster types are actually all the same, you have minimal amount of rides and I'm starting to regret my purchase. Just don't buy this game and wait until it has more content... LOTS MORE NEW CONTENT!!! It has been released now for a while and no big updates, only updates which screwed up my coasters.3/10   NEEDS MUCH MORE NEW CONTENT!!!			"

								I called it, RCTW = Sim City 2013. This game has poor performance (R9 390/i7 4790k), poor textures, poor animations,small map, not much rides, bad path building, broken janitors, puking peeps everywhere, bad day & night cycle, and ingame date & time speed ( a rollercoaster will do 1 or 2 runs within a month). And the thing that♥♥♥♥♥♥me off the most is that they was origanlly planning to release this trash in December. In what state would the game be in back then, yet we are still going to have fanboys and white knights defend this gaame to the death. And honestly even if they do fix these problems before the full release, I wouldn't expect much, seems to me this game is broken to the core and just needs to be scraped and start over.			"

								Currently, RCTW will run at a *measured* average of 19fps at 1024x768 / lowest settings.  That's on my Core i7 / Nvidia GT 940 laptop.  At 4K on lowest settings I get around 2fps.  I haven't tried the game on my desktop yet, but it's really not worth my bandwidth at the current state.  Fully maxed at 4K, I'm not really impressed at the looks of the game - it reminds of me of RCT3.  Gameplay wise, there's no in-depth park management, building straight paths is a nightmare (even with the grid on), and tbh there's just no fun in building a beautiful park like in RCT 1/2.  The charm is gone and replaced with flashy menus and thrill ride designs.			"

								This is really sad for me. I've been a RCT fan since the first one, and I was overly excited to RCTW as the start when Atari announced back in 2014. Just bought it in November, I was upset with the launch delay, but ok, I understood.But now, this EA (which is not an beta or alpha) looks really bad. I gotta say, not everything, but here are certain things that really dissapointed me, and I hope that Nvizzio will fix. Some of them was in the previous RCT games.- Everything is just too much big. (Even the food store, which I think is the smallest thing in the game)- The path tool didn't work to attach some things (some ridiculous things, it's hard to attach the queue lines in those)- You have NO CONTROL of the employees, and it's unnecessary to need a giant building to hire them. (You can't even set a specific place for them to stay)- There's no research for the things just like was before. You can unlock the things only completing the goals. I didn't like it.- You have very poor information and control of the guests (You can't ammount them by sorting the thinking or the feeling.- A simple roller coaster (yeah, really small and smooth track) it's getting a extreme-high level of Nausea, making about 80% of the people throwing their stomachs out by the exit of the track, making the paths incredible dirty.I will not talk about the graphics, the lagging, the low frame rate, and the visual of the peeps, which you can find more complains here in another review.It's playable. But it's kinda sad, really is. And don't worth the paying right now.I hope they'll fix all of this soon, making me change this review. I really hope.6/10			"

												The game itself is very confusing compared to previous installments (1-3...all of which had a more autocad like feel). They had a steep learning curve, but made easy with ten times the automatic coaster piece options. Once a person got the hang of it, the world was their oyster. On WORLD however, every button, control and feature is all jacked up. Maybe they lost certain rights to use the previous interfaces, button configurations and script interface methods so they had to change it to a foreign design. The game industry is doing that a lot. Some games claim to be ""different than Call of Duty"" but really they just switched the grenade and jump buttons and confused a bunch of noobies. Another thing is the 2014 release date...woops. Fast forward to the 2016 version that is for some reason sitting on shelves at Best Buy and Walmart with (full game must be downloaded from Steam) written on it...SO WHY THE DISK?! It is almost like we are loving shooting ourselves in the foot with this game. I want a refund and continued access to this game for free. Complete waste of money.			"

Please redesign it.Rollercoaster Tycoon World 7/10Simple and beautiful flat designed UI, with cool animation, easy to get started, but there are some translation errors and menu selection bugs at the current stage, which should be fixed after I believe.2 Game Elements2.1 RidesPlanet Coaster 8/10Rides totally functioned and animated beautifully, guests can interact with the rides perfectly, coaster can be easily built and mounted.Rollercoaster Tycoon World 7/10Rides totally functioned and animated beautifully, guests can interact with the rides but due to the awful guest model, it's ugly, coaster can be easily built and mounted.2.2 GuestsPlanet Coaster 9/10Perfect cartoon guest art style, featured tons of differnet animation which makes the park alive and artistic, but guest types are too narrow, too repeated.Rollercoaster Tycoon World 0/10Totally piece of sh1+, dumbass motherfcker super b1+ch puzzy cun+. What the FK is this? Guest? Peep? I'd better watch Justin Bieber dancing rather than watching those lame cheap craps walking and running.

And many themes available.Rollercoaster Tycoon World 5/10Acceptable but still needs to be polished, the cars parked outside are repeated and meaning nothing, and there are only 2 types of themes (meadowland and western). Vista is super ugly,2.4 PathPlanet Coaster 3/10Very bad path algorithm. I can not build stright paths and build linear stations, too bad, please redesign your algorithm for path system.Rollercoaster Tycoon World 6/10Path system is OK. I can build stright and bend paths as I want but still a little bit harder. And another very bad thing is the path seems to be floating on the land surface instead of stay right on the land surface, which makes the game looks cheaper.3 ExtraFor the rest of the parts such as optimization, advanced graphic or steam workshops and so on, I am not gonna review at the current stage because the game is not actually finished.Final Score:Planet Coaster(8+9+6+8+9+8+3) / 7 = 7.3Rollercoaster Tycoon World(4+6+7+7+0+5+6) / 7 = 5.0			"

								So I understood why the first beta weekened was bad, and didn't judge. Then they skipped the next weekends for the pre-orders. They lied about the December release date, then did not post any news for MONTHS. All of the sudden they come out with early access, and the game is just as bad as it was last October. Terrible FPS just trying to play (I have verey good specs.) The path system is a joke, I can't connect paths without FPS loss, and weird snap issues and bugs. Coaster editor... What? It makes no sense. RCT 3 is so much better than this, even graphics wise. It was released in 2004. I reccomend buying Roller Coaster Tycoon 3. Not this.			"

And many themes available.Rollercoaster Tycoon World 5/10Acceptable but still needs to be polished, the cars parked outside are repeated and meaning nothing, and there are only 2 types of themes (meadowland and western). Vista is super ugly,2.4 PathPlanet Coaster 3/10Very bad path algorithm. I can not build stright paths and build linear stations, too bad, please redesign your algorithm for path system.Rollercoaster Tycoon World 6/10Path system is OK. I can build stright and bend paths as I want but still a little bit harder. And another very bad thing is the path seems to be floating on the land surface instead of stay right on the land surface, which makes the game looks cheaper.3 ExtraFor the rest of the parts such as optimization, advanced graphic or steam workshops and so on, I am not gonna review at the current stage because the game is not actually finished.Final Score:Planet Coaster(8+9+6+8+9+8+3) / 7 = 7.3Rollercoaster Tycoon World(4+6+7+7+0+5+6) / 7 = 5.0			"

Early Access Review
								So I understood why the first beta weekened was bad, and didn't judge. Then they skipped the next weekends for the pre-orders. They lied about the December release date, then did not post any news for MONTHS. All of the sudden they come out with early access, and the game is just as bad as it was last October. Terrible FPS just trying to play (I have verey good specs.) The path system is a joke, I can't connect paths without FPS loss, and weird snap issues and bugs. Coaster editor... What? It makes no sense. RCT 3 is so much better than this, even graphics wise. It was released in 2004. I reccomend buying Roller Coaster Tycoon 3. Not this.			"

								Had it since last year and was hoping for a full release.Then they came whit the early access program and i was like ""ok maaaaybe it will be good""Yesterday i tried it, boosted all my graphics to max and was hopeful to try the game.I was speechless, How can a game, that had many release changes and after the planned release date went to early access status, be sooo bad!After 5mins in game it hurts to see that the name rollercoaster has become this …… well to be polite “bad”It’s really a shame that seeing this game, my hopes for a good new rollercoaster tycoon named game is gone.I had no choice to ask for a refund and thx to steam for the fast response because this kind of stuff can’t be supported especially when you had all the time to make things perfect.Kind regards from a hurt tycoon fan.

								I truly belive this will be a great game once it's finally finished, but for now there are some serious problems.  My main complaint is with the new paths engine.  This is the way you build and connect paths and queues in the game, and it is borderline unusable becuase connecting to existing paths is difficult and building grid-aligned paths has been made harder in order to support more organic shapes.  The developers claim this is one area of focus for improvement, which is the only redeeming factor.Beyond that, there are various graphic bugs I've noticed while playing and sometimes the rides just stop running and need a manual stop and start.  The game itself has even locked up while loading and exiting.  Maybe in a couple updates I can change this review, but for now, older versions of the game are better.			"

								I bought this game in the hopes of great fun! But instead I got afustrating not simple game which i am not keen to play again until some drastic updates has happened for the game! I really am sad that the mouse cursor when moved to the corner the map moves with you like previous games also I spent half hour trying to make a curvy pathway and failed. Also i couldn't rotate my rides like previous games ONE simple click to turn it right or left with simple arrow icons. PLEASE MAKE IT EASIER TO ROTATE THE RIDES AND MAKE IT SO THE CURSOR MOVES WITH YOU WHEN MOVED TO A CORNER. That will help a lot in making the game more simplistic and more fun to play. Graphics are great, lovely colour but the game is sadly too complicated compared to the older versions of this game which i love playing.			"

												After 11 hours of playing, (I am excluding graphics from my review) I just find this game not fun. It's clunky to play and the park management is difficult. Needs serious improvement, hopefully that will come in the next few months.As an updated many months later, the game has improved. Performance is far better, there is a new story mode which is nice and some more content. It still isn't what it could have been and seems aimed at a young target audience now. No water rides or transport rides on release. Supposed to be coming in the future, but I am not sure they an afford to do it.			"

								This game is not ready to be published.  If they would just  play the game for like 5 hours before releasing it, they would know that the game is messed up.  The system of deletion and snapping are jacked.  The mechanics get stuck and stop working.  The thoughts of the peeps just dissapear, never to return, but don't worry, they still get mad.  There is no easy way to find where your staff are, or figure out what they are doing.If you make the angle of the path exiting your rides at any more than 45 degrees, it won't allow you to make the queue and visa versa. I've also had a little trouble with connecting new paths to already built 1paths (not an issue of angle),The maintnence guys go back in as soon as they come out of the door of the buildig.  If they do make it out, pretty much all 10 of them are stuck together walking around.I am very dissapointed with this game.  I love the idea.  The problem that I see is that in the last couple of years, many gaame makers have been giving us broken games.  This is unacceptable.  The game litterally doesn't function.  I feel like I should be able to return this garbage and maybe buy it back if the designers get their crap together.It's appears that they focused so much on how the game would look, that they completely neglected making sure that if functioned propely			"

								Holy mother of god. Absolutely awful. 107 minutes in and I just couldn't take the mess any more. Already requested and received my refund.  This game was supposed to be out months ago... and here we are, 3 months late, and it's still 'early access'? I can understand a few glitches here and there, but this is ridiculous. 60% of the time, the game won't load, and when it does load, functions of the game won't turn off when switched on..... for example, I turned on the 'heat map' feature to find my most popular ride. The heat map would not disable and conveniently covered the menu button so I could not save and reload the game... 45 minutes of game gone to a rookie league glitch. The peeps are glitchy and half of them just 'float' instead of actually walk and move... the ride camera stops working and the peeps on the ride appear to detach from the ride and kind of hover over the seats.. this game that is incredibly late is almost unplayable. I wanted to like it. I really did. I've loved the genre since game 1, but Atari really screwed the pooch. I will be buying Planet Coaster which is made by the same people who created the first 2 rollercoaster tycoon games... Atari merely bought the name ""rollercoaster tycoon"" and destroyed it.Awful, Atari... just awful.			"

Never gonna buy anything again until its officially out, no mans sky is another example.

								Really had high hopes for this game, but they faded very quickly. I've put 3 hours in so far and I don't see myself reaching 4hrs any time soon. It just doesn't feel like it has evolved enough from RTC 3. It's still way too restrictive on placement and positioning and the spline coaster building had so much promise but is failing to deliver. The peeps are graphically no where near up to the standard they should be and look lost most of the time with poor animation to boot. It is currently possible to develop a good park but I don't feel the same enjoyment as I do with other similar games. Sadly would not recommend. I sincerely hope they continue to develop this game to a higher standard, but I think other titles out there are way beyond the reach of Atari.

								I'm a fan of the Roller Coaster Tycoon Franchise. I own RCT3. I was very excited to get my hands on this early access game. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. BUT, I was not able to play the game... At All... First off, i don't have the best computer, but it runs BeamNG Drive, Gmod, and other games bought on steam fine. When i first loaded a Sandbox park, my FPS dropped to about 0-10. I ignored that and started to build a Hyper Coaster. I could barely change the direction of the station. I scrolled my mouse wheel, then a few seconds later the station turned. I hovered over the thing where you design the track, then a few seconds later it allowed me to build the track. I would probably love this game if i could actually play it.So the point of my review is: You need a $600+ computer to run this game.			"

								I was NOT pleasantly surprised by this disappointing Early Access simulation. The interface offers very few options for tailoring the way you move around, and in its present form is frustratingly clumsy. Paths and Cues are hard to join up. Path lights and rubbish bins wont install on any path that is elevated, so some large parts of your park are in darkness. There doesn't appear to be any way of placing paths and tracks through hills, and etc.This game is not worth it for the price you pay. If it had been half what I paid for it (knowing that later I would have to buy addons like the RCT franchise has always worked) I may have taken the time to give feedback, and bide my time with it.Conclusion: Don't waste your money. By something else like I did.			"

Yesterday it came out and I wanted to feel the same as it felt like the 1st game. I went into sandbox and sadly discovered within 20min that the game is too easy. You can just build everything right from start and thats kinda it. No struggles to keep your park up from going bankrupt. I also dont like the new mechanics, how to make the streets. It looks really fancy but works like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Maybe they will fix things like this later on, sadly I refunded this game so I'm not going to see that happen.			"

Early Access Review
								In short, the game is still broken from every point of view, and looks worse compared to an alpha version of its competitor, Planet Coaster.I've been playing this game for some time now and on the positive side, it IS addicting to play the game. It's great to finally have a follow up in the Rollercoaster Tycoon franshice and for now i'm happy its here.Some complain about graphics, but I don't really mind looking at what amount of details I can put into the park and how large the park can get. The cartoony still looks great in this game and scrolling down to human level is beautiful in my opinion. I really want to give kudos for the devs for not resizing the levels into a Sim City disasteres small squares.But there is were it stops. Looking back to the beta, and now the Early Access (not release) no progress has been made at all. Building coasters is still as broken as it was in the beta. Random impossible twists are added as soon as you place a new piece that looked perfectly fine before placing it. And for some reason, a simple circle coaster is good enough to make everyone vomit and not liking your track. The only thing they fixed since the beta, is that they blame the user for not making a good coaster. THAT IS NOT FIXING THE BUG!The game is this bad, that even connecting two paths that run side by side is nearly impossible to do. It just doesn't connect! How can this problem still be in the game! Even when it starts to work, its a big hassle to make it do what you want to do because it just doesn't do what you want.In case you're into making the park look nice with a lot of small details and such. You're out of luck with this game. For example, adding benches or lights is a BIG PROBLEM. It's really incosistent and just doesn't allow you to create something nice. The game is keep saying you can't place an item there, when it is able to do it on the other side at exactly the same place and conditions.AI is also broken. People are 100% hungry, and walk like they really are hungry. But even with a street full of different shops to eat (with prices at $0, and food quality high) they won't eat. The cleanup crew randomly walks through everything and everyway, but barelly cleans something up. I've got over 500 people hired, and it's still a big mess. They even walk over the vomit or trash not doing anything.I even got a coaster that went broken as soon as I opened it. Even over 500 mechanics, even a few buildings next to that coaster wasn't going to help me having it fixed. And fixing it manually isn't possible. So I had to redo the coaster. Great!The other big promise is that you can use User Generated Content. Thats great, but they have no search or filter functionality. No sorting, nothing. It's as bare as it can get. And even than... even than, they can make it crash the game almost everytime you try using it. Losing your game process.Thats anothing thing. In what age are we living in? 1995? Are we still getting ""Oops I forgot to save, now I lost everything because of a bug/crash"" conversations. Has any of the devs ever heard of autosaving / creating backups?The game is as bad as it's beta, and even with the current trend of people hating the game, the money and time the devs will be allowed to fix it will be even more limited. This is just another cash in, a way to steal our money.Don't buy it, hopefully Planet Coaster will do better. But that is something we only can see in the future. I hope this game doesn't ruin the franchise and the next game will be better!			"

Designing your park is fun, the rides are good and the content already in the game is of good quality.Sure, its got a few frustrations and it isnt quite finished - but it is Early Access...so these are to be expected.With a few more updates this game will be even more fun and certainly worth your time.

								The game takes forever to load once you have more than a dozen or so rides in your park. Once you have a park the size of 3 of the land squares it literally takes 10 minutes or more to load your map. There are VERY few rides. Definitely not enough to fill the 9 land squares you can get up to. The mechanics don't work properly. I seriously have at least 30 mechanics and they all just sit in their building waiting for assignment while my rides stay broken. I love the RCT franchise and I saw the negtive reviews and thought ""No way. It's RCT. It can't be bad.""I was wrong.			"

												Beta Review....Not recommend, game is in an un-playable state...I did not say un-finished...but un-playable. The coaster builder is back to front? It's not very simple at all! When building a coaster you have to look for the colour markings under the track to see how safe or un-safe it is...White - OKAY! Everythings Great!Yellow - Hmmm unsure but might be fine?Red - You're proper f*cked, your guests are going to die.Black - Unplaceable piece of track!As you can only build coasters, decor, paths and queues in the beta. I would love to re-write this for when the game releases. I hope Atari put ALOT more effort in and fire the guy who said this was ready for a beta/demo. Whatever you want to call it these days!!			"

								Despite all of the negative reviews, this game really isn't that terrible. Although there are some annoying bugs and some funky features, none of them are really game destroying. There's been a lot of hate about things not snapping correctly, or things not snapping at all, and although it is a bit annoying, there's really easy ways to work around it. People have been commenting about the graphics as well too, and although they aren't top notch, they are pretty good, and much better than RCT3. So yes, it is buggy, it still has many problems, but in reality, none of these are truely game destroying bugs. Me and my girlfriend think this game is absolutely amazing and look forward to playing another 6 hours tomorrow. Let's just hope for some basic fixes too, and I'm sure this game will pull through, just like the others did! :)			"

I try it again a few days later and I can't get it past the menu screen again. I at least expected to be able to play the game smoothly especially on my gaming rig. If you want to buy this I would suggest waiting for them to fix these problems before wasting your money on a broken game. Its too bad though I love the RollerCoaster games and had high hopes for this one, guess I'll try Planet Coaster.			"

												Pros: Fun. Cons: Freezes constantly.  I honestly love the game, when it actually works for me. The negatives that I've seen, not from other reviews, but from my own experiences, out weigh the good, but only  because I can't experience good features of the game if I can't play it. It either freezes up, causing me to have to restart my computer because not only do I lose the ability to move the mouse pointer, not one shortcut to the desktop will work, or it stalls so long that I think it's frozen. I tried giving it time to load one night. It literally sat on the loading screen, trying to open my park, for roughly 10 minutes, then an additional to wait for the game to work and become unpaused once it was open. When it's not freezing or stalling, there's other glitches like peeps showing up where they shouldn't, paths for some reason not being accessable even though they've been checked several times, and just other things that aren't really huge, but frustrating and make game play unenjoyable. I have played it alot lately because I will load my screen, get really into my park, loving the graphics, the way the rides flow, and then it'll crash and I'll have to hard reset or open task manager if I can even get it to go back to the desktop to close the program. I've gotten in a few hours like that, I'll play for a while, then BAM, frozen, and always at the most successful or suspensful parts of my park's development, then because I want to continue with my park, I'll hop right back in just for it to do it again, sometimes not even making passed the menu. But, don't get me wrong,  I have played for hours on the good nights that it functions well too, it can get addicting. But it's sad when you really like your park and before you can save it, it freezes. To be honest, besides the bad glitches, I really enjoyed the game, I just have to save my it between every 5 and 10 minutes so that I don't risk losing what I worked on.  I cautiously recommend this to my friends who enjoy these games, but I advise you to try using patience before immediately calling it a failure. I really have liked it, it just works your nerve up more than it probably should.  It's new, so hopefully some updates can fix the problems. I'll have hope.			"

Early Access Review
								Game demands a lot out of the cpu, FAR more then the recommended spec, so either the spec is a lie or the game is SERIOUSLY un optimized. This wouldn't be an issue, if the game wasn't delayed so damn long making me believe that it will never get fixed. This is compounded with a shocking lack of content, and questionable time management, as the food stalls have 3-5 themes each, while rides and coasters are lacking. The little positives things I can say about the game are its far easier to build a working coaster and get people to ride them then prior games, building the roller coasters is fun but when ridden first person you see how lumpy the things are even when building them with the button placements apposed to the... what is this called, nurbs... I don't know, I don't like that way to build coasters at all.I don't know whats under the hood of if its fixable but there is no excuse for how badly this game runs. Lets also be clear, I'm no fan of planet coaster and think so many aspects of that game are worse then this one, largely due to me not being creative enough to build custom things that look nice. If you want a roller coaster game, rct2 with the opencrt2 mod, some people love rct3, or the new and possibly best roller coaster game, Parkitect are what you should be looking at, the 2 big hitters (this and planet coaster) rely to much on mods and community to be fun for me... I mean how much worse can I feel when people put crap up with the in game tools and I cant make a single thing look presentable? Its entirely possible this game will turn around, be very optimized and with mods be the best game around... and if it is ill buy it again then, but I'm not holding out hope.			"

Unbelievable that they had the nerve to release such a mediocre, no sorry poor excuse for a game. it loads faster than it did thats due to it being very very low quality textures and animations on all assets.

Early Access Review
								Okay. When I first made a review for this game, I just did standard criticizing. However, the game has updated since and deserves a fair review, as they have fixed many things. I will break this game up into parts and review each one seperetely.Interface:By interface, I mean the translucent, white bar at the bottom of the screen ingame. It is, well, okay. It gives you what you need, but it does not do it efficently. It seperates rides from rollercoasters, but that is just small nitpick I have. I really hate how stall types are merged into 4 small sections with only 2 being useful. It is okay, but you cannot search for stalls as a whole. There have been many times I have wanted sci-fi/western/normal/adventure theme only and had to look thouroughly to even find the stall itself. In tries to go for a more modern look by making everything unocolored, line drawn icons. It only makes things harder to pick out. It also is inneficent in other ways. In one tab, there is a whole entire area dedicated to facades. It, however, contains barely anything. Instead of trying to make more, they just created a tab of them and put a few dumb things in to make it look complete. Not to mention that I usually go there looking for terrain coloring and clicking on it (because it is a spray can). Maybe I want to look for a roller coaster and click on rides? Though that, itself, is a small issue, it is still ANNOYING and easy to prevent. The interface does have it's pros though. It moved on from RCT3's circle interface that was literally everywhere and hard to navigate across and instead had a normal interface at the bottom of the screen. It also does look nice. I would just rather functionality over design. I give it a 4/10.scenarios:I have to be honest, I hate the new scenarios. I had true fun playing the sceanarios in RCT3. I have no fun with the new scenarios, and I knew I would hate them all when I played the first. Instead of being put in a well established park that has a lot of room for improvement, I was put in a nearly 100% complete park and told to make new stuff with a predefined pathway (yes, I know I could change it if I wanted to) in 12 months. It already had about every resturaunt, and it had no ""Discovery"" feature that would let me unlock new stuff as time went on. I do like the return of the scenario creator, however. I have no dabbled in it that much yet (I will explain why later), but I love that they have reintroduced one great feature in the series. While I like that scenarios are included and applaud the developers for taking the time to make what would otherwise be a sanbox game into a game that you can actually PLAY for a reason. While I hate the scenarios, I do appreciate the scenario editor and that the developers even added them in. Therefore, I give this feature a 7.5/10sandbox:This is the true reason (and in my opinion one of the only reasons) to buy this game. While limitations do still apply, I still love the ability to be able to create the theme park of my dreams. I have had hours of fun in sandbox mode and have even spent a whole day working on my park at one time. It was a mess, but it was fun. I do, however, not like the restrictions that are applied. I will, however, get into that in a later area. I really do like the sandboxes of othger games better though. This one is good, but it is not the best. It lacks features that those ones have, but it is FUN, and that is what mainly matters. Though this area is short, that is because I really do not have that much negativity for it. Therefore, I give the sandbox mode an 8.5/10. It is mainly good, but I have see better.Items:By items, I mean stalls, decorations, and paths. Let's start out with stalls. I like the new twist on the game by adding buildings as a bigger form of stalls, but I am dissapointed with smaller stalls and am indifferent on the choice to add staff buidlings. The small stalls are pretty bad. There are small things, like ketchup and mustard bottles on sci-fi souveneir stores (which is just outright laziness), but there are alsobig things. I really hate the lack of stall types. There are many, yes, but explain to me why the only small stall that has a drink is the soda stall. That is PURE laziness. It is hard to be creative with stalls when I have already placed every single one in a small park 3 times already. Now, staff buildings are OKAY. It is cool to have a building with workers that makes it where you don't have to spam the hire button, but it makes staff take up so much space. It is outright annoying. Even bathrooms (which are not staff, I know) take up a ton of space. I like the new bathrooms, ya, but the developer's were too lazy to implement the tiny, dirty stalls that is so common in theme parks It is just annoying. I rate this third of this section 4.5/10. I will now be moving onto decoraqtions. Theya re what really spice upthe park, and I have mostly postive words to say about them. They look nice, and even trees are randomized. I will rather be criticizing what is NOT added. There is one big thing missing, buidling materials! How can you make a good aprk when you cannot even add a wall! Parkitect and Planet Coaster do this so well, so why does Roller Coaster Tycoon World fail? Onlt the developer's know. I like the return of UGC and the new addition of using the Workshop to find and apply it easily. I, however, don't like how they are just lifeless statues. In RCT3, I had a poorly made McDonalds stall that actually worked! In RCTW, I have a giant building with incredible detail... that does nothing. Atari really messed up here. I can only hop that they will fix this. I really liek the decorations, but I hate what they don;t have. Therefore, I am giving them a 7/10. Next, we have paths.I have a sort of love hate relationship with the paths. They are good, yes. However, they are such a pain to use! They give them dumb rules, like ""You can only expand this path if you delete this one then put it back in the exact same place after you are done."" That is so dumb. Curved paths, while being a nice addtion, are impossible to use! I ill struugle and struggle with them,a nd I usyually give up on REGULAR paths! Plus, if you don't use grid or snap, they will be all wonky and off center! They could try to reintroduce path blocks, but I don't think they will. I do, however, really like them with grid/snap. It makes using them so much easier! I just don't like that they are basically required! Because of these mixed views, I give paths a 7/10. Therefore, my overall rating for these 3 are 6.2/10. I wish I could have given them a better rating.Terrain:Terrain sculpting is really nice, but I don't have many words to say about it. The only real things I would change are the lack of the ability to make caves and the fact that I want more terrain colors in the paint tab. I do wish that they fixed placing items of bridges, however. They will just fall through (not when I place them but I literally cannot place them on the path) , and no one ikes that. I give terrain an 8/10.Fun:This game is actually REALLY fun. It is not great to any extent, but I like it. There is not that much more to say besides that it is fun, and that is what makes a game good. I give this an 8.5/10DLC:I liek the DLC, ya. I however wish it added a bit more. We get the classic mascot, 2 new themes, and a gold park entrance on those 2 themes. There is not much in this section because there is not much with DLC! It is good, but it is dissapointing. 7/10FInal Thoughts:Roller Coaster Tycoon World is a good game, but do I recommend it? To be honest, I really want to, but I don't. It just is not good compared to Parkitect and Planet Coaster, the 2 rollercoaster games of 2015-16 I absolutely love. Overall, I give RCTW an 8.1/10.			"

								I had very high hopes for this game. What with them pushing back the orginal release date and with previous RCT games, I was under the imression that this game was going to be amazing... Sadly, I was terribly wrong. After playing only 45 minutes of the game, I uninstalled and got a refund. I hate to say it, but I believe this is the end of the RCT series. If you really want to try a good rollercoaster game, Planet Coaster is the way to go.			"

												So preordered this bucket awhile back.  Cant really say anything other than what most others allready have.  I have respects for the efforts here, but its almost 2017 and i seriously still can't even play this game.  Not in terms of how awful it is, its literally unplayable.  You start the game and get nothing but a black screen, for some reason the only way around it is to bring up the steam overlay (shift+tab) to refresh the loading or something. ok.. so you get passed one hurdle of just opening the bloody thing. Lets now start to play, looks fine and dandy loads her up, ok sweet... nope.  Now the cursor is just flashing and stuck in the middle of the screen haha. You can try to move it but snag pops right back. C'mon fellas, could just be nostalgia talking, but why did you all have to go all simcity with it.  Sometimes its just better to leave these things to rest.  I recommend just sticking to the older versions 1-3, this one is just a mess and doesnt look to be getting any better.			"

												Im Impressed that they managed to  make it worse. Lol its still the sh***y bugged game with a new frontend and new style of menu graphics. still cant place a straight path on a rides entrance and exit , its (been like this since first demo) 1  day and 1 night takes well over  2 weeks in game time to  happen. the ride paths still will not line up with anything, lol they have fixed nothing in fact my game runs far worse now that it ever has and it looks so so bad graphically its just a joke (not even close to a good joke). Unbelievable that they had the nerve to release such a mediocre, no sorry poor excuse for a game. it loads faster than it did thats due to it being very very low quality textures and animations on all assets. Atari a name that will go down in history.			"

												This game was the biggest disappointment of 2016. If I could give something negative stars, this would be it.   I was talking about this game to everyone, just waiting for it to come out because I was so excited about it.   When I finally bought the game is almost made me cry with how awful it is.  It is nothing like the previous RCTs.  You also nearly need a manual just to figure out how to play the damn game.  If you're thinking about buying this because you loved the previous games, just dont.  It's definitely not even worth the money.  Ended up buying Planet Coaster which is much more in line with the previous RCTs and user-friendly.			"

Early Access Review
								Game demands a lot out of the cpu, FAR more then the recommended spec, so either the spec is a lie or the game is SERIOUSLY un optimized. This wouldn't be an issue, if the game wasn't delayed so damn long making me believe that it will never get fixed. This is compounded with a shocking lack of content, and questionable time management, as the food stalls have 3-5 themes each, while rides and coasters are lacking. The little positives things I can say about the game are its far easier to build a working coaster and get people to ride them then prior games, building the roller coasters is fun but when ridden first person you see how lumpy the things are even when building them with the button placements apposed to the... what is this called, nurbs... I don't know, I don't like that way to build coasters at all.I don't know whats under the hood of if its fixable but there is no excuse for how badly this game runs. Lets also be clear, I'm no fan of planet coaster and think so many aspects of that game are worse then this one, largely due to me not being creative enough to build custom things that look nice. If you want a roller coaster game, rct2 with the opencrt2 mod, some people love rct3, or the new and possibly best roller coaster game, Parkitect are what you should be looking at, the 2 big hitters (this and planet coaster) rely to much on mods and community to be fun for me... I mean how much worse can I feel when people put crap up with the in game tools and I cant make a single thing look presentable? Its entirely possible this game will turn around, be very optimized and with mods be the best game around... and if it is ill buy it again then, but I'm not holding out hope.			"

Early Access Review
								Okay. When I first made a review for this game, I just did standard criticizing. However, the game has updated since and deserves a fair review, as they have fixed many things. I will break this game up into parts and review each one seperetely.Interface:By interface, I mean the translucent, white bar at the bottom of the screen ingame. It is, well, okay. It gives you what you need, but it does not do it efficently. It seperates rides from rollercoasters, but that is just small nitpick I have. I really hate how stall types are merged into 4 small sections with only 2 being useful. It is okay, but you cannot search for stalls as a whole. There have been many times I have wanted sci-fi/western/normal/adventure theme only and had to look thouroughly to even find the stall itself. In tries to go for a more modern look by making everything unocolored, line drawn icons. It only makes things harder to pick out. It also is inneficent in other ways. In one tab, there is a whole entire area dedicated to facades. It, however, contains barely anything. Instead of trying to make more, they just created a tab of them and put a few dumb things in to make it look complete. Not to mention that I usually go there looking for terrain coloring and clicking on it (because it is a spray can). Maybe I want to look for a roller coaster and click on rides? Though that, itself, is a small issue, it is still ANNOYING and easy to prevent. The interface does have it's pros though. It moved on from RCT3's circle interface that was literally everywhere and hard to navigate across and instead had a normal interface at the bottom of the screen. It also does look nice. I would just rather functionality over design. I give it a 4/10.scenarios:I have to be honest, I hate the new scenarios. I had true fun playing the sceanarios in RCT3. I have no fun with the new scenarios, and I knew I would hate them all when I played the first. Instead of being put in a well established park that has a lot of room for improvement, I was put in a nearly 100% complete park and told to make new stuff with a predefined pathway (yes, I know I could change it if I wanted to) in 12 months. It already had about every resturaunt, and it had no ""Discovery"" feature that would let me unlock new stuff as time went on. I do like the return of the scenario creator, however. I have no dabbled in it that much yet (I will explain why later), but I love that they have reintroduced one great feature in the series. While I like that scenarios are included and applaud the developers for taking the time to make what would otherwise be a sanbox game into a game that you can actually PLAY for a reason. While I hate the scenarios, I do appreciate the scenario editor and that the developers even added them in. Therefore, I give this feature a 7.5/10sandbox:This is the true reason (and in my opinion one of the only reasons) to buy this game. While limitations do still apply, I still love the ability to be able to create the theme park of my dreams. I have had hours of fun in sandbox mode and have even spent a whole day working on my park at one time. It was a mess, but it was fun. I do, however, not like the restrictions that are applied. I will, however, get into that in a later area. I really do like the sandboxes of othger games better though. This one is good, but it is not the best. It lacks features that those ones have, but it is FUN, and that is what mainly matters. Though this area is short, that is because I really do not have that much negativity for it. Therefore, I give the sandbox mode an 8.5/10. It is mainly good, but I have see better.Items:By items, I mean stalls, decorations, and paths. Let's start out with stalls. I like the new twist on the game by adding buildings as a bigger form of stalls, but I am dissapointed with smaller stalls and am indifferent on the choice to add staff buidlings. The small stalls are pretty bad. There are small things, like ketchup and mustard bottles on sci-fi souveneir stores (which is just outright laziness), but there are alsobig things. I really hate the lack of stall types. There are many, yes, but explain to me why the only small stall that has a drink is the soda stall. That is PURE laziness. It is hard to be creative with stalls when I have already placed every single one in a small park 3 times already. Now, staff buildings are OKAY. It is cool to have a building with workers that makes it where you don't have to spam the hire button, but it makes staff take up so much space. It is outright annoying. Even bathrooms (which are not staff, I know) take up a ton of space. I like the new bathrooms, ya, but the developer's were too lazy to implement the tiny, dirty stalls that is so common in theme parks It is just annoying. I rate this third of this section 4.5/10. I will now be moving onto decoraqtions. Theya re what really spice upthe park, and I have mostly postive words to say about them. They look nice, and even trees are randomized. I will rather be criticizing what is NOT added. There is one big thing missing, buidling materials! How can you make a good aprk when you cannot even add a wall! Parkitect and Planet Coaster do this so well, so why does Roller Coaster Tycoon World fail? Onlt the developer's know. I like the return of UGC and the new addition of using the Workshop to find and apply it easily. I, however, don't like how they are just lifeless statues. In RCT3, I had a poorly made McDonalds stall that actually worked! In RCTW, I have a giant building with incredible detail... that does nothing. Atari really messed up here. I can only hop that they will fix this. I really liek the decorations, but I hate what they don;t have. Therefore, I am giving them a 7/10. Next, we have paths.I have a sort of love hate relationship with the paths. They are good, yes. However, they are such a pain to use! They give them dumb rules, like ""You can only expand this path if you delete this one then put it back in the exact same place after you are done."" That is so dumb. Curved paths, while being a nice addtion, are impossible to use! I ill struugle and struggle with them,a nd I usyually give up on REGULAR paths! Plus, if you don't use grid or snap, they will be all wonky and off center! They could try to reintroduce path blocks, but I don't think they will. I do, however, really like them with grid/snap. It makes using them so much easier! I just don't like that they are basically required! Because of these mixed views, I give paths a 7/10. Therefore, my overall rating for these 3 are 6.2/10. I wish I could have given them a better rating.Terrain:Terrain sculpting is really nice, but I don't have many words to say about it. The only real things I would change are the lack of the ability to make caves and the fact that I want more terrain colors in the paint tab. I do wish that they fixed placing items of bridges, however. They will just fall through (not when I place them but I literally cannot place them on the path) , and no one ikes that. I give terrain an 8/10.Fun:This game is actually REALLY fun. It is not great to any extent, but I like it. There is not that much more to say besides that it is fun, and that is what makes a game good. I give this an 8.5/10DLC:I liek the DLC, ya. I however wish it added a bit more. We get the classic mascot, 2 new themes, and a gold park entrance on those 2 themes. There is not much in this section because there is not much with DLC! It is good, but it is dissapointing. 7/10FInal Thoughts:Roller Coaster Tycoon World is a good game, but do I recommend it? To be honest, I really want to, but I don't. It just is not good compared to Parkitect and Planet Coaster, the 2 rollercoaster games of 2015-16 I absolutely love. Overall, I give RCTW an 8.1/10.			"

												When I played, it was sh*t, so this review is based on my experience.First off, I bought this game for nearly $70? I paid the most because I wanted to ensure the game was getting funds to release the game, but what did I get in return? 3 Roller Coasters that were premade, and a terrible way to build your own rides. Sat in my chair for hours upon hours trying to create my own coaster, but it's just not happening. The game may have changed, but I am sure I am not the only one that has experienced this with the game. Anyone who was a ""FOUNDER"" like me must be pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at what we got, because it wasn't early access, this was pre Alpha that we got.

												It is almost unplayable. Everything is an effort to do. Building a rollercoaster should be fun, this is not. Really badly designed, Planet Coaster have got their controls down, play that instead. Also, barely any content such as objects/themes. None of it can be grouped for easy access. Seems to be a lot of glitches, I only paid £5 for this, and I wouldn't even say it's worth that much. This game is not what you would expect out of Rollercoaster Tycoon, I DO NOT RECOMMEND.

								Although still in the early stages of the build, it is nice to look at but I don't find the graphics very much different than 3.  However, it is an improvement in the way it looks.  Still very glitchy in that you can't place items precisely where you want them and have to go by a grid, which is very restricting.  45 minutes into the game and it starts eating up a lot of memory resources, then crashed.  This is what the first beta test should have looked like late last year but that test was a big joke.  When they mentioned that this would be out in early 2016, it appears that this is not going to happen.  It still needs a lot of work to smooth things out.  The tutorials don't really help as it seems to jump ahead of wht you are trying to do.  There is a learning curve to this game so hopefully all will emjoy.  If you are new at this, be patient and practice.  As of this moment, I cannot say whether I recommend this game or not.  Once the final build comes out I will be able to make that determination then.			"

I just dont understand RCT 3 was so smooth and granted you had to have alot of workers at least they worked! jesus the employees in this game are from your worst nightmares they are worthless.

												The game is very buggy and it will crash a lot. But remember this is the first beta weekend and we are 2 months away from release. They still have time to bug fix.The coaster creation has a very big learning curve because the game takes physics into account. Your coaster will not be able to make sharp hairpin curves, you need to bank your turns, slow the coaster down if its doing 90mph in a turn. This is why people are having issues and why it has such a higher learning curve than the other games. They should give you the option of the current system and the original piece by piece for the inpatient.Content in the game has all but been locked out for the current beta, because they want feedback on the coaster creation system. If you are patient and enjoyed the older games, then yes I reccomend this game, I loved the wild designs I created in my coasters. But again, it has a learning curve, do not expect to just jump right in and make a great coaster, physics, speed, gravity are now factored in, you are not going to make a turn if your coaster is flying at 100+mph.

								i have always played the rollercoaster tycoon titles. But this game is not like the other ones. the path editing is horrible. My game crashes a lot. I wish i could give a thumbs up but that is basically impossible. I would recommend PLANET COASTER frontier is just a better compagnie and they know what they are doing.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. RCT3 had been such a hit for me, and I have and still do enjoy it. I really wanted this game (RCTW) to continue this fantastic franchise - and so, I bought it. Sure, it has it's positives here and there, yet the majority of the game is negative. I do not recommend this game - however I do believe that with a long, hard revamp there might still be some potential in it. Why?Mainly because the few positives are excellently done. The coaster builder itself is fantastic, completely customizable and it the coasters look great too! If the game was redesigned I sincerely hope that this is one aspect of the game they keep, as I can tell some real thought has gone into it. The physics engine is also decent and does complement the coaster builder well. In my opinion the customizability of this coaster builder and the features of the coaster builder are far more advanced then the current state of Planet Coaster's rollercoaster designer.However, the rest of the game is seriously lagging behind when compared to Frontier's Planet Coaster. The framerate is TERRIBLE. I have many games with much better graphics that RCTW and yet they can achieve up to 6 times the framerate I get here - i've never exceeded 10fps in RCTW while I mantain roughly 50fps in Planet Coaster. Graphics - even on the highest setting - struggle to compete in appearance with Planet Coaster's ""medium-low"". The peeps look like they were designed by 8 year-olds and there is no real variation in them. When zoomed out the peeps glide along the ground and ARE NOT ANIMATED! The number of original coaster types in Planet Coaster also seems more realistic, while Planet Coaster's scenery options and variation beats RCTW by a long way. The main menu of RCTW is disgusting, as is the User Interface.This game needs an urgent, complete revamp. In that unlikely scenario, I'll consider changing my review.Until then?Buy Planet Coaster. It's so much better - and probably what you were actually looking for.			"

Early Access Review
								I am a big fan of RCT1 and 2 with all expansions they made. In fact RCT 1 was the best. So many levels you can play with different goals and lovly created maps. You really can see how much love the developers sent to RCT 1 and 2. But after RCT 3 was released it wasn't mine at all. The gameplay wasn't the focus anymore. Instead the graphics and the possibilties to drive your coasters were gone to be focused. But there were no lovely levels at all anymore.... So far to the old ones....Now to RCT W: This game, in fact, is nice to watch. The graphics are very well created and animated.... but that's, by far, is all I can review positve at all.I mean, you have to know it's still an Early-Access so it's still under development. But: There are so many bugs that the game is still unplayable. The service personals are stuck on roads. They neither move nor do their work. Some functions told in tips can't be used, e.g. the service personal's route. You can't change or even select anythin like this.The placement of roads, coasters and buildings are terrible. You made a road and cross it with another. Then, because of the crossing point, you aren't even able to put bins or banks onto the roads or lanterns.... Banks, bins or anything like these are small tiles which cannot be placed on a big road because another is crossing it... there is a big place you cannot build onto... Hope they fix it...People's movement is broken. They do not walk over the raods, they are flying over it when you scroll out of the map.The pathfinding is better then in RCT 1 where people run completly random on the raods. Here they take the way they want to get the coaster of their choice. But the movement is still buggy and broken...And at least, to make it more funny... I only have a notebook with notebok graphics... but it is still a GTX980M. One of the heigher graphic cards.... and After each building and attraction my framerate drops little lower... I begin this game with 60 FPS. After 3 Coasters and several other attractions my frames cannot climb over 21 per seconds.... That's not normal... I have tested different maps and coaster types and everytime the same issues... Building more attractions decrease FPS. Seems that the graphic is rendering everything in the park even if you are not focusing the attraction in the active window.... And by that: The game is using 3 GB RAM (active) and the cpu-usage ist too damned high... Even a mondern shooter or anything like that is not using more 20% of cpu  (got a Intel core i7-4720 HQ) but this game is using up to 70%... I do not know whether the cpu is supporting the graphics and whether the graphics are made within the cpu... but at this level with all this bugs and mistakes and mismakes... the game isn't worth to be bought... And never worth to be bought at this price...I will look forwards for updates and may update this review when updates make it better... otherwise I won't spend any time at all in wrinting for this game... Seems that I need to look closer to planet coaster too :/Chris Sawyer.... please come back and rescue this amazing game you made early we all loved			"

												I played every single RCT that came out and I was actually excited for this game. I am sorry to say that it was a huge let down. Yes it is pretty and can be fun for the first hour but after that, it just falls flat... Not enough things in it to keep me busy. I keep hearing good things about PC, so I may go to that one. It just sucks to see this one go down the drain. Maybe, just maybe, the devs will improve this a lot. I will update this if the game changes...***UPDATE***- I will no longer be updating this review about RCTW as I have given in to buying PC and was not let down. I will just say that if you were a fan of RCT1 and 2 then I will have to say that I am very pleased that PC was the exact direction in which the series was supposed to go! I would rate PC 100/10 if I could. You will not be dissapointed. As a matter of fact I would have paid $60 for PC! Happy Tycooning!			"

								Played the game for 100 minutes (20minutes after you account for the lag, buffering, loading, ect) I had major trouble with pathing as it fustrated me along with the building style for coasters. the game was jumpy like it was continually trying to catch up and my frame rate was utterly rediculous. Alot to be fixed but i think im moving on this was just to hard to deal with and i have found another coaster builder that gives me much more freedom of imagination. RCTW cheers.			"

												Roller coaster Tycoon is awful. The game should not have been released in the state in it was in. The Developers should be ashamed for delivering a product that is absolutely plagued by bugs and looks 10 years old. Planet coaster even in its early stage was far more Superior than Roller Coaster Tycoon world. The developers should have taking notes of a planet coaster was turning out to be and just scrapped it and start over with Roller Coaster Tycoon world. Don't waste your time or money. Planet coaster as far superior and I strongly recommend Planet coaster over Roller Coaster Tycoon world.			"

												READ THIS ONE: I bought the Early Release. It was okay, at best. Then when the game was released a week ago, it became far better with more things to do. Then something changed yesterday and now the game will not load at all. The change was in Steam. I was made to agree to a massive legal document before I could continue playing. The joke was on me though, because the game quit loading after that. This game had potential and I held off from getting Planet Coaster simply because I have been loyal to the branding of RCT. Now however, since Steam has made it impossible to load the game and there's no way to switch back to before I clicked on I Agree, it may be time to give up on Atari.Asus G11CDWindows 10 (64 bit)nVidia GeForce GTX 950i5-6400 2.79 Ghz8.00 GB RAM			"

								I would not recomend this game, the main reasons being that A: it has no modular building system (so a heck of a lot of creativity and freedom lost), B: the graphics are pretty appalling and un-optimised (i guess there's only so much quality you can get in unity) and lastly C: the price is way too high for what you actually get, when Planet Coaster is selling for £19.99, (in my opinon the better one of the main two AND you get more with it...) it is a no brainer to go Frontier's way.In conclusion, if you want something that pushes your creativity and allows you to freely build the park you wan't, this game is definiltey not for you. Just either pre-order Planet Coaster and save £10 or wait till the full release and get it for thirty. Don't buy this, you will regret it.  2/10			"

								I have a pretty decent computer, great CPU, GPU, tons of ram and STILL I have gamebreaking lagspikes. The game is fun, the graphics are a decent upgrade and it does bring back the great feeling from the older games.However as long as the lag affects the game as it does, I simply can't recommend the game. Once you've put an hour or two into your themepark, it's basicly game over because of lag spikes.Even turning down graphics to a minimum doesn't solve the issue. And i'm only playing in 1080p..Once they fix the lag, I will support it again. Untill then I feel like this game has been a complete waste of money and time. (I know it's early access, but the lag issues has been there for nearly a year now. Starting to worry that they're never gonna be able to fix it.)			"

								I have played and loved the RollerCoaster Tycoon games for years. Unfortunately I do have to agree with a lot of the negative reviews.The game is nowhere near ready. It's poorly optimized, very buggy and is missing important features. But on saying that it is a early access game so I didn't expect it to be perfect.I love building rollercoasters, I never used pre made coasters in RCT3 and I don't plan to in this either but after 2 hours of trying to build a coaster I gave up because you have to mess about with to many things just to get the right angle on the track. I do like the fact that there are more options in coaster building but I think they took it slightly to far.A few things I want to see in the game is a 'basic' and 'advanced' option on coaster building, basic being the same as RCT3. Edge scrolling is a must for me to, I hate having to move the camera around with the keyboard all the time. Bulldozing is annoying to as you can only delete a single thing at a time so if you have a load of trees, plants or scenery you want to get rid of it takes ages! They need to add a click and drag system to delete multiple things at once and when placing objects and rides, auto delete trees and plants that are in the way.I could go on but at the moment I can't recommend buying this game. The devs are saying they are working hard on the game but it isn't getting many updates yet.I really hope they get this game right in the end but its looking like 2 or 3 months before I can make a final decision.

The game is fun, the graphics are a decent upgrade and it does bring back the great feeling from the older games.However as long as the lag affects the game as it does, I simply can't recommend the game. Once you've put an hour or two into your themepark, it's basicly game over because of lag spikes.Even turning down graphics to a minimum doesn't solve the issue. And i'm only playing in 1080p..Once they fix the lag, I will support it again. Untill then I feel like this game has been a complete waste of money and time. (I know it's early access, but the lag issues has been there for nearly a year now. Starting to worry that they're never gonna be able to fix it.)			"

								I had high hopes.  The paths don't work. They're not intutive and just don't do what they should do. You can't demolish a section of property; instead, you  have to click on one item at a time.  If you want to build where there's trees, flowers and shrubs, each and every item  needs to be deleted one at a time.  Can't drop buildings on the edge of the pathways.  You build them on the edge and then have to add a short path.The administration and developers sholdn't quit their day jobs to do this professionally.  Dominos always needs good drivers.  Maybe they should stick with what they know and develop games for the 2600.			"

												I was sooooo bumped up when I heard about this game coming out soon, since I played constant years of RCT3, THE best park simulator game ever. When it was out for early access, I bought it immediately.I played for about 30 minutes until the game decides to stop, then crashes. I thought it must've been a temporary error, but I was wrong. Constantly, the game crashes ever 20 minutes of gameplay and I have to save my game every time I make a small change to my park.I'm sorry RCT developers, but this game needs to be fixed. I am very disappointed. :(			"

												So I was hoping that they would have fixed many of the issues for the full release but alas, it's still a piece of garbage.  The AI is still messed up, coaster construction is clumsy, path placement is not all that nice.  And to top it off, every once in a while the game feels the need to whipe my saves.  So I no longer have any parks.  This game is a disaster.  It's only a matter of time before there aren't even enough people playing it to justify supporting the game.  So forget about new content or even getting these bugs fixed.  They are going to abandon it sooner rather than later.  Believe the reviews you are reading... they are true.			"

								I have only a little time with the game, regardless of what my hours played says, because I left it running while I was working on mods. Overall, I can't really recommend it. The one time I  actually tried to play the campaign, it crashed on me within 10 minutes.Pros:Creating a model and getting it into the game is super easy if you're familiar with Unity. I spent almost all my free time this weekend modeling and then testing it in the game. I'm going to enjoy making models for this game.Game is looking better. It still needs some work, but I feel there's a good balance between graphics and performance. Cons:Crashed within 10 minutes of actually attempting to play the campaign. I'm not interested in sandbox mode except to test my models; I want the management sim part of the game as much as the rest.Modding side of the game is sorely missing some features, like the ability to give names to the individual models in a pack, set their prices, and give them descriptions.Seriously lacking in decoratives. Sure, we can fill that section out, but they should provide a fair number of them, too. Could never download anyone else's UGC. It always hung up on me.04/21 Edit: UGC is still messed up after latest (04/20) patch. Most of the time I can't even see the UGC I made, and I can only see some of what other people made.----------I expect to change my review some day, but unless you want to make scenery objects for the game, I'd hold out on buying it right now.

												After logging over 100 hrs of Alpha and Final I have come to the conclusion that RCTW is mo where near as bad as being spoke of here. Methinks most reviewers that are looking for a RPG mode. Of course I am in my seventies and have the patient of a saint which helps when you are building frames for the shops. If you take your time and learn the little twists and turns the game is  kind of fun. I have built and destroyed several parks already and am learning more each time I have played. Too be fair, it isn't as good as the Frontier model, I also have, and that is probably why most people dislike RTCW. The Frontier game plays and redesmbles the former RCT 3D. I find that coaster building is easier on RCTW.Don't hate the game until you have dspent some time on it.PS The Frontier version terrain feature is fantastic compared to this one.			"

								Don't even bother getting this.There's not a single sniff of the original RCT feeling to be found anywhere.It feels more like a design concept than a game.The amount of stuff broken is mind blowing. (granted it's early access but still - read next line)The original release date was gonna be around now (Q1 2016) and suddenly it's early access? It doesn't even feel like it left pre-alpha!As a matter of fact, this might be the first I'm probably gonna refund.Play RCT 1, much better than whatever this was supposed to be.			"

								Well the game isnt as bad as most people think untill your game gets to around 5 tiles. when its past 4 or 5 tiels and you try to reaload the save it takes forever. (15 mins before i decided to give up. This is on an intel i7 processor with 32gb of ram and an Nvidia quadro m6000 graphics card). In my oppinion the rollercoaster tycoon seris was grate untill atari decided to create roller coaster tycoon 4 for mobile and this junk. From a game developer that works in unity, atari you have just made your second game that would have caused the games insustry to crash. if this was a disc based game i am sure it would have been burid allong side ET! oh and atari this time dont try and blame it on you changing the name from atari 2600 to 5200!currently would not buy this game.

								While the new RollerCoaster Tycoon World early access, it is quite clear there are some major flaws. Althought it plays a huge factor in the judgement of the game, it is also essential to note that the game is in early access and undergoing developement. But, the tragedy this game has brought me through is simply no exception for the franchise, RollerCoaster Tycoon World better get it's s*** together before release. Aside from that, I am here to shed some light on why the game is so bad right now and why you shouldn't waste your money on this game if it continues in this downhill spiral. Pros:Rollercoaster building is new and innovativeThe game allows more freedom for the playerDive Coasters are a great addition to the listStations and chain lifts are betterCons (brace yourselves):Lack of coasters and rides you can buildTONS of major bugs involving building placement and tracksThe game may be too free for those who like to keep things straightYou can't pick up people anymore :(Game has some s*** graphics for some major lagCoaster camera is somewhat stiffCoaster train editing is blandCoaster entertainment means you can't build scary s*** or no one will ride it cause they're p******(Seriously, one drop and a loop will put your coaster to a 1 in excitement)HEIGHT LIMITS!!! (Hyper coasters can't even go past 300)The price of the damn game for this s***No chain lift catwalk beneath for inverted coastersOnly one side of chainlift for most regular coasterReally? no undoing a mistake (RIP Ctrl + Z)UI makes me want to commit SeppekuParks are dirty as s*** even with loads of janitorsNO WATER RIDESEA would prob do a better job at making this gameCareer mode is a jokeI prob missed some stuff but you get the point.INB4 9/10 -IGNBut seriously, keep your wallets safe out there kids.

												A giant middle finger to everyone that ever tried to support this game. At one point, before it was even early access, i was hyped about this game. Imagine my pain when i first played it, and realised it was a buggy, ugly, messy and complete faceplant for the series. It was like being sat there on your birthday with a big box in front of you, you think it's that gaming pc you've been wishing for. You open it, and find a rotting budgie thats been mauled by 2 bulldogs and sprayed at with a shotgun. Thank you very much Nvizzio, i hope that this dark cloud of shame hovers over you for the rest of your game making days.			"

												The development of this game has been a rollercoaster of high intensity and nasuea. Originally intended to be released late 2015, they have switched to releasing it now as early access. For many (including me), the game suffers from performance problems. I do want to see if the game is improving, but I'm still behind a performance wall. Many have given up on this game and looked towards some similar alternatives (like revisiting the older games), but a small sliver of me is still curious about the fate of this game.When I'm able to play this game to a better extent, I'll re-review it. But for now, don't buy it (especially for such a high price).Update Nov. 17th: I can't review a game I still can't play. Don't make the mistake I did and avoid buying this game.			"

								Do not buy this game for $50. It is a complete joke that they would even charge such a ridiculous price for such a game in its current state. I will say that this game is a lot of fun. The roller coaster creation is actuially pretty good (when it doesn't bug out). The main problem that i have with the game is that its VERY poorly optimized. It runs terribly. I could get a lot of enjoyment out of the game if it wasn't for the horrid performance. And i don't even mean like 15-20 FPS bad, I'm talking like a mediumish sized park with like 1900 people in it I get around 1-7 FPS. It is completely unplayable. I payed less than half of the steam price for this, and even then I still feel ripped off. If this game ever gets some optimization changes it would probably be a pretty enjoyable game, even with the lack of content in its current state.			"

								The game has potential to be something great... buuut with how it's looking so far, and from what i hear about the plans for it in the future, i can't possibly see myself enjoying this game very much. Why? i'll explain...First off, the small little rides you can set up here and there (ferris wheels, gravitron, merry go round, etc) are all nice and work flawlessly... But the moment I try building a  coaster, it just starts eating up SO MUCH MEMORY. Yes, this game uses up so much memory and processing, it's insane. It's definitely NOT optimized what so ever. I'm on a high end computer that can run just about every single game i have on here on max settings with flawless performance... but for some reason, this particular game, whenever I try building a coaster, or even spawn a premade one, it freezes up, crashes, and gives me a warning/error saying that too much memory is being used. Then java stops working, aaaand it dies all together. I learned this the hard way when I was spending a lot of time setting up paths, small rides, concessions, etc... and when i finally said ""Alright, i think it's time to build a coaster!"" Not even half way done with it, and it froze up and crashed and gave me that error. At first I though it was just an instance, so i booted it up again and gave it another go. Same thing. Any time I tried making a coaster,  it just died. So there goes all that time on an unsaved game. Oh yeah, that's another thing. The game doesn't have an autosave feature and I feel that if it's going to crash like this often, it probably should have one. To sum it all up...It looks cool and all, but holy hell, it just sucks up so much memory, your computer can't handle it and ends up halting it's processing on it all together automatically. So if you don't have a good computer, a REALLY GOOD COMPUTER, with LOTS of memory, then this game isn't for you. It's a shame... I was so excited about this game too. I love the RCT games and have been waiting for this one for years, only to see that it's in no way, shape, or form, ready to be played at all. And judging by what's being discussed by the devs, it's not going to be enjoyable in the years to come. =/			"

								This is early access release, most negative reviews complaining about bad performance and glitches. It need to be taken into consideration. Shame on all of you posting early access game reviews like you post your facebook comments. Get it together, because the game is very good.

								Way to buggy to enjoy.  The people in the park look like hell, bug eyed and stiff.  Park music get old really really fast.  graphics are not that great for 2016.  Lots of hard edges in the models.  Camera movement is not that intuitive but easy once you get used to it.  Very limited in the management options.  Yes, it does say early release, but if this is what is to be expected save your $50.			"

I'd be glad to support this nostalgic franchise although its original creators are no longer apart of the team and are off making a better game.It's not worth the current asking price. Atari deservers this rating. Should be very negative. Or, just ""Pure♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. Yeah, that should be a rating.			"

I hope you get everything worked out for the release. Did Atari even try to play thier own beta? I certainly wonder if they are having the same problems as us. Please take your time to get it right. We'll be waiting. This beta is a step in the wrong dircetion. From what I could get out of it before the crashing was not great. Can't build or bank a coaster without it saying ""its too steep"". I've spent maybe 10 hours trying to experence the beta. I typically get 5 to 20 mins into it before it crashes.  I wonder how Planet Coaster is doing?

								I only recently picked up this game after waiting for a good amount of updates after its original flop last year. I think it is coming along nicely. My favorite is the duel coaster creation tools (grid and freeform). It makes it easy to setup a coaster and fix the stuff that is not working really easy. I know the theme hub needs some work. Still needs more non coaster rides and coaster styles. Looking forward to what is to come. I do feel I will like it once its really released.  About 7/10 now.			"

								Ok, after reading the countless horrible reviews for this game on launch, I went against my better judgement and decided to jump out on a limb to try this game out. Wow. I am glad I did. If I followed those reviews about how this game is utter trash and should be scrapped than I would\'ve missed out on the franchises latest addition which, in my humble opinion, is pretty good so far. The game is definitley still in early access and you are liable to experience the occasional bug or two but this is ntohing compared to what I have read about the game being a buggy mess. More than likely, since I have picked this up at a later build, the game seems to run and play better for me than the folks who preordered. So far I am liking the game.

								Just stop it with the bad reviews, get off your high horses and realize what this game is.  Most of the people that are freaking out about it and saying how terrible it is are just not paitent enough to put a little time into and figure out how it works.  Also it's a simulation game for theme parks, not Medal of Honor.  It's a game who's target audience is much younger then most of those playing it right now.  People playing it right now are people that have been playing RCT3 for 10 years, know it backward and forward and were dealing with a game that has three updates.  This is not that yet and if that's what you're looking for then go back to playing RCT3 and stop trying to kill a game that shows a lot of promise, just give it a little time.  Last point, to the people complaining that you are basicallly paying to test ouf a game welcome to reality.  Why should a company pay someone to do it when they can get people to pay them to... duh.  If you don't like it don't do it but stop complaining about it.  This game is much better then it is getting credit for and I believe that in time it will be truly great.			"

												The coasters are really hard to build, since they derail all the time! Please adjust this, so that we can build crazier coasters with less limitations. If possible, create a system to desable physics completely! It would be so much fun to create coasters with this amazing new tool and actually be able to ride them without crashing. One more thing: I hope we actually get the option to activate smooth edges, since the game looks really weird without them. This game looks promising.			"

Early Access Review
								I own Planet Coaster, Parkitect, and this.  Of the three, this is the more ""complete"" game, but that's using the word ""complete"" very loose.   Planet Coaster is a beautiful and easy to learn game. It is like using a lego set to construct whatever your imagination can allow you to,  but it is very early in Alpha and just consists of a sandbox mode. It's fun for what it is, but it's far from complete and has zero business management at this time. That said, I expect Planet Coaster to be the best of the three when everything is said and done.  Parkitect is also very early in release and, like Planet Coaster, is just a Sandbox mode. It's a nice indie title that is wonderful considering only a few people are developing it.  It also has promise but is too early in development to really make a strong decision either way.   Like Planet Coaster, absolutely zero business management in it at this time. This game...there's lots to be frustrated with, but also alot to have fun with as well.  I think this game has a place with both Planet Coaster and Parkitect, but it needs a ton of TLC and polish to really compete with Planet Coaster down the road.   I like some aspects about this game, but only because I was looking for something to scratch the business management itch of a theme park.   This is the only one out right now that touches on that aspect.  And I use the word ""touches"" loosely as well. I do recommend this only if your expectations are that you will be getting a game that is in early access. There is plenty that works with this game, but plenty that is broken.   If you can accept this than it's worth consideration.  Truthfully i think this game is worth more like $19.99 at this stage, but if you don't mind paying what they are asking and have a metric ton of patience, then this might be up your alley.			"

												Im not sure why steam allows people to review the game in beta.  Upon downloading this game I did have some difficulties getting it to start (This should be fixed by the release) and there are some lag issues.  I believe the lag issues are because of the preset graphics settings for the game during beta.  People are getting all upset about little problem like these that may easily be fixed by an options menu.  It took me about an hour or two to get used to the controls, and before that this game was frustrating and unappealing to me.  After I mastered the controls of this beta the game became much more enjoyable and appealing.  Having played all three of the previous games this one deffinetely seems like it could be a step up in the future.  Many people are rating this entire game off of the first betas seeminly confusing rollercoaster builder.  I gaurentee you a good portion of the negative reviews are people who just cant move there mouse correctly.  After playing this game for 4 hours and recording 3 videos, here is my pros and cons chart.Pros: -Great vertex system of building the tracks.-New path system is great despite the fact that being symetric is nearly impossible.-Graphics are a huge step up from rollercoaster tycoon 3-Interface-New rollercoaster testing results guiCons: -No options in the first beta (really... this would have fixed a lot of people's problems)-No tutorial-No way to change or learn controls-Overly shaky when riding some rollercoaster (tends to make my head hurt)-Peeps sometimes just stop going on your rides (understandable con since the peeps are not finished yet)-Coaster Building was the main aspect of this beta, so all of the coaster settings should be available.Overall, this game is great to play and despite very little being available this beta I have yet to run out of things to do.

												It breaks my heart to see a game that was loved by so many for years come to this. I anticapated this release. I supported this release. I posted suggestions for improvements early in the alpha in hopes that this would be a game that redefined a genre. It appears that Atari put earplugs and blinders on and said, how can we make this un playable for a serious tycoonophyl. Some of the early requests I remember were simple ones. In fact, the one I remeber seeing most was just auto tunnel the stupid coasters, which is still not an option, and no matter how hard you try, you can't bring the ground up and over any track or path. I am utterly dissapointed in the end result and don't see any hope for improvement. If I could get a refund I would, but alas, I preordered and alpha'd. It's a horrible game in its current form. They shattered my hopes of an awesome addition to the series so profoundly that it may have cured me of preordering anything (I did alpha Planet Coaster and it turned out awesome). So cudos to Atari for ruining, for me, what was my favorite sim series of all time. They are the people who killed Kenny. (you know what goes here)............. Don't waste your cash. Buy Planet Coaster......			"

												I am quite dissapointed with this product. While the game in itself is great and fun to play, the program is buggy and unstable.For instance : a save game will not load, causing the game to crash or the game gets stuck on loading screen and entering the game world is impossible. More rencently, the game wont event start as it crashes even before the menus.I would also like to point out that the music is not impressive, we are a farcry from RCT 3's ""Summer air"".However, the Coaster editor tools are powerful, intuitive and really fun to use.This game is so buggy, I will definitely try Planet Coaster to see if the grass is indeed greener on the other side.

												You know, being a long time RollerCoaster Tycoon fan, this one hurt me. I started playing RCT when it first came out 17 years ago. I have been anxiously waiting for a follow up to 3 for a long time. After the first rocky reveal trailer for RCTW, the writing should have been on the wall. But they gave the reigns to a new developer and swore it would be better.Coming off of some 40 odd hours of Planet Coaster, this game looks, and plays like a joke.The style and the impression of the game that I got from playing makes it FEEL like an updated version of Bullfrog's Theme Park. The style is bland, the animations are hilariously bad, the tutorial is heavy handed.. It's just terrible. Coaster design is convoluted and messy, rides aren't fun to ride.The biggest joke is on me, for buying into the hype and the hope and purchasing the game through their website over a year ago, thus being ineligible for a refund through Steam or otherwise.Don't preorder games, and don't buy this one. Planet Coaster is the game you are looking for.			"

I kept giving it a chance since it came into Early Access (which was nothing more than a way to cash in during the delayed release.As a fellow developer I can understand how hard they've worked to live up to the hype in such a short amount of time, the problem is with Atari. I can't help but feel sorry for Nvizzio, but it will no doubt be the developers that take blame.As with all other reviews, the true follow up to the RCT series comes from the developers of RCT3.RCTW is Top Gear with Chris Evans, Planet Coaster is The Grand Tour.

								This feels like a completely different kind of game to me, and it's not worthy of being part of the Roller Coaster Tycoon Series. Relative Lack of Rides to choose from, Extreme lack of any music to add to your rides, All the music is boring, You cannot decide where to place ride entrances and exits, Roller Coaster Stations are fixed to a certain size and look, and the rides default names have been given stupid names instead of their actual names, for example: The Gravitron is now called Gravity Flux, and the Motion Simulator is now ""Space Wars"".Nvizzio Creations claimed to bring the fans something fun and something every Roller Coaster Tycoon fan would love, They Have FAILED, I am not impressed with this 4th Installment at all.Roller Coaster Tycoon World is very alienating to anyone who's much more familiar with the first 3 PC installments because it feels like a completely different kind of theme park simulator than what i expected out of the Roller Coaster Tycoon series. I am serious when i say this: Stick with the first 3 Installments, Roller Coaster Tycoon World became very boring very fast and very alienating to me as a fan of the Roller Coaster Tycoon Series. It is not worthy of being part of the Roller Coaster Tycoon Series.			"

The graphics look terrible and the peeps move like robots.Get planet coaster or parkitect.This game isn't even fully optimised whilst parkitect has some bugs but not that many compared to this game.Planet coaster has little to no bugs.The coaster builder is powerful but is slippery and finicky and the terrain tool is average.Infogrames is Ataris re animated corpse that makes bad cash grab games that ruin great franchises			"

												I wanted to like this game, really I did. I've been a fan of the RCT series since the 1st one, and I spent god knows HOW many hours playing RCT3. Rollercoaster Tycoon World was showing some promise when they release the first beta. It had lots of problems, but the devs were SO open to the community's feedback and input. However, I think this project just got too large for them--either that or this game became the perfect example of what happens when you try to please everyone. What's left is a game with far less options for creativity than any previous RCT game. Their coaster creator is promising but suffers from some awkward UI issues. And despite having some nice visual elements (I do like many of the coaster aesthetics), there are many laughable or groan-inducing design elements as well (let's pretend those park guests were never made). While Nvizzio no doubt did their best, this project got the best of them and fell flat on its face. If you're a fan of the previous RCT games, this one will definitely disappoint you and send you back to the old entries in the series or, more likely, head to that ""other"" roller coaster/theme park sim that just came out.

												Bought this game thinking I could recapture the fun I recieved playing the orginal RCT, I was wrong. Frustrations arised just from laying out pathways. The environment graphics is alright, I'd give it a 7/10, but my god if you zoom out and looks at the peeps, they literally skip around. RCTW really feels like a step backwards from RCT3. If I did not put in 30+ hours into this game I would have asked for a refund. A great alternative to RCTW would be Planet Coaster. I am hoping RCTW does get better but at it's current state, it is not worth the money. I love how they are going out of ""early access"" a day before Planet Coaster goes live.			"

Dere har gjort det nye spillet alt for vanskelig! Masse Bugs og drit! angrer alt jeg har for at jeg kjøpte det nye! Forlanger en oppdatering.			"

								One word to sum this game up ""Terrible"" why? You may ask. Well graphics are bad, glitches, and bugs. Yes I know ""why did you then buy it when it was early access."" To this I don't really have a comeback apart from when I pre-ordered it wasn't in early access and was supposed to of been the final product. But the developers are now releasing this as an early access game, is it because it's too crappy to sell as it is? Stay away from this don't get ripped off.			"

								I can't say I'm hating it.. and I understand it's in early access for a reason. The AI could be better, and the forced tutorial in the campaign is what started to turn me off of this game. It really isn't complicated enough to force something like that. I see where the developers are going, and how they plan to make that leap, but for now it feels like city skylines with rollercoasters. I'll play for a bit longer, and I don't expect rollercoaster tycoon 2 to make a come-back, but the gist of the matter is overcomplication for little pay-off.			"

												So now that I've seen the game in its full release, I must confess it's hardly any different from the beta. It's still quite crap.The good things I can comment on are the graphics. Graphics are very nice. When you test a rollercoaster it shows where on the track the speed, excitement, and everything changes and I have a feeling most of the work of this game went into the rollercoaster physics. This is where the good ends and the trouble begins.I'll start off lightly, the animations are still a little derpy on the guests. The mascots can look a bit creepy. But then let's get into more detail. There is almost no customization unless you use the steam workshop, but even then, there's just very little you can do with the rides, stalls, and staff. UI for the whole thing is a bit complicated and a steep learning curve. Things are a bit difficult to place as well and building paths is really crummy. You can't even have compact queue paths or curved queue paths. Guests seem a bit difficult to please as well. The waterphysics are bad, too. It's like a goop rather than water. The edges of the water aren't flat, they're round as if you've placed a very thick slime. Even the lake in the default forest map is overflowing and rounded out.There's just very little to do with the game and it feels very lacking. A few years of development and we get what feels more like a demo rather than a full release. Don't bother with this, go buy planet coaster if you want a good 3D park game.			"

Early Access Review
								I honestly hoped this game would be any good, but sadly I cannot for the life of me recommend this game to anyone or their dog.I have had the opportunity to play the game when it was in Beta in November 2015, since I pre-ordered, and honestly, it seems like they have not done anything to improve the game. Surely they made the coasterbuilder a bit better, but rollercoaster tycoon is not ONLY about building coasters. It is about managing your park, and you are are not able to manage it properly.- The game offers a variety of screens that allow you to look at how, and where, you are and aren't making money, but you do not have the control like in previous RCT games.- The game tells you when a ride has been waiting for a long time on a mechanic to fix it when it is broken, but there is no way to find a mechanic. the only thing you can do is build an extra stall and pray that that resolves it somehow. A management game should be about managing your employees, whom seem to be INVISIBLE. How can you manage that?I could go on about this all day, how bad the game performs, lacking BASIC features, misalignment in the User Interface and completely unnecessary differences in ride menus for every single ride, very ugly looking character models, very ugly looking rides, etc. etc.Basically, just don't buy this game, buy one of it's competitors. They are much better.			"

Put it this way, the team that developed the original RCT games is the team that went on to develop Planet Coaster. The team(s) that developed this game... Well - there were a few and none of them seem to know what they were doing. My biggest gripe overall for this game is with the visual aesthetics. The choices they've made for the ""peeps"" in the game are just horrible. The people that visit your park might as well be serial killers - they all have this wide eyed gaze on their faces. The lack of visual changes allowed for the buildings is horrible too. Every park pretty much winds up looking the same.			"

Early Access Review
								10/31/2015: (Closed ""Beta"",  DON'T LIE,♥♥♥♥♥♥IS A PRE-ALPHA)So, originally I had a really bad taste in my mouth after 9 hrs of gameplay and putting up with difficult coaster editor and items not locking to the grid.  This led me to give a negative review.  The thing I didnt realize was that if i looked past the bugs in the editor, like the twisting of the track, the support columns being placed in irritating places causing the coaster to run into them, or items not lining up with the grid, the editor was, in fact, the most powerful piece of software I have seen in a coaster game (RCT 1/2/3, No Limits 2, etc. etc.)  I took the time today to really attempt to figure out how the software was to work for me instead of fighting it.  After 2 hrs today, I have finally figured it out and have build a coaster that was IMO, free drawn.  After testing the coaster, you see where sh*t crashes and a few of the bugs causing this (pillars) but this is the point.   It is a process of perfecting your design.  Build, test, tweak, build, test, tweak.  The ability to allow such freehand movement has ""in a way"" made me feel as though i was using a design software such as AutoCAD.  Yes, this beta is bare bones and there are hardly any features unlocked, but they are breaking the game down into the bare-bones in order to ask the communitry what we like or do not like.  Imagine if they released a beta with all the bells and whistles.  You would not notice very minute problems in the 3 days they test for.  Yes, the editor takes time.  You almost have to train yourself (which in a video game, is not what I look for, for fun) but it does present a challenge, and challenges I like.  So, after refunded the game last night after being a little disappointed, I have decided to give it another go.  I'm glad I did.  These are not gamebreaking issues and I have absolute faith that these folks developing the game are striving to create one of the best.For those people who like to place ""premade"" coasters (which I also love to do when I'm not in the mood to build), there will be a slew of them according to the devs along with Steam Workshop support and mods.  Besides that, I believe there will be tons of content in free DLC and updates as the devs have promised.  There will also be the ""old"" track editor in the game like we are all used to in the old RCTs if you want to place tracks that way.  The point is, you don't HAVE to use the coaster editor but I want them to keep it, just fix it. Although, I judged the game on the beta, I have learned not to do this as it is not indicative of the final product.   But do not take my review as saying ""buy this game"" because I'm not saying that.  I am saying ""WAIT"" to buy this game or if you are easily frustrated, wait until the second beta.My hardware:Intel Core i7 2.5Ghz, 16 GB RAM, Nvidia Geforce 980M 4 GB VRAM, Windows 10Things that need fixing:Coaster editor bugs: Problems in auto pillar placement glitching thru the trackRandom twisting in the track while attempting to edit a mid track segmentMouse pointer/game desyncingWhen clicking on a node mid track, the track should not move until you apply whatever adjustments you are making (right now when clicking, the node will jump randomly of the screen and mess up what u have created""Live grid doesnt line up with piece you are trying to place sometimes.Not bugs but add this: No ""undo"" button, add edge of screen scrolling or right clicking on map to drag cameraDecorations:Items snap into areas you dont want them to go, once again, using freehand placement and grid (this is one of the issues that doesn't allow me to feel as though I have control over what I'm doing (which is premise of this whole game).  Example was, placed a path laid out according to the grid.  Attempted to place light posts, bushes, and benches.  They would line up on one side of the path, but on the other side, the bench or the posts would be off increasing my OCD.  I turned off the grid to attempt it freehand.  Same thing. So this needs fixingThe ability to ""change path color"" without deleting the path.  This is annoying.  It also defaults to the ugly red color even after you have been using the other paths so you place the path and realize, you have to delete and choose the right one and do it again.EDIT: Also add an ""upgrade function"" to either change the color of the path or upgrade size from small to large and vice-versa.Terrain Tools:Terrain works well.Althought the zoom feature to increase/decrease brush size is nice and natural, add a brush size setting as to allow people to have that ""option"".  Keywords in all of this is ""options"".  The more options to build, the better, and the more people will buy the game.Hope this has cleared things up.  Once again, the game IS based on the coaster editor but it will not be the ONLY building tool for coasters, but it will be there if you wanna use it, which i recommend (after being tweaked and fixed) in order to give you total freedom to build how you want.TL:DR:This is a ""beta"" more like an ""alpha"" but the game is stripped of the bells and whistles to address a select few items as to focus beta tester's attention to just those items in order to collect as much data and feedback to be able to fix the issues and give us as players what we want.My advice to potential buyers is to buy this game, LATER.  Just don't buy it NOW.  WAIT until the next beta  to see how the devs have progressed on addressing the above issues.  I have total faith these folks will fix the issues and bring us a great game but may require pushing back the release of the game if needed so this doesn't end up like SimCity.  I will give them a chance and after next beta, if the issues still remain, I will get a refund.UPDATE 03/30/2016: I have since upgraded my PC since writing the above review.  Specs are below:i5-6600K16GB RAMGTX 980TI Hybrid 6GBWindows 10 Pro 64 BitI get 144FPS with frame rate drops to 10 fps.  Crashes, bugs, etc.  The loading screen looks like a gay pride parade with rainbow colors flickering across the screen.  Then when the peeps enter the park they are jumping around like a bunch of idiots all frolicking and♥♥♥♥♥♥  It took me 2 hours to build a coaster and then the game crashed, losing all my progress.  FFSThere has been ZERO progress IMO as far as fixing what I stated above.  Honestly, I don't want to waste anymore time on reviewing this game.  Not really a game but more a job.  I feel like I should be getting paid to play this.  It's not even fun.I must've been smoking some good♥♥♥♥♥♥when I wrote the above review.  WTF have you people done for the last few months while pushing this back?  None of the above issues were fixed.  The grid is still garbage, the coaster builder is still trash.  Even after adding the manual track builder, that♥♥♥♥♥♥doesn't even work right.  I add a premade track piece and its all twisted up like a noodle.  It's like Ray Charles decided he was going to make a game, while driving, while giving other people directions on how to drive.  Give it up.  SHUT IT DOWN!!!! Everyone that buys this and cannot get a refund needs to open up a class action lawsuit.  Why?  Because it takes you 2 hrs to even get the coaster builder to work correctly.  I could build a five star condo in the time it takes for me to build 3 track pieces and most people will spend 2 hours doing that and cannot get a refund.  DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE, I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!  GET PLANET COASTER. TL:DR:  DON'T F**KING DO IT. DO NOT BUY THIS.  SHUT IT DOWN ATARI, SHUT IT DOWN NVIZZIO.  Good thing I only paid 18 bucks for this.			"

								Despite the many tweaks and bugs that need to be fixed, this is a good game.I instantly was thrown back to the old RCT 1 and 2 days. This is nowhere near as good as though, but this game is well on the way to be that great.The grid system needs to be overhauled. The center of the grid should line up with the entrance of the park. This way one person could create a perfect symmetrical park with the entrance. It always looks off center the way it is not. The grid should perfectly be centered to the park entrance and the edges of the map boundaries. The water and land modifier needs to be overhauled. Water is awful. They need to return to the old system from RCT 1 or 2. The water should just fill a pool instead of acting like a hose. Same with modifying land heights. It should be a click and hold feature. And the brush sizes should be larger and snap to the grid perfectly. Mine were all of square because the grid off square. These are a couple issues I have with the game that others haven't really mentioned. Most people just complain about bugs and optimization so I stayed away from that. The game has probably 30 rides you can use and a lot of food and souvenir booths. Peeps are still buggy, but I think it is still fun to play. Excited to see how this game shapes up in a year. Early Access Score: 6/10 Hopefully when this game releases I can give RTC World a better score.			"

								The good of a man is often buried with them, but the evil lives on afterwards...I've been an RCT fan since the very beginning, it was for a time my childhood, before the internet my brother and I would sit side by side on our computers (of which my mobile is now more powerful) and play Roller Coaster Tycoon. So forgive me in assuming having bought every Roller Coaster Tycoon game and their expansions over the years, for feeling a little disappointed and hard done by.Prior to buying and downloading, I watched youtube videos and whilst I liked the idea of planet coaster and the other rivals, I stood and was loyal to RCT and went and brought a copy.Yes, its early access and yes there is a hugh amount of work to be done, but it is not the same and never will be. Its full of amazing concepts and big ideas and on paper if I had $10,000,0000 I would support it or take the ideas and rebuild it myself. but I dont, but they do and they appear to have made a shambles of it.I log into steam every day to see if there is an update and I read the blogs with interest, hoping and praying that with each next release its fixed, but its becoming an embarassement to the RCT name. There is so much it could do and so much potential, so much that excites me about it... so much I want it to be... But it just isnt. I'm hoping that (if the developers dont see sense and fly me out to their offices immediately to help fix their mess) that within 6 months this game is fixed and actually playable. I've tried hard to have an open mind and to make this game playable but it just isnt. My advice if you are feeling thrifty this month is to take the money you would have spent on it and give it all to the next homeless person you see, or if you are not that way inclined, buy yourself and the homeless person a pizza with it, because quite frankly, the way it is right now, you'd both be miles better off in life than you would be if you owned this game.I'm not saying, don't buy it, you may think its great (if you've been living in a cave since 1999) but if you are expecting a game that is better than I could download for free on my phone, then currently you are looking in the wrong place.My conclusion you ask?  Is to wait a little and see what happens. I'll keep trying it and if it lives up to my expectations eventually I will recommend you buy it. For now? Stick your credit card back in your wallet, its not even worth the interest let alone the pennies...Thank god for steam, buying it on a DVD would be an insult to the plastic its burnt into!  "

								I have a really good computer, but the game still runs sluggily. The task manager show that RCTW does not even exhaust one CPU core. It's just slow seemingly without any reason.

												Absolutely do not buy this game. Atari owns the rights to the RollerCoaster Tycoon name, but that is all this game has in common with the previous RCT games. This is nothing but a cash grab from the ever-greedy Atari.The game is chock-full of bugs, bugs which have existed since the beginning of the Early Access period. There is practically zero support from Atari, they have completely disappeared after the game left Early Access. The graphics are awful, the peeps are laughable, the sounds are lazy, the path system is completely broken, the list goes on.If you take one thing away from this review, please  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, BUY PLANET COASTER! Planet Coaster is developed and published by Frontier Developments, the company that developed RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 and some of the RCT2 expansion packs. They truly have created the spiritual successor to RCT3. Do yourself a favor and check it out, it's what RCTW should have been.			"

								I gotta say.. if your building a simulation game, such as a theme park builder, can you guess what is most important?No, its not the rides, or the roller coasters. Its the AI... And RCT World's AI (or 'peeps' as you call them) are dumber than the first RCT.I mean come on.. we are in 2016 now, if you want to be the next big thing in theme park games, THE AI COMES FIRST. No matter what. At the moment, they are walking around like they all have constipation.. theres no interaction, no intelligence behind their behaviours.. just little ants walkin' around in circles. I do agree that you have done a good job with the structural design and the graphics are getting there.. but its the AI that makes me wanna demand a refund...........:SI hope to see great improvements from this game over 2016. Give it your best shot Nvizzio :)**EDIT**: This game DOES NOT WORK WELL with 4K!! That is why my peeps look constipated! Its best to update the game to suit 4k screens because at the moment NO SETTINGS for 4K LOOK GOOD?.............			"

								I waited months and months for this product. I purchased it as soon as it came to pre order, played the only alpha weekend (which there should\'ve been two) and hated it. I told myself it was the first alpha and not to worry. But when it was finally released as early access (what kind of game costs 60$ and goes to early access) I played for 3 hours then asked my for money back. Thank you Steam for returning my money to me because I would have been incredibly upset if I had gotten stuck with this game. It\'s nearly unplayable and with each new update I don\'t see the reviews getting any better. I\'m incredibly happy I found Planet Coaster and am now patiently waiting to play that upon full release (and that game has done an exclusive early access for gamers who pay a bit more, BUT the reviews have been phenominal for just the early access so I\'m ridiculously excited!)I was so upset with this game. Roller Coaster Tycoon was the first computer game I ever got into. And as this version stands now RCT 1 or 2 are better than this.			"

								Tried it, even with all the bad reviews. Sure enough, kept crashing.  Can't recommend something that doesn't work.  Got a refund.  Will attempt again if the bugs / crashes are fixed.  I did like the coaster designer, and would have enjoyed playing with it if I could without crashing.EDIT 04/13/2016.Found it on sale for 20 dollars so decided to retry after the patch.  I enjoyed playing with the roller coaster editor, however there is one big issue - you cannot build realistc coasters at the moment because the ride physics do not work - the cars do not slow down in a realistic fashion as they travel down the track. Just to see how bad it was, I built a straight track that just kept going back and forth and the coaster train took almost 10 minutes to finally stop moving.  As someone who wanted to use this mostly for the coaster designer, I still cannot recommend this as ride physics are just wrong. Hopefully this will be patched and I can try again.			"

Since launch there has been ZERO contact with the devs to fix issues, while Planet Coaster is active with the community, already releasing multiple patches after launch. If you are trying to decide, go with Planet Coaster, the true successor to Roller Coaster Tycoon			"

Early Access Review
								The path building mechanics are annoying compared to previous RCT games; rotating and raising is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ and overseeing employees seems to be an impossible task (my three mechanics wouldn't fix any rides, and I had a park full of broken rides and peeps floating around... whaaa!?)Despite the above, and the frustrations encountered thus far, I'm still giving this a thumbs up. There's a lot of potential for this game, and I do hope it keeps getting updated and improved. I haven't encountered any massive glitches thus far, though given the floating peeps and drop in FPS, I'm sure it's not far off. Again, despite this, heaps of potential for this game if they continue with improvements and at present, it's fairly enjoyable if you're a patient person.			"

												Unfortunately, this game is nowhere near finished. The graphics are good, the coaster cam is good and it's fun to build a park.BUT: on the managment side, everything is missing!For example: you can't get a sortable overview of all rides you have and see how popular they are, what their profits are etc. And in the overviews that ARE available, you can't click on the name of a ride to go to it.The data displayed in the profits-tab is completely useless to me: for example, a burger stall has an hourly profit of $2000, has been open for 2 years and has made a total profit of $2500 so far.And if you want to create a themed part of your park, for example Sci-fi, you have to go through all options (lights, benches, etc) since there are no filters. You can filter neither on type nor on theme. We already had these options in Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, but it's all missing now.All in all it's just not really a get at all, but more of a 3D modelling program. If that's what you're looking for, then this is for you. But if you also want a management game and make some sense of why you are or are not making any money, then you should not buy this game at all.			"

												I'm very sad this game didn't turn out so well. At least in Early Access the game was playable. At its current ""Released"" state its unplayable. There is so much lag and stuttering when trying to place any object or build anything in the game. It's odd how it wasn't like this before the official release of the game and now it's just awful. I really wish I could get a refund and get Planet Coaster.			"

								This game is just so unplayable, the mouse and keyboard controls are just so confusing, some of the controls you are unable to change them,  the controls are not simple as to how they are in RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 and other RollerCoaster Tycoon games, Another thing that I very much dislike is there inst a feature to change the different money currency,its just on one currency.  Over all the game has potential but its no where near to the standard of what people are paying the price for the game.  "

								This game offers everything players wanted that the previous versions did not have. Great graphics, great rides, good coaster builder, nice variety of scenery. This is only early access and the future still has a lot to offer. Most negative reviews are written by people who have no experience at all with the RCT sequels, true fans of the franchise know that this is the best version yet of that theme park game. You have full freedom to make your park the way you like, this is why I love the game and it deserves a total recommendation.			"

								This was a game I really loved as a kid & was one of my first loves, together with Zoo Tycoon & Age of Mythology. So you can guess my level of excitement when I spotted this game was in development, anticipating I would live up to the legacy left behind by its predecessors.Unfortunately after not even 5h in-game I decided to call it.It is nowhere near the level it should be, it’s very clunky, squeezes every inch out of my ultra-high end gaming PC and graphics are, by today’s standards, mediocre at best.However, there is potential in it and I will be sure to follow this up with another review in due time when the final version is released and much needed patches & bug fixes are applied.As the game is today, I would NOT recommend it but I would recommend to wait and see IF this becomes a game worth playing in 6 months or so.

								Calling RTCworld a Béta or Early acces is in my opinion too optimistic.I see this game in the state it is now as a pré-alpha version.That beeing said I truly hope that the developers keep pushing out updates that really make the game better, both technically and in content. At the moment the updates come in a descent pace, one better than the other, but they are at least working on it. Sadly the game needs very, very much work before it will be finished.At this moment I cannot recommend the game, but it has potential. I hope the devs take a look at the competition, and will be motivated to do even better, but they will need to rise the bar much higher to convince me and others. Otherwise this game is doomed to be left in my Library, doing nothing more than beeing a statistic in my gameslist. Bought the game, played it for a short while, but in its current state it simply is not up to the job of keeping me hooked like the first itterations of the game.Fingers crossed and hoping for the best!!!!

Early Access Review
								After playing this game some more and mysteriously having my key revoked without a refund, I have decided that this game is the biggest heap of♥♥♥♥♥♥to ever enter Steam since Rome 2 Total War.Growing up on RCT2 and RCT3 (yes, I am that young), which were both incredible games, my expectations for this game were extremely high.It was fraught with problems. At first I forgave them, because it was in Early Access.Let's start with the positives (of which there are few), though. We have to give this game a chance, right?Good things:-Snazzy new coaster builder-Snazzy new paths builder-I REALLY like the new restaurants which replace basic food stands-Cars in coaster trains can be different colours-The new water tool isn't efficient at all but it's top banterThat's it.Anyway, back to the negatives (of which there are many):Not only did I learn that this game was not made by the original developers, but I also noticed more and more things that are catastrophically wrong with this game. For a start, it's massively overpriced.Then you get into the rollercoaster ratings. I simply cannot get anywhere in the campaigns because rollercoasters are rated as high intensity WAYYYY too easily, and in order to make a 'coaster that is exciting at all, it needs to have pretty much ultra-extreme intensity... so nobody rides it and you just lost 20,000 monies, pal.You only have a small amount of music choices, and they are just variations of exactly the same tune in a depressingly low quality, which drives you bloody insane in five minutes.Sometimes when you place custom tracks using the snazzy new spline coaster builder, you cannot add another section because the new secton has to be a pre-built track. This is probably hard to understand, and we face a dilemma because in order to properly understand you need to play the game, but that is something you absolutely do not want to do.I thought I could deal with the supports problem but it is SO common that it is UNFORGIVEABLE. It is so infuriating to have a nice creation utterly ruined and the immersion completely shattered by a track support going through the middle of your loop.But BY FAR THE WORST PROBLEM is the optimisation. Having spent £960 on a computer, which I have to say is a very good one, you'd expect to get good performance on this game. Right?NOOOO!On the very lowest settings on a flat map with a couple of rollercoasters, my computer struggles to reach 20fps. On a map with varied terrain and many rollercoasters, I might as well be watching a slideshow.I will now proceed to wait impatiently for Planet Coaster, after learning that it was actually made by the developers of RCT3 and it's not just a cheap knockoff of the RCT series. You want to know what a cheap knockoff of the RCT series is?This game.			"

								This game is terrible... like really terrible. It looks NOTHING like the screenshots that were constantly being shared by the developers. The game's graphics are horrible even on the highest settings. Also, the frame rates drop a lot as well. I have a Geforce GTX 960 graphics card with an Intel i7 processor. This is the ONLY game I've played that has horrible graphics on my PC. I'm really disappointed. The anti-aliasing doesn't even work well. It's not even just the graphics either. The overall gameplay is terrible. Building rides is too complex. It's hard to build a decent roller coaster without coming across too many problems. The controls are too difficult. Also, you can't even change the color schemes of most rides.This is the first Roller Coaster Tycoon game that I've been upset about. The other three were fine the way they are. Even though RCT3 has its faults, it's still better than this game. Save your money! Do NOT buy this game until it becomes better (if that happens).I've been a life long fan of the Roller Coaster Tycoon franchise since I was a child! I've been playing since the game was released (1999). This one game has left me horribly disappointed. They ruined this once great franchise! :(			"

								What a stressful game to play.  It's way too much work to get the coasters to bend the way you want and the game environment is still not as immersive as it should be.  I played 11 hours of it and stopped because it was simply not enjoyable.  My posture is good but my body hurts from the stress of trying to work with some of the game tools.  Save your money for Planet Coaster.I hate to write this because I had very high hopes and was very optimistic, but the game is simply awful.  On top of that, even though I'd owned the game for a few months, I'd only had a chance to play it for 11 hours and Steam would not refund it because of their strict adherence to policy.  While I do understand that, the game sucks!  I paid a lot of money for it and feel that I did not (and will not) be getting anywhere near the value.			"

								So this game is getting my reccommendation because its quite obviously a work in progress. The developers seem genuinely interested in what the community has to say, and for that they get my recommendation.The issues I've noted with the game so far are for the most part already described, but for the uninformed, I'll go into them briefly.-Pathing and structure layout needs work-Peep and employee control needs work-Game starts to lag after large amounts of items are placed-The coaster design panel could use some smoothing over, I just have some issues with the way the controls are layed outAnd those are the most major issues seen in most reviews. Now for the fun part, what I truly like!-The game is absolutely gorgeous graphically, it was high time for an updated RCT and this game captures that spirit wonderfully. You can tell that although its a work in progress this is truly going to be a wonderfule heir to the series.-The theming, while in true RCT style can get slightly excessive, allows for a wonderful array of customibality (probably spelled that wrong, ah well). Everything from the music to the cues can be colored and placed, and they've added things like fake walls and beautiful plazas and centerpieces that allow you to create whole sections of thematically designed park. You can get lost for hours just placing correct pieces *just so*. I'd love to see more themed items soon.-The notification panel is handy. With smart phone like features it allows you to view park info and see both the good and bad fairly quickly. Not exactly a new thing, but definitely well updated, although it needs some work.-And overall the HUD layout seems fairly streamlined and definitely more modernized. It could use a bit of tweaking here and there, but its fairly easy to use which I suppose is a priority.Anyways, so that's a few of my opinions. Hopes this helps both the new and the old Tycoons in their buying/desicion making. "

In a couple of weeks, maybe months the game will be in more solid state but even playing it this early, to me has been worth the money. "

Early Access Review
								This game sucks!! It is terrible, the graphics suck, the controls are confusing, and the people just jump around when your zoomed out. This game is way beyond saving. People dont waste your money on this terrible game and go buy planet coaster it is way better and you'll have much more fun. Now, their are lots of reasons this game sucks. Here are a few. 1. When using the piece by piece track builder and you want to put in an inversion and you want to use one of the pre-made ivesions it will put them underground, What the heack!! Im trying to enjoy this piece of crap the best i can, but when i can't even build a roller coaster with loops then this game should not even be on the market. 2. The path system in this game is terrible! You can't connect the paths straight have the time, again how am I supposed to make a functioning theme park if i cant have good looking paths! 3. The game can't even hit 60FPS. I have a really good computer but i cant even hit 60FPS with this game.4. The camera controlls are terrible. What the heack is up with having q and e to rotate the camera. Why not just use the mouse. 4. The Roller coaster features are terrible. I know i already said stuff about theme but that wasn't even scratching the surface. The coaster cam sucks. It looks like some 6 year old kid made it. I have to click test go into coaster cam exit coaster cam hit test again just to start a test. The piece by piece for the coaster sucks too. It is difficult to use and very limited. 5. Everything looks awful. To the benches to the trees the graphics suck for all of it. Those are just some reasons you sould never buy this game. I don't recomend it. I hope this review helped you befor you wasted your money like me. Thanks atari			"

								I'm confused by all the negative reviews. I just bought the game and spent a few hours building a park and rollercoasters etc.. I'm enjoying the game. The camera is smooth and the placement is fairly good. I love the coaster builder in this. It's leaps and bounds above RCT3. I have no trouble linking my track to the station like I did in RCT3 sometimes.IT's not perfect it took me a few minutes to figure out the menu and camera controls. There's a lot missing but I think it will be in the final release. The fences are really bad and I hope theyll rethink those to be able to snap to the pathways or allow users to shape them like pathways. Speaking of pathways I'm not sure why you can't make cue lines curved but I would like to see that. other notable things that's missing are the transport rides which is the thing I like the most in RCT3. There needs to be more default rides and scenery but whats in the game is pretty solid so far. As far as the frame drop goes I did have a pretty big frame drop but the honest truth is I never noticed it until I looked at the fame counter. Right now I would recommend this over planet coaster if you can only afford one. The only reason I say that is because you can actually play this game now. The Steam vrsion of planet coaster hints to being able to play early if you buy the deluxe package but thats not so. I have watched videos on youtube about both of these games and RollerCoaster Tycoon World doesn't look as fleshed out as Planet Coaster but after playing it despite the negative reviews I'm quite happy with this game.

								All i wanted it to be..I was so worried that this game would suck because of all the bad reviews i had a friend gift it to me...loaded up fine....Its rollerCoaster Tycoon 4....THIS IS WHAT WE WANTED...i am stoked (blown away) at the detail in the game. Yes it will lag out once you are up and running but for me only on fastest speed. Even at this stage in early access I'AM HAPPY WITH IT...i havnt notice anybugs but am also only 6 hours in...yes it needs some work in the back end and more rides and things. Also the deleting and forming need to be reworked they are not the best at the moment..hope this helps the second person that reads it (i read it first obvs) to buy the game coz even in early access its good.

								Despite the many negative reviews the game has potential. I like the 'action cams' that lets you ride each attraction in a 3D-view. In general, the graphic details should continue to improve (at least a bit) but the current detail level doesn't affect the gameplay to much.Different to many other players I haven't experienced problems in building tracks / paths but what's really (REALLY) annoying is the strange sound of the park-visitors. I guess they are zombies?I am missing more attractions.Good for a few hours of game-play and already worth the money if you got your Steam-code for that game on one of the usual portals for approx. half the price! Otherwise, wait until the finished version will be available.			"

								WOW! I mean, I do not understand what people are complaining about. EARLY ACCESS means just that it is in BETA really. Everything is not going to work as expected. But what dumb***es do not realize is they have a chance to help direct the way this game is developed before being FINAL Release. Look, I have been with RCT since 1996, YEAH 20 YEARS I have been waiting for an RCT which interacts this way. This game is enjoyable to play if meet the system requirements. And from what I have read at the developers web site, MOST people FAIL to meet the requirments for this game, yet they complain about performance of the game. The game is there and it has HUGE potential and it will get if you are patient enough to wait out the bumpy ride. It is getting smoother with every update. Blog #11, Update #8 at the time of this writing, and this game is very enjoyable as long as you meet the requirments. To be honest, my gaming PC doesn't have an i5, but I have a 3.2GHz Pentium and it gets rough sometimes, but that will soon clear up as soon as I get the i7 I am looking in to here before summer is over. Then my computer will really fly and game will be even more enjoyable as it is meant to be!			"

												We I first booted the game, I thought I would play the first campaign to get grips with the game, I thought I would bulid a basic park with a few rides.  Surely what could go wrong. Disapearing paths and missing track partk, add a few staff and away you go.Piles of Sick and broken rides and people not using the toilets. Create a Pre Bulid Coaster its got a extreme nausea rating, So the staff do sweet f all, and we can't even pick them up or see them. Why include stuff which is clearly broken, rather than enabling us to bulid a basic park and add features when neccessary rather including the out of the box.Yes it may turn out to a decent title, but I would'nt reccomend it at the moment, Played Planet Coaster a week after first playing this early access and was just blown away by the dfifference in quality, I have'nt even tried coaster buliding yet (I am waiting). I am looking forward to Parkitect as well, and I am prepared to suport Kickstarter/EA so I know whether a game has got  potential or not. I played it again to give further opinion and although it has improved , I just can see this hitting there mark, but I could be wrong.			"

								OMFG A REVIEW THAT IS RECOMMENDING THIS GAME? WTF IS THIS BS!?!?!?!?!!Well i'll try to explain to you why I gave it a thumbs up.When the early acces launched I was SUPER hyped for this game. After 20 minuts of playing I was almost crying and thinking about how i could've spend my money on food and have alot more fun.BUT......after the first big update they released I stopped sobbing and played the game again. And you'll never guess, I actually enjoyed playing the game! the graphics improved, lagg was (for me) almost gone no matter what I did in the game ( at first I was lagging with just about anything. Coasterbuilding, paths, scenery etc.)Now... I'm going to be really honest with you if you're thinking about buying the game. In my opinion you shouldn't buy it..... YET! Simply because the game just isn't ready yet and you'll probably be dissapointed just like I was. What I can recommend you guys is hanging on to your money a little bit longer just to see what the next updates are going to bring to the game. And i guarantee, if the updates are going to be as good as the first one, this game will be a true RCT that will bring you hours of fun gameplay!And if RCTW isn't going to get better for you even after the updates, I'm really sorry for you spending your time reading this and you should just pre-order planet coaster instead. LMAO LOL.			"

												As of right now I can't recommend this game. I know it is only a beta, but with less than 6 weeks to go until the initial release, it is clear to see that this game is going to need a lot of polishing, so much polishing in fact, that I think that the devs are not going to be able to put a well working game together, by the time this game does launch. This is a real shame, because I had really high hopes for this game and have been waiting on it for quite some time.I had hoped everything would have worked the way I wanted it to work, but unfortunately it diddn't.The coaster editor and builder are very complicated, it even takes a highly experienced RCT player and modder like me, a hell of a lot of time to get used to (let alone build a good working coaster), the cars constantly bump into an invisible wall at the end of the station, making them fall off, or hit some kind of bump on the lift hill and fall through the track. Also when the cars fall through (and sometimes into) the track, it is impossible to despawn them, making it impossible to go further with your coaster and you might as well delete it as you can't do anything about it. The snap to grid function is basically non-existent, the grid does not allign properly and this makes it nearly impossible to build straight tracks and paths.I personally don't think they should have called this a Beta, it can't even be called an Alpha at this stage (in my eyes)There is still so much work that has to go into this game, that I personally think that the devs and designers should push back the release to give everything a good look over and some polishing. I still think there is potential in this game though, I hope Atari and NVizzio will iron out all mistakes and listen to what their customers have to say and want, otherwise I think I will back away from this game and get the Opponent's game.

								If you like the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, this is a nice addition.  However, keep in mind that it's early access so expect bugs.  But if you're eager to check it out, it plays good mostly.  Sometimes I'll have all the peeps in the park freeze and walk in place.  Or coasters that are not broken down will not launch when people board them. (this happened with both my coaster and a pre-built) But, all in all, it's pretty cool and I'm looking forward to the updates to see how this game progresses			"

								Oh my god. Wow. What an absolute atrocity of a game.Parks are only big enough to contain one rollercoaster, which are a NIGHTMARE to try and build (They put in a new little piece-by-piece coaster editor since the beta for when the other editor gets on your nerves too much but honestly that may be the only thing about this game that doesn't make me want to rip my hair out, and even IT was put in as an alternative to a feature which evidently even the programmers realized was hugely flawed).I play a game called Nolimits Coaster, which is a realistic simulator that real world coaster companies use to simulate how their rollercoasters are going to end up looking, and even it is easier to build a rollercoaster in than this game, and the coasters here don't come CLOSE to realistic (and even when I tried to aim for realism, it still said my rides are too intense for some reason, if they didn't just flat out fly off the track)Even putting aside rollercoaster building as a whole due to how terrible they are (despite them arguably being the entire POINT of the Rollercoaster Tycoon series) the game is awful. The flat rides look ""whimsical"" and pre-themed, which might not bother people who aren't big on theming their own park or having a park that looks realistic, but for coaster nerds like me it's a huge turn-off.The tutorial sort of cut out halfway through, and basically, I stopped playing after an hour and a half so I can immediatly demand my money back and preorder Planet Coaster (A game made by the people who made RCT3, who's ALPHA is currently looking way better than this thing).I get that MAYBE a part of them was trying to set things straight and give fans the game they wanted, but they ran out of time before they got the chance, but... Man, this is a really bad game. Really bad. They didn't listen to the fans enough, they kept stuff secret for too long, and tried to fix it when they didn't have enough time to. The result is a buggy, hard to play game with missing features.It left me feeling angry and wondering where I put my Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 CD.I would honestly not be surprised to see that the studio ends up closing after a huge flop such as this. This is a dud the size of which I've seen lead to game or movie studios going bankrupt in the past.			"

												So what is there to say about RCTW, right now the game is in early access and I cannot at this moment recommend the game, there are to many bugs, to many things that plain dont work and seems to be too much reliance on UGC. The problem is and its the biggest problem this game has to face it is widely hated there are more people playing RCT3 than this, this means less people making ugc and less people there to entice Atari/Nvizzio to continue supporting the game.If I really had to put a value on the game I'd say $10 - $15 so if you can pick it up in a sale for that amount I recommend you do. As I have said this is in early access with the promise of it being finished incl. Peice by peice builder, water rides, transport rides, etc..I will continue to update this review as long as Atari keep updating the game and if they achieve all their promises this will surely be a game I recommend. Just not yet.Update 11 Nov 16:So has the game got any better? its been 6 months you'd hope so right, well it has got marginally better but its still a terrible game, the community has gone. Piece by Piece has finally come out and it isn't all that bad but compared to competitors its way off the mark.I must say I change my previous not recommended review to seriously not recommended, even if you can find it for $15-$20 don't bother save your money. This game is talking about leaving early access and it is soooo far from being anywhere near being finished. Most people cannot even play the game it's so broken.Do not buy right now, it is broken, wait for a few more months and see what happens (it'll also be cheaper ;))Update for Final Release:So the game has finally been released, is it worth it quite simply no. Nvizzio has worked very hard, theres a new story mode, it can be quite boring at times and the missions dont have much creativity. There are still a lot of bugs, the AI is still the worst thing about the game as in it does not work at all.The peeps and ride animations have been improved but still needs work to be done to make them what I would call good. There are promised of more content and patches post release so like I have said since the beginning, it is not worth it yet wait until more content and fixes. I will update when said fixes arrive.Do not recommend			"

								Everyone in my park disappeared and then I got 500 people rushing through the entrance. Now i'm rich.Serious review:This game doesn't deserve all of the hate it recieves. It's not a bad game, it's enjoyable but not perfect.Pros:- Better rollercoaster creator than RCT3- Menus are simple and easy to navigate- EnjoyableCons:- Poorly optimised- Graphics are quite bad. This may be a pro eventually as in the latest update they improved the graphics.- Limited customization options.- Crashes often - If you buy this, save your park every 5-10 minutes so you don't lose your progress.- The price is too high for an early access game.- Bugs. Bugs everywhere. So far i've come across at least 15 bugs. Some are amazing, some are terrible. Here's a few bugs i've come across so far.. Mechanics ignore my broken rides.. Everyone in the park disappearing and then re-entering the park.. Can't disable ""heat maps"".. People get stuck in the floor. This happened to my mechanic, a few of my janitors and even some of the ""peeps"".Yes, Planet Coaster IS better than this game. Yes, it will likely always be better than this game. BUT, this is still a great game despite the bugs and the terrible optimisation. It may not have a lot of the features Planet Coaster has but that doesn't make it unenjoyable. In my opinion, this is an alright game for people that want a Rollercoaster themed game right now but can't afford £50 to play Planet Coaster early. But then again, Rollercoaster tycoon 3 is a cheaper option for a rollercoaster themed game and honestly, it has more features and better graphics than this.EDIT: it seems that people who hate the game are downvoting almost every positive review.

Not sure how you can judge on a beta. I just had great fun messing about with a rollercoaster so preposterous that I will never be allowed to work in the tourism industry.Be aware that making a rollercoaster involves a degree of sense, and possibly knowledge about physics. I have neither, resulting in a (literal) pile of broken carriages that amused me no end.If actually playing the game is what you want, now is not the time. I shall add to this review when that time comes...meanwhile, enjoy the thrill ride that is Death Lake Coaster Hell.			"

								Updated for EA release.Game is all good but there are a few issues that should be sorted by the time it is fully complete don't be fooled by the crazy amount of negative feedback its getting, some are genuine and some are abit longed out getting an unfinished product after waiting so long but a huge amount is just people comparing and bashing it because of PC.Pros --Coaster builder is really cool and much more stable compared to the beta. It does take some getting used to but once you've mastered 1-4 the creations you come out with look epic.-Tycoon elements are kind of there setting the price for rides and entry is key to staying on top and not going into debt.-Map looks great and they are really fun to build on. The devs have already said a flat map mode will be added but I'm pretty happy with the 3 already here.-Decor also really cool will be good once there is alot more but whats here looks sweet and it can really make your park look cool.-Other rides the time and attention put in is noticable they look really good especially compared to RCT3.-UI, I get loads of people don't like it but I've not had any issues other than one thing but I'll put it in the cons it was by no means a deal breaker though. -Build a massive coaster and pay after is a really good move can really help push time along just building some beast and not having to pay for the completed ride until you wish to open it. Was always long running out of money back in RCT2,3.Cons--Alot is missing, some might feel ripped off paying so much for what you get and how unstable it can be at times.-Glitchy I've had peeps all spawn by the entrance after loading. I've had my money drop at 10,000 a second after the heat tab bugged out, not sure if this is a bug but cant seem to build anything beyond zero depth if I put a coaster drop at -1 depth it will always crash.-Unstable only at times I would build a few coasters and Ill start to get major slow down it goes back to normal speed after a while but it does remind you your playing a early access game.-Some plants vanish from view if you go more than 1 foot away from them it might sound silly to some but after spending a few hours making some sick flower display it can really grind your gears that its all invisible when zoomed the slightest bit out!-UI only issues I have is with the heat panel it makes me go minus in money other than this one thing its all good.-Peeps getting bored of rides it sounds like a really good idea to put this in but it just ends up making sure you will always fail. After 9 years in game time no one other than the odd one or two peeps would ride anything in the first 3 zones of my map they desperately need to add a scenario maker and add the option to restrict what % peeps will get bored at so they never fully find any ride boring.-Lack of management for any in park services. This is something they said they will be working on but it is something that needs to be sorted asap not one of my 100+ mechanics would fix the circus and there is no way to find them or set them to do a task or even give them a radius in which to patrol. I'm not feeling just put down a building and hope they are working, it does not work. -No colour change tab for any of the pre build family, junior and thrill rides they look good but dont see why this isnt just a normal feature.-Long load times its not a deal breaker for me but in this day and age any long loading screen is a con.Things that need to be added please - -Smaller rollercoaster entrances. -More decor, rides and shops.-Being able to build rides through mountains and at minus depth and maybe tunnels in water?-Camera to take peeps pictures on rides was surprised this wasn't in the build panel.-Scenario maker just like the one RCT3 had would be sweet.-Staff tab and general commands just like the previous game would work fine.-Balloons that float off and the ability to pop the kids ones to ruin there day.-Water rides, gokart rides, zoo stuff and water world stuff im sure it'll all come but want to be able to build an epic gokart track again soon.-More music and themes.-Option added to sandbox mode to set starting money if the scenario maker takes too long to come.- Map grid mode improvements. Just put the grid over the whole map and let it change size as it does now just over the whole map. Its not bad how it is but it can be off putting at times all moving about.Overall It's a really fun game as is but I will look forward to all the updates, it might have awful reviews but dont be put off by them. It will freeze on occasion and it is a little glitchy but so are loads of EA games. People need to be more patient and stop bashing it and filling the forums up with comparison discussions. I'm sure PC is a great early alpha too but the only thing RCTW have done diffrent is put it on steam in EA instead of releasing through there site. I've already had a load of fun with what's here and I can see myself playing this for days on end. 7/10 - based off of EA quality and features-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Original beta review)The beta is a frustrating experience for anyone who loves the originals. Its completely different to what where use to and building a coaster can seem like more of a crazy hard mission than fun I was going in thinking it would be RCT3 with better graphics, controller support and the tools to finally be able to build diagonal with my paths and all over the place with my rails but its not!You can do all this but it feels odd and hard and nothing like RCT3 but this is why its going to be so great. I only played for a tiny amount of time but now I see how fresh this is and what it could possibly be on launch. I never remembered playing RCT2 and smashing it first park and when I got around to smashing RCT3 I thought the 3D jump was unneeded and looked messy but after a few hours you get sucked in and all becomes well and good and after plating this dodgy beta Im sure it'll have that same effect. I have faith in Atari and the other teams behind this, I may not of been as buzzed playing the beta as I thought I was going to be but Im now more hyped for that finished product. Looking forward to learning how everything works and building my own park with all these changes to an already great franchise.Pros in beta - - Everything was different to what I assumed it was going to be like.- Looks pretty. - Coaster freeform although hard was fun.- Decor looked crisp - That Atari provided a beta.Changes if not already in the pipeline -- Day and night cycle far to fast please get the balance RCT3 had. - Camera seemed over wonky in the coaster builder mode half the time my mouse was off screen and I couldn't see clearly where to place my coaster because I had to be zoomed so far out. (Im sure this is just a beta issue)- Map size seemed small because the coasters have to be so huge to work, hope this was just a beta map size and not all where getting.- Controller support seemed useless I gave up after 10mins just remove it.- More coaster stats, would be cool to see speed and g-force while placing rail.- better UI and sort something out about holding SHIFT and scrolling to change rail tilt and height, It felt annoying and would just change the camera height half the time. Just let it be a 1 click process like click the height rail button now scroll to change height then click to place and click the change height button again to go back to just normal rail placement. (Maybe my keyboard was giving me the run about on this one but either way the 1 click process should be a thing)Overall will look forward to playing the next beta but more importantly I cant wait to be playing the full game and losing days to the graft of building the mega coaster.

								Growing up with the rollercoaster tycoon franchise is really why I bought this game and honestly I am not disappointed , I played those games with every crash or bug and freeze and loved them none the less. If I could suggest a few things to the development crew though , please add the ability to twist track after it has been placed also it would be nice to have auto que lines, and auto save because I have almost lost my coaster that took two hours to make to a game freeze.  The most problematic part of the game really is optimization but it is still thoroughly enjoyable.  6.8/10			"

												Although RollerCoaster Tycoon is one of my favorite game franchies, this latest incarnation has me worried. I'm unimpressed with the pre-order Beta weekend. The game seems far from finished (although due to be released in a little over a month),The game ran very slowly on my machine (8gb ram), though I was one of the fortunate ones that didn't have continuous crashing problems. The beta was limited to a very small portion of the game content and limited to two weekends of play between now and release. Overall the user interface felt laggy and clunky. The coaster builder was interesting but riddled with bugs and physics issues. Building a complete coaster that wasn't simply a lift, drop and circle back to the station was almost constantly met with incredible frustration. (And I'm not new to the genre, I still play RCT3 and building coasters is my favorite aspect of the game)I am quite surprised by this beta release. I expected a nearly completed game, a smooth and lag free engine and an exciting preview of what awaited the final release. Instead it was an unfnished  mess of problems that felt like a very limited alpha test. I have requested a refund and will wait to see what the reviews are like after the game releases in December before deciding to purchase or not.			"

I have been playing it on a I7/Nvidia 960 laptop and also on i7/Crossfire Ati system @ fullHD with all settings maxed on both systems.. no problem at all with proformace. laptop dips a little during night. but thats to be expected.The game it's self is coming along fantasticly. I have played all the RCT games. And this ups the bar. By far the best looking.. and the idea of staff services is great as is the coaster editior.There is alot of work left to do.. some features that you found in much older versions are not in this version yet. But thats the point of E/A. I dont feel that the game deserves a mostly negative rating.keep it up Nvizzio!			"

												Do not buy this game! its a scam!(This game has been nominated ""Scam game of the year"")Some bought this game before it came to steam and a few the very day it released as EA. We saw great footage and stable gameplay and was given lots of promises. But when we got the game it was something completely else and tbh it feels like its still the same game as it was in alpha.The game can't run properly if you have a few rides, coasters and over 200 peeps!! its that badly optimiced. To give you an idea about how awful that is, I can run Planet Coaster with 4000 peeps and tons of rides, coasters without lag at all.I think they used the money we spent on their mobile game instead

												I recommend passing over this game and instead buying Frontier's Planet Coaster. It's not the game we deserved, but the one we needed. So we'll buy it. Because Frontier can take our sales. Because they're not our hero. Frontier is a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A true sequel.This game does not live up to the RCT name. It would take at least twice as much development as it currently has to get anywhere close. If you're crazy about theme park simulation games, you might find some enjoyment from it, but let me go over the good and the bad.PROS:Not limited to a tile system like the previous titlesCoaster builder has piece by piece functionality, although limitedCONS:No piece by piece structure building like in previous titlesNo water rides, transport rides etcCoaster builder is extremely challenging to work with  --> It uses your camera's orientation and mouse position to orient new nodes  --> Clicking on a node moves it  --> Often tells you that smoother curves are impossible and forces bad track design  --> View of nodes is obstructed when adjustments are deemed illegal, making it hard to fix  --> No smoothing or straightening track functionality  --> Coasters don't slow down due to friction as much as you would expect  --> Coaster supports are unrealistic and don't reappear if removed  --> Brakes don't work properly, causing coasters to fail  --> Block brakes don't work properly, and multiple trains often cause coasters to stop working  --> Height limit is unrealistically low (80m)Coaster types  --> Missing kiddie coaster, wild mouse, corkscrew coaster, looping coaster  --> Spinning coaster spins irradically, causing high intensity ratings no matter how realistic  --> Launch coaster catapult is too short and launches to height limit (80m) at slowest settingPeeps are not properly implemented  --> An unrealistic number of peeps visit your park (300+ with just a carousel)  --> Zooming out causes peeps to turn into a slideshow  --> Zooming in fully does a weird blur thing (fake DOF?) causing peeps to disappear  --> Peeps puke, pee, and litter an unrealistic amount, making parks look like garbagePaths are difficult to work with and not properly implemented  --> Snaps to nodes at the center of pathways rather than the outside edges  --> Ride queues cannot be curved  --> No stairs  --> Cannot place stalls/rides right next to the path, must create a short path connecting each  --> Elevated pathways often clip through the ground  --> Elevated pathways cannot contain path objects like benches  --> Connecting to other path nodes can be extremely laggyTheming is more limited than previous titles  --> Restricted to generic, western, sci-fi, adventureStaff is poorly implemented  --> No staff zoning  --> Staff ignores buildings, fences, etc, preferring to phase through them like ghostsDeleting is poorly implemented  --> No auto delete for scenery when building coasters/paths  --> Delete tool is extremely laggy when mousing over objectsFilling in parks with rides causes FPS tanking (I went from 60 to 14 after building 4 coasters)tl;dr there are more cons than pros			"

Early Access Review
								Hi got the game finally & Been waiting years wow what a disapointment. the graphics are terrible i would go back to rtc3 graphics, the whole lay out & how you remember the game is gone. Its no longer a roller coaster tycoon. I dont no what it is but it certainty aint one of them. I would have scrapped this game & or would have released this game as something else other than a roller coaster tycoon Because that it is not.Call the game back change the name & release a proper roller coaster tycoon world with the old gen stlye just updated something we all no & all we wanted. You dont fix something that is certainty not broken.It is the only game i have ever played since i was a child & to see it get ruined in this way is heart breaking. You may think i am not being serious but is it possible to buy the rights off you,to make the same sort of game with the old lay out & grapichs. Or has this already been done by ( PLANET COASTER ) ? Old gen look Much better & what people wanted. honestly the grapics seem worse than rtc1 at the moment & ( MY COMP PLAYS GTA- 5 SO COMPUTER IS VERY COMPATABLE ) let me no about the rights issues etc as i am 100% serious & as i am also sure the rtc crowd would certainty buy my idea, Than the one that has been thrownout at the minute.  can you answer me a few questionsis the person who is in charge of development on this game new to the rtc development ? if so why was he allowed anywere near it.?Was everyone new on this project ? i no its been along time since rtc3 but wow how you have ruined the game yes once again i am 100% genuine. i am not leaving rtc like this. i want the rights to make the game properly. scrap this or call it something different. as it is not a roller coaster tycoon please stop calling it that.i can still spend days playing on the old game 1 2 & 3 .  put 4 on for a min & nearly smashed my computer to peices you wrecked that poor game so much & changed it beyond recognition. Like i say its not a rtc i no & i grew up with. Please fire the project manger / Leader as this is his vision & is sucks big time. Someone needs to be held acountable for this decission of next gen graphics etc they should be made to resign as its a major fxxk up. just take a loss scrapp the game & start over .P.S WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR RUINING THE FRANCHISE FOR ME AS I NOW NO IT STOPPED AT RTC3. & WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. HAVE FUN CREATING GAMES FOR THE NEW BREED OF FANS YOUR AINING FOR. I AM SURE THEY WILL LOVE IT JUST AS MUCH AS WE LOVED RTC1,2&3( edited )i have been reading the reviews & PLANET COASTER. keeps poping up i have never heared of the game but went & had a look on youtube. WHY DO THEY HAVE YOUR GAME ? ( it looks like everything i have asked for in the above ) PLEASE DONT TELL ME YOU SOLD THEM THE RIGHTS & RTC CANT USE SOMETHING NO MORE ?IS THIS WHY YOU HAVE GONE NEXT GEN  ?WHY HAS EVERYTHING CHANGED, THE LAYOUT ETC. BUT PLANET COSTER IS THE ORIGINAL LAY OUT OF ( rtc12&3 ). ?DO YOU HOLD ANY CONTRACTS OR DID YOU SELL  SOFTWARE WITH OR TO  PLANET COASTER ? I THINK WE DESERVE TO NO.layout changed beyond recognitionto move anywere on map i had to use keys ? not just go were you pointed the mouse was very hard to delete little trees etcdont get me started on the paths. love the idea of it but it does not work at all needs alot of improvementgrapichs wow they are so bad it shocked me. i dont understand why they are so bad compared to rtc 3 & with going next gen and all that lardy dar stuff. hahah backfire or what the way you pick rides is okay like that lay out. but when you choose a ride dont you dare go into theme park grapichs lol what are use guys thinking when you made this gamecant choose were to put entrance & exit on rides & if you can you need better tutorials(Example) Try to clear some trees big ones okay small ones thank god i have touch screen impossableso place the ride to find entrance & exit stationary or i must of mist something. so that not good straight away.i then try to connect exit path to my original paths. at most 2 clicks away 12 clicks later & some weird path shapes i got there in the end but didnt look pritty lol. line path you dont no if its connected properly like old game you would no weather or not it had.it felt like i had no say in were things would go other than the ride & the odd bit of scenary. & trow in some wierd path shapes that take up half your building area because you have no say in were it goes.i give up there. i will play again today at some point & edit my review further			"

Early Access Review
								So this is the Early Access version of the game and not the completed version, I've played the previous games in the franchise which I spent most of my childhood playing and decided to try out the latest edition. I didnt expect it to be perfect as its still being developed but after around 10 hours of playing the game I pretty much enjoyed it! The game basically takes me back to the original released in 1999 which was simple and focued on the rides and managment, this was the first I played and it was very entertaining. The customisation is also a work in progress as more themes have been confirmed by the developers as well as other stuff. The CoasterBuilder is also new and brilliant! It allows the franchise to evolve with players pulling and dragging the tracks making it more flexible. The second game in the series basically had lots of customisation and built on the first title however the newest game lacks themes and other objects but with more from the developers it soon might improve, the game also has user generated support so lots might be provided from the community of tycoon fans. The third game in the series bacially went 3d and wanted to expand everywhere which in my opinion didnt work and pushed many gamers back to the 2 originals, the UI and campaign were so bad I continued playing RCT2 as it seems the developers went crazy with zoos and water parks however with the newest game going back to its roots and starting again its seems the franchise can get back to its best! Many of the newest games features are very promising and deserve some time to be made perfect, Im willing to wait and share my experience with the developers to make the game decent and a standard which the originals set! You've probably noticied that this review section is full of negetivie reviews, many just complain about the littlest bugs or problems that are not major and are expected as the game is in development! Im not suggesting they are not allowed a opinion but i thinks its alarming and unfair  that many of these players have only played the game for a short amount of time, I consider this not to be enough gametime time to judge a game such as RollerCoasterTycoon. Myself was actually confused getting to know the controls for the first hour however as I progressed it became more enjoyable, easy and relatable to the previous games in the series. The reason I'm writing this is because I would not want any possible players considering trying the game to be put off by a few comments that mostly include minimun issues, Its also  because most of these include the word ""PlanetCoaster"" Which is a similar game but shouldnt be advertised by their fanbase on this review section. Many will claim its a better game but thats your opinion however most of these people have not played RCTW long enought to make a review as many have played for a matter of minutes as I have seen. It also seems many have just followed the trail of popular youtubers, not fully given the game a chance and can not spot a valid problem with thr game that matters deeply in their reviews. These sort of reviews are not reviews so I reconmend you read wisely and check out some videos online to make your opinion.Overall the game is playable and enjoyable in Early Access, It has so much potentical that will hopefully be developed with the fans, its been truely resurrected from the ashes and seems to be going back to its roots similar to the original base game. E.T might have killed Atari along time ago but its certain now that Atari is back and evolving with RollerCoaster Tycoon World!			"

												Okay, This is NOT finished. Yes, i'm rating it up, but it is VERY close to being rated down. I payed 60$ for the beta (OVER A YEAR AGO) and, well, they have not made that much improvment. See there are the good sides to it, but there are major disadvantages. Here's the list:PROS:+Better graphics+It still IS a theme park simulation, which I enjoy.+Many other fixesNow for the list of CONS. Just because there are more does not mean that I do not like the game more than I do, these cons are mainly just minor. -Performance. Yeah. After they said you needed a ""GTX 460"" I was like ""Sweet!"" Yeah, that turned out to be kind of a bummer. See, with my GTX 1060 at high settings, I still was getting lag in my park, and in order to get rid of it I had to restart my game. I put it to low settings, and that did help. (Also, what you can do is minimize it's task in the task manager.) So I am asking to PLEASE fix that.-Peeps from far away. Um, hello? Peeps are getting VERY LOW fps from far distances. I don't know WHY, or how. Is this normal???-Terrain editor. Yeah, it works, or maybe it works... too well. WOW this thing is laggy. 72 FPS normally, dropped down to 12. Yeah.-Coaster editor. You really need a option to depump verticies (My spelling tho) like other roller coaster simulations. See, what this does is it smooths your track out so it is not bumpy, because that is one of my major problems. It looks VERY smooth from the outside, then I go to ride it, and my train is whipping me around.                                                                To Be Honest:       Yes, this game has potential, (I have not tried Planet Coaster) but I think that since more people like PC, it has more potential. Not trying to compare, but I really do think so. And, I hope they fix this game sooner or later, but for now, this game is easily a 6/10.			"

								Updated review -----------------------After spending another hour or so with the game I still struggle to recommend it to anyone especially @ full price. I worked out a lot of stuff that makes it a bit more playable, but still, there is a lot of ""frustration"" in this game in it's current state.  Will it ever be fixed? I don't know, still a negative review it needs a LOT of work.  Not being able to move ride entrances / exits is killer for designing a park the way I like, the paths are horrible, building a straight path to another is usually impossible unless you are lucky enough to be aligned to it's snap points. Coaster builder takes patience, but seems serviable (except having to use shift+mouse wheel to adjust height/tilt is clunky). The peeps look worse than RCT3, with unatural/freaky animations. The graphics sadly also look worse and shadows are so bad they should of left them out. Performace is ""jerky"" especially on-ride camera, which may or may not work. I did a Let's Play Video.


YouTube™ Video: Let's Play Rollercoaster Tycoon World 

			Views: 113		

			Hour long lets play video of me playing Rollercoaster Tycoon World. I play the first campaign in the game. It's about 30 mins in when I start to build a coaster (locked until then).		

Some of the stuff in my first review is not valid like it is possible to snap shops to path (press N). The game lack any love/care/soul which is heartbreaking to see how the mighty series has fallen.  First review below (after an hour of play)------------------------------------------------------------Absolute rubbish, avoid like the plague. Frame rate is horrrendousCoaster builder is clunkyImpossible to build straight paths (sure they are straight but not in relation to any other path in the game)Can't move ride enterance or ExitsPeople being sick, no idea where i'm suppose to employ staff to clean up.**On ride cam... broken.Shadows missing supports (on rollercoasters)Can't snap shops to paths. So build a shop, then have to build a path to it.Paths are horrible / broken.Peeps run like well weird, it just looks un-natural, like they have 2 animatation frames.Placing objects (scenery for instance) is guess work.Building coasters, is there a bush in your way? TOUGH you can't build it. You have to quit the builder, demolish the bush, go back to the coaster, click build. I will be amazed if this game turns into anything playable before Atari abandons it. There is a short list for you to begin with, I'll give it a full review later when I have more time.**I've discovered I have to buy a staff building of the staff type to get the staff I require. So like a mechanic hut for mechanics, or a Janitors hut for cleaners. However, once done, there is no fine control over them, I dont think I can even move them (staff members) manually. So if someone is sick, I just have to hope a member of the cleaner team is wandering past.			"

								This game needs a huge amount of work. I was slightly impressed by the manouverabiliy of the rollercoasters and paths, but thats where the good points end. Graphics are terrible, the guests look ridiculous.The camera is clumsy to move around, I found previous Rct games had cumbersum cameras but Rtc world has taken a huge step back.There is hardly any control over the staff, previous games allowed for training and patrol areas, this game doesnt.I could't get past the tutorial stage before giving up on it.The game appeared to be advertised as a full finished game, I had to read the news feed to discover it wasn't(After paying for it). I'm not sure if I will be entitled to the full game when its complete, but if this game doesn't see a major overhaul before release I will certainly be looking for a refund. "

												I am recommending this ONLY on what I feel is the possibility of the game, not its current state. This Beta is VERY buggy and some of the simple errors/glitches should have honestly been corrected prior to Beta. Some will argue again that this is just a Beta, but some of the errors would be expected in an Alpha. Would love to see the old coaster builder availble. the Spline base is very inaccurate and getting a staright line is next to impossible. Even using gride view the track goes were it wants, almost like i really have no control of the placement of the track pieces. Hope these get worked out, but with some of the issues i have experianced and the community is talking about Dec 10 launch may be a rushed release.... I would be willing to wait to make it right.

								Before you read too far into this here are my computer specs:I-7 Quad Core 4790 @3.60 GhZ processorRAM: 16 GBHDD - 1 TBNvidia GTX GEForce 970 graphics cardWindows 7 Home Premium Service Pack 1Now then:I can't say what everyone else is when it comes to ""destroyed""... but after playing not even 20 minutes... i clicked on the grid option for placing paths, couldn't get them to lay down straight without it glitching out and refusing to connect to the primary park entrance region, which caused Peeps to wander aimlessly with no ability to go out into the park. The sounds of peeps (primarily on thrill rides) glitch out and desync almost immediately, causing sounds to continue BEFORE and AFTER the ride begins. When zooming out the peeps begin to moonwalk, and look as if their legs aren't even moving.Attempting to create a coaster lead to despair. The coaster creation option was slow to respond, crashing twice on me when attempting to place the final piece of track. The third time it gave me problems about opening the track due to a Shop being near the ticket entrance. This lead to me opening and closing the shop rather than the coaster (it wouldn't let me click the coaster), placing lights refused to be placed anywhere unless connected to the side of a STRAIGHT piece of path, which, with how the paths were letting me place them, was impossible since the straight paths were inaccessible nor useful in the park. Adding curved path was even harder, much of it refused to place, saying it was ""too short"" or ""too sharp"" of a turn no matter what i tried....I'm sorry Atari, but you guys really need to work on much of the core aspect of this game You tried, but the excitement of pushing a product out into the public out-weighed your needs to push a few more alpha tests, and a volley of Beta tests, before you opened it to early access.... It's 7 p.m here. And since the refund is only valid until early tomorrow morning i am sad to say but i must take up on that offer. I will look into repurchasing this game when the game is properly taken into consideration, and the game's future is seriously calculated into your next patch-up job to fix these game breaking errors. Goodluck, Atari.In its current state* i cannot support/recommend this game. Please go play Tycoon 3 until they can properly amend the damages. Otherwise give Planet Coaster a try, it's made by the guys who helped make the original 3 RCT's, AND they made Elite: Dangerous.			"

								So far, this game is a disappointment. Obviously, that may change with time and future updates (as will my review).So far, the controls for the game are overly cumbersome, their new roller coaster designer is a nightmare to try and use, and other than (somewhat) updated graphics, the game offers very little in the way of new content.The number of rides offered in the game is pitiful compared to previous games. The shops/buildings are poorly sized and just get in the way. The terrain editor is a nuisance, and to make things worse, you have to individually click each tree/bush/object to delete it and clear space to build. No more click and drag over an area to delete trees, landscaping, etc. The path builder is more aggravating than the one in RCT3.I am hoping the game improves with future updates. So far, it is nowhere near worth the $50 price tag, nor is the ""Deluxe Edition"" worth an extra $10, as it adds almost nothing of interest to the game. Until they make this game worth the buy and worthy of modern graphics and processing ability, save your money and go play RCT2 or 3.			"

												I pre-ordered this game as soon as it became available excited to play the newest generation of one of my favorite game series. I was patient with the delays, betas, and even the last minute switch to Early Alpha when the game supposed to be fully released. However, now that the game is out in ""full"", I have to say I am more then dissapointed! I am so tired of being mislead into pre-ordering or investing in Early Alpha games full of promises, just to end up with a sub-par game! I did not think it possible, but ATARI as made another game like E.T.: THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL!!! Full of potential and promise, just to have a game that is barely playable. The track builder is horrendous! The only thing I DO like about this game is the parking lot outside the front of the park. I am SO glad that I also purchased Planet Coaster as compared to this game, its night and day! My biggest regret is that I cant get a refund from one of the worst purchased I have ever made on Steam...			"

Early Access Review
								Even if your a HUGE fan of the old RCT Games as I am, Walk Away.Its low/POOR quality, maxed out on a 980ti this looks like something you could play on my Tablet, not on a PC in 2016.On top of the very very poor and jerky graphics the actual game is frustrating and buggy to the point I can never see this being released, it was supposed to be ready for release, then they pulled a fast one on all the people that pre ordered a full retail game and gave us a steaming pile of code and called it Early Access.

												This is the same review as i posted on the RCTW forums. So it might not be fitting for a steam review. TL:DR at the endI want to say at first that i am a HUGE RCT fan.I played RCT1 when i was like 7 and i loved the francise ever since. Even RCT3 which alot of people dislike i found still amazing.Now the the World Beta.The graphics are really good i have to admit. But come on. No graphical options?? Are you serious? Not even sound?I literally threw my headphone off when i launched the game. How can you give us a beta without these small options. I was lucky enough that i could turn off AA and such in Nvidia options. But i still got around 40-50fps with NOTHING in the park. I will post my specs and the end of the thread.Another thing is the RAM usage. I hope this improves because 5-6gigs of RAM when you only launch a game that is in a beta state is pretty bad.Now to the game itself.The scenery is pretty good. Just where are the custom buildings that you make wall by wall? I reckon they will be in the full beta but if they are build the same as fences it will be a living hell to make a decent building. The fences are SO bad to place. You cant make a decent fence unless with the grid. But with the grid you cant place em next to curve pathes. And no end pieces. Your fences end with an open spot.Pathes are good. Nothing wrong with them. Easy to place easy to use. Though a few options of queue pathes? Must be intentional i guess but still. And no curved queues? Why is that?All the foliage is really well done. Bit few options on shrubs and flowers but that will probably change on full release with the workshop. Trees are fine in my opinion. More palm trees would be nice though.All the other path addons are fine. Trash cans, lights etc. They look good, are good to place and nothing wrong with that.Now to the coastersFirst off all, the color options are so low. Where is the create every color palet?? You would expect a game from 2015 to have atleast a color palet that lets you make the colors yourself? (Red, Green, Blue sliders from 0-225 or something)I guess this will be better at release although i dont have my hopes up for that.Now to the building of the coaster.Its awfull. Dont get me wrong here. Controls are pretty good. The way you control how you edit the coaster with your mousewheel etc. works good. A few bugs here and there like a coaster has 0degrees roll and is still banked. And a few other small things which i know for sure have been reported already. If not i will report them later in the bug tracker.The spline based building (without the grid) is not working at all. Atleast not for me. You cannot make a good lifthill without the hill being a little bit off to the left or right. Which is very unrealistic since lift hills are perfectly straight. Then there is the marker under the track that shows how ""Safe"" the coaster is. Its not accurate at all. How is a left turn that is banked inwards safer than one banking outwards?? How seriously dont understand how that works. Maybe i am just stupid and dont know at all how coasters work at about 5000+ hours across all the three previous games and after visiting alot of real life coaster. But for me this is wrong.You added the ability to edit the coaster on the spot itself where there is need of adjustments so you dont have to remove the whole track. It sucks. The moment you add a new edit point (the green bulb) you have it locked to your mouse immedietly. The track instantly goes up or down a little and you have a little bump in it. No matter how i try it keeps happening. I might not be used to it yet but after about a 100 times i think i should've known how if there was a way to do it right.There is no real way to make a good looping are any other element. Sure you can let someone else make it for you, download it from the workshop and add it in your coaster. But what is the fun in that. I want to make them myself. Its just SO hard to finetune the track pieces because of the issue above (the green bulb issue).Since when are block brakes wheeles? Seriously guys. Where you drinking to much whisky that evening? You have normal brakes that look like brakes. And block brakes are wheels. Also, the Accelerator Coaster doesnt have a launch track. Only the tiny piece at the start that you cant drag out so why even conisder putting it in the beta? Same for the Dive Coaster, there is no Dive element (the Holding Brake). So why add this one aswell? And where is the normal B&M Sitdown. You add all these unique coaster types (Wing, Accelerator, Dive) But you forget the most basic one. A Hyper Coaster doesn't make inversions. I reckon its not that hard to think about that. And that while you guys even cooperated with Six Flags.TL:DRThis game needs ALOT of work. And to much to be do-able in 40 days. This game needs so much work it probably needs to around end Q1 2016. Buggy (i know its a beta but to much stuff isnt working correctly), bad coaster builder. The grid system back in RCT1-3 was SO much better. There werent many options to tracks as there are now for sure. But they worked perfectly and were always right. The overall game as it stands now is awfull. As it is now i wish i didnt buy it and instead bought Anno 2205 or Planet Coaster as Anno will never fail and Planet Coaster is cheaper and as far as dev blogs go really promising. I hope you guys (the devs and forum users) understand my frustration about the game in the current manner and hope that my feedback will be taken into consideration because you have atleast one sad costumer as of right now. As i stated earlier i love the RCT francise and was so excited for this game. Its just bad as it is.Greets,Azrail			"

Early Access Review
I have updated this review with content relating to the Early Access release. It is following the beta weekend review.BETA WEEKEND 1What do I think of Roller Coaster Tycoon World? I was hoping it would be great and wow everyone, but this game is never going to be ready by the posted release date, if the roller coaster module is anything to go by. In attempting to build a wooden roller coaster (simple enough, right?) I never once was able to complete a circuit with the train. The physics engine in this is horrible, and if I try to make a tight turn with banking, the only think i ever see is 'SLOPE TOO STEEP'. I think I hate this game. Absolutely hate it. I know the devs are desparate to make some money on this, but this game is not okay. Unless the second beta is better, I'm going to be one of many thousands who return their pre-release orders.SO MANY DERAILMENTS!!! (literaly)Early Access: Day 1In my first experience with the now long-term beta of this game, I must say it's really in need of optimizations. As of right now, this game is still not ready for a full release (thank goodness they went EA if they HAD to release it now, but they could have waited...). So, how has the fourth installment of the Roller Coaster Tycoon franchise fared? Not as well as I'd hoped.The GraphicsThey're not bad, but they're not good either. Visually, they're very pleasing. However, the peeps are flat skins (clothing is not a separate layer) which is disillusioning. In addition, the feel of the ride textures leave the tiniest bit of nagging that something's missing. Overall, though, the graphics are actually very good to look at. BUT, good luck getting a good framerate even with a Titan. The game set my settings on high and I run a GTX 970. There is 1 setting above that which a single GTX 980 or Titan should be capable of running at 60 fps. For the graphics, to be honest, I'm surprised my computer couldn't run 60 fps.There is a plus, though. Since the devs know framerate is bad, they went and added a tickbox that reduces the graphics demand in favor of a more playable framerate, so that you almost never dip below 20 fps. Almost. When building new things in a park that already is a bit crowded, you can dip down all the way to the 1-3 fps region.GameplayWell, it definitely feels like a more open and controllable world than previous RCT games. Because nothing is stuck to the grid, a whole new variety of layout options become available. That said, because of the size of the park, a whole lot of creativity has been thrown out the window. It would take dozens of this park to fill the parks you built in RCT 1-3. This park is only big enough to house 1 large coaster or 2 smaller ones (what the ♥♥♥♥, right?), in addition to your arsenal of small rides needed to keep the less extreme peeps happy. Speaking of those peeps, the way they scream when on a ride is all at once, so you just have an occasional scream that hurts your ears instead of constant enjoyment from your peeps.Building ToolsThe path and stall building tools are fairly intuitive. With the freeform option, you draw in any direction you like. With the grid turned on, you can keep everything aligned to a coordinate system (perpendicular and parallel to the park entrance, mind you). With snap turned on (this will turn off grid, and vice versa), you can place your paths at 90 degree angles to each other, even if they're not on the grid angle. It also allows for a few other things, like placing stalls directly onto existing paths, and more controllably placing trees and other objects adjacent to paths. All in all, having the three building modes is very useful, but I would like a localized grid aligned with a path I just drew if I had both grid and snap enabled. That would be very useful.Specific Building Tools:The path building tool - While this tool is great for building paths on the ground, you don't have nearly enough control with the path height. The only interval for heigh is 7 feet, which is too much, especially given the small spacing the grid has.The Flat Ride Building Tool - Well, it's just placement and angle rotation. On the other hand, unlike in previous RCT games, you can't choose the locations for the entrance and exit to the ride, which was part of how we were able to tightly pack tons of rides into a small space in the last games. And given how much smaller this game's parks are, we really need as much control of the arrangement as possible.Roller Coaster Building Tool - The roller coaster building tool really isn't bad anymore. Unlike in the beta weekend, coasters no longer crash for no reason, and the tool is relatively intuitive. That said, the station platforms are very sparse in selection and have MASSIVE footprints. There's already a significant queue and a horrendously long exit walk for every single station platform. And you can't pick where the entrance and/or exit come from, or the direction of the train. Also, track banking doesn't actually listen to what you say. For example, if I have a tight turn on an incline with steep banking, the track is actually rendered as flat and level. Decrease the banking, and the track banks outward (why?). Most of the time, using the building tools is fairly intutive. You have pre-built segments that you can adjust the scale of, or you can click on the ground away from nodes and build your own track. Working with nodes is intutive, but not getting to node mode. If you make a mistake, I have no clue how to abort the new piece without quitting the editor entirely. But on the plus side, you can create and delete nodes in the middle of the track without disconnecting it all. Overall, it still needs a bit of work, but coasters don't crash for no reason, and using it is largely intutive.ConclusionThis game is labeled appropriately as something that's in Early Access. It's glitchy somewhat, and some of the controls don't feel quite finished. That said, there are other problems with this game. Flat rides don't have configurable exits, roller coaster stations are massive and just as unconfigurable (and lacking in variety), and the park size is WAY TOO ♥♥♥♥ING TINY! Will Atari and Nvizzio Creations pull it all together? Maybe. I wouldn't put any money on it happening this year. I would LOVE for them to pull it together and give us something amazing as though they've been holding out, but it really doesn't seem like RCT is on top any more. Planet Coaster, even being in alpha, is already incredibly customizable, allowing for every building to be custom made, a huge park size, and lots more detail. On top of that they're the brains behind RCT3 who did a very good job for the first 3D implementation of the series(no offense, Nvizzio). I expect a lot more from Planet Coaster in the near and far future than I do from Roller Coaster Tycoon World. For now, I'm getting my refund.			"

I am planning to get a new graphics card but i dont know if that will help or not. Do i need a new proseccer or graphics card. I have a i5 2.90 Ghz and Geforce 420 GT. I dont recomend this game if you dont have the right graphics card and processer.If you do have fun.			"

												I was very excited to get my hands on the beta for Rollercoaster Tycoon World, being a fan of the series since RCT2 when I was a kid. However, the beta has shown that the game is definitely not ready. (Hence the reason why they changed the release date from the 10th to the 29th)Pros:The graphics are nice.Curved paths are awesome.The game sounds great, from the chains on the coaster tracks to the peep conversations.Cons:The camera doesn't work for me half the time.The new RollerCoaster builder is way too complex for me. There's gotta be a way to simplify it.The framerate gets pretty bad for me at some points. (From 60 to 10-15)The game eats RAM like it's candy.In conclusion; I know it's a beta, and I know the game has tons of potential, but with the release date being right around the corner, I feel like it's going to either get delayed to 2016 or have a crappy launch. I really wish the game becomes the RCT of my dreams.			"

Early Access Review
								I have played many other roller coaster and fun park management games. This is a great game If not the best and yet it is still in Early Access. It runs very smoothly on my computer, I haven\'t had any crashes yet. There are a lot of rides and coasters to choose from and the graphics are superb.I have read other reviews comparing this to Planet Coaster. I have played planet coaster and ended up just playing with the buildings and making all the shops look nice. I spent hours designing buildings. That’s all it has for me, it’s something that Tycoon World doesn\'t have and I wish it would. Previous version of Roller Tycoon did have this feature. Why have Roller Tycoon World removed such a great feature? Hopefully they will add back in a good building editor again that is like Planet Coaster and it really would be the best theme park game ever. "

It lacks charm, or any of the draw of its predecessors. The pathway tools are incredibly frustrating. What features there are, are incredibly limited, even giving it the benefit of the doubt of its early access status. The game never crashed for me, but the gameplay itself is at best glitchy, and at worst, they make the game unplayable. Taking into consideration the repeated times the game was pushed back for release and its steep price, I can say with all confidence that even one after more glitches have been cleared, it is not a game worth buying.

								It looks like people dont get the whole Early access. Yes, the game has many bugs, but what do you expect from an early access?If you dont want bugs, wait until a stable release.Still, the game is playable in sandbox, where you can just build and dont think about money. Because of some bugs (like the mechanics dont inspect your coaster what so ever, so they all become 0% reliable, and peeps won't take it) its very hard to make a successful park in campaign.But I love the game for what it is, and cant wait untill next update.

												GREAT POSSIBILITIESThat being said, it is currently unplayable in its current state. Beta or not, there are no options to adjust graphics for performace issues, the coaster builder is an amazing idea, but its just wierd and difficult to use.			"

Early Access Review
								Despite all the negative feedback, this game really isn't that bad. It offers a lot of content for an Early Access Game. More than some AAA-titles these days. I'm also a fan of their spline-based coaster editor. Once you learn how it works you can build any shape with it. The graphics are mediocre but that's okay for me.There might be some performance issues and bugs but I'm sure they'll fix that.Keep it up Nvizzio!EDIT: About a year later the game still doesn't run great. It definitly got better but it's just not enough. So that's a bummer. They improved the graphics, fixed some issues and added more content though. The workshop is a nice addition too. I guess I'll try it again next year. I'm still confident that Nvizzio manage it at some point, but I doubt that the game will recover from its negative reviews.			"

Early Access Review
								Well what can i say, I had been waiting for this game for years and after taking a break from playing the earlier releases. I was glad to give it another try, how wrong i was.The devs of this game are clearly paided in peanuts, and to be honest the Monkeys in Gibraltor could have made a better version. All they seem to care about is all the critism about the graphics. Well i have a fairly good specced machine and even on the lowest setting its yerky. I wont name the other 2 early release games but they dont have the same awful laggyness and stuttering, unresponsive menus.Was Atari's brief for this project that they wanted to ruin the Rollercoaster Tycoon name, cleary this has worked.Under no curcumstances would i ever recommend this game, please take my advise and do not purchase.You would be better off purchasing the older version ie 1 2 or 3.

Early Access Review
								This game is fun and all. But after playing it from release, it kind of left a sour taste in my mouth. I understand the early access blah blah blah. But still. I hope to get back into it when they finalize the game. I'll see where they end up and compare it to how it was when I first played it. I havn't played this game since april. And I only have 4 hours total on it. We'll see how my view changes when they finish the game, if they do, and then I'll be able to give a better review. I love the Roller Coaster Tycoon series, this one just doesn't bring home the bacon just yet. One complaint I have so far is the way you assign staff.... In previous games, you bought staff people one at a time. Now You have to build a building that has a set number of staff members in it. I dislike this option. It takes up a lot of space. I understand a break room, and that can be arranged but, building multiple staff buildings is really annoying. Hopefully someone will see this and consider another way to change how we buy staff.I do recommend this game, as I feel it will have the potential when its finished, but that being said, I don't currently play it at the moment. I may get back into it some day. It just doesn't have the vibe I remember getting back from rollercoaster tycoon 2.			"

												Plain awful game. Wasn't anywhere near what I had hoped that it would be. I have been playing this series since its release when I was alot younger and I was hoping for it to revitalize itself through Rollercoaster Tycoon World. Needless to say, it sucks. Take my review's word for it as well as every other person writing a negative review for this game. Stay away, its not worth your time or money. If you're wanting a good theme park game where you can burn hours on end feeling like a kid again, stay away from this one. Check out Planet Coaster or Parkitect first.			"

												Got the early edition. I spent over 100 hours building, (as it consistantly crashed, froze and slowed to a snail's pace.) So I gave up the game for a while. I figured being an early release, it must have had some bugs.I got back to it 8 months later the find a massive 1.3GB update... and all of my saved files were gone. I tried to start a new world and it crashed before getting to the park screen. I have since deleted the program. I would not recommend this game.			"

												Was looking forward to the end of EA, but I have to say this game is up to now a disappointment. The things that annoy me the most are:-	The visitors of the park are not animated but slide across the field if you zoom out-	The graphics are OK for a game like this, I do not expect much here but the problem is the inconsistency of the framerate. Sometimes the counter fluctuates for no obvious reason at all giving an overall leggy experience-	That I am not allowed to place the entrances and exits of my rides -	Building paths is sometimes extremely annoying because the paths will connect to each other only at certain positions leaving you at time with a very crooked layout -	The huge size of the rollercoaster entrance stations-	Micro managing the staff by building staff support buildings.In the end I would not recommend this game to anyone except for those more interested in landscaping or modelling because the tools to create and design parks are quite good once you get a hang for it. Except for the pathway system which I do not like at all. "

												SoooooAfter a few months TRYING to play this game, I have to say: It`s♥♥♥♥♥♥ Unplayable. I could cry.. coz I remember those times with RCT on Windows 98, happy times, RCT3 Soaked AMAZING, thank you. After that disappointment, I downloaded a Beta Version of PC, I didn`t want to judge to early... And guess what, that BETA was already better, than the crap you guys keep delivering us. So I bought PC and I`m happy again :)Now: The only good thing in RCT is the Coaster Editor, easier to build and the ride is smoother than in PC. But it`s obviously useless, when ur computer is crashing after building 3-4 coaster and having 1000 peeps. I just can`t figure out how you guys can ignore those SERIOUS performance problems. ARE YOU EVEN WORKING? Better releasing stupid PbP objects, which are quite fancy, but get`s your computer down even faster. I don`t want to bash that game, coz it was a LEGEND once. Just don`t buy it guys, try PC and decide yourself. And by the way: I paid ******* 70 bugs for the Early Access, now its 35, and still not ""a game"". I dont want a refund, I want you to feel bad, you are criminals. This game, was maybe one of the biggest fails of a once bright shining game, even worse than No Man`s Sky. You should have kept the origin dev`s. I can see them dying by laughing playing your ""game"".Pls release this review, everyone should know before thinking about buying this game. This game should be banned fro steam, `til it `s running right.Have a nice day			"

								It looks like people dont get the whole Early access. Yes, the game has many bugs, but what do you expect from an early access?If you dont want bugs, wait until a stable release.Still, the game is playable in sandbox, where you can just build and dont think about money. Because of some bugs (like the mechanics dont inspect your coaster what so ever, so they all become 0% reliable, and peeps won't take it) its very hard to make a successful park in campaign.But I love the game for what it is, and cant wait untill next update.

								Absolutely terrible. I pre-ordered it for a full-game, not this early access nonsense. Unfortunately I pre-ordered off Steam so I can not get a refund. Fortunately I only paid a fraction of the cost and even at ~$20 this is a complete waste of money. I pre-ordered back in January before any mention of going early access. No way I would have gone through with that had I know they'd pull this stunt at the last minute. I just feel I got taken advantage of. The game is completely broken. Even with my GTX 980/i5 4670k and modest medium settings the game suffered FPS dramatically and dipped into the 20's. I played for about an hour, did multiple restarts and new games and I was never able to build a roller coaster. I was able to build buildings and such but after I rebooted the game I could no longer build any buildings. I kept getting spam notifications to ""BUILD MORE LIGHTS YOUR PARK IS DARK!"" well guess what? Couldn't even access the scenery builder. I just.. I can't even fathom this. Wow.			"

								Amid the rampant negativity surrounding this game, I feel compelled to give this game a glowing recommendation. WHen Early Access finally became available, and the flood gate of negative reviews opened, I was nervous and held off on buying the game until a few days ago. When I did, I was acutally quite shocked at how much hate the game was wtill recieving, because my experience was nowhere near as horrible or even remotely bad as so many people have warned in the reviews. In fact, my partner has Planet Coaster, and he actually plays this game more than he does that one, and swears it is better in nearly every way.The game is not finished, and understanding this is paramount if you are even remotely going to enjoy playing. If occational glitches and crashes is a problem for you, then DO NOT BUY THE GAME. Too many people marring the reputation of this excellent game because of their own unachievable expectations of a game in Alpha. That said, it is still very much the RCT that I love and remember fondly, with a fresh coat of paint and a vast majority of new features, both experiemental and not. It's updated often, and the developers genuinely do want to make this as excellent as they say. So if you can spare your patience, and would like to see the evolution of this game, do yourself a favor, because I was skeptical as well, but I feel it was worth it. I'm even considering upgrading to deluxe. If you don't have patience for crashes and bugs (yes, the game has crashed on me twice), then wait until it's out of Early Access.			"

								Update #3 released 4/20/2016My original review still stands....so much work to be done on the ""game"" it's not even funny.I'll report back after the next update, as of right now I still cannot reccomend this ""game"" whatsoever.Why is game in quotations you ask?  Because playing it is not fun.... at all..... it's a chore. It's a chore to look past all of the flaws..... it's a chore to deal with all of the flaws.Rated 1/10 : would not chore again -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Uninspired...bland...disappointing...wonky...laggy...glitchy.....There's nothing about this game pulling me back in to play.  The bones of a decent game are there...maybe?How the developers handle this will determine the outcome of this game. I sure hope I can change this review at some point.At best, this is a $20 game IMHO as far as value goes.I would wait till AT LEAST two or more patches have been released before considering the purchase if you're considering-----------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE 7/2/2016 Played for 25 minutes...crashed after clicking ""Ride View"" button, still a boat load of issues.Another pet peeve is the peeps jerky and unrealistic movement.Major FPS issues after only placing only a handful of rides (It's not my card or systems problem)I still can't recomend this ""game""			"

												Okay, as a huge fan of the previous games there is a massive gap between old rct and new rct. If you were a fan of old rct do not buy this game. That's the early TL:DR.Here are the likes1. Terrain and water editor is nice2. music isn't bad3. more coaster editor customizationand dislikes1. coaster editor is far too complex for average user, even above average users. See below for more details.2. takes way too long to load sandbox mode. SANDBOX MODE!3. can't right click to delete things such as pathways4. MUST move camera with arrow keys, no more mouse movement5. None of the coaster styles have relevant pictures to determine what they are, only stick figure sillouhetes.6. you don't have a setting to remove cars from your trains. To add you simply click on where the extra cars should be7. Terrain editor wont change the already existing support height leaving terrain indents that are quite ugly8. Scenery isn't separated by group anymore. Oregon Trail Wagons apparently fit in with UFO's and pumpkins.Here is my report of my experience on coastercrazy.com's forum skype chat regarding the game:- alright rctw gimme what you got- the music reminds me of a mix between sims 3 and a merry go round- really not sure why a sandbox mode took MY $3000 custom build 2 minutes to load- why can't I right click to delete things?- can't move the camera with mouse apparently even with the highly unnecessary ""move tool"". you need to use the arrow keys, something never needed before. WHAT AN AWESOME NEW FEATUJRE GUISE! [/sarcasm]- None of the coaster styles have relevant pictures to determine what they are, only stick figure sillouhetes.- wow the coaster editor... take everything you knew about rct and throw it out the window.- make a kiddie coaster. A good looking kiddie coaster. What was a 3 minute build is now 15 minutes.- this coaster editor is way too complex for any casual or even a step above that user- it's so customizable but that doesn't mean better. Sure it'll be able to make somewhat realistic coasters even WITHOUT A STRAIGHT TRACK SETTING AT ALL but it won't be recieved well by anyone that wants a casual non stressful experience.- as far as track is concerned imagine a spline editor that automatically detects radius- they took a simple game idea and added infinitely more steps- on the bright side making death coasters is way easier- For extra ride settings, you don't have a setting to remove cars from your trains. To add you simply click on where the extra cars should be. - THIS IS NOT ROLLER COASTER TYCOON!- I love this new terrain editor I do but it wont change the already existing support height leaving terrain indents that are quite ugly.- The water tool works very well and something I really like.- Scenery isn't separated by group anymore. Oregon Trail Wagons apparently fit in with UFO's and pumpkins.- Overall a very sub par experience, definitely should not be named under roller coaster tycoon.			"

								Absolutely terrible. I pre-ordered it for a full-game, not this early access nonsense. Unfortunately I pre-ordered off Steam so I can not get a refund. Fortunately I only paid a fraction of the cost and even at ~$20 this is a complete waste of money. I pre-ordered back in January before any mention of going early access. No way I would have gone through with that had I know they'd pull this stunt at the last minute. I just feel I got taken advantage of. The game is completely broken. Even with my GTX 980/i5 4670k and modest medium settings the game suffered FPS dramatically and dipped into the 20's. I played for about an hour, did multiple restarts and new games and I was never able to build a roller coaster. I was able to build buildings and such but after I rebooted the game I could no longer build any buildings. I kept getting spam notifications to ""BUILD MORE LIGHTS YOUR PARK IS DARK!"" well guess what? Couldn't even access the scenery builder. I just.. I can't even fathom this. Wow.			"

												 I was so excited to finally get my hands on the new coaster builder but once I actually started using it I was extremely disappointed. The coaster builder did not seem to want to follow what little instructions the game provided. When I told the game to make the track go straight up, it made a loop. When I changed the incline so it would not loop it twisted the track in the process. When I tried to tried to move my cursor to straight out the track it made the track appear on the other side of the map. Then when I tested the failure of a track the new trains kept crashing into the old trains that would not go away. That little piece is beside the point. The point of the weekend one beta according to their FAQ was to show off the new coaster builder. It says on their FAQs that all of the possible coasters are unlocked. I put in my request for a refund because the coaster building tool is so bad that I will have to wait for reviews on the game's coaster builder before re-purchasing this game. The developers themselves have already promised updates after release and based on how poor the coaster builder is right now I do not feel like paying for a ""beta"" on release waiting for the developers to fix later what they should have done right the first time.

								So, before I start with my review, I want to clear up one thing that many people who gave this game a negative view missed: YOU CAN EXTEND THE SIZE OF YOUR PARK IN THE SAME FASHION AS YOU CAN EXTEND YOUR CITY IN CITIES SKYLINES. Now that's all cleared up, lets continue. Okay, so there's only 2 problems I have found so far; 1: The game isn't fantastically optimised, but is still more than playable at medium settings. 2: The roller coaster manual builder is quite tricky to get the hang of initally (however after a couple of goes, it's really easy to understand). Aside from that, the game is absolutely amazing, I've been on it for 4 hours straight so far and I'm loving every minute of it, I can't wait to see what workshop content will bring and how much the game will improve over time! So far it gets a 9/10.			"

												At this time, I could not recommend this game to anyone. I'll change this review later if the game redeems itself, but for now, there's just too much to be disappointed with. This is currently not looking to be the fun the first three games were.First off, the coaster editor.Yes, it's a spline based system which means more flexibility in how you can design your coaster, but it also means more weirdness. I've had issues where a stright, flat, non-banked piece of track gives me the error ""Curve too steep"", and similar issues with a gigantic turn (probably at least 150 feet in radius) giving me the same error with little to no banking. After I figured out a few of the quirks I was finally able to build a coaster, but that took almost the full half hour I played.Second, the actual coaster operation.Say you manage to actually complete your coaster. Now it's time to test it. Which, by the way, you can't do while paused. Perhaps it'll crash into one of the nodes mysteriously left by the editor that didn't get removed. All right, it's a beta, weird things happen. Next run, it'll pass through it just fine, only to clip into the track and crash a bit before the station. Next run, it'll crash into the *other* node left by the editor. Finally, we get a run that succeeds.			"

								Having been a Rollercoaster Tycoon fan since the game first arrived in 1999.I remmeber the weeks leading up to it they had it at virgin Records in their game department. The thrill of that game still excites me, even 2 and 3 are designed the same as the Original Game. This however is not, atleast not yet. The game is still an Early Release, that being said its just a slight step above being termed a official beta. There is alot of good aspects to this game, the coaster design system being one major possitive note. The major negavitve atm would prob have to be the pathing system, its not as clear as 1-3 was, however you can make diaganal paths which i dont recall being able to back then. So for paths its a improvement that just needs further mechanics to par with the mechanics of either previous gens of RCT or just something all together more modern. The game will take alittle adjusting to if/when compared to previous versions. While alot of people have given it a bad review and i could imagine asked for a refund, I am not going to do that. I will admit i did consider it. I also know as the improvements get implemented I would want to play it again and rebuy it. I also would like to see firsthand the improvements and modifications to a series I grew up enjoying. In the end my review might not be the most helpful because while i give the game a thumbs up, it is a early release and I could respect peoples opion to not like the game. But those of you who grew up with this series like I did might find a appreciation in seeing its future unfold.			"

								Review is for 3/30/2016 Early AcessUm, no more like early beta. Need more maint, cleaner and medic buildings than rides. Entertainers ...don't entertain. Number of cars are locked to 1 on coasters. Scenery is bland and will be quickly workshop replaced by real talent. Footprint of smaller rides dispropotional. Peeps are generic and very repetitive. Google 'amusement park crowd' and click images, that is what peeps should look like. Hungry peeps will only eat at their preferred food stand so you have to place 5 food stands that are bigger than some rides everywhere to feed the puke piles at the end of every ride, yes every ride including a slide. Cotten candy, ice cream, sno cones are all great shops, but not in this game, just a one sweets vendor, yet 5 different food types, lol. In november they handed us a turd, we handed it back. Now it is still a turd with sugar poured on it, but it still tastes like a turd. On the plus side they seemed to have improved the coaster builder, but that is all that was fixed. No billboards generic or custom. No custom music. Tiles look like 80's sidescroller tiles. Other sim games from 2006 did better at tiles than this one.Finally would I recommend....um NO! Still early beta, wait a few years for the community to fix.Review is for 11/1/2015 BetaPhysics are severely broken. Coaster works fine in test, then kills everyone on first hill. Coaster cars from failed runs lay on ground or track preventing modification or testing. old track still ghosts so after so much editing, coaster can not be moved to rid self of wrecked cars. Don't speed up time or cars will fly off map. Customers have no personality and look like ghosts(Come to find out this was a Halloween intended prop). I understand it's still beta, but just say in patch notes that you want to make sure it boots up and nothing works right still. No custom billboards found either.Don't bother spinning your wheels, it's not ready yet.11/2/2015 edited typos and Peeps coment. Still would not recommend till a lot of bugs are fixed. It is still beta and I hope that is the reason, but this is not my first beta rodeo and this is the buggiest game I've beta tested.			"

												So disappointed! iI am hoping it is just a case of getting used to the game mechanics, but making a rollercoaster is just not fun! its terrible. It would help with some tutorials maybe once the gme is released properly? After an hour and a half i made one simple path and thats it. I tried a rollercoaster twice, banking curves are impossible, it just says too steep even when its clearly a gentle bank. So the rollercoaster falls off as the corners are flat. Just so gutting, I have waited years for this and I am worried I have completely wasted my money.EDIT.after a further 90 mins playing the beta, the game is just broken. - cannot delete rollercoaster parts resulting in unfinishable tracks. - just not any fun at all- frequenty crshing and broken. i know its a beta but its out in just over a month and this needs a lot longer to make playable-rollercoaster falls through tracks- takes an hour to make the most terribleof rollercoasters, not realistic,editing is a nightmare. I am a 35 year old and this is just not any fun in any way at all. RCT 1,2and 3 were so much fun building rollercoasters, this just is not.requested refund.AVOID until fully released and reviews available for the finished product.			"

Early Access Review
 Comparing development (continuously updated review)  As most people tend to compare quasi-similar games to each other, perhaps it's best to provide a review that does so without any bias or prejudice, as the vast majority of reviews lack the most important elements these should have: honesty and objectivity. So let's get to it. Both Rollercoaster Tycoon World (RCTW) and Planet Coaster (PC) are halfway through their alpha stages (or beta, the difference in meaning has become insignificant over the last years) and both games show great promises and annoying bugs at the same time, which is completely normal for any game under development of course. PC has just seen the release of its second alpha (the second out of three) and RCTW has had major and minor updates over the last two months, since it has entered early access on Steam. Let's start with pointing out what PC delivers and lacks at this point in time.PC is a game which features a more or less cartoonic graphic style and is mainly focused on building custom scenery and constructions by using various structural elements and decorative items. This way no two parks will look the same and the possibilities are numerous (not endless, as that's technically impossible), especially with the latest update in which it has been made a lot easier to fine tune the movement of objects on multiple axes. The amount of different structural elements to obtain such a desired beautiful park is quite decent, although it remains to be seen how many will still be added in the future before its final release in autumn 2016, as the amount of newly added objects was amazing during the first alpha, but rather disappointing in the second. Another main focus within the game is the animations of the park guests. These are far from optimal at this point, but it's obvious to see that the creators tend to accomplish guests who accurately reflect their mood, appear to be responsive to their environment (including the rides of course) and behave as natural as possible. This feature still needs development, but it's too soon to tell whether they succeeded or failed, as the park management (which includes this feature as far as I'm concerned) will be released in the third alpha stage next summer, so I will leave this part of the consideration for now. Moving on to the flat rides it seems the developers were bereft of any resourcefulness, as most rides are mere copies of previous rollercoaster tycoon games (RCT 1, 2 and 3) and in the second alpha they even added a second Ferris' Wheel, whereas one would have been more than enough (and don't forget that another flat ride - the Whirley Rig - is also a Ferris' wheel to tell the truth). Is it really that hard to come up with rides that are actually different from predecessors and at least somewhat different from other rides? Let me give you another example: the newly added Insanity ride is just a copy from previous rollercoaster tycoon games and it's also remarkably similar to the Hammer Swing. Why don't they add rides which they've actually come up themselves instead of merely copying others and/or existing rides (just compare the Brain Surge from Nickelodeon Universe to the Psychola ride in the game). To be fair, the same mistake was made with the development of RCTW, as they added two slides (whereas one would have been more than sufficient) and they failed to provide rides which are different and interesting enough from my perspective, just as the developers of PC did. The number of flatrides is still quite low within both games, but I'm sure this will improve on both fronts. Finally, let's move on to my biggest disappointment of PC: the coaster builder. It contains some nice features, such as being able to change colours of the tracks and the supports (although the colours of the carts can't be changed for some unknown reason) and there's a good amount and variety of coaster types, but the building itself is downright frustrating and tedious, as you constantly have to move the cursor from the screen to the interface at the bottom of the screen and back again to build track sections. The building process is also rigid and doesn't feel natural due to a lack of flexibility and a poorly designed interface. This feature has barely been improved upon since the release of Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 in 2004, which is clearly an impairment in this game. The second alpha delivered us the finished coaster builder according to the developers, so apparently they deem it to be completed.Let's now move on to RCTW. This game features a style similar to parks like Six Flags or Hersheypark (as opposed to PC which is more in the direction of Disneyland or Disney World) and is mainly focused on the coaster builder, although various flatrides and scenery items have been included of course. The coaster builder is not perfect (which will be improved in upcoming updates), but building coasters has quite a natural and flexible feel to it, does possess a good interface to make use of all the different functions the spline based building tool has to offer and provides the option to change colours as well. This feature has clearly been improved upon since its last installment of 2004, whereas PC failed to do this. On the other hand, the flexibility and possibilities PC offers for scenery items and custom constructions are not included in RCTW, as the latter does provide a freeform placement system, but is not aimed at allowing players to make their own buildings within the game at this point in time. This feature will be added to the game later on, probably once the game is pulled out of Early Access, which will happen given the amount of regular updates since its release (although many claimed it never would). Moreover, the animation of the peeps (park guests) is fairly poor in RCTW in comparison to PC. They behave and move unnaturally and need quite a few improvements, but the developers are still working on this. My aforementioned criticism on the flatrides also applies to RCTW. Several other missing features are more striking in both games, however, as both games don't include water, dark or transport rides (although both the developing teams promised to add these to the final product of games) and both games don't contain any kind of weather system or simulation (this feature has been promised for RCTW, but not for PC at the moment).So, which game would I recommend to you ? Both, as long as the promises that have been made regarding both games are met. Which game should you buy? That's up to you (I bought both games). To me it all comes down to preferences. Do you prefer a theme park builder which mainly focuses on beautiful scenery items and custom buildings just like Disney World, then go for Planet Coaster. If the building of amazing coasters and parks such as Six Flags is more to your liking, then go for Rollercoaster Tycoon World. I truly believe that both games are on the same level at this point in time, as both contain both good and bad features and both offer promises and bugs, which is utterly normal for games under development (as I already said). Let's hope that we will have two good theme park building games coming out at the end of this year.			"

Early Access Review
								Okay so I have been a huge fan of the RCT games since the launch of the first one.  That being said, I know there are a lot of things that are still sketchy with RCTW.  I was not fortunate enough to have been able to play this during Beta.  However, I wish people would not be so impatient and give it a chance.  I realize RCTW was in the works for a VERY long time and I was one of the people who was very much looking forward to its release.  I think for an Early Access game, it's quite good!  Some of the best games I have played have been Early Access games and while they were a bit low grade at their release, they are absolutely amazing now!  I believe RCTW has more than enough potential to be one of those games.  The devs did state that some things were limited due to the fact that it is Early Access and that they are still putting work into it.  There are definitely some graphical issues that need to be worked through and I would like to see the ability to change the colors of rides and incorporate our own music.  I can also see the some minor glitches in free form tracks and paths where it is difficult to create the exact shape that you want.  However, I feel that overall, it is a wonderful game!  I am really shocked at all the negative Early Access feedback.  It's EARLY ACCESS!  Meaning.....the devs want to know what the community wants to see done to create a better gaming experience.  They don't want a bunch of nasty comments about how their product was a flop and you should just go play some other rollercoaster game.  That is not at all constructive.  Anyway, yes, I would highly recommend this game and if you go into it with an open mind, looking at its future potential and not its current failures, then I think you will have a lot of fun!			"

Early Access Review
								I want to put a break in the train of hatred this game seems to be getting. First off, yes. I have not played Coaster Planet. Does Coaster Planet look nice? Yes. So does this, however. Are there things that I'd like to see improve? Well sure. That can be said about many games and this, fortunately, is still being worked on. For what I've got, I'm more than happy. Now that my little rant is over, allow me to explaid why I recomment this game:Gameplay: Overall, the game plays more or less exactly like RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. The game does try to move away from the grid system, however there is an optional grid you can enable to make your work more precise. While the grid feature does require some touching up to allow for things to be more exact, it still works and helps. The Coaster Builder is also updated to bring a, in my opinion, more indepth and detailed construction process. You no longer are restricted to certain angles allowing you to have a lot more freedom in your design. It will also display data on how your speed is distributed on the track, how fast you are going at a given place, etc. I had a good amount of fun playing with it. Going back to paths, you can also make curved paths this time removing your restriction to blocky pathways. Overall the game plays the same, just with some slight tweeks and updates.Graphics: This seems to be another contested area. The game definitely went away from the cartoonish theme of old in favor of realism. This doesn't bother me too much (Yes, I've played every RCT game. Yes, I understand the style was cartoony in all of them. Sure, go ahead and call me a casual, not a fan, etcc.) The overall user interface looks clean, perhaps not ""super uber professional"" with its art direction like some may desire. However, it works, it looks good, and I like it. A lot of what you would expect out of a RCT interface is there.Overall: There really isn't a whole lot for me to pick on with this game. It is exactly what I'd expect from a RollerCoaster Tycoon game, there are definitely some improvements over RCT3, but there are defintely areas to improve on. I will still continue to play it and enjoy it and definitely looks forward to what will come in the game's future. If you are on the fence of buying this game, do understand this is a work in progress, and understand that it really is not half as bad as people seem to think it is. You will enjoy it nonetheless if you enjoyed past RCT games.			"

Early Access Review
								Just to clarify, this is in early access, there will be bugs, I feel like the PC community would have figured that out already before giving early access games bad reviews because of bugs... ANYWAYS. After having spent the last 6 and a half hours playing this game, I can without a doubt say that this game is living up to my expectations... Having been a fan since the original RCT and seeing it progress to RCT3, a trainwreck of a game, I had high hopes for this game since Atari had 12 years to think and improve. Atari has improved. The interface is insanely simple yet effective, also it has a very slick design to it, props to that. All the editors for scenery, rides, shops, etc... is easy to use and simple. What I love most is the coaster editor. The freeform builder has just enough complexity to it that you may create whatever you dream of, within physical boundaries of course, but it is simple enough and straight forward that basically any 14 year old can hop on here and start building coasters. I feel as though this is finally the game I've been waiting for. RCT3 had some good features to it, like the ride cam for instance, as well as the magnitude of scenery and ride options. When I play this game, I feel like I'm playing a near perfect combination of RCT1 and RCT3 and I am okay with that.UPDATE 07/05/2016:For a good month I have been sitting back and watching how the devs react to all the negative reviews. At first I expected this to be another PC game that the Devs just kind of stick out there and abandon. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. These guys have been hammering away constantly at problems. They have been really transparent and dedicated. In every update log I see where they have read the reports and reviews and put into action a way to fix player's problems. This game is really coming along. If you haven't bought this game and want a finished game, wait another month to buy it. It is really coming along great! Thumbs up Devs! You're doing an awesome job!			"

It is in Early Acces so it may or may not be alot better when it releases.From what I have read RCTW do not have the same devlopers as the beloved titles earlier in the game series.At the moment the game is unplayable, the lag is too much for the game to be enjoyable.The game just feels flat.I hope the devs listens to the community because I really want this game to be good.

								I had to change my review after watching videos on youtube which contained planet coaster.... I don't know what ATARI was thinking... But all I know is that watching the planet coaster alpha reminded me of what I liked about RCT... In fact it reminded me about what I like from all games... That attention to detail, the little bugs that are left unchecked but make the game fun not laggy... the various little bits and peices that you can play about with to make your experience feel more you. RCTW Is a complete mockery of the RCT series and should not be allowed to have the name.			"

Early Access Review
								Confused by some of the reviews on here.  There are top rated reviews that have nothing about the actual game, so I figured I would write my own.My first thoughts 7+ hours into playing this early access build of RCTW are that I am rather enjoying it and cannot wait to see what the devs add on! Here are the pros and what needs work through early access, I'd rather not consider them cons yet as they can be fixed.PROS:Once you spend some time going through the tutorial, building becomes easier and easier.  I had a few issues at first jumping in, but once I took the time to go through the tutorial, most, if not all of my issues were solved and made easier.  The social hub is a nice feature and easy to share blueprints for coasters.  My girlfriend is far better at building coasters than I, and I was able to grab her builds from here.  There were also others in the larger community that caught my eye.  Plenty of talented people out there and awesome to be able to use their coasters.Scenario modes are awesome! I like the variety of different problems the player has to solve in the different scenario options.The U.I. is nice throughout and clean!  Always know where to click for what I want.  No confusion even from when I first started.Game ran well on my Laptop which has a tendency to overheat with most games.  I see people listing better specs than I, but claiming their performance was poor.  Perhaps they should adjust their settings, because I'm wondering how in the world they had bad performance.  There is an occaisonal fps drop, but it was rare.  Probably something that will eventually be optimized by the developers completely.  No where near unplayable as some of these reviews would have you believe.  Trust me, I'm on my laptop. It's fine!Good amount of pre-built coasters and rides.  I expected the early access title would have less, but there is plenty to choose from.  That isn't counting the social hub and custom builds.Options were good.  Can adjust various audio levels, graphics,etc.  There are even options to favor fps over graphics if you should need that for your set-up.Notifications can act as a ""to-do"" list that you can easily clear or X out one by one.  It let me know when there was something I could be doing better in my park.WHAT COULD BE FIXED IN EARLY ACCESS:like with most early access titles, you can expect some bugs.  The main ones I ran into were peeps sliding rather than walking on occaison.  Peeps in general could use more work.  They would have strange graphical glitches within the riding cameras on most rides.Setting theme music on rides could sometimes overlap with other rides' music and create messy music.  I guess in a way it makes sense, but I wish this was more seamless.Nausea levels could be tweaked on the peeps.  Some odd instances where rides or peeps & staff will stop working for a moment.  Fixes itself within a minute or so.Overall, I would recommend RCTW.  I enjoyed the previous titles, and this one is fun and easy to jump right into.  Though in early access, it is more put together than many tycoon games. If the devs continue being passionate about this game and listening to the community, which it seems they will, this will be an amazing title!			"

												This is a great game! The controls are weird to get used to, they seem really touchy, but they physics and mechanics are unbelievably realistic. It definatly plays differently from the previous games (which I played all for hours on end). The spline has helped me re-create coasters from real life. Plus, it is just beta; they have the ability to tweak some stuff and provide a better final product.			"

												Terrible terrible, terrible cmon give me a break! this is total bs its 2016 and you guys wanna  focus on coaster builder in which is a given these days in coaster simulation, it doesnt take rocket science to build a coaster, u could have just added a tutorial in the final game to cover that! why not focus on scenery, buildings, landscaping which will be the main focal point of all parks and how well the scenery lays out and comes together with our amazing coaster creations. this is not ""pre skool"" stop babying us to death and just give us a good product. Cant believe Atari would release a bland♥♥♥♥♥Beta as if we dont now nothing about coaster building we dont care about how well we can lay out a coaster (again) this is basic  mechanics we get it already! Atari you should have gave us a full blown Beta and took feedback across the board instead of dumbing it down like this. What do the stalls look like? do stalls match up with the surrounding enviroment or theme in the area? what do the peeps look like? can we bind objects? (place plants around struts, or next to buildings etc) these are just some of the features i think Atari should have focused on amongst other things as well, but looks like they should have stayed with Frontier because im sure ""PlanetCoaster"" is gonna be insane especially since Atari couldnt capitolized on the labrynth of features and perks RCT3 has let alone CS thats a huge plate to fill and im sure Frontier will bring all that and more to ""PlanetCoaster"" but we will see how well RCTW plays out im not gonna just outright count them out but damn man i expected so much since its ""nxtgen"" but on this day i feel like its R.I.P RCT.

Early Access Review
								A lot of people are ""rating the game"" on an UNFINISHED Early Access game (But its what steam is calling these games). It should be called a Beta really . This might define it better for people thinking this is an oppurtunity to play a finished game before its released to everyone. If u hate buggy games that arent ready, the Beta and Early access games arent for u! It has the makings of a half-decent game, bugs are expected. I have personally played a lot of Betas, test environments and Early Access games. So i expect bugs and report them. Find me one game without bugs, but its already released? lolThe game has the makings of a good new RCT, only updated to 2016. It should become better than RCT3 if it keeps on track and fixes the problems. I could point out lots of the ""bugs"" but that would only put u off, the same as the other negative reviews, Again judging a game on its current state, instead of how great it could be on release. Its not all about better graphics and animations. It is well on track to have better interaction between player and the NPCs (seeing what they need, what they have spent, what they think of your park, etc). It has more shops, rides and a rollercoaster builder (for you to create your own great ride) and custom content, that will be shared on the Steam Workshop between players.If you are worried about its current state, hold off buying, dont read more into the negative youtube videos and reviews, etc. Remember, its about the finished release version 1.0 that you should be concerned with. THEN read the real reviews and pass judgement on the game and then decide to buy or not!			"

Early Access Review
								I typically do not write reviews, however I almost did not buy this game based on all the negative reviews that seem to be stemming from a fan fued between RCT and Planet Coaster. I was worried about the whole 'early access' and if this was even goingt o run properly on my older comptuters. I took the Planet Coaster comments seriously and did look into their product (I'm not sure how it is a 'game' yet... seems more like 'build only' platform which does not interest me) - I'll keep it on my Radar. ANYWAYS - the reason I am writing my review, was I almost did not buy RCTW because of all the mud being flung in this fued. It took several youtube video's to convince me that the product was ready... so here is is..THIS PRODUCT IS WORTH IT - PARTICULARLY IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE ORIGINALS.There is enough working so it feels like a finished product. There are scenarious, multiple (10?+) coaster types, 100's? of rides, etc. The scenery selection is decent, however it is a little light on the themes.The new coaster creator - You can either create a coaster the 'old' way (piece by piece w/ a button editor) or with their new spline based system. I work in 3D all day long, but first started with the 'old' way for comfort sake. In my second park, I only built w/ the new system.There are SOME glittches. Paths sometimes don't want to snap together right, but they will 99% of the time, they just might not be 'pretty'. - they will NOT impeed the play of the game. General sim animation glitches, but again, this doesn't seem to impeed the play of the game.  Food/Drink stands don't snap to the edge of paths, so you need to place them and make a very short path to the path etc. etc. NONE OF THESE ELEMENTS STOP YOU FROM PLAYING!Also, I'm fairly happy to report that so far they do seem to be improving the game w/ updates.ANYWAYS - is you are a fan, and you're getting cold feet based on the reviews from the haters... hopefully this review will help you make a decision to buy. The only type of person I'd not recomend this to is someone w/ OCD that needs their parks to look perfectly symetrically and pretty. That's not going to happen yet. Play for the game itself, or play in sandbox mode to make really really awesome roller coasters. (which by the way you need a hack to use in planet coaster? WTF?)The only thing I may add, is if you're going to have to starve yourself for a week to save up th $50, eat... or maybe eat PB&J and buy RCT3 (assuming it will still run on Windows 10) for the 20 or whatever to get your fix and see where this price will end up - but $50 for a game like this, is not a bad investment.

								I was so excitied for this game as i have loved RCT for many years but this is just shocking! It lags so much that the ""peeps"" arent on the rides sometimes they are just floating. I don't know if you can set it up to allow you to but the screen view will not move with the mouse which can be frustrating. The builder is the worst, yes they have tried to make it more realistic but it makes it so restricted. The on ride views are not moveable so you cant look around whilst on the ride. the constant notifications that ""peeps"" arent happy in sandbox mode just get right in the way. The types of coaster you can have are cut back to a minium, I could go on and write an assay with all the things wrong with this game. This game marks the death of the RCT fanchise			"

								Loading in the game is terrible. It SEEMS to lock up when trying to load anything.  BUT if you play a video on youtube in the background or have anything else that is constantly moving the cpu forward then the game loads and runs like a dream.Paths can be better. It seems that they are too clunky. I want square paths as a design.  Gaining money seems slow too. The alert system is in your face all the time. Slow it down a bit or make the notification smaller.  Let us set an unspecified chain speed. Or lets us hire more than 3 maintence at the start. Even when i had minimal coasters they couldnt keep up with puke. Area to build park should be 3-5 times larger to start with. One time coaster takes up a third of the map. paths take up another....soooo stalls and crap for the other third and you are kinda maxed out.I want a highlight delete tool. A highlight terrain modifier for flat options. Need way more graphics options.  Need a way to set view distance and different shadow qualities.  Will be updating as i see what else. Early access is nice...But the game wasnt even close to done.   Maybe at a beta standpoint.  NEEDS some work with everything. Maybe make it clear that you are going to be spending quite some time on the game. because everyone thinks that you guys might cut and run. They want assurance They want to know that you guys are making the game becasue you are fans too and are not there becasue you have to be. That has to come across. More nuance is needed in telling people what you are trying to do. Not just we are gonna do this Thank you.			"

												I'm a longtime fan of RCT, and have played every version (except mobile), and I've been so looking forward to this beta.  Unfortunately, In it's current iteration, it is hopelessly broken.  Splines are too hard to control so on paths, curbs overlap curbs and you cannot control the angles.  There is also next to no control documentation, so if there is a way to control it, it's not easy to find.  I was hoping it would be closer to ready by now, but 5 weeks away has got to be a joke.  This needs MONTHS of work.  For this to be good at launch, NVIZZIO is going to have to pull a serious rabit out of it's hat.			"

								After waiting a very long time for this game and for it to be released as an early access game was dissapointing but if i'm totally honest I actually really like it! It does need work yes but that is hopefully where the early access comes in, Planet Coaster is going to be a huge blow to RCTW but being a big fan of the originals this is probably the one I will stick with! At this stage the price is a little steep and I can't say it is completely worth it yet but I will say it has huge potential based on its current state so if your a risk taker and are a huge fan of the originals then I would say buy it!

								First of all, i would like to thanks all the dev's and the publishers of the game.I bought it in Oktober for the first béta weekend ever, It's was a horrible bétatesting, but okey, it's just a beta weekend... What do you expect from that, that u can build everthing u want without bugs? Shut the fluff up then. ITS BETA FOR SOMEHOW.Also people are ♥♥♥♥♥ing the game is lagging and glitching as fluff now, ITS FLUFFING EARLY ACCESS. I played for like an hour yesterday and i had fun... Lagg is normal when u are in early access and patience is good for this game NOW.. So why rushing? You make yourself just annoyed as ♥♥♥♥ and gave bad recommends to others.Just wait till the game is coming out before giving idiotic reasons not to buy it.			"

								Let me start by saying I was really looking forward to this game and really wanted to like it, but the developpers should really be ashamed of themselves. Sure it's 'early access', but the game is broken in so many ways. Putting patsh for example just doesn't work. I constantly have to remove old paths just because the new path doesn't want to connect for some unknown reason. or suddenly the terran jumps to the sky, again, for no reason.Graphis are also very underwelming.Stay away till they fix this game or wait for Planet Coaster.

								This game has great dimension. The new stalls rides and park accessories are really nice. The one thing I do not like is how the paths do not connect like the last four games have this makes it more difficult to enjoy since it has to be a degree on or off to work, the delete button and rotate is not the same which makes the game slow down just in doing the shift to rotate. The game takes a while to get used to from the last one. Not sure if I will play this like the prev ones.			"

Early Access Review
								I know the game is still being put together, but i hope it's hardly done because so much is missing. All the features we all know and love from RCT3 like peep designer, etc. are all gone. Hardly a fraction of the flatrides, water rides, pools, coasters, and transport rides are not in the game. The new grid system really takes some getting used to. You can't edit the land square in line with the grid anymore which is disapointing. The peeps walk around with less intelligence than the one's from RCT2. All in all, the game needs drastic amounts of new and old features put into it. I know the cliffhanger ride, the tilt-awhirl, the tumble bug, caterpillar, and the kangaroo have never been in any of the other versions, but id really love to see them in this game. The fact that you cant build custom buildings and walls like in RCT3 makes me angry. I don't like how que line entrances and exits are pre-attatched to the rides. There are so many limits in this game that should be broken through. My imagination is stressed out from running into all these things I can't do which I should be able to. Why can't I build tunnels anymore? On a brighter note, I do love the fact that some of the flatrides left out of all the previous versions are finally in the game, and the newer features such as the variable paths. I will keep this review updated.			"

												AFTER RELEASE:I havn't felt any bugs I felt before+TONS OF ♥♥♥♥ING OPTIONS!And you can build costum buildings so they made that.Anyway I'm telling you - buy this game if you like tycoon games and park games.I didn't play planet coaster although I plan to buy and compare both of them.:)====================BEFORE 18.11.2016Well Met!I think you should buy this game IF you are ready to face a lot of bugs inside the game and face the path system (one of the worst I have seen). Besides that - most of the game is pretty cool, the RC system is great and the graphics is nice.They update the game frequently so I guess it is a good thing as well.One thing that is missing in this game is the customs buildings that you could build in RCT3. I wish they will add it soon as well.Sry for my Grammar. English is not my native language.			"

								Short and sweet; if they fix the pathing issues, add some more scenery options, and allow us to recolor rides (currently you can only change the color of coaster parts)...I'd have no problem fully recommending this. Being that it's still in Early Access, I'm a bit more forgiving. However, by the time the proper release rolls around, if the current issues are still withstanding, then I'd have no qualms about updating my review and recommendation. All in all, do your research about RCTW. Yes, Planet Coaster is all around a better theme park sim as it stands, but it's double the price to buy in to Planet Coaster's alpha. If you're on a budget, and want a new park sim, and can deal with it's quirks, I don't see why anyone shouldn't give RCTW a try. And with Steam now allowing refunds, if you dislike it that much, you can always get your money back.			"

								If you want to play a amusement park game in early access - rollercoaster tycoon world could fit the bill for youIs it early access - yesdoes it have bugs - yesis it unfinished - yesgraphic problems - yes. In short it is early access. But more importantly - is it playable???? Yes it is. Does everything works - no, but enough core mechanichs does.-Path tool is prety good with the exception of a minor bug affecting it-Flat rides can be placed and are in ""working condition more or less""-Scenery can be placed- Coaster - both prebuildt and custom can be buildt. Custom coaster tool is prety good, a little frustrating to figure out, but overall does a decent job.- Economy is in place-Stalls and shops are in place-Didn't test the terrain editor but the button was thereIs this worth your money - depends on you - Go watch youtube or something to figure it out "

												I was looking forward to a new RCT for YEARS, which is why this game is such a disappointment. It looks really pretty but that's really all it seems to have to offer. As many others who played the first ""beta""-weekend says: the coaster editor is a mess. It's hard to use, making cool functional roller-coasters is impossible, nothing really works and building is no fun at all. I really like the concept of spline based building but right now I prefer the old style building as that was FUN.Even if you look past all the bugs that makes your game crash and the loading times that take forever it's still way behind it's predecessors. And calling this weekend a ""beta"" weekend is a bit of a joke as well, as the game feels more like an alpha or even pre-alpha game looking at it's current near unplayable condition.I'm not a big fan of the UI either. The old UI's made the game look fun and it was easy to understand. In this game it feels like they were trying to be ""modern"" and not looking into what the fans liked about the previous games. It's really just SimCity all over again...I did like the terrain editor though. Playing with water is super fun, but is it worth 46€? No.I say that if you really want to try this game like I did, wait for the full relase and listen to what the reviews has to say by then. Hopefully the devs will clean this mess up but I doubt they will in only 2 months of time...			"

								I\'m definitley liking it better than RCT 3. There are a few things i dont like such as the paths and the way the roller coaster track reconnects when you delete, but all-in-all, it\'s a lot better. Smoother graphics is the main thing you would notice if compared to the older games and the free build roller coaster building gives a lot more oppurtunities for building. Also I think the rating needs to be changed. The simplest coaster will have an extreme intesity and very low excitment. Other than that, it is great! "

								I've been playing RTC 3 for hours and hours. Ok it is not the best for now. But it is an EARLY ACCESS. people always want everything in an instant. The point of an EARLY ACCESS (I repeat cause it's seems some will never get it) is to give the game a run in public to get FEED BACKS not HATE BACKS. Of course I know many of you such as me like it anyway. Fact is Haters will hate as always. And those who make me laugh with all the bad review without touching RTC before makes me laugh.- More freedom- Smother tools then the rest of the franchise- A beautiful look like the lights are great- Community content is pretty cool people are really doing great stuff- A dev team that listen to feed back and work their best- Less bulding tools (in progress they keep hadding)- Not much coasters yet but new ones in progress- Huge problem with water tool.. hapened to me to have 1 m of water on the all map... (dig a huge whole till all the water is in it, make it back to groud level till you get one small whole and suck off the water with tool ^^)Can't judge scenario for now not gonna lie, haven't tried it yet. But still  last time ^^ it's an EARLY ACCESS no one got a gun on your head to buy it so why spit on it for free? Anyway if you really like the RTC this one will be tones of fun give it time. You can't build the perfect game in one throw. Mostly a RTC wich is a combination of sooooo much things in one little Amusement park wich can be modify in any possible way. ;)			"

								PLEASE READ FULL REVIEW - Recommended for Early Acces - Maybe will change at full launch. This game is early access. RCTW has had a very rough year. Terrible PR bad Beta launch. However I am not one to focus on the politics and poor issues like that. Let's treat this game for what it is. An early access. So graphics are not usually polised at this point. I will for sure give it a real review and may switch to a NO recommendation for the game when full release hits. After playing a day the game has some nice features to at least start playing around with. If you are not a sandbox fan RCTW already has a campaign mode. You can find the game for around $20 and it is for sure worth that value. If you want to get a look of the game with max graphics settings check out this video. If the game was final release I would not recommend. Now is the time if you want to help mold a game to join in.

								Please note that this is just my opinion... And that I haven't read what they're up to putting into it yet.Pro's:- I love the rides.- I love the fact that now there's actually ''death'' possible when you build a rollercoaster, which makes it more challenging to build one.- You can now move stuff without deleting it first compared to the other RC games.- The campagne is fun, however, I think it'd be more fun if added more challenges to it.Con's:- Even on my brother's game computer it lags. I have one myself, whilst my brothers literally meets all the requirements. It is not recommended for laptops or so unless you got yourself a strong, good laptop(mainly due overheating).- The paths are annoying to place. I tried putting a path from a building to the ''main street'' but it replaced the old path from the ''mainstreet''.- The buildings look all the same, at least for the staff.- I hate the staff buildings. They barely do anything and in RTC3 I really enjoyed the fact you could throw staff in your park and train them etc._I've heard a lot of negative things about RCTW , but keep in mind it's still Early Access. From what I saw, they've improved quite a few things. I see a lot of people saying although Planet Coaster isn't done yet but better. I didn't play PC, and I don't care.Both of them still need to be finished and I'm sure this game gets better as time goes on.			"

If the final release is worst, then I am DEFINITLY getting Planet Coaster.I've been a fan of RCT since the original RCT I was 2 in 2001. One of my all time favorites was RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 because the game supports mods like Amazing Earl's rides like the swimming pool. I was also DISAPPOINTED with RCT4M because the game was like Farmville and had microtransactions to the game and RCT3D because of park limits in-game.			"

Early Access Review
								I held off buying RCTW because of the mostly negative reviews on here. Since buying and playing though, I have enjoyed the game but can see why it has attracted some negativity. I think a lot more work is needed to bring this game up to an acceptable standard but as it is Early Access I am hoping the devs will deliver on their promised improvements, and soon. I have found the game becomes quite quickly boring due mainly to the lack of content, especially park transportation (Devs: please add URGENTLY!!). The lack of flat, water and other non-coaster rides also limits the game severely; I mean, you can only have so many teacup rides and observation towers in a park.The lack of supplied scenery is bad and I have found it difficult to use the workshop items, mainly because a lot of contributors dont proivde any sort of description for their work.  This comment does not lessen my gratitude to the creators of such content for their hard work and generosity in sharing!!The scenarios are somewhat irritating. In RCT3, if you fail a scenario you get another chance in a month or so but in RCTW, if you fail after 12 months, you lose the whole lot and have to start again from scratch. I can usually reach Bronze Level easily in these but then lose everything after the 12 month period has expired when trying for Silver and Gold.I think the animations need some tweaking. For example peeps floating along paths, doors and gates do not open and close with peeps floating through them etc. Small items but important for the overall feel of thepark. Control of park staff is a major issue especially the janitors. In earlier games, I likes being able to assign work areas for staff.I found one ""bug"" that has been annoying i.e. when placing most of the ""upmarket"" restaurants, I cannot connect paths to them. Even on a completely flat sandbox park I get the red error indicator when trying to join paths to, for example, the Ice Cream Parlor and Salad Restaurants (and others). I am fairly sure this is a game issue and not my lack of understanding on placement. Rollercoaster Tycoon and Transport Tycoon were the first games I played on PC and I love the tycoon genre. This latest version of the RCT franchise has quite a way to go but overall, I would happily recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
								These negative reviews are so bias it is insane.... Everyone of them talks about planet coaster,  a game that isn't even out yet but still people talk it up as if they've played it. I will also be getting planet coaster day one but It is not fair to this dev team who has obviously worked very hard on this.. Plus it is early access! I'll start by saying I did not buy this for $50,  I got it for $20 so that definitely helps make it more positive for me and I believe it's important for me to note that. I am running a GTX 980, i7, 32gb ram... I have yet to run into any major optimization issues. I have the graphic settings maxed out,  the game looks great and runs great. I really like the lighting at night.  If you're running on a much older machine and complaining about optimization issues then you just need to stop and git gud. I don't believe half these reviews on here...Many of the negative reviews have less then an hour played on them or they're from the beta..Gamers now a days hate on anything and everything. Seems people can't enjoy anything for themselves, so they jump on the hate train. Its very evident when half the negative reviews have the same language. Its truly sad. When it comes to this,  PC gamers have always been the worst. This is an early access game and for what it is now,  I think its great and is only going to get better. The development team has already posted a day after release about upcoming updates directly addressing players complaints. I hope they plan on releasing a ton of content. Maybe even some freebies for us early access folks. I'm loving it so far.. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first two RCT games. I played a ton of hours on both back in the 90s. I know already this will consume me.👍😊			"

Early Access Review
								There is a lot of negative reviews about rollercoaster world and yes it took me a couple of hours to get used to how the game works, turn rides/shops etc around, but now ive got the hang of it im finding the game quite promising. I think the developers have got the right idea and have done a good job with what they have done so far. Yes its got some issues with gitches and sound and sometimes my people just suddenly freeze but this is early access. I like how much easier it is to build rollercoasters and i like all the personal touches that you can do with them, at the same time im glad theyve kept the pre-made rollercoasters. I also think the detail thats gone into the stations is really good. I was a little unsure about space but after 2 hours of playing i found that this was just me not knowing how to play the game yet, because you can buy more land by going on the terrain tool button, and i found if i pressed the letter n ( i play on my laptop) it allows you to place buildings closer to rides etc. I like what theyve done with the themes, and have been able to make a western and an adventure area with what is available in this early access game. I am looking forward to see what the updates will bring. The only negatives ive found so far is deleting items such as bins, lamposts etc im finding you have to put your mouse in a certain spot for it to highlight. Deleting the trees and bushes one at a time is also a little tedious as i cant find an option to delete a large area at a time, id like atari to look into putting a multi- tool delete option or something similiar to fix this. Ive also found that i cant place rides or anything if theres trees etc in the way without deleting them all yourself and then finding the ride you wanted again so i would also like the rides etc to automatically delete the trees etc for you.  nearly forgot but Im not liking the staff limit, im ending up with lots of staff buildings which only allow 3 staff and the cleaners dont seem to do anything because after placing 5 cleaner buildings my parks still a mess, I see them cleaning but it doesnt seem to make any difference, same for mechanics too. I know there will be larger building available but i can imagine me just having lots of larger staff buildings everywhere. Other than that im happy with what ive seen so far.Since playing further ive had issues reloading a saved game it just crashes saying virtual memory to low to play game, but my virtual memory is fine. Also after being on any rollercoaster every person that comes of is sick which you can never clean up, all cleaners go there so the rest of your park turns into a tip. Also i cant seem to place benches etc on a higher up path.			"

								I pre-ordered this back in September because at that time it said Steam OS... During the first beta weekend they said Steam OS version was coming but just not ready yet. I installed Windows to pre view the game but I hate windows so much I couldn't stand to keep it installed. No big deal at that point because I thought a Linux version was coming.( again I only bought this because it claimed Linux/SteamOS support) Now almost a month after release there is still no Linux version. Further more all reference to Linux/SteamOS has been completely removed from the system requirements.  Even if the game was good I could not recommend buy anything  from Atari. This company should have died with the 2600.			"

								Okay, this game is not finished... by any means Having said that, i am disappointed in the game not for the issues other players are complaining about. i am dissapointed in the fact that by the way the game is at the moment it looks nothing more than a pollished RCT3. I want to be in love with this game trust me. Ive spent too many long summer nights as a kid making the best two demensional theme parks in RCT2. BUT!!! that does not change the fact that this game is still in production and the makers of this game will listen to our requests so yea get the game and if your a long time fan of the original games then have patience and help build the game.

Early Access Review
								So I've put some hours into this game and I already encountered a lot of game breaking bugs. Peeps that get stuck, a complete reset of the peeps in my park, rides not getting fixed while I have no idea why not and worst of all the frame drops and sometimes even the whole game freezing up. It even managed to crash my computer entirely while saving a game. This only occured when my park was pretty big already though.However, the parts that work are really fun. It feels and plays like a next gen roller coaster game, wich is exactly what I wanted. I don't know why everyone is hating on the new coaster builder. It's actually really fun and easy once you get the hang of it. I also really like the new scenery and it makes it that I want to make every inch of the park as pretty as can be. The steam workshop works really well with this game and while there isn't much on it right now I can't wait what people will upload so I can make my park even more awesome.I'm giving the game a thumbs up because I'm actually really enjoying it, even in it's current state. That said, do realise this is not a complete game yet and if you don't want to be part of the ''play-testing'' phase you should wait until they at least patch out the major bugs. Because there are.. a lot..			"

								This game is really good. When it was released there's no doubt it left a lot be desired as there were numerous bugs but having bought the game and played it myself now it is developing into an excellent theme park building game. What is going to go massively in this game's favour is the ease of importing models into this game. Quite frankly the possibilities are endless. The amount of UGC is already quite high and will keep going but it would be nice to see some other tools such as a full map creator. I know you can create scenarios by using terraforming tools in sandbox but nevertheless would be nice to see a map builder. This game still needs some optimizing as well as it can run quite jerkily when on high graphics but seems perfectly smooth on medium graphics. This may also be partly down to my PC although it is quite new. It took a couple of updates to get there but good job Atari and keep the updates and content coming.			"

I have never asked for a steam refund in my entire 3/4 years of of being on steam, this is a disgrace to the roller coaster tycoon series. I cannot believe even with the beta being out this long that it is completely unplayable even when you have 10 GB of RAM and I five processor and an Nvidia 760. You should be absolutely ashamed of yourselves Atari and if you are a fan of the roller coaster tycoon series do yourself a favor and never buy this game unless you want your heart to be destroyed.

								As a RCT fan, I was so excited to play this. I played all of the previous titles of the series and loved every second of them. But when I started to play this, I felt so disappointed.I have a GTX 980. Why am I getting such low framerates with graphics that are so blurry? Take the peeps and workers for example; their textures are pretty hideous. The flat rides flooring doesn’t even match my current path designs. RCT3 managed to do this so why can’t this? I was so excited for the scenarios and when I played them, it wasn’t enjoyable compared to how the scenarios worked in the previous titles. In RCT3 for example; had custom entrances, descriptive objectives on a simple UI objective board. But in this game, every scenario has the same entrance on all three levels with only a terrain change and has simple objectives with ugly white UI. I had to go back to RCT3 and RCT2 and play those scenarios again. I say don’t buy this game now. Wait a few months/year. There are other coaster tycoon games that are currently being developed. Planet Coaster for people who enjoyed Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 (which is in early alpha and it’s prettier than this. However, Planet Coaster Alpha costs £49.) and for people who enjoyed RCT1 and RCT2 there is Parkitect (Alpha cost £15). Those two games are shaping up to be great coaster games. I suggest following their progress.			"

								I was really looking forward to this game. Couldn't wait to try it out. But even though its only an early access at the moment, I'm quite disappointed with it. Even though it has been delayed quite a few times now, it still feels as though not a lot of thought has gone into the game. Like as though they didn't have any coaster enthusiasts to help develop the game.The peeps when you are zoomed out walk like as though you're playing an 8 bit game, the on ride camera doesn't work, due to the fcat that it will freeze on some rides, and the coasters don't have any banked curves when they go round corners. Anyone would know with basic physics that a human body could not withstand those sharp abrupt turns! I know this is only a game, but a game should have more thought into it than what has gone into this. I hate to say it, but it feels like a game for a 6 year old. Like Junior Monopoly!Roll on when Planet Coaster comes out. Frontier know how to make coaster games!			"

								Ok, so they must have made some drastic improvements over the past couple of months because all the negative reviews I was reading is NOT what I have experienced thus far.  Yes, it is early release and there are minor things that need to be added but nothing that is game breaking.  I would like to see more finely tuned staff control (a la rct3) and more flat rides.  I would also like to see the fonts fixed for the park details because its hard to read (its not too small, i have good vision, its straight up hard to read, like missing pixels or something).  I also liked being able to run advertising for specific rides in the older titles, that'd be nice to have back as well.That all said, I love all the new features with the terrain, roller coaster builder, and path builder.  It all works pretty darn well and its way more intuitive and efficient than the previous titles.  I can honestly say that I've put in a good bit of time into this game already and am not tired of it yet.  I need more flat rides to fill out my park but I have confidence those are still coming.This is going to be the best RCT game by far, if they keep listening to the players and continue to fix and release content at the rate they are currently.

								Before I start, I'd like to mention I'm an avid RCT fan.I purchased the game expecting the same greatness every other RCT title has delivered on. I got freeform coasters, paths, and Part by Part buildings, but the lack of a map editor, small parks compared to even RCT2, insane waiting times for the game to load, not to mention the lack of coasters, rides, terraforming, and the like more than cancel out the few promising features. I'll be going back to RCT3P, because a game 12 years old is insanely more fun than this black hole scrap heap of coding.Where's my ability to make custom peeps? Or design scenarios? What happened to the hundreds of different ride types? Even with all nine squares unlocked, the usable area in the park is horrid, even more so when you add trees, hills, vertical cliffs, and water to your already limited build area. I regret purchasing this game, AND the ""digital deluxe"" DLC. If things don't improve drastically and soon, I think I might refund my purchase.			"

												NOT RECOMMENDED! Do NOT buy this.I really want to like this game. The game mechanics are ok, and i really like the coaster builder. There is alot of different things and parks to play with and a quite lenghty campaing.Some stuff is really dull tho, the peeps dont have any real emotions and most of the rides are just plain generic.But the worst thing is, that the game is completely unplayable. It keeps freezing and crashing all the time, it eats all the ram in your machine, and even in empty park, the fps is REALLY low. With my mid-high end pc, ive got max 40fps on medium graphics.At the moment, im at the 3rd, yes, 3rd campaing mission, and i cant get further, as the game crashes already after only 2 rides built.I took a long break, and now, after multiple updates and ""fixes"", i tought it might have been a working game. Nope, it has only got worse.*Edit*Another big problem is with the roads. Even tho the idea behind them is kinda good, they dont work.Either you cant get them to snap, they make weird curves, or they get buried in ground.			"

								I'll recommend it, but I'd wait (from the time of writing this review) about a week, maybe a month for the developers to sort out the issues. It's a graphic-intensive game, so make sure your hardware is up to spec. Lots of issues to figure out still, such as jittery peeps, peeps without some animations, and at one point, I had all of my peeps disappear instantly, but I could still hear them. Give Nvizzio time. It's Early Access, so it makes sense. But props to them on a decent first pass for release. This game holds a very promising future.			"

								This game is really, really far from being good.  The problem is....well....just about everything.  Horrible performance on my high end system, peep animations and peep design, path building, horrible graphics, slow, slow, slow.  Very dissappointing.  The only plus that I can see in the long run is the user generated contect.  Perhaps a year after this is finally released and there is a lot of User Content, it might be half as good as Planet Coaster.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this game.			"

								All the hate I feel is unwarranted. I enjoy it. I can't do half of what I can in rctw in planet coaster early access. They have 4 rides and no coasters at this point. It is early access, it is not a full release. Are there quirks? Yes. Are there quirks in every early access game? Yes.

												I started playing this game during the first beta. It looked good but the coaster Physics were broken. Then Atari went silent for a few months, after the silence the game suddenly went into early access, having broken peeps, broken psychics, broken rides. It ""launched"" just recently out of early access, still with broken stuff. Heck, a registry edit was needed to run the game! Now Atari seems to have abandoned the game again, a hot fix has not been deployed and negative comments on social media or forums are getting blocked, banned and removed. This game isn't worth anything and has killed the good franchise that was once build by Chris Sawyer.			"

												I have to say I can totally see why Planet Coaster keeps being brought up in these reviews. This game has horrible performance and is obviously not very well optimized. Even running this on a system with a GTX 1070, i7-4790 processor and 32 gigs of RAM, this game had really nasty lag spikes everywhere. Even dumbing down the graphic settings to the lowest possible didn't help much while making it feel more like I was playing on a game from the early 2000's. It's just not very enjoyable trying to build a park when you're constantly lagging.Going back and forth between this game and Planet Coaster, the differences are very well night and day. I'm sure some people will side with this game and it's developers, which is fine, but believe me and others when we say, once you play Planet Coaster, you won't come back to this. I know I didn't. I'm really sorry I even bought this, but I guess that's what happens when you don't do your homework first.			"

												I have given this game until 4/14/2017 to wow me.  I bought it in early access excited to finally play a modern roller coaster tycoon.  Sadly this game is missing many things that the older games had and feels like a giant step backwards in gameplay.  Staff managment, coaster building, Path building, and many other gameplay features lack polish and can be very clunky.  I have given this game a lot of time to improve and until now hadn't even considered planet coaster as an option but now I have a serious coaster/park management itch that needs to be scratched and this game simply isn't doing it.  This game was a total misfire by the publisher and developer and to me felt like a money grab to build a cheap knock off of a roller coaster tycoon game to seperate me from my money.  I have played many early access games that have streadly improved over there course to launch but this game although they added features never really addressed some of the key gameplay features it lacks that make for a fun gaming experience.  They have still been releasing updates for it so who knows maybe I'll change this review if they ever truely fix what is broken with this game.			"

First Aweful thing: You cant move your camera with your mouse ... The tutorial only proceeds when being in the foreground. with that it is impossible to open a ride. If you close it, the tutorial doesnt go further. Really really bad. If you want people to play your game once and never again, thats how you do it.What i Have seen of planet coaster looks much more promising than this.At last If u rly want to try yourself, buy a key online, dont waste 45€ on this.

												So I was going to give this game a decent review after playing it for a good 10 hours pre-release of Planet Coaster and its release from Early Access. The game in EA was quite good, not the best game but a good themepark management simulator. Since then it has gone downhill, the framerate somehow got worse through 4 updates and a graphics card upgrade. I'm glad I didn't pay full price and I'd recommend buying Planet Coaster, unless you really want this game.TL;DR - Its a good themepark management game, unoptimised but not a good RollerCoaster game. Buy PlanetCoaster if you want RCT Nostolgia			"

Early Access Review
THIS REVIEW WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY UPDATEDMost recent update; update #11!Since it's release on March 30th, RCT World has been getting eleven updates. Each update added some content, fixed some bugs, improved the game piece by piece. Workshop integration sort of works without issues now, and a blueprint/piece by piece mode, just as in planet coaster (but without the annoying♥♥♥♥♥denuvo) has been added. While Planet Coaster still has a bit more to offer than RCTW, RCTW doesn't use Denuvo, so that's already a bigger plus than any content PC has to offer. And since frontier develops it, I doubt there will be any more support after the final release of the game. Maybe in DLCs. Keep an eye out for RCTW, because it's slowly becoming more and more of a real RCT title. Previous reviewRCTW is developing more and more, some progress has certainly been made in the past few weeks. Almost 2 months have passed since the originial release of RCTW and the game has been improved a lot from its original state. The devs make use of the bugtracker and have fixed most of the more severe and some small bugs the users have been complaining about whilist still adding new features and improving the overall game experience, which is reflected in the community and the content the users have created. It will still take a while for RCTW to become a solid game, but it gets closer with every update. As of now I will still put a ""No"" recommendation on it, as it is not completely worth its money yet.Original reviewRCTW got rushed into early access before it was supposed to, as retailers sold the game before it's release. Thus the current state of the game is rather terrible. It has a bunch of bugs, some more severe than others, workshop integration isn't fully functioning and the performance is rather bad.RCTW adds a lot of new features to the RCT series though. More customization, more user generated content, more park management. The coaster editor now features a node based building system, similar to the one seen in NoLimits, which allows the user to create coasters with more freedom than ever. Of course the ""Piece by piece"" system still exists. Curved paths and grid-less scenario placing allow the player to put more detail into their parks and staff now requires buildings to ""rest"" in.However, the worst thing about RCTW as of now is it's community. People expected the game to be complete and a fully functional successor of the RCT franchise. Of course they got disappointed when the earlier-than-early access version turned out to be.. not so great.Unless you absolutely want it, I'd recommend you to wait and watch the game develop.			"

												Revised review:  A while back I gave this game a thumbs up, even though it had problems because I really was enjoying playing it and it had more content than the competitor, which I also have been playing since Alpha.  They had been fixing crashes and I presumed that crashes would become rare.  Unfortunately, although they have continued to add content to this game, they still have not fixed the crashes.  The last two updates had almost no crash fixes or optimization improvements - only added scenery.  Many times I have worked on a park only to have the game crash and lose all that I had done.  Today I started a new scenario in the story mode (ironcically called Crash Course) and when modifying the initial coaster the scenario starts with the game crashed several times.  Sadly, and reluctantly I can no longer recommend this game and have changed my review to a thumbs down.  The competitor's game (PlanetCoaster) never crashes on me, is better looking, offers more in terms of management now, has a much better path system and has added quite a bit more content over the past few months (plus has over 100,000 workshop items!)  PC also has another free big update coming next week and they are very responsive to player requests and concerns.  ORIGINAL REVIEWBeen playing since alpha.  It's been improved dramatically.  Hadn't played it much since the full release, but decided to play it some more to see if it really deserved all the bad reviews.  I actually had fun playing it.  It has quite a bit of content (which is something currently lacking in PanetCoaster, which I also have had since alpha.)  At the price it is currently at ($35) or less I do think it's worth a buy if you enjoy this type of game.  If you really enjoy BUILDING things in fine detail, get PC, it's beautiful to look at and better optimized.  But if you enjoy laying out a park and plopping prebuild stuff and scenery, this is a pretty decent game.  The coaster builder is actually better in this game than in PC and you're sure to get a good laugh from the animation of the peeps (some are pretty ridiculous, even though they've been improved greatly from early access).  Note: if you want to build bigger parks with many rides you will really need at least 16 gigs of ram.			"

												Maybe the final product will be more put-together, but right now it seems barely playable. Started the game, tried to build one roller coaster and ride the ""coaster-cam"", which then caused the game to de-rail (pun heavily intended). My coaster thrill ride ended at the top of the lift chain, where my coaster cam demounted the roller coaster train, fell to the ground, and then resulted in the screen going black. I couldn't access any more of the game controls so I had to force exit. Not looking good so far - hopefully the final product will get it together.			"

												First off, this review is for the 1st beta weekend, in which the purpose of the beta is to show off the roller coaster builder and to get feedback. After launching the game for the first time, it immediately crashed during the loading screen. That’s definitely not a great start to a beta. The game is riddled with bugs that make the game unplayable. So far, this game isn’t even up to the quality of early-access alpha games by indie developers.Here is a short list of bugs I’ve run into in just the first 2 hours:Clicking a control point on a track randomly changes it rotation values, making it impossible to tweak the coaster without breaking everything.There are memory leaks that cause the game to crash about once an hour.There are occasional crashes during the loading screen.Cars fall through the track on lift chain hills almost every other run.Cars fall through the track of the station as soon as you hit test.Fast forwarding time completely breaks the physics, causing even the slightest turn to throw trains off the rails.The UI for lift chain speeds and booster/break speeds are the size of an ant. You can’t click it, much less read it.The camera controls don’t work while editing coasters, and sometimes freeze up while editing paths, scenery, or terrain.The rotation arrows for track editing are occasionally in the wrong direction.The rotation values of track control points are almost always incorrect, also causes the white, yellow, and red highlighting to be incorrect. You can have a control point that looks like it should be 0 degree, and it will say it is 35 degree.Intersecting paths of different sizes don’t render properly.Wooden coaster supports don’t render properly.Even with the max brush strength, it takes quite a while to fill a small pond with water. That was a horrible feature idea.I’ve already documented 137 more bugs, but I’m just going to leave the list there. Overall, the camera controls and editing controls are too buggy to use reliably, and the coaster editing features of this game are mostly broken.Since this was a beta to demonstrate just the coaster editor, and it is this bad, I don’t expect this game to be out this year unless they hire programmers just to fix bugs. I can’t even imagine how buggy all the other features are of the game. As it is, it looks like they have pushed the release date back again from Dec. 10th to Dec. 29th.			"

												I really love RollerCoaster Tycoon franchise, especially 1 & 2.Are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me ATARI & Nvizzio Creations?Now you're ruining RCT franchise. It's tons of buIIsh!tThere are lots of problems in the game.Coaster Builder, Physics, optimization, and so on.Coaster Builder is very hard to use, Physics and Optimizations are terrible.Hard to watch first-person coaster-cam(it doesn't work well).Trains derail just because of its own supports.Can't devide track pieces after complete the course.Below is my video from beta, watch first 1 minute, 16:25, and 18:20 to check above issues.

Good-bye RCT, and ATARI. You ♥♥♥♥ed up RCT fans.			"

Early Access Review
 UNSATISFYING VERY EARLY EARLY ACCES FIrst of all, I don't consider the game to be as bad as 70% of the community says it is. This review is written a few hours after EA launch, so still, a very early state of the game. The review will be updated as necessary.I see what the devs are trying to do and taking into account the progress since the last beta, they are on a good way. But somehow, I can't quite describe why, this game is unsatisfying. Like, you spent one hour to build an awesome coaster and tweaking it afterwards so the nausea rating would go down, still, 100% of the peeps puke as they leave. Why? Because they don't like my coaster?There is some kind of lack of atmosphere. The peeps are very static in their behavior.I don't say that the way they feel is badly calculated, but instead of displaying annoying smileys over their heads, let them do something.Yes, the game is still very far from being perfect! But EA is what the game needs right now from my point of view. The game is not as bad as 70% negative reviews and seemingly 100% negative since the launch! With lots of effort put into it by the devs and the community this game can be amazing. So be patient, it's the first day of EA and some of the people behave like it was doomsday.			"

												The coaster editor is terrible. I used to spend hours on RCT1, 2 and 3 building roller coasters and I'd enjoy it. There is nothing enjoyable about the new coaster editor at all. Lift hills are massive curves instead of being straight like they are supposed to be. It's difficult to place small pieces of track. It's like you are supposed to draw these massive curvacious parts of track. Just managing to build a wooden roller coaster with a drop and one air time hill was a chore. I built an accelerator coaster but there wasn't even an option to change the launch speed! I couldn't even find the ride camera.  There should at least be an option to use an editor like the one in RCT3 but you're not limited to a 90 degree angle.I'll probably buy it when it's on a Steam sale but I am requesting a refund for the pre-order I purchased. Also the release date was 10th Decemeber. Anyone notice it's been pushed back to the 29th now?			"

								I would like a refund!I came to the view of this game about 6 months ago and I saw the RCT Franchise completly differant. From the pictures and videos the relased it looked so differant. I purchased it today for almost $50. One thought went in my mind ""will this be the same as RCT3... Nah no way!"" but, I was wrong. It is not that differant from RCT3 If not worse! I feel so guilty now about taking the $50 I had and wasting it on this. I would like a refund!!! This game has let out so much false advertising. I sugjust never buying this because of how much of a waste it is.			"

												Be very careful about purchasing this game! Coaster editor leaves so much more to be desired. While the graphics are nice, the movement controls need a lot of work as of the first Beta. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND watching gameplay videos and reading reviews to make sure you are getting the RCT experience you expect.			"

												I feel it necessary to post my own review of this game, which seems to be panned for its inability to run on every PC out there. This is NOT RCT2 or even RCT3. But it IS a nice game with great graphics and a very challenging Story Mode.I am an avid, Longtime PC gamer (25+ years). I've played every Rollercoaster Tycoon game, and loved them. I STILL play RCT3 with my children. I am VERY critical of games that don't meet up to their billing. This new Iteration is NOT deserving of the bashing it is getting.Yes, the computer requirements are steep. If you just meet the Minimum requirements, you will have a Minimum game experience. Don't put this game on the Schlock list just because your computer isn't kept ""Latest & Greatest"".The Story Mode gives you a goal with a challenging start point, and you move from scenario to scenario as you complete the tasks for each level. I like the ""Tycoon Points"" for purchasing new designs/technologies, as it adds more depth than the previous games had. There IS a sandbox mode, where you can stretch your legs and get used to the interface and perfect your coaster-building before wasting a lot of cash in the Story Mode. You can USE the Tutorial in there to walk thru the various elements of gameplay, and learn just how different it is from previous RCT games it is.Ther may ber a few, minor hassles like dropping a mechanic at a broken ride, then watching him walk completely away from it just to go check on a working ride. But that doesn't warrant a Terrible review.My recommendation: Test Drive it for yourself. Steam guarantees your satisfaction, right? Purchase and play it for an hour. That will let you see if your PC can run the game. Plus, it will give you a quick look into the interface and the Story Mode. If it sucks to you, get your money back, but don't go Flaming it on the reviews. "

								Don't buy this. Really, a waste of 10 months of waiting, and $50, use it to buy something good. Extremely laggy. This game is this:Atari was constipated and pooped RCT3, then they left it out in the sun for 10 days, then Nvizzio went and ate it and pooped it out again, then waited 10 months, then released RCTW.And that's being NICE.

												Even though the game is in beta stage. It definitely needs alot of work. The track editor is brilliant but it takes time to get use to it, but if perfected will be beautiful. This game has alot of potiential, they really just need to polish it up and it could be a great game. Atari should not release this game until next year. Give it at least six more months of work and testing and polish and add more content for initial release and this could be a beautiful rollercoaster tycoon successor!			"

												As someone who played RCT 1, 2 and 3 multiple times I was very excited.In the current state the graphics are not that great compared to RCT 3.The coaster design tool is not properly streamlined and thus makes it very difficult to build a roller coaster. I understand that this is a Beta version, but the could have atleast made this part a bit better,I feel like they tried and make it more like Themepark Studios and failed!!!It does not feel like an RCT experience at all.Eventhough its advertised as a Beta, it felt and seemed more like an Alpha version and as such has a loooong way to go before it can be released.The best part about this Beta is that Steam refunded me the price :D			"

												RCTW has the best roller coaster editor in all of the games in the series. Unfortunately, that's about the only good thing about this game.CONS:> The grid placement does not align properly with coaster tracks which is very jarring.> Furthermore, most of the ploppable scenery assets DO NOT ALIGN properly with the grid placement. It is very difficult to create a field of flowers, for instance.> Frequently crashese when using the bulldoze hotkey.> Game Speeds do not have hotkeys. This is unacceptable.> The fences are the most badly designed aspect of this game.> No stairs. Pathways just magically incline to the next one.			"

								I got the game and played 11 hours, and I actually was enjoying the game until the game started freezing.  I had 4 save files, all for the same campaign I was playing and when I would load the game it would load and then freeze not allowing me to play any of my saved games.  I'm not willing to invest my time in a game that can glitch, making all my progress unplayable.  Atari, you should be ashamed of yourself releasing this trash onto loyal customers.  After this experience I will be jumping boat to Planet Coaster and I'll never buy another Atari game again.  With a glitch like this you should not have put this game on early access. I believe you have killed this game and the people hate it.  I've played tons of early access games and I've never lost my progress or been unable to load my save files.  Buyer beware, go check out Planet Coaster.  I got a refund for Tycoon World but what I really wanted was to access my saved game that I had 11 hours invested into.  To lose my progress and the fact that a glitch like this exists is enough to turn me away from all Atari games.  Shame on Atari for releasing this garbage.  I'm running a i7 4.0ghz processor, 8gb of ram, and a gtx970.  I should not have any problem playing any game on the market.  11 hours of my time into a campaign I can no longer access...well F@@@ you Atari.			"

I still expect them to do more with a title like this but thats what happens when a completely different team works on it. In before GO PLAY PlanetCoast: I already have. Its got too many goofy things that I dont like that distract me... such as spending more time laughing at people as they walk through flames, water, and electricity instead of actually trying to build a park.

								I've played all the Roller Coaster tycoon games over the years. This one is a bit tricky at first. Expect to spend a few hours understanding how to make your first coaster unless you get some tips. This is more of a guide and review at the same time. Here are some tips. :)Expect a little frustration building your coaster at first. When building your coaster:  Hold down the shift key, and use the mouse wheel to move it higher or lower. After you click on a peice of the track in build mode you can drag out that track and make curves, etc. and press 1, 2, 3, or 4; all these numbers do different things. Then you use your mouse wheel and to adjust. One of the numbers lifts up the track on one side for example (press 2, and then use your mouse wheel for example).Also the camera is a bit quirky. You can go into options in the game, general, turn off auto focus coaster when building (so it doesn't jump everytime you click on the track), turn off auto zoom out camera if object is to large, and change your camera field of view if you like.Also the graphics can be improved; changing them is a bit quircky. This is done by pressing escape, options, graphics, turn off better fps over graphics.. This makes the graphics settings go lower for some reason though. You then need to adjust higher the other settings AFTER you select this.Placing a ride or object: Hold down the shift key, and use your mouse wheel to turn it around before you place it.Adjusting the size of the map: Click modify terrain, and you'll find the option to expand there.Also when you place a janitors building for example each building is used to hire the number of janitors for that building; differnent than RCT3.This is a great game, but I think the issue is most people aren't taking the time to go through the tutorial. In addition to that the coaster building is a bit advanced; you can do a lot with it, but the key will be the first few hours.For beginners it's a bit tricky. Is it fun? Yes it's a lot of fun to play. I'm enjoying my park the more and mroe I play it. The more I play, the more I want to play. It starts out slow and grows on you once you figure out what your doing. It's also fun to decorate/improve the park.The graphics are pretty nice as well. I'm looing forward to this game growing, but as for now it's a good game if your willing to read a guide like this one and others you'll be fine. :) Also if you enjoy a challenge on coaster building you'll like this game. Expect a lot of crashes during testing, but it's gratifying and realistic.. You adjust angles of track to compensate, etc. It just feels nice, and it's a good sandbox style game.There are a good amount of rides, and park finances.Why are there bad reviews section: Most people don't understand the options they have at their disposal, and haven't read the tips/guides on controls. Changing the graphic options, and adjusting the camera are all fairly easy to do once you have read these trips. I have experienced some crashes for example when making a huge roller coaster with lots of turns, etc. I'd say save every so often in case, but the coaster build is pretty fun once you get the hang of it. The game is itself seems to run pretty smooth though on my system; a 980 GTX, 16 gigs ram, and a 3.4 ghz quad.The problem is if people didn't get it within 1-2 hours many immediately went for the bad review/refund option, but this one is worth digging deeper and playing imo. :)			"

								This game is alright and has potential, but it should look back some of the other games for improvement. Maybe im missing a couple features, but I cant be sure. I didn't play rct3 because It was kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Just a note: One of the rides is broken, the one that is supposed to swing the guests with the whole seating mechanism spinning (I cant remember the name). It sits at the top and does not release and just spins at the top of its rotation. Reccomended hardware: Any mouse with an infinite scroll wheelThe one thing I love more than anything is the roller coaster design and the application of mechanics within them (though making loops and♥♥♥♥♥♥is hard).  The path building is also cool, but I never use the curved pathways because they never seem to work or let any other paths snap. You should also allow for automatic scenery destruction when creating the coasters, placing pre-mades or at least expand the destruction to only destroy scenery in xy range. Things I hate are the laggy experiances you get which you can only assume is due to a memory leak or soemthing else. The buildings are cool, though I hate the fact that you need to place a path for each and every one is really annoying. This is one of those features im going to test later with the grid snap and see if that helps out at all. The default station platforms are limiting, but the use of the brakes is a more realistic (and maybe better?).I hate hate hate the use of the word ""peeps"" and how the ""peeps"" thoughts don't stack. This is something that is absolutely needed. Also the use of the words People or Guests looks better. Is this game worth $60 right now?

												This is a review for the first beta.  The game is broken on a fundamental interface level.  Building a coaster is maddening, not because it is a challenge, but because the interface is broken, poorly thought out, poorly executed, and clearly not even close to prime time. I'll revise this on future betas and upon final release (in about a month...I hope they can fix this mess in time...it seems infinitely unlikely).  Right now, I regret pre-ordering even though this series is probably my favorite game.			"

There is a good amount of content and hopefully this will continue to be added to in future updates.You can design your own roller coasters and test them.

								Will do a full review in due course as I've only just started playing. Thoroughly enjoying it so far, yes there are things they need to fix but I've had no problems (yet!) and it's a really awesome game- the people rubbishing it aren't doing it justice and the devs keep responding to beta feedback so it keeps improving. Could yet prove a worthy addition to the RCT legacy. Some great rides for your parks too. Overall I'm optimistic for the final version of the game, they are putting lots of effort into improving things so it's cooking nicely.			"

								I'm really happy with this game! After reading some of the previous reveiws I was unsure about getting it but I'm glad I did. Maybe some more updates have been done since previous reviews because I havent come across any bugs yet and the graphics are great. There is a good amount of content and hopefully this will continue to be added to in future updates.You can design your own roller coasters and test them. Thats really fun :P Also the layout and design of scenery is quite customisable.I have played previous roller coaster tycoons and loved them and I'm very happy with this one too :)			"

								So I want to say a few things about this game really quick. First of all I have been a player of this series since RCT1 was out, I've had most of my hours in this series played in RCT2 but I've still played countless hours of RCT3. This new game has put a very sour taste in my mouth and it seem to have done the same for many other fans of the series. but looking at tis game as it is, it isn't awful. The textures and movement of the peeps are my biggest complaint and the pathing isn't very smooth and needs to be fixed. but other than that, this game has a monetary system and scenario and well made terrain deformation and water(even though the water doesn't look very good), It also doesn't run great but the just means it needs to be a little better optimized which is usually the last thing a developer does in a game. This game definetely has some things it needs to fix, but if they can tweak those few things, it'll be a pretty good coaster tycoon game.TL;DRThe game has graphic issues and looks a little weird, but it has potential to be a good game			"

								I get why people are upset..but i think this is a great game with room to become amazing! they made it early access for a reason and were very upfront about bugs. People keep making comparisons to planet coaster. although I have not personally played the game, i have watched alot of vides of it, and it has its flaws as well just like rctw, but planet coaster is like 75 bucks to play it now! planet coaster aside, i just think that alot of people are being childish and bashing atari and rctw. Ive read reviews saying its unplayable....i by no means have a beast pc but it plays just fine with no lag or long loads or anything like what ive read. so for me personally i am thrilled to finally have this game, and am looking forward to future updates and watching this game grow!

Early Access Review
								A rather negative, but recommending, review that isn't ""helpful"", despite stating all the game's current flaws (that I have found).Enjoy.I've been playing RCT games since the beginning; way back in the 90s. Y'know, the days of Chris Sawyer? (pre-lawsuit, of course)Keeping in mind that this game is early access with said early access having been pushed back for months and months by the publisher due to quality control... well, the quality here is, at best, mediocre; probably not worth the wait.Personally, I really dig the game. It's keeps me amused while I have free time before or after work, but I'm unsure if it has that same vibe as any of the previous RTC games as of yet.The graphics are ""prettier"" than its predecessors, but not optimized in the slightest. At this time, it's remarkably limited (due to early access). Given just how much the early access was pushed back, I did expect a little more refining on what the devs said they had been working on. It feels as if they left some things unchecked on their to-do list.In it's current state, it doesn't even remotely stand up to what RTC3 was, or even the original game (yes, even without expansions, this game could not stand up to it). The graphics and animations are janky, completely incomplete in comparison, though I highly respect the attempts at a more realistic look. Glitches are, obviously, numerous. The controls are offputting to me, but that could just be because it's a new game. My computer, which though isn't amazing, should be able to play it no problem; the optimization on this is currently horrid to flat-out nonexistent (keeping in mind that this is early access and many tools, bits, and bobs can't be fully optimized without tests; it doesn't make it any less annoying to a player [even in early access]). The game will freeze while trying to load a scenario and most campaign maps. For me, it can only load up sandbox mode and the first campaign map without trouble.Due to it's early access state, there isn't much of a campaign mode nor scenarios. If you can't get them to load like me, there's even less of a selection.The delete tool is sort of atrocious; since you have to play on low quality, you have to zoom in to kill some azaleas (sorry, flowers) before you can even build a ride. Yes, you can apparently build through trees no problem, but save the flowers! You can't build over paths if you decide that you like one more. You have to individually delete each path section and then rebuild your chosen path. Individually. Delete. Path sections. Or individually delete trees. Individually. I was hoping for a click'n'drag, delete all the things, KILL IT ALL mentality as it would make clearing an area less annoying. The path issue was fixed in RCT3 with that path tool, but even then you could only individually delete plants and rocks (or have I missed something?)Path building itself can be a bear. Sometimes it says you can't connect paths, but I rarely ever see the reason why. Unfortunately, with each path being a ""bone"", you can't always add another bone to it. Even though you may just be making the spine longer.While I really dig the coaster builder (I think this will always be considered the ""best"" part of the game, even in a completed state), it is incredibly awkward to use. There's multiple tabs, which I don't mind, but they make it seem clunky. (Though having it all together would probably be even worse). I feel like the coaster builder from RCT3 was far more refined and usable. It didn't give me a headache. But I also couldn't have made the amazing tracks I can now.For paths and coaster tracks, you can move the mouse wheel to rise or lower the pieces. Unless there's some sensitivity thing I'm missing, this is very slow.You now have staff buildings rather than just hiring staff. And, as of right now, you can't change their outfits. Not even for the entertainers. So in my normal park, instead of having a black'n'white panda like I would in RCT, I get blue and white (which is the ""normal"" panda for RCT) and. Wait for it. Aliens and owls(I think. Wtf is that thing?). I don't even know what else. I liked having my natural pandas, black leopards, cheetahs, and lions in RCT3. Minor complaint, and probably something that will be implemented later so we don't have owl things walking around in a space themed park.Fortunately, it is early access. Most of this should (hopefully) be fixed in the future.Despite all it's negatives, I currently really do enjoy the game, apparently having been playing RCT games for over fifteen years. I still play RTC1-3. But unfortunately, like I said, it doesn't stand up to these.But, for what this game is, it is enjoyable as a long-time fan. I don't see myself playing a ton of it as of yet given the number of issues and the fact that the older games simply are better right now. I'm just hopeful that there's no more push backs and that the devs stay on it.While I do recommend, I honestly suggest holding onto your money for just a bit (maybe another update or two) unless you remember the days of old and bare-bones 1990's games and don't mind that sort of thing. At this state, it is not worth the money, confusion, or irritation for most people. That being said, I personally do plan on playing the game every now and again while complaining about the weird controls all the way.However, I hope the devs know that I was willing to spend my money in the name of RCT and publisher (Atari) in hopes of a good future game.

								After playing the game i must say i love it. I feel like the developers undertook a great challange in making a game, as Rollercoaster Tycoon has such a great reputation. But i feel like they did well dispite all the negative reviews. I have played every Rollercoaster Tycoon game. In my opionion i feel like the developers should add a feature where when your building a rollercoaster you can have a option to see if the coaster will have enough speed to make it over a abstical your building. I would find myself having to wait after i select the test coaster button, i would wait for the coaster to finally get to the part where i would be tweaking or fixing to see weather it would fail or pass. You should be able to have a option to select where the coaster would start. That way a player would'nt have to waste time watching the coaster go over the entire track just to get to a part your modifying			"

								As most people I have been waiting for this game for a long time and have been a long time fan of the RollerCoaster Tycoon franchise. There have been and still is lots of teething problems with RollerCoaster Tycoon World, but to me that is fine.I am just glad to see that there is now a new game, and that hopefully it will updated to make it even better. This has some great features e.g. peep cam and has got a great community behind it. It is still in early access so of course there is going to be bugs, graphic problems, performance issues etc but that is what you get for playing an unfinished game.I am looking forward to the future updates, content and hopefully more and it is well worth buying it right now.

								I've been a long time fan of the RCT franchise since RCT1. I was very excited about the RCTW project ever since I first heard the news that there was finally going to be a sequel. RCTW delivers everything you would expect in a modern RCT game. The greatest improvement of all is the absence of the grid. Everything in RCTW is placed and manipulated in a real time 3D environment. The Coaster Editor is the next biggest improvement. Gone are the days of piece-by-piece track building. In it's place, we have a powerful spline editor that makes creating coasters more advanced than ever before. It's entirely possible to build a track piece at any angle imaginable. And thirdly, we have an sphosticated UGC system in place to guarantee that players can create, share, and place virtually any kind of scenery object right into the game. I feel that my top needs have been met so far by RCTW and the project has a very hopeful future ahead. I'm very pleased to be a part of the experience and I'm excited to see this project carry on the legacy of my favorite theme park sim franchise.			"

								I know this is beta and I really was looking forward to it, but I deinstalled it. I hit the minimum requirements for this game and it is almost impossible for me to do anything in there, because it's much too laggy (when it even starts).Loading the game takes ages (it says ""can take several minutes"" on the loading screen - so it's not me). After playing the series and all add-ons from the beginning, it is surely hard to learn everything from scratch again (e.g. building coaster tracks). But maybe it is nice when you learned it finally.Worst of all is the WASD movement. I want to scroll with my mouse and not with the keyboard. This is no FPS.You can't get into the game options yet, so I have no idea if I can make a better performance with turning the video quality down.To make it short: I can't recommend this for people with old hardware. But finally I have a reason to buy a new one now. -----Edit (20th Oct 2016)I got a better machine now and it's running more or less smoothly. There has been much work done since last year and the game is growing. But my main con is the movement. Why are you able to turn the map with the mouse wheel, but have to move with WASD? That's so far the major reason for me to stick with the ""rival's"" game, which is developing parallel to this one.			"

Early Access Review
								I am actually quite enjoying the game! I dont seem to have nearly as much trouble building a great looking park and making everything work as some other people claim. There are some visual bugs, the crowd simulation could be better and I've had the occasional crash to desktop, but overall I can obsess for hours just placing fricking vegetation, trashcans and whatnot (try the snap/grid options for object placement) but the object rotation feels a bit slow. I've built some insane coasters (of which there are many types), checked out a multitude of charming rides and there is actually a ton of variety and content out of the box. Whoever complains about things looking similar, has probably only looked at food and merch stores. I've unlocked 5 out of 9 tiles for the park size (which is already quite massive) and I am able to create visually diverse and themed regions (sci-fi, western, adventure or generic). I can also sculpt and paint terrain to create mountains, or even fill valleys with water to create lakes and islands. You just need to progress for a bit and unlock the campaign obectives and you will have more content than you can shake a stick at. Or play sandbox. Game is pretty underrated and addictive if you ask me and people are being quite harsh in their reviews. If you can pick it up for a decent price, give it a shot. PS: you can kill peeps with coaster cars launching off track. Good times.Edit: Now that my park is growing, performance seems to suffer more and more, even on very high end gear with max settings and I get some serious fps drops. I tend to now pause the game when building to alleviate that. Hope the devs can improve that before the full release.			"

								I had a good time playing this.  I played the first 2 RCTs and expansions whay back on thier release and i had such a good time with those ground breaking games.  They were easy to figure out and enough detail and options to keep the entertainment value and replay-ability alive to even this day for many still.  Its a tough job modernizing those yet keeping the same simplicity.  I will admit that even going through the tutorial on the first coaster build, I was slightly getting frustrated...but...it was my first time.  I know eventually it will get easier and if i dont feel like making one then i will just use an existing one...just like i did with the earlier games.I would recomend this to people who get into this type of game, and the ones who don't will just have to sit quietly and listen to me talk about it...because i had a good time playing it and i will put many-o-more hours into it. as far as early release bugs and glitches.....the only thing i noticed in the first couple hours of playing was that when i zoomed out a bit, some of the rides would spin incredibly fast...to the point it just looked crazy.  you can tell there still needs to be some fixes but its definately playable....and fun!one more note:  i would like to see and option for a simple path build.  maybe even a button that will straighten already built paths in accordance with a grid.  maybe highlight an area and snap all paths to make them straight.  maybe that is too hard to program...but would be nice.  Then again...maybe it is there and I didnt see it yet....guess i should get back to playing.			"

								to be fair i agree with a lot of the negative comments but it's not like i'm giving up on this game because i like it a lot.like many others i grew up with rct and this one is on it's way to become the best, but it's not there yet.i was really enjoying it, there were a few bugs and the path placing is indeed unfinished but the gameplay itself, i like a lot.the major problem is, i placed a lot of rides end scenery in my first park and now i game is unable to run that save file, it crashes right after it is loaded.if you are a rct fan, buy it but maybe wait till when the game is on sale if that is even pssible because it's an ok start but they have a long way to go and it is too overpriced atm.6/10 so far, just hope they are making progess in fixing things			"

												This game would be a lot better if it didn't crash every twenty minutes.  This game is in desperate need of an update to fix the bugs. Memo to the game developers, skip the upcoming release of new  in game content and focus on eliminating the crashes and bugs. As it stands this game needs help!			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game for my wife. While it isn't quite everything I had hoped for in this long awaited installment, it is still playable and we look forward to the updates and changes to come. My wife finds herself losing track of real time while playing. She's not the biggest gamer, actually, not a gamer at all so if this game can capture her attentionand I know she looks forward tothe next time she has freetime to play then to me it was worth my purchase. I have watched her play and I myself think that while there is still plenty of room to improve, it does look nice and for the most part operates fairly smoothly. The ability to place buildings facing nearly any direction is a nice feature because in previous installments choosing one of four directions became relentlessly boring. That being said, it would be nice to have better graphics options. I realize this game is more for a common crowd with average machines than it is for the game enthusiasts but it would be great for the game to make use of the available resources on upscale machines.So, keep in mind, while this has been a long awaited installment in the franchise, this is still early access and there are going to be glitches and room for improvement. The only way to help shape the game the way you want it is to play, and provide feedback in the discussionboard for the developers.			"

												Edit: 29 februaryNothing new. New screenshots etc have been released - but no dates on either Beta 2 or Release date... Im getting bored and tired.This game got be so awesome when its out. If its ever coming out... My hopes; Will be out before Planet Coaster, which is set to be released Q4 2016Ill go back to bed, cya.-----Edit: 11. january:So, we havnt heard a word since early december. Was promised two beta weekends, got one - and the other one got delayed - but as said: We havnt heard a WORD since the ""happy holiday"" where absolutly nothing was said.Hmmmmm...-----So I spend 2 hours playing the game tonight and here is my thoughts:I started with the plants, benches all that jazz. Built a nice path to start with, and start placing objects. The first thing that got on my nerves was, even though you promised a non-grid game, everything snaps to everything. The radius of snapping to path is HUGE. You cant even place fences along a curved path.Right, so we had to test the coaster physics. So after I played around with the tools to build it, I restarted and got seriously. I tried guys, I really tried! I got 1 coaster to work(!). That working coaster had one drop and then it ended. I tested it 4 times and 3 times it crashed while being dragged to the first drop.. I mean... It was a straight rail, and it just fell off.Now, the controls and the way the coaster builder works is just hard to figure out... What does the colors (black, white, red, yellow) means? It doesn't mean that, when its red, it cant go that way.. Because it can... sometimes.That being said - its a beautiful game with a lot of potential but I have to say this.. You won't make it to the release date, unless you're having a WAY different version than us. I really don't get how a bunch of developers can sit at a table and agree on: Guys! We release this beta so people can see how awesome it is..!I'm sorry for the negative thoughts - but this was really 2 hours of total frustration. Ill look into this, when we hit release, but for now- its not going to happen.I wish you the BEST of luck - and I hope this game will come out and BLOW us away... I love the franchise, please make it happen. Thank you.			"

												So it's a theme-park type game, and even the paths don't work. You'll find yourself unable to place a path connection along a path that is as long as a big thrill ride is wide, and you can't place a path. Unbelievable that they actually released this. If you can't even get paths to work, I'm sure you can imagine how much else is completely broken in this game.			"

Early Access Review
								D I E  H A R D  F A N  H E R E.I have been waiting for RCTW to release and finally get my hands on. To be honest I had struggles if I should give the game ago- I have read negative reviews different platforms and I was worried it would be a disaster; now I have tried the game and I have the following honest feedbacks:I started the series since RCT1, enjoyed RCT2 and loved RCT3.I do honestly hoped that RTCW, 10 years after the release of RCT3 would have been sculpted and upgarded much and have noticed the followings:PEEPS.peeps look terrible in RCTW. I would zoom in RCT3 and just look at happy peeps buying balloons/popping their balloons etc but now I just want to zoom out because they look like zombies. In my opinion, they need more life.ROADS.honestly think its a nice touch for the shift/scroll to lower/elevate ramps, it was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to calculate how much angle the ramp for older version. I think this gesture worked. Nice touch for adjusting road widths/ but it is difficult to connect wide roads to attractions/facilities or back to a single sized road.COASTER BUILDER.ok. I have read lots of bad reviews for the coaster builder. After I tried it out myself, I think it is not as bad. The control might NOT be for beginners/new RCT players, but if you were an EXPERIENCED RCT player, I do think the mechanical tool option helped A LOT, esp. to add chained/brakes tracks in a clear manner. I think the tool box is quite neat to me, but I do understand it may cause beginners a lot of confusion.WORKERS. (JANITORS/TECHNICIANS)very nice touch. to just add a hub and let them manage themselves. I dont care if they slack tbh. I just dont care.RESTAURANTS.interesting blend of food and specialities restaurants- but I think the designs are a bit lazy for different themes, and I hope they could be attached to paths at a closer distance. (and i do secretly enjoy the fact that you can manage the amount of sauce/salt/edit the menu in RCT3)Shift+mouse scroll to rotate: i prefer a 90degress rotation in default than the default scroll-till-you-get-the-perfect-angle mode. saves my time. and some players (me) still prefer doing plannings on grid.Snap tool is a bit off - somtimes I misplaced benches outside the path and I dont like it.better to add a drop down menu- to filter themes. showing 4 burger shops in a row with different themes is not kool.TERRIN TOOLS.brilliant.ATTRACTIONS.I MISS THE SWAN BOATS AND METRO TRAINS TO TOUR AROUND PARK.STATISTICS.very clear way of presenting, loan is reasonable. SPECIAL LOTS.I appreciate the plaza blocks that are saved as pre-made blueprinted, saved me a lot of time and they are done beautifully.I MISS THE OPTION TO RE- PLACE ENTRANCE/EXITS. sometimes the location is just not right.CONCLUSION.I think. for 10 years, the game does not evolve as much as I expected it to be (thinking about from RCT2 to RCT3 guys.... the sudden leap from axonometric cubes to first person camera view on rides. thats innovation.) except from the fact that you can change the graphics settings to ""very high level of detail"" and ""very far detailed shadow"". This is not a rendering software, and high level of renders always make the game slow/crash. I would appreciate if more effort is put into details (design of rides) and new gameplay experience (like soak and wild for RCT3). It also remided me how great RCT3 is... especially at that time. I have a neutral feeling for this game, I remained nostalgic about the old days I spent managing my park, so YES I recommend for long-term RCT players, but maybe a NO for beginners.			"

Early Access Review
								I personally (i know i am going to get hate for this) dont mind the game. Its okay... not great but okay. It does lag alot and there is alot of problems with it such as guests floating in mid air but overall, guys its an early access. Yes it should be alot further than this but hey, they havent got that far yet clearly. Ive played from Rct2 to this and i will admit it seems a bit of a step down with overall game performence. However, the new variation of rides is good.  I wouldnt say it is worth the money at the moment maybe $20 or so not $40.One thing i am dissapointed about however, is in the flags part of the scenery (dont remember which sub-category it is in) there is no australian flag. There is basically every other flag but Australia. I find this a bit offensive as i know alot of people who do play this series and have for  a long time. Why not put our flag in there to? Atari, how could you not put us in there with the others? I know we aernt huge like America or anything but still, it would be nice to see the Australian Flag at least.Everyone who is hating on it, get over it people. They aernt perfect. Yes, as i said previously there are ALOT of problems. But the new features like new coaster mechanisms (boosters, friction brakes) is cool. The main problem i have noticed is lag. It takes a fair bit of time to load a saved game or even start a new one and when in it, it tends to lag quite a bit to the point where guests float or you cant move around the map. The coaster builder is definetley a step up from previous versions. It is a bit confusing at first to use but after a couple of times you adjust. I will admit however, the variation of special coaster parts such a helixs and loops and twists is alot more limited in this game. Overall this game is OKAY. I would recommend it simply because it has potential. (in my opinion) It is still very buggy and laggy however.  If you have patience to wait and play through bugs and a bit of lag, buy it. If not, dont buy it. Simple.  "

								This game is HORRIBLE. It's not worth 50 dollars, not even 10. This isn't early access - this should be pre-pre-alpha. The game is just so laggy even on the LOWEST graphics settings. There's basically no customization. You can't change colors of flat rides or anything like that.Please do yourself a favor and go for Planet Coaster, Parkitect, or RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. I recommend those games SO much more then I'd ever recommend this.			"

								You can obviously tell that it's still in development, but what they have already is amazing! It took me a bit to figure out the roller coaster building tool but now I'm in love with it! I have so much control over the building of a roller coaster and it's easy to do it as well. I feel this game is great in this early access state, and it's only going to get better with all the promised additions and changes. The developers are keeping their word too by working on the problems and bugs that the community point out. Keep up the great work! This game is headed straight for pure awesomeness!			"

												This coaster builder needs serious work, I am very concerned that at this stage it is faulty and difficult to use. Although the designer has much more potential, it is tedious to use like No Limits. This doesn't bother me at all as I like the idea of having so many options, but I'm not sure if it fits the RCT style. A controls/direction guide would also help, and I can't seem to be able to create straight lines?Please fix the designer before launch :(			"

Early Access Review
								Im loving every single minute of it, glad I bought it, only *issue* ive run into is when the park reaches 2,000+ peeps, the lag is unberable, and it crashes. Other than that I enjoy customizing the cars for the coasters or the colors of the paths or que lines. I enjoy the fact that the peeps have a mind of their own. Some dont like to ride certain rides, some only like roller coasters.The Coaster Builder. - Took me alot of time to get used to, forgetting to use shift to make it rise, or tilt. I enjoy the fact that some coasters can spin, reminded me of *Thrillville off the rails*.I enjoy the fact that the mascots seem to make everyone happy. I also enjoy that there are SO MANY differnt food buildings, theres like 4 different buildings just for tacos and salads!!!One thing that I really really enjoy is that I can ramp the paths, like, I made a little river, so I boosted the path up to go over the river, and I put a wooden rollercoaster track under and over it, so My peeps can enjoy a good coaster on the entrance of the park. The performance isnt 10/10, nor is the FPS, but it is playable....Im surprised my FPS lasted pretty good with the ammount of items and peeps in the park, there were around 1,800 peeps in the park and over hundreds of differnt pieces. 6 Roller coasters spread out all over. 60+ food buildings, 8 mechanic buildings with 10 mechanics for each building. 5 entertainer buildings, once again 10 entertainers for each building. 9 Janitor buildings, 10 janitors for each building. atleast 80 plants and trees, a lake, and over 10 thrill / family / and Junior rides..... Peeps arent to bad, yeah they walk through each other, but eventually theres so many peeps in your park you dont even notice it. Peeps - 8/10Id rate the game 8/10Path Placement - 7/10---------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATEDIve had enough with this game, the first part that got under my feathers was. I was at a halloween party in october of last year, got home got on youtube and saw this game. I thought OMG this game looks amazing, looks so awesome. Said the release was DEC 12th and that was right around the corner!!!!!! But then that Beta weekend came up, and I started watching gameplay videos and stuff and I mean almost every youtuber that had a gameplay video for this game were just HATING on this game.... Looked at the steam reviews (Atari should have never opend the reviews up for the beta testers to enter their reviews) it went downhill quick, there were a few good reviews ""From kids that had hope"". The rest were just negative nannys. Watching the gameplay for that beta weekend I knew immediatly that the game was just NOT ready for beta, and with release just around the corner I knew it was going downhill quick.Dec 12th came around and turns out they had to delay the release. I was saving my money for when the game Actaully came out so I could be sure. Months passed and we barley recieved any news at all. April came and they released the game into EA, I buy it and lord and behold, game was still very broken (Still is). OMG I tell you, I had so much hope for this game. SO MUCH. Every day id say (Give it some time and theyll eventually fix this game). Its almost been a complete year since the beta in October of last year and barley anything has changed. So, I hope you guys can eventually fix your game but youve lost a customer for now. Here I come PC.... Now im going to hit that refund button and get the $50 I should have spent on Planet Coaster			"

												The beta preview that came out at the end of October is a complete disaster - and the final version is due to come out next month. So full of bugs to be unplayable, frequent crashing, and only the rollercoasters are in it, no other rides or attractions, no people, etc.The beta looks absolutely nothing like the preview videos on this page; basically a bunch of crappy false advertising.... Luckily steam gave me a refund.Save yourself, and don't get this. "

								The game is early access, people! EARLY. ACCESS. Of course there are bugs. Of course there are features missing. That's what early access means.Yes, load times are long. Yes, paths are buggy sometimes. Yes, there are some framerate issues. None of them are bad enough to make the game unplayable in my opinion. I've been having a ton of fun with it, and I'm very much looking forward to future updates. Take the time to enjoy the rollercoaster builder. Have fun with the campaign mode, building a park from nothing to giant. Go on the community section and visit other people's parks and ride their coasters! And, above all else, remember:EARLY. ♥♥♥♥ING. ACCESS.			"

												I had really high hopes for this beta. One would think that when a game releases a beta it will have ""some"" bugs. When you think about this game coming out in a month you'd think this ""beta"" should be a teaser or a fairly polished beta. This game does not live up to it's former games and they constantly lie about the whole thing. I'm refunding this game unfortunately and waiting for planet coaster (same people who made rct3). This game was rushed and is no way shape or form ready for even a late alpha needs some more years. The camera control is terrible so don't expect to feel good at all. Also do not expect to ride your rides. You'd think with them working on this for a year they would read their forums and make sure you could ride your own rides as a majority of people have requested but no. This is basically a terrible version of no limits with the ability to make paths. I do not recommend this game at all. It's a huge disappointment and I wish they would take the rollercoaster tycoon franchise out of this as this game will absolutely ruin the name for previous games.			"

												Huge RCT Fan from the original to RCT3, I genuinely thought they had turned this game around and were onto something, I understand its in beta but some of the basic fundementals just dont work and being in this state this close to release just isnt good enough. Atari have rushed this out and in the process, ran this franchise further into the ground. Thanks!			"

												Save Your Money*I completely understand it's a beta, but given how bad everything is so far there is no way it will be complete/playable by December 10th. Also, idk why my playtime hours are much smaller than they should be*After trying this beta I can easily say that the coaster builder is a total trainwreck. The controls are beyond poor and the physics are not realistic at all. There are tons of graphics/performance issues (which are to be expected in a beta), but rides fail for no reason whatsoever (i.e. work in one section during a test and fail the next test even though the track was unchanged) and whenever a ride crashes the train remains on the ground and makes the area around it invalid to place track there from then on. They should really consider trashing the current control layout and go for something similar to Theme Park Studio's, which is simpler and much more precise/powerful. I had such high hopes for this game, but now I don't even care anymore and will be getting a refund. Way to let down a diehard RCT fan Atari...			"

												Well what to say?I Know this is just a beta.Builing a rollercoaster is advertised as being simple and easy, i promise you it is not and it is really complicated.it must have taken me 10 minutes to figure out how to add more to the track and then how to change the height of the coaster.  if you deleate a track then it just joins on and then you cannot edit that part of the track.My first thoughts on this game is that it is awful if this is how they plan on making us build coasters  there in for trouble:Too many buttons doing different things.Nothing is simple.Nothing is obviouse on what to do.The controls feel sloppy.Basically i just gave up and left it.

												Coaster editor is a mess.The idea behind it is great , it has been executed poorly though.Coaster physics are beyond wrong too , you can feel every variation on coaster cam , and there is a lack of ""gravity"" on the trains too. it feels like the cars are underwater.Game is also poorly optimized (yeah yeah , it's a beta blablabla)The options menu isn't even there.I wouldn't call this a beta , this is an early alpha at max.

												After leaving Early Access, game runs much smoother, graphics are ok, but still needs some tweaking (especially when placing paths on curved land). New UI is much better and story mode is definitely a big change. Lots of main objectives and additional objectives to be done.Definitely a must for RCT fan!			"

								Great game play, very old skool style RCT3 but not as in depth currently. Lots of potential, bugs to be fixed but thats to be expected with an early release. Once you get to grips with some of the new features your be making costers left right and center. One suggestion i will make is try making your favorite real life coaster using the free form coaster builder. My choice was nemesis (Alton Tower Version)			"

Early Access Review
								Ok so it has some bugs. But what game doesn't in the early stages. It is enpowering to see so many people are actually getting behind this game and generating content already and barely days after it's realise. Whatever the politics regarding this game and it's development thus far, do you know what, I honestly don't care. Do you know why? It is because I have played it for more than 2 hours, unlike those that slate the game. You would have to be blind if you thought the rival didn't have it's fair share of issues too. Infact uless you have a stupidly high spec computer then you will find that you won't be able to play that Alpha very well. Both games are in their early stages so expect problems. Expect content not to be there yet. Expect there is still lots of work to be done and expect both games to grow with support.  Some people like to use Macs others like to use PC's at the end of the day each to their own regarding who comes out on top. But it is early days for both hense the early release drr.RCTW has its menus all ready and waiting for content to be uploaded. The bare bones of the game is ready. The graphics are there and if you are creative or know a thing or two about design then every file and every component can be updated at a flick of the switch once the main game is stable.I get the impression from Atrai that there will be a lot more on it's way and they will be updating things as new things get added and the overlays for rendering are added. Something that is very difficult to do as I understand it if the main 3d forms aren't there and the coding is unsuccessful in the first place.As for the peeps they are at present a representation of the final render at this stage and not the final look because.....the game isn't finished. Once RCTW and it's rival sorts out it's crash issues and bugs then and omg then can you image the content that will come flooding our way.If you are passionate about gaming or creativity then not only watch this space but be constructive with your critism and post it on the forum so that developers can improve and keep improving the look and the content of the game.Oh and to those that have slated the game so where exactly is your theme park simulation game that you have been developing? Oh that's right you haven't been have you. So lets leave the game development to the experts. Atrai who have been making games for over 30 years and whose systems are the key component of every game you have probably played to date is based on from their invention back in the early 1970's.

								It has a few bugs, the paths are a pain and i wish i could  add sections of track in whichever order i liked so that i can build critical sections first and get them right. It also can be slow (gtx 980ti + AMD FX8120), especially while loading. But, it is an early access game, i don't expect it to be perfect yet. It is also a significant improvement from RTC 3 (although i wouldn't mind having the addons for that in this game). I wish they had built in the bug tracker into the game to make it easy to report problems. This game has allot of potential, not there yet, but well on its way.23/06/2016On a large campaign park it will take around 10 minutes to load. I think this is because it is trying to keep track of absolutely every peep in the park at once, so it bogs down. It would be better if people were enabled in waves on startup. you could reference against average FPS to ensure it doesn't drop too much. I am starting to run out of new things to build into the park, i think im going to have to repeat some of the rides. My biggest issue at the minute(besides the load time) has to be that most of the larger food stalls won't connect to paths at all, but there are plenty of others to use for now.			"

								PROS- Coaster Builder: It's always been so easy to create a roller coaster in RCT, and this coaster builder definitely adds a challenge and makes me want to get better at making them. It can get very complicated though, particularly when the supports of (most noticeably) the wooden coaster get in the way and you actually can no longer see what piece you're making. I also found that when you ride the coaster in first person  there's alot of little bumps and mini-twists in the track that I hadn't noticed before, making the roller coaster seem really unnatural.. this may, however, be down to my inexperience with the feature.- Variety: Not too bad, only about 8 types of roller coaster, such as Stand-up, Hyper, Wooden, Flying etc. I'm sure this list will grow however. Also a few flat rides which, again, will grow in time, but for now it's enough considering it's EA. - Realism: Everything ACTUALLY looks right and feels real, everything is bigger, MUCH bigger, with realistic, big roller coaster stations, buildings take up way more than one square on the grid.. everything is just BIGGER. The parking lot out the front, the entrance itself.. the scale is just massive and really feels like a real theme park.Music: Seemingly unimportant but I like it.CONS- Not as developed as I was hoping for: I honestly thought the game was WAY more developed than this.. it still feels like a skeleton. Know that I didn't play the beta though, this is a brand new experience of RCTW for me, so I can't compare it to that. I've been following the game since it's announcements but have nothing more to go on than screenshots and trailers. I was a bit gutted when I discovered the game was coming to EA.. Atari really do have no excuse for being this slow, I think they announced the game way too early that now it's annoyed people so much a lot of us WANT it to fail. I'm not one of these people, but I sense from other people's comments that they just want to see this game drow after putting so much hope (and a bit of money, too) into it! So yeah, this far down the line I expected much more meat on the bones.. but alas, it still feels very empty. (This may contradict my PRO for variety, but in that sense I understand the game is EA and will have little variety, despite the fact I wished it was further into development than this)- Paths: oh my god. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. Words cannot describe.. They're the most infuriating thing and I can't explain why.. They've been very lazy with the paths, they don't build right, they mess up all the time.. oh my god, just paths. Sort it, please.. There was nothing wrong with simple click and place in the previous games or, heck, ANY other simulator! The grid also needs revising, I think, nothing seems to fit nicely. - Visuals, ie menus and HUD: Wooowwww it's hideious. Like, actually hideous.. I don't know if they're going for a Sims 4 kind of minimalistic display in-game, which would look good.. but it just looks so random, maybe like they haven't really focused on that yet. The menus look cheap and Alpha-like.. think Cities:Skylines, just a grey, rounded text box with some words in. Put some effort in, Nvizzio! Get some sort of theme going with the menus, like the blue bubbles in RCT3! It just makes it look.. like a game!?- Buggy: Yes yes yes, it's EA I knoooww, but considering (again) how long this has supposedly been in development (I get the feeling they just go into the office every Sunday or something to do 2-3 hours worth of actual development on the game) it's a bit odd to se a mechanic floating around and attempt to inspect a ride whilst it's mid-flow, getting kicked in the face multiple times by the flying chairs.. silly. The game just crashed on me for no reason either, to be expected in EA I know, but this far down the line? Not sure.VERDICTI want to give this games a thumbs up, just to show them that there IS somebody still rooting for this game. My biggest worry is that all these (overwhelming amount!) negative reviews will make them think ""Ah screw it, we're giving up. Nobody cares anymore, we're only going to be slated for everything.."" and BOOM, there goes RCTW. I know this won't happen, I trust the developers are passionate about this game and want to make it better.. just please do it, listen to the fans and start righting your wrongs. We WANT to like this game, I want to LOVE this game.. and I will still hold on to the hope that one day, maybe soon, I will. RollerCoaster Tycoon World could be amazing.. just look back at what made the first three games so good, and do it better. I have faith in this game, and when it's at a stage that I can reccomend it to other people.. I most certainly will :)			"

												OK, background first: I loved RCT2, played it tons and just wanted a newer up to date version on that. The beta is not this!There are 2 main issues that probably won't be resolved because I disagree fundamentally with what they have done.1. The Artwork resembles any bland MAC application with some grey boring icons and grey paths, grey coasters, low colour vibrancy where there is colour. It's like they looked at RCT2 and thought 'No, we dont like colours. We like grey and black and white. Borders? No, we don't like borders, we like MINIMAL feel'. End result: the game has no soul, no feeling of Theme Parks, you are like an engineer or town planner, NOT MR Eccentric Tycoon with a funny moustache and wacky clothing! And the game is called TYCOON, you would think the devs would know this, but apparently smart people can be stupid!!!!!2. The coaster building is slow and fiddly. There's a number of reasons for this, but it's never going to be fixed as there's no QUICK way to build coasters like in RCT2. You have to do tests and after waiting 3-4 mins for the carriages to get to the corner in question, only then do you find out if it works or not. Then you spend the next 5-10 mins trying to minimise the g-force (which is the usual issue), but you have no idea if you have done enough until you do a test! This feels like a 'Pro Mode', or Kerbal Space Program, with realistic physics, and no way for you to easily tell if your track is ok. And I'm no idiot, I built 3 coasters today and first one only took 15-20 mins, but it was just stupid the effort I had to put in!!No-one should fork over money for this if they liked RCT2. I loved that game, so the choice is yours. If you want a bland simulator then buy this game, if you want a game that is, you know, FUN, then play something else.			"

												I'm not sure where some of the reviewers are seeing that this game is due out in 40 days or 'a little over a month'.  The release date is 12/29/2015 which is almost TWO months prior to realease (from 10/31/2015).  Apologies to the prior reviewers as I did not see the first release date of 12/10/2015.Is it ready?  No, but I think in TWO months it could be.  There are some definite issues in the current state.  Coaster building is very different from the prior RTC games.  I wouldn't say it's necessarily harder, just different.  It's just going to take some time to get used to it.  The camera / scrolling needs some work in that it isn't intuitive or user-friendly (for me).  I did not experience any lag.There isn't much else to review at this point.  All-in-all I think the game looks like it could be great.  I think it would have been nice to know what the developer's intent was with this beta weekend...to test a particular aspect of the game or just give us a small taste of what the game has to offer?While I'm in the minority for recommending the game, I do so with the caveat that we still have two months prior to release.  There is another beta weekend in December if I'm not mistaken and I feel that will be a better indicator of how we'll see the finished product.			"

												I couldn't say i'm going to recommand this game.The beta only provided very basic tools, the new control needs to be get used to.The tree I planted seems not moving at all, it looks fine, but feels like a stone to me.However, I would say the new graphic loolks good, very realistic.In my eye, rct needs much much more time to be completed.Plz, developers, you could do better than this. We need the pure building fun,the playing fun. I got none of them for now.I now it's just a beta. It made me sad to think this demo will be the core construction part of the game.			"

And the early access for the RCT community seems to have been a much needed thing as they seem to have been taking much of the feedback and critiques to heart, working to implement changes and try to give updates fairly regularly.

								I for one love this game. I have been with roller coaster sense in first one came out. yes there are a room for improvements, but as a whole world is, as I see it a step in the right direction. graphics are for better. you took a lot of controls out of the mouse and put them in the key board. that was a no, no. where the travel items, trams train, cable cars? I enjoy the came, but I would like to see them put in, in the near future. now a couple of items I need help on. after I put in a bunch of food vendors how ( if I can ) do turn all on at one time? at present you have to do it one at a time. like I said there are room for  improvement. I know that it will take time. to able to ride the coarsters is great. maybe I am easy to please, but I do so enjoy this this game. please continue on what you are doing. paid 45.00 dollars for this games, please don't let your paying people down.  thank you please work hard.

								I have played this game for about 15 hours of game play. Only have had the game crash about two times on me if your game is crashing it has nothing to do with the game, it's your computer.This game it has a very enjoyable game play. For a EA game it needs some improvements, one of the most common issues is people getting sick, after rides. The pathing is a bit rough. You have to use two hands to play the game but to be honest it's EA chill. Play the game, try it out for yourself. I think this game is great it has its quirks but I see it can be improved on. This is a game you can post on a form for fixes not just complain. Half of the games that come out now are in EA cause if they make enough money they will just stop developing it. This game is true EA right a form about your issues and give the developers time. I would buy this game again.			"

Early Access Review
								Honest Review-Game Release- Early AccessTime played  5-6 hoursI personally think it has potential. Now I haven't played Planet Coaster or the others that people have been mentioning in the post, So i have nothing to compare them with. The controls are a little rough and need some refining but once you get used to them it's not too bad. The Campaign mode needs work. the tutioral does not operate like it should. There are issues with the animations of the people. sometimes you can see them fly out of the ride. gliding instead of walking. things that can be fixed. but not a complete deal breaker.Roller Coasters- Designing is fun. takes a few minutes to get used to the controls but once I did the fun began. However, there needs to be adjustment on the people because all my ""Fun"" coasters make everyone get off and throw up instead of jump for joy. even the pre-made ones you can install the people will get off and puke. I mean the one I made only has one loop and a spiral for crying out loud. how is that not Fun right???Overall I am having fun making a park and roller coasters. I really don't have that big of an issue with it. It doesn't take too long to load. though sometimes on my laptop it can stick for a moment and lag sometimes but not too much.			"

Early Access Review
								I wanted to write a review on a variety of features of the game!  So far, I'm very much enjoying this with 18.5 hours played.ScenariosI like these.  It is fun to have a pre-built park and take on different challenges. I hope they add more to this or even allowing players to create their own scenarios that other people can play.  Campaign and Sandbox mode also available.Social HubEasy to use and get other player's or friends rollercoaster creations in my game.  Amazing how talented some are with their custom rollercoasters.GameplayWhen I first started I went right into the game.  There were a few things I was annoyed that I couldn't do well, like how shops or rides were placed.  Once I took the time to actually go through the tutorial, I solved most of the issues I was having.  Take the time to go through the tutorial, it will help you and you can open any of the various tutorials at anytime in the options.  Like I didn't have snapping on at first until I realized I needed to turn it on by pressing N once to set it on.Coaster BuildingI found it difficult at first and it definately can use some work still.  The more you use it, the better you will get.  I'm sure this will be a feature that is heavily worked on throughout early access.PeepsA nice diverse bunch of peeps are within the game.  They give plenty of info of what they like and don't like.  As well as a number of variables depending on what they are doing in your park, eating, etc.  I found peeps to be the most buggy aspect of the game and the developers will need to improve them.  They graphically glitch out often like on ride cameras or sliding around when walking.Graphics OptionsI saw a lot of reviews saying they were having issues and listing beasty specs.  I have an average PC and I had no problems, minus frame drops here and there.  The frame drops seem to increase with the more peeps in the park or possibly just the park getting larger.  The developers will need to optimize, but it is still playable.  Make sure to look into the graphics settings where there are a variety of options.  There is one where you can favor fps and some others depending on what you are looking for.DevelopersThey do seem to be taking feedback seriously and giving updates.  Let's hope they keep that up as it is vital to most early access projects.User InterfaceThe menus look fantastic!  Icons are easy to understand.  The second you get into the game,  you will understand what options are for what. Mouse MovementGood.  The zoom in and out with the mouse wheel is sensitive until you get use to it.  I'd like to see edge-scrolling available like on the Sims.  Maybe there was an option for it, but I don't think I saw it.KeybindingsYes!  They are available.  It sucks to get an early access title and those aren't available yet.  Luckily, they are here.PathsPaths are slightly tricky at first, but you will get better at them the more you play.  I think the developers can do some slight adjustments, but overall, the paths are decent.  The textures are attractive as well.Rides, Objects, Terrain, BuildingsThere is a good amount of rides, coasters, buildings, and objects available with a variety of themes (also consider Steam Workshop).  Coasters sometimes seem to freeze and stop running, but it usually corrects itself after a while.  The developers will want to look into that.  I was happy with the ride variety currently in the game.Overall Thoughts After 18 HoursThis is an enjoyable game and I wanted to keep playing it and growing my park.  There is tons of potential here to grow what is already a decent base for an early access title.  There is clearly some specific graphical bugs that can look silly and the developers will want to get on that as well as further optimization on a variety of features.I would recommend RollerCoaster Tycoon World and I'm rather surprised by the amount of very negative reviews.  Many with little time played.  Again, as I said above, I was a little annoyed at first when I started, but going through the tutorial solved many issues that I thought the game had.  The issue was that I though I could jump right in with no problems.  Take your time to learn how everything works and you will have fun!			"

Early Access Review
								I've been reading alot of the reviews already about the game and there seems to be a lot of hate and lack of understanding coming from some of the people who have played this game. Let's start with the obvious, It's early access. Yes there is things that work really well and things that don't. it's all part of the development process and I'm sure the devs will get onto improving these features over the next couple of weeks and months leading up to the V1 release. The gameplay for me so far has been relatively solid and no major problems that disrupt the game completely if anything it's mainly just minor superficial things so I'm going to list them out below. #1 Pavements: These are the most frustrating parts of the game to build as far as I'm concerned and as a person who likes to keep things looking smart and symetrical this has been a hinderance does present a problem placing buidlings next to each other. my recommendation to the developers, allow pavements to connect to each other at any point instead of somewhere randomly in the middle. #2 Bulldozer tool: I had to remove some trees and shrubbery in some areas to make space for rides, buildings etc. The bulldozer only lets you remove one object at a time with can be tedious when there is smaller things hidden behind trees. If there is possiblity for a bulldozer brush tool to remove large areas of clutter quickly that would be appreciated. Overall: I think RCTW is quite a good solid build for an early access and it has potential to to get even better, I implore anyone that is thinking about buying this game that you should consider the early access tag and please make notes of any bugs/defects or anything you think would improve the game and let the developers know so it can flourish as a sequel of the much loved series.

Early Access Review
								I feel like this game is going down a similar path to Diablo 3. The games and their developers have nothing to do with each other, but D3 received such a poor reception after it came out, and probably deserved it, but Blizzard fixed its problems. D3 is fantastic now.This game is early access, and people argue that it is NOT complete enough to even -be- in early access, but honestly I'd compare this to Ark's early stages. The game is bug-ridden, poorly optimized for performance, has unbalanced systems and an average amount of content. It's being actively developed though: they release patches regularly for issues and consistently add new stuff. They don't address all the bugs each patch, but it's a process. RCTW definitely has a chance. I'm willing to give it a 'Yes' now and see what fixes come out. I do believe that they can still change stuff like path building being wonky, having to remove every single little piece of foliage one by one to place stuff, and even some of the performance issues once they get proper feedback. TL;DR People are mercilessly slaughtering this game without giving it a chance, but I think it's worthwhile to keep an eye on.			"

								Alright, I'm gonna try and be as concise as possible here...THIS GAME IS UNBELIEVABLE!! XD I LOVE IT!! Overall I felt it really stayed true to the RCT franchise while maintaining all the fun and possibilities and amazing new content I'd expect from it!Now to battle the bad reviews....Guys, give this game TIME! Have you ever tried developing a game?!? I've only been just starting to teach myself 3-D modeling and it's so challenging! These guys have AMAZING graphics for what it is, and, they keep improving it!! It's in EARLY ACCESS for StarClan's sake!!

It's a virtue right? :)Plus, I tried this game from the very instant my friend bought me a code as a gift, I was so hyped! And to be honest, the beta version prior to this early access version was a bit frustrating. Way too many bugs and issues with that (Flying coaster cars ftw!!). It also took up a ridiculous amount of my RAM and CPU power on my gaming rig for a playable game (Nearly 100% in both).Since that update, these guys have brought LIFE to the game! Literally with peeps, flat rides, scenery, theming, shops, stalls, staff, scenarios, objectives, user-generated content, and MASSIVE performance upgrades. (It now only takes up about 50% of my RAM and less than 40% of my CPU)Sure there's the ocassional thing that bothers me, but I can already spend HOURS upon HOURS desigining the park of my dreams! That's the overall point isn't it?!?Do I reccomend this game?HECK YEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHH!!! (Shouts/screams as he rides over the first drop of a wooden coaster he built) "

												This Game is downright gorgeous. And yes. It is a beta but when people expect like the full out game content, you won't get it. The game is good so far. I am still waiting to see if they will put more contents in the game. The rollercoaster builder is much more realistic and easier at some aspects but making loops are somewhat very hard. I recommend Atari or whoever is working on the game to put the old style way of building rollercoasters as well as the new one. Other than that, I can't wait to see the full game. Still needs a lot of work but for a beta, it's ok.			"

												My frame rate due to my low end laptop isnt great but the graphics are amazing, getting the roller coasters built is fun but a bit challenging.  But its in beta and needs some work, right clicking a part of a coaster isnt possible so if you end up messing up a section you pretty much have to scrap the coaster and start over again. I recommend this game to get the hang of it and to get some reviews for this game. :)			"

								After a lot of time playing around with RCTW i have come to the conclusion that the game isn't playable in this state but if some things are getting fixed, and i'm sure they will, you can have a lot of fun with it. The basic game is there but things like the machenics that don't fix your rides, peeps that walk around like zombies ect, are all things that can be fixed onces the game is getting a normal release. Lots of videos on youtube that show the ugly side of RCTW but there are also video's that show some really nice stuff. Especially with UGC. And that is something that is really easy to use. I really having fun building parks and i don't mind now that some things aren't working. I recommand this game but it's a big price for a game that's not finished. Maybe people should wait untill the final release.			"

								I waited a month after the Early-acces release, because I saw all the negative comments. Now that some time passed, i decided to get the game. At first I was a bit dissapointed with the coaster builder, but very soon I got the hang of it. And let me tell you, its awesome! Also now that they have updated the game a few times since I bought it, its much much better, and if you're waiting for the right time to buy it, you shouldn't wait any longer. I would say it has earned the ""Roller Coaster Tychoon"" badge now!..... And besides, it'll only get better from here.But keep in mind, it's an Early-Acces, and there will be bugs.			"

												As a huge fan of the RCT series, I am extremely disappointed in the first beta. The interface for building a coaster is extremely confusing and not straightforward in the slightest. There's no simple way to build a loop, delete a piece of track, or edit a piece that you've already created. It's almost impossible to build a coaster in a straight line, even with the grid tool. I was only able to 'ride' my coasters once and there was a weird box around the train that interfered with the line of sight. On top of that, the game is just buggy and runs really slow. At this point, RCT3 stands as a better game. I honestly regret pre-ordering this considering the state it is in right now, and I highly doubt this game will be playable by its release date.			"

								Pro's:- Get lost for hours on end just building intricate rollercoasters and Creating scenery and making it all perfect.- Brilliant Simulation on Coasters would work and with VR if they supported it...- Huge Expandability - Seems Great for streaming you will catch me A lot of the time streaming this game twitch.tv/meganormusCons: - AI is stupid building intricate paths they do not like this and become unable to see a 200ft high wooden rollercoaster or   a Food Cabin thats right in front of them meaning you lose business :-(.- Gets quite laggy when you start to expand and build gigantic coasters.- Need to have your own option to add sound to rides- DLC or Community content wont load into the game I can enable it but cant use any of it in any of the modes- Needs loads more scenery objects in all selections for each category like more western, Sci-Fi and Adventure.- The Ride scoring system is a total ball buster spent hours and hours trying to boost score and it buges by 0.2 or 0.3 this needs to be made simpler.I love this game whether its in Beta or not im still not sure but there are so may things that can make this take of and be pretty much perfect. I will keep playing because i love these games and this is easily the best one out there right now but it does need work through updates and patches.			"

								I have to say after all the bashing this game has received prior to early release i was wondering if my £14.99 was going ot be wasted, having played for a few hours and got a feel for the game i have to be honest its not all bad, in it current state its hard to give a full and final report but to say there is a bit of work to do yet is not stretching the truth.So far i have seen the cleaning staff walking the park cleaning without actually moving there legs, lots of peeps bounching and jittering but i guess those kinds of things will be fixed.  Sound seems to travel a lot from quite a distance away i could clearly hear the wooden roller coaster climbing a hill which should not be possible.I would like to see mouse edge scrolling as well in the final game it seems to be missing from this version.Yes the graphics are a bit roapy but not rubbish by an stretch of the imagination.  In general if like me you paid half price you wont feel quite so naffed of its not the best game in the world, had i paid full price maybe it would have been a different story.  I dont know how long before a final version is release but from what i ihave seen so far it stilll very much a work in progress with a fair way to go yet.Planet coaster is a better looking game but is also 12 months away yet and 50 QUID FOR THE ALPHA ACCESS so this will fill the void until then quite nicely.

								It's in Early Access, so there's definitely a few hiccups to overcome, but this is overall a fun sim about designing a theme park! The customization options are thorough, down to being able to theme your food stands to match the area of the park they're in. And the core gameplay: Making fun rollercoasters, works. Being able to ride your own roller coasters is fun as always.			"

								As much As I wanted this game to be good, I really don't know. The building is strange and the parks are way to small. I may just not be used to the building system and everything, But I'm not sure. My advice is to wait, I'm going to keep it but I'd say wait till it gets further in and watch youtube videos on it.

								Okay, here's the deal. Every aspect of the game needs work. However, that being said, there are some very promissing aspects of this game. For example, the coaster building mechanics are top-notch. It combines the ease of piece-by-piece with the fine detained spline based editing to easily create specific track. However, you cannot ""delete"" a part of the track, only mess around with the nodes, which makes sense. Also, because it's so ""realistic,"" you have to create realistic tracks, or it's not going to work. In the previous RTC games, you could slap together parts all willy-nilly and as long as it was a completed circut and didn't stall anywhere, it was ""rideable."" Not the case in this game, but I think it really makes you consider aspects you normally would not, so at the end of the day, you're more proud of what you've done. So good coaster building mechanics, but implementation still needs work.Another example is the staff, I don't have much to say other than I'm not a fan of the ""huts-that-take-up-space-and-provide-little-help-and-organization"" way of doing it. I think parkitect has an amazing system where you just had break rooms placed about that increaded productivity.The path placing and using is really the worst part. It's the only thing I absolutly hate about this game. It's extremely tempermental and I am always fighting it, sometimes to the point of tears. It's very annoying. (Pro tip: the large paths are the worst offenders, so just don't.) Also, because of the sudo-grid system, it's much more time consuming to place benches, trash cans, and lights. In RCT 1,2, and 3, I just went ""lamp, bench, trash, repeat."" With one per square, it was quick and painless and provided a system that met and exceded the requirements for the needs. Now, you have to pay super attention to place it exactly, and because paths don't like being even and symmetrical, it never looks good. And that's if it lets you place it! Yeah, it's really only a problem if you have OCD, but lets be real, that was one of the good things about RCT 2. I would like to see a mod or something that uses a more rigid grid. Also, while I'm on the topic of OCD, the grid that follows your mouse around (really nice, actually) has different weighted lines to mark large squares, which is normal. Well, the center line of the park DOES NOT MATCH UP WITH THE CENTER OF THE ENTRANCE!!! HOW?! WHY?! WHO?! And you can't extend the first bit of path and keep it striaght! IT BOTHERS ME SO MUCH!Anyway, I can go on, but I think I'll leave it at this: It's very promising, and I'm really excited for a polished version. I'm going to recommend this game not because of it's current state, but because of it's potential. All of the bad reviews bring up fixable problems, and over time I'm sure they will get fixed and the final result will be a great game.			"

Early Access Review
								I would have to say I was a bit nervous purchasing this game. Seeing as basically every review is a thumbs down, spending $50 was a large ""gulp"" in my throat. However, I am very happy with this purchase and I'll tell you why.I've been playing RCT all my life. Still to this day, I play RCT1, and make my wonderful parks. I probably got the game in a cereal box, I can't remember; but it's incredible. I also own RCT2 and RCT3, and being a huge fan of the franchicise in general, I bit the $50 and went with this game.The first complain I see from a lot of people is about lag. Either those claims are overdramatized, or some of the later updates have fixed the issues. Don't get me wrong, it IS a graphically intense game. Running medium settings with an R9 390 (I also have an I5-4460) gives me less than 30FPS. I still have yet to try low settings, but my point is that this game is completely playable for any modern day system with a medium to high end graphics card. If you have a cheaper GPU, you might want to upgrade for a more playable experience.We don't expect a game like RCT to be this way, but we have to realize that it is worth it in the end. Yes, RCT1 and RCT2 were programmed on a 1995 engine so efficiently than the weakest systems back in the day could run them at ease. RCT3 also was not bad, I ran that thing on an integrated GPU in a laptop. But RCT World is different. The graphics, for one thing, are better, so this is why it is more intense. Will there be future optimizations? Of course there will. Plus, Atari will probably add DirectX12 support, which should ease the game's frame rates and enhance graphical quality even more.A major plus of this game is the 1.2GB download size. I'm tired of 50GB games, this is a very nice download size. Once you are in the game and get the hang of stuff, you start to realize how much potential it has. The coaster editor is very nice. It may be more difficult to use than the old RCT games, but that's because it has so many more capabilities. The curved paths are another nice feature.If I had a complaint, it would be that there needs to be more and more scenary and rides! The more the merrier. But the truth is we all know this stuff IS coming. Atari will keep adding more content. Another pro is the peeps look really nice, good graphical detail to them for there being hundreds in the park. Also, did I mention there are recycle bins now? And you can place bins either on the path or off to the side. You'll notice nice little features like that. With some touchups, this game will be rocking and rolling!			"

I really like the new coaster designing feature, with that It helps you make more realistic coasters, it does take some time getting used too, but one you know and understand it, its a lot of fun to play around with! I am thankful however for Nvizzio adding in the old coaster designer feature. It really helps me feel the RCT franchise in it. So overall, a really nice game! Just one question, will there ever be any water rides?			"

								Bearing in mind this is Early Access I do find the current state to be playable.  There are still many bugs to be worked out.  My hopes are the developers will address issues reported by players and longtime fans.  I don't have a huge complaint on graphics as I expected the cartoonish style of art.  However, the details and movement of the people are bleak.Some things to think about:Poor optimization.Road system isn’t always ideal.  IE: Doesn’t align or connect to grid.""Snapping"" isn’t very intuitive and poorly aligns.People are poorly animated.Not a lot of content but there is a built in social share system, although it was empty for me.Lack of in depth management tools (staff management, etc.)Poor optimization. (Yes, I said it twice)Deleting can be a pain.  Would be nice to see a drag and delete feature. The concern is that it was previously said to be near finished.  I truly hope that was said in error and that development is still moving forward and we can expect to see updates and patches.Unlike some others I find the Rc builder to be quite nice and challenging for a game that offers little challenge at first to even a novice as plopping down a few ready-made rides will easily get you by money wise.  4-5 out of 10 for me.  Disappointed but hopeful will be my mindset on this.   "

I hope that this games development continues but people are pretty upset with the state of the game but thats not going to fix the issue.What this game needs is a community that is submitting bugs/issues and continue to support the devs through this early access period and as long as we do that and atari doesnt do a full release untill the fans are happy with the game then this semifunctional mess will become the game we want in the end.

Early Access Review
								RollerCoaster Tycoon World in it's current state is a difficult game to review because while the game has so much potential, it is marred by technical issues, and lack of content. When you see that this game is an Early Access title, they mean it. The game is very much unpolished, buggy, and lacks content. Atari still has a lot of work ahead of it to fix all of the bugs, add content, and optimise the game. Otherwise, the game has a ton of potential; the coaster builder, once you get used to it, is incredibly intuitive and customizable. It's a lot of fun to build a rollercoaster and test it. Operating your own amusement park is also fun, interesting and challenging.Overall, I give RollerCoaster Tycoon World a qualified recommendation; if you can ignore the current issues right now in the Early Access, buy it. But if you want a more polished game, look elsewhere or wait.			"

												It is time to write a new review.  You ask should I get RCTW or Planet Coaster.  Planet Coaster is, I am persuaded, an awesome game (and I would love to try it), but you should know it requires a more robust machine than I have to run it.  I contacted the Team at Planet Coaster enquiring whether my machine would run their game.  This was the gracious reply I received,  ""After reviewing your DxDiag report, I regret to inform you that you are quite significantly under our minimum specifications for the game. As such, I would not recommend purchasing the game if you intend to run it on your current computer"".That said, RCTW runs wonderfully on my machine.  The only issue that I find a bit annoying is that after the Unity upgrade my PxP building tiles flash different colors detracting from the park's beauty.  At this writing, I have not tried the Valentine's update.  RCTW is in many ways as good as, and in many ways better than RCT3.  It does not possess all the content or capabilities as RCT3, but the developers are still updating this wonderful game.  Even if your machine will run Planet Coaster well, you still can enjoy this game.Do I recommend RCTW?  Yes, a thousand times yes!			"

												It's just plain not working yet. This is a review from the october beta. Issues:-No sound or graphics options, which should be in any build of the game. -If your coaster doesn't work, may as well just delete it.  -When you delete a part of the path it auto fills in between the two places, making it imposible to make mid coaster edits.  -The coasters fly off the curve way to easily, and there is no way to adjust the bank of a curve after you've moved past that part-The physics need some work. There is no sense of gravity on the cars when they fly off-There is no way to pan the camera on the mouse-There is no real way to control the angle of the drop-There is no real way to control the angle of the turn-The graphics are in desparate need of AA.-Once you make supports dissapear, you can't get them back-The camera messes up where your mouse is poiting when you are building the coaster.That said, I still have hope for this game. The devs really do seem like they care about the game, even if they have to work for the wonderful publishers of games like ""Alone in the Dark Illumination"" and ""Haunted House: Cryptic Graves."" Some things that lead me to have hope are:-They are planning to update the game a lot after launch-The overall engine seems like it is a decent base for the game-The park management and modding tools they have described are promising-Atari doesn't seem to be pushing them to add microtransactions-The devs seem to want to make a good game.-They said that the old way of making coasters will also be in the game (I'm pretty sure I heard this, but I don't remember where). When combined with the current coaster editor this should help the game a lotSource: 


YouTube™ Video: RollerCoaster Tycoon World @ PAX Prime - Alienware Livestream 

			Views: 47,022		

			ESRB RATING: Everyone with Crude Humor Matt and Andy from team RollerCoaster Tycoon World sit down with Alienware at PAX Prime for an in-depth look at RCTW. Coming soon for PC!		

Conclusion:For now, stay away. I will be returning my copy. Wait to see how the game turns out, and if the devs are providing consistent and meaningful updates. If they get the game to a decent current state and are showing care to the game, I will purchace. Until then I'll be playing RCT3 and RCT 2. (screw RCT 3D and RCT 4 mobile :<)EDIT: Removed the part about the game launching in early access. I know this was stated at some piont, but I don't remember when. Thanks for pointing that out to me, Mr. Nekk.			"

												Remember when Sim Cities decided to go with a different direction and came out with Societies and their 2013 version... huge dissapointment and disaster.  That's how this game feels.  It just went into a different direction.  I suppose if you want a simplified gameplay ""sim"" type of game this is it.  For those that wanted to play a better coaster game and be more immersive there is Planet Coaster.  Both games went into this from different directions and have different gameplays, GUI, and experience.  Personally PC is the better game.  But I think younger players or people without the patience will find this game better.  Because of that I will give it thumbs up.  As with any games expect some issues on playability, I am sure patches will be forthcoming.			"

Early Access Review
								All of the reviews say it's bad but its not. The controls are a little weird but after like 20-30 minutes they're fine. I was a little skeptical about this game, ya know bc of all the bad reviews, but I really like it. The coaster building takes a bit to get used to and it can be frustrating but after you learn how to use it it's really cool. It's early access, so there's obviously gonna be some bugs, but that shouldn't be the reason you don't buy the game. If you like the RollerCoaster Tycoon games and have some cash to blow, pick up this game.			"

Early Access Review
								I own and have played both Planet Coaster and RTW, and I have to say that this isn't THAT bad. I have put in over an hour so far and decently enjoyed it. It is not as polished as Planet Coaster is, but it has more content, and is more of a game than Planet Coaster is in it's current state (no money, park stats, etc) Planet Coaster has a lot more you can make your own with clipping, RTW does not allow that. There are many things that still need to be worked on, and I hope to see updates soon. Some Updates I'd Like:When you want to place a building, ride, or path it will delete whatever is in the way of it being placed automatically.Better motions of pepsAdvertising for your parkand fix the lag when you soom out.

Early Access Review
								This is going to be a fair review from someone how has loved every roller coaster tycoon game before it other than the mobile one. i came into this game ignoring the steam reviews because i didnt want that to affect my view on the game. now after playing for a fiew hours then now just reading the reviews the hate doesnt match what i have played. Yes there are some bugs in the game that can be frustrating but once i looked past that i felt like i was playing the older roller coaster games i used to play. would i recommend it in its current condition yes but not for the price. that is one of the complaints i have they are asking way to much for this game in its current condition.Pros:-very good roller coaster building sytem-models of the rides are very well detailed but lack on texture-ui is clean and easy to learn fast-a lot of decoration options-good number of ridesCons:-Very fast Day night cycle-Rides Break down to fast -paths are very gltichy -no underground paths or rides-decoration items can't be placed anywereim going to point out a fiew main issues i have with this game the fact that you have fences then they most of the time dont fit the length of the path, or if you want to make a rock wall in water the rocks have a area around them that you can then not place another rocknear by decoration items should be allowed to clip into other objecs. another thing this game has a hard time telling if it wants to look real or cartoony the rides have a cartoon feel were everything else is more realisitc. i can build a ride and about 30 sec to a min later it will break down. and i wish there was a voxel terrain so i can build rides underground or even paths underground i used to love doing that back in RCT1. it has the feeling of a RCT game but it lacks somethings and has alot of bugs. i would recommend this game but not at the price more like $25 right now maybe at release if those major issues are fixed but not in its current form.

												RCTW for my short time playing it has gamebreaking bugs (in the sense of crashes during games and even loading games).  Those bugs could well be ironed out over time if the Dev's are still on the case, it would obviously make sense for them to do so in the long run because if they don't have a stable core game they won't easily be able to bring out expansions etc.  (So I'm pretty sure they haven't abandoned it like some would believe.)My play on it also currently suggests that you need an optimal rig to play it (Hexacore/Octocore rigs).  So if you have a low or medium spec potatoe, you'll find any park you build between crashes becoming a flickerfest as it becomes CPU locked from thousands of parkgoers and ride animations.  It's possible that some of the problems can be resolved by toning down the graphics complexity to suit your rig, however there's always going to be diehards that think because they can run a completely different game engine on Ultra, everything else should be able to as well.  (Sorry it doesn't work like that)Other than that the game has great potential but you should consider that if you buy it, be prepared for bugs/crashes until the Dev's fix them.			"

								All this hype and fighting over planet coaster and RCT World... well, i have both, planet coaster is very limited in my opinion. like 5 to 6 rides and a crappy pre coaster builder. You can customize and make buildings which is incredible, the details are insane i will admit. I however love RCT World. It feels like a full game, a few bugs here and there but still very playable and they do patches often that make huge improvements. Definitly recomend both RCT world and Planet Coaster but you will be spending more time on RCT until Planet coaster actually releases more data.			"

												I know a lot of people are giving this game negative reviews, so here is a positive one. I have always been a fan of the RCT games, having owned all of them. RTCW feels like a RTC game, it is fun and has a lot of features that I wished I had in RTC3. Better path placement, curved paths, ride rotation and more customizations that were done as mods in RTC3.I pre-ordered this before early release and the game was very rough during the early access. However, since it has been offically released, it is so much more refined. They streamlined the tutorial, giving you clearer directions on objectives and challenges. The gameplay and graphics have been better optimized, so it runs smoother.Overall, I am really enjoying playing RTCW and am looking forward to the upcoming free content releases.			"

								Not too bad so far.  There are many graphic bugs which is to be expected with early release version.  Do think it is lacking in content but have come RCT3 with all expansions so that had a lot of content.Find it odd that there are no transport ride e.g. monorail.All in all, it is more than playable but needs quite a bit of improvement and content.

								Well i thought it was about time i make a review about this game :D So i braved all the neg reviews and brought this game (cant say i really read many)but so far it is an amazing game i love it to bits - yes their are errors in the game , bugs and what notbut i have played the other RollerCoaster Tycoon Games  so far RollerCoaster Tycoon World is by far the best game in the series ( 1 example i hated in rollercoaster tycoon 3 - you could not build stuff next to fences and what not - this one you can place most things anywhere )Also wanted to point you towards the discussion's board on steam:i had discused suggestions for this game as follows:1. waiters to feed the park guests waiting inline that are starving - hire them thru the placable restarunts in the game.and for some reason i think it was Danny (cant remember the rest of his name) he removed my discussion and i dont know why - he mentioned their facebook page that they dont check that when clearly they do as the admin for the facebook page answers people(((( On A Personal Note i do recommend this game up to you if you want to buy it thoughthe asking price of $50 is alot for an early access game - check out other websites as you can get it cheaper (i paid $18)take in mind that it is an Early Access Game and has alot of bugs still..   Buyer Discretion Is Up To You			"

Early Access Review
								I am extremely impressed with the current state of the game, going against public opinion. Although some features could stand to be polished, overall the game is coming together nicely. The coaster builder in the beta is not for everyone, but the limits to it are endless. You can now make some really cool inversions that would not be possible in the first three roller coaster tycoons. Many people are claiming that the beta is very ""broken"" but i'd like to say that with some few adjustments to controls, or even custom keybindings, most of the issuses can be fixed. Just because a beta has bugs doesnt make it broken. Also, the grid based building feature has only been TEMPORARILY disabled, not removed, some reviews are claiming that it has been and its ""killing the game"". If the current spline system is too complicated for you there will be an alternative. This  beta is meant to exhibit the spline coaster builder.Edit: You people really dont know what ""Early access"" means do you?			"

												RCT Is my favourite video gaming series of all time. This game so far is looking great, its not as user friendly as the older games in the series but from having a play of its coaster editor, the things you will be able to build will be more detailed and more realistic. At the moment its just a beta, but it seems as though, when the full game is released, it will be an excellent theme park builder. :)			"

I am tisht and don't normally pre-order games and usually wait until they are in a good sale, however I preordered this as soon as I heard it was being developed.  I will say that I also bought Planet Coster too and have been playing the alpha of that.  I have no bias and I actually want to have two great theme park games.  I will continue to edit this as the game develops.I've been playing theme park games for decades (yes, I am that old!!) and it's one of my favourite style of games.The pre-realease weekend they did last year was a disaster and I was worried what game I would actually get for my money.  I anxiously waited for the next pre-release weekend until I saw that it was now released on ""Early Access"".   I guess they felt pressured to actually release something now that Planet Coaster was starting to do releases.About the game.  The game does have a lot of features in it already to enable you  to actually build and manage a theme park.  This is definately in Early Access as there are issues that need to be addressed and features that need to be tweaked, but I have not experienced so many issues like other players.ProsLots of feature to enable you to buld and manage the park.A wide number of flat rides, coasters and shops to choose from.The user content feature is amazingIssues to be addressed (in my humble opinion)Improved coaster building since pre-Early Access, but still is very fiddly and cumbersome to actually build a rollercoaster.  I'm sure with a lot of practice it will become easier, but even using the RCT like buttons to lay the track, it still isn't as easy and straight forward as RCT3.Path building needs to be worked onNeeds the ability to demolish in a draggable area.  This maybe there, but I can't get it to work.  Its a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to delete every tree and bush to be able to put a ride down.It's not so clear the benefit of the different size staff buildings.  Is there a coverage radius that they cover?I personally don't like being fored to have the entrances/exits fixed to the rides.Should you buy this game?  I would still say yes.  I know there are problems with it, some people have experienced lag which I haven't.  I have faith that Atari are listiening to the community and will be implementing the changes, requests and fixes as the game develops.  Since release they have already done a couple of updates and I hope that they continue the pace and release frequent updates and changes rather than waiting months.Yes, there are features in Planet Coaster that this game doesn't have and there's no arguing that the Planet Coaster videos look amazing.  Like I said earlier, I'd like to have two great rollercoaster games as I'm sure they'll both have their strengths and weaknesses.  Time will tell how both games will be developed.  For now, I will be spending far more time plating Roller Coaster Tycoon World than I will Planet Coaster.			"

								I've been using this game recently and, unlike its first week, it's starting to look like a real, playable game. Nvizzio is making such a good work by bringing more and more patches with new functionalities and stuff, as well as bug fixes. The is far from finished, alright, but the end is getting closer.So, the game is all you loved from those in the franchise, but way better. It's pure RCT.The only thing I'm missing is more theming... I need horror and asian deco!!!! :PGood work, Nvizzio.			"

								Even though I only have ~20 hours on RCTW I think that thats all you really need to play the game fully and find every bug. This review is based on the Early ReleaseThe biggest problem im having is depth. I understand that it is an Early Release but it feels like im playing a Revamped RCT3. So far we have seen no water rides, no police guards, trees that dont delete automatically and the standard 4 themes with 3 parks. We waited for a decade and were given a broken system that had many bugs, puke and trash everwere. The mechanics would get stuck at the exit of a ride and wouldnt fix it. There can be three rides broken but if you dont have 20 mechanics to fix it then they wont know its broken. There is a lack of depth in the whole system. I like to be able to customize the workers in the park again and would like to see better use of the sanitation system. The new physics engin is Good right now but update #3 has hit it hard in a good way. (But this is not about update #3). The new roller coaster builder is the main perk of the game and offers a much more realistic aspect to the game. Though sometimes the supports will apprear in the middle of the track the train simply goes through them... Speaking of trains no transport rides. The ratio of the game is large enough for at least a transport train, how about the good old ski lift ride. Also will there be any pools or water park add ons or will I have to pay another $50 to get thoes, maybe $10. Overall the game has a LOT of potential. But for how much time it took to get it out and how much it cost it was kinda a let down. Im still going to play the game just because I love the game. But I and the rest of the RCT community were kinda let down. I have high hopes for the future though to see what NVizzio and ATARI give us in the updates and UGC's, which is a awesome addition. The game is power hungry. With and empty park i have full 60fps with a few blips here and there. But soon after you get a few rides and about 600 peeps i dropped to about 35fps.

								At this stage the game is indeed not worth 45$The reason why i am recommending this game is becuase it's a beta game it is not done.In the future this game might be worth 45$ if all the bugs and crashes are fixed and if the game is more omptimized.But for now just get it for 17$ from sites as: {LINK REMOVED}cdkeys.comAnd you'll get the game for a much more reasonable price.

								Great game so far. Bring back a lot of the RCT nostalgia i was looking for. Still requires some polishing by the developer and maybe a few ride additions. make sure youre specs are well over the minimums and you'll be fine. i cannot run this game on my laptop but my gaming pc runs it just fine.If youre buying this game expecting a finished product... dont. Wait until the full retail release and save yourself the complaining. All of the over reviews ive seen have been people bashing the bugs that they were told to expect...Nvizzio's got my vote. They've poured a lot of time into bringing this title back from the dead and i believe they are the right developer for the job(FINALLY). The comparision of the version of the game i have now in comparison to the version i was playing a month ago is astonishing.			"

								If you are a fan of the RollerCoaster Tycoon games then you need to buy this.  I have to be honest and say that there are definitely issues, BUT it is still good.  There are some issues with the graphics being a little rough around the edges and the staff need more options.  It is good to play another coaster game and the new coaster design is pretty good.It is early access and I wish it wasn't, but that means that I don't have to settle with what I have.  I can make recommendations and expect them to be applied to the game.***I am editing this to be more speific about the errors so they can be fixed!***- The Janitors need help.  I have 16 of them and they get confused and much of my park remains filthy.  There use to be an option to drag and drop them and also to designate a certain area for them to focus cleaning.  That needs to come back.  I believe thats an absolute necessity.- The benches are confusing.  When I first put them down only a couple of people used them ( I have many benches).  Not only that but the guests were walking through the benches.  So, I moved them to the grass.  No one walked through them anymore, but the benches aren't even being used now.- The mechanics are as bad as the janitors.  I have 13 of them and they wonder about without a clue as to what they need to do ( most of the time).  I will have a ride break down and stay that way for ingame days before someone fixes it.  That makes no sense, because I have more mechanics than I do rides and plenty of paths for them to easily access the broken ride.-  Some of the outlines on the guests are wonky.  You know, when you click on them and get close enough you can see the white outline?  Yeah, some of those are just not right.- I am not sure the info kiosk updates when new stuff is built.  I have people wondering around lost.  - Why are my people angry about the souvenir stalls? They say it will have to do...Is this because it doesn't target their age-group?  Is it the prices?  Is it the color or theme?  Speaking of color and theme; these should be changeable via the actual building or, at least, the color.  All my hats are blue!!!  That is not okay.- Placement of buildings frustrates me to no end.  Why can't I snap them to pathways?  Why must I pull them back from the path and make another path to them?  To me, that is not okay.- There definitely needs to be a better bulldozer tool for mass-destruction.- There also needs to be subways and such. Also water rides.  My guests want, nay, need a log flume.			"

								This game was released nice and early and naturally that is because they need the support from fans to improve it.  I would like to point out some issues as of today that I know people are curious about considering all the upset reviews.  I have always loved these titles. So, I noticed reading comments that alot of people are upset with how the staff you place in your park are not great. From playing I see what they mean, but! They do get it done, although it takes time... I never really saw negative effects to my parks score. Or gotten notifications that the park was to messy. I had alot of complaints about there not being enough room as in pathways and things of that nature still no real effect on my overall score but I am sure that is something that can be fixed by simply making the park larger. And I look forward to figuring that out.  I took a picture of my park to display my overall score and all the annoying notifications everyones speaking of but I dont think i can post that here, but it shows my score is great although pesky notifications are there regarding the park staff being to low and stuff. As far as Roller coaster designing goes I am absolutely impressed!!!! The amount of control we have now when creating coasters is amazing absolutely great job done there. I have come to notice that getting the coasters just right takes some trial and error.  So far each coaster I have made is leading to puking guests. But they still ride it somehow lol. They give you pre-built track peices but you by no means have to use them. You can design whatever you want by simply editing a node this allows you to twist and turn or add speed boosters or breaks to tracks and it is very easy to use. I have not figured out if you can go underground with them yet that was always a favorite of mine. And yes there are pre-built tracks if you prefer that.			"

								There are a lot of negative reviews, and some of them I will somewhat agree on, the coaster designer is finnicky and certainly takes time to get the hang of, so far despite my computers issues with crashing like it has been lately, I am personally loving it, yes it indeed does have a good bit of work left but if you are a fanboy of the series like myself, I think you may love it, I myself do. Again, finnicky and tough to get the hang of, but it's a lot of fun! It's really a hit or miss in the long run, if you like Rollercoaster Tycoon, give it a whirl if you want, but if you don't, then don't bother with it honestly because there's nothing here for you unless you are a fan of the series as I am myself since day one. All in all, to my personal preference, I am loving it so far, and I think it may have a bright future with how the devs are handling there blogs lately, perhaps a good direction towards a wonderful position for the game. It's a blast! But most definitely buy at your own risk, not for everybody but if you love Rollercoaster Tycoon like myself, give it a go guys!EDIT: After banking a few more hours up, I maxed the settings and I will agree with some of the reviews, the graphics are just barely better than RCT3 in some situations, but the performance wasn't impaced all that much for me even with my ancient components, being an old Core2 Q9400, two 560's, and an nForce 790i FTW mobo, it did lag in some places but overall it did quite well, which kind of surprised be with the system requirements it lists. Overall however, if they updated the graphics, added more coasters and rides, and tweaked the optomiization for a little smoother flow it'll be perfect for me personally.   All in all, still I will say, buy at your own risk, if you love the series as I do, you'll love it!			"

								AM a roller coaster tycoon world fan and i love the game in this early access. The game still does need work on bugs,glitches,graphis of detailing,peeps,scernery like the plury vision. i also feel that they should include a mouse curso so it wont be so hard to move the game camera around like rtc3. The game still needs work and am glade the only made it an early accses but i have been enjoying the game and i cant wait till the final touches. also when you are creating a coast the camera tends to move a lot exspecialy if you are building on a hill. i Dont know why people are critisizing the game and its not even finshed people they are working on the game and nivvizzio keep working i see the potential in the game it looks great just needs more tuning and bugs scereny object coaster need a lot of fixing but i feel you guys are working hard on it.

								This game has lots of flat rides and powerfull coaster bulider once you get use to it and huge veraity of trees and plant. The colours in the game need to be more vibrant but the textures are lovely. You can get mouse scrolling and better qulity graphic by fiddling with the setting.The lack of search or refiment in the path/nature by theme is a bit anyoing and so is the lack of control over staff.The game takes a long time to load and start a park, if you try and place objects before the game starts anmiating it will crash.Overall this game is realy enjoyable.

								I think RCTW is a great Early Access game. Im really looking forward to seeing what else they can do before the release of the finished product. For the campaign, Senario, and objective lovers, I would hold off on purchase until later in the project. However for those who love the building Coasters, lanscaping, and just assisting with a awesome upcoming project, I think its a good simulator and a great installment to the classic RCT franchise to get involved with.

												NOTICE: this review is lengthy, if tldr, check pros/consIn short, there seems to be a lot to look forward too for RCTW, however there are many tweaks that need to be made. That said, from what I see from forums, this game will not be as popular as the original trilogy because the coaster designer is much more complex to use than in previous itterations. There are only 7 or 8 different coaster types currently present in RCTW and many classics from the second and even first games are missing. My guess is that additional coaster types will be offered via paid DLC, the thought leaves a bad taste in my mouth, but I can't think of another reason why certain 'cornerstone' rollercoasters such as corkscrew coasters aren't available already.The 'innovative' Spline based coaster designer is an interesting take on coaster design, it works well if you plan on building a coaster without any inversions. However, as soon as you plan on including corkscrews, loops or any other inversion. You will almost instantly get frustrated. I found it extremely difficult to create straight lines of coaster track, perhaps because the track is always attached to your cursor before you place it, and while trying to move around simultaneously, the track quickly becomes twisted and messed up. There is a premade loop that can be used, however it does not look realistic and is way too steep. The other premade track piece is a 'vertical corkscrew'. Were the developers smoking crack when they came up with that one?One of the only things that made me actually feel like I was playing a RollerCoaster Tycoon series game was when it came to choosing the colour design of the coaster. Perhaps this is because they did little to no innovation in this area, as none was needed.I designed a hypercoaster in RCTW that seemed fairly successful in design, but the test statistics showed that the ride was hardly 'fun' at all. I know for certain that this coaster would've had atleast 5 excitement if I had made it with any of the original games.It was impossible for me to judge the physics engine this game has because it was impossible to have the coaster running while maintaining a decent framerate. This, despite my computer exceeding the system requirements of the game. There is no Options menu and there is no way to change the resolution, change graphics settings or even any audio settings. I yearn for the ability to mute the annoying music that comes on if you scroll out far enough. As well, the sounds that I am assuming come from the rollercoaster stations are really obnoxious and need to be changed. However this may work itself out as more features and other sounds are added. Controlling the game is a bit of hit and miss, You move around the map with the arrow keys or WASD, I was unable to move around by dragging my cursor to the edge of the screen, something I think is critical for this kind of game. There are a large variety of paths in the game and the system seems to be fairly fleshed out and competent.All in all, if the developers manage a way to include a simplified coaster designer, in the vein of the coaster designer from the original games, I feel this game will see massive success. Aesthetically pleasing and once fully optimized, I will give this game another shot.

												IF YOU WANT SOMETHING NEW, COOL, AND FUNCTIONAL, AND OWN RCT2, JUST DOWNLOAD OPENRCT2Do not bother with this game.  It is flopping heavily with its loyal forgiving fans, and PCGamer and Atari themselves hyping this game up before it even came out seemed suspicious enough for be, but I bought it anyways.  Even with my middle-high tier PC, I feel like I was loading it on XP, ARK performed better than this.I'm not going to complain about the coaster editor, I love the spline editor, and it was going really good.  What I will complain about is the crashing is way too sensitive.  Call it difficult if you want, but it's hard to get fast speeds and keep your coaster on the track when the hill collisions don't even work and it flies off the coaster before it even gets to the hill.Your cursor and the spline editor will also magically de-sync, making the game unplayable, and for the life of me, I cannot figure out how to delete parts without having to delete the whole coaster.The music is horrid and if it reminded me of anything, it reminded me of how bad the Sim City reboot was.  That's what this game is.The beta doesn't even work in windowed mode!  You can't even change the resolution!  It's horrible!  The options menu is literally just the terms of service!!  And considering this is the most resource heavy game I've ever played on my computer, video settings are what you absolutely need the most!Maybe it will become better in the future.  I was psyched for the custom content, but nobody's going to create custom content for a game this bad.  If you want to download CC, download OpenRCT2 and look up some custom content for that.  I'm applying for my refund right now.			"

												I was expecting bugs and glitches do to it being a beta though i personally didnt see too many and the only thing that was a problem was starting the game up, i had to change my video setting from Nvidia control panel to make the game work. Other than that for just a beta and having limited features this is pretty fun.			"

								Not as bad as everyone is saying to be fair...Don't get me wrong, it's not what I would expect of a game that has been in development for so long, but it's a massve leap from the beta and has more features, so far, than planet coaster. The peeps are a little off, the paths are definitely not fully correct yet (especially when dealing with terrain) and there are some creases to iron out (especially performance-wise) but I reckon with some hard work, utilising the feedback that they'll gain from the discussions, it could be a good game.All in all, I'd reccommend if you're willing to risk buying a currently bad game, but a potentially great one! (just don't expect it to be great any time soon at the speed nvizzio seems to work at!)			"

Also the developers claim that they update weekly.... in my opinion it is very weakly..... I have yet to get an update worth playing..... So I spent my money on a piece of crap game written by a piece of crap company only based on the name.... I used to love RCT.... If they do not start updating the game soon, they will be hearing from my lawyers over the amount of mental stress they are giving me.... Today I bought Planet Coaster which is a far better game then this piece of crap game.			"

								First of all I think everyone needs to calm down. Everyone needs to stop being uptight about ""They missed this thing"" or ""It looks rubbish on my system"". Atari and Nvizzio are trying their hardest to keep true to the series aswell as adding new features that will bring new players to the game. People will think differently about it and i honstly think it looks and plays great.Yes there are a few things that seem to be an issue but thats why its EARLY-ACCESS. You need to all remeber this. They have released it with the intention of people finding things wrong with it. Overall it looks nice and has some great new features while keeping to the original games.			"

								Fun, enjoyable game!  I've played several hours on it already, and haven't encountered any serious issues.  Sure, it needs some polishing.  The graphics aren't the best, but usually things get optimized at the end of the development cycle, not the middle.For all those giving this negative reviews, try to think in terms of the enjoyment the game can give.  It delivers on what it promises, albeit not perfectly.  The developers made it clear that it's a work in progress, and we - the gaming community - should support them!For those who are talking about Planet Coaster - it is true that the graphics there are much better so far.  However, it's also still in early alpha, and as an individual who purchased it, I can attest to Planet Coaster lacking many of the features that RCTW has, despite having more optimization and modernization in it.The bottom line is - I believe this is a legitimate successor in the RCT franchise, and would recommend that people consider it!

								After about 20 Rollercoasters, Im finally Getting used to the track editor, Once you have this down, the game become quite enjoyable. Its more robust than Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 in terms of flexability, Every pre rendered part of a rollercoaster is actually creatable on your own if you like threw regular editing, the parks having free roam paths not tied to squares is quite nice, including the 3 different sizes. Full restraunts including kiosks is nice. Im excited if there is more to come with the release. Id recommend buying this if your a true Rollercoaster Tycoon Fan. All the negative comments are from people that havent even played the game an hour, which i find quite sad Because with every tycoon game, there is a learning curve to climb over. Obviously those guys were as eager to give up on trying to learn as they were on writing a bad review on steam. Good Job			"

								Considering this is early access its truley an amazing game, loving every minute of building parks and using the new coaster builder. Too much negativity is surrounding this game because of a few set backs but if you want perfection then the wait is a must and I beleive looking at the game now that ATARI will deliver plus the fans who are now playing the game in early access get to put in a lot of input and help mould the game in to something spectacular. I'm running the game at the highest graphics setting possible and experiencing no problems. Would definitely recommend this game. I've been a fan of the RCT franchise since the first game released and up to now RCTW is still doing it justice. There is still a lot new content and minor bug fixes to be added but that wont stop me having a lot of fun playing the early access version. Well done ATARI keep up the good work and I look forward to the updates. Take as long as you need just keep delivering perfection.			"

Early Access Review
								I've never played any RollerCoaster Tycoon or anything Tycoon before and I have to say it's quite addicting!! I'm a big Sims fan so no suprise I like this too. I love all the different themes you can go with in this game (different types of land, different types of rided and decorations) and I hope more will be added soon. I like how you can zoom way in and essentially explore your park through the ""Peeps"" view, it's helped me improve a lot of the customization before. That said, I think the Peeps graphics could be improved a bit more and animations smoothed out when you're zoomed out, but it definitely didn't take away from my experience.The controls are a little funky but I got used to them pretty quick. I would suggest to the developers to improve the controls--make rotating objects a lot faster, implement edge scrolling (when I move my mouse to the edge of the screen the camera moves that direction), and have more intuitive controls. I had some performance issues with Campaign mode, but not any other mode (sandbox works FANTASTIC), so I think there needs to be some bug and performance things fixed with Campaign mode but ever since I switched to sandbox I haven't had any problems at all so I've just stuck with that! I love that you can turn off unlimited money and have the ground either be flat or rugged and natural; I like my parks to look more realistic rather than just a flat ground, but sometimes I'll do the flat ground and make my own mountains and stuff so the ""sandbox"" mode really lives up to its name.For my first Tycoon game I definitely have had a lot of fun so far and look forward to more improvements and features.

Early Access Review
								Unlike most, I'd like to focus on this game's POTENTIAL. It clearly has that, but there are too many problems at its core that should've been adressed before the BETA. It's the greatest paradox of modern gaming- it's beautiful but horribly lacks detail- has so much potential but is damned to fail. In case the dev's see this I'd like to point out some small things that would go a long way in fixing this game before I move onto the cons. BTW I have not played planet coaster, I'm judging RCTW on its OWN merit. The only thing that scares me is that the company will see the mostly negative reception and pull funding out of it completely- things CAN be fixed but may not be PROFITABLE to fix when the client base is already weeping and gnashing their teeth at their early access build. Pros-Diversity of scenery options, peeps, and rides.-It's Rollercoaster Tycoon.-Lack of detail aside, has a unique, beautiful flow.-Can still charge peeps to use restrooms-Coasters crash (BUT NEEDS EXPLOSIONS)-Peeps are funny although I think it's because they're bugged (the other bugs aren't as funny)*As early access, they still have to patch this game at least once before they release itHelpful fixes-Add HD free DLC, also add option to toggle peep detail/resolution (would help performance with 1000+ peeps)-Selection tool should automatically balance terrain- too many unbuildable open spots where things SHOULD fit.-There's already a sandbox mode- make the campaign harder i.e. stalls not making profit by default-We're not all Mac users- add advanced video options!!! Not all of us like depth of field.-Add more stuff don't rely on the community to make your game, we ADD to it. ;DCons (of the type that should've been fixed before beta- lets go easy on the dev's)-Peeps IGNORE trash cans and throw up past them in the exit paths. -Janitors don't actually start working until you click on building and they leave. And they suck at their job.-Beautiful aesthetic but major lack of detail. (HD DLC?)-Peep AI is horrible. Optimization is horrible but since it's early access there's still hope. (REDESIGN OVER)-Selection/snap/grid system (which is core) is bad. Too many open spaces where you can't build.-Sound is s**t and also cannot add custom music to speakers. It's a major turn-off.Cons (Due to early access)-Occlusion poorly optimized- some paths turn invisible, tracks will disappear, etc.-Optimization and Textures (can be fixed so lets give them that- probably a memory thing)-Staff buildings share same model, use different sign/flag. Couldn't mechanics have toolboxes outside? Janitors mops?-Models for coaster trains (especially in coaster-cam) are bad. I get this may be part of optimization process. Or at least I will continue to tell myself that.-Roller coaster TYCOON world. Add shops and soon you'll be rich. No work needed. Get the point?MOVING ON... there is much potential in this game but after being led along for so many months and told that this game was almost finished, it still handles, looks, and plays like an alpha. The coaster building is great but if you're like me and hardly make custom coasters, you tend to focus on other things. I'm requesting a refund, but definitely gonna come back and see the progress in a few months. Right now, there are too many core problems but most importantly, NEGATIVE FEEDBACK, that will most likely cause them to not get enough funding TO fix the game. I want to believe that these problems will be addressed and fixed in time but the writing on the wall says that they'll make one patch, release it fully, and add half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥DLC to milk as much as they can before abandoning ship. Although, to be honest, if they DO make the effort into fixing it, I can easily see this becoming something great. I'd reccomend watching as this progresses before you commit to a purchase- they will either fix it or pull out completely and there's no way of telling what they'll do at this point.			"

								RollerCoaster Tycoon is evolving and it has come a long way from the previous versions. It is going to take awhile to get used to everything, unlike the older versions where everything is pretty much click, drop and go. Myself, I have massive ocd and the pathing is pretty much going to bother me, because no matter what I do it just wants to curve all over the place to snap to the other path. Trial and error I guess. A lot of these negative reviews come from the beta version weekend. If you are a real fan then do not let the reviews change your mind on getting the game. Yes, the price tag is high for what it is and hopefully the outcome will be worth it in the end. There are bugs and other things that need to be fixed, but as a community we can report them to get them fixed. I, for one am happy that they opened the game as early access for us to play. I have waited years for this and now I can get my fix.I will be getting Planet Coaster as well becuase I am a Coaster building fan, but my heart will always belong with RollerCoaster Tycoon. There is no negative review that will ever change my mind or make me think differently.EDIT - By the way, everyone sounds like they are having intercourse and I can't figure out how to mute it lol. Also the UGC has never worked for me. It has been blank since day one and it doesn't seem like they are doing anything about it.			"

								I played on sandbox for about an hour before writing this review.  I went in knowing this was an Early Access Game.I think this game has great potential and I'm excited for the finished product.  If there were no more updates to this game I could still find some enjoyment out of it.There are bugs, kinks, and maybe something that will infuriate you. (The paths didn't snap together the way I wanted them to.  In hindsight it provided me with a more interesting layout. I tend to accidently and intentionally fall into grids. )  I tested a little bit of everything.  At least, I tried to.   I didn't run into anything that was terribly broken.  Overall.  I'm excited.

								I've only spent a few hours on this but so far I've only come across one issue described as a con: deleting things is a pain. I will say that I have a powerful rig and can run the higher settings of the game. The only lag I've experienced is when a structure is selected on the build menu for the first time. Otherwise, it runs smoothly. I've enjoyed the game so far, even if it is more of what has gone before. Once you get the hang of the new coaster tool, you can create some cool designs. The game could benefit with more polish but hopefully that is on the cards. From what I've seen, the game does not deserve the negative ratings.			"

												While I do recommend this game, I don't recommend paying full price. There are a lot of little issues here and there and this doesn't play much like the old Rollercoaster Tycoon games. I really enjoy this game, but even on a high performance computer, it doesn't run smoothly. There is a lot of the camera getting stuck when moving around, menus not popping up when you click on a person, ride, ect. Outside of its issues, the game is fun. Its sandbox feature is exactly what I was looking for with the ability to move the camera around to get right up on the buildings and rides. I wish the ability to play pre-made parks like the old rollercoaster tycoon games was a feature, but it doesn't seem to be. The pre-built parks you play are more of levels in a tutorial of the game. Overall, I would say this game is bugged and has a rushed feel which is why I wouldn't recommend paying $35 or more for this game, as I did. However, if you really enjoy these types of games, and are looking to build your own parks with an up-close feel, this is the game for you... as long as you can get past all those little glitchy issues!

								I know a lot of people are saying that Atari really dropped the ball on this, but it really isn't that bad, even for early access.Here are some good things about the game:The new track editor is really easy to use.The controls are easy to useThe tutorials explained the game pretty wellWorkshop supportHere are some things that need to be worked on:Placing paths works well most of the time, but it acts a little odd sometimesIt isn't easy to place buildings down where you want them sometimesThe graphics are alright, but I don't really care how it looks.The Audio sounds REALLY strange after I move the camera around sometimes*I've only played for an hour, so as I find more I'll add it, other than that it's looking pretty good so far.Anyway, I recommend you get this game.

								Hiya guys, now i dont like to complain about rollercoaster tycoon world because i have grown up with the rollercoaster tycoon games, but a few things thats really bugging me. 1. mechanics dissapear when you place them down and the ride doesn't get fixed, 2 my game keeps freezing and lastly i have to create my whole park again because the whole game has glitched and according to my park notifications, there are no food stands or medical centres in my park but i have put plenty in, now before people complain saying this is early access yes i understand it is, but when i brought the game last month or month before i had no problems what so ever but since they updated it its been playing for me i hope this gets sorted, but apart from the few problems i have labeled i am very pleased with the game its alot of fun, you get alot more choices than roller coaster tycoon 3 which i even still play today, i upgraded to the deluxe edition and you get alot for your money which i was very happy about.anybody that enjoys roller coaster tycoon i reccomened the game, like i said its early access so im sure these problems will get sorted amazing game, fantastic graphics brilliant!but please fix these issues.please before judging this game by pictures or little gameplays try playing the game for yourself because thats what i did and i loved it after judging it so be aware that ewatching is very different from playing thankyou :) happy rollercoasting everybody!

Early Access Review
								I've got 3.6 hours in this game and over 200+ in the other RCT games. I grew up with RCT getting my first one from a ceral box as a young child. I love RCT so That's how I'm apporaching this review. TL:DR at the bottom.The game is buggy and has loads of issues. I've had texture problems on rides, rollercoaster work during testing than later not make it back to the station for no reason, disapearing sceneary, slowness, game systems just not working at all and a plethera of many, many other issues. The game has 6 different rollercoasters, and a handful of other rides that are mostly based on themes that you might not want in a generic park. This game is no where near release ready... but it's a prime subject for Early Access.With a lot of games you know from the first few hours if a game has potential or not in Early Access, if it will ever get better or stay complete crap. I can say that RCTW is not the latter, this game has so much potential, it's just not there yet. As I stated above it has so many bugs and issues and lacks key mechanics like being able to tell janitors where they are alowed to go and where they should stay.There's so many issues like how after getting off of a ride every single person on that ride will throw up. Also guests just pee everywhere, literally every where even outside of washrooms. You don't get enough feedback as to why somethign isn't working or why guests are unhappy or why they litter right beside a garbage can. And yet, this game is just as addicting as the others. I do recomend this game but only if you go into it knowing that this is not ready, no where near ready. It fees like an alpha. If you know that, and you will not go into it expecting something like RCT3 level of completeness than I recomend this. Don't go into Early Access games expecting finished products, you than are an idiot and no sympathy is given to you.			"

								Very glad that RollerCoaster Tycoon has made a comeback after 12 years. As for everyone who are leaving negative feedback about the game, you do know it's an ""Early Acess"" right? It's not the final product. You people need to stop whining about how bad this game is. Yes it has performance issues, yes there's  a lot of features from previous games missing and etc, but these guys are working hard on this game. The whole point of early access is to help developers get ideas. The game is fun, and it brings back the nostalgia!While you people are bashing the game, how come you don't talk about the good? RCT comes out with constant updates that brings many features and fixes. Just recently, on April 20th, they released a major update. The graphics are cartoonish, but RollerCoaster Tycoon always looked cartoonish and not realistic.The new Coaster Builder is amazing once you get the hang of it. The game supports Steam Workshop. Sharing Coaster Blueprints was a bright Idea. You can share each other's coasters and add them to your park. You can visit other people's park! The new grid system and, of course, the a new system where you can place objects, foliage, trees, food stands and rides at any angle. The new Curve path system. It's a new addition to the RTC series. Yes, there's some bugs with it. But what do you expect on a  EARLY ACCESS game? RollerCoaster Tycoon World is amazing! It brings back the fun of RCT3. Yes many work needs to be done with the game. But I'm not upset because I know they will bring it to success. The performance, the long loading and other major bugs doesn't bother me cause THE GAME IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT! I understand people are giving the game negative feedback, that's their opinion. But what did you really expect from an Early Access game? So yeah, if you a die-hard RCT fan as I am, I would say it's worth picking this game up. They constantly update the game.   But, if you want, you can just wait till the final product is release.			"

								This is a seperate game to Planet Coaster. So i will not compare the two.I just bought the game today, it runs fine on my laptop and graphics card so thats not an issue but what annoys me a little with this game is that the rollecoaster stations are pre built, theres no walls you can decorate them with. and to me the building system just seems a little fidigty, i much rather prefer the old RCT3 build system, but hey ho. This game is lacking in some areas but hey its Early Access (for some reason co-5monthslate-ugh) but it certainly has some potencialthankyou.			"

Early Access Review
								Needs some work, but, has potential. After reading the reviews for this game I was hesitant to purchase it. Ive been playing RCT since the original and was excited to get my hands on this game. The game is in early access people. There are going to be bugs. The developers are counting on us to help find them so they can fix them. I didn't experience any problems playing the game. I'm running an AMD FX-8350 with a GTX 970. The coaster builder does seem complicated, and I think that the fixed coaster pieces need more options. Manually building a coaster takes a very long time. I've only played the came for about 30 minutes, but so far I think the game has lots of potential and am interested to see what happens with updates. The developers seem to be releasing patches and updates pretty quickly so kudos to them. Yes they need more ride options, yes they need more coaster styles. Again, this is EARLY ACCESS. If you're hesitant to buy because the game is unfinished, WAIT for the finished product.			"

								One of the best Roller Coaster Tycoons yet! Even in the early stages the game is really good I had so much fun playing it and can't wait to see what else gets relesed. There are a few things I would like to see change. For one the 57% loading error can be very annoying but i was able to overpass that. the other thing is it runs very slow and it would be great if it was modified a little to work of slower computers and maybe even Macs. The game is great and I cannot wait for the full version !			"

								Currently the game is very rough and not overly playable as a full park simulator but there is a lot of potential with the systems they have in place for it to become a great RCT game. The game is in a state that should be expected for early access and not reviled becuase it isn't complete. If you are unwilling to play an unfinished product then wait for the games full release.Performance note:I have read a lot of reviews saying that the game is unplayable due to performance issues, my spec is 16GB of RAM, intel 6600K, and gtx 960 and have absolutely no performance issues what so ever.

								im a fan of rollercoaster's game since the first rollercoaster tycoon and this one is something diffrenet atari did here a great job and im thinking its only the early access. about the graphics i wont gonna lie they are bad compared to the graphics in 2016 but for me its less important.in this game everything became bigger for me its a big change because i got used to put everything in small area and alot of rides and shops and here im actually need to expand my park and cant put alot in one area which is diffrenet alot for me so i need to get used to this things.for me i really love this game and cant wait for the full game even if i didnt finish the early access yet good game.about the reviews ""mostly negative"" i didnt give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about it and im not disappointed from this game just remember this only the early access version i hope they will change the graphics and the path building and some in the rollercoaster building and some tips in the rollercoaster building.for me its 8/10.

								Fun concept, but still so many bugs that make it difficult to play and enjoy. Just trying to do pathing is probably the most frustrating thing, it is very difficult to take a curved path and place shops/entrances to rides on it. I kept having to create extensions off the main road to connect the entrance to the shops/etc to because you can't have something on both sides of the path if it's curved apparently. It would randomly not let me join paths together where there was nothing blocking the placement of the path. Had to build my park in a square pattern to get it to work.			"

												This game is going to be great I can already tell. I played the beta weekend and yes the options are limited in what you can do. But you have to realize this game does not release for another almost 2 months. There will be features and systems integrated. A lot of work has to be done, that is true. But in the end, it'll turn out a great game. I was able to jump right into the game and just play it without having to relearn the game. I did have to go through and see what menu had what but it carries the same principle of all the rollercoaster tycoon games. So I suggest buying it!			"

Early Access Review
								I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who is expecting a perfect game. Rollercoaster Tycoon World is far from perfect, and it certainly isn't ready for anybody who isn't willing to deal with bugs. This game has them. Some are game-breaking (like, I can't launch scenarios without my game crashing entirely, in one case requiring a complete reboot of my ROG laptop) and some aren't (my favorite thus far are the horrible animations on the giant slide - I laughed at that for far too long). However, I feel the game is fun, and it has a lot of potential. Some people are also experiencing issues with RAM leaks; I am one that can say that I haven't had that issue on any of the devices that I have played RCTW on. All were laptops with good graphics cards, a quad-core proc, and 16GB of RAM. I can also say that I haven't run into anything particularly problematic yet, except the scenario-issue I mentioned earlier. And for those complaining about graphics: there's a setting that you have to disable. When we got Beta weekend 1, everyone was locked to the highest graphics possible, without any FPS prioritization. The game now adjusts automatically for the specs that it thinks the computer can handle. However, it also has an FPS prioritization setting. That  needs to be disabled to get the full quality of the game. Thankfully, my laptop (970 Geforce GTX) can handle that. Not everyone can. If you don't have the minimum specs, the game won't run well. Period. If you don't have the recommended specs, it will run better than not meeting minimum, but you still want recommended. The game is demanding, even with some optimizing. For those that don't meet recommended - wait for further optimization unless you are patient.			"

Early Access Review
								Critical analysis of RollerCoaster Tycoon World by ChipgtIntroduction:I have always been a fan of the RollerCoaster Tycoon (RCT) Series. Like many I have been following this games progress from the beginning. However, this is my first review. I have been looking through some of the steam reviews of the game and felt that many people have been writing review very one sided reviews based on other games. What you must understand is that this review will in no way talk about another game. I feel that from a gamer's point of view you should NOT talk about how another game is better when writing about a current game. Since the early access has launched a week ago the developer has released 5 large updates in response to what their users have been saying. This is awesome, because many of the changes have been based on user feed back. So without anymore delay I will discuss what I like and would like to see changed.Delete tool:OK, Of all the things in this game the delete tool by far needs to be one of them. With the added features of bushes, flowers, trees, and more in the random terrain generator there is more that the users must delete in order to build a ride. Currently as of the 5th update you must individually delete one thing at a time. This is extremely annoying. In game time it took me a year to delete a small area to build a ride. I would like to see a delete tool that allows the user to delete more than one object at a time. Or an option were when you hold down the mouse button you can paint away (delete) just dragging over something.  Road/ PathsSo when compared to RCT3 this has come a long way in a good direction. However I have found that there are issues when trying to connect a new section to an old in the transition form large path to small. For example, If I plop a store on a long path, and then want to make an intersection in a different place I am ofter forced to connect it adjacent to a store. In other cases I found areas where I wasn't allowed to build a path and there was nothing there blocking it. Over all I like how it works I just would like to see these restrictions addressed. Other times I want to delete a small section and redo it and I can't. I would also like to have the option to change the theme of a path that is already plopped. This would be a nice tool for theme while building new or modifying old sections.Coaster builder:This has by far had the most critiques by many people and I have to say this tool actually is good. I'm not saying its the best, but it is good. I have used other coaster simulators in the past with NO limits and there are a few features that I would really like to see come to RTC world for example, multi view builder. I found that when building a coaster I am moving my view everywhere. It would be nice to have a top down separate view in a remade construction GUI would be nice. This would make building coaster easier.Building builder:I love new new buildings. However, I would really like to have tools to build my own. Something that would be scale to the new restaurants would be very nice.Conclusion:RCTW is still in early access, the game series has come a long way, and will only continue to get better as it gets closer to official release. It will take users and any gamer who is interested in this series to provide continuous input as new updates come out. I for one will continue to add to my review until official release.

Early Access Review
								Having played this game for just over 19 hours I want to give my fair assessment of the game.  There is no denying that this game has been riddled with problems from the start.  That being said, while I was not happy to hear of the ""early access label"" I definitely support the decision now.  This game is not remotely near full release!There is no denying that this game has a lot of issues.  The real question is whether or not the game is moving in the right direction.  Pros:-coaster mechanics have vastly improved from the beta-looks and feels like Roller Coaster Tycoon series-a fair selection of aufio and video settings-farily strong visuals (though nowhere near close to Planet Coaster!)-a large assortment of props and settings-a fair selection of options:  campaign, sandbox, etc.-incredibly fast load times-an easy to use interface-the ability to buy more land to expand your park-easy to use teraforming options-three types of land/terrain with more coming in future updates-prompt responses from the developer and a timely update of upcoming changes and additions-steam workshop creations Cons:-the path system is very awkard at times-manually deleting of every single object (aka no mass delete)-limited amount and variety of rides, shops and food options (at this time)-no ability to build structures using idividual pieces (will be added at a later date)-peeps (they are awful re: visuals, movement, etc.)-30 second night cycle (I really don't get this one...???)  -maitenance doesn't seem to work and/or is very buggy-rides break down and often don't get fixed in a tmely manner, or at all-no ability to place lights and benches on elevated paths-complete lack of optimization... this game will make your system ""work"" for it!-occasional crashes and there is NO Autosave featureI have faith in this game but I also have many concerns and reservations.  I was tempted to ask for a refund but I made the choice to commit to the game simply because I want the game to be successful.  I had 100's of hours of playing RCT3 and I want this game to deliver so I have decided to support Atari on this one in the hopes that this can turn into something special.  Only time will tell if that is a sound decision.I also plan to buy Planet Coaster at some point.  However, a big issue with PC is the GPU specs.  Most systems will be able to play Roller Coaster Tycoon World.  The video card requirements for PC are very high at this time and a lot of people will not have the hardware to run the game at optimal levels, if at all.   RCTW can cater to a much larger market at this time and the fact that it's on Steam is huge for me.   For people who want the Roller Coaster Tycoon experience and are willing to put up with a lot of bugs and glitches and minimal content, then I recommend the purchase in order to help out the development team.  If you don't want to put up with all of the hassles of ""early access"" then I strongly reccomend that you pass on this game for now.  Be very clear that if you buy this game you will be getting a very incomplete experience.  So, do you want to support the developers or do you want to wait and see? That's my .02c  Take it for what it's worth.			"

								Fun concept, but still so many bugs that make it difficult to play and enjoy. Just trying to do pathing is probably the most frustrating thing, it is very difficult to take a curved path and place shops/entrances to rides on it. I kept having to create extensions off the main road to connect the entrance to the shops/etc to because you can't have something on both sides of the path if it's curved apparently. It would randomly not let me join paths together where there was nothing blocking the placement of the path. Had to build my park in a square pattern to get it to work.			"

								Unlike MOST reviewers of this game, I am going to respect that it is still in development. I have waited years for this game and pre-ordered it and was patient enough to wait 4 Months for early access. Though it is still buggy and incomplete, one such bug is switching the graphics level after returning to main menu can crash the game.So I will give this game a 60/100 or 6/10 because it brings back my childhood and because it is still in development.This review has been edited			"

Early Access Review
								 I preordered the game in november and I was a bit disappointed when they cancelled the december launch but I would prefer they work on it instead of getting a dodgy game.  So far I have played 7 hours and  I am really enjoying it. It was a little tricky at the start since I went straight into sandbox mode then realised I should do the campaign to get to know the controls, which I did. After working out the controls I have been experimenting making the coasters and I am able to make a good one, even tho i am no expert with it, i wasnt an expert with it in the other RCT games either lol,  but i do have fun and that is the point. I know there is a fair few negatives but I don't have a problem with the game. It works perfect on my laptop and have no problems with settings or game play. All you need to do is give it a few hours till you get use to it. The controls are different. Well that is my rant. Hope you enjoy, Because I absolutely do. :D			"

								I am really digging this game. No it's not done and yes there are bugs, however, I find that I'm spending hours just building the enterance to the park. I've seen trailers of Planet Coaster and gameplay as well. No RollerCoaster Tycoon World doesn't have as much detail in object layout and what not but RollerCoaster Tycoon World has everything I wanted from RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 and that leads to my biggest surpirse from this game yet. It honestly and truly feel like a true RollerCoaster Tycoon 4. Not the mobile game, but it feels like the RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 sequle we all asked for. Face it, if Planet Coaster wasn't coming out everyone would be in love with RollerCoaster Tycoon World. That being said, shut up, stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing, play, and enjoy.			"

								The game is in development and I think that there will be some months until it will have no bugs and will be worth. However, it is already fun and it will be great.If you want a normal game, and are not willing some important bugs, you should wait to get this game.If you are willing to see important bugs and see how the game evolves and improves... You should buy it. In addition, you can help the developers in the official website and forums, they are hearing people and doing a great job with the updates.			"

								RollerCoaster Tycoon World is fun and has more content then I expected for Early Access. The graphics are nice for this type of game and it runs smoothly for the most part. In my opinion they have improved in many ways from the older RollerCoaster Tycoon games, but it is missing a few things that I feel are important, such as the ability to set routes for your staff. There are also a few bugs but in my time playing I have not experienced anything game breaking, hopefully these things will get fixed in future updates. If you like Rollercoaster Tycoon games and don't mind bugs and possibly missing features then I would recommend giving this game a try, just keep in mind it's Early Access.			"

												With 3 theme-park games released (Rollercoaster Tycoon, Planet Coaster, and [still in early Access] Parkitect), I kinda got overwhelmed with the games I'd been waiting for a long time. But of course people tend to compare (that's comprehensable). I can understand a lot of the criticism in those reviews, but I would not rate this game a ""thumbs down""... I enjoyed it a lot and will enjoy it a lot more at one point. Right now I'm used to play the game of the competition, so I stick to it for now, but there will be a moment, when I want some change of pace and go to RCTW. I'm a fanboy for theme-park games (of course I played all the good old classics), so every new theme-park game is welcome (as long as there are no micro-transactions, RNG, etc.). Also, I see way too much hate in forums, reviews, etc. Sometimes it feels like mass-hysteria: ""Oh look, these guys do not like it, I guess I shall not like it"". So like my opinion or not: I enjoy this game. PS: Please stop the hate, say what you do not like, deliver arguments about what that game lacks, but please don't be a whiny emotional hatetroll! Only with constructive feedback, future games can be better. Thanks :D			"

								As many have mentioned, many of the glitches and bugs that began at launch have been corrected. At current there is a satisfactory amount of gameplay available right now. There is still a ton more to do, but for a game that is considered Early Access there is hours of fun here.My only issue with the game currently is the Peeps seem not to behave correctly and they crowd up or do not take care of their needs right away. I watched Peeps walk past the bathroom when they had to use it. I've had a few crashes, some glitches with building pathways, and when my park gets to over 2000 visitors, my PC seems like it is about explode.If you are on the fence about purchasing this game, most of the negative reviews were written the week after the game was available. Look at recent reviews. A lot has been fixed and now the game is playable.			"

								Addictive, Fun and Early Access!In the Few hours I've played with RCTW. I've found the game to be very fun, I lost a lot of hours in my first game session.The game is still in ""EA"" And some people seem to be expecting magnificent results. ""Is the game buggy?""- A little, If you have a underspec'd PC , Or badly setup, Expect crashes, issues and bad performance. With my setup I get on avarage 50-70fps with the only time it dropping on loading big coasters. Loading times in between screens is short and hasn't crashed yet. The game crashed once while on a twitch stream, That in mind I had Google chrome open and eating away a good 40% of my Ram. nothing ground breaking, Just a bit of optimization and small patches should get it working fine.""Is the gameplay good?"" - Yes! Overall it was a joyful experience, I had many tasks, And a lot went wrong, but after that it went smooth and I had felt like I had achieved something. The tutorial is fairly simple with you learning more for yourself. But for first timers it gives you plenty of info and can be skipped. I see a lot of competition between RCTW and PC. A lot of Veteran fans to the series seem upset.RCTW is a lot lot cheaper over PC. On the opening screen of RCTW, They say there will be bugs and anything you want to change/add or even remove because you think its bad. Tell them! As they are open to peoples opinions.. They heard from the community that it was unfinished and that they should push it back, they did. They also changed many other little things.I can't say this game is the best RCT, Nor can I say its a perfect game. But its fun, its cheaper than its competitors, and all round fairly cheap anyway. It has lots of fun, I've seen much buggier EA games. And for its EA as of now. you get a lot of tools and things to play around with. You'll also be able to shape the finished product if you give feedback on what you want.TL;DR:So overall "" It's a not half bad Theme park Sim that is closer to its last gen game over its classic RCT 1 and 2. But still packs a great deal of fun and time to be played with all possibilities of the game changing down to you!""75/100 - I look forward to what they will add!Review will change on Release date.

								The devs have been tirelessly working on this game and it shows. Having played it the day they released it, I can say the progress is great. frame rate fixes, graphical improvements, ui enhancements, new content, the list goes on and they haven't shown any signs of stopping. That being said, it is still early access for a reason. Mainly lack of complete campaign and little diversity in coaster type (no log flumes or many of the coaster types from previous games) This game is not fully fleshed out yet, but it is cool to see how far it has come since initial release.

								For the game being early access it's actually really solid.  I have not run into any game breaking errors.  Only small stuff that will be ironed out before full release.  Gameplay is fun.  There are a lot of amusements beyond roller coasters to play with.  Coaster building can be as easy as building a pre built coaster or you can do a full custom track.  My measurement for if a game is worth it or not is the number of hours I play against the cost.  If I can get an hour of entertainment for each dollar spent then it's a good deal.  At the time of writing this I have 17 hours played. I'm sure I'm going to get my monies worth. :)			"

								I've played this game for 24 hours altogether and now I can give it a full review. When I first got the game, I knew it was early access so it naturally wasn't finished.It's improved a lot since the last update and I've really enjoyed playing this game.A few things.Don't go into this expecting a completed game because it's far from complete. There are plenty of things to iron out, include and it still needs to be optimised so there is some Lag, especially when you have a park with over 2000 Guests.It is playable though just don't expect it to be perfect. if you want all the features and stuff like RCT3 then stay well away and maybe wait a good few months and then purchase the game but if you can't wait then buy it now and help the dev team with the game.Otherwise I can and do recommend this game. It's fun and still has a lot of features to enjoy it for a few hours each day.The most recent reviews out of 60 are 33 positive / 27 negative. that might p#help you figure out a little bit too!!			"

								Graphics wise this is a lot better then the previous game. Since it is early access  you should accept that there will be bugs. It's sad that there is a lot of hate going towards this game. But besides the few bugs that I have encountered  this game is doing very well and is worth buying.			"

Early Access Review
								Let me first start off by saying that in its current state i would say that i do not recomend this game. There are still quite a bit off bugs. I am still have multiple problems with janitors and staff etc.. Which is making the game in the later game harder. Example you cannot set routes for them so they wonder wherever. So you have to hire more of them which makes you have negative income. Also almost every rollercoater ride makes the peeps vomit like no tomorrow still even after the update. Also the snapping system with the paths is driving me bonkers. The rollercoaster building has some issues like when you rotate a track into a spiral it zooms out... However they just realeased a patch yesterday and i was able to play for a while before the game became unplayable. (due to the staff) They fixed some bugs and they know whats wrong and are listening to feedback. This game does have ptoential. They added some new elements which seem pretty cool. I would like to see more done with the heat maps such as which shops or rides are producing negative income etc.. I am giving this game a thumbs up because i believe that it will be a good game when its fixed. If it gets fixed. "

Early Access Review
								As a fan of Roller Coaster Tycoon through this title, I say to the negative reviews, YOU ARE WRONG!!!Before my input, I will tell you if it’s worth it. YES! YES! YES! BUY IT NOW THEN READ MY REVIEW!That being settled. The review: I waited forever for this game to release because of the negative reviews. They were going to release it many months ago and I was EXCITED! Then due to negative feedback, they decided to wait for release until they fix and add stuff to the game. THANKS A LOT NEGATIVE PEOPLE! >:( Then they released it and yeah, it has some issues, but it's still EARLY ACCESS! How about shut up already! It's not even complete and people like me paid a lot of money for the Deluxe Edition and I had to wait months to actually play it. The only way people could not like this edition is one of two ways. 1. You are a fan from the first game of the series and you expect WAY too much from this title. Not only do you expect it to be incredible graphics and mechanics because pc gaming has changed so much in the last several years since RCT 3, but you act entitled. You expect it to be some kind of magical fairyland of new gaming. It's NOT! It's a new title and it DOES keep true to the originals. It is an upgrade basically. 2. You are too young to appreciate it. You started the series way after windows 98 and XP were the it thing. You didn't see what a revolutionary game it was for its time. So you have ZERO nostalgia or background to appreciate it. It's kind of like X-COM fans who never played the original UFO Defense or Terror from the Deep. You don't get how good it was and it doesn't bring back memories of when you were a young gamer playing on that crappy computer that was barely able to word process. It was amazing and fun and you can appreciate the new ones because you understand its journey.Pros:- The game is true to the original series in many ways.- Great game mechanics - Great graphics in its current state- New more customizable elements. (Ex. Path curving, point by point roller coaster editing, etc.)Cons:- Still has some work that needs to be done. (Forgivable amount of work and expected in Early Access.)- Negative reviewers and reviewsSummary:Worthwhile game and great for true fans of the series! A worthy buy! "

Early Access Review
								Please don't take the 'Mostly Negative' reviews for granted!It's extremely clear after playing about 6 hours of Early Access that the game is nowhere near complete. This is in both variety of contents and overall optimisation. The fact is however, that the lack of content isn't at all a problem right now, the game, over time, will have new features and shop, rides, coasters, etc. added to it eventually so we have a lot to look forward to, also the premade coasters don't have any banked turns and there's no way to edit them in game.On the other hand, the game's optimisation is very poor, of course this can be fixed by the developers but, at the minute, is a huge problem. FPS drops early game, buggy coaster builder, poor shadow movement, etc.I, however, believe that once this game is fully developed and out of early access, the game will live up to it's initial expectations, the 'mostly negative' doesn't mean anything at the minute, if you've ever played RCT 1, 2 or 3, you'll know where I'm coming from. If you're new to RCT, only buy into the game if you know what to expect, otherwise you'll probably be disappointed until it's out of early access.			"

												Optimization issues would be the main flaw to this game. As soon as you start adding new stuff into the park, the frame rate takes a massive hit and I'm running on a i7 6 Core CPU, 8GB DDR4 RAM and a GTX 970. Gameplay is actually not bad, it's vastly improved and makes building much faster.I really don't understand the complaints as I've had issues with the previous entry into the series about the gameplay, though a grid system wouldn't be bad to add in as an extra for people who want to build paths that are equal. That would be my main complaint about the gameplay really because I can't access the other stuff until launch. Graphics looking nice.For a RollerCoaster Tycoon game, the graphics are actually pretty good for a change but I did notices a few graphically errors like the ground changing resolution the further you move away from the ground but character models look decent and the overall RollerCoasters look great. Sound design is alright.Now, what I really have an issue is the lack of sound in this game. The RollerCoaster sound effects are awesome and all but I would really like to be able to add music onto the ride as well as hear different varites of music. The sound does cut out when you open a ride and then suddenly click the building tool which was pretty strange. Overall: People are holding on TOO MUCH to  nostalgia.As a fan of the series since RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, I've had little to no issues with the game mainly because it was a BETA GAME and not the final product. But I must say that what I've been having great fun in the game it's actually really good and has the potential to be great! Also, to the people complaining about how ""It doesn't keep to the old style"", grow up. This is a game that actually IMPROVES upon the sequels and gives you more creative freedom to make amazing Death-traps- I mean amazing ""RollerCoasters"" and gives new comers to the series an easy access to the game if they haven't played before.I'm not going to give it a rating because I want to try out the full game but from what I've seen from the beta it's a:Have a Go - Rating			"

								After the long wait I am pleased to say that this game is well on it's way to greatness. Some features need to be fixed up a bit, such as clearing items in multiple instead of one at a time, however overall I had a great time playing the campaign to get my bearings. As it is, I would say it is complete enough for the game to be enjoyable, any further fixes are just polishing it up more.The graphics are also really smooth, I played on high setting with no lag. Cant wait to see how it looks when it is complete! :)Update:People need to calm down. The reviews are mostly negative because clearly people expected a finished game. I did too, however I know that this game is well from finished and the team updates and fixes things according to user data quite regularily. It is coming along and it has already improved immensly from release. I very much enjoy this game, I mostly have been playing in sandbox mode for some casual fun, and I cant wait for the next updates!Update 2:I am very impressed with the efforts of the team managing this game! It gets updated frequently, DLCs are fantastic, they are paying attention to bugs and fixing them. I truly believe that this game will only continue to improve.			"

Early Access Review
								Awesome start, but the early access version certainly leaves a lot for improvement. I expect fans of the franchise will love it, and newbies won't. I'm a fan, so I LOVE it. But as of March 30th (early access launch date) many of the things I love most are missing from the game. Some of the things I expect to be improved are as follows:1. Being able to change the color of the rides. 2. More control (or at least better effectiveness) of staff (especially janitors), 3. Easier path-making (especially curves) - to this end, it would be nice to have some pre-built curves like a quarter circle which could be resized. Doing it manually is tedious and frustrating.4. Simple color-block decor pieces- One of the beautiful things about RCT2 was the ability to stack and arrange decorative elements to create cool structures. This should be even BETTER in RCTW, but it sounds like they just want users to make the stuff for them. A minecraft-style building-block option would be a blast and it should be easy to do.I LOVE the interface. It is way ahead of RCT3 in pretty much every way! A few months from now I'm expecting to love this game. Right now, it's just ""all-right"".			"

								Honestly what can i say the game has issues but not enough to make you enjoy it.  i played over a hour and found i quite enjoyed myself.  It wasnt great but good enough for me to say i will go back on this later.  i cant recomend if this if you remember the good roller coaster games.  But if you have never really had a go at one of these buy a old rollercoaster tycoon.  You will have more fun..Still give this game a try if you fancy trying this a try.  Maybe in ayears time it might be good but i think most people already know there is another game coming out soon that is alot better.im still gonna recomend this game tho because i enjoyed it			"

Im not really sure what everyone was expecting from this game, becuse the negative reviews outweigh the positive 30-1. I can only assume this game will be getting better with the future updates.			"

								As a true fan of RCT this game is amazing. Yes its got bad reviews and yes its got bugs. But seriously people what do you expect its ""EARLY ACCESS"" and it may have been that way for a long time but its come a long way. Some bugs are annoying but some are easy. My only issue i have is i wish i could break a damn part in the middle of my coast and create new parts all together. All it keeps doing is the custom coaster which is fun but it takes some getting use to. clicking either 1-4 and then using the scroll on the mouse on each node on the tracks to tweak the track how you like it.THE MAIN REASON I BOUGHT THIS OVER PLANET COASTER!!!!!! PC is Family friendly. RCTW you can do as you please. If you want to open a unfinished coaster then by all means do so. Watch them crash n burn. Create a coaster just like the one from the very first RCT where you cranked up the speed and the they launched off the rails and all died. make the twists and turns so sharp it jumps off the track if they are going fast enough. Highly reccomend this game even with the bug which they are working on and i know they will get it down pact and this game will be AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

I mean yah if u like graphix that is fine but dont whine about them if they are not to your liking. I mean BroForce is awsome and chars in that have 3 pixels. XD. Now people go bla bla about planet coaster, and i tried it and hated it. This game is simple to learn, once u get used to the coaster builder its fast and easy. I have a beafy computer, (i7 4790k & GTX980Ti) Tho was playing maxed out on 4k, broadcasting on steam. Screenshare on skype and watching netflix and was still not having lag. yah a bubble now and then during coaster building but mostly only when being annoying and running track thru ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of other ones so all the supports had to be reconfugred (Automaticly ofc) Overal i like this game, price is high but i feel that it is high for every game. Iv spend some hours playing now and enjoyed every bit of it. "

								Although it had a shaky start, RCTW is slowly becoming a worthy adversary to the triumphant franchise.  With Planet Coaster being released at almost the same time, it was worrysome to see all the attention go to Planet Coaster.  However, over the past few months, Frontier Games has focused more on RCTW, and the addition of piece-by-piece building could shift the perspective of the game.  With it's sudden burst of attention and very frequent updates, this could slowly become better then Planet Coaster.  "

It's in EA to help thes devs create a better game, to get better feedback via the Community Hub. I don't think this game deserves all the negative reviews from people who excpect a full game in Early Access. The coaster creation tool is a powerful one, but needs polishing. It could be a game-breaker.			"

								I bought this game in march so I didn't get a chance to see the older beta access. But, I get to see early access which is great! Sometimes it says that the game is not responding and I have to close it but I think that it is because I have 8GB of ram and the requirement is 6GB. I like the spline based coaster builder. It is very fun to make round coasters as it curves just how you want it. I saw that some peeps (Mechanic, and others) look like they don't have a moving animation, they just move with their body frozen. It looks like they have rollerskates. Seriously it's true! I recommend this game if you don't mind bugs and any other things. I don't like how you can't select multiple things to delete. That option was good in RCT3 so I think it should come back. At first I wasn't very good at the camera control but later I got really used to it. I think that there should be autosave (backup save) so that if your game crashes, your info is still there.Pros:Simple coaster builder.Wide range of graphics options.Very realistic peeps in terms of stats.Great campaign mode (gives you help.)Cons:Glitchy peeps.Coasters need lots of adjusting before they work.Lags when there are over 1000 peepsNo autosave.I would have to go into the game to look for more things.Thanks!

Early Access Review
								Built a circus, featuring a woman flying right across the screen.I was really unsure if I wanted to buy the game or not considering the high price (for an unfinished game) and all the negative reviews. My boredom and love for the RCT series got me to buy it anyway, and I honestly can't understand what all the complaints are about. The game works just fine for me, it's a bit slow when starting up a saved campaign, but nothing too troublesome. It was a bit confusing in the beginning, but it's a brand new game to learn as well, and it didn't take too long to understand how to build stuff. So far the only trouble I had with building is the roads, but use lots of space for now and you should be okay . The coaster builder is also a lot of fun, I enjoy building my own coaster a lot more now than I did in the older games. The guests have bugged out and stood still for a short while, but they started acting normal again soon. This has happened only once so far (after 5 hours) and wasn't really a huge problem for me because I could still build attractions and do whatever I wanted.One thing I miss from the older games is actually being able to throw around the janitors to sweep the paths, my paths are disgusting right now even with all the janitors patrolling. Right now you can't really control the park staff at all (unless I've missed something.) I'm assuming this will be added soon, along with bugfixes and more awesome features. It's still in early access so there's some things missing, but if you're a die-hard RCT fan I would reccommend testing it out. I'm not tired after 5 hours, there's still a lot for me to build, and so far I've only played the campaign mode. If you're an old fan or new to these games and not sure about buying it, maybe wait until release.I like this game as is much better than RCT3, so I'm sure it will be great when it's done.			"

												This review here currently is based completely on Beta 1, I have a video too if you wish to see more in-depth and footage to back it up. So basic rides and normal buildings are turned off for this, paths, decorations and the main meat of the game, coasters are there. Now I have to say the coaster editor is HUGE, you can change the track styles, the type of rollercoaster, the pitch, turn, edge and speed of your tracks. Have a massive drop and then make sure you can fix it at the end or bye bye humans. Its fantastic the amount of sheer detail to a tiny little detail can do. Paint it whatever colour you want, have multiple carts and more! I had a blast and its great to see RollerCoaster Tycoon return and with a bigger editor than ever! The vide link can be found here -

								At first it didn't work for us (Load up) and so we bought a new Graphics card only a budget one (Gigabyte NVIDIA GeForce GT 610) however that worked like a charm, the gameplay was ok, however that's because the Windows Desktop is old and needs replacing but it's usable. So we recommend it, the only issue is our old PC.			"

								I love that game, but there are a lot of bugs that need to be solved!Here is what i noticed you can improve:- Days are passing too fast- When you close the park people would take months until the park is completely empty (!)- If you build a coaster, it won't delete trees and bushes, so you'll find missing supports- I can't select the Buildings and Scenario options to build Restaurants etc. (!)- Paths are really difficult to build when you are over the ground levelI hope someone from the game developers will see this list!Thank you for all the work you are doing for this fantastic game!DB			"

Early Access Review
								The Game is progressing extremely well I think the main issues before the game crashed was the coaster building was lagging after it reached a proximity of $10,000 to build ( Game Crashed at $13,000). The Paths im having issues with the shops. I had to to a zig zag when placing paths to individual shops which I thought was a little scrazy. The Peeps/Ride Cam wasnt working on my computer and neither were the buttons as they hovered over the main options bar (Paths, Scenary, Buildings, Rides etc). The Tool to remove objects with was always picking up where my mouse was so i had to be away but near the object to delete. The People in the game are coming along really nice but some work is needed. As an understanding to the early access it is quite buggy as you mention so the best thing I did was not to rush and wait 2-3 secs after placing each object. Coaster Building I'm Still  Struggling with to control. Everytime I wanna go down it goes up and the nodes are extremely sensitve. When Clicking on a piece of the track it should not move unless wanting too (Sensitve) asin my case i tried twisting some turns and lowering/rasing track pieces and all it kept doing was moving around so maybe a feature to lock the track in place to stopit from moving or reduce sensitivity. Out of 2 hours of playing I could on place 5 buildings (3 Food Stalls, Information and Restrooms), 3 Rides one from each category (Didnt see or get any bugs while they were running) and few scenary objects from the mission. My Laptop crashed when I finished it and wanted to test run it. The game is actually pretty good but while running Nvidia 740M or Intel 4600 graphics cards it still bugy... Just wandering if you maybe have the graphics/resolution of the game to high still? I know its been reduced from last years trial in October but its probably only going to work %100 on desktops that have 4Gbs or more graphics/video cards and higher screen resoultions which is a bad thing for many of us tycoons out there. At this current stage I will give the game an 7.5/10 for qaulity and performance.~UPDATE~ 1/4/16Okay So after playing it for a whie now and still having issues with bugs. As mentioned in earlier reviews the paths need fixing, i dont know how to widen the paths, the rides break down after a year and the bins do nothing. Made a Wooden Coaster (I dont Recommend) it has to continually buffer and reboot the whole tracks supports just to change and just recently I built this awesome Floorless coaster which Just Crashed my Computer while running on 1020ppi. The game uses exactly 4gbs of ram which has got me questioning why as we only downloaded 1.2gb of gaming data. Its slow to import tracks, The paths are never straight (zig zag) and watching peeps getting into the coaster is hilarious but obvisiously its not meant to happen like that as some may all ready know you can watch the peeps get in and out but its like a claw just picked them up and plopped them in (falling from the beems/light height. Expansion is easy to do if you follow the tutorial its really basic except when building a coaster. What everyone needs to know its a work in progress Planet Coaster is going to have the exact same building style as tycoon however there graphics is smoother whereas in my experience in 1020ppi is harsh and rough in some areas. When moving around the map get difficult as clicking the arrows direction once u end up on the other side of the map/park and you can only do so much detail in your park with decorations and shops before you start to lag and loose controls.MAJOR HEADS UP!If your coaster is costing any over $10,000 you will experience minor issues. Now if your coaster is over 15,000 to 25,000 cash then you are gaurantee your computer to fry like a french fry. I made it to 19-20,000 and BSOD I got. The expansion are easy but are hard to gain as they double each time starting from 8,000 for your first lot. I still love the game and when the bugs and issues get fixed I cant wait to play an non issuing game. It's a work in progress Ill ive the game 6 Months as of today to get 90% minimum of functionality till I stop playing it. I still Couldnt use the peeps cam properly on rides but ont he coaster I have to use my key arrows not the on screen. The Pathing needs more freedom and more colors should be added to the coaster even a color wheel/panel ranging from 365 Color ratio. Also the best way for the park to run smoothly is to disable your internet once loaded the menu screen close everything except steam (Disable/Turn off Security Firewall Temporarily) and the game should give you a good 3-4 hours happiness playing. I did notice that some of the rides where too big for the park and we should have a freedom rand of where we put the Entry's/Exits to boost creativity. The Brakes and Boost force I still dont understand like what does the ratio even mean I tried having a Slow friction brake before a drop and my coaster stalled on a 1.0 ration when flying through at 60-80kmh. Ctrl Z should be an undo button for any building criteria. I accidnetally deleted a section of a track and I couldnt recover it so I tried fixing but the corners or straights were off point and increased nausea manged to get 35 in Nausea for my Floorless some how when it was smooth and delicate besides near the chain lift and brakes near station. Overall great Game but exiting, loading, saving, importing, exporting can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ but its a work in proress hope for the best :) STOP COMPLAINING!!! YOU TRY AND MAKE A GAME LIKE THIS WORK 100% BEFORE ACTUAL RELEASE. IF IT NEVER WORKS IN FILM INDUSTRY WHEN MAKING FILMS (FILM FESTIVALS, FILM TRIALS) THEN WHY WOULD IT WORK IF IT WASNT TESTED AND REPORTED BACK TO THE PUBLIC!!! (Just Saying get over it and accept the positive you negative creepers, EA couldve made it worse ""purchase this general game for $10 now expansion packs to rides and scenery etc $30+""and it wouldve still be unfinished... look at Sims 4)			"

Early Access Review
								After reading the comments on the page I was almost discouraged from buying the game!  Thank GOD you spoiled children did not change my decision.  The real tell was that most of these people had less than an hour of play time.  GET REAL!  Just because you don't know how to play the game (Controls) and skipped past the tutorial, does not mean its ""Awful"".  The poor developers and Atari need to continue posting updates each day to hold your hand through the process and have been nothing but understanding, even with all the discouraging posts.  Personally, I’d tell you all to ♥♥♥♥ off... but that’s why I'd never be a good CEO :)The Bad:- When the sun goes down, it lags the tiniest bit.  (NOT A BIG DEAL AT ALL, barely even noticeable besides the shadows moving)- Semi annoying, you cannot zoom in close to check out your Sims. The Good:- I was able to build rides - Attract Sims to my park- All the main, game changing, functionality works well- Tons of new features, which do work.- All of the bad has been acknowledged by Atari and they have taken ownership.  KudosPractice patience, be aware of your surroundings, play the campaign, and don’t be an idiot.. then you might just enjoy the game a bit.  :-0 (PS. Some of these are life skills, so take note)Also, if the specs of your computer suck - don't ♥♥♥♥♥.  Fix your POS or go get an xboxGod I wish I could give my self an upvote right now! :)			"

								I haven't play too long yet, but I must say that it seems to be shaping up.  If you look past the performance issues (I have SLI 980 ti (2) running, so I really shouldn't experience ANY performance issues), the game is enjoyable.  Its simple to quickly get a fairly nice park up and running.  Painting the sufraces with textures, placing scenery and buildings is simplistic but fun.  I do hope they will add much more in-depth editing of features they had in the previous version of RCT (3).  There some bugs and irritating behaviour, but this is still an early access.I am soooo looking forward to this as it gets more polished and featured.			"

								Played the game for nearly 8 hours so far, If you are looking at buying this game I would not pay any attention to the negative reviews, yes the game is unfinished and has been in development a few years, but I believe that the future updates will make the game what it should be!The current issues with the game are below:1. Path system is annoying, but you get used to it!2. Can only delete 1 item at a time, if you want to get rid of lots of trees you have to do it 1 by 13. Janitors seem to be pretty lazy, no matter how many you have - but this could be my placementThe game is worth buying, but the price is a bit high at the moment (Only buy it in the sales!)			"

								Look, don't necessarily believe all the negative reviews on this Early Access. Is this going to be a good game? Yes, absolutely. Is it ready to go right now? No. That's why it's early access.I grew up playing the original RC Tycoon games, and this is definitely going to be a worthy spiritual successor. The graphics are good for a simulation game, similar to Cities: Skylines, but not similar to GTA V, or Crysis 3 (it's about perspective here, it doesn't 'need' photo realism). RCT World needs some optimization work on the park guest animations, and so far, you can only build Junior, Family, and basic Thrill rides.  I'd definitely recommend waiting if you're looking for a finished product, but if you are wanting to see the development from now til release check this out.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm getting a little bit fed up with seeing negative reviews from people who are either basing their views on the Beta, or are just saying ""Get Planet Coaster"". The game isn't perfect, heck it's not even finished (hence early access), but I've been hooked since it launched into Early Access. From the beta, Nvizzio and Atari have definitely improved features and I can confidently say that this is an addictive Rollercoaster Tycoon game, albeit glitchy, rough around the edges, and needing a few improvements. I truly believe this will be a great game once it's ready for ""final release"".The positives:- A great addition to the RollerCoaster Tycoon franchise, considering the fact that it's been passed to many different developres throughout it's development cycle.- Early Access. Atari/Nvizzio can see what we like, dislike, and improve it before final release.- Coaster builder is great fun, many improvements have been made since the beta.- The themes provided in-game are nice; I've enjoyed creating different ""zones"" in my park. Currently working on a Wild Western area as I type this.- Ride the rides, returning from RCT3.- Large variety of decorative pieces for the park, and 3 different maps.The negatives for me consist of:- Having to manually bulldoze trees/foliage to place buildings which is tempermental. Would prefer it if they were automatically removed.- Path tool can be very annoying at times.- Performance is rough - sometimes very smooth, othertimes the game will get sluggish.- Graphics are generally fine, although shadows seem to disappear at times which makes the game look poor. - Peeps will sometimes not animate and just slide about the park.To summarise... the game isn't finished. Remember that. RCTW has many positives, and definitely needs some work, but that doesn't stop it being a fun game. I would say to give it a try if you've enjoyed previous instalments but if you're unsure, then wait for the final release to make your decision as this is in early access.RCTW and PC will be great additions to the tycoon/simulation genre, and them both releasing at the same time is a good thing as it means they can both learn from each other and their communities.

The graphics are prestine and the game functions fine. I have an intel i7 4790k processor in my system and i'm sure that helps running the game. Not sure why everyone is having so many issues, probably not strong enough graphics card to run the game.			"

								Ok, so at time of writing I only have 3.3 hours in-game, but I feel like I can already judge the game by the most important criterium in my opinion: Do I have fun playing it?The answer to that is a resounding YES!The game is far from perfect, I'm not saying anything like that. In fact, in my screenshots are a bunch of shots of bugs I found in tonight's session. But none of those were game-breaking (although I had to delete a coaster once... a shame).Anyway, yes, I recommend this game, no, it's not perfect, or done, yet, but yes, I am having fun while playing it.If anything of note changes, I will alter my review to reflect this.

												Highly do not recommend this game.you can't build anything with spline track building. you cannot do peice by peice anymore.Atari should have stuck with frontier and keeping to the same based system they used for RCT3.R.I.P RCT.all i have to say. Roller coasters have Brakes, and block brakes and lim launches and chain lifts etc, but since when does block brakes look like Transport tires that go through the track that also stay static?the building of coasters need to have Piece-by-Piece. because within the length of the peice you've placed how are you supposed to change a little bit of track if you've removed the entire peice by peice.my eyes will now stay on RCT3. this is no dig at the developers, but we all know that mattlab has a great interest with theme parks and the rct franchise, but since roller coaster tycoon world. its gone down hill. you are missing all of the theme park and roller coaster aspects. RCTW is done hill from here. i'm sticking with RCT3, NoLimits, NoLimits2, Planet Coaster.			"

												The game really isn't as bad as everyone says.  I kind of enjoy it.  The coaster builder is great, but even better is the goaster editing tool, once the coaster has already been completed.  The game is simple and enjoyable.  While I don't mind the system for unlocking rides, I would have prefered using the old ""research"" method used by previous games.Really, the only problem I have with this game is that it crashes quite frequently.  I've played the game for 5 hours and it has crashed about 5 times.  I don't love that.  but when the game plays, I have fun with it.  It is not planet coaster, but it wasn't trying to be.  I picked this game up on sale, and I would recommend it for the price I paid.			"

								I think the coaster editor has been greatly improved.  I'm already loving being able to easily download items from the Steam workshop.  This game runs great on my computer & doesn't take as much CPU as Planet Coaster.  So that means I can still stream it too!  Thanks for getting this game out to us sooner!  I think the user feedback will help Nvizzio decide what to tackle next (Seems like the 1st thing would be peeps).  But look at the feedback that was provided during the October Beta, and now the Coaster editor is 100 times better!  I've always been looking for that perfect combination of No Limits spline based bezier curves & ease of build such as RCT3.  I feel like I finally have that now with this game.  Even if the rest of the game remains broken (which it won't) I don't care :-P			"

								I think this game is good, but admittedly there are bugs that need sorting out, some of which can be rather stressfully annoying. I would definitely not pay full price for this game, although I would recommend the game, it does need work. Bare in mind it is still in early access. It's fun to play, at the end of the day if you like building theme parks it's great.The bottom line is this - Yes there are annoying bugsNo it is not as bad as what people make it out to be It has the same concept as the previous gamesDon't pay the full price, catch it on a sale, or buy from an authorised cd key dealerPlanet Coaster looks great and could potentially be the 'better' theme park tycoon game "

								Might not be as good as Planet Coaster but they dont pretend you can play it and take your money for a beta then say.... Maybe one day... We have all the special snowflakes playing right now. HahaHowever you rate this game, it`s out, it`s working and not behind a privacy gate on steam.Two thumbs up for that alone.			"

								I would love to see the controls be like RCT 1-3 with the mouse pad. Its to confusing the way it is now. The game has crashed on me a couple times now. Please FIX these Issues then it will be a great game.			"
