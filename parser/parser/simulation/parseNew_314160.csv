												I'm a private pilot and I've owned the boxed version of Flight Simulator X for years.When I upgraded my system to Windows 8.1 I was saddened to see that my old Flight Simulator X started to develop glitches.  So when Steam released a new version I was excited.  I bought it on day one of it's release. However, free flight mode wouldn't work.  But after emailing DoveTail Games tech support they deteremined that I had a corrupt download.  I did a re-download and install and it worked perfectly.  The problems were not with the game. I'm very pleased that the graphics are better than ever.  There is over 24,000 airports around the world all with exact runway layouts, taxiways, buildings and scenery around the airports.  Plus every major city, tourist attraction, landmark, river, lake, stream around the world has been simulated. Navigation aides operate just like in real life.  Flight Simulator was a huge undertaking and it's all at your fingers for just a few bucks.  Amazing.If you plan to get your pilot's license or need a tool to stay sharp (without spending $100+ per hour to rent a plane), then Flight Simulator X is a must have.  It's just a no-brainer.  Even if you own other flight simulators, you won't find any with all these features. Microsoft along with other companies spent many years and millions and millions of dollars developing this product.  When it was developed it was actually built to take advantage of faster computers that would be available in the future.  That's why as time goes by, the game actually gets better.   While I use it as a flight instruction tool, my son uses it like a game.  He enjoys the missions and together we go on sight-seeing tours.  We've  Flown over the pyramids and over the Nile river.  We've tooled over Washing DC and viewed the Lincoln Memorial, The Washington Monument and the Whitehouse.  You name it we've been there, Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Space Needle, etc. Your kids will learn more about world gerography from this game than from any book.  Because it's not just pictures, it's real life simulation.  They have to take off froma local airport and actually find landmarks.   After I bought my Steam version of Flight Simulator, I was going to install my boxed ""Accelleration Expansion Pack"".  But to my surprise, I found that it already came pre-installed with this Steam set. AND THE BEST PART... I once paid over $600.00 for a packaged video course on getting a private pilot's license.  But FSX comes with built in flying lessons by legendary Certified Flight Instructor Rod Machado.  He will teach you how to get not only your private pilot's license, then your instrument rating, then your commercial license, and then how to become an Airline Transport Pilot.  That much real life training in a real life flight school would be at least $25,000.  But you get it for free with FSX.  Obviously nothing beats learning in a real plane, but this is a close second.  And it's all for the price of a pizza. Since my first purchase I have purchased several copies as gifts for friends and family and would recommend it as either a game or a learning tool for any future private pilots.			"

												When I was a Navy primary flight instructor, I made sure my students practiced with Microsoft Flight Simulator.  The program didn't teach them everything they needed to know to become pilots, but it did help them get the hang of basic flight maneuvers, local area navigation, and instrument flying.  I could tell which students used FS and which didn't: the ones who had practiced with FS consistently performed better in the real plane.That was years ago.  Now, I have a child who has expressed an interest in aviation.  When I went looking for FS, I found it here on Steam.  I bought the program and a joystick, and today we worked on level turns.  He could turn to the assigned heading; he could maintain airspeed; he could hold altitude: he just couldn't do all three at the same time.  This is entry level, first-flight stuff, and I'd rather he get a feel for the three axes of flight for pennies at our kitchen table than for $250/hr for an instructor and a rental plane.  I'm thinking of this as $9.99 well spent!I'm running the program using Windows 10 in a Parallels window.  My computer is a 2012 MacBook Pro with a 2.9GHz Intel Core I7 processor, 8 GB of memory, and Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 M.  The program's running smoothly, with many of the performance sliders at or near maximum.			"

												Decide to take job flying some celebrity person to an upscale spa for some easy money. I take off from Catalina island in my cessna caravan and fly to Santa Monica to pick her rich butt up. My engine fails halfway between the island and the Mainland. Try 10 different things to get it started again. After failing all 10 times to get it working I realize I am now flying a 1.5 million dollar glorified glider. I put on some enya music and let jesus take the stick. I didnt make it to the mainland, the whales adopted my plane and I as one of their own10/10 would tell that celibrity to charter a mothereffin boat next time.			"

												TL;DR: It's basically the same simulator that Microsoft published in October 2006. See the chapter about differences if you're not new to FSX.Long version:Those who don't know the series, should know that Flight simulator X is called FSX by short. I've been using flight sim software for a long time now, and actually got the FSX: Gold edition for free from Microsoft in 2006, so i have spent some hours (about 1500-2000) in this before it was released on steam. In this review i will focus on FSX: Steam edition as a game presented for new users, and then point out the differences between the Steam edition and the regular one that was published in 2006. Flight Simulator for new users:To be fair, if you only want to play FSX for casual arcadeish gameplay, crashing planes and so on DON'T BUY THIS.If you have checked out FSX on youtube and found HD videos of big living Airports, shiny ultra realistic planes, and other things that look very realistic, and think that this is what the ""game"" is, then DON'T BUY THIS. These videos is a result of many add-ons, a beast of a machine, several short clips, and a lot of editing. They look incredible, but doesn't represent FSX for what it is. But if you are new to flight simulators and want to learn the basics of flying, and/or want to learn how to fly by instrument rules, or knows how to fly and want to fly from/to locations you know, you should buy this!A short list of what this simulator has to offer from stock:Pros:- It includes the whole world, with almost every airport (some big cities, but mostly blocky buildings at airpots).- Decent flight model (How the airplane reacts to the world)- Extreme rate of customization (see add-on chapter below)- Many settings that allow anything from basic to advanced flights- Decent amount of stock airplanes.Cons:- 32-bit architecture/VAS (See Add-on chapter)- Poor performance (Very CPU demanding, and not forgiving for AMD users)- Stock planes (very basic and does not represent the real aircraft very good)- Add-ons (see chapter below) Add-ons Flight simulator must be the sim with the most add-ons in the world. It's amazing how many developers that make things for FSX. Without the add-ons i would NOT recommend this simulator. An example of what add-ons you can buy/get is:- Airplanes: Anything from basic free planes, to really advanced and realistic airplanes like the Majestic Dash-8 Q400 or PMDG 737 NGX. - Scenery (Landscape/Cities/Airports): Anything from free fan-made stuff, to professionally made add-ons from companies like Orbx FTX, Aerosoft, Flight1, and so on. - Weather/Textures: Like with Airplanes and Scenery you can get a lot of other software to boost the quality of the weather system (new textures and possibilities to get the real world weather), ground and water textures. - Tools/Mission packs: You can also get a lot of mission-packs, and other tools. Both freeware and payware. Add-on cons:Even tho FSX is nothing without it's add-ons, it's still many problems with them. Often to get what you really want, you need to pay a lot of money to buy all the good add-ons. And there is also the fact that the more add-ons you add to FSX the slower it loads. Some add-ons also cause problems with other add-ons installed (from minor bugs to FSX not starting at all). This happens more often with freeware add-ons than payware add-ons. Also because of the poor performance in FSX, and the fact that it's heavy CPU demanding (I got an 4Ghz AMD 8-core processor) you might not get to a playable framerate if you have combine a detailed airport with for example the PMDG 737 NGX (6-10 FPS). If you run Intel you will get a much better performance because of the logical cores in the intel processor.  Also; Remember that this version of FSX is called FSX: Steam edition. Even though every add-on for FSX should work on FSX:SE, some might have problems if not optimized for FSX:SE 32-bit architecture / VAS  Disclaimer: Im no expert on how the architecture of software works, nor how VAS is built. The following are own experiences and forum research to find a solution to this problem.The biggest achilles heel that haunt allmost every FSX user is VAS (Virtual Access Space). Im not going to go in detail on what it is and how it works, but i will tell you the basics, and it's limitations.VAS is basically virtual memory (Note: this does not equal RAM, nor harddrive space). Each program you run gets it's own chunk of VAS that it can fill up. If the VAS limit is exceeded the program will STOP WORKING with the well known ""Out of Memory"" (OOM) error. FSX is built on the old 32-bit architecture. This limits the programs VAS to about 4GB. This becomes a major problem when you start putting add-ons in FSX. Too many add-ons, or add-ons that is poorly optimized will push the VAS limit and cause an OOM. The VAS will fill up over time. An example: FSX base game will take about 1,2 GB. When loaded into the world you will be at aprox 2 GB VAS. You then have a fancy add-on airport that takes about 300MB, and an add-on airplane that takes about 350MB. You then start flying with a VAS at 2,6GB. No problem you think? You take off and fly towards the destination, that is on the other side of the country. On your way you fly over 4-5 other add-on airports, and your VAS is suddenly 3,7GB. Then you reach your destination, and on final, about to land you hear a ""DING"", with a message telling you ""Out of memory"", and FSX quit. Another problem with the VAS is that it doesn't clear it's memory when you don't need it anymore. So if you fly a short trip from airport A to airport B where you reach 3,2GB VAS usage, and then start another flight from airport C, your VAS will still be 3,2GB. FSX Users have several solutions to avoid this error, like for exampel using a program to monitor their VAS so they can save the flight and restart FSX. Another solution is to deactivate all the scenery you don't need for the flight. Also, the AI traffic fills up the VAS, so be sure to have this set to 0%. Some developers also run the core of their add-on in windows and not FSX to save VAS usage. Other than that, it is NOT possible to fix this issue, other than developing a new simulator that uses a 64-bit architecture and allow higher VAS usage. Difference between FSX and FSX:SEIf you are a long-time user of FSX and wonder if you should buy the steam edition, the answer is maybe. I will list the main differences i've found between FSX and FSX: Steam edition:- FSX:SE is a re-released FSX: Gold edition, so all servicepacks are included- FSX:SE uses Steamworx for multiplayer. FSX used gamespy (no longer supported after february 2013)- FSX:SE can be installed on every computer you own using steam, and no CD-key required. Every FSX disc have a maximum installation limit of 5 before the disc is useless, and you had to save the CD-key.- FSX:SE is still supported and receives updates. Microsoft doesn't support FSX anymore.- Some bugs from FSX is fixed, and FSX:SE is tweaked to run better on modern computers.- FSX:SE does however NOT include the SDK that's included in FSX.There might be even more differences that i haven't noticed/forgot about when i wrote this.Overall it runs slightly better than FSX, and when i finally had to reinstall FSX i landed on using the steam edition. Conclusion:I recommend FSX:SE because of all the add-ons from FSX, and that there are few other decent options out there. You should also check out x-plane 10 and P3D (Lockheed-martins version of FSX). I wonder if anybody actually read this. :p			"

												The Microsoft Flight Simulator series is one of the most iconic PC game franchises of all time, and, to an extent, back in '06 FSX lived up to what was expected of it. Aside from the obvious performance issues and supposed cut content relating to visual fidelity (some early screens depict incredibly dense scenery and fantastic lighting effects that weren't  seen in the final game, even on the highest settings), it was a good way for the series to come to a close. The Steam Edition of FSX now exists because of an agreement between Microsoft and Dovetail Games, who made the Train Simulator games. This agreement permitted Dovetail to make a few minor tweaks to the game to allow it to function properly on newer machines (specifically Windows 8.1), manage the updated multiplayer component, and obviously distribute it on Steam. I am not fond of the Train Simulator business model, and thankfully the devs have NOT modified FSX at all in this release, as a result the legal agreement. This ""Steam Edition"" comes with the Deluxe Edition of the original FSX, the ""Acceleration"" expansion pack, all service packs, and said performance enhancements. As I stated above, you can also play multiplayer again.If you're new to Flight Simulator, are an X-Plane enthusiast, or are just interested in aviation in general I strongly recommend picking this game up on sale, while the sale lasts. There is a TON of content included. FSX allows you to fly around the globe (no BS micro transactions for different places, a la ""Microsoft Flight"", the failed attempt to ""casualize"" the series in 2012) completely unrestricted, and comes with 24 planes/choppers, which all feature a set of liveries. The AI aircraft make the world feel more alive, and airports feature pivoting jetways and moving baggage/pushback trucks to add to the experience. If your PC will allow you to crank up the settings, you'll get the fully featured terminals, but expect your framerate to tank while on the ground.The simulator also includes a strong and (in my opinion) somewhat underrated set of missions, which are VERY well voice acted and feel incredibly realistic. I strongly advise anyone who buys this to not only enjoy the Free Flight mode, but also to play some of the missions. They range from extremely easy hand-holding missions in Ultralights to challenging air races in stunt planes, along with everything in between. My favorite part about the missions is that whenever the writers needed a guiding voice for the player, they carefully wrote a believable character into the mission who helps you with your task, rather than having a voice from above tell you what to do in every mission (you only hear this voice in the tutorial missions) or simply having written on-screen dialogue boxes instruct you, like most other flight sims out there. There is a LOT of content here, which is what sets FSX apart from its competition.Now, while FSX is a great sim, it's still 8 years old. There are some worthy alternatives out there, probably the most famous being X-Plane, which, unlike FSX, is still being actively developed. It runs better, but the world you're playing in doesn't match the complexity and visual fidelity of that of FSX. The planes look and feel more realistic, but the game is not necessarily technically superior to FSX. From an objective standpoint FSX takes the crown when it comes to gritty realism in most cases because of how the game is programmed from a simulation standpoint. These games may look similar onscreen, but under the hood they are completely different. FSX handles almost everything physics related by computing complex mathematical equations based on data tables for each aircraft, whereas X-Plane was literally born as a wind tunnel simulator, which sets it ahead of FSX on the tech side in some respects. You can easily make your own plane in X-Plane, since the physics are handled by its wind tunnel engine, whereas in FSX you need to go in with a full knowledge of how it will perform to do the same. It took the ACES team years to perfect the physics of each aircraft, some of which would carry over from previous iterations of Flight Simulator because it took such meticulous research to get the tables perfect. That being said there is a lot of free content available online for both games. And yes, from what I can tell legacy mods function in the Steam Edition of FSX.Now for the subjective part of the review. You have been warned.While I was very fair in my above comparisons between FSX and X-Plane, it's worth mentioning that X-Plane isn't all it's cracked up to be with regard to actual content. You'll often see advocates online telling you to ""come into the future"" because FSX is outdated. If the future means paying for individual airports and aircraft models, count me out. Let's talk about X-Plane's own Steam release. The product itself, which is fully priced mind you, is essentially just the game engine with a few mediocre airplanes and Tarmac-only airports. Just abandoned parking lots (on par with respectable mobile sims like Infinite Flight...wow). I've been told that you need to pay for additional content, which in my opinion is very unjustified here. I can see this model being fair in sims like Rise of Flight, but here? Thankfully X-Plane has a rather nice free modding scene, so that may be a saving grace. Furthermore, the full install is 80 gigabytes. This is probably the result of distrust between the devs and their autogen engine, since, unlike Microsoft, their map data wasn't acquired internally (FSX uses MS's own satellite imagery, which means ACES, the Microsoft game studio behind FS, was inherently more familiar with the data and how they could use it to apply automatically generated scenery). It's a shame the Flight Simulator series isn't still around to offer some serious competition, because X-Plane currently dominates the non-militaristic subsection of the flight sim genre, and it's got a ravenous community to defend its every business decision. The engine is good and runs well on most PCs built within the past few years, though it is a huge memory hog. FSX isn't, but its utilization of modern CPU configurations is embarrassingly poor.In conclusion, if you're going into the simming genre hoping for a fully featured, fleshed out flight sim that's excellent for beginners and is the absolute pinnacle of its genre (the FS series is over 32 years old!) FSX is a great choice. This is the only official version of FSX still sold today, and it's very unusual to see a product like this from a company like Microsoft show its face on Steam. Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition, while considerably outdated, is a welcome addition to the wonderful collection of flight simulators available on Steam.			"

												A slightly re-vamped version of the 2006 classic.  Dovetail Games have agreed distribution rights with Microsoft for this flight-sim and released it on Steam late 2014.  Along with the distribution rights they have been permitted sufficient access to the code to allow them to adjust and optimise the sim to better suit todays PC.  That having been said, this is still a single threaded a poorly optimised 32-bit application and even the most powerful of todays PC's struggle to attain ""high"" frame rates, especially when you start to include a few add-ons.That brings me nicely on to the add-ons.  Due to the program being around since 2006 there is an unbelievable amount of DLC available for this sim, before you reach for your credit card though, make sure that the supplier specifies that it is compatible with FSX Steam Edition or the add-on is listed in the known compatible add-ons on the community page.There are some very good add-ons that are free, there are some exceptional add-ons that cost quite a bit of money (A2A Simulations, PMDG) and there are add-ons that are free for limited functionality or can cost for full functionality (FSUIPC). The key is research, have a look at Jordan Kings Freeware Video to get an idea of what is possible for nothing more than bandwidth. Alternatively you can very quickly rack up a £100 or more spend and still think there is room for improvement (REX, Orbx).A final word about add-ons. FSX requires you to generally get your hands dirty when adding features, if you don’t know your “%appdata%” from “My Documents” make sure you have fully researched the product you intend to buy and ensure you are comfortable with the installation procedure before you cough up the dough for it. This isn’t the case for the DLC that can be purchased from Steam, though I have to admit, most of the Steam DLC doesn’t appeal (see edit at the bottom).Regardless of whether you stay with the stock program or buy enhancements, the core sim can give hours of enjoyment if you have an interest in aviation. Users range from the complete novice that has only sat in row 14F of an A320 (me), to fully licensed pilots (so it must be OK).Although not a requirement, a joystick is recommended as well as a bit of patience and a lot of reading. You can jump into a Cessna 172 and lark about, or you can plan a flight for the same plane and follow, as close as can be reasonably expected in a 2006 sim, required procedures and protocols.  If, for example, you buy a PMDG add-on you have to calculate the fuel for the plane based on the number of passengers and their luggage, then you have to program the flight management computer and select your route, waypoints, approach etc. It must take 20 minutes or more to get to a point where you can actually start the engines! Alternatively you can just jump into a micro-light and be flying over Friday Harbor in a trice, the choice is yours.Edit 18/12/15: DTG are introducing a number of add-ons that don't deserve my original comment. Examples are FTX Trees HD, REX Texture Direct 4, RAAS Pro, Accu-Feel and a couple of the aircraft.			"

												My God has this game has been improved!SHORT VERSION: Buy this game if you love flight sims, lots of missions and a stack of real to life scenery/weather/planes etc.  It will not be money wasted.LONG VERSION: Lifelong Flight Simulator fans will remeber the day when FS 2000 was released in that big cardboard box with a heatbound Pilot's handbook over 230 pages long; beautifully presented and well worth the buy.  Then, it seemed, when FSX came along, the fad was nearly over.  Releasing FSX Acceleration confirmed this, and the devs behind the Microsoft flight sim series were put out to pasture, where all the devs from closed studios are left to run free range.  Some survived the mass slaughter of 1874, but most, sadly perished.  Apparently, some now work for Dovetail and after a long time, we now have the Steam Edition of FSX to enjoy.Guys, you've done a fantastic job!In the original FSX, you would find that moving the camera around the plane was quite sketchy in that it would jump where it wanted most of the time, and there was noticable lag.  This is THE main problem with older games when played on newer systems - GPUs as powerful as those today were'nt dreamed of when those games were developed.  They knew not of 1920x1080 and, as such, the software has to do the best it can nowadays.  FSX-SE has addressed that by ensuring that there will never be lag again.  Running this on a GTX 770, whilst it powers 3 screens; not a single instance of lag in display.  I will say this though, as this is a game that wasn't really designed for 1920x1080, just remember the old Windows Alt+Enter trick, and you'll be fine.Back to the lag, the controls no longer display laggy instances, and as soon as you move your joystick/mouse/gamepad, the plane reacts, with such precision, you wouldn't know you were in a simulator until you see the pixelated ground you're about to crash into.  Airports were great and really well designed in FSX, but now they have had a bit of a revamp, so expect some sharper images.In general, the game has been VASTLY improved, and, as a private pilot myself (before I lost my license due to the UK government getting scared of diabetics flying planes and insisted that every diabetic pilot or ATC personell be summarily fired) I love being able to get back behind a flight stick and rudder.  This game is also great for the casual plane nut, as there are so many missions to choose from, all ranging from the VERY basics (which will get you up in the air and give you an understanding of how a plane actually works) to the INSANELY hard (engines on fire, having to fly 60+nm in a snow storm without engines in a 747-700).  You can change realism settings, set failures and faults to happen at a specific time, location or randomly.  You can download real world weather (updated every 15 minutes) from WHEREVER you are in the world.I would say this, however, if you really are a proper ""casual"" flight nut, I'd recommend Microsoft Flight instead.A vast array of other great missions, planes, scenery etc are included in the game, however there is a plethora of other mods available and there have been since FS 98 way back when.So come one come all and enjoy this amazing revamp of a modern classic.

												Let me just start off by saying that I've owned about 4 copies of FSX:deluxe edition. No, I don't have 4 computers to play on, I just kept loosing all my copies. I even bought them for $10 at the MS store a couple years ago on sale. Those are gone, too. So, now this comes along at $5 (currently on sale). This is great. Just purchased and I won't have to worry aobut loosing this one. That being said, this is basically FSX:Gold edition with the exception of minor bug fixes, minor performance enchancements, change to the splash screen, and some Steam magic such as taking screenshots and multiplayer matchup.10/10 would buy again			"

												Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition is, as you probably guessed, a Flight simulator and a game which I have loved since it first came out back in 2006. In FSX: SE you get in to the cockpit of a number of different aircraft ranging from jumbo jets to ultralight aircraft in Free Flight or in a number of missions of increasing difficult made by the original development team all over the World. FSX: SE has always been a game that I have loved due to it providing me with an opportunity to fly aircraft I'm legally unable to fly (due to a long term health condition) and when I upgraded to a Windows 8.1 PC and found I could no longer play this game I was bitterly disappointed. When I heard about DoveTail taking over the game from Microsoft and updating it to work with Windows 8.1 I was over the moon and for the most part I was pleased with what I got when purchasing it through Steam.I'd also just like to say that despite only having 9 hours in the game on Steam I have at least 50-60 hours logged on the boxed edition.+Over 24,000 locations to visit which are all realistic based on the locations in 2006+24 Aircraft, including fixed-wing and rotary craft, each with a number of different variations+You can customise how realistic the game is ranging from a relatively easy game to a very realistic flight sim+DoveTail did a fantastic job at increasing performance and making it work on new operating systems+It's very easy to get in to thanks to its fantastic tutorials and increasing difficulty+A wide variety of missions ranging from simple cargo delivery missions to emergency landings after complete engine failure+Multiplayer works again, I've never played it myself but I know a lot of fans of the series were very happy to see this+A huge modding community (most mods are considered third party addons and do cost money)+FSX: SE includes the Acceleration addon pack which was developed before DoveTail took over+A huge number of hotkeys for the vast number of different controls in this game+Very good settings menus which make it incredibly easy to customise your FSX: SE experience-The graphics, scenery, flight models etc. still look just as bad as they did when the game first released 7 years ago, this could have something to do with DoveTail's deal with Microsoft but it's still very disappointing-The DLC that's being pumped out by DoveTail is both overpriced and according to other reviewers not particularly high quality which is bitterly disappointing as I wanted high quality first party addons-Despite being called 'Steam Edition' it has zero Steam integration, that means no cards, achievements, workshop or Cloud support-The SDK and modding tools have been patched out of the game, my guess is DoveTail don't like the fact that no one is buying their addon packs in favour of the vast number of far better quality addons available elsewhereWorth a mention:-I play this with a combination of a flight stick (with hotkeys) and keyboard for less important operations and I can't imagine it playing particularly well with M&KB or Controller onlyVerdict:8Despite some flaws the Steam Edition of this game allows me to play a much loved game that I would not otherwise be able to play. Overall a fantastic flight simulator which gives easy access for people new to this kind of game while also providing a great experience for regular fliers or fans of Flight Sims.El K.			"

Getting started with flying This simulator offers a complete package for newcomers to the genre.Even without add-ons it's a nice looking game with a massive amount of content. Lots of different aircrafts and the whole world to explorer.With free and bought add-ons and special hardware it can be expanded and customised to your preferences. (There are amazing high quality simulation planes available.) Making it into a popular flight simulator with serious enthusiasts.But if you are getting started or are just a casual player you won't need that to enjoy this simulator. And important, it offers a good selection of tools to get started and learn how to fly.Missions (tutorials) To get in the air quickly there are tutorial missions showing you some of the basics.The missions offer somewhere to start within all the possibilities of this simulator and are a quick way to try out all the different types of planes with a little guidance in operating them.These missions touch on most of the available airplanes and different styles of flying. From basic take-off, taxiing and landing patterns, to flying sailplanes, helicopters, commercial traffic, air-racing and flying from aircraft carriers. The first tutorial missions will be easy for beginners but the more advanced missions keep offering you a challenge as you improve your flying abilities.Nice about the first tutorial missions is that they tell you where to look at in the environment based on real world aviation skills. The briefing screen for the missions also tells you which articles to read for more detailed information about the current mission.Learning Centre – Library These articles can be found in the Learning Centre, a big library with documentation about everything concerned with flying and the planes. All edited to giving you real world information and the link with the implementation within the simulator.Learning Centre – Lessons Then there are the flying lessons. For me the best part to get into flying.There are study materials available for the school and guided lessons, by an actual flight instructor! It's almost like a real flying lesson, where the instructor gives you part of the controls and you can keep practicing to get the hang of flying and, important, landing an airplane. Well, you don't need to read everything. You can pick most up listening to the instructor. But it's there and I think it’s good and useful in-depth information.Controls This game offers support for almost any type of controller. And you can add many devices simultaneously for separate tasks. I've seen people using a racing wheel. And there are fully functional cockpits being build and connected to this game.But to get started you won't need much.Keyboard: Not immediately intuitive, but after a short learning time it’s doable. I used to fly (FS2002) with the keyboard, it (still) works fine for normal flight, just be careful with fast/aggressive planes. And unless you build yourself a complete cockpit you'll use it for the special commands. Although many can be applied using the mouse in the in-game cockpit.TIP: don't just press the keys, TAP them and be patient about it. A plane doesn't react immediately and pressing a key to much/long will make it move fast and hard to control.Mouse: I haven't done it yet, but you can use the mouse to steer the plane.Controller: Now I tried using a Logitech F710 (it pretends to be a Xbox 360 controller). And it works surprisingly well. It is already preconfigured and the default settings offer the basics to start flying. For basic flying I'd say it might be even easier to use than a joystick, especially for helicopters.Joystick: I only have experience with a basic joystick with twist for rudder and an analogue throttle. It's a little more realistic and the throttle is great.Just as with the add-ons: If you want to and have the budget you can make it as advanced as you like. But it isn't necessary at all.Mouse: Besides using the mouse to manipulate the controls in the (virtual) cockpit you can also use it to fly. (Toggle with Ctrl+Y) You'll just control the stick, but it's quite easy to use. This gives you good control, even with a laptops touchpad. Just keep track of the position of the small cross on your screen and remember the planes movements are indirect and most planes are a bit slow to respond.Btw. Instructions on using the different controls and most anything else can be found in the Learning Centre.DLC My personal note on the currently available dlc on Steam.These seem consistent with the base quality of the FSX. But you can find higher quality planes and scenery for free and you can create great flight plans in Free Flight.I think they are a bit expensive and you'll probably won't need the extra content they offer.I'd say: only buy them if you want to support the publisher for the work they do in maintaining this game.And who knows what great DLC they'll add in the future.Closing statements And then there are so many aspects of the game that I haven't touched yet. If you get into it you can go as far ... well really far with added content, multiplayer etc. There is just so much more available. But, my main point, you don't need that to have lots of fun playing and learning with this simulator.			"

												I'm going to give this a ""Thunbs Up"" just because I flew FSX waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay before it ever got here and I love FSX but I do have one complaint so far about this Steam version and that would be the fact that this version can NOT be loaded or played at all if your NOT logged in online on Steam. Now come on Steam & Dovetail, that's not gonna fly with folks like me who own almost 100 games on Steam and they all can be played in off line mode so I hope they get that bug fixed soon before I have to take my ""Thumbs Up"" back!

												I'm writing this review, because of some people who said this game sucks, because of the hard controls.So, this is a plane SIMULATOR! Anyone know what's that? S-I-M-U-L-A-T-O-R! Of course it will be hard to learn. The real pilots spend around 1 year of learning in the simulators, before their first real flight. And yeah, don't worry, this is not a fully real simulator.Let's talk about Boeing 747-400. It has the most basics controls you need, like flaps and throttle, aircraft lights and anti-ice system and many more. I just want to say it's not that so hard like in a real aircraft, where you need an hour of preparation before flight, don't worry. It takes 10 minutes for me to set everything for takeoff. And if you wonder how many hours it takes for me, before landing in extreme conditions for first time - 24 hours. It's hard, trust me, but not impossible.Another thing: It's not impossible to play without a joystick. As I said you need time for practise. I play with a keyboard and I have 140 hours, as you can see.It's not that so hard, you need time! Some people who are buying this game are like: ""Oh yeah, I bought a flight simulator. It will be easy to fly.""; And then in the game: ""OMG, this is so stupid game, I can't even takeoff."" Then uninstalls and write a negative review.I don't know why they are buying a simulator and want things to happen fast and easy. As the beginning of the review - this is a SIMULATOR! There are so many games, where to get flying you need to push only one button, like GTA, you know.UPDATE 28.09.2015: If DTG won't stop with these DLCs, the game itself will turn into the next DLC Simulator 2015 after the disappointment with TS 2016, but I still recommend it.UPDATE 04.02.2016: Yep..... DTG didn't stop and there it is... over 1400 euros for DLCs.....IMPORTANT!!!: DTG IF YOU ARE READING THIS THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU DID TO THIS GAME, BUT THESE DLCs ARE COMPLETE MADNESS! WTF! DO YOU REALISE YOU ARE ABOUT TO BREAK ONE CLASSIC GAME? Oh, and you know what? I CAN GET THEM ALL FOR FREE! THERE ARE SO MANY SITES OUT THERE! SERIOUSLY, YOU ARE OUT OF CONTROL! WAKE UP AND STOP DREAMING ABOUT GETTING MORE MONEY! YOU CAN STILL MAKE THIS GAME BETTER, EXEPT TS 2016, WHICH IS ALREADY DEAD SINCE 2012.....			"

												The FS SDK has been surgically removed from this release quite deliberately and secretly and Dovetail games are misleading people into thinking it's there.From the stickied post in forum : ""Existing FSX Owners, check here first ""What changes have you made in FSX: Steam Edition from the Microsoft-supplied boxed version of FSX? This is a re-release of FSX Gold Edition so you should not expect dramatic differences. However, we have updated it to include all standard Steam functionality, we’ve removed CD checking and combined the components of Gold Edition into a single installation. The major change we've made is in replacing the now-defunct GameSpy multiplayer systems with Steam features, enabling multiplayer to work seamlessly once again. Our aim in this first instance has been to ensure that the software will run for as many people as possible rather than radically improving or updating it.Gold Edition has the SDK.			"

												Owned FS98, FS9 and now FSX:SE (did not own the original boxed FSX).I have no problem with the game.  Runs OK.  However,  I would like to update my local airport as it has has had a runway extension and new terminals in the last few years .  As it is a smallish local airport it is unlikely to be updated by anyone else so I would like to do it myself.  However, Dovetail Games REFUSE to release the full SDK, including the executables, even though they state that the Steam edition is exactly the same (albeit improved) as the original FSX Gold Edition which also included the Deluxe Edition and the Excelleration Expansion Pack.  This original boxed edition INCUDED the FULL SDK.  The DTG released Steam edition does not.  For their dishonest selling a product that is not as described, I give them a thumbs down.			"

												First off. THIS IS NOT A GAME! -There is no Explosions-There is no Deaths-There is no graphic crashes-There is no winning or losing-You will have a HORRIBLE experience if you play this on anything other than a computer (cell phone, tablet) with a joystick, yoke and other airplane periphials.If you need any of the above, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. This is a simulator. Real airline pilots use this simulator for training. If you are new to the flight simulator world (i have been flying MSFS since version 1.0 in 1980) then welcome aboard and remember the 4 points above. Most of all remember THIS IS NOT A GAME!Now on to my review, lol: I am little late to the game but I had to post how EXTREMELY pleased I am with the Steam version of FSX. Dovetail really did a good job working out all of the kinks. I have been trying to run the FSX boxed version since it was released. Bought more powerful computers and still have never been able to run FSX successfully. And successfully means flying a whole route from gate to gate without crash. Ive always foind myself tweaking the settings and searching the internet to figure our how to get it right... Because surely Microsoft wouldnt release a product that only works on some systems right?! Well i never got it to work. I have been flying on FS9 instead which is VERY stable. The problem? None of the latest and greatest addons are compaitable with FS9. GrrrEnters FSX-SEI have done several long distance flights this past week without one crash or hang up and frame rates are awesome. All of MY addons are compatable. I have several payware airports and payware planes, all work without a problem. If you are still having issues with your boxed version of FSX or find yourself constantly tweaking the settings to get somewhat optimal flying performance then you should give Steam version a go. You will be pleased! There is not much if anything different visually between the boxed and SE except framerates. So if you are NOT having a problem with the boxed version, you can stick with that. But for the vast majority of people who are banging their heads on the desk trying to get FSX to work. This is your answer. Good Job Dovetail			"

												I'm a real-life CPL pilot, and I grew up with the Flight Simulator series. Flight Sim 2000 was the high point in the series. As for X, well... it's pretty good, but back in '06 it was very taxing on even the best systems of the time. I bought a bunch of aircraft from Carenado, PMDG etc and some of the aircraft are so detailed (the Precision Manual 747 was the worst back then) that a state-of-the-art PC (back then) ran at 40 FPS on a good day. Many years have passed and most of us, pilots and simmers alike, have moved on to the competitor (X-plane). The transition wasn't too hard for me as I had some experience with X-plane during IFR sim training in a certified Seneca simulator with instructor, instruments, flight deck etc. Personally, I prefered MS Flight Simulator to X-plane for personal use. Flight Sim is very straight forward, has a large community and feels good in a home computer. Alas, a third party developer bought the rights and gave us a 'renewed' Flight Simulator X. I was thrilled. It's been a long time since I've had a flight stick or quadrant at home, but I was too excited to wait for a proper set-up and made the purchase anyway. It's been nine years, my computer is fantastic (running the latest games effortlessly), thus I expected to experience Flight Sim X in a whole new way. Boy, what a huge disappointment...They took the boxed version of Flight Simulator X, recompiled the nine years old code for modern systems, and released it to the public. The bugs are all there, and new ones have been introduced as a consequence of running a nine years old game in modern systems. The support is the worst. Dovetail Games will refer you to Microsoft for support, even tho they're the ones putting up the game for sale. I'm not even sure they're allowed to make changes to the code itself. Your third-party airplanes? Not sure, as I haven't tried to install anything yet simply because I can't get Flight Sim to work for more than 20-30 minutes at a time. It crashes to the desktop CONSTANTLY. Again, zero support. I've tried the forums, but all I got was a bunch of good-natured fans trying to help me out. You'll find unofficial solutions here and there on the internet, but nothing worked for me. Eventually, I was told by some angry fan that it was my system's fault. I can only laugh at the suggestion, seeing as this is a perfectly well cared for computer, running games such as Arma III (a VERY taxing game indeed) under Ultra at a steady 100+ FPS, zero glitches. Same goes for every other game in my library. Flight Simulator X is broken, and hopelessly so, given the nature of Dovetail's business pact with Microsoft. Avoid the frustration. So far, it's been nothing but a huge let down for me.For the first time in a very long time, I am forced to write: I DO NOT recommend this game.			"

												I am so glad that Steam picked up MS Flight Sim X! I've been using MS Flight Sims since the first version I can remember.  When Microsoft dropped support, I did switched to Lockheed's Prepar3D, which uses a upgraded FSX engine with DX11, but I'd much rather support FSX under Steam!FSX really needs Steam Workshop for all its many add-ons as DLCs, which always have been a real pain to locate, purchase, and install. Steam would so much improve things for the Flight Sim World!Fortunately, all the addons I have are compatible with both Prepar3D and FSX, and they all seem to work fine with this Steam version. I may have to run one of the Registration Fix tools like TweakFS, to use a few aircraft again in Prepar3D, but I haven't had any problems so far and I am used to fixing my simulator installations and getting addons working.I recommend the REX Real Environment Xtreme, Orbx Airports & Terrains, Just Flight's Air Hauler and REX Latitude add-ons, which greatly enhances the visuals and gives you something fun to do hauling cargo around the world, managing the Cargo Company and its aircraft. Someone please make these as DLCs ASAP! Orbx also has a few free demos of a great starting airports and terrain regions to fly in.I look forward to updates of FSX to DX11 for Better Graphics, More Missions for More Things To Do, More Flight & Instrument Training, Ground & Tower Operations, Steam Achievements, Trading Cards and other improvements!**NOTE:  If you are having problems with add-ons, it is most likely an registry issue and/or configuration files located in user windows profile directories.  If you check my screenshots, I have multiple addons working concurrently: REX, Orbx and Traffic X including a premium aircraft with everything maxed.  Everything should run perfect in the Steam version, it does take a lot of effort sometimes to get your simulation environment right.  There are guides in the Prepar3D community that address many problems I see people having with the Steam version.Remember:  FSX is NOT really a game, it is a professional simulator used by real world pilots to train.  Though many flight enthusiasts enjoy it as a game due to its complexity!			"

												I have been a real world aviator for the past 18 years. Back when I was training for my Instrument Rating, MS Flight Sim became more than just a game. It was an essential tool in the flight bag that helped solidify essential skills needed to fly in the IFR world. The end result of which saved me time and money obtaining my rating. I basically taught myself IFR flying. It was essential to understanding VOR radials and ADF tracking and intercepts.After flying for a career for the past 8 years I'd never thought I'd have use for MS Flight Sim ever again. However, recently I dusted off my old copy of MS Flight Sim to help prepare for my Boeing 737 type rating. A company designed a fairly accurate version of the 737 with the correct system logic. It even included a fairly accurate FMC. Once again MS Flight Sim proved useful and was essential to understanding the systems of the 737 and cockpit flows. Hopefully the Steam version will allow for these add-ons. My advice to anyone using MS Flight Sim as a training tool would be to treat it as just a game until you start instrument training and be prepared for many misunderstandings. My previous four year’s experience as flight instructor and chief flight instructor has taught me that those used Flight Simulators during their Ab Intio training developed bad habits that needed to be trained out of them. Once you have completed your Ab Intio training, it can be an excellent training tool. "

												I originally wrote a long-winded review on this title, with the developer actually replying in an obviously scripted manor.  Needless to say, in the months since nothing has changed.  Starting out with the game, don’t let the title fool you because this new ""edition"" is the same Flight Simulator X that’s been around for over 10 years.  There is nothing additional added.  There are no additional default aircraft, the scenery isn't better, it' only some minor workarounds that have been done.  Let me explain that further…While Microsoft is still the developer of FSX, Dovetail Games has taken over as a “publisher” for this title.  Now, it might sound a little unclear but here’s the facts surrounding Dovetail’s involvement.  They’ve done some work on the multiplayer aspects of the game, making it once again “functional”.  Not that you couldn’t play multiplayer before Dovetail got involved.  You just needed a 3rd party program and a little instruction from a Google search to get connected with your friends.  Now, due to Dovetail's involvement, that method of multiplayer has been blocked so they can provide a centeral hub for all games.  They also made the game “Steam Compatible”, which is another way of saying they modified the game so DLC could be directly installed by Steam.  That said…When you discuss the core of the game, nothing has changed.  The scenery is still the same.  The default aircrafts are still the same.  The interface is still the same.  It’s all the same as it was 10 years ago.  Nothing has changed or been added to this new ""edition"".  There have been no noticeable improvements, quite the contrary.  New bugs have crept up that cause the game to occasionally crash.  This coming from someone who has had the original FSX since it originally launched.  So why would Dovetail resurrect a game that is 10 years old when Microsoft itself doesn’t see fit to keep on the store shelves?To answer that question you only have to browse other simulation titles by Dovetail.  The company is the kings of DLC content.  Look at their Train Simulator 2016 game.  There is very little content included with the actual game yet the cost of all the DLC for it, 232 items, comes in at close to 3 THOUSAND DOLLARS!  The DLC for Flight Simulator X is a little more tame, only around $650 for all of it, but that's still fairly ridiculous considering nothing has been added to the new ""edition"".  THIS is the main focus of Dovetail bringing FSX to Steam.  It’s not to make improvements to the game.  It’s not to fix the glaring bugs they've added and fix the outdated graphics.  It’s to sell DLC so they can make a quick buck off an old (and relatively dead) title.If you already own Flight Simulator X… DO NOT BUY!If you’re on the fence… DO NOT BUY!If you expect new scenery… DO NOT BUY!if you expect more aircraft… DO NOT BUY!There is ONLY ONE reason you should ever consider buying this Steam version.  It’s the same reason I bought it.  Because I already have a large library of free FSX content that I’ve gathered over the past years, my DVD’s were damaged somehow, and this is the only way I can now reinstall FSX.  Don’t let my play-time fool you.  If I could have avoided buying this buggy Steam version and stuck with my original FSX, I would have.			"

												It's finally here! I first heard from PCgamesN website that there were plans to bring FSX to steam with stability and performance improvements and have been anxiously checking since. This was about half a year ago and finally the wait is over and with such a great intro price! This is basically FSX Gold with said improvements. Although it's early days, steam workshop/store addons/DLC WILL be added down the line. I've not tried any of my existing addons with this installation yet but I'll update the review once I have to let you know of compatibility and if there are any issues or things to know. All I can say is I'm so glad this iconic, timeless masterpiece is finally here and for them to have worked on the performance issues? Just an absolute pleasure! (Although by now, most of our rigs can run it perfectly anyway however start throwing addons into the mix such as REX, Weather systems, OrbX environments, highly detailed custom aircraft etc... well, we'll see!) Stay tuned guys!Update: I can confirm my addons are so far working perfectly! Christmas has surely come early guys and girls!			"

												FANTASTIC SIMAWFULL WORK BY DOVETAIL CHEATING THE CUSTOMERS!They did not advertised the game like requiring a internet connection every start up. On the FAQ the said (MONTHS AGO) that they would have OFFLINE MODE IMPLEMENTED.BUT already now after MONTHS nobody knows anyithing about itI don't think it would be an issue if they really wanted to implement this because almost all the games i have installed on steam already have an offline mode.They simply doesn't care for customers and their needs. I don't have an internet connection in every places i go but i want play this game because i purchased it!ALSO they promised costant follow up and updates, but very little is coming up.It is really a shame because the game is great and infact people is still spending thousands euro on its add on, i believe that with more effort by DOVETAIL this sim could be a best seller on SE.WHAT A SHAME DOVETAIL!

												Microsoft Flight Simulator X came out October of 2006 and it's still one of the best flight simulators around. I have hundreds of hours on the original and plenty on here. The first thing I am going to say to anyone reading this review is, DO NOT expect to be able to do everything if you know nothing about aviation. Many reviewers call FSX a game in their reviews and FSX is NOT a game, it's a simulator, simulating the complex world of aviation. If you know nothing about aviation, do not expect to be able to fly an IFR flight using VOR or GPS navaids and shoot an ILS landing. FSX takes a lot of research to figure out, luckly they have a learning center to help newbies out. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about the sim. Yes, it's almost 11 years old, so, it doesn't have the best graphics in the world, nor does it have the best planes. Luckily, during the 11 years of this sim's life, people have been making addons for FSX, including: planes, scenery, textures etc. You can make this sim look nice and feel realistic for free, you don't have to pay for the insanely overpriced DLC Dovetail offers on the Steam Store, my FSX looks great and I only paid for the sim, nothing else.If you're willing to look past the 11 year old sim and put in the effort to learn about the world of aviation (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) then flying on FSX can be one of the funnest things you'll do, aside from flying for real. I got FSX about 7 years ago, I'd never really looked into aviation before, never played a flight sim before, but, once I got an idea of what I was doing, I fell in love. Currently, I'm a licensed Private and Commercial pilot with my Multi-Engine and Instrument ratings and I'm working on becoming a Certified Flight Instructor. Had I never gotten FSX, who knows what I'd be doing right now.			"

												My personal opinion about this game or simulation software (whatever you prefer). I'm using FSX since 2006, and honestly, it was a nightmare back than since there simply was no hardware you could buy for money which was able to run it in a way that it was playable. This lasted for approximately 3 years. During that time Microsoft released 2 service packs and Intel released the first generation  of i7 processors which finally allowed the game/software to become really playable. I'm always juggling between the terms game and simulation software. This is because to some users FSX is a game and to other users it is a flight simulation platform. What is the difference? Well, if you see it like a game, then FSX does offer you great missions which will provide you a great deal of fun during a few weeks. If you see it as a flight simulation software, then it will become more complicated. The reason is because you can start training for a real pilot licence with this software. But this will only be interesting if you try to do it right as closely as possible as real pilots do. The problem with this is that then it is no more about flying around, which by the way will become boring very fast. But then, you will have to learn the real rules of the sky and the aviators. The learning curve will be much steeper but so much more rewarding. There are some really good books on the market which are based on Microsoft flight simulator training which will guide you through the process. I am myself a real world private pilot and I started with Microsoft Flight Simulator back in 2006 and then started working on my real pilot licence in 2009. It did help me a lot, but I also caught some flaws by simming. The problem is that in the sim you mostly have only one screen and thus you tend to focus more on your instrument panel. In real world VFR flying you have to focus more on the outside of the plane in order to navigate. I was so proficient when I started flight training that my instructor asked me if I already had some flight lessons in the past. But he also caught me too often staring at my instruments, because I got used to it while doing flight simulation. You will for sure not be able to fly a real plane only with flightsim training, but it will help you a great deal to get proficient in procedures and radio navigation and lots of other things.But Flight Simulator X really starts to shine when you start to add quality add-ons. They bring FSX to a whole new level. You can add new weather engines, highly detailed aircrafts which do cost more than FSX itself but which allow you to operate them by the real airplane books. This is the case for general aviation airplanes as for airliners. But there is also a bunch of software add-ons which enhance the whole world of FSX. More detailed elevation meshes which cover countries, continents of even the whole world! The same is true for airports, roads, amd rivers which are much more detailed. You can buy add-on airports which look exactly like the real thing. Actually most of the large airports have been recreated in detail by add-on companies.Now you could ask yourself, but what do I get then in the Steam Edition, which is in my opinion nothing else than a MS FSX Gold Edition with a few optimizations and bug fixes. You do get a game/simulation software which tries to approximately simulate the whole planet earth, get a nice fleet of airplanes to start with. Yes, you will be able to fly in every country on earth. But only something like 40 or 50 cities and large airports have been recreated in more detail, which is already very pleasant. The other cities and airports in the world do also exist (well, most of them) but they are recreated in a more schematic way with landclasses and autogen, but lets don't get too technical.Today's hardware enables you to run FSX in a pleasant way. Since the two service packs which Microsoft did release plus the few optimizations Dovetail did, it should normally run in a stable way. I like Microsoft Flight Simulator X very much and this is why I have already plunged thousands of dollars (yes, you do read correctly) in add-ons and hardware in order to be able to fly as real as it can get in order to stay sharp for my real world flights. I have also bought some great hardware from Saitek and VRinsight which enable me to fly with a yoke, pedals and throttle levers, radio navigation stack. We nearly as I do in the real plane. So beware, if you become addicted, then it can become an expensive hobby :-)I like the fact that Dovetail now ported FSX on the Steam platform because the flight simulation community is lacking new adopters for years now, thus eroding the user base. The average age of a simmer tends to be in the mid forties and we could really use youngsters which come along to enhance the base of users. So if you dream of becoming a real world pilot or only want to have some fun, try it, I did at least never regret it.			"

												Don't bother with it when it's not on sale unless the developers get around to fixing the bugs that's plaguing the game. It's playable, but the terrain.dll crashes (there are quite a few threads about it on the product forum) make it impossible to have a long haul flight without disruptions.Best of all? the developers have yet to answer emails sent to them almost a month or 2 ago with regards to these very bugs.

												Where to start.  Well, the game itself is still pretty awesome even though its now nine years old.  I was never able to afford the VFR scenery add ons  when I played the game   originally.  I always wanted to buy the ones covering the UK to get  the better ground imagery, but   they used to cost around £100  for the UK set, so was really pleased to see  them released on Steam  today, and at what seemed a really good deal compared to their original price.  If you buy the pack, you basically get one of the   scenery packs free.   Unfortunately  I'm very disappointed.  I always though we got   satellite quality  imagery with these VFR scenery add-ons, but what I saw from my local airport (Woodford Aerodrome UK)  - my house is  directly in the flight path of the  runway.  Until last year before the   runway was closed we used to have our trees trimmed at the bottom of our garden  by the airport authority because they were  tall enought to cause problems with landing aircraft.  I know the surrounding country side like the back of my hand, but couldn't make out any land marks in game, nor from the nearby Manchester Airport.  Everything looks the same, with   cloned  houses and trees dotted liberally everywhere and the  grassland areas looking like desert.  I have all the graphic settings maxed out, but   apart from the  aircraft cockpits, everything else looks really dated.  Okay, it's nine years old, but  I  really thought the scenery would be better.  I don't think the  game is  worth £19.99,  and I think the total cost of  dlc so far (with some of it  on sale at between 25 to 50%) standing at over £100 for a nine year old game is    really way too much.  I wish Steam would support Microsoft Flight instead, which had amazing scenery, sadly  that doesn't work   any longer due to the GFWL connection.Personally I've got mixed feelings about  recommending this game.  If you love flight sims it's still a big thumbs up, but I'd definitely wait  till all of the dlc is 50% off or more.  If flight sims are not  your thing, I'd  leave this game alone, it'll  just  confound you.  I wish I could  give a thumbs up or down seperately for the  main game  and the dlc.  The game would still get a thumbs up, but the add-ons wouldn't.  There's a lot of free  custom stuff for this game, but I don't know yet whether it'll work   with Steam?Even though i've said  I think the game is now over priced, i'm still going to give it  a thumbs up, but with reservations.  I'll update when I find out if the free stuff  will work with the Steam version.			"

												To see new life breathed into the Flight Simulator genre is a great thing!This is a great release of the final installment of the iconic Flight Simulator Franchise.It is great to see it run very stably (is that a word?) on Windows 8.1, and some under the hood tweaks to make it run smoother.If you are expecting DX11 or something different from default then you are going to be disappointed. This is a digital distribution of the Deluxe Gold Edition with some minor improvements and addition of Steam Multiplayer functionality.Pros:It is more stableSome community bug fixes including uiautomation issues fixed as part of the installbetter memory managementWill still work with your existing add onsCons:Not backwards compatible for multiplayer to legacy versions of multiplayerShould you get it? Well this is the future of FSX so get it! Until we have a next gen simulator this is what we have!Go For It! Safe SkiesNovawing24 "

												Yes. Yes. Yes.I have owned FS9 and FSX:Gold and have flown hundreds of hours with my dad, and I have to say... They really fixed it! This simulator used to run terrible even on my current i5-3570k OC + GTX 970 build, even on Medium-High settings with no anti-aliasing. They really have fixed it as now I can get a solid 60+ FPS (on a 144hz monitor >.>) on Ultra with Dense Autogen scenery and Anti-aliasing.Well aside from the geek part of it, it is still really fun to play. It takes I'd say, 2 hours of training before you can pretty much fly the stock planes like a pro (given that you continue flying at least once every 2 days), which really isn't that much time at all.Still is a great game to play, really happy that most of the add-ons still work, and wow, multiplayer. Though the voice is a little choppy, still much better than GameStool. ^_^ Looking forward to future updates!			"

												Microsoft Flight Simulator X - the smash hit no one saw coming. A must have for any aviation enthousiast. Give yourself a challenge in missions, or hop into freeplay and fly anywhere, from the busy airports of London to a deserted strip in the middle of nowhere. Hop in a jetliner and fly from city to city, or get in a cessna and do some bush flights. with a great variation of planes, airports etc to choose from you'll never get bored. Be a lone wolf or hop onto multiplayer and play with friends and others, the choice is up to you! Whilst flying above the Australian outback, French alps or the carribean. Tons of freeware and payware addons to choose from. From new aircraft to stunning scenery. Works with keyboard, mouse, game controllers and yokes, not to mention TrackIR and multi monitor support. With great mod support and fantastic addons, this game remains fun and enjoyable for more than 10 years after release. Just buy it, then you'll understand.			"

												This is one of the best Flight Simulators. I used it first in 2010 and was fascinated by it's technical level of detail. You can change difficulty (realism settings) as soon as you learn to fly. On most difficult level you have to obey speed limits when retracting the gear or extending the flaps... Anyway, in 2013 I made my real pilot license and a lot of experience learned in FSX helped me to feel more comfortable in my real training flights. Things you can learn here are: purpose of different switches and gauges, terrain and radio navigation, communication basics, ATIS & METAR (weather reports). Things you should not think, they are the same (even with best realizm settings) - it is flying physics. Yes, it is very close, but not identical, but it is easy to learn, when you decide to get into real place. Cessna 172 with round instruments and version with Garmin 1000 is best plane to learn basics, for future real pilots.Also I advise to get the book ""Microsoft Flight Simulator X For Pilots: Real World Training"".

												Gold diggers - that's my opinion. The add-ons, which are nothing more than a bunch of markers, should be £0.99, and not £12.99 as they are. Even commercially available missions for original FSX are cheaper than this.I have original FSX with Accel and more than £500 worth of add-ons, and I bought this one, to see how is it going to be developed, but it looks like they've gone for fast return of investment only. I have already invested in X-Plane now with some more than decent add-ons, and will be completing my transition by removing this title from steam library at some point if nothing changes. Waste of money so far.PS: Look at the ""official"" reviews, it's like if it was a new title, which it obviously ISN'T. All dovetail did, and as it appears the reviewers are unaware of, is re-released the original FSX re-compiled for current versions of OS, and added few fixes - nothing else.			"

												As of writing this, I have played 17.5 hours in to Flight Simulator X. So in my experience playing this, I will give my review. (I highly recommend getting this with a joystick, I use a Logitech extreme 3d pro, it's cheap, and it works great.)What I like: There is no boundries to where you can go, from what I know, the whole world is your map. Each plane is almost spot on with the cockpit, whether it be gauges and where they're placed, to COMMS and Autopilot. Another thing I like is the amount of airports there are, there are about 24,000 airports, heck, it even has the very airports/airstrips in my home town, which surprised me because I don't live in a very big city at all. I've never flown a real plane before, let alone much experience in simulators, and I was able to pick up on this fairly quickly, the tutorials are easy, and not to complex, they explain a lot of what you need to know, so don't worry if you think you won't be able to to get a plane off the ground. The standard game itself has a large variety of missions, some for beginners, and some for pros. You can be very specific in free-flight, you can change time of day, weather, month, day, whatever, so if you like flying on clear days or in stormy nights, this game has it. I could explain a lot more that I like, but I don't want to make this review as long as a novel, so let's move on.Mixed opinions/dislikes: There isn't much negativity I can say about this game in my experience of playing, but there are some mixed opinions I still have for the game. There isn't a whole lot of planes, maybe it's because I bought the standard $25 edition, however there are some DLCs for the game that do add more planes, but they my cost you. The game isn't very fun nor immersive with just a keyboard, so it's recomended you get a joystick, it's not needed, but it will make this game a whole lot more fun and realistic.So there you have it, it's not as detailed as some of the other reviews I've seen for this game, but it's my best. Over all, if you like flying planes and helicopters, in a pretty realistic flying simulator, this is for you. To rate this, I would give this a fair 8.5/10, There isn't a huge amount of planes to choose from, but it should be enough. I haven't played multi-player yet, so I can't really say anything about that. Anyways, thank you all so much for taking the time to read my review!Also, I have a question you could answer in the comments, would this be good practice while taking real life flight school? Because my dad is starting to take flight school, so I want to know if this could help him learn to fly, so if any of you can say yes or no, please put it down in the comments, thanks!			"

												I was initially skeptical whether to buy FSX Steam, I suspected that the only change compared to the boxed version will be a different splash screen and a few new images. But I see HUGE performance improvement over the boxed version (Win 7 64-bit, intel Core i7 quad-core,  Radeon HD 7700, 2560x1440 + 1200x1600).  I hope that more improvements and updates will come. I was even able to trasnfer my logbook and rewards from the boxed version (using the same method as people use to transfer them when reinstalling boxed FSX, google it up). And the annoying switching to basic color scheme is gone.The only problem I had was that a few UAC messages appeared when selecting aircraft, I hope these will go away on subsequent plays.			"

												Still the better civil aviation simulator due to its extensive support with a vast selection of 3rd party addons. This means that although the base package is very dated, it can be easily improved with better scenery and aircraft for a more up-to-date and fun flying experience.Performance and PlayabilityThe base game works fine out of the box with Windows 10 and because it’s from 2006 it should run on the average computer without difficulty. However I found DX10 to be mostly broken on various graphics cards, its hit or miss whether it will work for you – if it doesn’t, DX9 mode will play fine. This is simply because the DX10 that came with the game was only a preview build rather than a full DX10 support.Another thing to note is that when you start installing lots of addons, the game does suffer from performance issues relating to the fact it’s a 32-bit. While there are no-shortage of community config file edit suggestions, the only thing that will really help is a really high end computer here (notably cpu etc.). To avoid issues, simply be wary about what you install as some scenery addons can be terribly un-optimized.NOTE: This Steam Edition is essentially the 'Gold Edition' of the game, which contains the base FSX and the Acceleration Add-on in one install. It also uses Steam multiplayer instead of Game-spy. I have however found this version does not contain all the SDK files which were found in the Deluxe edition of the game, but most of this can sourced with a few google searches. None of this really matters unless you are going to be developing content for the game or trying to install a really outdated add-on that doesn't work around the newer service packs.AircraftThe game comes with more than a dozen aircraft, ranging from airliners like the Boeing 737, bush planes like the Piper J-3 Cub, General aviation planes like the Cessna 172 Skyhawk, classic warbirds like the P-51D Mustang, and even some helicopters thrown in the mix such as the Robinson R-22 Beta II. All these come with detailed cockpits and various paint scheme options.

While this is indeed a reasonable selection of planes included for new pilots to the game, it has to be said that experience does improve considerably when getting 3rd party aircraft as these are not only better looking, but can feature more accurate flight models.MultiplayerMultiplayer works out of the box via Steam, is pretty easy to join and works well. However the game does not come with a dedicated server, but there are 3rd party hosting applications (Such as FSHost[www.chocolatesoftware.com]) that will fill this gap.Exploring during a group flight with friends is something I really enjoy, and one of the things that keeps me playing FSX. Free FlightIn Free Flight you can choose to spawn at nearly any airport in the world with the aircraft, time, and weather conditions of your choice. From here you can file a flight-plan or just fly wherever you want.

While the scenery included by default is global, it is strongly recommended you do replace it with either payware such as Orbx FTX[www.fullterrain.com] or freeware such as FreeMeshX[ninetwopro.com] as it is very lacking and not very accurate by default. With modifications it can become really nice to look at and will improve your enjoyment of the game.MissionsThere are dozens of included missions with the game, ranging from tutorials, to racing, to landing on an aircraft carrier! There is quite a varied selection here, with skill levels ranging from beginner to expert, and mission lengths of around 15 minutes, up to a few hours.

No career mode is included, just individual missions, but plenty to keep you busy here.ConclusionSo if interested in civil aviation or aviation in general then FSX is well worth the purchase, but do so under the knowledge that your experience will improve considerably when done so with 3rd party addons, even if freeware.GoodVaried selection of included aircraft (good, however not as good as payware)Steam multiplayerVast selection of payware and freeware modsGlobal SceneryLots of available missionsNot so goodIncluded aircraft flight models lacking (can buy payware aircraft that fly more realistic)Default scenery outdated (can be improved with freeware and payware)No included dedicated serverPossible performance issues due to 32-Bit			"

												I will tell you one thing about FSX Steam Edition: It runs much much better than the original FSX. I played and compared both editions on my old laptop (Core 2 Duo T9300 2.5 GHz , NVidia GeForce 8700M) and was delightedly surprised to find out that I was able to max more sliders and get higher frame rates than what I was able to achieve with the original FSX. The functioning multiplayer alone is worth purchasing this game. I am definitely enjoying the steam edition far more than I enjoyed the original FSX, and I will soon order my Saitek yoke and pedals to go along with it.			"

												A warning to all desk-top aviators / serious simulator enthusiasts who possess several top-quality paywares.For the hardcore and true fans/users of the original Microsoft Flight Simulator X, (especially those who use the top-notch and accurate simulation software from the Precision Manuals Development Group [P.M.D.G.] and Aerosoft), I warn you not to migrate to the Steam Edition because you will find your self extremely displeased with the several program incompatibilities that await to ruin all your hopes of flying on this new platform.Either purchase the original Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Gold Edition or hope and pray that soon, the major external paywares become compatible. Otherwise, ditch them all together and go for a Lockheed Martin Prepar3d license.Reviewed on the 4th of January 2015.			"

												What Dovetail has done for this game is truly amazing. A labor of love for sure. I spent well over 1,000 hours playing this game in my early to mid-teens, and it's something I'm at times ashamed of. I loved this game then but was constantly disappointed in the games ability to run on my machine due to the game's inability to play smoothly. Dovetail has done an excellent job working the bugs out of this game's code and I'm pleased to say that it's light-years better than before. To test how well Dovetail fixed the code I fired up the game and cranked those graphics sliders to the max (AI Vehicles left at default values). I was surprised! While pc gamer would complain that 30FPS in a video game is lame or uncool, I managed to stay at 30FPS with the limiter turned off while I flew a Bell 206 from O'Hare to the downtown area, and from there to Midway Airport. TL;DR They fixed it. Grab your joystick!""Test of Time""			"

												Don't look at my game time as I've played this game for countless hours, years ago. This is the Steam edition, Microsoft shut down their flight sim series because they thought it would be a good idea to dip into the F2P market charging incredibly high amounts for plane addons.But this series is not dead, the Train Simulator devs have released this Steam edition, it is not just the standard game, it is actually Flight Simulator X GOLD Edition, meaning this Steam edition is the deluxe version of the game including the acceleration expansion pack.But now onto the gameplay, the game is great for various reasons. It's realistic flight models allows plane enthusiasts to enjoy realistic plane flight simulation, but this is also great for casual flyers who just want to relax with good scenery.Last but not least, this Steam edition has full integrated multiplayer support, which was fantastic before it was shut down.I highly recommend, even if you don't like flight simulators.

												If flying in any way interests you, this is a great game that offers A LOT of content for it's price, and it's not that hard to get up and flying. Though you do need having a joystick, the game doesn't works that well for keyboard/mouse flying.As for the ""pure realistic simulator"" thing, it could be true, but you can turn most realism off and not have to bother with most physics things, thus making flying very easy.The graphics were the best in 2005 but they do look a bit aged now, specially the ground textures when you're not flying very high, also there's no dynamic shadows and that modern stuff. A lot is left for your imagination, really. Also, even though you can fly anywhere in the world, there are no cities in great detail, you can go looking their signature buildings though, like the Eiffel Tower and the Liberty Statue, etc. It can be fun searching for them. You can learn a lot of geography if you want too.I'd say it is MORE THAN worth for the money, but it will require some learning on your side if you never played flying games before. There's a huge set of scripted missions that can be pretty fun and challenging: like flying through Hawaii in a small plane with a tourism guide showing you everything to patrolling the skyes in around a rocket launch with a military jet.  Also there are awesome tutorials that will get you started into the game. Almost every mission will have a voiced co-pilot pointing you out stuff, and that makes the missions feel very real and awesome.And if you want to get deeper into the game, there are thousands of mods that cover pretty much everything: graphical mods, physics mods, realism mods, whole countries and planes built in awesome detail, new missions, you name it. It can get as complex and complete as you want as long as you got the money to get the more cool addons. Looking at it that way, FSX is more of a basic engine you can build up to the highest possible standards. And that probably explains why there was no sequel built by Microsoft: FSX covers everything already. There are on youtube lot's and lot's of videos that show what some mods are capable, just try not to be discouraged into getting the game because of that though, it's is great in vanilla state anyway.

Also know that you will have to buy additional aircrafts, because the base aircrafs are really bad, and not realistic. I suggest the aerosoft airbus x to start with. It is reallistic, and enjouable to fly but it is not that hard. Also pmdg's aircrafts are really good. Have fun!			"

												I am a real world instrument rated pilot and use simulators for instrument practice. I have used all the microsoft versions all the way back to MS2000. I have hundreds of thousands of hours in these simulators. Since FSX came out, I have used both X-Plane 10 and Prepar3d. I currently use P3D. I downloaded this because it was $5 and saw that there are improvements. I also sent a gift to a few of my friends. since P3D isn't hobby grade, expensive, and a little bit more difficult to run smoothly. After about a half hour in the game I am excited about it. I'll be able to race F-18s against my friends again! I haven't installed any of my add-ons to this, and I probably won't. I am treating this as my ""game"" sim. It runs really smooth compared to what I remember from FSX. I am getting 30+ fps steady on a 4k monitor. This is a plug and play flight sim! With a decent joystick and adding trim, flap, and spoiler buttons, it really is something special. Dovetail did a great job bringing back this classic and although I will not use it for training purposes (it can) I will be using the multi-player often and think this was well worth the $5			"

												First off FSX has a huge fan base, although the game [simulator] was released way way back in 2006. This is supported by the fact that a 8 year old game has received ""Mostly Positive"" reviews so far with many people claiming to have aviation background praising it for being their all time favorite flight simulator. Don't be mislead however by this current status - it is more of a legacy feedback and does not fully represent what the Steam Edition actually is.I will skip all the positive aspects in my review. They have already been pointed out extensively by others and I do agree with many of them. I will briefly give you my reasons for voting it DOWN which for me outweigh easily all the positives.FSX:SE has has been licensed to the worst developer [acting as publisher for the current edition] who is in charge of creating the next installment under the brand name Flight Simulator. Why worst? Well – Dovetail has no interest in the community other than milking it continuously with DLC releases. SDK has already been cut out from FSX:SE which means that the community will not be allowed anywhere near to creating and sharing. It is clear that the current, as well as the future FS, will follow the same path of Train Simulator by allowing only licensed companies to develop and sell DLC. Dovetail has once again waived the finger at the enormous creativity that the community has – it is strictly business, m8s!At first I was very excited for the game coming to Steam. Even more so at the possibility of getting a new flight simulator in 2015. However after a short research it became apparent that I am not the target group of Dovetail. Have a look at the trailer of Train Simulator 2015 – the guy being brainwashed to buy it is a middle aged cash cow, looking to waste time and has money for 4000$ worth of DLC crap. Yes - **** *** to the people who actually CAN create and contribute to the development of the game. They do not bring money and without money Mr. Cameron would not come again to our offices to praise us for creating worthless jobs.The potential of this simulator is to be the definitive open world exploration game. If it were to have the right developer the community would jump right in and fit a detailed copy of Earth together with the whole aviation industry inside.Thumbs down for the lost potential – this game will develop to be yet another epic failure.PS: Dovetail, don't give me your copy paste developer response – your propaganda tactics belong strictly to the PR department archives.Valve, please nurf their damage control options – it is shocking to see them spamming negative reviews.

Though the dlc are a bit expensive and there are alot, is not as bad as train simulator, the planes move very realistically and you can alter how realistic it is the graphics aren't the best, the terrain graphics are very low but you may notice it because you are 30'000 but the planes are ok and the nodding community is really good, allowing more planes and skins for them. The game is still good for pilots, though maybe spending a bit to get some better graphics.			"

												I have over 3500 hours flying experience on Microsoft Flight Simulator X, most of it on the old Classic/Boxed edition. Not surprisingly, I recommend it, and it's good to see a new generation of pilots coming through with this Steam edition.But it's not for everyone. If you want a storyline, either a basic narrative or one that's supplemented with downloadable content, it's not for you. If the words ""open-world"" and ""sandbox"" send you running, it's not for you. If you don't want to create your own goals and activities, it's not for you.But if you like exploring both your own imagination and the 200 million square miles we call ""Home"", you couldn't wish for better. If you like perfecting your abilities and maybe even developing them into real-world skills, you could do worse than try it out. Or if you just enjoy socializing with other flying enthusiasts, you'll find there's a whole bunch of active communities out there that use Microsoft Flight Simulator X.			"

												I have been a Fan of Microsoft Flight Simulator for a long time. My first version was Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, then Flight Simulator 2004, after that Microsoft Flight Simulator X. I dint get the Steam edition until I went to FlightSimCon 2015. I knew that Microsoft had stop supporting FSX and it was not window's 10 compatible, so I kept my old computer just for FSX and everything else was on my other Rig. While at FlightSimCon a representative from Dove Tail was there, and she was talking to me about FSX steam edition. She gave me a free download card and asked me to give it a try. Now the reason why I was unsure about making the switch, there is a lot of third party products for this Sim, that I paid for over the years of playing Flight Sim. After downloading, I noticed that the Sim was the same as the original edition. Many of my add-on were able to be installed and worked!!!. needless to say I was very excited. Also steam has a lot of DLC for FSX as well. Some for beginners and some for more advanced simmers. All in all I will recommend this for anyone who wants to get into a Flight Sim ""game"". FSX is able to take you a long way. It has great starting base and ability to keep challenging you as your skills progress.			"

												Ok, FSX is great and all, but lets face it, it is crap without addons in all honesty, the default planes are crap, the defualt graphics is a reminder of 2006, but with addons from like A2A, Alabeo, Carenado, PMDG, Aerosoft, and more, they bring this game alive, so thats the primary reason why I am gonna rate this up, but you need to dish out your wallet to have fun.

												I couldn't fly my planned cross-country solo flight from Phoenix to Yuma this morning due to weather.Came home, bought this, streamed my flight on Twitch, and had just as much fun.This is almost exactly FSX: Gold, with working multiplayer, more stability, no crashes, low ram requirements, and has pretty much the same file structure as the original (albeit in the SteamApps folder) so all of your addons should work. If you don't have FSX, buy it. It's worth the normal price. This is the simulator all other simulators look up to.			"

												This game is published by a different company, but this version is more optimized and even reintroduces multiplayer. You could easily play this on high settings with a mid-ranged CPU and GPU and still get at least 60 fps.If you have been a long time MS Flight Simulator fan, this is a must have especially with the current price. The Steam Edition only improves upon the CD version so you're not losing anything by getting this one.10/10 would simulate again.			"

												I know it says that I barely had any hours of playing this game, but playing this for over 150 hours in my childhood believe me I have expirience. Comparing FSX to the non steam version, the steam version is far more superior. The reason why I find this a must buy for airplane lovers out there is because this is a free open world simulator in the whole Earth, no boundaries like Xplane which is an over priced game. Another cool feature is that you can download addons, like maps and more aircraft from here: http://www.fs-freeware.net/. (Just search on youtube how to install the addons. Overall, I have been playing this since FS2000, I know a lot about this game and its a must buy for airplane lovers.  "

Doing this improves smoothness for many users.			"

												Dovetail Games studio has managed to really make FSX what it is meant to be again. As a fan of flight sims since a very long time, I can clearly say that FSX: SE is a lot better than standard and outdated FSX. The annoying bugs are fixed now with the exception of a few. As FSX: SE and X-Plane 10 are the most chosen flight sims, FSX: SE has outstanding quality of add-ons. High quality add-ons from big developers such as Aerosoft, PMDG, FlyTampa makes this game the reason to purchase it.Pros:-Great for starters-Great add-on developers & community-Outstanding add-ons such as PMDG 777, FlyTampa Dubai-A lot of possibilities to customize the game-Less bugs than old FSXCons:-Noticeable lags-FPS drops when using DirectX 11 options-Only a few bugs that needs to get fixedOverall a great flight sim and would recommend it for everyone.

												I will split this into a quick Good points Bad points and Neutral points, with a final conclusion at the end!Good:Highly Realistic simulation of aircraftGreat Price on offerActive Multiplayer communityLots of easy to follow lessons and missionsFree flight mode allowing you to plan and carry out your own flights.Millions of addons available on the web (I do not recommend any of the DLC aircraft listed on steam personally)Bad:To get realistic planes you are looking at around $30 to get the Airbus or $70 for the pmdg, the default ones simply aren't that great.Outdated graphics don't look that great.Extremely unoptimized, people with GTX titans can sometimes get 15 fps from a 10 year old game.CPU hogMultiplayer is quite unrealiableOverallMicrosoft Flight Simulator is still the leading product of Aviation simulation to this date, it is quite frankly amazing, but the fact that the market for a game like this is so small means that we will have to cope with the older engines as this is it as far as the FS series goes, however you cannot blame the devs for work done 10 years ago when this would of truly been a even more amazing example of simulation technology9/10 ""best simulator ever created"" "

												When you first start the game figuring out the controls can be a hassle and although flying without a joystick is possible, you are going to need one if you want to be able to fly properly. However after that is all figured out, it is an amazing game to play for professionals and people who just feel like goofing around. There are fun missions for times when you dont know what to do and tutorials for newcomers You are going to eventually have to buy some payware addons to really make the game shine, but there is plenty of freeware like project opensky aircraft if you dont have the money. The game does not appear to be hard on your computer and has a really good community. The graphics are ok considering when it was made, but they could be better especially the water and there is no wingflex for the default 737 and the gear doesn't tilt in the 747 which is a realism killer. The clouds also magically fade away when you get near them and there is no volumetric effect. I would definitely recommend this. After making the move from x plane to fsx i feel that the colours look my vibrant and less gloomy, better freeware, more payware, and the wingtip vortices add a nice feel. In terms of physics, i have never flown a plane myself but the physics in airplanes feel not completely realistic but pretty good in my opinion. The touchdowns feel a bit stiff but the overall flight doesn't feel ""on rails"" as others say. Helicopter physics do not feel very realistic. They are too stable and easy to control. For how i like to fly though the physics suit me perfectly and i personally dont want that realism but i know others will. The atc is easy to use and great for beginners aswell. No need to go all professional and download flight plans, all you need to know is where you are leaving from and where your destination is. All in all i give this game a 7/10 by itself but if you include the vast amount of addons i give this a 9/10 Even if you think a 7/10 is a bit low my opinion is to watch and read some reviews, look at some pictures, if youve already done that then my opinion is buy the game. For total honesty, there is an 88.5 percent chance you wont regret itBroken downphysics/7/10ease of use(not including controls) 9/10controls 4/10performance 9/10default aircraft quality 7/10default scenery quality 5/10			"

SummaryNOT WORTH YOUR MONEY.GameplayIf you're looking at this game because you played FSX and are getting nostalgia for it again, you'll find everything is exactly how it was on the original CD release. All the control mappings and defaults are the same. Flight controls are the same. Missions are the same. It's the same simulator that Microsoft released a full 10 years ago. The scenery is that outdated look and the engine still has the same fun problems (except for some compatibility issues, see ""Steam Edition""). The plus side is the base package can be run on max settings from even mid-range laptops with integrated graphics.Steam EditionLet me explain just why this game is now available on Steam. Dovetail Games (a pretty bad developer who sees itself as the god of sim-games) bought the rights to distribute FSX 2 years ago so they could make their own flight simulator. What they did for FSX was quickly patch some issues with compatibility for Windows 8/8.1 devices (and probably W10 too), so that it could run on Steam users' current PCs. Then they released it into the wild to earn cash to fund their development project for a new flight sim. I don't think they've touched it since.Warning!Lots of add-ons for MFSX will not work with the SE version for a number of reasons. The most basic is that an add-on refernces the standard installation directory, which is not where the SE version is installed. There are other reasons, but I can't really explain them.Persistent IssuesWhile Dovetail supposedly fixed some compatibility issues with newer operating systems, they certainly didn't fix all of them. In addtion, there are some things they should have fixed before re-releasing this on Steam. For example, the mission compass is still really stretched out on a monitor that isn't at a 4x3 aspect ratio. If you use DX10 rendering (better performance), you will never be able to go near an airport because of the horrid texture clipping that occurs. Every line and every asphalt surface that overlap encounter the WORST texture clipping with the DX10 engine. And if you go back to the default renderer, DX9, it then becomes impossible to see some pause menus (for example, rebinding keys mid-flight). Instead all you see is a black screen where you know there should be a menu. At that point, the only thing you can do is close the program externally. So you're basically forced to have massive texture clipping.ConclusionWhile I miss the days of FSX when it was new, I definitely am not reliving those now. The software has so many issues relating to newer operating systems that it makes the game unplayable on any modern platform (especially on the Windows 10 that Microsoft has been shoving down our throats). If I had a computer running Vista or XP (both no longer supported by Microsoft, fyi), this would be a worthwhile buy. However, to get this playable on a modern system requires you to dig around the web for solutions that involve manual edits to the game's source code/installation files. It's just not worth it.Footnote to Dovetail GamesDear Dovetail: how is it when you're given only a handful of things to do that you still manage to fall short? Even a cash grab should be well patched to work on a modern system. And you saw that your new flight sim/school was targeted at the wrong audience (I mean, what did you expect? The last good flight sim at its release was THIS, in 2006, or XPlane, which is quite a bit more complicated to use. Of course we're first in line for a new flight sim). And can we talk about how all of your other sims seem to tank in the reviews as well? You're not acclaimed for anything, and the only thing you're renowned for is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥people off with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ simulators. I.E. your train simulator should still be in the oven for optimization fixes. Your new flight school still has a lot of artifacts from the FSX engine like details popping into view and it's only got 2 planes. From all I've seen, you're one of the worst developers I know of. I WANT to enjoy a new flight simulator. Don't push out a release too early when you build the full thing. GET IT RIGHT. It's so frustrating when a developer is desperate for cash so they push a game out before it's ready. Then it never gets fixed and everyone hates it. Thing is, this is what it feels like you, Dovetail, are doing with EVERY SINGLE THING YOU MAKE.			"

												Ok, its finally on steam. So whats the difference, Not much. but no more game-spy, means no more multiplayer unless you run a VPN, but dovetail have taken care of this, by releasing it on steam. So multiplayer is back in.This is by no means a game, it is a hard core flight simulator, With over 10,000hrs on it my self (boxed version) you will see my hours soon rise quite quickly. But if you have the boxed version, why the steam version? i hear you ask. Good quesation. Well its simple really, as i have herd that dovetail intend on releasing new add-ons/expansions for this very version, which means only the steam version is being up-dated and worked on. meaning the boxed version os out-of date. The steam version is still just as customizable as the boxed, and housed in your steamapps folder just as it is in your program folder. so installing extra add-ons is not an issue, as they have not touced that side, and if they did, well i woud not have bought it. There are unfortunatly some add-ons that currently do not work with FSE:SE, those i have found to be atm - Cargo Pilot - from just flight- Active Sky Next But i have herd that ALL A2A planes work 100%, now this is a good point, because if your in the business of getting add-on aircraft. then A2A is the way to go. the attention to detail, the flight physics, the realism, it is all mind blowing. This is going to breath new life into an old but epic simulator. @£19,99 (when not on sale) i think that is a more than fair price, being as this is the FULL version of FSX with acceleration. What more could you ask for, Buy it, download it, Sim it. See you in the skies.			"

												Took adavantage of the FSX Steam Edition reduced price in March and installed it. I have been playing FS since it was first introduced in the 1980s and have become addicted. Very disappointed when Microsoft decided to pull out of FS development a few years ago. Clearly the box version was not going to keep up with the advances in operating systems over time and I was seeing the box FSX sim crash on a regular basis, even on a very highly configured box. Played with X-Plane for a while but not the same. I was sceptical about how much better the Steam Edition would be over the box version but the price reduction was a good incentive. All I can say is WOW!!! The Steam Edition is superior to the box version in many ways, not the least of which is Windows 10 compatability with not a single OS crash even though all settings are at maximum. Graphics are better and performance is much better. Very pleased I moved to FSX SE and I am now back in the cockpit.			"

												I do and dont' recommend this game. This is not a game i would recommend to everyone, only weirdos like me. The missions are long and boring, you dont' fight things, you litterally just fly airplanes. But thats okay, because it's relaxing. So if you are interested in this game, keep in mind:It's a simulator so expect the only thing you do to fly This game is better if you have a HOTASFlying takes time, don't expect to get anywhere fastThe missions are simple tasks that don't require to much thought and take up to a maximum of 3 hours to complete, so to normal people it should be boring.But other than those i would recommend it to anybody that has a interest in flight simulators because it is the BEST flight sim i've ever played. It will consume your life because there are so many diffrent planes, and missions, and areas to fly, and you can download more planes, and missions, and areas to play. It's endless fun.9/10 would not recommend to normal people.  "

												FSX is a game I have played for 6 months and still struggle with. The game provides a very realistic look into the large capacity of solutions Pilots must conjure on a day to day basis with difficult challenges such as different weather conditions and the size of airport you choose to find yourself in. I would highly recommend buying a controller to use while playing the game at the least as I soon found the difficulties of flying with just a keyboard which increases the difficulty rating by about 10. Dont expect a GTA style flying conditions as members of the online community take the game very seriously in their approach which is in its own respect is a good thing for learners and experts of the game alike. This game will take a while to master but is well worth the purchase for a long gaming experience.			"

												Flew a GPS led navigation for a fairly short flight from Heathrow (EGLL) to Malaga (LEMG).Whole flight goes off without a hitch. GPS points were plotted in, so I got in on course and just observed the route for most of the flight. Begiin my descent to Malaga, still fine, all the way through my descent towards to APP glideslope.As I go to hook the glideslope, I take control back to my yoke, deciding to fly it in manually.Extend the flaps, disengage the FD and AP Master... Game crash.Great flight sim. But don't get too heavily invested in to your flights, as the game can straight up crash with no warning.			"

												FSX from 2006, optimized by dovetail, is still the most viable option if you want to get into flight simming. Not only that, it is also the still the best game (price wise) if you are into general aviation planes.It has it all, from communication with ATC to many many airfields in the world.  You can find many good addons for it. From free to paid. It has learning tools (allthough I used youtube video's from ""doofer911"" to learn how to fly and navigate) . So instead of just giving you the flight mechanics, like Xplane does, it's a complete package.This game is very dated, so  out of the box it obviously looks like crap. You can make it look bearable or very realistic. But making it look very realistic will cost you a lot. We are talking hundreds of dollars here.  I did not do that (yet). I went for some  cheap paid stuff, and free mods, and made it bearable :PWhen I compare this to xplane: Xplane11 looks amazing, the physics are better (according to the reviews). It is far more expensive, but it's not a complete package. Plus you need a very powerfull PC.IMO FSX is still the best choice if you want to start flightsimming or are into General Aviation planes. The best GA planes you can find are from A2A Simulations, and those high quality GA planes are simply not available for xplane. FSX has good working ATC communications. It is a lot cheaper, needs less powerfull machine, and has some nice addons like  ""airhauler"", to give purpose to flying.So unless you are a seasoned flight simmer that prefers to fly the big birds, FSX is still the best game and best option if you want to start flight simming.

												It's about time I gave my opinion on FSX:SE.I never owned the boxed edition of FSX, however, I had a friend of mine who did, and he reccomended that I get FSX. I got it about a year ago when it was on sale for $5.00. When my friend found out, he was as excited as I was.Simply put, it was the best $5 I ever spent. I love FSX:SE. As this was my first full fledge flight simulator, I didn't need all the bells and whistles of newer flight sims such as X-Plane. I just enjoyed flying planes. I really learned a lot playing this game, as it taught me the basics of aircraft flight. I started off on small Cessnas and Pipers but gradually worked my way up to larger Boeings. The default aircraft are good but not perfect. If you are just beginning, you won't be able to tell the difference, but if you are an experienced flight simmer/actual pilot, you will see some things missing. However, if you get bored with the default aircraft, you can always download more planes for free at simviation.com.The multiplayer is very fun. The Steam multiplayer works well and I enjoy flying formations and airline hops with other players online. As a member of the FSX Competition Center, I can participate in landing competitions online. However, I do have a few complaints about multiplayer. The first is that the microphone communication is TERRIBLE - it's almost impossible to make out anything anyone says. It is for this reason that most servers use TeamSpeak to communicate. I personally prefer using the chat box. My other issue is that you can't use the direct connect feature - which prevents FSX:SE from playing online multiplayer with FSX Boxed. This was something dissapointing I found out when I tried playing with my friend - luckily, he recently purchased FSX:SE himself, so now we can do multiplayer! My last problem isn't with the multiplayer itself, but with the people. Many people on the SE multiplayer are less experienced than people who played the boxed edition. So if you want the most realistic ATC multiplayer possible, you may want to get VATSIM (which works great with FSX:SE BTW).The graphics are nothing special, considering this game is over 10 years old. But I can ignore poor graphics if the gameplay is good, which the gameplay in FSX is OUTSTANDINGLY FUN!!! However, if you want improved graphics, they have addons for that.The most notable thing about FSX:SE is how WELL it runs on my PC. My laptop is far from a gaming powerhouse, and it even struggles to run some of the most basic games at times. However, at times, I am getting maximum framerates on FSX:SE at high settings! FSX:SE is the most playable game on my PC by far, so if your PC is weak, don't worry, it will likely handle FSX:SE fine. Also, I'm running Windows 7.In the end, FSX:SE is a great flight simulator. It has excited me for hours and taught me a lot about aviation in the process. It may have even inspired me to eventually get a real pilot's liscence! If you are a beginner or expert in flight simming, and you want an excellent flight simulator that will grow with you, then FSX:SE is the game for you. I give it a 9.5/10.Tip: Be sure to pick up the game when it is on sale, as the price sometimes drops as low as $5.00!			"

												Bringing the FSX world to Steam, making the game playable for Windows 10 made it so I could finally upgrade from Windows 7. It has kept the same level of realism and compatibility with most after market add ons. I have not had any problems adding Blue Sky Scenery with helps the ground realism (in select areas) greatly, while also adding many vintage warbirds for truly exciting flying.The added attraction of the multiplayer capability makes an interesting new dimension to flight, where you have to avoid other fliers that may maneuver irregularly. The only drawback to the multiplayer realm is that you get an interpreted display of other's aircraft unless you have the exact same plane installed, with precisely the same name on your system. With there being literally tens of thousands of add-on aircraft and helicopters out there it makes it a guarantee that many, perhaps MOST, will be flying something entirely other than what you see. If there was some way to have the game transmit the appearance of the plane you are flying so others see you as you are, this would add a level of realism that would have me in multiplayer every time I fly.I truly enjoy the level of realism FSX has over older versions of Flight Simulator. I've been flying various versions for 27 years and having it available in Windows 10 means that I will still have many more years to enjoy this simulation.			"

												This game is very fun and rewarding, given that the player takes the time to understand how aircrafts work, the controls, and how to navigate. This game has been around for a very long time, so I'm not going to try and reinvent the wheel by posting a full review. I just want to say that this game is at the top of my list of greatest games of all time, despite all the annoying bugs that somehow haven't been fixed yet. I hope that Dovetail offers more updates to fix these issues and continued customer support.			"

												Good flight sim. However the default aircraft are not the best (you can't push every button and cockpit may not look like the real plane PMDG aircraft), just note that you have to pay for a good 747, a better 737-800, a 777, and 757 etc.  (Like PMDG aircraft, quality wings, and captain sim aircraft). PMDG, quality wings, and captain sim aircrafts are the only addons I personally would recommend (and to those who want more and better aircraft). Other addons in the steam store are not the best. Graphics wise, they are not the best but its the simulation of a captains role that counts, however bad graphics can ruin the experience, so if u would want better graphics, the REX 4 Texture Direct addon would be the best for runways, weather, taxiways, etc. Better ground/mesh textures that's FTX global's job. If you want more realistic airports... well those are addons too, such as flytampa addons and FSdream team addons (they're usually worth it) and if you want to take your simulation to the next level with live ATC and where YOU give readbacks and request things from the ATC, get VATSIM. It's free, proffensional, however the rules are very VERY strict. Other than that all the sim needs when you first get it, is better aircraft(s), good texture addon(s), and VATSIM.			"

												Pros:-The game has a sandbox feel.-Online play is active like it used to be.-Many of the add on from FSX still work.-The flying models all seem nice and it is fun to navigate them.-You can explore the whole world.-Navigation is easy once you know how to use it.-The flight planner is good, but I am still learning it.-Dovetail is pretty responsive on fixing issues with the game.Cons-A few of the add ons do not work. (Carrier Strike Force cannot launch 3wirex due to an issue on permissions on the application).-The F/A-18 Hornet navigation systems did not work online, but I think that I found a way around it. (go to view>instruments>GPS)-The voice nmultiplayer option is not the best because it doesn't come across clear. It makes me wonder if it is a netcode issue or a lack of VOIP support.-The software will not allow me to go above 16khz, so this might have something to do with my voice issues.Conclusion:I think if you haven't played FSX and you have always wanted to this is a great option if you have Windows 8 or higher.  This has plenty of add ons avaliable online to make you want to try it again if you are a seasoned FSX pilot, but with that being said this can be an expensive hobby given enough time. I would personally recommend it.			"

												It's great to see this franchise resurrected! I have been playing Flight Simulator since the days of FS98. FSX was a true masterpiece as others have commented and I was very sad to see the franchise get axed by Microsoft. Thankfully, Dovetail has released the classic game on Steam. Through some under-the-hood tweaks, it plays better than the boxed version of FSX that Microsoft released!The performance increase alone makes this a worthwhile purchase. It is also worth the money to not have to safeguard your old FSX discs and serial since you can always re-download on Steam.I would highly recommend and encourage people to support this effort and game. We need some life breathed back into the flight simming world!			"

It also comes with a TON of literature about flying, so you can really get into the whys and wherefors of the simulation (hint: learn to trim so you don't have to keep a deathgrip on your stick). The playthrough tutorials are good but the flight lessons have long, entertaining essays that will really hone your skills. Sadly, the in-game scripts for the flight lessons are not included as of this writing. Still, for someone on a budget with an older machine, this is about as good as it gets.			"

												Crash-happy. Can't get more than ten minutes into a flight before the game hangs and crashes. No mods, minimal graphics, same thing. FSX was one of my favorite games, but the Steam re-release desperately needs debugging.			"

												I have always wanted this game. Steam made that a reality. I have to say, even with its shortcommings due to age (the occasinal dll runtime crash,weird resolutions, glitchy load ins and other annoying bugs) the game runs at about 95% perfect. It is SO much fun to play. I dusted off a Saitek Cyborg joystick for this one and it works great. The xbox 360 controller works pretty good, but you will want to remap. I truly enjoy this. I picked it up for $5 and I could say I would pay up to $10 MAYBE 15 and it be worth it considering it does have issues, but I would wait until it is on sale before buying IMHO. $24.99 just seems a bit steep for this. I have only dabbled into the multiplayer a few times and I really like it. The missions are great and of course free flight is the best. I love flying. This is a solid 9/10 with one point knocked off for some glitches and crashes. Otherwise have at it! If you want to learn how to fly, buy it!			"

												A versão Steam deste jogo era um sonho para muito amantes da simulação como eu. Eu estava empolgado com o lançamento.. mas infelizmente nada especial aconteceu deste a data que foi lançado, o Directx ainda está buggado, além de que, agora o jogo está travadando muito, com vários problemas de compatibilidades. A Dovetail está somente pensando em $$$, em fazer mais dinheiro vendendo alguns addons estúpidos. English:Steam version of this game was just a dream for many simmers like me. I was really excited with that release... but unfortunately nothing special happened since the release date, the Directx 10 is still buggy, in addition, now the game is crashing a lot, with many compatibilities issues. Dovetail is only aiming $$$, in making more money selling some stupid addons!			"

												This is Microsoft's premier flight simulator product. It provides all the features you'd expect from a flight simulator. However, they have taken the approach that only the most basic planes and functionality are included. High resolution images, high res weather, more detailed planes, additional planes, better flight management tools, etc. are all additional purchases. I purchased the high resolution packs and more detailed planes, but unfortunately found out that all of the cockpit buttons, dials and so on still aren't usable. I wanted something where I can use the real buttons on the cockpit panels instead of keyboard shortcuts for everything. Overall though it's not bad. It does what it's supposed to do and the built-in tutorials are great.			"

The most of the things in the cockpit are workingA lot of free sceenery and aircrafts.There are a lot of payware addons.Cons:Graphics are bad but the game is old so that is not really a big problem.There are a lot of payware addons that are really expencive but you can play the game without them.

												I have the original game on my shelf, decided to buy this so I could fly multiplayer again. It was very disappointing to find out that there are only a handful of multiplayer scenarios, mostly racing crap. Maybe I don't get how to use a drop-down menu or I'm missing the secret information how to get the other multiplayer modes to work. If this had workshop support I could recommend this game, but it seems they want limitations to the release so they can charge more for things as time goes by.Also  there hasn't been one update posted on here since I purchase it, not a bug-fix or note about what they are working on... just DLC $$$... Not what I want to see.			"

												First, I must say that I play this game exclusively with a very nice joystick and throttle combo, so my experience is going to be different from someone without a joystick.That said, this is a very well made game with a bazillion airports and well made maps (I could recognize a lot of landforms around where I live).  The selection of planes is very good, most heavily focusing on commercial planes, from small single-props to the all-mighty 747.  The missions make for great structured gameplay, and you do not have to follow all the instructions, just complete the overall objective (finish the race, land the plane, go here, go there, etc.).  Also, the map in-game covers the entire world, so you can chart a flight from Laguardia in New York and actually fly to Heathrow  in England or LAX in California.  Just make sure that your plane has enough fuel so you aren't ditching in some mountain range or in the middle of the ocean.This game is not for the faint of heart, as it is an excellent simulator, but there is most certainly a lot of fun to be had.

												This game came out in 2006 back when I was a wee fetus, being already heavily into FS2002 and FS2004 I got this game for christmas when it came out and have been in love ever since. Now that I have a computer I can max every slider, have REX installed and payware aircraft; is just a dream come true. Although it is old, it plays like it came out yesterday, if you ignore the whole 32-bit thing... X-Plane 11 is around the corner however, but it doesn't have the addons.TLDR: I'm a flight sim nerd, if you are too you probably already have this. If you're not a flight sim enthusiast, it can be a little daunting, but so is piloting a real aircraft. This isn't just a game.			"

												I've been playing FSX since it came out in 2006 [Best. Christmas. Gift. Ever.]When I found out it was on Steam, I immediately bought it [my CD version got a little wonky :(] +700 Hours between CD and Steam version. And ever since I first played it, I grew a love for flying. While the game has it's up's and downs I do highly reccomend it for those looking for an introduction to flying or those wanting to continue that hobby.+You have a great variety of default planes to choose from, from the 737, to the classic Cessna Skyhawk, even something like the Piper Cub+Game is easy to mod+Plenty of add ons planes online, both free and paid+/- Haven't tried Multiplayer Yet+Hosts a large number of airports to fly through throughout the world including small airstrips you think would not be there+Includes the Acceleration Pack so you have the famous F-18, P-51, and EH101 Heli+Nice Scenery [if you have your setting up]+Very flexible settings for low end and high end PC's+Features an AI system where you can fly with AI planes, features setting to change frequency of traffic+Has an ATC Radio System you can use in flight+Multiplayer has the ability to play ATC instead of pilot [Haven't played that though]-Cockpits aren't necessarily professional or realistic [There are realism settings but those looking for more professional cockpits that you have to program preflight, look for payware planes by CaptainSim, Aerosoft, or Wilco Publishing]-P-51 for some reason is unbalanced in fuel, Plane leans to the left in flight-All the addons on Steam do not have dynamic missions but premade flights.-There are some scenery glitches such as airstrips sitting in large holes or sitting on plateaus suspended in air [wtf?]All in all, I give the game a 9/10. While it has it's errors, it's the best you'll find anywhere. Open for modifications, flexible settings, good gameplay [a whole lot better than X-Plane in my opinion]. Still one of the best PC games I will ever play [+1 for good memories]			"

												I had flown MSFSX for a long time but the constant crashing made me give up. The steem version dosn't seem to have that problem. 4 Hrs so far and no crash. I'm talking about game crashes not plane crashes. I runs very smooth on my system but I haven't turned some things up yet. I was actually thinking about reloading the old game when I saw that they hade just released it on steem. Affter reading some reviews decided to get it on steam. So far I'm very glad I did.Just discovered after 14 Hrs of play that they still have a problem with the Pilot Log getting corrupted. It will cause the game to open to the splash screen then freeze. You then have to delite the Pilot Log Bin file to start the game. Was hopeing they had fixed this but no luck.Ok, so now after 18 Hrs play it locks up after I landed at an airport. Looks like they haven't fixed it after all. Seems to be still to glitchy to depend on. I try to run a continuas saved game and I don't want to have to start over after a half hour of play. I can't give it a recomindation untill I can start depending on it not to freeze up on me.			"

												Microsoft Flight Simulator X was abandoned by Microsoft about 9 years ago. Dovetail Games was given the license to redistribute it, though. This means FSX is a ten year old game that hasn't been updated in almost a decade. It still manages to stay alive by people who just want to mess around. Compared to todays technology, this is a bad simulator. The physics are rubbish, the planes are unrealistic, and the scenery is awful. The thing that keeps it alive is the 3rd party support. There are SO many addons to this game. I have played this game for 200+ hours (including offline time), and I know in order to make this game good, you have to spend hundreds of dollars on addons and equipment. For example, t isn't really worth it to spend $90 on good physics and wind patterns, when they are already in X-Plane or P3D. P3D should actually replace this, for it copied FSX, since Microsoft abandoned it, and started making new updates with DX11 support! Dovetail is just trying to trick people into buying a game not updated in 10 years, to make a bunch of money. Overall, the community is great, and you can make this better than X-Plane if you spend a bunch of money like I did, but for the base game, I cannot recomment this. Get X-Plane or P3D. 3/10			"

For now, the Steam Edition dlcs are a sad 3, so you should look at external websites to find the good stuff. Google something like ""best add ons for FSX"", a ton of good content out there. If your getting addons that were designed for non-Steam Editions, make sure you install Simconnect in \Steam\steamapps\common\FSX\SDK\Core Utilities Kit\SimConnect SDK\LegacyInterfaces\FSX-XPACK and it should work. Do additional research if you're still unsure if they'll work with the SE version.			"

												I already love this game. When I first bought FSX, I thought the technology of the plane would be too complicated for me, and that I wouldn't be able to enjoy the game due to me not having the throttle. I was wrong. While you do have lots of tech at your disposal (Especially in larger planes like the 747), most of the tech is optional. After watching a quick Youtube tutorial, I was already a pro! On my first take off(In Moscow), I crashed several times (but I had fun). Then I tried doing an actual flight, from Montreal (YUL), to Ottawa on a smaller plane (I tried with a 737, I failed), I enjoyed the beautiful and realistic views during the flight, I failed the landing. To this day, I still fail at landing. I remember doing a longer flight, going from Shanghai (Pudong) to the Japanese coast in a fighter jet, that is the farthest flight I have ever done. I love the game, I enjoy doing flights, seeing the beautiful and realistic views. This game is perfect for people that love exploring the world, the game is also good for people that like simulation games and people interested in aviation. I would recommend this game to any patient gamer. I give Microsoft Flight Simulator X an 8/10 realistic and very fun-Zawx			"

I wish the menu's were smoother and easier to navigate but I think its well worth the 80% off I got it for.Microsoft flight simulator x had its initial release in 2006, for a game made in 2006 its an amazing simulator! Back when this game was on steam before it got taken off it was the best flight simulator. Now you can probably get better flight simulators in 2014 but its really up to personal opinion.Pros-Very good tutorial missions.Great controlsGood with Joy stick/ game padHuge world (Could have better buildings and trees)Cons-FPS drops randomly and never hits over 60. (Graphics card: GTX 780)Some buildings arent rendered so you can just go straight through them and even land inside them.You can get better simulators now in 2014			"

												Hi I'm Ken Gardner and I've been flying my computer since FS95, in other words I've been around the block a while. I started playing FSX-SE on my desktop just after it was introduced and found it worked pretty good not like the highly modified FSX stand-a-lone I have. The main problem was no FSUIPC for my addons, Pete Dowson fixed that and now 90% of my addons work. Dovetail did the rest with their updates. Now I Fly both versions FSX stand-a-lone on the desktop and FSX-SE on my laptop. Anybody can see what I'm flying anytime I'm online it's usally an aircraft I've modified to fly as realistic as I think it should. It looks like Dovetail has taken FSX to another level.  I for one am very happy and pass along my recomendation for others to get with it and enjoy flying in the skys of simulation.			"

												I'm a lover of simulators, and a long time customer of Microsoft's Flight Simulator series, all the way back from 98 to FSX. FSX was a great game back in 2006, but this new release makes a great oldie even better. Yes, they couldn't really update the graphics engine, and yes the framework is still 8 years old, but it works and works well. Steam integration makes it seamless to launch. Bugs have been fixed and the game is a MUCH better experience. And biggest of all, ALL MY FAVORITE FREEWARE MODS STILL WORK. Yes, the file structure is EXACTLY the same as FSX used to be. Everything still works. Mods from 2007 dropped in seamlessly. So don't be worried. If you loved this game before, you'll still love it here. I HIGHLY recommend this game.			"

												Best Game Ever! I have been plating this game from long time ago (the boxed version) switched to SE and its really fun playing, there are lots of missions if you are interested in. Default planes are made for begginers to get them started or you can get in big boy stuff like get planes from PMDG or aerosoft and many more, lots of great develepor for great sceneries. Great sim if you love flying however it can cost a lot of money to make your sim really realistic and you definately need a powerful pc to run addon planes and sceneries, Intel and Nvidia recommended!

												Review/How I made the game a good experinceFlight Simulator X, for the price is a truly amazing simulator. When you account for its true age (10/2006) it makes it even more astonishing. While only being on steam for a short while most of the modding community have embraced it although I will go into detail with this later.The unmodified experience is great, until you start getting into it more. For my first 100-120 hours I was playing with just the base game planes and free online mods and it was plenty of fun. But once you decide to really get into it, say hello to montly subscriptions, goodbye to $500+ in addons and much more!Here is my summary though.Air Traffic Control:The Air Traffic Control in hine sight is terrible but I never knew at the time not with only being new to the community, now I am a member of Vatsim and a paying customer of PilotEdge to get online ATC which greatly improves your experience.Planes:After that is sorted you get into the issue of planes. If you are happy with the stock planes, I urge you to continue using them because once you decide to expand on your library and get premium planes you struggle to go back to the limited ones. When purchasing planes also dont go crazy on your first purchase, and buy adverage planes. My first payware plane was the Just Flight Boeing 737-200Adv. and it is alright but as I continued to advance I discovered the wonderful world of PMDG. They are from my understanding the best addon company for planes on the market. I started off with their flagship, the 777-200LR/F package, a truly fantastic plane and then advanced to purchase the BAe 41 Jetstream which is where I run into my first truly major con of Steam Edtion. I learnt the hard way that not every mod is compatable with Steam Edition, and I can not urge you enough to ensure that any mod you purchase clearly states that it is supported because spending $50 on a unsupported mod does not make you happy (There are work arounds but it is not perfect). I am now wanting to add few more planes to my fleet then will be happy with that department.Scenary:I am yet to purchase scenary mods because I personally like to fly all over the world so purchasing scenary is just not going to work for me yet. But the option is there and the built in stuff is terrible but changing it costs a lot. If you fly in one area and VFR a lot then I couldnt recommend anything better.Gameplay Mods:The final polish in my opinion is mods like GSX (Ground Services), FS2Crew (Co-Pilot/Voice control), FSIPanel (Training) and many others that just add so much to the overall experince. GSX was the first thing I added to my collection because it makes all the time you spend on the ground a little bit more fun and the I got FS2Crew with my 777 which makes the games fantastic. FSIPanel is new to my collection and I am still to really play around with it but it will help make me a much better pilot. I also have mods like FSPassengers which add a goal to the game, to run an airline but that didn't appeal to me much. It will make some people enjoy it a lot more though. These either mean a lot to you or just about nothing, but to me these are probably the most important.Conclusion:I get asked a lot how do you have so many hours in that game. I reply I dont know :P At first look it looks boring but once you really get into it and put the time into planning out what you are going to do, roleplay and do it it is really damn fun. It has cost me a lot to get it to where i have it and it was not easy, trail and error like anything I guess.This game is not for everyone but I can not suggest it more to anyone that is really into planes.

Posted: April 22, 2016
												So I'm an avid FSX user since its launch in 2006. I've clocked over 1000 hours in the game, half on Vatsim/Multiplayer, other half offline. The game was tremendously helpful in my pursuit of my private pilot's license. I've been wanting a modernized flight simulator that runs on a modern OS since Windows 8 came out. I've heard of Prepar3d but I do not like its EULA policy even though I'm an undergraduate student and I'm qualified for its academic license. The interface and software for Lockheed's variant is tailored for flight training institutions and for professional environments and it's not very user friendly for the home user. I thought about converting to X-Plane but couldn't commit because I already have so many add-ons for FSX. Fast forward to 2014 and Windows 10, FSX was released on Steam (which by the way I couldn't believe, but very happy) from Dovetail and after downloading and installing the game, it was compatible 100% with Windows 10, no tweaking needed. Not only that but Dovetail made several improvements to the game even after Microsoft released Service Pack 2/Acceleration for FSX in 2007, a big one being adding their own multiplayer since GameSpy servers were shut down, major optimization for framerate issues and so on. PMDG and 90% of my addons work well with the Steam Edition and the other 10% have updates that make it compatible as well. Overall it’s a good competition to other Flight Simulators already out there and I can’t wait until Dovetail announces their new plans for 2016.			"

												I was first introduced to Microsoft Flight Simulator with FS95. Seeing FSX released on the Steam platform by Dovetail Games brings great joy to my heart. Hopefully now we will see the updates that FSX so rightly deserved before Microsoft doomed it to die an extremely slow death by shutting down Ace Studios.Speaking of updates, the Steam version of FSX has already received many optimizations that makes it run OUTSTANDING on modern hardware. The multiplayer has also been revived and it seems to work well.Please give these guys your support and BUY THIS NOW. If you are an avid flight simmer and/or have owned previous versions of MSFS including the boxed copy of FSX you will not be dissapointed. Once Steam Workshop support is added this should quickly become a wet dream for many of us.			"

												It is what it is, a flight simulator. Tried a helicopter and was less than impressed with the fact you don't have to fire it up like a real helicopter, I haven't flown a real helicopter, but there are startup procedures on a simulator I played where you had to turn on the battery, turn on the gas turbine engine, then ignite, then up the throttle, but there was none of that, the graphics may have been alright for the time, but they're awful now, not sure if I'll ever try this again.

												This game would be great....if you could play it..... I can't speak highly enough of my first 10 hours. Same experience as the other versions of FS, and great updates to graphics since the last iteration. I have been playing Flight Simulator all of my life and have owned every version, and this version is easilly the best. Unfortunately its UNPLAYABLE. Spend hours learning to fly. Spend hours learning to Nav. Spend hours figuring out ILS. Now your ready right? 20-40 hours sunk into it and you are ready for your first airport to airport. Make sure to pick two that are 20 minutes apart in real time, because anything longer will CRASH THE GAME. Seriously. There is a huge bug in Terrain.dll and it will crash the game WITHOUT FAIL on EVERY flight over a certain length/distance. Gone is any chance to fly from London to Hong Kong or Sydney to LA. Oh, and if you turn on time compression, watch out! It makes it worse!So, if you like short flights of 20 minutes or less, to look at terrain not modeled with any accuracy (because Google maps is hard) and then a nice CTD, by all means, pick up this title. Otherwise avoid as unplayabale as the game has a FUNDAMENTAL FLAW that will NEVER be patched. The community answer is to 1) Turn down settings until the game looks horrible 2) fly short distances 3) do not use time compression. Sure. Again, do not buy this game. Terrain.dll crash. Google it.			"

												Well first i have to say: I dont get all that people complaining that the steam edition doesnt work better than the boxed one. I had a lot of games before they came to steam and i never thought about that they should run better here.And if you need the sdk to develop new things (yay its so easy anyone can do this *sarcasm* get the boxed version with sdk for 10 bucks - thats just something completely irrelevant for a normal guy who just wants to play).Personally im happy that this simulation was introduced here. It was at 5$ the time i bought it and i thought ""lets give it a try"". And i love it so far. Just be warned that you have to spend ALOT of additional money to improve it (aircraft,atc,fscaptain,scenery.landclass.. it goes on and on).Only negative thing for me is that this game really isnt made for triplescreen setups which im used to.Borderless windowmode on mainscreen i usually get the wanted 30+ fps with orbx,rex4,softclouds, weather engine and so on. And in the end it isnt that bad to undock panels and move them to other screens / watch your flight in a flightplanner.. whatever...Is it compatible with every addon released ... NODoes that bother me?... hell NOYou can easily check the forums or other sites to see what is working. And most of the important stuff works.Like in every other simulator you sometimes have to find workarounds... edit config files... but if you are into that kind of games you should be used to it.At least for me this game works perfect. no crashes so far. everything is running smooth after finetuning things.Just remember its a simulator. And like in every good simulator i played (like omsi, iracing...) you gotta invest some time and search the internet to get the best out of it.			"

												This game is so good, i have played more then 1000 hours on the boxed version and the game is still great.Not only does FSX support more then 10.000 mods (skins, completely new planes, scenerys, instruments) it has every single airport you can possibly imagine on here, you want to take off from that small grass strip 10km away from your house? sure its possible.The game also has a speed up button if you don't want to fly for a long time it also has fuel so if you're flying in a small plane from Europe to the US you won't make it over the ocean if you don't fill up your fuel tank.Before you land and when you take off its the best to start with talking to the Air Traffic Controll because you don't want to crash into someone else.Overall its a great game but ofcourse there are somethings to consider:The FPS is low, always have been its a heavy CPU gameThere a whole lot of nothing.. you take off you fly for ~1/2hours and you land.The scenery is not that beautyfull although the planes look fantastic.It crashes sometimes when Alt Tabbing.And as final, a Joystick is recommended it does support Mouse Yoke which aint that bad.Overall it's a great game for someone who wants to taste the life of a pilot!

												Got a few hours under my wings now so i feel i can give a good view on this sim,On a whole this sim will give any consumer base sim a run for its money and has been the staple flight sim for years and hopefully years to come Pros :- The base sim has all you need to take to the skies and learn to fly a good selection of aircraft something for all tastes be it a single prop cessna to four engine 747 airliner, loads of DLC content to purchase though steam from aircraft to airports.Cons:- The sim looks a bit dated (Remember its a 10 year old software and this can be fixed with 3rd party software and texture packs), DLC's can be a bit expensive but sales are always going on on steam so these are a good chance to pick up a good deal.

												Overall: 8/10Ok, I've loved the Microsoft Flight Simulator franchise since the early 90's. I've played tons of flight simulators and none of them come close to FSX. The real time weather is fantasticly accurate and when played on the highest realism settings the aircraft behaves as one would in said weather. The pockets of turbulence above a rise, the shift in heading from a headwind. It's very, very accurate. I find flying on here is probably one of the most relaxing things my PC has to offer me. GET A JOYSTICK.Pros: 8/101. The landscape is decent. It looks dated. But that's because it is. The size relationships between the aircraft and the buildings is a bit off but it works.2. Very realistic both in aircraft interior/exterior apperance and in flight dynamics.3. Missions are fun (I tend to re-run them for better metrics like time when I'm bored).4. The handbook and lessons are helpful.5. When used properly the ATC radio communications are very realistic.Cons: 7/10 (points subtracted for cons)1.  Not a lot of choices for aircraft. Would like to see more jets/jumbojets/helicopters etc.2. Multiplayer VOIP is broken. Period. It doesn't work right. Maybe ONCE in a blue moon you'll come across a server with a working VOIP system, but that it superbly rare.3. The airports are... disappointing. Microsoft claims they're accurate representations of the airports. But they're not. They're really not. They're close enough that you can ignore it, but don't make a claim about being ""accurate representations"" of something if it's really not. And no it's not because it's been a lot of time since the game was released. RDU International Airport never looked that way.Replay Value: 10/10I've been playing this particular game for 10 years now. Enough said.			"

												Again Dovetail loves to throw a ton of DLC that's really expensive but this gets a pass because most of these planes you can download and mod with a little magic from the internet, I've logged thousands of hours in flight simulators and I had this on the disk before the disk installation was corrupted sadly. alsoDovetail! stop throwing us DLC that's full of bugs that breaks the game and is ridiculously expensive! $25 for a plane is ridiculous. Not as bad as a $40 locomotive in train simulator but its still really steep!			"

												It's a good simulator, a tad dated but there is essentially infinite content to create a better world. Default is fun, interesting, and you can see parts of the world - however it's not entirely realistic. Some of the larger cities have more details but if you make a lot of road trips or spend out time in the country you'll quickly realize that there's not a lot of realism near ground level. I prefer to fly low following roads, rivers, streams, canyons and it always amazes me when I see a house in the middle of an interstate or houses lining runways at smaller airports next to terminal buildings and hangars. I'm not complaining too much because the game is dated but the fact that it's still in use by so many and new content is always appearing shows that there is a lot of love for this sim. You will probably spend days or weeks searching through free content and you could easily spend hundreds or thousands of dollars for paid content. Personally, I don't want to spend too much to make it better I would rather wait for a newer sim with better/modern coding and better graphics out-of-the-box. I think Dovetail is going to be delivering something soon or perhaps I would look into P3D or X-plane. This is still a great sim though and is usually on sale throughout the year for a low price. If you fly high or do standard traffic routes you may not care about the up-close ground level details, but if you prefer to fly under 500ft you're going to notice a lot of goofs and glitches with the world. There are mods and DLC packs that can correct and modernize and make things more realistic, but again it's going to take or money or both and the game is around ten years old or so. I love the amount of content though, sadly a lot of the freeware aircraft out there are still optimized only for DX9 and I don't like having to turn my graphics down to enjoy games or simulators so I've wasted many hours, probably days or maybe even a week or two downloading and trying to use aircraft only to delete them after being forced to cut my graphics and performance backwards. I recommend it, it's great for beginners or advanced flight sim fans but just like any other simulator or hobby it can become quite pricey depending on what you want to fly, where you want to go, what you want to see, and how much detail and realism you want to experience. There are plenty of stores that offer content and they have plenty of sales throughout the year as well. Be warned though, more realism you want the more you will spend - but even going baseline or buying one of the packages on a Steam sale you'll get plenty hours of this. After-all there have been sim pilots flying this for over ten years...Even taking the age into account I would give it 7 or 8 out of ten, fly high and it looks good enough, fly low and you'll need to make it look better. I'm not talking about 4k textures or over-detailed roads or anything but I tried following a couple familiar interstates and highways and found very little realism - even some smaller cities and towns the layout just appears completely randomized. I found a spot on I10 where the interstate twisted around a random house - I've seen HP cars sitting in the medians before but never houses. So take that how you will, good simulator, good out of the box, great with pricey add-ons like ORBX. *You can get a lot of free trial-ware add-ons for scenery but most of the trial aircraft are so limited it's not worth it. Yay I can throttle up and throttle down and look at it in chase plane but can't lift off or turn! If you go with add-ons I would suggest flying a specific path in stock version, load the add-on - I love the Pacific Northwest trial from ORBX - fly the exact same path to see the new level of detail. Stock version you may see power line towers, with a good add-on package you can actually follow the power lines visually, or follow actual roads. I have not tried any of the ""Photo-real"" packages though but I'm tempted - however P3D and X-plane are also trying to tempt me these days. 64bit optimized versus adding onto 32bit...FSX is good though, just make sure you have plenty of hard drive space and some extra spending money to make it better for you.

												The learning curve is steep. You have to love civil aviation to enjoy this. Flight simulation is a unique experience and this game is the benchmark of the business.I use this game to fly online on VATSIM with thousands of other people. Some handle the Air Traffic Control while others just fly. It's a fantastic experience, yet difficult and mentally demanding. Flight simulation is not for the casual gamer. "

												Got a few hours under my wings now so i feel i can give a good view on this sim,On a whole this sim will give any consumer base sim a run for its money and has been the staple flight sim for years and hopefully years to come Pros :- The base sim has all you need to take to the skies and learn to fly a good selection of aircraft something for all tastes be it a single prop cessna to four engine 747 airliner, loads of DLC content to purchase though steam from aircraft to airports.Cons:- The sim looks a bit dated (Remember its a 10 year old software and this can be fixed with 3rd party software and texture packs), DLC's can be a bit expensive but sales are always going on on steam so these are a good chance to pick up a good deal.

												Cannot make any changes within the fsx drop down menu without the program crashing. VERY annoying after hours of preparation for a flight is spent only to result in the program terminating. Something as simple as adjusting the engine sound level, for example, will cause the screen to turn completely black followed by FSX closing. Unable to make any normal in-game changes. Also, joystick and controller settings reset to default every single time the program is opened. These issues make it impossible to enjoy the program, personally. I am very impressed by the performance (frame rates) of the Steam edition, but as mentioned earlier, it is impossible to enjoy the positive characteristics of the game when it continuously crashes during normal operation.

												So, in my Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Gold Edition that I had on CD, I could barely run my game on Medium settings with a fresh install, so I thought I would buy the Steam Edition and I can honestly say, I feel like a kid in a candy shop. I immediately set all of my sliders to ultra high on the Steam Edition to see whether it had been improved or not, and oh my god, I am running on 80 frames with EVERYTHING on ULTRA HIGH. I am honestly impressed and can't believe it. What an amazing Christmas present this has been. To all the flight simmers out there, this MUST be in your Steam Library list, it is just amazing, and Multiplayer has made its return!10/10 would squeal over great frame rate again.			"

												I have been a simmer for twenty years. the issues with FS9 and FSX are simple.  Microsoft stopped further development of the base platforms, which failed to keep up  with the progress of the computers on which they run. The most recent problem for me has been compatability issues around windows 10. I have re installed a clean windows seven and started again. I have downloaded FSX Steam and bought the FSX Steam CD's ( I have always preferred to keep the disks, there's something comforting about not having to rely on the  downloads).  I am writing simply to say that Dovetail / Steam has done a terrific job with the Flight Sim base programme which gives me better frame rates and an ability to re - install all that I have wanted to from my extensive library of add ons. I have learned that it can be a real challenge with some of the installs and finding your way into the FSX files has been a bit clumsy (so that I can install directly into the file instead of trying to run an install, which older add -ons can't navigate). But I honestly have recovered everything I want from my older add - ons. Very pleased, thank you. I am x- Brize Norton with a passion for the VC10. I will try and get some images out there for any other Brize geeks. Happy Simming Rob C.			"

What hasn’t really changed is Microsoft Flight Simulator. A lot of the elements, such as being a reasonably build product, hasn’t changed. MS Flight Simulator X is probably one of the last in a long line of flight simulators.Being on Sale for 75% off I thought I might as well pay for the Premium version, it was less than if I was to just pay for the base game without any discount. Some of the DLC content is really just gimmicks, such as Rex Texture 4, which just changes runway textures at a cost of $27.99.

Going back to having a powerful system, I thought that a GTX 980Ti would be more than capable of maxing out settings while still providing a very high frame rate. I was kind of wrong in that department, as the game still uses the old DirectX 9. MS Flight Simulator X still has a lot of shaders and what not in DirectX 9, and even states “2.0 Ghz or higher (single core)” as a minimum requirement. Performance isn’t as great as I had hoped. Sure there is a DirectX 10 “preview” option (whatever that means) in the graphics settings, but that doesn’t really help out. A lot of DirectX 10 cards were in customer’s PCs before MS Flight Simulator X was put on the market, it’s just a shame that we will never see an update to address this.

Besides performance, graphics, and overpriced DLC, the core mechanics are great. I was surprised how easy the game was to play with just a keyboard and mouse – I did find myself using the keyboard instead of the mouse most of the time to fly however. It has certainly been a while since I’ve played a proper flight simulator, but I was piloting jet aircraft in a short period of time. If you were to actually play the game seriously, I would recommend buying a joystick at some point.			"

												I have simmed with FSX boxed for a long time now, and I just recently made the switch to SE, and I must say, I really enjoy having multiplayer back without worrying about LAN servers. SE allows you to hop into a lobby of your choice, or even create your own session for simming with friends. Likes: MASSIVE MOD COMMUNITY! YOU WILL LOVE FINDING NEW AIRCRAFT TO DOWNLOAD AND FLY! 1000s of FREE AIRCRAFT AVAILABLE!Slightly optimized for new gen PCs & hardwareGreat multiplayer aspect revived via steam servers (versus obsolete Gamespy)Works with a ton of my joysticks, yokes, and even custom mapped switch panelsFun with friends: FSX is great alone, but if your looking into SE, you probably want to fly with other pilots around the world! This is the main reason I picked up SE and I am very happy.Cons:Some public servers are pretty chaotic & uncontrolled. If you want a true flight experience, you must VATSIM or host your own server and invite your friends. The public servers are still fun!OVERALL:If you are reading this, and you enjoy aviation, avionics, ATC, airports, or if you want to be a pilot some day, this is a MUST HAVE! FSX is to pilot enthusiasts as Nascar is to racing fans! :) TIP: DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE!! FSX GOES ON SALE PRETTY OFTEN; SCOOP IT DURING A SALE FOR >$10!!! "

												This version is just like the Boxed Version of FSX when it first came out in it's Gamespy days.The Steam version is not compatible (Multiplayerwise) with the FSX Boxed version which has been around for years which is a shame, as this would take flightsim Multiplayer back to the glory days.Because of this you will find lots of Noob players and may find it hard to find the simmers that take it a little more serious, but not too serious it is a game after all. ;)FSX in general is perfect for both the Professional Pilot and Air Traffic Controller if used correctly, whilst also being a game for those just starting out with an aviation interest.Aircraft can be setup to be easy to fly or configured to fly realisticly including startup procedures.Don't flick the switches in order and your plane won't start or Overspeed and you will stress your aircraft.There are lots of FSX groups about.Some can be very strict sticking to real life rules, Some groups can be a lot of fun with little to no rules and there are groups that combine the two providing a fun session whilst trying to stick the the real world rules.FSX is a must if your interested in aviation in anyway.

												This version is just like the Boxed Version of FSX when it first came out in it's Gamespy days.The Steam version is not compatible (Multiplayerwise) with the FSX Boxed version which has been around for years which is a shame, as this would take flightsim Multiplayer back to the glory days.Because of this you will find lots of Noob players and may find it hard to find the simmers that take it a little more serious, but not too serious it is a game after all. ;)FSX in general is perfect for both the Professional Pilot and Air Traffic Controller if used correctly, whilst also being a game for those just starting out with an aviation interest.Aircraft can be setup to be easy to fly or configured to fly realisticly including startup procedures.Don't flick the switches in order and your plane won't start or Overspeed and you will stress your aircraft.There are lots of FSX groups about.Some can be very strict sticking to real life rules, Some groups can be a lot of fun with little to no rules and there are groups that combine the two providing a fun session whilst trying to stick the the real world rules.FSX is a must if your interested in aviation in anyway.

												BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.I've been flight simming since the FS98 days and FSX is still the unoptomized pig that it was on initial release. Not to say that this isn't a good sim, but the hassle and frustration of going through individual files, tweaking values, and finding the one set of settings that works for your PC isn't worth the effort. And to give you an idea, I'm running an i7 3770k at 4.5ghz paird with a brand new GTX 970 and still get sub 30s with the graphics set to medium high. Get airbourn its not so bad, but the engine still chugs when you're close to the ground (usually on final appraoch, THE MOST IMPORTANT PHASE OF FLIGHT when you need smoothness the most).The FSX community is fantastic, and there are those who are more than willing to help you find those desired settings to get the game running as smoothly as possible. However, if you just want a sim that is easy to pick up and use, go back to FS9 or go to X-Plane 10. There's a reason why the Microsoft team fired everyone that made this game.			"

I highly recommend Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition. "

												This is a great price for the fully expanded version of this game and Simulation. Although the more critical among you know that the flight charicteristics are dumbed down, if you go to www.flightsim.com, and look up add ons one can find programs that make the flight physics fully realistic, and the same for weather, atc, etc... plus over 30,000 free aircraft and scenery add ons, and it all adds up to a terrific sim, but if your still critical, then steam does have X-PLANE 10, but it's a bit more $$$...

												This version has issues. Having had the original discs version, I expected this to basically be the same thing. Nope. First of all, any mission you do will not have any voices telling you what to do, especially in training missions.  Originally you had a ""co-pilot"" of sorts telling you what to do to help you, it's gone.  You're totally on your own to figure out what you're doing.  Half the controls don't work either, it says press K for a kneeboard (doesn't work), U for a mission compass (doesn't work) etc. It technically does work with a joystick, I'm attemping to use the same one I used before, but the calibration is totally off.  Even when the throttle is in the zero position, the plane thinks it's at 50% so good luck trying to land when the throttle won't go lower than half.  I haven't tried the xbox controller, and trying to fly with only a keyboard is a joke.I'm extremely disappointed in this.  Everything that's helpful and makes the game fun doesn't work.  This game totally leaves you to your own devices with zero assistance so unless you're a professional pilot, you'll be totally lost.  I can't believe the instructors/co-pilots don't work on this!

 Avoid at all costs! I was happy like everyone else to see FSX in Steam. Even though I already have purchased FSX Acceleration (most updated, complete version of FSX), I decided to purchase the Steam version because the FSX I had before was riddled with ""Fatal Errors"" and crashes. I was hoping that maybe, just maybe this is finally a stable and playable FSX.Sadly, I was very wrong. The game just stopped responding and crashed about 15 minutes into gameplay. Sure, there are many ""fixes"" if you keep googling, but why would anyone have to do that? This great game is sadly the product of terrible programming and lousy quality management.The developer/publisher was very sly in his Steam post when they said that they made some tweaks here and there. This gave me the impression that they actually fixed the stability issues. Needless to say, they did not.This is a classic example of betraying the fans just to cash in. Don't fall for this guys.PS Just for the record, I am running this on Windows 7 64-bit, i7 3770 (not overclocked), 16GB of DDR3 1600 memory and a Sapphire 7850 2GB. System is extremely stable for other games, but not this one.			"

												Upate to review:  So here we are just about a year on.  There has been no further development of the simulator.  But the DLC list has grown to a staggering $1,168.  We can officially bury all hopes that Dovetail was going to do something other than turn it into another catalog simulator like their Train Simulator has become.Original Review:While it's good to see FSX being picked up by Dovetail,  they could have done a much better job with their release of the steam edition.  I'm honestly on the fence as to recommending this... if you already own the boxed version and have addons... stay away from it.  If you don't have it and would like to get into FSX,  then it is worth it as long as you know the problems ahead of time.  Or in my case...  already own the boxed and have friends that have purchased this and would like to multiplay with me.  The positives of this edition is a working multiplayer system that is easy to navigate.  And that is part of the reason this game was gifted to me,  to multiplay with friends in the twitch community.  The cons:  Dovetail did very little research into what the FSX community is doing with the game and released a product that does not work with all the major payware addons that are most commonly used.  Have already pushed out a DLC that isn't worth the money,  a plane and some saved flight plans...  there are better freeware aircraft out there.  So to use my exisitng addons I have kept my old ""boxed""  copy installed so I can use my addons that I've purchased.  Can only hope that  Dovetail's track record so far with FSX is not going to be the norm that we see in the future.  Wait till the last minute to say they are putting this out,  putting out a product that does not work with the most common addons,  then putting out a DLC of a half finished aircraft with a handfull of saved flight  plans.

												This simulator appears to be very optimized. There's quite the choice of aircraft available and I've heard that this simulator has more out of the box than X-Plane 10. I would highly recommend using a joystick for this. My keyboard presses were delayed heavily making my plane go up and down like a wave. Thankfully, I found that you could use the mouse as a controller as well, which works great.I've seen that there were fan-made add ons that make this simulator have photorealistic graphics. As for how accurate the real flying is for the game, I'm not a pilot and this is my first simulator. But I'm sure that there are a lot of other reviews from actual pilots. EDIT: THEY HAVE MULTIPLAYER WITH VOICE???? WHAT???!!! Seriously. Get this game...i mean simulator.			"

												Ive owned the disc version of this FSX since it came out, and boy did I enjoy it!But, the time came where I had to upgrade from Windows Vista to Windows 8.I installed the disc version, but it was so unstable and unpredictable. Then, I heard about the Steam version of FSX, and I thought, hmm! That would be a good idea! So, I bought it as quickly as I could, and began playing as quickly as I could.But, I was really disappointed.The disc version may have been a RAM hog, but this version (in my personal experience) doesn't use enough. I am constantly losing textures, and sounds do not load directly on startup. My rig is more than powerful enough to handle this on highest settings, but I have had to downgrade from Ultra High to Medium for my textures to stay loaded in.Installing addons was a massive hassle for me. No matter what I tried, I could not get any addons to work. I checked the 'SimObjects' folder, made sure everything was there. But still nothing. Eventually, I gave up on adding in additional aircraft.Now, for multiplayer. Oh, multiplayer! What an experience several years ago when I was using the disc verson! But that has suddenly changed. I love being a traffic controller. but there's a bug for me that seems to want to keep me from being an ATC. No matter what I try, I cant become an ATC in a multiplayer session. My game just wont launch the game window. If I try pilot, it launches.Thats all I really have to say. If you want a much more stable version of FSX for Win7, Win8 or Win8.1. then this is for you. These three points above are the ONLY things bothering me, and I hope they get fixed in the future.Recommened for sure.This game was played on a computer with these specs:- Intel i5-4210U 2.7Ghz- 8GB DDR3 RAM- Intel HD Graphics 4400 2GB- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 830M 2GB- Windows 8.1 64bit			"

												Steam just saved FSX for me!I purchased FSX Gold Edition several years ago, and enjoyed playing singleplayer and multiplayer for many months. I especially enjoyed the multiplayer servers, being able to communicate with other players as pilots and ATCs. The multiplayer ran on the GameSpy service, which was taken offline some time ago, taking much of the fun away. I also installed several dozen extra planes from the internet in an effort to increase the variety and replayability of my disc copy. This, however, corrupted the files saved on my computer, and I was unable to reinstall the game from the disc after uninstalling it in an attempt to solve the problem. FSX was no more.THEN......... Steam releases Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam edition, and I immediately snatch it up on sale for 80% off -- $5From what I can tell, the Steam edition includes all of the content included in the disc Gold Edition, all bundled together and sold on Steam. And the best part is, Steam revived the multiplayer, and it now runs off of Steam, instead of GameSpy . Multiplayer is easy to connect to, has integrated steam friends support, and is very stable and quick. The game is almost perfect.My one non-positive comment about the game would be the fact that it CURRENTLY lacks Steam Workshop support. FSX is a great candidate for addons, as there are relatively few planes included in the official game. There are planes available on the internet for download, but it would be very helpful to have an integrated source on Steam for well-made downloadable aircraft. Overall I would give this game 9/10. If you like airplanes and/or sims, but this game. If this game is on sale, buy it even if you don't!			"

												First i am no hardcore pilot, i'm a fan of aviation and gaming. I got this game on sale for 18 BRL, around 5 USD.It's a decent game out of the box, but addons can make ir a lot better, there are free and paid ones. It has good mechanics, controls and cockpits are detailed (it's a 2006 game that received some updates), chopper mechanics are a bit choppy (pun intended), but planes run fine. The games suffer with some stability issues some crashes here and there (remember to save long haul flights), but nothing that renders the game unplayable. Multiplayer runs fine, if ping goes over 220ms, expect some choppiness. Voice chat is a disaster, keeps cutting players' voices, seems like there is zero audio buffering, i suggest using teamspeak some servers have their own TS channels.Missions are fun to complete, even though some objetives are not very clear for beginners.You can play it with a X360 controller, but i advise using a joystick, the tend to be a lot more precise.

												Really like this game, I discovered it through the boxed edition a while back, then switched to FSX-SE a few months ago on my new rig. No problem so far, integration into the Steam platform and community around is really great. I use external addons (like ORBX suite, REX4) and DLC addons, both work well. Eventually, having the game and its extensions in a cloud storage is a great advantage, and easier to use for the end user.  Concerning FSX, the fact that a 10 years old game remains on the spot and still creates so much interest is enough to say. The real strength pertains to its open platform. A complete ecosystem and market place for all sort of extensions and enhancements has raised through the years, so end users can fully personalize their simulator with all sorts of airplanes, sceneries, missions … Probably what gives this game such a never ending interest, as you create and evolve into your own flying experience and strategy, the exact way you intend. Really captivatingBlue skies to all! "

												At a little over 10 years old, this release (Steam) of Flight Simulator was one that I did not have. There is nothing I can say that has not already been said. I can say that I am glad I have this. I do recommend this to anyone who would like to pilot a real aircraft without all the responsibility attatched to being a real pilot. If nothing else the money this saves You in hangar fees for that plane that You probably do not need makes this a must for anyone interested in flight.

												First of all, don't believe the number on my profile, I've got nearly 10,000 hours to date(having played this long before Steam started putting it out). The frame-rate is much better on the Steam version, and the ability to use the internet to play multiplayer makes the game much better as a teaching tool(especially since Gamespy dropped FSX in 2009 or so, I think). Pros: The game is one of the most fun simulators out there.         You can use keyboard and mouse to fly, as well as any generic joystick and throttle.         With the Steam version, and the right microphone gear, it is very easy to talk with other players over the radio.Cons: The aircraft that come with the game are by default kind of clunky(This can be fixed with updates).           Also, there are only about 15 or 20 aircraft types you start with. The small number of choices can be augmented by a number of freeware and payware aircraft available over the internet. I would personally recommend Virtavia, RAZBAM and Ant's Airplanes.			"

The steam edition is running on full ultra settings and i'm gettiing 30 - 40 fps, it has never run and looked so amazing on my system in its life.For anyone who wants to try an exceptional flight sim or is an old dog on FSX I STRONGLY recommend you get this version.Great Job Dovetail for bringing an all time favourite back into my life.

												Exellent! The best flight sim out there! Control surfaces are 3D and fully functional, large variety of aircraft and helicopters, and extremly detailed scenery. There is a very large add-on community around the web,  both payware and freeware. For freeware I would recommend www.simviation.com and www.flightsim.com.  Both have very extensive libraries of free scenery, planes and other things for a variety of sims, as well as access to the flightsim store. IRIS Simulations, Virtavia, MilViz, and Aerosoft are some of the top payware aircraft manufacturers, some of the planes fully liscenced by their real life makers. 10/10 for this simulator.			"

												In my opinion, this is now the definitive version of FSX. Gone are the old problems of out of memory (OOM), as well as most of the ridiculous things that Microsoft never fixed. Dovetail has gone above and beyond the call of duty to bring new life to FSX Steam Edition, and it shows! The catalog of items on Steam that are compatible add-ons grows almost daily, and truth be told, about 98% of your previous add-ons WILL WORK with FSX-Steam Edition... Though they cannot ""guarantee it"". Take it from me, it works.If you are a long time simmer who for whatever reason stopped playing, there has never been a better time to download FSX-SE and fire up your favorite aircraft. I will see you in the virtual skies!I've since started showing FSX-SE off on youtube on my channel, and I am not disappointed. Thank you Dovetail!			"

Posted: March 15, 2015
												I had to wait until I had a substantial in-game time to actually review this fairly.  I think I've came to a conclusion.This is not a game, as anyone who sims would tell you.  Sure, there are little missions and things like that that you can play through and complete an objective, however, the core of the simulator is simply that: simulation.If you're thinking about buying FSX simply to play through and complete the missions, this is not for you.  Get a game like ""DCS: World"" or ""War Thunder"".  But, if you're part of the small niche that enjoys simulating real life flights, planning flights, practicing VFR or IFR, or anything along those lines, get it.  Even if you don't know much about aviation in general, but you are willing to learn, FSX is a great place to start.That being said, FSX isn't flawless.  Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition is not an exception to this.FSX: Steam Edition is simply a way to get into the wonderful world of flight simulation easily over the quick and painless Steam platform.  There are very minor improvements behind the scenes, but in terms of content and things like that nothing has really changed from what you can get out of the boxed Flight Simulator X.  The only big changes are the fact that ""Out of Memory Errors"" seem to barley ever happen.  (I've personally only experienced it once, and that was because I didn't tweak much of my game at all.)But that brings me to the next part of the entire Flight Simulator X experience, whether you're on the boxed version or Steam.  FSX needs addons, tweaks, and bugfixes.  Stock FSX, simply and quite frankly put, is rudimentary.  The flight models of aircrafts aren't nescessarily accurate and scenery isn't beautiful or photorealistic by any means.  On top of that, FSX can be heavily improved by turning on the buggy DX10 and using Steve's DX10 fixer, but that's another story.FSX also needs some tweaking to it's config files to work better on modern hardware.  But I'm not going to go into that, there are fantastic guides on the steam page, and internet, that will help you with that.The jist of what I'm trying to say is that FSX is something that you're either going to fall in love with, or become just another game that sits in your Steam library untouched.You'd want to expect to buy some nice aircraft.  (I personally recommend the ""A2A Cessna 172 Trainer"", fantastic attention to detail and flight model.)  Those cost money, and while there are freeware aircraft out on the internet, you aren't going to get the level of realism and immersion from big names like A2A or PMDG.  Scenery can be easily supplemented with addons like ""Active Sky"" or ""Orbx"" but even then it costs more money and more time from just simulation.  On top of that, you need either a joystick or a yoke and rudder pedals.  You're not going to get away for long just using keyboard and mouse.  It's just not fun.So in the end, yes I do reccommend this game.  Very much so, actually.  But you have to be willing to put forth the time and money it takes to get this game looking and feeling as real as it can.			"

This is the 3rd time I have bought this product and in ten years time if it is available to buy I will buy it again.It is the be all and end all of flight simulation, there is nothing to compare it to, it is peerless.There are of course other flight sims e.g X-plane that may have a better physics and flight engine, but as a whole gaming experience I still think FSX flies the highest. A deeper experience.And this is the first time I have been able to play it on ultra graphics settings.I loaded up, took off from Heathrow EGLL in a Lear Jet, flew low over London, turned right at the Post Office Tower and over Tower Bridge and landed at London City Airport. Watched a replay from London City Tower then wrote this review.Forget all other flight sims.As real as it gets. 12/10http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/05/15/best-simulation-games/ "

Anything above medium would cause the game to crash. I now run this at almost ultra everything including AA max and I'm getting over 60FPS at all times.  It's truly amazing what they have done to optoimize this and they are not getting enough credit!  For anyone doubting this or trying to decide between X-Plane or Prepar3d, look no fruther.  5 dollars, or even 20, is a way better deal than X-Plane and Prepar3d.  Seriously, this game runs so much differnetly now I still can't believe it.  Enjoy			"

												I have really missed playing this game over the years so I jumped on it when it was on sale.  Now I have found that apparently it was wasted money.  The game will only run in a small window.  It will not run full screen no matter what I try.  I have the latest video drivers and all system patches.  The game added another 12M patch today and I was hopeful that may have fixed it.  Guess not.  So far it is all but unplayable.  I am keeping my fingers crossed the bugs will get ironed out and I can again enjoy flying.  For now I can't recommend.			"

												Well... I love this sim but the MS version was just not being updated so things got a little slow. So I bought fsx se, the addons no longer work and one of them keeps asking for sp1 sp1 acceleration pack. Did dovetail leave something out? I, like many others have bought multiple addons, are we to assume that they no longer work? It would also help if someone from Steam or Dovetail monitored these boards and chirp in now and again ;)As it stands, for standalone function, great but incredibly boring. So it's a NO  from me...... seems a bit rushed and no one took into account the hundreds of addons that simmers have.... shame :(			"

												Excellent game and/or training tool for beginner and experienced real life pilots and ATC.First of all, lets get the bad out of the way. There aren't going to be many multiplayer servers near you, and if there is, they might be laggy. This game isn't easy to play. It actually required a considerable amount of knowledge. Basic manuvers are to par, but if you try something crazy you might be dissapointed in a lack of authenticity. Also, this game is almost impossible to play well without a joystick or USB yoke. Also the DLC is crazy expensive.I still have to recommend this game. There are plenty of community made aircraft and skins, and professional flight networks such as VATSIM that allow you to fly in a professional, no fooling around environment. Sometimes, the unrealistic aspect of the game makes great fun, and could make you laugh for a long time. Ever see a hot air balloon do a vertical up into space? Well now you can.Anyways 9/10, graphics are nice, if you like flying this product is for you. Try it out! "

												On the surface, Flight Simulator X seems like a bargain. However, I'd compare it to paying someone to kick you square in the nuts. Sure, initially it may seem like an exciting prospect, but once you experience the pain and frustration, it's not worth it. So, why would I say such a thing? First, it's unstable. The game crashes frequently (usually, after flying for 30+ minutes!) and the log book corrupts itself. Second, it's unpredictable. I've been unable to complete some of the missions due to the checkpoints not progressing. Third, it requires an additional hardware purchase. Were you planning on exclusively using a keyboard/mouse? Forget about it! You need a joystick. Using a keyboard/mouse is an ""all or nothing"" approach with no finesse (which you'll desperately need upon approaches and when taxiing). Now, if you already have a joystick and a VR headset, Flight Simulator X is probably an amazing experience, but for a non-pilot casual who just wants to fly some planes, you'll be disappointed (like me).

My friend just landed and I still can't get the game to run. Screw it! I'm done.

It's clear the devs got this barely working on Steam so they could pump out over priced DLC to hobbyists.Stop producing DLC's and polish your main product ffs.			"

												As a young kid, I was absolutely in love with planes and this game and I must have played at least 2000 hours of it before losing the disks. Anyway, when I saw this on sale I just had to buy it. Since then, I have remebered the bugs and poor optimization to be a problem, but, it's a fun, challenging, and detailed simulator nevertheless. Whether you like flying commercial planes, helicopter scenarios, or Redbull air racing shows, this game has all of that. Would only reccommend with a flight yoke or joystick though as the keyboard controls are straight garbage. Good luck getting it to run smoothly (or at all without crashes) on Windows 7/8 but once you get it working, you'll enjoy the work you put in.			"

												Same as ever;performance wise.Dx9 cpu bias,Dx10 Gpu bias.Seems much more stable,perhaps some bugs were indeed put right.Textures look basic 1080p and above;some add-ons (paid and freeware) use very hires textures,improving the look of aircraft and scenery.Its got game elements added as missions;don't get the impression its a game though.Its a serious attempt at destktop flight simulation.Loading times reduced win64.Much better loading times.Seems to handle big texture files much better,for instance no or little blurry image with vfr photo scenery .Draw distance as viewed from control tower seems less than boxed version.R9280 many dx10 preview problems in the visual department(Driver issue possibly dx 10 effects some only work in DX9 from older add-on aircraft)).DX9 glitch free.Keep in mind this was originally  released nearly ten years ago.*A souncard is recommended though it works fairly well on many built in audio chips.Sounds great on soundblaster z card.Needs add ons for aircraft and scenery if you intend to make it your serious sim.CPU and GPU overhead less than those needed in current build xplane10...Flight model with default aircraft is mixed,in terms of feel.(737 feels realistic for example)Default Cessna feels unrealistic.I recommend you buy  one A2A add-on with accusim bolt on.For Jet liner Captain sim or Pmdg.There are other other vendors that sell great aircraft,however i'd start here if you have a newish PC.Is it better than xplane?FSX has vastly better support,even now with freeware and payware.FSX is more friendly to use,the interface is still good.Fsx clouds/weather have little impact on framerates.Air traffic and atc are fully intergrated into FSX.It does not have a great flight model (Subsonic flight)or HDR lighting like XP10.Xplanes supersonic flight model has not worked properly in 18 months(still not fixed)Xplane has basic traffic and basic atc.The weather engine in xplane requires very high quality cpu to look good.Both need payware helicopter,if thats what you want to fly.Default choppers are awful in both flightsims.I like them both but cannot run xplane anywhere near maxed;Fsx is near maxed graphics wise on same desktop computer.Some people are having lots of issues with installers for add-on aircraft/scenery.Mainly down to old software not supporting Win7/8 properly.*What's working ,sort of working for me so far.:-Austria X works;finds the root then ok to make folder,installs fine thereafter.Justflights comet installs okJust flights Constellation pro okdodosim206(simconnect needs installing)minor sound bug)(earth sims soundscape may be the issue)realair spitfire is okvfr western isles ok(needs manual directing to correct folder)Alphasim hunter& F106 &F7u Cutlass,F104 ok(manual install)Fly the tigerX okA2A B377 accusim okvr insight hat track works with default aircraft,some minor issues with some 3rd party(usb2)Alphasim SR71 okVFR london ok(!!!!)Earth Simulations isles of man (Possible conflict with vfr london or aerosoft F16..i'm not sure which)Install IOM first!!!!./..DISC version;advice is(from internet) to disable internet connection before install otherwise it wont look for the discs at installation point.Installs to hardrive then unpacks then install to fsx (around 1 hr from discs)A2A P40 & P47 install okORBXpnw installs BUT!!!(area.149 /169etcetc add-on airfields CFG scenery not found)no idea why this shows up on scenery CFG.missing files upon loading(ORBX are looking at fixing the problem,which is good)Earth sims Alderney(V1)works perfectly.RealAir Duke V1.5 piston engine versionokPMDG MD11 works.Needs mine , pref above specs to fly it smoothly.Has a separate program running in background of FSX ,for increased realism compared to the default aircraft.VFR airfields vols1,2,3.ok(IOM by earthsims conflict with aiports disable in vfr3 configuration)On a personal note i'd like to say to potential buyers.This is an old programme ,lightly updated to work on modern versions of windows.IF you are expecting new features or improved graphic engine,you will be mislead.Keep this in mind before you buy.Issues are mostly Dx9/Dx10 compatability ;some add ons do NOT support Dx10 mode.Installer issues are down to old add-ons not putting the files in correct order with the Steam edition.

												After numerous bad experiences with ostensibly-well-reviewed flight simulators, I was beginning to think the genre wasn't for me any more, that maybe it was now inaccessible to anyone who didn't either have a real world pilot's license or Job-like patience.  I fondly remember spending hours trying to land my Cessna in the original Microsoft Flight Simulator, and the joy I felt when I finally got it right, but I just don't have that sort of time any more.I am glad to say Flight Simulator X brought that joy back.  It is not perfect by any means - the shell is a little unstable, alt-tabbing (on my installation of Windows 7 at least) means kissing your session goodbye, and the scenery is often somewhat lacklustre.  But it is accessible, and that counts for a lot.You get a wide variety of aircraft to play with, the game simulates the /entire world/, and you can choose the skill level that's right for you.  FSX ~wants to let you into its tree fort to play, and has very well done tutorial missions to get you up and running.  (A lot of simulators forget the importance of good tutorial missions.  If the tutorial missions aren't done well, the new user experience is likely to be limited to those missions and the 'Delete all local content' menu option on Steam.)  How far you want to take it is up to you, and you don't have to take it all as one lump - you can, for example, ignore the radio and navigation entirely if you so choose, and concentrate on learning to fly by the seat of your pants.  If you want to land on a carrier in oatmeal-thick fog on one engine, FSX will let you do that, too: enough real world pilots seem to play FSX that it doesn't seem likely it's been overly diluted.  FSX is, in other words, easy to learn but hard to master.  My advice for newbies is to take the ultralight, tune down the realism settings, and just enjoy flying around the photogenic city of your choice for a while.  Land on a scenic landmark or two, watch the AI traffic come in and out, then maybe try a short intercity hop or two.			"

												FSX:SE is a fantastic game and I really enjoy playing it :D The planes (mostly) handle well, scenery is Ok and sound... well I reccomend getting your own addon sound packs, the default ones are not very good. Recently though I have found that sometimes my plane will randomly start losing airspeed and the autopilot will pitch the plane's nose up 30 degrees or more leading to a stall unless the A/P is disengaged and the plane is manually flown which is very annoying especailly on a long flight! I also have GSX as an addon and have again recently found that many of the vehicles will appear hovering 50ft or so above my plane which has never happened before. I reinstalled GSX a few times and updated the addon manager even more times but still no fix :( All these problems have just started happening recently so I am not too sure what is going on. Oh well, I am getting pretty busy with my busines anyway so not a lot of time to play it but FSX:SE is still a great game and without the problems I definitely reccomend it!			"

												FSX alone has been my favorite sim and now FSX steam makes it even better. They added more plane and helicopters. The offline ATC works great and alot of 3rd party addons work too. The best part is multiplayer, the helpful ATC is there to guide you and even without them its a great and fun sim.			"

												It's everything I wanted and more. I played the original and still have it on disc, so I know what I'm talking about. It is just how it was many years ago. One thing that would be nice is some optimization, cause it is still really bad fps wise. I have it running at full and it barely holds 50 fps. That is with my 16 gigs of ram, 4790k, and 760 superclocked at 1100 mhz. I wish some of the earlier mods still worked with it though.			"

												This is my first simulator review and this game is very good in what it can do today. I used alot of addons for example, the PMDG aerosoft and some from justflight. yes I Put alot of money into this game and that what you need in order to play this like a pro and have the simulators full grip. Money is this games problem, it wants you to spend about over £300 and just so you can have a sessionand thats what buggs me about it, but either so the game is at its max when you do have the right aircraft and the right sencery. I had UK 2000 and the aerosoft Night Enviroment for the british isles and it was breath taking.Framerate is a problem in this aswell as many others I could point out what they are but this has been my biggest problem of all, 30 fps, yes Dovetail is not working on improving this and updating it to a 64-bit game, (lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s) so in all, if you love flight sim, get P3D. I have had 300 hours on the steam version and the other has been  many more in the boxed version to about 3000 hours on that. Game overall- 8/10 Sorry for my poor spelling.			"

												If you are into aviation an you just want to fly around and have fun this is completely PERFECT for you.If you are deep into it like me and you want to use it for training you have 2 choices.-Buying enormous amounts of Add-Ons for this game (For a PMDG aircraft(Most likely the 737), a higher quality scenery, airport scenery,ground cew add-ons(GSX) and maybe route planners(like PFPX) it would cost around 500 USD to have a fully imersive flight sim experience in FSX:SE but you would have a lot of troubles with OOM (Out Of Memory) errors because FSX is a 32bit based application it can only use 2 GB of memory and there are a lot of Fatal Errors because FSX was originally built for Windows XP not for Windows 8 or higher. I personally use PMDG 737 and 777 series with ORBX Global Scenery with KLAX Scenery(FSDreamTeam) with GSX and PFPX and its still very enjoyable.PROS AND CONS.Pros:-Easy to use -Full Controller support for XBOX Users and also Full Conroller support for PS4 users (with DS4Windows)!-Fully working multiplayer features -ATC Mode in multiplayer which allows you to regulate airspace(if other players cooperate)-Wide range of aircraft selection.-Fully controllable weather-Online weather (Updates every 15 mins)Cons:-32bit based-Compatibility issues with Windows 8 or higher (sometimes even with Windows 7)-Low texture quality-Badly OptimalizedI would rate this game 7/10 for people who wants to have fun not just train.For training i recommend : Prepar3D Professional License or Academic License.Over 500h of flight sim experience + 25h of real world experience.

												I love this game. i owned the box version and i got constant crashes and bad bad bad frame rates. Somehow the developers of this game has made it so much better. no ccrashing. no bad frame rates. not bad! the only thing i would sugguest is that you need to go to settings in the game and bump out the graphics and how things look. search on youtube to get the best performnce  from it. i would also highly  sugguest buying some payware addons. this game is great but for a better and immersive expirience you need maybe one or two addonss. for example the PMDG. great aircraft and better looking than teh default!!!! and maybe orbx scenery. having all this comes down to pc specs. if you have a 1ghz laptop/desktop it wont be any good. if you have a bad garphics card then it wont be as bad but i just gives that little extra.Great game! highly reccomend!

												One word: wonderful. To start with; the game itself didn't change that much compared to the boxed version. One of the best things of this version is the framerate. Dovetail did some engine tweaks which causes the game to run very smoothly now. Before this wasn't.Multiplayer is a sort of back, although there are (yet) a few servers and that's it. At least game-spy is done.Now, very important to remember: this is not a game. It's a simulator and basically it's kinda hardcore. Don't expect easy handling which makes you just fly. If you are thinking of buying this game, I recommend to buy a joystick as well. It gives you a better experience and makes it just easier.Addons on fsxinsider.com are payware (which means you have to pay for those addons) ones, yet there are a lot of freeware addons. Just google it.Now, the game doesn't really have downsides other than the few multiplayer server which people have to host themselves. And there is yet no working multiplayer with the boxed version. It seems they will possibly do some updates... I hope at least.In a nutshell:Buy this game if you are a aviation freak, and buy a joystick or a home cockpit if you want to play seriously. Don't expect this to be a game where you just fly, and I'd love to have people who want to play multiplayer seriously.			"

												As a young kid, I was absolutely in love with planes and this game and I must have played at least 2000 hours of it before losing the disks. Anyway, when I saw this on sale I just had to buy it. Since then, I have remebered the bugs and poor optimization to be a problem, but, it's a fun, challenging, and detailed simulator nevertheless. Whether you like flying commercial planes, helicopter scenarios, or Redbull air racing shows, this game has all of that. Would only reccommend with a flight yoke or joystick though as the keyboard controls are straight garbage. Good luck getting it to run smoothly (or at all without crashes) on Windows 7/8 but once you get it working, you'll enjoy the work you put in.			"

												Same as ever;performance wise.Dx9 cpu bias,Dx10 Gpu bias.Seems much more stable,perhaps some bugs were indeed put right.Textures look basic 1080p and above;some add-ons (paid and freeware) use very hires textures,improving the look of aircraft and scenery.Its got game elements added as missions;don't get the impression its a game though.Its a serious attempt at destktop flight simulation.Loading times reduced win64.Much better loading times.Seems to handle big texture files much better,for instance no or little blurry image with vfr photo scenery .Draw distance as viewed from control tower seems less than boxed version.R9280 many dx10 preview problems in the visual department(Driver issue possibly dx 10 effects some only work in DX9 from older add-on aircraft)).DX9 glitch free.Keep in mind this was originally  released nearly ten years ago.*A souncard is recommended though it works fairly well on many built in audio chips.Sounds great on soundblaster z card.Needs add ons for aircraft and scenery if you intend to make it your serious sim.CPU and GPU overhead less than those needed in current build xplane10...Flight model with default aircraft is mixed,in terms of feel.(737 feels realistic for example)Default Cessna feels unrealistic.I recommend you buy  one A2A add-on with accusim bolt on.For Jet liner Captain sim or Pmdg.There are other other vendors that sell great aircraft,however i'd start here if you have a newish PC.Is it better than xplane?FSX has vastly better support,even now with freeware and payware.FSX is more friendly to use,the interface is still good.Fsx clouds/weather have little impact on framerates.Air traffic and atc are fully intergrated into FSX.It does not have a great flight model (Subsonic flight)or HDR lighting like XP10.Xplanes supersonic flight model has not worked properly in 18 months(still not fixed)Xplane has basic traffic and basic atc.The weather engine in xplane requires very high quality cpu to look good.Both need payware helicopter,if thats what you want to fly.Default choppers are awful in both flightsims.I like them both but cannot run xplane anywhere near maxed;Fsx is near maxed graphics wise on same desktop computer.Some people are having lots of issues with installers for add-on aircraft/scenery.Mainly down to old software not supporting Win7/8 properly.*What's working ,sort of working for me so far.:-Austria X works;finds the root then ok to make folder,installs fine thereafter.Justflights comet installs okJust flights Constellation pro okdodosim206(simconnect needs installing)minor sound bug)(earth sims soundscape may be the issue)realair spitfire is okvfr western isles ok(needs manual directing to correct folder)Alphasim hunter& F106 &F7u Cutlass,F104 ok(manual install)Fly the tigerX okA2A B377 accusim okvr insight hat track works with default aircraft,some minor issues with some 3rd party(usb2)Alphasim SR71 okVFR london ok(!!!!)Earth Simulations isles of man (Possible conflict with vfr london or aerosoft F16..i'm not sure which)Install IOM first!!!!./..DISC version;advice is(from internet) to disable internet connection before install otherwise it wont look for the discs at installation point.Installs to hardrive then unpacks then install to fsx (around 1 hr from discs)A2A P40 & P47 install okORBXpnw installs BUT!!!(area.149 /169etcetc add-on airfields CFG scenery not found)no idea why this shows up on scenery CFG.missing files upon loading(ORBX are looking at fixing the problem,which is good)Earth sims Alderney(V1)works perfectly.RealAir Duke V1.5 piston engine versionokPMDG MD11 works.Needs mine , pref above specs to fly it smoothly.Has a separate program running in background of FSX ,for increased realism compared to the default aircraft.VFR airfields vols1,2,3.ok(IOM by earthsims conflict with aiports disable in vfr3 configuration)On a personal note i'd like to say to potential buyers.This is an old programme ,lightly updated to work on modern versions of windows.IF you are expecting new features or improved graphic engine,you will be mislead.Keep this in mind before you buy.Issues are mostly Dx9/Dx10 compatability ;some add ons do NOT support Dx10 mode.Installer issues are down to old add-ons not putting the files in correct order with the Steam edition.

												You have fond memories of playing this back in the day yes?Do you know the phrase:""Nostalgia is a dish best served by not playing it because you had way lower standards back in the day and todays games have ruined you with flash ease of use so if you tried it now you'd be ultimately disappointed you privileged, and in all likelihood,  white cis male.""Well it's not strictly true. MFSX is still the best pure flight sim around IMO			"

												Great fun, the same as the original FSX, but with the online back, making the game very enjoyable. Although, the 9 year olds with terrible mics still remain, alot of people know what they are doing, making the game quite realistic and fun. Having a flight stick imo makes the game easier and more realistic to play, but it isn't necessary and some people prefer playing without. Don't expect top of the line graphics, this game isn't new, it has just been moved to Steam. Overall, I really enjoy this game and if flying planes is your thing, I'm sure you will enjoy it too.			"

												I've had both FS9 and FSX since 2003 and 2010 and enjoyed both until all the good FS Host servers died and the MP feature of FSX was turned off. Just having MP back is good enough to buy the Steam edition, but there are other reasons also.  The game is more stable than the older box version, I've yet to have it crash because any one of the many dll's stopped working. The frame rates are better, not only faster but smoother too. In general to me everything about it seems new again. You only need to buy 3 things for FSX and the last one is optionalA good stick and throttle controllerPaid license for FSUIP to unlock your controllers full potential. You can use it for free but you only get just the barest of functionsA 3rd party weather program, this is optional as the live weather in the sim seems to be improved.Things I like about thisMore stable than the original releaseFaster frames and smoother graphicsMP is back (YAY!!!!!!!!!)Plays nice with your existing install if you have one.Things that I don't like ( most are not the fault of MS or DTG )We had to wait years for the sim to be improved with out buying PreParedSome 3rd party installers don't recognize the Steam install, and some 3rd party companies want you to pay again for a Steam compatible installerA few companies selling old products with a Steam installer with one texture and then selling the remaining textures as Steam DLC. Note, buy the regular installer if you can and point it to your Steam install, it will work and you save some money.Some MP servers are overrun with kids that think it's fun to override/monopolize comms, try to dog fight guys flying airliners and last but not least crashing into others for fun.As I said my dislikes are targeted at things outside of DTG and Steam, the game in itself is a revitalized gem and still has life like it's older FS2004 sibling despite it's old age at 9+years. The FS community is still strong with active forums, flight clubs and virtual airlines. There are thousands of addon aircraft, scenery repaints, sounds and more for FSX and it's all for free. Don't like the sound that the default DC-3 makes? change it, theres a freeware sound package that 4 times as large as the original. Want a VFA-31 texture for the default F/A-18 ? theres one out there along with many other Navy and Marine squadrons. Want the one airplane that you've loved for ever? chances are that it's out there to be downloaded. And best of all the things I mentioned are free to use, for everyone. Okay, you might have to buy a membership for faster download speeds but 90% of those sites still provide free access.   Buy it, fly it, you'll love it "

												The game looks promising:- complete Microsoft Flight Simulator X, even if few years old, still in some areas not surpassed by anything newer- easy to install thanks to Steam- includes Acceleration PackThere is however a catch:- the game is unstable, with AI traffic enabled the game crashes randomly, depending on AI density setting you can expect the crash to happen within 5-60 minutesWhat is promissing is that the current beta patch seems to fix those crashes for me. My current recommendation is: if you want to fly in a Free Flight mode, disable AI traffic or install the beta patch.			"

Yes, sometimes it might be not as realistic as it is in real life but..

The Multiplayer seems to be all there too with the Steam server so you can connect and Fly with other enthusiasts and friends now, which is good news and a lot less hassel.I got the premium edition which wqas on offer at the time and it came with a few extra bells and whistles so there are extra textures and Sky, airports, sounds rain, Thunder, wind, there are planes etc, which is good. All in all a good buy up to now, and very few if any at all problems. I'm on Win 10 it loaded up there was a error ""Vcredistx86"", but sorted that out by itself really.I do recommend this game, it's what i like in a flight sim. and if your new to flight sims you can't go to wrong with this one.

												Very good game - unfortunately not particularly fast - 35FPS on an AMD FX-6300 with an R9 270X, although this is understandable considering the game is quite old. I just hope this game doesn't get messed up by the new owners. Multiplayer is quiet but not empty.			"

The graphics are not the best, but it is indeed a huge game with dozens of city's, country;s and et to choose. But overall fanatsic game, i recommend it to anyone whoo;s like simulators or just flying.			"

												If you are into aviation an you just want to fly around and have fun this is completely PERFECT for you.If you are deep into it like me and you want to use it for training you have 2 choices.-Buying enormous amounts of Add-Ons for this game (For a PMDG aircraft(Most likely the 737), a higher quality scenery, airport scenery,ground cew add-ons(GSX) and maybe route planners(like PFPX) it would cost around 500 USD to have a fully imersive flight sim experience in FSX:SE but you would have a lot of troubles with OOM (Out Of Memory) errors because FSX is a 32bit based application it can only use 2 GB of memory and there are a lot of Fatal Errors because FSX was originally built for Windows XP not for Windows 8 or higher. I personally use PMDG 737 and 777 series with ORBX Global Scenery with KLAX Scenery(FSDreamTeam) with GSX and PFPX and its still very enjoyable.PROS AND CONS.Pros:-Easy to use -Full Controller support for XBOX Users and also Full Conroller support for PS4 users (with DS4Windows)!-Fully working multiplayer features -ATC Mode in multiplayer which allows you to regulate airspace(if other players cooperate)-Wide range of aircraft selection.-Fully controllable weather-Online weather (Updates every 15 mins)Cons:-32bit based-Compatibility issues with Windows 8 or higher (sometimes even with Windows 7)-Low texture quality-Badly OptimalizedI would rate this game 7/10 for people who wants to have fun not just train.For training i recommend : Prepar3D Professional License or Academic License.Over 500h of flight sim experience + 25h of real world experience.

												FSX:SE is a fantastic game and I really enjoy playing it :D The planes (mostly) handle well, scenery is Ok and sound... well I reccomend getting your own addon sound packs, the default ones are not very good. Recently though I have found that sometimes my plane will randomly start losing airspeed and the autopilot will pitch the plane's nose up 30 degrees or more leading to a stall unless the A/P is disengaged and the plane is manually flown which is very annoying especailly on a long flight! I also have GSX as an addon and have again recently found that many of the vehicles will appear hovering 50ft or so above my plane which has never happened before. I reinstalled GSX a few times and updated the addon manager even more times but still no fix :( All these problems have just started happening recently so I am not too sure what is going on. Oh well, I am getting pretty busy with my busines anyway so not a lot of time to play it but FSX:SE is still a great game and without the problems I definitely reccomend it!			"

												I love this game! i have 100 hours at the minute but their is a few problems. If you are getting this game to join a session with professional atc then your out of luck! You wont get that, the game is filled with trolls that bough the game in the sale that join a session, play crap down the mic, crash into you and have no intention of playing the game properly. If you want a completely proffesional game you will need to set up vatsim but first you need to know the ins and outs of the plane. FSX is like the tariner sim, atc arent that importatnt right now and you can just go on free flight if you want no trolls and have atc. However in multiplayer you can share your aircraft and if youy have a friend witht he game sharing the aircraft with them is awesome. In my opinion i would buy this game in a sale, when it is around £5 and if you really enjoy it and want a more professional sim, when you are ready download vatsim/vpilot buy a payware plane and maybe some scenery packs. Yes to really make the game amazing youy have to pay but in the end it is worth it.			"

												I used to have the boxed Gold Edition of FSX,basically the same as the Steam edition.I lost my download code and I could never play it again.Then,the Steam Edition came out,at the tim having an 80% DISCOUNT.Let's get onto the cons first:THE ONLY CONS:Still crashes sometimesShould give speed reduction instructions during approaches.Pros:EPIC MISSIONS putting you in real life scenarios;Landing a 747 in a monsoon?Engine failure in a 737 over the Indian Ocean?How about landing a CRJ-700 at St. Maarten?Over 24,000 airports with detailed and realistic gate,building,taxiway and runway locationsDetailed airplanes;Start from a little ultralight and work your way up to the 747-400.Each come with 3D cockpits which can be selected with F9.Multiplayer:GameSpy powered the old FSX Multiplayer,and unfortunately shut down.FSX Multiplayer here runs off Steam.So you can use your Steam ID to log in.Landmarks,roads,rivers and more simulated during the game.Ability to enable G-effects:Blackout when over-G,redout when under-G(Irritating when flying the F/A-18.Yes,there is a fighter jet here.Weapons not included,carrier tutorials are)Flight planner with waypoints,VORs,NDBs and more!Those were only part of this great game!9.9/10.Buy at all costs!

												Well, I have been on steam for a while, and since I am running on a low end computer I can't really use xplane all that well without it crashing(it is actually kind of weird, it works if I sit there for 10 minutes to load, but if I even click the screen once it crashes). I have been playing fsx for about 5 years now on the boxed edition, and steam edition seems to be running quite well. The multiplayer is what you remember from gamespy, a bunch of trolls and noobs who are pretty much idiots, but that is ok and expected, especially this early on.  Although the price has risen to almost 12$ now I would still recommend it. It doesn't crash half as much as the old version, and it runs quite a bit smoother.  Although I haven't tried much payware, freeware seems to run perfectly fine if you know what you are doing, and with fsuipc coming out only 2 days after the realese, it looks like it won't be very hard to put on a lot of payware, and there will soon be a community looking to modify it. If you already own fsx boxed version I would try and buy this as quickly as possible, because it soon won't really be worth your money to buy basically a upgrade with multiplayer. If you haven't ever owned fsx boxed, buy it, it will give you a lot of hours just exploring the vast world in different aircraft(even though I have been playing for nearly 5 years, I haven't even seen half of the airports this game has, which is something many exploring style games usually can't say), along with the realism of controlling virtual airplanes almost exactly like the real ones(although this feature will be coming soon once people figure out how to bring in pmdgs, A2a aircraft, etc. into the mix). Buy it and have fun!			"

												I've been playing Flight Sims for years. I tried a friend's copy of FSX years ago, and my computer was not up to snuff at the time. During it's time, it was cutting edge.Now, it runs amazingly well on my computer, which is a modest 3Ghz machine with 2 gigs memory running Windows 7. I've had 0 crashes, and am very pleased to see many add-on developers adding support for FSX:SE as well. The developer has made multiplayer work relatively well, as long as you know how to configure your firewall hardware or software. (This is an issue with ALL multiplayer games that don't just use a big central server.)On to the real review:   FSX is more of a simulator than a game. It cannot compare to the $200+ simulators out there, of course... but then again, it's around 10 years old. What it does have is BEAUTIFUL graphics, an amazingly huge world, and aircraft that respond in a realistic manner. Do not be heavy handed with the controls, you will meet Charlie Brown's Kite Eating Tree -- Only it's bigger, and eats 737's.   You get realistic ATC, wonderful weather, and a huge community of addon developers and players that adore flying and aircraft. You can fly with your friends, not only on missions and whatnot, but also both of you sharing control of one aircraft, to allow the more experienced pilot to train the less experienced.     The game includes tutorials on proper flight procedures, Air Traffic Control, single engine, multi engine, and commercial flight. This ""game"" is a wonderful experience for aircraft enthusiasts and comes out of the box with a wide variety of fun aircraft... IT is not a shooter, however. You won't be bombing places, or shooting down your friends... However, you CAN set up fly-in's, races, and many other fun activities!   Would recommend to anyone with a joystick, definitely! (Flying with the mouse and keyboard is doable, but not quite as fun, IMO)			"

												Really good game, like the original Flight Simulator X but with a better Multiplayer and support. If you are an aviation enthusiarm, then download this game. If you want the game to be more realistic, you should download addon scenery and aircraft, as the sceneries(airports)(e.g. taxiways, stands etc.) might be a little bit outdated. It is highly recommended also to buy a joystick or a controller, otherwise it is really hard to control the aircraft with mouse/keyboard. Generally, FSX:SE is highly recommended to anyone and expecially to aviation enthusiasm's.			"

												Having flown the boxed version of FSX Deluxe for many hours over many years, I was reluctant to go to the Steam version. But I'm glad I did.The multiplayer alone is worth the money, to be able to fly with other serious flight simmers is awesome and adds another dimension to the game.			"

I give up  my stupid unrealistic ""plane games"" and play this amazing stuff. It is challengeing. The only bad thing about it is that my game started to crash often after a few months of playing it.

												Really good game, like the original Flight Simulator X but with a better Multiplayer and support. If you are an aviation enthusiarm, then download this game. If you want the game to be more realistic, you should download addon scenery and aircraft, as the sceneries(airports)(e.g. taxiways, stands etc.) might be a little bit outdated. It is highly recommended also to buy a joystick or a controller, otherwise it is really hard to control the aircraft with mouse/keyboard. Generally, FSX:SE is highly recommended to anyone and expecially to aviation enthusiasm's.			"

												Still the golden standard of flight sims.Make sure you play with a joystick, even a cheap one. I got this game on sale for $4.99. Totally worth it. The game runs smoothly on my i5 laptop with 620M GT graphic card (lower mid-range). Some people complain about the missing SDK- I do not know much about this, but i hear that you can download and use the P3D 1.4 SDK in place of it.  You can buy DLCs from Dovetail, but you're perfectly free to ignore them and get 3rd party content elsewhere.One thing that is missing that I wish Dovetail would include was support for Steam features like trading cards, cards achievements and Steam Workshop. Right now Dovetail is focussing on making a new sim, (As of June 2015 still In early development according to DTG) which would probably have these  features. Until then, IMO this is still the best sim out there overall (default content, 3rd party content, community, realism, mods, etc). And it is an absolute steal if you can get it on sale for 5$.			"

												Amazing game! Great amounts of realism. I recommend studying up on checklists and YouTube videos etc. because this game is like the real thing, incredibly hard! After a while you get the hang of it. Plenty of DLCs from Steam and Third-Party add-ons (www.simviation.com they have tons of additional skins, liveries and planes). Also, the Multiplayer feature is amazing with real people being ATC or other pilots, however, I should warn you, turn collisions off before entering MO, the 10-year olds love to troll.10/10 would fly again.10/10 would crash into a 9-year old screaming how to turn his engines on.

												Overall what I expected, Even though I had to spend just as much time (maybe more) searching up controls, tutorials and tips on google and youtube, then I actually spent flying. I thought this would be just another flight game, and tried the Boeing-747 on my first flight. I almost♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥myself trying to take off with just my keyboard controls. This is a game that I had to learn over the past few hours, and eventually.. it got fun. I may not know everything about flying, but at least i can take off and ♥♥♥♥ around with the pretty lights and make air traffic control go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by asking them to repeat themselves 100 times. SO overall I give this game a 8/10. its pretty easy as long as you act like you know what your doing.			"

												Realistic simulator! I feel like I'm flying a plane! 10 years old and still great! It has been optimized and now uses 4 cores and is not a single threaded application. Expect 30-40FPS during takeoff using an ivybridge @ 3.0Ghz. Once you're airbourne FPS will be way above 60.The graphics aren't perfect, still some jagged lines at 1080p with 8XMSAA, MLAA. But the planes still look awesome!There are plenty of mods for textures and aircraft online. SOME are buggy. (dont have autopilot, full cockpit views exc.) But there are quite a few good fully functioning aircraft. The mods are freeware, most requiring installs or simple drag and drop.I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who likes simulators. It takes real world time and patience to fly somewhere. A joystick is also highly reccomended. If you don't like simulators... ""Don't sink! Don't sink!""			"

												amazing simulator, although the graphics are a bit well... old-ish i could say, it is a very good simulator, the default planes are okay, a good place to start, but payware addons expand out to an amazing world of simulationhere are my top payware producers1) Aerosoft, their Airbus X is amazing, along with their twin otter, can not wait until they release their CRJ2)PMDG, this company makes pretty expensive aircraft but their 737 and 777 along with their upcoming 747 V2 are definetly worth the extra penny (or 50 bucks to be real)3)Captainsim, i have seen many people criticize captainsim for not being realistic enough, but they have amzingly detailed flight models including full cabins on most of their aircraft, along with visually capturing cockpits, if you are looking to get into simulation or are switching from another sim (I.E, X-plane 10) you should definetly give this a try			"

												As an actual pilot, I can't get enough of this sim. It ably keeps up to date with local topography, landmarks, and airports, the way others, like x-plane, wishes they could. The planes are realistic and fly very similarly to the real deal. Whenever I have an upcoming trip to an unfamiliar destination, running it in FSX is now a part of my flightplanning. It is a must have for all aviation enthusiasts. The missions are a wonderful slice of life in aviation. Easy enough to be approachable, but they never patronize the player.  "

												IDK what to say that hasnt been said already about fsx.  everything about it is awesome except for the prices, even when on sale, planes are overpriced and scenery should be in the game automatically.  bridges are not solid usually, but a chain link fence will destroy a 747.  As for the positive aspects of fsx, there are many... straight forward flying, no invisible walls saying ""cant fly here srry"", most of the best airports are included and fairly detailed, its also nice to have most joysticks set up automatically with basic flight controls just by plugging in, decent selection of common airplanes come with it (most arent 100% functional tho), online multiplayer is the best part of fsx (pilot/ co- pilot capabilities, formation flying, live atc), finally the last thing i will say about fsx is that theres a reason its been around for so long...its a taste of quality in a world of sub- par software and overpriced/ flashy graphics.  just want a simulator to be a simulator without the need for a 5000 dollar gpu? ...FSX "

												I've been playing Flight Sims for years. I tried a friend's copy of FSX years ago, and my computer was not up to snuff at the time. During it's time, it was cutting edge.Now, it runs amazingly well on my computer, which is a modest 3Ghz machine with 2 gigs memory running Windows 7. I've had 0 crashes, and am very pleased to see many add-on developers adding support for FSX:SE as well. The developer has made multiplayer work relatively well, as long as you know how to configure your firewall hardware or software. (This is an issue with ALL multiplayer games that don't just use a big central server.)On to the real review:   FSX is more of a simulator than a game. It cannot compare to the $200+ simulators out there, of course... but then again, it's around 10 years old. What it does have is BEAUTIFUL graphics, an amazingly huge world, and aircraft that respond in a realistic manner. Do not be heavy handed with the controls, you will meet Charlie Brown's Kite Eating Tree -- Only it's bigger, and eats 737's.   You get realistic ATC, wonderful weather, and a huge community of addon developers and players that adore flying and aircraft. You can fly with your friends, not only on missions and whatnot, but also both of you sharing control of one aircraft, to allow the more experienced pilot to train the less experienced.     The game includes tutorials on proper flight procedures, Air Traffic Control, single engine, multi engine, and commercial flight. This ""game"" is a wonderful experience for aircraft enthusiasts and comes out of the box with a wide variety of fun aircraft... IT is not a shooter, however. You won't be bombing places, or shooting down your friends... However, you CAN set up fly-in's, races, and many other fun activities!   Would recommend to anyone with a joystick, definitely! (Flying with the mouse and keyboard is doable, but not quite as fun, IMO)			"

												Well, I have been on steam for a while, and since I am running on a low end computer I can't really use xplane all that well without it crashing(it is actually kind of weird, it works if I sit there for 10 minutes to load, but if I even click the screen once it crashes). I have been playing fsx for about 5 years now on the boxed edition, and steam edition seems to be running quite well. The multiplayer is what you remember from gamespy, a bunch of trolls and noobs who are pretty much idiots, but that is ok and expected, especially this early on.  Although the price has risen to almost 12$ now I would still recommend it. It doesn't crash half as much as the old version, and it runs quite a bit smoother.  Although I haven't tried much payware, freeware seems to run perfectly fine if you know what you are doing, and with fsuipc coming out only 2 days after the realese, it looks like it won't be very hard to put on a lot of payware, and there will soon be a community looking to modify it. If you already own fsx boxed version I would try and buy this as quickly as possible, because it soon won't really be worth your money to buy basically a upgrade with multiplayer. If you haven't ever owned fsx boxed, buy it, it will give you a lot of hours just exploring the vast world in different aircraft(even though I have been playing for nearly 5 years, I haven't even seen half of the airports this game has, which is something many exploring style games usually can't say), along with the realism of controlling virtual airplanes almost exactly like the real ones(although this feature will be coming soon once people figure out how to bring in pmdgs, A2a aircraft, etc. into the mix). Buy it and have fun!			"

												Such a Good game. A very realistic representation of flight. Pro's:-Cheap-High FPS-Optimised for windows 10 (unlike X-plane)-Has many DLCs, both payware and freeware-Good support in ther community if you have a promblemCon's:-Graphic aren't that great, planes are fine but airports an scenery could be better.-To get the sim looking good you have to have to buy addons that can get very expensive-Some adddons from FSX:Acceleration, X-plane and P3D have yet to be optimisedConclusion:I would reccomend FSX for anyone who plays flight simulators or wants to, it is a good starting point. Apart from a few bugs and pet grievences it is ver PC friendly and runs smoothly. If you have a limited budget to spend on a simulator, about £20. If you are into simulators and are willing to shell out £100 I feel P3D is a better options as it rund better and has more compatability with Addons			"

												Realistic simulator! I feel like I'm flying a plane! 10 years old and still great! It has been optimized and now uses 4 cores and is not a single threaded application. Expect 30-40FPS during takeoff using an ivybridge @ 3.0Ghz. Once you're airbourne FPS will be way above 60.The graphics aren't perfect, still some jagged lines at 1080p with 8XMSAA, MLAA. But the planes still look awesome!There are plenty of mods for textures and aircraft online. SOME are buggy. (dont have autopilot, full cockpit views exc.) But there are quite a few good fully functioning aircraft. The mods are freeware, most requiring installs or simple drag and drop.I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who likes simulators. It takes real world time and patience to fly somewhere. A joystick is also highly reccomended. If you don't like simulators... ""Don't sink! Don't sink!""			"

												IDK what to say that hasnt been said already about fsx.  everything about it is awesome except for the prices, even when on sale, planes are overpriced and scenery should be in the game automatically.  bridges are not solid usually, but a chain link fence will destroy a 747.  As for the positive aspects of fsx, there are many... straight forward flying, no invisible walls saying ""cant fly here srry"", most of the best airports are included and fairly detailed, its also nice to have most joysticks set up automatically with basic flight controls just by plugging in, decent selection of common airplanes come with it (most arent 100% functional tho), online multiplayer is the best part of fsx (pilot/ co- pilot capabilities, formation flying, live atc), finally the last thing i will say about fsx is that theres a reason its been around for so long...its a taste of quality in a world of sub- par software and overpriced/ flashy graphics.  just want a simulator to be a simulator without the need for a 5000 dollar gpu? ...FSX "

												Really good game, like the original Flight Simulator X but with a better Multiplayer and support. If you are an aviation enthusiarm, then download this game. If you want the game to be more realistic, you should download addon scenery and aircraft, as the sceneries(airports)(e.g. taxiways, stands etc.) might be a little bit outdated. It is highly recommended also to buy a joystick or a controller, otherwise it is really hard to control the aircraft with mouse/keyboard. Generally, FSX:SE is highly recommended to anyone and expecially to aviation enthusiasm's.			"

												With this game on a big sale right now, there are certain to be people on the fence about buying this game.  I thought it is time for me to write a review on this game.Over the past year, I have tried all of the current ""big three"" sims: FSX (got it 75% off), X-Plane 10, and Prepar3D v3.  I also have Dovetail Flight School and even FlightGear.  Out of all five, FSX:SE is by far my favorite.Yes its technology (32 bits and unfinished DirectX 10) is aged by today's standards.  However, I myself am a diehard retro gamer and I am able to overlook its age to make the most of a sim that is still relevant in today's market.Its greatest strengths are:-Diversity in gameplay.  You can take lessons and try to pass checkrides, fly in a variety of missions, or go on a solo or multiplayer free flights.  The game has GA aircrafts, airliners, a helicopter, a glider, and a few other aircraft types right out of the box.  Even if you don't feel like flying, you can read its vast in-game library to learn about the game and the planes' different features and how they are used in real life.-Expandability.  The default terrain is a a bit bare (but still waaay better than FlightGear).  There is a good number of add-ons available through Steam, and around 75% of the add-ons designed for boxed FSX still work for FSX:SE with no or only a little tweaking.  The default game will keep you busy for many months and the add-ons will keep you busy for YEARS.-User friendliness.  Almost everything works right out of the box.  Yes there are a couple of bugs that DTG unfortunately cannot fix due to its distribution agreement with Microsoft, but some of them can be fixed by the players with the right amount of research (and back up all originals!).  The in-game options, AI planes, ATC, dials and gauges, four seasons landscape, real-time weather, map, flight planner, rewards, and frame rate all work.  You can start on the runway or at any of the parking or gate area in the game's 20,000 airports.  You aren't given a million options to choose from just so you can set the game the way you like it and take to the skies.People very new to flight simmings or to aviation in general will not have their hands held - they will still need to take the lessons, read the library, do additional research online, and invest in at least a cheap joystick to make the most of their experience.  That is where many would-be simmers give up.  If you want to fly as soon and as easily as possible, this sim is not for you.  If you want to learn how to fly and enjoy the rewards out of doing so, this sim is for you.Will FSX:SE be our go-to flight sim forever?  Maybe not forever, but for at least for the rest of this year, yes.  Prepar3D (based on FSX) is still boring and built on old technology despite its price tag.  X-Plane 10 baits and switches for sales and still can't offer detailed airports, good ATC, and the four seasons right out of the box.  Dovetail Flight School is missing too many features for serious simming, but the upcoming Dovetail Flight Simulator may be FSX:SE's rightful replacement.  FlightGear is admirable, but it is freeware for a reason.So in short, if you are interested in aviation and you are willing to learn, then take advantage of this sale.  FSX:SE, sale or not, is an affordable and accessible entry point to the wonderful hobby of flight simulation.			"

												Considering this Sim came out in 2006, it is still one of the best Flight Sims to date. The downside is that the dated landscapes look more like the Sim was greated over a mapping of Google Earth from 2006.The upside is that with all the mods available, the ground can be improved on a basic level across the entire globe or in higher detail in certain regions. With payware mods like REX or Soft Clouds, you can dramatically improve the skys, water and some airport ground textures.Since you can load real weather into this Sim with no mods added, I too must agree with many, this is the best Flight Sim (for real Aircraft flying).  Thr learning curve may be steep but the rewards are many.			"

												I've had both FS9 and FSX since 2003 and 2010 and enjoyed both until all the good FS Host servers died and the MP feature of FSX was turned off. Just having MP back is good enough to buy the Steam edition, but there are other reasons also.  The game is more stable than the older box version, I've yet to have it crash because any one of the many dll's stopped working. The frame rates are better, not only faster but smoother too. In general to me everything about it seems new again. You only need to buy 3 things for FSX and the last one is optionalA good stick and throttle controllerPaid license for FSUIP to unlock your controllers full potential. You can use it for free but you only get just the barest of functionsA 3rd party weather program, this is optional as the live weather in the sim seems to be improved.Things I like about thisMore stable than the original releaseFaster frames and smoother graphicsMP is back (YAY!!!!!!!!!)Plays nice with your existing install if you have one.Things that I don't like ( most are not the fault of MS or DTG )We had to wait years for the sim to be improved with out buying PreParedSome 3rd party installers don't recognize the Steam install, and some 3rd party companies want you to pay again for a Steam compatible installerA few companies selling old products with a Steam installer with one texture and then selling the remaining textures as Steam DLC. Note, buy the regular installer if you can and point it to your Steam install, it will work and you save some money.Some MP servers are overrun with kids that think it's fun to override/monopolize comms, try to dog fight guys flying airliners and last but not least crashing into others for fun.As I said my dislikes are targeted at things outside of DTG and Steam, the game in itself is a revitalized gem and still has life like it's older FS2004 sibling despite it's old age at 9+years. The FS community is still strong with active forums, flight clubs and virtual airlines. There are thousands of addon aircraft, scenery repaints, sounds and more for FSX and it's all for free. Don't like the sound that the default DC-3 makes? change it, theres a freeware sound package that 4 times as large as the original. Want a VFA-31 texture for the default F/A-18 ? theres one out there along with many other Navy and Marine squadrons. Want the one airplane that you've loved for ever? chances are that it's out there to be downloaded. And best of all the things I mentioned are free to use, for everyone. Okay, you might have to buy a membership for faster download speeds but 90% of those sites still provide free access.   Buy it, fly it, you'll love it "

												Microsoft Flight Simulator (FSX) is a very realistic and accurate simulator. The controls and various gizmos in the cockpit is surprisingly very accurate and the reaction time for the controls is very realistic. Although you only get a certain amount of aircraft before you have to buy other aircraft, the starting aircraft is a wide range from microlites to a full Boeing 747-400. An almost spot on aviation simulator.The main postives for me are:-Realistic controls-Realistic Cockpit/Flight deck-Realistic looking aircraft-Near to none lag-Flight plans-Logs the flight hours and the aircraft you where inNegatives for me are:-Low detail for the ground/airports-Some buttons in the cockpit can't be used-No emergency features for free flight-Can't move around much in the aircraftOverall Microsoft Flight Simulator is a great game/simulator and I would reccomend this to anyone that likes aviation orjust wants to see how a airplane works.

												I'll preface this by saying I've been using Microsoft (formally) Flight Simulator since 1993 and I've been flying real planes as a pilot for the majority of my life.As a pilot in real life, Flight Simulator has been an integral part of my training and keeping me fresh. Though I wouldn't recomend as a sole source for ground training, you can develop some bad habbits up in a real plane if all you know is this simulator.The game has a HUGE community of modders, thousands-if not MILLIONS of mods/downloads. The Earth in FS is a 1:1 scale of the real Earth as far as I know.Without mods, I'm not particularly a fan of the helicopter physics nor the average stall physics.If you're at all interested in aviation, it's a mistake not to buy this.

												I have to say that this is now my favourite game, when you buy this game is not good game at all, you have default aircrafts and default terrain it dosent look like in real world and the aircrafts doesn't do things like the real ones, but there are shops like Aerosoft or PMDG which when you buy some product from them it very intresting and fun, because it more realstic and also the optionos are good.I would recommend this game for people who has a lot of money because the default game is borring and optinos in default are very very bad!But as I said when you buy some realistic aircraft or scenery it georgus!Also I don't understand why is this game on steam for 20+ € because this possibilities of this game don't match the price! ... When is it in sale for 4 € then the price match options of game!  "

												Flight Simulator 10 is an odd duck of a game to be sure. I feel some days it is not as much a game but an operating system. The potential is one of the allures to the game, some days it feels like it is as close as you can get to real world flying and have fun doing it. I own X plane 7 and 9 do not want to argue about realism.  X plane is the cheapest wind tunnel you can buy it can simulate planes that do not exist yet and can do things by the numbers, It is technically better a better simulator, so why not just fly X plane?  I have never been able to completely switch over because Flight Simulator feels more fun. X Plane uses a Blade element theory to figure out flight.  Lift is simulated by flowing virtual air over an approximation of a virtual wing. This is very good, the feeling of lift and interaction of lift and balance of a plane is well represented. If you design a new plane and want to sort of know if it works you can. It falls short where there are odd drag or flow interactions on a plane that make the perfect math model not match the real world. Flight Simulator 10 uses Table lookup so the planes are more of a grab bag. They only can simulate the Data and are only as good as the Data in the table. Some mod planes all feel the same because they don't have the flight model they deserve. It is cheaper to calculate the plane this way computer wise.  It has fun multiplayer and with a good plane it is wonderful. If I were to start today I would buy FSX 10 and the A2A piper cub  and a Joystick, and have fun.Flight Simulator is not a trouble free game; it is much better as the steam edition then the boxed version of the past. All problems are solvable with some reading, and people are usually nice and knowledgeable. I needed to install the Orbx Felts field and had an error of missing building tops  I needed to write into a forum to get an answer, and it has been patched, but sometimes things don’t always work as you would expect them. I have had good luck with windows 10 no real errors or crashes when flying. I found if when I am choosing a flight and click out of the game window and start looking stuff up on line or starting other programs it will get mad at me and crash. It is a far cry from the boxed edition when I would save on a schedule so I didn’t have to start the flight over from the beginning and crash at the same spot. As long as the crashes are just in the menu and only because I am trying to multitask I can live with that. I also hope with continued development we will see 64-bit version in the future.If you want to shoot down stuff, have latest technology or have a very short attention span then this game is not for you. If you love learning new things, detail, tinkering, flying, messing with how computers and graphics work, moding, or honing a skill this could be the game for you. I own but not the steam version of the A2A cub so I can’t review it on steam, but you can paddle it out on a lake and prop start it like a world war I plane and it is just fun. A2A is one of the best companys out there for DLC for FSX please support them. Can’t recommend the plane enough hope to see more Orbx and A2A stuff on steam.  "

												I have to modify my review.  Despite the bugs and whatnot.  They game is quite good, and has a multitude of remote airstrips, including grass strips that I was surprised to see.  To reduce bugginess, change any settings before starting your flight.  Accessing the ALT menu seems to reduce the amount of time you can fly before the game crashes.Alright, so the graphics are quite nice on this Simulator.  This makes for some nice immersion.  However, I'm getting into flying in the real world, and wanted to do some practice flights that I might actually fly to get a feel for them.  I enabled updating weather and everything.  (Highly recommend using the current weather settings)  Here's what would continually happen.  I would take off flying the piper cub, circle slowly to the correct heading and maintain my climb.  Finally I'd level off and settle in for a relaxing flight to a nearby lake.  Suddenly the Windows spinng wheel of loading pops up, and the game closes.  It says checking for problems, a fatal error has occured.  Restarting Microsoft Flight Simulator X.  After all that I'm staring blankly at the setting screen which has also lost the majority of my settings that I just customized.  Ok it's a fluke, let me try again.  After 5 attempts at this, and the game ""automatically restarting,"" I searched for similar occurances.  It seems this game has a good deal of bugs that just simply aren't fixed.  I'm so frustrated, that I may switch back over to GEFS (Google Earth Flight Simulator)  It runs on your browser and has ok graphics.  Oh, and it doesn't randomly crash.			"

												I really recommend this game.For W8.1 people: This game may work. It may not. It works for me, so I'm posting a positive review.I can fly anywhere in the world. This game is truly amazing. There are over 20,000 airports in this game. Even in a small island country there are airports. If you don't have a joystick yet, you can still play this game but I'd really recommend getting a joystick as it's sort of hard to control the plane with just the keyboard. If you're flying a jet, you're more than likely going to be using autopilot most of the time, so it won't really matter anyways.At the time of posting this (22/12/14)  a lot of addons for the DVD game isn't working. The devs may fix that, they may not.  However, the amount of content in this game is still outstanding. You have over 20 planes that you can play and mess around with it. If you really like flight games, then this is the game for you.If you'd like a more combat-oriented game, then check out DCS world. FSX doesn't have any combat whatsoever.			"

												I had been a onwer of the boxed version of this before but Dovetail has improved bits of pieces of this game.The good:Dovetail improved this game a lot than when the original dev them would have. The recent framerate fix really feels like to fly payware aircraft or fly through cities that requires a lot of power on a computer.They updated the multiplayer since GameSpy is really redundant now.The game will no longer crash if there's a memory problem.The game works in Windows 8.1 and I'm running as of right now as I'm writing this.I really not sure about if they ever improved anything else besides on what they fixed.The bad:Lack of support for addons (not DLCs Dovetail are releasing for this) meaning that people that makes payware aircraft and scenery to be tested prior to releasing it to the public to buy. I had tested some that were released and some of them will work and some will not. Its still FSX but some of the installers wouldn't find where the acutal install of the game is.I'm really not complaining about the rest of the game expect for this. There's also a sound bug that hasn't been fixed yet on the default Goose plane when while change the view to cockpit when the thorttle is idle. That can be a easy fix by messing its sound.cfg. All other default aircraft are fine as there is no issues with them.			"

												Microsoft Flight Simulator has been THE simulation program for many flightsimmers out there for years.From the smallest prop planes to the biggest jumbojets, people have enjoyed FSX, and surely will for the coming time.Many add-ons have been made for FSX, and while FSX:SE is slightly different, a lot of add-ons have been updated to work under this version as well. Also, while Gamespy is no longer, multiplayer has been fixed to work via the Steam platform itself.Does this mean it's the holy grail for home user simulation? Not really. While at the moment it's a working platform, Dovetail does not have the appropiate license to make big changes to the program like Lockheed Martin is allowed to in their Prepar3D program, based on the same Microsoft software.In the long run (years) FSX:SE in its current form will be obsolete and outdated. While LH Prepar3D and LR X-Plane are actively being developed, FSX:SE does not have that luxury.At the moment it's still an awesome platform, and anyone who wants to fly can do so no problem in FSX:SE. Including all those awesome add-ons that have been made for FSX over the years.Hopefully Dovetail Games will be able to upgrade the program in one way or another in the future.			"

The original crashes from time to time, the Steamedition had no crash at all since installation and I use all my addons, i have, except PMDG, as they are in the process of update for FSX Steam. So I can really recommend the steam edition for all FSX fans, not satisfied with their original FSX installation.			"

												Great when you can get it on sale for $5 like it was during the holidays, but I'd personally hold off at the normal price.  Things like TrackIR do not work out of the box and involves having to manually copy a couple of files around each time the game updates.  There are instructions on here on how to do it.  Also if you have a lot of DLC that has been purchased over the year beware it may not work on the steam edition.  I still have version 1.0 for MD-DOS on floppy disc and now I own the last version.  However after FS9 I switched to Xplane to keeps skills up as flying became prohibitively expensive over the past decade for civil aviation.  If you are a flight student or professional pilot then you'd be better off taking a look at X-plaine or Lockheed's DX 11 version Prepar3d.			"

												This game and I have had an extremely long relationship. Back when I had just turned 10 years old I saw a youtube video of a trike ultralight landing at a major airport in fsx and I thought to myself, it would be cool to do that. Then I quickly searched it up and came up with a sight where I could download the demo. At the time I was really into the show ""Flying Wild Alaska"" on the Discovery channel which was about pilots making a living flying in Alaska. So, as soon as I got in game my goal was to recreate the flights in the show. In the demo you got only a few planes a few airports and a few missions and it put you in TNCM which is near the equator so my hopes of recreating those flights were ruined... Or were they? After a while of messing about only using keyboard and mouse (and pausing the game every 3 seconds to make adjustments) I realised that this would probably be easier with a controller so I pulled out my Dad's old Microsoft Precision Pro (Best joystick ever nothing even comes close in my opinion) and found the USB adapter plugged it in and had a go. I quickly realised that it was so much easier to control with a joystick and my interest for the game only grew. After a while of searching on the internet I found a freeware website where I could get planes and scenery made by others and then I realized that I could recreate the flights in the show with those planes. I downloaded a bunch of single engined props and started messing with the weather to get the desired conditions. After an hour of having fun with that I realized 2 things 1: Demo limits your time 2: Some guages in freeware aircraft are missing. This kind of lowered my hopes as I thought I would have to pay hundreds for the full version but when I searched it on Amazon it was only $35 and It was close to my birthday so I made my parents get it. While waiting for FSX to arrive I came across the FSX film making communities on Youtube and fell in love with this video: 


YouTube™ Video: Vectors - an FSX Film

			A Qantas 747 arrives in San Francisco...		

 And that gave me a new goal: Find all the planes in that video and install them. When I got the game though, I forgot all those goals, installed the game, and installed a freeware Tiger Moth Biplane. Then I proceded to start a five hour flight Between Denver Intl. and Housten. this took me a few days at about an hour each day and a lot of saving. After completing the flight I started to explore the other parts of the game and this led me to multiplayer. From there I found a server which was doing landing competions I joined in the middle of one, failed and strived to be the best at the competitions which improved my overall game skill. (Big Shoutout to kilocharlie1, he and I have been friends since 2011 and met during one of his landing competitions). During the next 3000 hours spent on the boxed version of FSX I learned more and had more interactions with people with interesting perspectives and thoughts than I ever had in my real life. I went through multiple ""Phases"" while playing this game also like ""craving"": Pre-WWI aircraft, Biplanes with exposed radial engines, WWII aircraft, Turboprops, A2A only aircraft, etc. and all that research into those aircraft and such gave my more historical knowledge than I had ever learned in school. It also helped me gain the abilities to think logically and visually and to deeply understand certain workings of physics even though I had never studied them deeply before this game. This game is what brought me into PC gaming, kept me busy, educated me, and entertained me. Would HIGHLY reccomend  for anyone of any background of nearly any age to experiment and have fun in.			"

												I'm a confirmed FSX addict. When Steam offered the Dovetail Games version, I happily purchased it. The simulator offers plenty, from better frame rates and smoother flights to improved memory management. I'm disappointed in the overall experience, though, and can't recommend you buy at this time.Over 80% of my flights end in a crash-to-desktop, the dreaded ""terrain.dll"" error (as recorded by Windows). I've tried many dozens of fixes proposed on various forums, to little avail. I did find that Dovetail had left a key Redistributable (C++ 2013) out of their package, and even that hasn't been corrected. It appears that Dovetail is simply harvesting cash from the unsuspecting public at this point, as there has been zero response from their Customer Support.At this point I plan to uninstall FSX:SE and return to my previous version. Hopefully someday Dovetail will make the necessary corrections, and then I might try again.			"

												I have to say that this is now my favourite game, when you buy this game is not good game at all, you have default aircrafts and default terrain it dosent look like in real world and the aircrafts doesn't do things like the real ones, but there are shops like Aerosoft or PMDG which when you buy some product from them it very intresting and fun, because it more realstic and also the optionos are good.I would recommend this game for people who has a lot of money because the default game is borring and optinos in default are very very bad!But as I said when you buy some realistic aircraft or scenery it georgus!Also I don't understand why is this game on steam for 20+ € because this possibilities of this game don't match the price! ... When is it in sale for 4 € then the price match options of game!  "

												I have to modify my review.  Despite the bugs and whatnot.  They game is quite good, and has a multitude of remote airstrips, including grass strips that I was surprised to see.  To reduce bugginess, change any settings before starting your flight.  Accessing the ALT menu seems to reduce the amount of time you can fly before the game crashes.Alright, so the graphics are quite nice on this Simulator.  This makes for some nice immersion.  However, I'm getting into flying in the real world, and wanted to do some practice flights that I might actually fly to get a feel for them.  I enabled updating weather and everything.  (Highly recommend using the current weather settings)  Here's what would continually happen.  I would take off flying the piper cub, circle slowly to the correct heading and maintain my climb.  Finally I'd level off and settle in for a relaxing flight to a nearby lake.  Suddenly the Windows spinng wheel of loading pops up, and the game closes.  It says checking for problems, a fatal error has occured.  Restarting Microsoft Flight Simulator X.  After all that I'm staring blankly at the setting screen which has also lost the majority of my settings that I just customized.  Ok it's a fluke, let me try again.  After 5 attempts at this, and the game ""automatically restarting,"" I searched for similar occurances.  It seems this game has a good deal of bugs that just simply aren't fixed.  I'm so frustrated, that I may switch back over to GEFS (Google Earth Flight Simulator)  It runs on your browser and has ok graphics.  Oh, and it doesn't randomly crash.			"

												This game and I have had an extremely long relationship. Back when I had just turned 10 years old I saw a youtube video of a trike ultralight landing at a major airport in fsx and I thought to myself, it would be cool to do that. Then I quickly searched it up and came up with a sight where I could download the demo. At the time I was really into the show ""Flying Wild Alaska"" on the Discovery channel which was about pilots making a living flying in Alaska. So, as soon as I got in game my goal was to recreate the flights in the show. In the demo you got only a few planes a few airports and a few missions and it put you in TNCM which is near the equator so my hopes of recreating those flights were ruined... Or were they? After a while of messing about only using keyboard and mouse (and pausing the game every 3 seconds to make adjustments) I realised that this would probably be easier with a controller so I pulled out my Dad's old Microsoft Precision Pro (Best joystick ever nothing even comes close in my opinion) and found the USB adapter plugged it in and had a go. I quickly realised that it was so much easier to control with a joystick and my interest for the game only grew. After a while of searching on the internet I found a freeware website where I could get planes and scenery made by others and then I realized that I could recreate the flights in the show with those planes. I downloaded a bunch of single engined props and started messing with the weather to get the desired conditions. After an hour of having fun with that I realized 2 things 1: Demo limits your time 2: Some guages in freeware aircraft are missing. This kind of lowered my hopes as I thought I would have to pay hundreds for the full version but when I searched it on Amazon it was only $35 and It was close to my birthday so I made my parents get it. While waiting for FSX to arrive I came across the FSX film making communities on Youtube and fell in love with this video:

During the next 3000 hours spent on the boxed version of FSX I learned more and had more interactions with people with interesting perspectives and thoughts than I ever had in my real life. I went through multiple ""Phases"" while playing this game also like ""craving"": Pre-WWI aircraft, Biplanes with exposed radial engines, WWII aircraft, Turboprops, A2A only aircraft, etc. and all that research into those aircraft and such gave my more historical knowledge than I had ever learned in school. It also helped me gain the abilities to think logically and visually and to deeply understand certain workings of physics even though I had never studied them deeply before this game. This game is what brought me into PC gaming, kept me busy, educated me, and entertained me. Would HIGHLY reccomend  for anyone of any background of nearly any age to experiment and have fun in.			"

												Flight Simulator X is an older simulator, but is still perhaps one of the better flight simulators out there.  The realism is scalable, which makes it reasonably manageable for a beginner, and pretty realistic for the expert.  As a working commercial pilot in the real world, I have seen how this particular desktop simulator stacks up to even professional simulators.  Arguably, sometimes the realism in this simulator is (can be depending on how you customize it) comparable to even a Level-C simulator, although the latter has motion, and FSX of course does not.The amount of customization available for this sim is limitless.  There are hundreds if not thousands of different addons you can download to enhance your simming experience.  You can download addons that model certain aircraft down to every switch and every vibration in the cockpit.  If you want to tour the world, you literally have a representation of the whole globe within this piece of software.  If you are a real world pilot, and want to shoot approaches because you keep getting those CAVOK days, then have at it.  If you want to just mess around, then you have this option as well.If you are an aviation fanatic, than this is the sim for you.			"

												Quite realistic if you put the settings on hard. FSX doesn't give you freedom in the cockpit of your plane. Basically what I mean is that all the switches are limited to none but on the upside; the game is realistic. Real time flight. Real world weather (requires download databases on the internet). Great community members (most of them). It's recommended if you want to be a pilot but if your not... then it's not the game for you, or of you want realism 100% and total freedom. I recommend other games. Still... I rate 7/10.			"

												I used (and still have) the boxed FSX. I was disappointed to discover that the boxed version was very glitchy and buggy on Windows 8 and 8.1. Then I saw this on sale - £2.89!This works MUCH better than the boxed version. Now time for the pros and cons:PROS:• Less glitchy on newer systems• Fixed major bugs and applied common fixes (e.g. HIGHMEMFIX)• Ongoing support from DTG (Dovetail Games)• Steam forums• Add-ons available fom Steam• Most freeware and payware works• SALES!!!  • Steam Multiplayer*CONS:• Some 3rd party add-ons don't work• Might crash on older systems (e.g. Windows Vista, Windows XP, etc.)• ALWAYS requires an active internet connection to start the game. (DTG are going to make a workaround for this... hopefully sometime soon!)• NOT backwards compatible with FSX Boxed multiplayer sessions.All in all, this version of FSX is great for new systems and new hardware, but, if you don't mind the bugs, and all your friends have FSX boxed, you might want to get that and this so that you can play with them as well.*Not backwards compatible with FSX Boxed multiplayer sessions.

												Since it's pretty much the same as the original FSX, what could be wrong with it? It runs a bit smoother than the original, some say it's a lot smoother but I haven't noticed a huge difference. Maybe a maximum of 50% FPS increase in backcountry areas, but in big complex detailed cities such as Manhattan the FPS is still pretty low when we're talking about a high end computer and a 10-year-old game.But I still recommend it. The original was awesome, and this is the same but a bit smoother so obviously it's awesome too. If you already own the original FSX, I'd suggest you wait for a sale before buying this game though.

												Microsoft Flight Simulator has been and still remains the gold standard of flight simulation. This version has, remarkably, been around since 2006, but has worn amazingly well. While it gets stiff competition nowadays from Prepar3D and X-Plane in particular, it can still more than hold its own.For the purposes of this review, I am only going to concentrate on the default, ""out-of-the-box"" scenery and aircraft - in other words, what you first get when you buy this game. As is the case with P3D and X-Plane, there are numerous add-ons that can enhance the game enormously, but I think the fairest way to review a game like this is focus on what it comes with initially.One thing I really love about Microsoft Flight Simulator X (hereinafter: FSX) is the extent to which it teaches you about the basics of flying. Quite aside from tutorial missions, there is a section called the ""Learning Center"" which has an incredible wealth of information. There are detailed instructions about how to fly each of the default aircraft, for instance. Then too there is a tab in the ""Learning Center"" called ""Lessons"". This will give you highly detailed ""ground school"" articles by professional flight instructor Rod Machado, along with practical lessons guided by Rod. You will learn the fundamentals of taking off, landing, turning, stalls, VOR/DME/ADF navigation, ILS landings and so much more besides. You can also do checkrides and, if you pass them, get a certificate that will go into your ""Pilot Rewards"" (an unnecessary but fun component of FSX).""Boring,"" you may say. ""I want to fly, not study!"" Well, there's nothing stopping you from flying straight away if you want. (Indeed, I did.) But take it from me, repeatedly crashing because you have no clue about how to land a plane, or much of a clue about any aspect of flying, is not a lot of fun. Yes, it may take a bit of time to go through Rod Machado's lessons and study some of the other articles in the Learning Center, but it will enhance your experience of the sim enormously in the long run. And it is immensely satisfying when you apply what you have learned and begin to master new skills. FSX can, if you are willing to make the effort, train you in a way that its rival X-Plane will not. (I don't know about Prepar3D, so can't comment on how helpful or otherwise it is to flying and flight simming novices.)There are two main ways you can play FSX. The first is ""Free Flight"". With this mode, you can select an airport and simply take off from it to go wherever. Or you can file a proper flight plan and fly from one airport to the next. If you change your mind mid-flight, just open up the appropriate menu and file another flight plan. You get pretty much the whole world - including Antarctica - to fly in. You also get plenty of noteworthy landmarks to see.The other main playing mode is Missions. There is a great variety of different missions you can do, with difficulty levels ranging from ""Beginner"" to ""Expert"". Some of the missions seem a bit mis-classified though. Several of the ""Beginner"" lessons require some pretty advanced piloting skills, although you don't have to know about navigation or ATC interaction to fly them. In that sense, they are ""Beginner"" difficulty, but they're otherwise really hard. Other missions are more straightforward though. The missions are a good way to get acquainted with the different kinds of aircraft that FSX has to offer and see what types you like best (I discovered for instance that I really enjoy GA planes and airliners, but can take or leave helicopters and gliders aren't my scene at all). They are also a good way to challenge yourself in a variety of interesting situations. And if the default missions aren't to your liking or just aren't enough for you, there is no shortage of mission packs on offer (such as ""Cargo Crew"", ""Arctic Rescue"" and ""Dangerous Approaches"" available here on Steam). You get rewards for passing missions (nothing that special, just a ""sticker"" in your Pilot Records, but still, quite good fun).Actually, there is also a third mode: Multiplayer. However, I have never used that, so can't comment on how good or otherwise it is. All I will say is that it doubtless adds another dimension if you want to use it.Planning a flight couldn't get much easier in FSX. This process is very intuitive and easy to learn. I especially love the Navigation Log that is generated, and which you can refer to on your ""Kneeboard"" (press Shift + F10 for that) during a flight. Interacting with ATC is also very straightforward. The ATC window can be used to auto-tune your ""comms"" radio, although you can also quite easily tune radios manually if you want to do things more like a real pilot. Aircraft come with both 3D virtual cockpits and 2D panels. When you're in 2D mode, you can make mini-panels pop up (press Shift + 1, 2, 3 etc.) that give you access to things like the radio stack, throttle quadrant and overhead panel. Very handy, and saves a lot of fumbling around trying to find where things are.As seriously awesome as this game is however, it is not without its faults. The ""out-of-the-box"" scenery of instance is pretty blah. Cities - especially less well-known ones - are not very accurately rendered, and the textures are decidedly average. Topography is one area where X-Plane 10 beats FSX hands-down. However, there are plenty of add-ons to improve the scenery (I especially recommend Orbx's FTX products), and at least FSX gives you buildings at airports, which certainly can't be said for X-Plane in a lot of cases! In flight dynamics too, FSX can be a bit ho-hum, especially when it comes to helicopters. Taxiing can also be rather fiddly. The ""Pilot Records"" section is a bit of a mess. It would be nice if some real airlines were represented rather than just generic ones (although it's quite easy to add new liveries). And because FSX is so old, it is only capable of running in 32-bit mode, which means that it tends to struggle with more sophisticated add-ons. That said, there is a vast amount of add-ons out there, and you can do a tremendous amount to FSX without breaking it. But the more advanced computers become and the more sophisticated add-ons get, the more FSX will struggle in the future. For now though, it still works very well and there are so many great ways to enhance it. Steam alone offers a lot of great add-ons, but there are more to discover at places like The FlightSim Store or Just Flight. No shortage of freeware to be found either (check the AVSIM Library for instance).Another thing I sometimes struggle with is visibility. However, a neat trick I have discovered is to open a ""mini-window"" while in 2D panel mode and set this ""mini-window"" to Outside Spot view. This way, I can keep an eye on my instruments while being able to see easily to taxi or land. Best of both worlds!All in all, I recommend Microsoft Flight Simulator X very highly indeed. If you are new to flight simming and flying generally, as I was when I bought this game a little over a year ago, this game, with its Learning Center, will teach you a tremendous amount. It gives you a far better grounding in the basics of flying than X-Plane, which is really designed for people who already have a reasonable amount of experience. (Again, I don't know how novice-friendly or otherwise Prepar3D is.) And once you have grasped the fundamentals of flying, there is no end of fun to be had and discoveries to make. Be warned though that it is quite addictive once you master it (also the case with real flying, so I've heard), and while the basic game is very cheap (certainly a better deal initially than X-Plane or Prepar3D), your wallet can still suffer as you chase after add-ons to further fuel your virtual flying addiction. You may or may not be in love with flying (virtually or otherwise) now, but once you have played FSX, you will be!			"

												This is a really good game. Be aware there are many quality addons from sites other than steam. I really do recomend this game becuase 1 compared with old fsx it does not crash and 2 it is on steam. Please be aware that not all addons for fsx boxed edition work on FSX SE. Buy in sale if you have chance 3.99 bargin.DONT GET YOUR ADDONS FROM STEAM go to Just FlightA2A= Quality Aerosoft+many more			"

												In my opinion, this is an amazing game, but there are a few things that could change, in the future.1- Adding an AH-64D Apache2- Bell Huey3- B-29 Superfortress4- B-17 Stratosphere5- P-38 Lightning6- (add lots of helicopters, for available purchase, and available without purchase)If you really want to be a pilot, then this is the game for you!

												For its age, Microsoft Flight Simulator X is a good game. The new Steam Edition contains all expansion packs from the game before it came out on Steam, and once again, this is a very good, fun game. You have to be patient. There is definetley a learning curve. And yes, multiplayer functionality has been restored. If you practice, and are patient enough, you can really master this game. There are only a few aircraft, but dear god this game has so much modding capability. You can download free aircraft and hundreds of other things from various FSX websites, all easy to install. Or, you can invest a little money and get a payware aircraft, for example the PMDG 737-800, which are truly an experience to fly, and react just like the actual Boeing 737-800 would. To sum it up?BUY THIS GAME. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.			"

No reason not to update to a better copy of one of the greatest sims ever made.			"

												I had it on CD before. I bought this simulator game on steam to be able to access it from any computer. But as I discoverd the ''Connect Direct ''funktion has been disable or not working. This mean that I have to play multiplayer through steam which make it almost inpossible to play with others that take aviation seriously, you will not be able to use ATC correctly. People will just fly through other players and ATC towers. This sucks. If you are a hardcore simmer dont buy this flightsim on steam before they have fixed the 'Connect Direct' Funktion!			"

Posted: August 20, 2016
												I have been a Microsoft Flight Simulator enthusiast since inception, and my enjoyment for Flight Simulator has continued to grow as each release corrects bugs, makes improvemetns and provides opportunities for 3rd party support for add-ons.  The Steam Version has made several improvements while keeping the basic FSX concept intact but ignored the one factor that all users face and hate about the FSX franchise - the Out of Memory Error.2016 brings very powerful CPUs and GPUs to our disposal, and while my PC is at the top Tier in performance, Flight Simulator Steam Edition does not fully take advantage of this power due to FSX 32bit program structure.Many vendor's add-ons such as ORBX, Aereosoft, and even Steam DLC for Flight Simulator place greater demands on the finite 4GB Memory limits of Flight Simulator.  Thus when using the products with a fully capable aircraft cockpint simulator you will face the Out of Memory (OOM) issue at some point.  It could be 10 minutes into your flight, but more often than not it happens just as you approach that ""mega"" airport you paid $50.00 for  - resulting in a fatal error,  and the need to restart the program to begin again.The 4GB memory limit is the one thing that needs to be addressed more so than anything.  Otherwise it is pointless to buy highly detailed aircraft, scenery and airports then dial everything down to bare minimums to avoid running beyond the 4GB barrier causing a simulator crash.I use a tool called ProcessExplorer to monitor my memory usage during flights, and when the memory usage creeps up to 3.7gb I immediately save the flight because I know what is coming next - this is ridiculous. For everyones edification - Out Of Memory is not a ""physical"" memory limit but the restrictions of 32bit limits of the program itself, Memory caps out at 4gb regarless of how much physical memory you have installed. For consideration: Starting up the SIM at a detailed airport with an iFLY 747 you just used about 3.2 gb or Vmemory and as you fly, use the panel cockpit instruments and enjoy the views, the remaining memory will slowly be depleted until your sim crashes - OOM.Even if developers of this Steam Flight Simulator version produced a tool that automates saving the flight when memory is near the crash limits at least that would be a step in the right direction, but no tool is offered. I guess creating one would be admiting the problem exist and wise folks would avoid the 32bit  franchise all together.  The other issue with this version as in previous ones is Flight Simulator does not properly flush memory between flights, and with each session, the more you fly it too will deplete the 4gb limit eventually,  unless of course you restart the program and waits the 3 minutes for a re-load.Once again no in game ""memory flush"" feature for a long known issue.The one major limiting factor that needed to be fixed went answered: and companies are more than happy to sell you add-ons knowing their add-on products place added demands on the limited memory space of this 32bit program. Back when Aces was doing the development they would make a statement following each release, ""they intentionally build the simulator for the next generation of the PC"", WELL here we are, and my system can throw this around at 40+ fps BUT crashes because no one has taken time to address the 32bit limit.  the issue rapidly begain to manifeste  itselft once end users moved up to more powerful systems, and content creators offered ""better"" higher detailed planes, airports, and scenery.Moving forward: I would think offering a 64bit release would destroy compatibilty for all those add-ons, and this is the underlying reason the program remains 32bit, to keep the 3rd party suppliers happy more than the end user. My prediction is this simulator will simply be 32bit forever, and a NEW Flight Simulator will be offered, sold and we enthusist will venture out and buy it, and cough up money for basically the same add-ons to get us to this point in time to facilite the true enjoyment of flight simulation without the OOM crashes. as they say in contracting - you dont make money fixing it, sell them something new.So how do you avoid all this OOM stuff:  Stick to the basic Flight Simulator and Aircrafts, forgo any add-ons, or at least keep them to the bare minimum. Make your choice- Do you want to look at pretty scenery or have a simulator cockpit experience - with the limits of 32bit program it is difficult to have both.IMHO it would be best to stick with the basic FSX steam version with limited add-on purchases, and hope the next FXY version will be 64bit.So how do I like the Flight Simulator Steam Edition - I love it, due to the vast content one has access to, the realiasm, and landclass graphic details frim orbx that can be achieved using new improved land classes, and add-0n airports. but as stated, fatal program crashes will occur depending on your combonation of aircract, area, and detail level settings. With all the above being said.  Flight Simulator Steam Edition has plenty to offer with many hours of enjoyable game play for all flight simulator enthusiast. - buyer be Advised of the 232bit limits.			"

												One of the best simulation games out there, period. (I've more than 2000 hours in the original retail version of the game)It has been around for many years now but that shouldn't put you off. If you love flying, helicopters, planes or anything else remotely close to an airport you'll enjoy this game. There are many bugs in this game, it always had them. However, since this is the ""new"" Steam edition of the game things have changed and really annoying bugs have been removed. Missions are fun but can be frustrating when objectives don't get completed or specific locations are extremely close to buildings which seems to have invisible extended walls (bug or bad texture, who knows?) when you need to taxi close by.

I tried many optimization guide on the web and none works for me. My laptop isn't very powerful as it only got a AMD A10-5750m CPU, and Radeon 8670m GPU.

I got a good 50 fps, without any add-ons, and even after installing many add-ons such as ORBX, REX, and AI Traffics I still get around 40 fps, with occasional drop to 20 fps, when i'm flying near third party airport, with many AI Traffics.

												I was pleased to hear this game was coming to steam. I have had the boxed versions for many years, and logged many hours, but have not played it in a long while. Being a real pilot and instructor I reverted to Xplane for most of my simming, but was looking forward to FSX again once I heard that it was coming to steam. I downloaded it and popped it onto my laptop, it ran smooth and i was able to max out all the graphic settings and it worked fine. I took a quick flight in a couple of my old favorite planes and flew around abit and shot an approach. Ran great and looked just as how I remembered it. One thing that I like in Mircosoft vs. Xplane is the ATC system and it was working just as I remembered. Bottom line just Great Fun!!! and at the current hoiliday sale price it would be a crime to pass it up. I do prefer Xplane a little more, but they are both great and have slightly different advantages and disadvantages, I enjoy having both.FSX is just plain fun and runs great! I recommend it to anybody that likes airplanes, flying and aviation!  I am glad that I bought the game...........again!			"

												Out of the box the game isn't that good aircraft are very lacking in detail and in most of the switchis are their but have no function and some are just 2d textures even when the settings are turned up the texturs are extreamly lacking and the weather could do with an update, however this game is very old by todays standards and i expected more from the rather rip off price of £29.99 (thogh when it gose on sale it is normaly priced at about £5.99 a more resinable price for a game of this qualty).But if you inveast your time in finding and downloading some good mods it can be quite a good sim i spent a good few hours trauling the internet finding mods but now ive found my favorit setup ive found it to be quite nice and it was all free ( - the game cost)!Ovarall i think this game is good dor amutures and people getting into the hobbie of flight simulation althogh more expirenced simmers might want to look at flight sims like x plane 11.

												after all this time it is still a pain in the rear to setup your cockpit on multiple monitors and have it display correctly.  Why can no sim get this simple concept correct?  I have 6 monitors... 3 for scenery and 3 for the full cockpit dashboard.let us assign the screens and keep them that way every time we start the darned game!!!!EDIT 1: so I played around with it for longer.  The screens are still hard to get working right.  The DLC is too expensive. .... otherwise it's not so bad.  I still have not played with the ATC sim part or online play but the current issues with immersion are more important than playing with ATC controllers that may or may not know protocols.  Stay tuned.EDIT 2: Holy Mega-charge DLC! There's already 19 expansion packs all at asinine prices. Such a shame Microsoft sold this to such a POS company. I could see if expansions were a few dollars each or so, or had bundles... if you want to know where this game is headed just check out train simulator... hundreds of DLC's for about $4000+ USD. All for crappy content (but the only content that will work right in this buggy platform.) Don;t support this company, please. They take things that would be awesome for the community and put them squarely on the shelf of the few people stupid enough to shell out thousands of dollars for half-rear content.			"

												this is a nightmare to use. I can not get sound working at all, I had to do all kinds of work arounds to get trackIR and my HOTAS working. And, it is missing all the important settings you need to have a decent experience. This sim was not ready to be re-released. I assumed they at least made it compatible with modern controls and hardware, but they haven't. In it's current state I would not recommend this to anyone, unless you are using a 10 year old PC with a basic 1-plug joystic. The fact that it can't even play sound through my USB headset is absurd. Wish I never re-bought this, the disc version worked great back when it was new, this is just a huge dissapointment.			"

												If you nurse a secret ambition to be a pilot, this is a great game.  Very realistic, and there's loads of add-ons and hardware out on the market you can purchase to make it even more so.There's a serious bug in it, however, that ruins the whole thing, and there's enough people complaining online that I know it's a very common problem.  What's more, considering the number of years the franchise has been around and constantly upgraded, it's reallly inexcusable.  The game crashes, regularly.  When I first bought this game and installed it on my previous PC, it worked well enough at first, but then started to stop working after a period of time.  The more I played it, the more quickly it stopped working.  Finally, it would stop working within a few minutes of starting, and I'd be lucky even to get the airplane off the ground.I tried reinstalling it.  It made no difference.  So I quit playing it for a while.  After I'd bought a new PC, I installed the game again.  Again, for the first little while, it worked just fine.  Then the software started crashing.  And then the longer I played, the quicker it would stop working.  Rght now, the game will work for about 30 minutes, which is barely enough to take off, turn around and land again.I've hunted online for explanations and solutions.  Microsoft seem to have none.  Various forums contain posts saying, ""You need to install this link.""  Of course, you have no idea what you're downloading, or whether it contains a dozen virusses, and the reactions of other people on those forums don't suggest any of those links really make a difference.Given the years this franchise has been available, Microsoft really should be aware of this problem and ought to have solved it by now.  But while it's a great game, and lots of fun, I cannot recommend that people spend quite a lot of money for software that crashes inexplicably and without fail.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but after hours in menus and constant head aches I've finally decided to give up. The graphics are clearly dated, which isn't too much of an issue to me. What is, however, is the flight model. When I could get it working I never felt like I was actually flying a plane. In comparison to other current flight sims on steam I cannot see how MFS-X is honestly anything but a huge waste of money. Their add ons system is just absurd, even for flight sims. I under stand selling extras planes as dlc, thats okay. But ♥♥♥♥ing 3,000 in DLC and $25 for a ♥♥♥♥ing graphics update that was free a year ago, for an 11 year old game with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ flight model? No thanks. Do yourself a favor and Check out one of the IL-2 games (yes, even the oldest one, 1946, has a better flight model, graphics, and more planes, and its only like 5 bucks), or X-plane or DCS. They are all leaps and bounds ahead of this one. Unless you're a diehard MFS-x fan and don't have the steam edition yet, I strongly urge you to reconsider spending your money elsewhere.TL;DR: Don;t waste your money on this relic if you want a good flight sim			"

You can have even a quite old and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer and still this game runs well on right settings  (though you sometimes have to search them for a while). However, you can change the look of your sim with a variety of addons.The part you all have been waiting!ANCIENT SECRET FROM YEAR 2006 IS REVEALED!THE BEST PART OF FSX IS.......Addons! Yes. A whole lot of different addons. Planes, choppers, zeppelins, hot air balloons! For passenger, cargo, general aviation and military uses! Addons to affect simulator's outer  appearance, weather, airports and ATC!I recommend.(Also find group called Trolled By FSX, there's a lot of help for sim beginners)			"

												Just the same simulator i ""played"" for a while : FSX in the beginning and P3D later. The real innovation is the FPS that is really increased : even with a 3770k and a GTX980 the ""game"" was below 30 FPS (really high settings). Now this is really smooth and this is what  i wonder.Another great thing is the third party devs that continues to fix problems encounter by Win10 or FSX SE (or the both).if you are really interested in flight simulators and want to bring you more of what it is in real life you can not get away with aircraft included : there are many freeware , payware are much more realistic but cost a expensive than even the game itself ( Majestic DASH 8 or F1 ATR 72500 : about € 40 )			"

												Amazing Game! Realistic, great flight modelling and all the airports in the world! I couldn't reccomend this game more. It used to run on low graphics on my Dual Core, 2GB RAM PC! X-Plane can't even run at 30 on low graphics on my Quad-Core A-10, 8GB RAM, nVidia GT 520 (Note: I had this graphics card in the old computer which blew up!)This game is marvellous on my new computer. Running 60fps without any hassle on HIGH settings. Not VERY HIGH because to be quite honest, without freeware or payware that iproves graphics, I can't really see any difference. I rate this game: Graphics (on a semi-decent PC) - 9/10 | Gameplay (with or without joystick) - 9/10 | Flight Modelling and Physics - 10/10 | Numberof Planes to start with - 8/10 (you only get around 8 planes with 12 variations of liveries!)

FSX:SE works!Just to clarify that headline: I've had FSX (the original - not Steam Edition) for years and since W8 came out, FSX crashed all the time. And by all the time I mean litarally all the time. I could not make one short flight from airport to airport in Scandinavia without the game crashing. When FSX:SE (Steam Editidion) was released, I bought it to give it a try. Best decision in a long time! As of now I've had 8 hours without any chrashes or hickups. FSX:SE just works. 6 of the hours I've been flying aound was with the standard planes available in the simulator. 2 hours are with Aerosofts Airbus A320[en.shop.aerosoft.com] and even that works without any problems.Important: If you have the boxed version of FSX installed: uninstall it before installing this! I had some problems when I first tried the game with the boxed version installed on my computer.I love Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition! "

												GOT CLARIFICATION FROM DOVETAIL GAMES ABOUT THE SDK:Microsoft has now issued us with clarification on this matter. FSX: Steam Edition does not include a developer SDK and the focus for this release is to provide players with a stable standalone simulator which utilises the advantages of the Steam platform. If you wish to use the SDK it remains available in the boxed edition of FSX and all functionality will continue to work as it did prior to the release of FSX: Steam Edition. There are no plans to introduce a SDK to the Steam edition at this time.*****************************************************************************************************************The gold edition relaunch on steam after Gamespy got down. New desing on the launcher, steam friends showing on there. Multiplayer is good, it doesnt eat much connection, and does the job on GSM networking too. Ability to play as ATC or Pilot in multiplay is good plus. The King of Flight Simulation has gotten up from the grave, and is back bigger and much more evil than it was with addons, and works fine with old free software like PAX and other addons. Simulation is easy to understand, everybody can learn to fly a 747, or even little Cessna in no time!Graphics are not HQ++++ but there are not many Flight Simulations that can do even that without eating your graphics card alive, or heating your CPU over 1000C. FSX was success, and hopefully this re-release of FSX wakes Microsoft studios to new era.Only minus i give this game is the ability to play offline is not yet implemented, but becouse there are no CD-keys anymore, i understand this.Thank you for reading!- ED			"

												Graphics aren't the best. Voice chat isn't the best. What IS the best? Seven-year-old ATC's telling you to land your A321 on a runway where a 747 is currently skidding off the runway onto the beach at TNCM. That's what's good about this game -- it's just fun. It's not very realistic unless you want it to be (payware addons, VATSIM, etc.), so use it however you want. Either way, it's good fun for young children who saw it on YouTube and avid enthusiasts alike. Highly recommend.			"

Currently running FSX SE in DX10 mode with Steve's DX10 fixer. Right now there is only one addon I am waiting for to work properly... Active Sky Next. Hopefully coming soon.

												This Steam Edition:  Somehow it has re-kindled my passion for sim flying.  I have purchased just about every MS FS version since the Commodore 128 days.  I would purchase each new version hoping for the best, but I would never play it after installing it.  It never ran smooth enough thoughout the years for me to enjoy it.  Even my Gold boxed Accelleration version has just sat on the shelf for the last few years since I bought it.I knew I was in for a lot of frustration trying to get FSX to work.  I spent the last month trying to do so.  All the reading...reinstallations...everything seemed to go wrong.  Then a few days ago, I was able to configure a stable running game.  It has all been worth it.This game has the backing of people/players each with over 6 years of experience and dedication to the FSX community.  Almost all the issues I ran into have already been addressed and the solutions posted on the web somewhere.  It's just a matter of searching on the web for suggested solutions to almost any problem.  I don't know how to thank the entire flight sim community and Dovetail for their contributions to this hobby - and making it accessible to people like me for the first time in 20 years.   I never had the finacial ability to purchase the hardware to make this game run smoothly; however, hardware has surpassed the requirements of the game to the point that I have the game running well enough to meet my expectations.  And...I am really excited.I hope there are many others that give FSX:SE a try and are able to enjoy it.  I would love to see the flight sim genre return with the passion it once had in the 90's.  Oh Lord...let there be flight.			"

When FSX:SE (Steam Editidion) was released, I bought it to give it a try. Best decision in a long time! As of now I've had 8 hours without any chrashes or hickups. FSX:SE just works. 6 of the hours I've been flying aound was with the standard planes available in the simulator. 2 hours are with Aerosofts Airbus A320[en.shop.aerosoft.com] and even that works without any problems.Important: If you have the boxed version of FSX installed: uninstall it before installing this! I had some problems when I first tried the game with the boxed version installed on my computer.I love Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition! "

												GOT CLARIFICATION FROM DOVETAIL GAMES ABOUT THE SDK:Microsoft has now issued us with clarification on this matter. FSX: Steam Edition does not include a developer SDK and the focus for this release is to provide players with a stable standalone simulator which utilises the advantages of the Steam platform. If you wish to use the SDK it remains available in the boxed edition of FSX and all functionality will continue to work as it did prior to the release of FSX: Steam Edition. There are no plans to introduce a SDK to the Steam edition at this time.*****************************************************************************************************************The gold edition relaunch on steam after Gamespy got down. New desing on the launcher, steam friends showing on there. Multiplayer is good, it doesnt eat much connection, and does the job on GSM networking too. Ability to play as ATC or Pilot in multiplay is good plus. The King of Flight Simulation has gotten up from the grave, and is back bigger and much more evil than it was with addons, and works fine with old free software like PAX and other addons. Simulation is easy to understand, everybody can learn to fly a 747, or even little Cessna in no time!Graphics are not HQ++++ but there are not many Flight Simulations that can do even that without eating your graphics card alive, or heating your CPU over 1000C. FSX was success, and hopefully this re-release of FSX wakes Microsoft studios to new era.Only minus i give this game is the ability to play offline is not yet implemented, but becouse there are no CD-keys anymore, i understand this.Thank you for reading!- ED			"

												As far as a pick-it-up simulator goes, I still have a hard time suggesting any other Flight Simulator over this one. It comes with many planes and, unlike another simulator recently released, has an entire world full of airports. It's easy enough to find free airplanes online instead of paying $20 or more per plane, and as far as realism goes, it isn't that different for someone who isn't an aspiring or real pilot. I'm sure the hardcore among us (or those with normal vision who have the career available to them) could tell me all day what the differences are, but I myself don't care enough for that. There's a TON of flight help and learning tools available, and a ton of aspects about flying are picked apart and explained through missions and text reads through the Learning Center.Having said all that it has some issues. It crashes randomly, has atrocious graphics for this day and age (people saying they're better are probably playing on Ultra for the first time as Microsoft wouldn't allow the graphics to be updated), and the menus could really be streamlined especially for new comers, but if you're used to this game and want it in the glory of Steam connection and not have to pray to the gods Gamespy, you're probably willing to look over that. And what a glory the Steam multiplayer is, no longer do I get disconnected from Gamespy for blinking too hard! I still seem to disconnect from my friend's games after about an hour, but odd quirks to be expected for an old game like this. This game is a memory hog, seems to have some issues with certain graphics cards, and the outside camera is still as wonky as ever, but these are things you end up getting used to. The price and available features alone would make me suggest this over any other Flight Simulator out today, and I hope there's better things to come for this otherwise dead genre (really all I ask for is updated graphics so my eyes don't bleed on those beautiful splotches of square ground, and a cargo transport Euro Truck Simulator style).

												Glad to see FSX come to Steam. Scooped this up during the Holiday Sale (couldn't beat the price) despite already having the Gold Edition on disc. Working great on Win7 x64, addons are working great, and I've even taken to using my Xbox 360 controller over my old Logitech Wingman joystick just because of how much I'm loving being able to control my view with the right analog stick (as opposed to that old awkward hat switch on the joystick). Dovetail were quick to release their initial update patch fixing the lessons and other issues. Here's hoping they continue their effort of making it the best it can be. The whole world and all of its runways in one sim. Yessirree, cleared for takeoff, indeed.			"

												okay, so I have been using some version of MS Flight Simulator since 1984 when it was SubLogic's Flight Simulator II... fats forward 30 years, and I have been happily using my original copies of FSX Deluxe and Accelleration (both purchased in brick and mortar stores on their respective release dates)..I had long since weathered the fear of the community that supports this franchise falling apart after the closure of Aces (the developer at Microsoft Game Studios that made FSX)..  I laughed at the joke that was Microsoft Flight, and continued pouring countless hours and thousands of dollars into my humble hobby.. the came the announcement that Dovetail would be picking up the rights to sell FSX and it would be released on Steam...  at first, I thought ""well that is nice, maybe this thing isn't going to die after all.""  And so I have taken the plunge, and bought Steam Edition.. well, right off the word go, it was a hassle installing it beside my original boxed edition of the game, and so I went ahead and uninstalled the boxed edition, as I have my enormous library of add-ons stretched across 3 hard drives, and would have little to do i the way of reinstalling most of it, beyond some scenery library recompiles, and a couple of the payware aircraft with touchy DRM that would need fresh installs...  Here is where the trouble began... When FSX:SE runs, it is wonderfullyt smooth, and has little impact on my machine, exerting a modest 40-60% load on my CPU and 20-35% on the GPU and gracing me with 50-70FPS frame rates, but that is where the fun stops.. in the past week I have made a grand total of 2, yes just 2 landing.. out of 327 takeoffs at the time of this writing, the game has managed not to crash during a flight a grand total of TWICE.. now to give Dovetail a little credit, I have not contacted them directly for support, but in the discussion boards here are some very well known and respected developers in the 3rd party add-on community, and if they don't have answers (as it would professionally be in their interest, as well as Dovetail's) then Dovetail doesn't have answers either.. the 3rd Party add-ons are what made this franchise sustainable, and is the only thing that will keep it going, and if this game cannot currently run 3rd party add-ons without terrain.dll crashes and R6025 runtime errors then I think I'm going to have to go back to the boxed edition for a while...  I can only hope that Dovetail finds and corrects the problems quickly, but frankly this is an even worse release than the Battlefield 4 debacle from Electronic Arts.. Do I still recommend the game? Yes, as it is still the King of home based flight simulators.. but am I enthusiastic about it? no, not with the game as it currently stands, and hopefully Dovetailwill do a couple things: first of all, communicate with their customers.. all the rage on the discussion forums about the game not working will only scare potential customers away, so even if you have nothing to report, saying so makes it know that you do actually have a presence and are indeed working on it (especially important while people are screaming that the game doesn't work while you are still cranking out DLC titles), and second of all, communicate and work with the developers to find solutions.. just because you can't seem to figure out what is causing the crashes, maybe by giving the developer community an idea as to what you're looking at, they can find the solution in the process of making their products work on your platform..  this isn't a AAA release, the secrecy and cloak  & dagger nonsense isn't going to help anyone...

												This has been for many years the premier Flight simulation software for the flight Sim enthusiast. It has a massive user base that consistantly provide professional add ons and materiel for this no longer supported Micro$oft game.You can do a search online or go to one of the multitude of online web sites to find excellent mission packs, planes, scenery updates and utilities to really 3enhance your flying experience. Lets also not forget the hardware items that you can purchase to further increase realism of your flight sim experience.Now that the Simulation has been taken over by Steam®, the early DLC's have been a little more than repeat sales of old mission packs and flight plans. Hopefully in the near future they will be able to provide additions that the flight sim community really want.  It is early days yet.However, even the standard flight sim provided by Steam is fully functional and able to provide many hours of Sim time, training and fun if that's what you are after.  I recommend it to every one.			"

												I am not a pilot. I do like flying though.I saw this in the sale and couldn't really resist giving it a go, having had FS2000 many years ago.It does everything I want it to. It simulates flight, and it works! The tutorial missions were pretty useful, and while the ground textures don't specifically relate to the actual place you are flying, it's effective enough considering the majority of your time is spent at altitude.I bought a flightstick over the weekend too which works seamlessly with FSX (no more painful taxiing trying to do rudder control on the keyboard), and now I can cruise over North Korea to my hearts content. Bosh.			"

												Let me get straight to the point. I use Windows 8.1 so when I bought the boxed version of FSX it didn't turn out so well. It crashed all the time, low frame rates and lets just say it didn't suit my computer as its a very old game. After a while it went completely corrupt on my computer and I gave up all together. Then I bought X-plane 10 when it went on sale. It was alright. Then one day I saw FSX on sale for only £3.99 and thought to myself, hell I enjoyed FSX so much before so why not buy this and if it goes corrupt on me then its only just £3.99. Let me tell you one thing. It was the best decision I had made in a while. It took me about 35mins to download (its a big game around 10gb) and as soon as I put it on I could tell this was made for my computer. I have around 24 hours on it and never has it once crashed on me. The boxed version felt like it was made for a 10 year old computer but Dovetail have done a great job on this and now it works great on Windows 8.1. I even use the PMDG 737ngx on it and no crashes whatsoever. Downloadable content is bs but I don't really care about that not when there's so much 3rd party content out there. If you are hesitant to buy this after having a bad experience on the boxed version, especially if your on Windows 8/8.1, well be hesitant no more. Hopefully Dovetail will continue to work on this game and make it even better then it is now.			"

												Im on the fence about this game, i have done over 400 hours of in game flying with it and i use mulltiple addons like orbx ftx vector and global, rex, uk2000, aerosoft, and airport sceneries and im overall impressed with how it has worked but the part i dont like is the issues it has sometimes, i have tried to use fsrecorder, and fsuipc and both failed with a .dll error on launch so over all i think its a good game but not really worth the upgrade unless you really need multiplayer for steam because you will need to reinstall all your addons, however if you are buying this as your first copy, i definetely recommend you get this version for the multiplayer			"

												I bought FSX-SE on 24 of December 2014 because Steam sold it for a promocional price. I already owned FSX and FSX accelleration for some years. I wanted to see for my self if it was true what Steam wrote about the performance of the re-compiled FSX for Steam Edition. Until now I am very positive about the performance of FSX-SE. I also installed various add-on aircraft which I bought before for FSX and also ""Mega Airport Lisbon 2008"" scenery for FSX that I bought more than a year ago from Aerosoft. After following some good advices on Steam community as well as on internet, I now have these add-ons as well as FSUIPC4 and IVAO Ivap modules ""up and running"" within FSX-SE. I run FSX-SE in Windowed mode because I use three monitors. The middle monitor is in use for FSX-SE. The left for Navigation charts (usually within the Navigraph Maps app). On the monitor on the right I have usually Flightsim Commander (9.6) and Google Chrome Webbrowser with the IVAO WebEye page. Since XMAS 2014 I have flown various hours online on IVAO without any crashes of the apps. Before, when using MS FSX I had problems with frequent crashes of FSX and/or add-ons. All together: I am very satisfied with FSX Steam Edition. I recommand FSX Steam Edition it to you as I experienced it as a good maintenance version of FSX. I hope that Steam will go on for long time supporting and expanding FSX for Steam Edition. I don't know if I am able to but I want to upload some screenshots I made from an online flight with FSX-SE that I made yesterday. Paul (IVAO VID 177181).			"

												It might still be a bit early for a review I think, But will still do this one based on the hours played so far.With my current system, I have seen less crashes with higher settings then the boxed version. I do run some addons that are freebies and after 5 hours or so I get the crash 99% of the time only because of the manual crew addon I have ( pressing a button to play a crew announcment ). Altho I have wanted to see actual people unloading my plane and people moving about as I have seen in videos. My current vid card supports shader 5.0 and the game says must support 2.0, and DX 10 mine handles DX 11. Now that still can be my vid card itself and my system configurations ( still working and testing those settings ) I did add the freeware and demo of Orbx ( the free airports and 2 ground stuff ) no issues at all with them.It is very nice to see that Dove Tail added some different planes / choppers to the mix vs the box version. And as I have ""only read"" fixing issues with windows 8 that the boxed version won't ever do. Something I have seen all over the reviews and forums is people saying 1 they crash all the time still and you can't play off line.The off line part yes would be nice to see them fix that for those that lose internet I have always been a hater to places like Steam for that one reason. I have lost my internet before and wanted to play a game I have been working on and can't because of no net connecton to verify. ( I haven't tried steam yet on this one... but I have another one that I can log in launch the game disconnet from the net play and exit and relaunch without the net connected like it stores the verifcation after first launch.) But off that rant lolCrashing durring play all the time well that can be tons of reasons with both gamer machines and store bought.As a RL computer person for many years here would be my questons for themWhat kind of comp are you using? do you have on board or extended graphics? how much stuff do you have running while playing ( that eats up resources )? In steams case how fast is your net connection? and have you tried game boosters?The number one thing I have come across over the years of the Internet is that people don't know how to properly clean thier computers. Computers I have come across have stuff running in the background and stuff you are unaware of that is distroying your system / internets performance. Along with programs running that are not needed during play. My ram ( 4 gigs ) runs with nothing open ( idle) at 13% and cpu is 0-5% right now having steams client open to do this review my ram is at 22% and cpu is 13% when I launch FSX either boxed or steam my ram goes to 44-56% and cpu 50-85% depending on what  graphics are loading. Without a game booster.Please don't take all that as being a smart butt or anything just trying to give people ideas of what could cause their issues. And I'm sure there will be people saying I'm wrong but we all have our opinion and experence.Hope my opinions and comments help people out.I give FSX - Steam 4 out of 5 stars after 22.9 hours played			"

												I've been using Flight Simulator on and off since it was first released in the 80's. I recently built a new rig with Windows 8.1 and installed my boxed FSX Deluxe edition from scratch with all my add-ons. I kept getting CTD's however which I couldn't stop even with everything stripped away so I gave up. Then I saw that a Steam Edition had been released with the Acceleration pack and which was also rumoured to have been optimised for modern operating systems and hardware.Anyway, I stripped off the old FSX and installed Steam Edition and there are no more CTD's. It seems very smooth, even sitting in a PMDG 777 at a busy airport with lots of traffic. My old rig used to chug along at about 12fps but the new one is jammed at a limited 30fps (NVidia inspector setting).Whether it's my new rig (i5 750 to i5 4690K) or whether it's the Steam addition making the improvement in performance, I couldn't say, but I'm a happy bunny either way.There is also the possibility that more 'improvements' might be made to the code (within the bounds of DTG's license with Microsoft.)This is less than half the price of some of my add-ons so I'd recommend it to anyone setting up a new rig or having reliability problems with their current setup.

												Thank you STEAM for hosting this simulator.I've been using this sim for years. It just keeps getting better.  Awesome views, modeling and game play. What a great way to relax and take in the sights. Fly from anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world. Many full HD destinations. Fly the stock planes or hundreds of aftermarket HD aircraft. Built in ATC or host your own ATC. The muliplayer play is perfect. You can fly with a simple setup or a multi-monitor full blown flight beast station.I would recommend this sim to everyone.  For all ages. A 10+ out of 10.Check out my page. http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014036486/screenshots/Again, thank you Steam.JayP.S. Check out my pictures in my profile. Enjoy.			"

												[Old review deleted cause it sucked]New Review:Here's the thing about my updated review. I recently finished building my gaming PC, which is a million times better than my old PC (specs below). On my old PC, the game looked like what it is... An MSoft game from 2006. On my new PC, it actually looks like a REAL GAME.Keep in mind while reading this that I purchased graphics enhancing DLC's.The textures for the ground, water, and buildings is very realistic. This is probably because I purchased the HD Textures and Airports DLC, but still. This game was originally released in '06. With graphics maxed out, it feels like you can ""see"" for miles. It's hard to believe 06 PC's could run this. Yeah, that's how good *most* of the graphics are. You occasionaly get texture errors, or tearing, when a building was placed inside another during development. Other than that, graphics look amazing, especially during dawn or dusk.The default aircraft are the originals from 2006. I didn't play the game back then, but I feel like the new devs may have improved them... The DLC's are decent, but my friends and I have experienced lots of crashing using the DLC aircraft. Animations and 3D cockpit on the inside look great no matter what you choose (other than the B747).If you want to buy this game and have it look good,  you're going to want a decent computer (see both my systems below). On my old one, the game performed like crap and looked like slightly less worse crap. My new system runs it at a steady average of 135 fps at maxed out graphics settings and 90% AI.Should you get this game? If you want a campaign, no. If you dream of being a pilot, or are one already, yes. If you want to crash fighter jets into cruise ships, definitely. Best of all, if you want to do group flights with friends, absolutely buy this game.Thanks for reading :)Old PC:Intel Core2 Duo E6550Cheap Dell motherboardGeForce GT 730 (awful, I know)8GB DDR2 RAM (cringe)New PC:Intel i7-6700k OC'd at 4.20 GhzAsus Z170-e motherboardEVGA GTX 950 SSC16GB DDR4 RAMThat alone should convince you to buy it.

												As a player of standard FSX for a few months, I decided to invest 10 pounds into this ""updated"" version of FSX. However, I have a few positives and negatives to discuss;POSITIVES-Runs smoother-Doesn't hog the CPU as near as much any more which allows the game to utilize your graphics card more.-The extra missions/aircraft-Steam Multiplayer :)-Game feels a little more polishedNEGATIVES-To host a multiplayer game, you need to port forward-Not all addons are compatibleOverall, I think that this release is a positive sign but I won't be switching totally from normal FSX just yet.

												Two words: Buy Now!  100% More-than-satisfied.  I've had this game for years when the multiplayer was through GameSpy (long since disconnected) and was very disappointed when the multiplayer support closed.  MANY thanks to Steam for reviving this ""Great"" game.New flight simulators have been released since this program's release in 2006, but this is sill without-a-doubt the most comprehensive, realistic, customizable, and fun flight simulator through 03/2015.  There are also MANY websites that store mods for this game, just search and see what you can find!  Quality control of 3rd-party downloads is up to you though because there really is so much content ranging from airport layout and texture fixes to weather and surface vehicle customizations that noone could possibly check it all.  You can find aircraft as professionally made as the defaults, to crazy craft that defy every law of physics, (made to fit SciFi movies and TV shows of course!) ;-)This program helped fuel my passion for flying from the beginning, and I'm now a Certified Flight Instructor in Louisiana, USA.  Another real-life note, some flight training centers that have simulators capable of being used for actual logbook time have used this program.  Like I said, this ""Game"" is thorough and realistic (unless you fiddle with the settings alot.) ;-)			"

After a long day at the airport, I love how I can come home, sit on my desk, and start living a dream of mine, to be a pilot. Once the bugs are fixed with some of my payware stuff, this will be my top favorite Steam game, so get cracking, Dovetail! Thank you for bringing Flight Simulator X into a more stable system!			"

												Nice game, quite suitable for simmers-beginners right ""from the box"" (good tutorial and manual, simple stock planes, helpful 2-nd pilot in missions). Of course there is a lot of space for hard-core players through the use of third-party addons. Unfortunately there are still many bugs in missions, sceneries, stock plane cockpits and so on. I believe that they'll get fixed by 10-th anniversary. :-)			"

												I bought FSX-SE on 24 of December 2014 because Steam sold it for a promocional price. I already owned FSX and FSX accelleration for some years. I wanted to see for my self if it was true what Steam wrote about the performance of the re-compiled FSX for Steam Edition. Until now I am very positive about the performance of FSX-SE. I also installed various add-on aircraft which I bought before for FSX and also ""Mega Airport Lisbon 2008"" scenery for FSX that I bought more than a year ago from Aerosoft. After following some good advices on Steam community as well as on internet, I now have these add-ons as well as FSUIPC4 and IVAO Ivap modules ""up and running"" within FSX-SE. I run FSX-SE in Windowed mode because I use three monitors. The middle monitor is in use for FSX-SE. The left for Navigation charts (usually within the Navigraph Maps app). On the monitor on the right I have usually Flightsim Commander (9.6) and Google Chrome Webbrowser with the IVAO WebEye page. Since XMAS 2014 I have flown various hours online on IVAO without any crashes of the apps. Before, when using MS FSX I had problems with frequent crashes of FSX and/or add-ons. All together: I am very satisfied with FSX Steam Edition. I recommand FSX Steam Edition it to you as I experienced it as a good maintenance version of FSX. I hope that Steam will go on for long time supporting and expanding FSX for Steam Edition. I don't know if I am able to but I want to upload some screenshots I made from an online flight with FSX-SE that I made yesterday. Paul (IVAO VID 177181).			"

												It might still be a bit early for a review I think, But will still do this one based on the hours played so far.With my current system, I have seen less crashes with higher settings then the boxed version. I do run some addons that are freebies and after 5 hours or so I get the crash 99% of the time only because of the manual crew addon I have ( pressing a button to play a crew announcment ). Altho I have wanted to see actual people unloading my plane and people moving about as I have seen in videos. My current vid card supports shader 5.0 and the game says must support 2.0, and DX 10 mine handles DX 11. Now that still can be my vid card itself and my system configurations ( still working and testing those settings ) I did add the freeware and demo of Orbx ( the free airports and 2 ground stuff ) no issues at all with them.It is very nice to see that Dove Tail added some different planes / choppers to the mix vs the box version. And as I have ""only read"" fixing issues with windows 8 that the boxed version won't ever do. Something I have seen all over the reviews and forums is people saying 1 they crash all the time still and you can't play off line.The off line part yes would be nice to see them fix that for those that lose internet I have always been a hater to places like Steam for that one reason. I have lost my internet before and wanted to play a game I have been working on and can't because of no net connecton to verify. ( I haven't tried steam yet on this one... but I have another one that I can log in launch the game disconnet from the net play and exit and relaunch without the net connected like it stores the verifcation after first launch.) But off that rant lolCrashing durring play all the time well that can be tons of reasons with both gamer machines and store bought.As a RL computer person for many years here would be my questons for themWhat kind of comp are you using? do you have on board or extended graphics? how much stuff do you have running while playing ( that eats up resources )? In steams case how fast is your net connection? and have you tried game boosters?The number one thing I have come across over the years of the Internet is that people don't know how to properly clean thier computers. Computers I have come across have stuff running in the background and stuff you are unaware of that is distroying your system / internets performance. Along with programs running that are not needed during play. My ram ( 4 gigs ) runs with nothing open ( idle) at 13% and cpu is 0-5% right now having steams client open to do this review my ram is at 22% and cpu is 13% when I launch FSX either boxed or steam my ram goes to 44-56% and cpu 50-85% depending on what  graphics are loading. Without a game booster.Please don't take all that as being a smart butt or anything just trying to give people ideas of what could cause their issues. And I'm sure there will be people saying I'm wrong but we all have our opinion and experence.Hope my opinions and comments help people out.I give FSX - Steam 4 out of 5 stars after 22.9 hours played			"

Currently running FSX SE in DX10 mode with Steve's DX10 fixer. Right now there is only one addon I am waiting for to work properly... Active Sky Next. Hopefully coming soon. Noticed that I can run ""sliders"" higher, or higher configs in the .cfg file than before.			"

												This Steam Edition:  Somehow it has re-kindled my passion for sim flying.  I have purchased just about every MS FS version since the Commodore 128 days.  I would purchase each new version hoping for the best, but I would never play it after installing it.  It never ran smooth enough thoughout the years for me to enjoy it.  Even my Gold boxed Accelleration version has just sat on the shelf for the last few years since I bought it.I knew I was in for a lot of frustration trying to get FSX to work.  I spent the last month trying to do so.  All the reading...reinstallations...everything seemed to go wrong.  Then a few days ago, I was able to configure a stable running game.  It has all been worth it.This game has the backing of people/players each with over 6 years of experience and dedication to the FSX community.  Almost all the issues I ran into have already been addressed and the solutions posted on the web somewhere.  It's just a matter of searching on the web for suggested solutions to almost any problem.  I don't know how to thank the entire flight sim community and Dovetail for their contributions to this hobby - and making it accessible to people like me for the first time in 20 years.   I never had the finacial ability to purchase the hardware to make this game run smoothly; however, hardware has surpassed the requirements of the game to the point that I have the game running well enough to meet my expectations.  And...I am really excited.I hope there are many others that give FSX:SE a try and are able to enjoy it.  I would love to see the flight sim genre return with the passion it once had in the 90's.  Oh Lord...let there be flight.			"

												This has a great concept and is really realistic. However, I would only reccomend this if you're already rather experienced with aircrafts. For complete beginners like me, this simulator is nothing short of frustrating. The lack of explaination of where the panels are and what they do does not help at all when you're in mid-air still figuring out your plane. The missions also constantly throw you from one aircraft to another and you're always left to pick up the pieces  and find things out on your own and most of the time it doesn't work. I have heard so much great things about FSX and really want to like it but the learning curve and style of having confusing controls means that I've likely wasteed $25.In short: Great for people who are knowledgeble about aircrafts. Hell for beginners.			"

												This is a re-release of the ""Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Gold Edition"" (so the Acceleration Addon is included). The company fixed some issues and added necessary functionality for multiplayer support (adding Steamworks and remove the old multiplayer GameSpy). The language is English only and we can not expect any major changes in the future. But the representatives of Dovetail Games were very honest with that fact in the FAQ section inside the forums [1, 2, 3]. I really appreciate that. A big plus. In general this company seems to show a great presence on the forums which is a good support.The game works well and there is nothing wrong to buy this game. Even if you already have the retail version (5 € is not that much).You can digitize the gameIt has Steamworks multiplayer - I guess the multiplayer experience will increase a lot in future.[1] http://steamcommunity.com/app/314160/discussions/1/626329820730423515/[2] http://steamcommunity.com/app/314160/discussions/1/626329820730080279/[3] http://steamcommunity.com/app/314160/discussions/1/626329820729615790/ "

												This is an amazing game. Although the Graphics in it may not be the best quality, you've got to remember that the origninal game is something like  6 years old now.The gameplay though is unbeatable. The number of things you can do is incredible. The biggest downside is the cost of DLCs for Microsoft Flight Simulator X.			"

												I bought FSX-SE on 24 of December 2014 because Steam sold it for a promocional price. I already owned FSX and FSX accelleration for some years. I wanted to see for my self if it was true what Steam wrote about the performance of the re-compiled FSX for Steam Edition. Until now I am very positive about the performance of FSX-SE. I also installed various add-on aircraft which I bought before for FSX and also ""Mega Airport Lisbon 2008"" scenery for FSX that I bought more than a year ago from Aerosoft. After following some good advices on Steam community as well as on internet, I now have these add-ons as well as FSUIPC4 and IVAO Ivap modules ""up and running"" within FSX-SE. I run FSX-SE in Windowed mode because I use three monitors. The middle monitor is in use for FSX-SE. The left for Navigation charts (usually within the Navigraph Maps app). On the monitor on the right I have usually Flightsim Commander (9.6) and Google Chrome Webbrowser with the IVAO WebEye page. Since XMAS 2014 I have flown various hours online on IVAO without any crashes of the apps. Before, when using MS FSX I had problems with frequent crashes of FSX and/or add-ons. All together: I am very satisfied with FSX Steam Edition. I recommand FSX Steam Edition it to you as I experienced it as a good maintenance version of FSX. I hope that Steam will go on for long time supporting and expanding FSX for Steam Edition. I don't know if I am able to but I want to upload some screenshots I made from an online flight with FSX-SE that I made yesterday. Paul (IVAO VID 177181).			"

												It might still be a bit early for a review I think, But will still do this one based on the hours played so far.With my current system, I have seen less crashes with higher settings then the boxed version. I do run some addons that are freebies and after 5 hours or so I get the crash 99% of the time only because of the manual crew addon I have ( pressing a button to play a crew announcment ). Altho I have wanted to see actual people unloading my plane and people moving about as I have seen in videos. My current vid card supports shader 5.0 and the game says must support 2.0, and DX 10 mine handles DX 11. Now that still can be my vid card itself and my system configurations ( still working and testing those settings ) I did add the freeware and demo of Orbx ( the free airports and 2 ground stuff ) no issues at all with them.It is very nice to see that Dove Tail added some different planes / choppers to the mix vs the box version. And as I have ""only read"" fixing issues with windows 8 that the boxed version won't ever do. Something I have seen all over the reviews and forums is people saying 1 they crash all the time still and you can't play off line.The off line part yes would be nice to see them fix that for those that lose internet I have always been a hater to places like Steam for that one reason. I have lost my internet before and wanted to play a game I have been working on and can't because of no net connecton to verify. ( I haven't tried steam yet on this one... but I have another one that I can log in launch the game disconnet from the net play and exit and relaunch without the net connected like it stores the verifcation after first launch.) But off that rant lolCrashing durring play all the time well that can be tons of reasons with both gamer machines and store bought.As a RL computer person for many years here would be my questons for themWhat kind of comp are you using? do you have on board or extended graphics? how much stuff do you have running while playing ( that eats up resources )? In steams case how fast is your net connection? and have you tried game boosters?The number one thing I have come across over the years of the Internet is that people don't know how to properly clean thier computers. Computers I have come across have stuff running in the background and stuff you are unaware of that is distroying your system / internets performance. Along with programs running that are not needed during play. My ram ( 4 gigs ) runs with nothing open ( idle) at 13% and cpu is 0-5% right now having steams client open to do this review my ram is at 22% and cpu is 13% when I launch FSX either boxed or steam my ram goes to 44-56% and cpu 50-85% depending on what  graphics are loading. Without a game booster.Please don't take all that as being a smart butt or anything just trying to give people ideas of what could cause their issues. And I'm sure there will be people saying I'm wrong but we all have our opinion and experence.Hope my opinions and comments help people out.I give FSX - Steam 4 out of 5 stars after 22.9 hours played			"

Decided to install FSX SE tonight (just to try it out), and MAAAAN is it smooth. Basically, I'm migrating all my stuff from my old FSX setup right now. Currently running FSX SE in DX10 mode with Steve's DX10 fixer. Right now there is only one addon I am waiting for to work properly... Active Sky Next. Hopefully coming soon. Noticed that I can run ""sliders"" higher, or higher configs in the .cfg file than before.			"

												This Steam Edition:  Somehow it has re-kindled my passion for sim flying.  I have purchased just about every MS FS version since the Commodore 128 days.  I would purchase each new version hoping for the best, but I would never play it after installing it.  It never ran smooth enough thoughout the years for me to enjoy it.  Even my Gold boxed Accelleration version has just sat on the shelf for the last few years since I bought it.I knew I was in for a lot of frustration trying to get FSX to work.  I spent the last month trying to do so.  All the reading...reinstallations...everything seemed to go wrong.  Then a few days ago, I was able to configure a stable running game.  It has all been worth it.This game has the backing of people/players each with over 6 years of experience and dedication to the FSX community.  Almost all the issues I ran into have already been addressed and the solutions posted on the web somewhere.  It's just a matter of searching on the web for suggested solutions to almost any problem.  I don't know how to thank the entire flight sim community and Dovetail for their contributions to this hobby - and making it accessible to people like me for the first time in 20 years.   I never had the finacial ability to purchase the hardware to make this game run smoothly; however, hardware has surpassed the requirements of the game to the point that I have the game running well enough to meet my expectations.  And...I am really excited.I hope there are many others that give FSX:SE a try and are able to enjoy it.  I would love to see the flight sim genre return with the passion it once had in the 90's.  Oh Lord...let there be flight.			"

												This is a re-release of the ""Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Gold Edition"" (so the Acceleration Addon is included). The company fixed some issues and added necessary functionality for multiplayer support (adding Steamworks and remove the old multiplayer GameSpy). The language is English only and we can not expect any major changes in the future. But the representatives of Dovetail Games were very honest with that fact in the FAQ section inside the forums [1, 2, 3]. I really appreciate that. A big plus. In general this company seems to show a great presence on the forums which is a good support.The game works well and there is nothing wrong to buy this game. Even if you already have the retail version (5 € is not that much).You can digitize the gameIt has Steamworks multiplayer - I guess the multiplayer experience will increase a lot in future.[1] http://steamcommunity.com/app/314160/discussions/1/626329820730423515/[2] http://steamcommunity.com/app/314160/discussions/1/626329820730080279/[3] http://steamcommunity.com/app/314160/discussions/1/626329820729615790/ "

												Dovetail is killing FSX!One of the most important things in FS franchise is the support to 3rd parties developers, being partner of the publisher or not. At this point Dovetail is commiting a huge mistake and punishing their costumers:1 - PMDG: Aparently the new code disabled their products with a porpouse, once Dovetail rapidly contacted them to offer their softwares in its platform, as can be seeing at AVSIM, but PMDG refused this and discovered a way to implement their aircrafts (777 is available now).2 - SDK was killed, almost limited to older versions of SimConnect.3 - Some 3rd parties products that once worked fine with FSX SE now are having troubles.4 - All links are removed without notice and reason! For the most experienced people it's not a big deal, but for new costumers it is. There is a large number of addons, even freeware, available in so many websites, but due to ""automatic delete links"" policy we can't show them. Avsim, Terra-Brasilis, Aerosoft, PMDG, OPUS Software, FSXfreewarelist, Opensky Project... I will not post the links because they will be deleted, but you can google it.5 - The DLC's contains, basically, missions that provides flight plans, even freeware aircrafts were offered with charge. REALLY? Don't byu this craps! You can enter at Sky Vector or Flight Aware and make yourself awsome and personalized flight plans!6 - Don't run in offline mode? Why? Are you spying us?			"

												very well optimized, runs smoothly on low spec notebok, 40-60 fps, if you don't want to buy a joystick you can use monect for ios and android, you can make a template with sliders for throttle and the rudder, and control the yoke with the phone's sensor, and of course add a few buttons for whatever you think you need to have in hand or use the keyboard for that. i tell you, for aircrafts like cessna 172 and similar, whatever aircraft that has yoke, monect has nothing to envy to those stick joystiks, it's super realistic once you setup the sensitivity correctly, you can move your phone in any way and the yoke will move EXACTLY as you positioned your phone. now, for sidestick types, buying a stick joystick will be the most realistic, and i say this just because of the feeling and the real hardware you would be touching on a real aircraft, since as i said, using monect for controling the plane its super nice, i can't say enough here, this just doesn't make justice, you must try it yourself, happy flying!

												Reich's Opinionated Review: Don't listen to me, listen to the people who actually review it.Well, well, well, Flight Simulator X or 10 or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want to call it is one of my guilty pleasures, So I thought ""hey steam has it now"" I decided to buy it to see what the DLC-♥♥♥♥wits (Dovetail Games) have decided to do with it. So, Microsoft Flight Simulator X on steam improved absolutely ♥♥♥♥-all! The only difference is all the DLC that dovetail pile onto every game they endorse! But like the antidisestablishmentarianist I am, I bought it because there's something enjoyable about flying a big metal box with rockets strapped to it over the ocean then trying to get it back down again. I don't know why it's fun, it just is, the same can be said for masturbation.- Reich			"

												To be honest I want to say this game simulator is sometimes quite frustrating. Well that's all about the bad stuff!FSX offers a lot of possibilities. You can have even a quite old and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer and still this game runs well on right settings  (though you sometimes have to search them for a while). However, you can change the look of your sim with a variety of addons.The part you all have been waiting!ANCIENT SECRET FROM YEAR 2006 IS REVEALED!THE BEST PART OF FSX IS.......Addons! Yes. A whole lot of different addons. Planes, choppers, zeppelins, hot air balloons! For passenger, cargo, general aviation and military uses! Addons to affect simulator's outer  appearance, weather, airports and ATC!I recommend.(Also find group called Trolled By FSX, there's a lot of help for sim beginners)			"

												Bought this a few months ago and have to say its not a dissapointment at all.The base game may look below standards today, but you have to remember its coming onto 10 years old. However there are plently of various add ons that change that. Since buying this I have bought several add ons and though some are a tad expensive, the change to the sim are worth it.There is quite a steep learning curve, especially if you decide to get one of the advanced aircraft. But its had to beat nailing a landing in bad weather :)The only downside to it is the fact that its showing its age and cannot use modern PC's to the full. I have had several instances of ""Out of memory"" errors when trying to run everything on ""High"". Other than that, if you like flight sims and you dont mind a challenge, go for it.Add ons-PMDG 737 NGX-PMDG 777-Aerosoft Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321-Alabeo DA42 TS-Carenado Phenom 100-Active Sky Next-ORBX Global-ORBX NI, England, Ireland-Uk 2000 Belfast Int, Heathrow, Manchester, Edinburgh, Luton, Jersey, Gatwick-Fly Tampa Dubai-Taxi2Gate Munich-Precipit FX (PMDG 737)-737 Immersion-Rex 4 Texture Direct with Soft Clouds-GSX-EzDok-FS2Crew (PMDG 737)			"

												I have been flying the boxed version of FSX since about 2006. I have invested waaaayyyy too much money on add ons...DX10 FIXER, ORBX, A2A, CARENADO Planes, Vertigo Planes, UTX, FSPassengers, FSFLYING SCHOOL, REX, ACTIVE SKY NEXT....I was really leary of the claims that the Steam version was better than what I had achieved with a decent I7 950 @3 GHZ, NVIDIA GTX 770, 24 Gbs of ram machine. I was getting about 20-30 FPS...which is often meaningless...I sought smooth flying. Matt Davies's config simplification and NVIDIA inpspector config helped a lot. However, upgrading this week to the FSX Steam edition has been amazing. I have never seen FSX so smooth...Friday harbor in nasty winter fog and rain runs smooth. Seattle runs smooth. I am amazed at what Dovetail did. THANK YOU!			"

												One of the best flight simulaters I've played, before I played X-Plane9, it was a long time ago but I didn't like it very much, yet for me there is one  issue with the game. I download aircrafts from Simviation, yet any POSKY aircraft that I ever downloaded (mostly 747,767,777) had non functional front gear, it doesn't rotate at all, except for this issues I really recommned the game.

												The game itself is pretty awesome, the graphics are amazing, doesnt make me lag at all. The only thing really bad about this is it lacks a good selection of aircraft, Ive flown every single one and kinda got bored of em, so I dont play as much as I used to. Other than that, great game!			"

												The best 'game' I've ever played. Even though it originally came out in 2006, Flight Simulation X still holds up as a truly amazing simulator.   The Steam Edition has made improvements to the performance.The base simulator covers the entire globe, has flying lessons built in and also many missions to complete. A word of warning though, if you end up getting into flight simulation, it may end up costing you a lot more as there are some amazing addons to pick up. I'm a photoscenery fan, as I like to know that what I'm flying over is an exact replica of what I would see if I was really flying.  Plus it can be used to navigate accurately.If you're new to flight simulation, here are my recommendations, bearing in mind I'm a GA flyer: Firstly, buy the book FSX for Pilots- Real World Training.  It is the perfect way to learn how to fly using the simulator. Essential Addons:General:REXFS Global (preferably ultimate editions)Natural Tree Environment X - not essential but I like it.Accu-Feel - Makes the default planes feel more realistic.If you're not into photoscenery:FTX GlobalFTX VectorIf you prefer photoscenery, then it might not be worth getting the two FTX products, as your photo scenery will overwrite themUK Photoscenery: VFR Generation X v3Revolution X ( a criticism levelled at photoscenery, is that they can appear flat, however this adds loads of autogen andis fantastic).UK2000 UK airportsThese titles are amazing.  So realistic.USA PhotosceneryMegascenery EarthTreeLines (like Revolution X, but only includes trees.  Works well though)Night Environment for each state where available.Airplanes:The default ones are ok, but there are better ones out there.  For GA flying I love the A2A Piper. Traffic:  Ultimate Traffic 2 is a good one.  Makes things a lot more interesting with other planes flying around.Finally, I recommend a decent PC to run it on, and a decent yoke and rudder pedals.  I use the Saitek products. You might want to try a few tweaks too.  I recommend Frooglesims youtube video called 'VLOG: How to get better FSX performance' and the tweaks referenced in the Megascenery manual.  Matt Smith is also a good user to watch youtube videos on.As I said, beware, because if you do get hooked, you may end up spending a lot (of time and money) on the hobby. Time and money very well spent though.  "

												I can't even start this simulator. I had it before boxed but lost the media so I thought I buy it as Steam Version.But all I get is a jumping airplane. I can't control it and also can't start the engines. But as what I know from the boxed version: It reminds me of SimCity with the cheesy sound and the not so nice interface design. It got a lot of bugs and I would not call this a well programmed piece of software.I fly a lot of DCS A-10C and that is just a great simulator. I think the good days of Microsoft Flight Sim are over.

												Microsoft Flight Simulator 10 (FSX) In the steam sale at $4.99 (80 percent off) was absolutely worth it not to have to worry about buying discs again. Masses of free addons and content available on the flightsim sites, so you never need to buy the planned DLC unless you really want it but these simulators with this quantity of existing free content on flightsim sites all over the web are under-selling that aspect of the game and community by not including steam workshop as an easy way to import content, instead of trawling the internet for it.If you are only ever going to buy one flight simulator, and even you are new to flight simulation and want something that you can add to and get a lot of time out of, you really should consider this one, specially in the next steam sale.  In the meantime there are plenty of other really outstanding free open source simulators if you just want to try the genre.TL/DR: 9/10 worth it just to have the last in the historically important Microsoft Flight Simulator series in your collection.  Demo/Trial version here  http://www.microsoft.com/Products/Games/FSInsider/downloads/Pages/FlightSimulatorXTrialVersion.aspx "

												As far as a pick-it-up simulator goes, I still have a hard time suggesting any other Flight Simulator over this one. It comes with many planes and, unlike another simulator recently released, has an entire world full of airports. It's easy enough to find free airplanes online instead of paying $20 or more per plane, and as far as realism goes, it isn't that different for someone who isn't an aspiring or real pilot. I'm sure the hardcore among us (or those with normal vision who have the career available to them) could tell me all day what the differences are, but I myself don't care enough for that. There's a TON of flight help and learning tools available, and a ton of aspects about flying are picked apart and explained through missions and text reads through the Learning Center.Having said all that it has some issues. It crashes randomly, has atrocious graphics for this day and age (people saying they're better are probably playing on Ultra for the first time as Microsoft wouldn't allow the graphics to be updated), and the menus could really be streamlined especially for new comers, but if you're used to this game and want it in the glory of Steam connection and not have to pray to the gods Gamespy, you're probably willing to look over that. And what a glory the Steam multiplayer is, no longer do I get disconnected from Gamespy for blinking too hard! I still seem to disconnect from my friend's games after about an hour, but odd quirks to be expected for an old game like this. This game is a memory hog, seems to have some issues with certain graphics cards, and the outside camera is still as wonky as ever, but these are things you end up getting used to. The price and available features alone would make me suggest this over any other Flight Simulator out today, and I hope there's better things to come for this otherwise dead genre (really all I ask for is updated graphics so my eyes don't bleed on those beautiful splotches of square ground, and a cargo transport Euro Truck Simulator style).

												If you have money on steam and you don't know what to do with it you can buy this only if it's on sale for 5$ or less, you can find something way way way better for less than 25$. This a game is a definite cash grab and I bought it because I was impatient and bought this game because it looked like it had good reviews and really cool pictures and videos, but in the game the graphics are pretty bad. Ik graphics don't have to do with really anything, thats just one minor thing. THE ONLY THING TO REALLY DO ON IT IS FLY AND THATS IT. When I thought ""Microsoft Flight Simulator X"" I thought that you would do the insides of the planes, or design it differently, but basically all you do is fly. Now there are missions in this game, which I guess in the only good thing in it, but when I opened the first mission up, it seemed very unfinished, in the tutorial there were untyped words (coming from someone who has some untyped words in his review probably), wrong punctuation, and apparently you need an Xbox controller to fly it because the tutorial narrarator tells you some things to do with the keyboard and mouse, but to move the plane he only talks about the xbox controller, it has STEAM EDITION at the end of the game title..... Although I havent played them but have seen them, the intermediate - expert missions seems slightly decent but thats about it. The multiplayer is awful, when you crash into things you either noclip through it or just automaticly 'plop' right up on the thing your crashing onto. The controls are very difficult so I had to use the keyboard for some controls and the xbox controller aswell at the same time. And OH right when I'm righting this review I see that its 20$ for another airport and 25$'s for seperate planes......... Ugh......... Anyways, the whole point is that if you want to buy this game you better be Bill Gates grandson and it better be on sale, and you got to be someone who just likes to fly with bad graphics and maybe do some plane missions. I'm sorry if you like this game and may have offended you but I just hated the cashgrab of this game, and btw I still think its a cashgrab and I bought it for 5$. It should be either free, 5$ or at the max 10$ Thanks for listening and I hope I helped the people on the fence of buying this game,			"

												A rehash of MicroSoft's ancient, abandoned Flight Simulator X code.  Once a good game/simulation but limited to Directx 9 (never given the promised Directx 10) and does not do well adapted to Steam. Unreliable with very limited and sometimes unhelpful support.  Recomendation, wait until Dovetail gets a handle on this product or switches to a different engine and check then.I'd have many more hours on FSX:SE if it would not crash, hoping support will eventually get around to fixing my problem)Update: a kind steam user helped me fix the crash problem (Hooray) but loud buzz when applying brakes and printing flight plans fails... .. .UPDATE: Finally got it to run, more or less, using these settings [1] No Directx 10 preview [2] No SLI. Also Microsoft dropped support for some graphic compression used by a lot 3rd party developers, some of whom are updating their models. And finally, using GPS navigation on Garmin 1000 goes haywire after a short while, making it useless for cross country navigation.Another UPDATE: Cross-country navigation Gamin 1000 autopilot problem can be eased but not solved by setting simulate rate to unity during transitions and changing simulation rates while paused.YET EVEN ANOTHER UPDATE: Late June FSX;SE has taken to hanging during launch, and therefore is unplayable. No help from support. Followed their post on how to deal with the hang but nothing worked,			"

												If you care about frame pacing, this is not the game for you.   Will not run smoothly at any framerate on any system, not even a smooth 30fps is achievable on a high end system due to the horribly unoptimized engine.   afaict, the game uses too much CPU, since the GPU usage never gets over 20%, and the CPU is working at ~80%.   I've tried everything, even with minimum graphic settings it's still a stutterfest.   I don't know why the CPU has to work so hard.  Even when you are rendering 60fps there is still a constant hitching and stuttering as the CPU loads more scenery.  Tried chaging CPU affinity, radeonpro vsync, triple buffering, flip queue size, fps cap, fsx.cfg FIBER_FRAME_TIME_FRACTION, nothing works.     The graphics are broken.   If it ran smooth, at least 30fps with good frame pacing, it would be great.    But it doesn't, so it's a horrible experience.     Disappointed.Update:  I have found some settings that produce a playable result on my [current gen] system (see comments).			"

												To all existing hardcore FX simmers for years hoping on improved frame rates and enhancements, Not now. Hold your pocket. Its much like a scam here. This supposed to be tagged with ""Aplha"" release / early access. Stay with the original boxed version and get this on discount in future years when everything is clear and stable, and not money oriented greedy setups with expensive useless 'arcade'ish DLC.			"

												If you care about frame pacing, this is not the game for you.   Will not run smoothly at any framerate on any system, not even a smooth 30fps is achievable on a high end system due to the horribly unoptimized engine.   afaict, the game uses too much CPU, since the GPU usage never gets over 20%, and the CPU is working at ~80%.   I've tried everything, even with minimum graphic settings it's still a stutterfest.   I don't know why the CPU has to work so hard.

												A rehash of MicroSoft's ancient, abandoned Flight Simulator X code.  Once a good game/simulation but limited to Directx 9 (never given the promised Directx 10) and does not do well adapted to Steam. Unreliable with very limited and sometimes unhelpful support.  Recomendation, wait until Dovetail gets a handle on this product or switches to a different engine and check then.I'd have many more hours on FSX:SE if it would not crash, hoping support will eventually get around to fixing my problem)Update: a kind steam user helped me fix the crash problem (Hooray) but loud buzz when applying brakes and printing flight plans fails... .. .UPDATE: Finally got it to run, more or less, using these settings [1] No Directx 10 preview [2] No SLI. Also Microsoft dropped support for some graphic compression used by a lot 3rd party developers, some of whom are updating their models. And finally, using GPS navigation on Garmin 1000 goes haywire after a short while, making it useless for cross country navigation.Another UPDATE: Cross-country navigation Gamin 1000 autopilot problem can be eased but not solved by setting simulate rate to unity during transitions and changing simulation rates while paused.YET EVEN ANOTHER UPDATE: Late June FSX;SE has taken to hanging during launch, and therefore is unplayable. No help from support. Followed their post on how to deal with the hang but nothing worked,			"

												Microsoft Flight Simulator 10 (FSX) In the steam sale at $4.99 (80 percent off) was absolutely worth it not to have to worry about buying discs again. Masses of free addons and content available on the flightsim sites, so you never need to buy the planned DLC unless you really want it but these simulators with this quantity of existing free content on flightsim sites all over the web are under-selling that aspect of the game and community by not including steam workshop as an easy way to import content, instead of trawling the internet for it.If you are only ever going to buy one flight simulator, and even you are new to flight simulation and want something that you can add to and get a lot of time out of, you really should consider this one, specially in the next steam sale.  In the meantime there are plenty of other really outstanding free open source simulators if you just want to try the genre.TL/DR: 9/10 worth it just to have the last in the historically important Microsoft Flight Simulator series in your collection.  Demo/Trial version here  http://www.microsoft.com/Products/Games/FSInsider/downloads/Pages/FlightSimulatorXTrialVersion.aspx "

												Microsoft Flight Simulator X was abandoned by Microsoft about 9 years ago. Dovetail Games was given the license to redistribute it, though. This means FSX is a ten year old game that hasn't been updated in almost a 10 years.DLC is massivly overprised.I would recommend this game to people that will get there money worth on a 10 year old game that should cost 10$ not 30$.5/10 IGN			"

												IF YOU ENJOY THE OTHER FLIGT SIMULATORS, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS.That being said, was it worth my $25? No. The only thing that has changed is the fact that you can run FSX from Steam. The Main Menu hasnt changed in looks since it first came out in October 2006. It's 2015. Im suprised Microsoft hasnt come out with a new Flight Simulator with better graphics, planes, missions. etc. I grew up playing Microsoft Flight Simulator 98, 04, X, and this Steam edition was a bit of let down. Now, I understand that this is still the Flight Simulator X that came out years ago just now available on Steam, but I was hoping there would be some type of workshop or a better layout of the game.Overall, I am a little dissapointed. I essentially re-bought FSX. IF Microsoft created a Flight Simulator 2015(2016), I would by it the week it would come out! Again, its a classic game, but very dissapointed.			"

												I'm afraid I can't give this game a positive review. Having played a mere 2 hours of this, I've found issues with:- Launching the game (crashed on launch).- Optimisation (any game where I have to manually go into the .ini and change settings to increase performance is a negative point for me) - Graphics (I don't care much for graphics, I still play the original DOOM) are substandard. That includes everything from scenary to cockpit models. I even tried installing a few graphical mods which barely improved the visual experience. - Flight Models (Having come from DCS, I notice a huge difference in how the aircraft performs.. It feels very arcadey)- Cockpit Fidelity (Half the buttons and switches in the cockpits aren't toggleable)I realise this is a 2006 game and perhaps I'm expecting too much from it. The initial 2 hours I've played have put me off completely, after I was initially hyped to begin playing. Whilst I paid considerably less than £19.99, I still can't recommend anybody buying this.  "

												MS flight simulator is good for what it is, unfortunately what it is, is a very old game struggling to work in your pc. The simulation itself is pretty good but the UI is just prehistoric. Unless you are willing to expend a lot of time and money (for the quite expensive plugins out there $100 and up)   it just looks/feels and plays  like a very, very old game. Don't even think about adding free addons they either are completely unnoticeable or  they will render the game useless requiring a reinstall.To be honest I really hope they decide to create a new version some day, one made for computers made after 2010 that dont require a $200 plugin to look correctly but as it is, I just cant recommend this.

												Purchased FSX Steam Adition a few months ago and have spent a fair amount of money on addons. the game crashed on me yesterday and i am unable to get back on, i keep geeting a message error saying  ""Microsoft Flight Simulator has stopped Working""  and "" A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a soluation is available"".The sad part is that there is nowhere to get techinical support, Steam just passes everything of, they are selling the product so they should be providing the support.I dont want to hear all the excuses or the typical so fall possable soluations its all bs. My computer is totally is used soley for FSX and the hard drive, video card etc is more that enough to run fsx. i also delected fsx and all of it files including everything for steam, i also did a complete clean of my computer and a full update of all driverds etc. I then reinstalled steam and fsx but still have the same problem.and it doesnt look like i am the only one having this issue, i thing it time for steam to take action asap and resolve this issue. its a great game when its working?Andre Fequet			"

												It's 10:10pm, 9 miles out of Sydney. I've been flying IFR from Adelaide, in RT. 737. My RT weather add-on throws up storms, heavy turbulence. My scenery add-on shows a beautiful Sydney in the distance, glimpsed through the heavy cloud. The take-off was simple, the AP locked on GPS track and the job is nearly done. I've been descending for a while, saving fuel... you know how it goes.I'm loving it. Calm. Controlled. Content.Out of the misty depth of somewhere between 9000 and 10000 I'm asked to turn left on 300 and descend and maintain 6000. I dial it in, acknowledge.  Easier to disengage AP now. We're nearly home.Suddenly. ""TRAFFIC ALERT"". An A320 is 12.00 o'clock 4 miles at 10000. Can I see him? No. Where? Sorry tower, no sight. No. Look, there he is. Flying above me. Phew. Sorted. Sorry. Were you talking to me? Turn left on 340, descend and maintain 4000? OK. Doing it now....(This turbulence. It's killing me.  Maybe I should go back on AP?)Sorry tower. Climb and maintain 6000?! What? Oh wait. I thought you said 4000? Oh... That wasn't me. I'm Sierra TANGO, not Sierra ROMEO. Ahhh... Climbing back to 6000, trying to smooth out the heading.Sorry. What was that? TRAFFIC ALERT. Again!! What sort of ATC are you?! 3 o'clock, 2 miles, 4500. Altitude check. 4500. Oh Oh! Collision course.... My life starts flashing before my eyes then I realise it was the Piper's strobe as he flies just feet in front of me. Phew.Sorry. Sierra TANGO. (Hey that\s me). I'm 500 below my assigned. Ahh.. What?? That's right. I'm supposed to be 6000. Check heading. 270?? I'm heading to Perth. Dammit. I need to sort the heading too! Climbing.... Turning..... Climbing.....WHAT'S THAT DAMN NOISE!!! Sink rate? What sink rate?!! GS is below 120. Head wind? Oh. Oh..... I drop the nose instinctively as I grab the throttle and ram them home. 130, 150, 170..... I knew I watched those airplane movies for a reason.Sorry tower. What? I'm 3000 below assigned. Yeah. Too bad. I'm busy.Pull up. Pull up. Pull u..........................It was then I realised that commercial heavy pilots don't get paid for 100% of their time. They get paid for that 1%.... just before they hit the ground.......gently.9/10You must use add-ons though.			"

Posted: March 31
												Summary of why I do not recommed this. ==============================(1). Old game engine. Game engine  seems to run on 2 of 8 available CPU threads. Low FPS (14-20) at 1080p in City areas even with a high spec gaming PC. (2). Only supports Preview DX10 which is unfinished and gives rendering errors - my main issue is Road Lights which look like black 8 pointed Stars. (3). The game looks pretty old and some basic landmarks are missing. To improve this you need to buy a texture pack. They are expensive. (4). Crossfire will not engage in DX9. Crossfire will engage in Preview DX10, however it does not help because the Game Engine itself sems only to run non 2 threads, not all 8.   Details: ======I just bought this on Sale on Steam. I used to play MicroSoft Flight Simulator years ago ~ around end 2001 on an AMD Athlon 64 based PC. I have some real world flying experience as a pilot (learning to fly a light aircraft, never completed the Pilot's Licence because I could not afford to complete the course at the time). I wanted to find out how much Flight Simulators have improved today. I had read reviews of Modern Flight Simulators available for PC today and this was recommended along with XPLANE-11.  I really cannot see why this was recommended as a Modern Flight Simulator at all. It should be even cheaper than the sale price.  It is very outdated. It does not seem to have improved that much in single player mode since Flight Simulator 2002 (end 2001) running on an AMD Athlon 64 based PC, in fact, I still have the PC and I feel could have just run this game on it instead. Seriously this just looks so old and outdated in comparison to a real 2017 title. I used to fly (pilot) for real out of one airport that is available on this game and It looks nothing much like the area, with very well known landmarks missing completely.In some places you can see the main road with cars driving straight through buildings which are planted in the middle of the road. Ridiculous but it did give me a laugh I guess. One other point, Steam is usually really easy to use for me. I buy the game, I install the game, and generally I just run the game with no problem. This thing took me about two hours and two install and verify attemptsjust to get running because of a really stupid requirement. You have to run Steam itself as Administrator before this game will run. I normally do not write negative reviews, but I feel in this case there is nothing much really to say that is very positive at all if you look for a Modern Flight Simulator.Some positive things I can think of: (1). One thing I can think of is it it looks and flys like the game did many years ago, with admittedly higher resolution and some graphical improvement at playable framerates. If you are into Retro Gaming and you do not have your old machine still running, and you have fond memories of playing Microsoft  Flight Simulator 2002 or later, then this game is for you. However. Regarding running the game with higher graphical settings. I tested this game on a 1920x1080 resolution. I have an i7-4770K (4 core 8 thread)  with Single R9 Nano FuryX active in this game review.(I have Two R9 Nano FuryX's installed but have not tried to run the game in Crossfire yet).Thats a reasonably high spec gaming machine, even for today. The CPU is running at stable +16% OC and the R9 Nano FuryX's are running at +5% stable OC target on the GPU Clock, with Fan and Temp and Power Targets maxed out. I am able to run the game with all visual settings maxed out and in that case it does look better than the game from end 2001. Even then though, things like water in harbors are completely static, no waves in the water etc.  In this case, even with a powerful Gaming CPU, GPU and running overclocked the Frame Rate drops to 14 FPS on a single monitor at 1920*1080p resolution. I wanted to run it on a Triple 1980*1080p Eyefinity Monitor Setup at the very least. I need to check what is going on exactly, probably the game can only run on 1 core. ---> Checked. i7-4770K = 4 CPU cores with 2 threads per core = 8 threads in total ( 8 Logical CPUs).   It looks like the FSX game launcher and background tasks max out 1 logical CPU (thread)  and the Game simulation itself max out two other logical CPU's (threads). The remaining 5 logical CPU's (threads) have some low level / uneven activity.   Some more  positive points to consider. (2). The planes are very easy to fly using the mouse or keyboard mode, unlike the experience I had with XPLANE-11 demo in the past. It looks great but on previous Demo I just found it too hard to fly with the keyboard alone.But this may be because SFX is like a cross between a simulator and an arcade game versus a XPLANE-11 which seems to be attempting more of a real simulator experince using a special Flight Controller. More positive points I can think of about FSX. (3). You can get some nice screenshots, provided you are high enough altitude so you dont see how simple the buildings on the ground look. Perhaps I need to look at other features in FSX like a DLC pack, and MultiPlayer but I think I have been as fair as I can be in this feedback so far based on Single Player and Initial Install experience. If you are into Retro Gamning and want to play Microsoft Flight Simulator from 2002 or later  then this is definitely for you. From that perspective it is nice that this game is still running and available on Steam. I think it is good that old games/code get preserved for future use. If you look for a Modern Flight Simulator though, do yourself a favour and  buy something else.This game seems to be pretty much MicroSoft Flight SimulatorX 2006 ported to Steam + new DLC with more planes / higher texture maps on DLC.  I have not asked for a refund from Steam yet as I am going to see if running the game with a Pair of R9 Fury X's in Crossfire or running it with an i7-4790K and a Pair of R9 Nano FuryX's will allow me to play at over 30FPS on Maxed out Graphics Settings at 1920*1080p.---> Update. If you have a highend GPU like an R9 Nano (FuryX),  Crossfire will not help the FrameRate on FSX:SE. (A). Crossfire will not turn on at all in DX9 Mode on FSX:SE. (B). Crossfire will turn on in ""Preview"" DX10 Mode. Total CPU Utilisition jumps from 55% to 73%.(C). On this game at least, turning on Crossfire make things worse in the toughest areas of the simulation where you need it.  I have lots of experience running Crossfire on this machine and on most modern titles that support Crossfire it runs well and will provide up good FPS Scaling increase.  The increase in CPU Utilisation turning Crossfire on is not unexpected.  However the problem is when you turn on Crossfire the Frame Rate will increase which will push up the load on the logical CPU's which are used to run the Game / Simulator. In FSX:SE only two logical CPUs run the simulator and they already run with very high utilization with Crossfire turned off. What I see when I turn Crossfire on is the additional loading due to  Crossfire processes is split off to the remaining 5 logical CPU, 1 logical CPU is already maxed out for the Game Loader and Settings interface at  around 90-100% utilisation. The remaining two Logical CPU Cores jump to 100% Utilization all the time. This results in CPU halting/CPU speedstep kicking in.  I want to look at the CPU Utilization Profile and see if I can get it running on Triple Eyefinity setup as well. ---> Update: Yes, Triple Eyefinity works fine, no Drop in FPS seen in this case with Crossfire off. I can run it at 6016X1080p, but the FPS is in 14-20 range. I think the reason I cannot increase the FPS is because the simulator engine seems to run on only two threads (Logical CPU's) with an additional thread for the Game Launcher/UI. That 's it for this review for now.Sorry but I cannot recommend this as a Modern Flight Simulator. It is OK for Retro Gaming.			"

												Ok. This game was not what I thought it looked like from the store. I know all games on steam make the pictures look better but this game takes the cake. The graphics on the highest setting look horrible, grainy, and old. They really make the pictures look better from on steam to the actual gameplay. The menus are also very hard to navigate and this game ultimatly looks extreamly old, which it is. You would think however, that for 24.99! That the developers (Microsoft...) would update the graphics if they would release the game on steam. Online is also very boring. There are probobly around ten servers in total. And there are less than ten people on each one. To sum this up... for the expensive price I am very upset with this game. SUre, the physics are great and it is very realistic but to even mention the fast the on my 1080p display the game starts out at around 420p you can tell the game is old and not updated. There were many things I was unhappy with as well but on top of all of this the cameras have such bad views that it finally made me stop playing and write this review. There are many other flight sims out there for the same price that are around the same price or less the look and preform better. So, my final verdict for this game is that if you are looking for a sim with god physics and realistics then great, get this game, if you want a good game all around I would highly suggest putting your money elsewhere.

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing			"

												Some optimisations and compatibility fixes with current Windows versions help make FSX more playable than the boxed version, which is a nice thing. However, if you're a seasoned flyer with add ons or intend to look to third party add ons then be careful. There's a blame game going on about who is responsible for making some add ons work correctly with the steam version. As it's a steam title, updates are likely to keep breaking third party add ons that use code with certain versions of Simconnect and other Dll's. I've found a couple of my addon aircraft will not run at all and some addon scenery that use dll's will crash if enabled.  The third party devs though aren't in any hurry to make changes.Aside from these issues, it's still the great FSX we know and love. "

												Maybe you had to be a kid when Flight Simulator was still an eagerly anticipated franchise. Going back and playing this is still just as fun and immersive as ever. Deliberately crashing the plane still packs a punch; mostly because it's always suspenseful and unexpected in how long it actually takes to crash.The only drawback is no Meigs Field. That's why the series died, Microsoft. You took Meigs Field from us.			"

I realize that developers need to be paid for the investment of their time...I get that...but the DLC is seriously expensive and this whole DLC economy you have going on completely sucks! You guys could seriously have went the Steam Workshop route and made new planes, gauges, and liveries more accessible to anyone other than lottery winners!			"

THIS GAME IS GREAT!The Game comes with a large variety of aircraft and missions aswell as the feature to play multiplayer and Freeflight, there are more features than when Microsoft released it and it's now cheaper! The Controller support is of great help for people without the money to buy a yoke, throttle quadrant etc. straight after purchase as playing with the keyboard is almost impossible. I told some of my friends about this game and within a week both have bought it and are enjoying playing it immesely as am I. Basically a MUST BUY!Also, if the game does not include an aircraft or airport scenery you like/require the vast Internet community and Steam Workshop will almost certainly have what you're looking for usually with a discounted price or even free!In conclusion this game is one of the best I have ever bought, so maybe you might like it too!STAR RATING (10): 18  "

												Alright guys.Here's the ULTIMATE FLIGHT SIMULATOR !So here's the point, i've got over 1k hour on the Microsoft version (Non-Steam), this simulator is LEGENDARY.GraphicsSo, basicly the vanilla version of the game sucks. yeah, it just sucks. it's horrible. BUT.When you mod this game, it becomes a freakin' Real Life Simulator. (REX, ENB, ORBX, Active Sky, EZDok...)Sadly, when i'm writing this review, the steam edition dosen't support any of these mods (exept rex) :(The AirplanesAgain, the normal aircrafts sucks (the ones delivered by Microsoft), well let's say they are only for begginers, or people who don't care about the realism, or even people who just wanna have fun, making barrel rolls with a 747.However, the aircraft addons are soo realistic, some are even approved by Boeing ! (PMDG). There's some airplanes addons for all types of aircraft going from general aviation to Jumbo Jets.Settings, optimisation, communityThe Steam Edition of the sim brought new optimisations to the normal Microsoft version. It's good, but not what i expected, i find some bugs here to there, nothing really shocking, and btw the sim FINALLY supports Windows 8.1..The community of the sim is REALLY ♥♥♥♥in' nice ! AVsim is always really helpful, tehre's some forums, reviews, downloads... i can clearly say that the community kept this game alive from 2006, wich is ♥♥♥♥ing HUGE !Overall ratingSo, this sim isn't clearly for everyone, maybe only for passionated (or how the ♥♥♥♥ it spells) people, but even if you're a big noob, you will clearly find your piece of cake :)12/10.

												Don't pay attention at the hours played displayed up there, because I have over 1.000 hours in the non-steam version.The Default Microsoft Flight Simulator X Steam: Edition is a light-realistic simulation game, which is, it has a moderate realistic simulation, physics is kind of Good, and the cockpit interaction is bad and very limited (not that it is bad, but very easy and extremelly non-realistic, as you do not have interaction with even 30% of the cockpit buttons, switches, displays, etc), so what makes Flight Simulator X so popular among pilots and airplane lovers?nothing more than it's gigantic amount of Addons (not talking about Steam's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ addons, I'm talking about third-party addons you find on Just Flight and sim market.com), like PMDG's, Aerosoft's, Just Flight's and Carenado's ultra-professional airplanes, such as the Boeing 737, 747, 777, Bae Jetstream 41, A320/A321, DHC-6, DC-8, Beechcraft A31, B200, and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ others. These are just to point out the most famous ones, as there are a lot other developers and third-party airplanes who wouldn`t fit in a 100 pages review.Flight Simulator X is a fully modular flexible simulator, the default Flight Simulator X in this steam page is not 10% of the realism it is able to reach, in the last paragraph I pointed out about 1% of the addon airplanes out there, but not it is not limited to airplanes, the third-party developers produce incredibly beautiful and breathtaking realistic scenery addons, weather engines, weather and lighting addons, graphic addons, crew addons, airports, flight planners, traffic, and the amazing (totally free) ultra-professional multiplayer that is VATSIM, and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ absurdly gigantic amount of other addons payware or freeware avaiable on the internet.If you want to take a peek of what is a fully-realistic addon powered flight simulator X, just open up youtube and type in ""FSX as real as it gets"" and search for a recent video, you'll know what I mean with breathtaking graphics and realism.Flight Simulator X can be a simple fly-for-fun kind-of-realistic simulator for people who never flown a plane, which is the default FSX, or it can be a breathtaking advanced extremelly fully-realistic ultra-professional as-real-as-it-gets  airplane simulator with over 100gb worth of addons (trust me, my FSX has 133gb in HDD space), it's completelly up to you.

												Maybe you had to be a kid when Flight Simulator was still an eagerly anticipated franchise. Going back and playing this is still just as fun and immersive as ever. Deliberately crashing the plane still packs a punch; mostly because it's always suspenseful and unexpected in how long it actually takes to crash.The only drawback is no Meigs Field. That's why the series died, Microsoft. You took Meigs Field from us.			"

												Don't pay attention at the hours played displayed up there, because I have over 1.000 hours in the non-steam version.The Default Microsoft Flight Simulator X Steam: Edition is a light-realistic simulation game, which is, it has a moderate realistic simulation, physics is kind of Good, and the cockpit interaction is bad and very limited (not that it is bad, but very easy and extremelly non-realistic, as you do not have interaction with even 30% of the cockpit buttons, switches, displays, etc), so what makes Flight Simulator X so popular among pilots and airplane lovers?nothing more than it's gigantic amount of Addons (not talking about Steam's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ addons, I'm talking about third-party addons you find on Just Flight and sim market.com), like PMDG's, Aerosoft's, Just Flight's and Carenado's ultra-professional airplanes, such as the Boeing 737, 747, 777, Bae Jetstream 41, A320/A321, DHC-6, DC-8, Beechcraft A31, B200, and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ others. These are just to point out the most famous ones, as there are a lot other developers and third-party airplanes who wouldn`t fit in a 100 pages review.Flight Simulator X is a fully modular flexible simulator, the default Flight Simulator X in this steam page is not 10% of the realism it is able to reach, in the last paragraph I pointed out about 1% of the addon airplanes out there, but not it is not limited to airplanes, the third-party developers produce incredibly beautiful and breathtaking realistic scenery addons, weather engines, weather and lighting addons, graphic addons, crew addons, airports, flight planners, traffic, and the amazing (totally free) ultra-professional multiplayer that is VATSIM, and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ absurdly gigantic amount of other addons payware or freeware avaiable on the internet.If you want to take a peek of what is a fully-realistic addon powered flight simulator X, just open up youtube and type in ""FSX as real as it gets"" and search for a recent video, you'll know what I mean with breathtaking graphics and realism.Flight Simulator X can be a simple fly-for-fun kind-of-realistic simulator for people who never flown a plane, which is the default FSX, or it can be a breathtaking advanced extremelly fully-realistic ultra-professional as-real-as-it-gets  airplane simulator with over 100gb worth of addons (trust me, my FSX has 133gb in HDD space), it's completelly up to you.

												Although I haven't spent that much time on Flight Simulator X, I've played since Flight Simulator 98. My favorite type of aircraft is the Boeing 737-800. I just wish they had more aircraft types available, but not at these horrible prices. 1 Additional plane for 21 EUR? I'm afraid I'll stick to the original version I purchased during the Steam Winter sale...			"

												Microsoft Flight Simulator X, now owned by Dovetail games have re-released the game onto the steam platform. There may be no actual new gameplay features, but a endless list of bug fixes to help support this classic, yet fantastic game onto newer computers makes the experience much better.Back in the days before 2010 I would play the boxed editon, I would encounter endless crashes mid-flight for no apparent reason. I would be cruising at 35000ft directing to my next waypoint and all of a sudden, ""Microsoft Flight Simulator X has stopped working."" Then boom. Flight over. This use to drive me nuts. Thanks to Dovetail Games re-releasing the product to make it extremely stable with new computers, I can fly now without the stress and worry that the simulator would stop working.If you have the boxed edition, getting the steam re-release is an absolute must.If you don't have it, then I will still say the exact same thing, I have spent so many hours on this extremely versitile simulator. Whether I go for an IFR flight with a virtual airline whilst connecting to an online network with thousands of pilots and controllers or whether I go for VFR flight, I still get the same satisifaction.Admittely though, if you are like me and wanting to take your simulation experience to the next level, you are going to have to purchase addons, to make especially IFR flights in commercial planes more realistic. As much as the default 737 -800 and A321 are ok to start off with, you become hungry to endevour in the replica aircraft, like the PMDG Boeing fleet that costs up to £40 or the Aerosoft fleet that usually is about £30. Then you want your home airports to look like the real thing and so on. You become to demand more.This is game fantastic, But in my opinion, it is a very much a base package for what is an ever growing flight simulation world.I still though totally recommend this. It could be your purchase of the year.			"

												So I may have no hours on Steam Yet, but I have a lot of experiance with the boxed verson.This game is fantastic for flight simulation, with a catch. The game is from 2006, it isn't the most realistic, the textures are outdated, so if you want realism you will have to pay the price, and that means buying numerous add ons to improve the experiance. But when all upgraded this is one of the best flight simulators on the market, with the exception of Prepar3D, which is great if you have a beefy PC and a lot of cash.If you want a better casual simulation, FSX is ok, certainly great if you have a beefy PC, X-plane offers slightly better graphics and other things.But overall, with my experiance I reccomend this to no end.EDIT:  If you already own the boxed gold edition like I do then don't use this game as a replacement yet, many third party add-ons that I have tried are not working correctly and as a result forcing me to uninstall this game untilthe issues are fixed. So I still reccomend the game but be warned that many of your add-ons will not work. I will provide a few now.CLS 747 200/300 series: No VC and sound issuesJust Flight Traffic 360: No traffic. Default general aviation only.			"

												So after it's FSX as we know it, only with a few goods and bads involved. The biggest good is that it's much more resource friendly than the boxed version. But that's about where the line gets drawn.The bad on the other hand is far more noticable for those that want to make FSX:SE more...relavent. Third party weather addons like Active Sky Next and REX don't work. Texture addons like FTX and REX don't work. PSPassengers and Air Hauler don't work. Even though FSUIPC reportedly now works. If you have a PMDG aircraft, don't install it into FSX:SE. Why? Doesn't work. Haven't tried using Flight Sim Commander or FSAcars yet. Crossing my fingers they work.Even so, i'd still recommend this version. Why? It's stable, it already has many bug fixes taken care of. It's actively (or so Dovetail tells us) being worked on and updated. In short, for someone who is interested in a casual flight sim, FSX:SE will work just fine. Most other aircraft mods (payware and freeware) work just fine. It's FSX. It's the old love. Enough said.			"

												The age of this game shows in its user interface (settings / controls etc) but the gameplay itself is superb. Setting up controls can be fiddly, as there are a huge number of them, but not all need to be mapped to achieve a successful flight. The in-game graphics are fabulous and especially so in some cases, and the flight characteristics of the included aircraft seem very accurate and well-modelled (to me anyway, with only 1 hours' worth of real-world flight experience!). And it's a huge amount of fun, with hundreds of different locations around the world in which to fly. At the price I paid for the game (9.99GBP) I would say that it's a complete steal. So if you like flight sims, what's stopping you?			"

												This game is not for the average pilot!I got into a simple freeroam simulation and couldn't figure out the abundant amount of controls, after a good 5-10 minutes of trying to figure out which buttons do what (I am also tring to play with a 360 controller), wasn't too hard after that.My favorite part about the game is that it features SO many locations, I managed to load up a simulation in a cesna taking off from my local Pearson International Ariport, to Bradford, and managed to make the trip back and land again in Pearson.I can't wait to learn more about the game and try out more unique simulations!10/10 Best Chillout Sim.

												I remember flight sim games from the '80's and loved them. When FSX went on sale this summer, I had to buy it after watching it sit in my Wish List for weeks on end.FSX offers somthing for every fan of flight simulation. It's as easy or challenging as you want it to be. The multiplayer feature is actually fun because everday there are dozens of people who not only play on the servers, but they actually communicate with other players.If you enjoy flight sim games, or if you're just curious about flight sim games, you won't be disappointed in FSX. Buy it, buy it now before the price goes back up!			"

												So, as a short and rather informal review into FSX SE; for those of you wondering whether or not you should buy this game. DO IT!If you, like me, have ever played FSX before, you will know all too well that it was incredibly demanding on the CPU blah blah blah, and it really didnt run too well at all. This however, FSX SE, has fixed all that and now I can finally play this stupid simulator/game without it crashing or glitching out every 5 seconds! It's great!So... If you're unsure as to whether you should buy this game or not, I would say go ahead and do it! You can still add in freeware just like you could before too!P.S. Multiplayer works perfectly!			"

												There’s a tiny little airfield down the road from the house called Sandown Airport. It’s far too short for airliners to land or take off from, but I sure as hell tried it with a Boeing 747-400 in this game! To make a long story short, I ran off the runway, ran over several houses, finally limped into the air, forgot to use my flaps and slammed into the ground. I loved every minute of it.Almost any airport you can think of (and many you don't know about) are in this game, and there are also plenty of aircraft included with the game to tide you over until you set off to the Internet to look for a massive variety of freeware and Payware jets and helicopters! This is a game which is definitely worth playing if you want to have some fun, and a useful learning tool if you're seriously into simming. Flight Simulator X is also far less taxing on many computers, making it a perfect alternative for computers who can't run the fiendishly-large X-Plane 10. FSX is used by everyone from total newcomers, like me, to professional airline pilots.In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend picking this game/simulator up, because no matter how serious people can be with it, you can find many ways to amuse yourself in the vastness of Earth's skies.

												If you are buying this steam version because some people said it’s smoother and gives more FPS, you’ll be disappointed because there is no enhancement whatsoever apart from the return of multiplayer. I own a boxed version and have acceleration with service parks including lots of add-ons. I get a reasonable FPS in my windows 7-64bits but just like every fsx simmer you never get enough. So when I read the feedbacks here about how it was improved, I decided to give this steam version a go. I bought it yesterday, download took like an hour or so and installation was smooth. I have made few flights now, the truth is that the only difference is that it is a combination of Gold Edition, Acceleration and Service park, and that Multiplayer is back, also uiautomationcore.dll was added to the main directory for windows 8. Performance is exactly the same as FSX Deluxe Edition with Acceleration and service park without any add-on or tweak.I have to admit that I am not very sad that I bought this steam version, but this is because my boxed version is almost cracked and I think it’s a good idea to have a digitally signed one saved at Steam library. Another thing I’m hoping for is that since this simulation is very old and therefore do not take advantages of new and better graphic cards and systems and Microsoft no longer provide updates, hopefully with steam re-releasing it now future updates will be a possibility, if not it is going to be a waste for those who have boxed version already. As for those wondering if existing addons will work. Almost all addons that you can normally copy and paste into FSX will work in Steam version, Mine worked, I have never installed any which needs installation yet. Also I installed this version in the same PC I already have FSX, both are working fine.If you want to read the reviews, from the beginning there is a separate tab for positive and negative feedbacks, which I didn’t notice. The default is positive so make sure to check the negatives also. "

												I have been a sim pilot for 15 years. in the UK and NZ.  I still have the 2002/4, also the Deluxe Edition X, I did have the Steam Edition X as it is up to date for the better add-ons. But I lost it through a repair on my PC. I can't find it to use it or the email with the Key number. I thought I could get it back free from Steam, no they said I can only get it once from them. I have tried to pay for another one. But they refuse me as they say it is in my Steam library  !?  "

												As flight sims go, FSX is pretty good though showing a bit of age. But the Steam version is a major upgrade over the original boxed version. Features are pretty much the same. What is different is being recompiled and reworked to now work much better and smoother than before. No out of memory errors, etc.But the one thing that would make it awesome is VR support! Please, Dovetail, build in VR support!Vive hits this holiday season and the Oculus CV hits Q1 2016. I've flown Prepar3D (Lockheed's training version of MS FS) using a VR plugin and it really changes the sim. It really does put you in the cockpit. The effect is amazing!We need built-in VR support!

												Last time I had Microsoft flight simulator was when FS2000 was released, at the time the graphics were good and a nice choice of aircraft, after a year or two I gave up the hobby and moved on to Train Simulator.Twelve years later I saw Flight Simulator X advertised for sale on Steam and I thought why not. I can honestly say I am certainly not disapointed. The graphics are great and have experienced no buffering what so ever.Just completed a flight from Bermuda to Miami and thought I'd try out the realtime weather. Left Bermuda in nice sunshine and landed in Miami International during rain and a thunderstorm and the realism of the auto-pilot trying to keep the aircraft at 4000ft at 220kts with turbulence I thought was great.Although I have not got a joystick, i'm just using the autopilot and a keyboard, I am landing alot better than I did on FS2000. Looking forward to see what DLC gets released and maybe new Virtual Airlines will appear like there was 15 years ago.			"

												Quite psooibly the best non-combat flight simulator around and it doesn't require a supercomputer to run on high settings.  The boxed version will not install on  Windows Vista Service Pack 2 or newer so FSX Steam Edition is a welcomed form of the game.  MS Flight Sim veterans will find the controls easy to find as they are practically the same as FS 2004, and people new to the MS Flight Sim series will find the program easy to learn.  The Steam Edition includes all the expansion packs for Microsoft Flight Simulator X.			"

												There was a lot that could have been done to make this game great, but someone dropped the ball. In order for you to be able to play the way you want to, you need to buy more dreaded DLC. The controls re complicated and many. Unless you have a full working sim cockpit it is virtually impossible to do certain things. Such as auto pilot. For reason ine continually crashed whenever i was trying to get out of game, or something simple like finish a tutorial.I would have to exit all the way out then get all the way back in. Very annoying.			"

												Spending 300 Hours + on this simulator and 7000 + on Boxed Flight Simulator X Edition I have found that many bugs that arrised in FSXSE are due to the Windows Operating System 8.1 most of them can be fixed with another addon that costs £29.99 called FSUIPC. This corrects the control loss issue by routing all your controls through FSUIPC its disable FSX's privelage to USB Suspend the Controls. Great Upgrade from FSX Boxed.

												WOW!!! This game is incredible it is the most immersive simulation you can buy despite its age it has aged amazingly.This is a must have in my oppinion you can fly a aircraft like you can in real life with the default or add on planes i would recommend the pmdg 737, that makes fsx  look amazing the flight dynamics are 99% realistic even the details on the outside of the plane are amazing. The modding community for fsx is huge and still goes on to this day making new aircraft and you can even buy magazines about fsx or other simulators that have something to do with flight  i would reccommend this to anyone who loves planes as much as i do.

												I do recommend this but with two MAJOR qualifications:1) I'd only buy it when it goes on sale, which I did. You won't be kicking yourself for overpaying for this. No more than $15.00.2) Don't expect the terrain realism that you've come to expect having used Google Earth and it's flight simulator. For example, just fly to where you live and see how awful Microsoft FSX depicts your neighborhood, if you can even find your neighborhood. Then compare that to Google Earth's flight simulation over your neighhood. Enough said.Then why do I still recommend it?Because it has good cockpit and flight control realism. You could actually learn how to fly many types of airplanes with Microsoft FSX. Just don't look too closely at the scenery.			"

												I have owned the box copy of Flight Simulator X for about 6 years now and had come to the conclusion that I would never get it working well without dropping a lot of money on a high end system... until I got FSX:SE. With my PMDG 737 NGX add-on I used to have a very choppy experience. Now I can run with higher graphics settings AND have enough frames that the PMDG add-on (which uses a ton of CPU) is much smoother. I see about a 5-10 frames increase which is about a 25% increase in what I used to get. Even when the frames dip, the game seems to handle it better.Long story short, if you have FSX and want some more frames (which can be vital to a good landing IMO) then get FSX: SE. To me it feels like a whole new game.			"

												So, as a short and rather informal review into FSX SE; for those of you wondering whether or not you should buy this game. DO IT!If you, like me, have ever played FSX before, you will know all too well that it was incredibly demanding on the CPU blah blah blah, and it really didnt run too well at all. This however, FSX SE, has fixed all that and now I can finally play this stupid simulator/game without it crashing or glitching out every 5 seconds! It's great!So... If you're unsure as to whether you should buy this game or not, I would say go ahead and do it! You can still add in freeware just like you could before too!P.S. Multiplayer works perfectly!			"

												The simulator looks fantastic, the steam edition is a better version in terms of performance than the boxed version of the FSX.Some updates are coming out, something that the boxed FSX has not seen in a while.On the other hand, the reason for these updates is due to the fact that the FSX:SE seems to have issues with many addons, some of the addons that are widely used by the FSX community, seem to not work in SE, example would be the PMDG airplanes, which simply do not work.All FSX:SE needs is to have some updates injected to deal with the addons, and the developers also changing their addons to work with FSX:SE and this would be a very very strong product.FSX:SE also finally allows for shared cockpit, so you can have a commander and first officer working together to fly and land airplanes.I've used this feature, but it's not working well, it always takes about 2 hours of frustration disconnecting and connecting, recreating sessions until everyhting works, but when it does, it's a fantastic experience.

												Having started to get my private license, I have been wanting a solid simulator.  This sim is what my school uses when actual flight isn't ideal, so when it came to steam, and at a reasonable price, I jumped on it.  This is great to get a solid idea of how flying a plane actually is.  I do have some complaints, though, which are that the controls for rudder/ground steering do not function very well for me.  One touch makes a dramatic turn, and are difficult to fine tune.  Another complaint is that the game starts having framerate issues when approaching some airports, though I cannot tell if that is my system or the game itself.I recommend finding information about the planes that you are flying to know exactly what they are doing, as this is a sim.  That way you can figure out best climb speed, role speed, best glide and so on, because they will matter in this simulator.  It will also help to learn about traffic patterns and other things like that.  Otherwise, give it a try and have fun!  I do, and I intend to invest in some flight controls for it as well.Quick tip - for most aircraft, it's throttle for altitude, pitch for speed, something most first-timers might find helpful.			"

												FSX Steam.Well. I saw this version of the old masterpiece at 50% reduction so I bought in. I think that for my 12€ or so it's a decent price. So, what are my impressions? I'll keep this short.Firstly, the almost 5 hour download astonished me, considering that the disc version is installed and up and runnung in less than an hour. But fair enough, I don't expect the earth for that price.When I'd tweaked the settings to the same as my disc version I took a Mooney Bravo up from Kai Tak, just for a quickie.The first thing I noticed - has anyone else? - is the torque drag (prop plane pulling to one side gradually on the run up to take off). That's cool, because you do get some of this in most real single props.The flight itself was nice and smooth, 50fps with no stutters, and no 3rd party performance booster. That's good. A lot of people want more fps than that but 50 works fine with me, whether I can get more or not - it also frees up resources to puch other settings a bit more. And I did. And it worked fine. Well done there.I've only tried Kai Tak as yet, but the Kai Tak scenery... So-o-o-o-o empty!!! I've got the scenery addon disc on my disc FSX version and wow. I'm not only comparing but saying that Steam could have included some better scenery as a part of their tweaks of the disc version. Maybe in the pipeline?I'd be interested to find out how to uninstall the military planes as I've no time in this life for such stuff. I don't shoot at people - even if it's a simulator.Last thing, a question. Do freeware addons really install into Steam FSX? Maybe I could get my sceney discs installed into this version? Help?And last but certainly not least, can I get my FSUIPC (paid) download into this program?To summarise, then, I'll recommend this simulator (I wish Steam would stop calling it a game...) as I think with future updates initial issues will be ironed out and it will be a very good app indeed. I'll also keep my disc version though because I've got too much third-party stuff installed and I like flying around a full Manhattan scenery as opposed to the one that comes with Steam.Yep, I recommend it. It's worth the 20-odd Euros, no problem.			"

												Plane and Simple (see what i did there? :p) FANTASTIC!Not much i can say that every other virtual pilot or FSX fan on here hasnt already, i too own a boxed version.This is possibly the best money i have ever spent on a game..... ehum SIM.All my addons have worked, Carenado, RealAir, Orbx, i hear the PMDG fix is on its way or may have been fixed with the 12.01.2015 Update.Memory is used alot more efficiently, still one bug for me on ASUS N56VM, Intel i5 @3.2ghz, Nvidia GT 630M 2GBVram.>>>>> When switching from full screen to windowed FSX hangs with a blank screen and the sound fades out. CNTRL+ALT+DEL and opening task manager revives this strange glitch, i have only noticed it on Nvidia GPU's and never on ATI Radeon GPU's, i have never seen it mentioned so maybe its a Mobile GPU bug?10/10 though, absolutely fantastic release! So chuffed with Dovetail i payed my respects and grabbed a copy of TrainSim 2015 which is also great. Cant say enough how happy i am about this release, plus was double happy to see it came with all the extras, Acceleration, all the Deluxe and Gold Edition Large Cities.....Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy  "

												It's Flight Simulator X as we all know it, but it runs a bit better and it has multiplayer support once again. Most addons still work with it, although some do seem to have issues. The A2A Cessna 182 Skylane and RealAir Turbine Duke V2 both work fine though, and are a blast to fly for anyone wanting to experience General Aviation flying. Anyone wanting to fly military aircraft should check out DCS World first however, as FSX is primarily a GA/Commercial sim.			"

												I hate to refer to this as a game because most of the time I sit here staring intently trying to remember the most basic flight rules.  I have completed ground school years ago and have started getting back into learning the basics before getting into an actual plane, and although I loved FS9 and FSX, they never really worked well on Win7.  This works perfectly, no issues with graphics, updates, service packs, or even issues dealing with multiplayer.The realism is done very well in smaller planes, I can't comment on larger planes because I've never flown anything bigger than a Cessna 172, however it's a great sim to sit and brush up on skills and review procedures.  It is a simulator though.  If you want fun crashing planes and shooting down  other people in an arcade fashion, you probably won't enjoy this.  If you enjoy learning to fly, the lessons by Rob Machado offered in-game are very realistic and would cost thousands in real life.  If you want to brush up on flight, procedures, or just learn more about how planes work and mechanics of flight, this is a great game.			"

I recommend this game to everyone who  do not have knowledge about aviation. Don't forget this game is 8-9yrs old so you have to upgrade it with addons. You can find lots of free/payware addons on net like graphics enahancement, airports, ground environments, aircrafts with 'almost' real procedures and manuals with astonishing graphics, simulations of 'almost' real aircraft behavior in airspace which gives you amazing experience. I definitely recommend to everyone!!!			"

												The age of this game shows in its user interface (settings / controls etc) but the gameplay itself is superb. Setting up controls can be fiddly, as there are a huge number of them, but not all need to be mapped to achieve a successful flight. The in-game graphics are fabulous and especially so in some cases, and the flight characteristics of the included aircraft seem very accurate and well-modelled (to me anyway, with only 1 hours' worth of real-world flight experience!). And it's a huge amount of fun, with hundreds of different locations around the world in which to fly. At the price I paid for the game (9.99GBP) I would say that it's a complete steal.

												This game is not for the average pilot!I got into a simple freeroam simulation and couldn't figure out the abundant amount of controls, after a good 5-10 minutes of trying to figure out which buttons do what (I am also tring to play with a 360 controller), wasn't too hard after that.My favorite part about the game is that it features SO many locations, I managed to load up a simulation in a cesna taking off from my local Pearson International Ariport, to Bradford, and managed to make the trip back and land again in Pearson.I can't wait to learn more about the game and try out more unique simulations!10/10 Best Chillout Sim.

												If you are buying this steam version because some people said it’s smoother and gives more FPS, you’ll be disappointed because there is no enhancement whatsoever apart from the return of multiplayer. I own a boxed version and have acceleration with service parks including lots of add-ons. I get a reasonable FPS in my windows 7-64bits but just like every fsx simmer you never get enough. So when I read the feedbacks here about how it was improved, I decided to give this steam version a go. I bought it yesterday, download took like an hour or so and installation was smooth. I have made few flights now, the truth is that the only difference is that it is a combination of Gold Edition, Acceleration and Service park, and that Multiplayer is back, also uiautomationcore.dll was added to the main directory for windows 8. Performance is exactly the same as FSX Deluxe Edition with Acceleration and service park without any add-on or tweak.I have to admit that I am not very sad that I bought this steam version, but this is because my boxed version is almost cracked and I think it’s a good idea to have a digitally signed one saved at Steam library. Another thing I’m hoping for is that since this simulation is very old and therefore do not take advantages of new and better graphic cards and systems and Microsoft no longer provide updates, hopefully with steam re-releasing it now future updates will be a possibility, if not it is going to be a waste for those who have boxed version already. As for those wondering if existing addons will work. Almost all addons that you can normally copy and paste into FSX will work in Steam version, Mine worked, I have never installed any which needs installation yet. Also I installed this version in the same PC I already have FSX, both are working fine.If you want to read the reviews, from the beginning there is a separate tab for positive and negative feedbacks, which I didn’t notice. The default is positive so make sure to check the negatives also. "

												So after it's FSX as we know it, only with a few goods and bads involved. The biggest good is that it's much more resource friendly than the boxed version. But that's about where the line gets drawn.The bad on the other hand is far more noticable for those that want to make FSX:SE more...relavent. Third party weather addons like Active Sky Next and REX don't work. Texture addons like FTX and REX don't work. PSPassengers and Air Hauler don't work. Even though FSUIPC reportedly now works. If you have a PMDG aircraft, don't install it into FSX:SE. Why? Doesn't work. Haven't tried using Flight Sim Commander or FSAcars yet. Crossing my fingers they work.Even so, i'd still recommend this version. Why? It's stable, it already has many bug fixes taken care of. It's actively (or so Dovetail tells us) being worked on and updated. In short, for someone who is interested in a casual flight sim, FSX:SE will work just fine. Most other aircraft mods (payware and freeware) work just fine. It's FSX. It's the old love. Enough said.			"

												This is the classic Microsoft Flightsimulator X, now integrated into Steam. I already own the boxed version, but simply not having to install it via CD and having support for newer Microsoft operating systems like Windows 10 was reason enough for me to buy it once more through Steam.

												So I may have no hours on Steam Yet, but I have a lot of experiance with the boxed verson.This game is fantastic for flight simulation, with a catch. The game is from 2006, it isn't the most realistic, the textures are outdated, so if you want realism you will have to pay the price, and that means buying numerous add ons to improve the experiance. But when all upgraded this is one of the best flight simulators on the market, with the exception of Prepar3D, which is great if you have a beefy PC and a lot of cash.If you want a better casual simulation, FSX is ok, certainly great if you have a beefy PC, X-plane offers slightly better graphics and other things.But overall, with my experiance I reccomend this to no end.EDIT:  If you already own the boxed gold edition like I do then don't use this game as a replacement yet, many third party add-ons that I have tried are not working correctly and as a result forcing me to uninstall this game untilthe issues are fixed. So I still reccomend the game but be warned that many of your add-ons will not work. I will provide a few now.CLS 747 200/300 series: No VC and sound issuesJust Flight Traffic 360: No traffic. Default general aviation only.			"

												Cons: -Poorly detailed terrain (but you do get the entire planet).-Low speeds, even for commercial airliners.-No crash effects, kind of boring this way.-No co-pilot AI.-VERY steep learning curve, but it is a flight simulator.-No real air transit companies, but you do get real aircraft manufacturers.-Cities are lifeless.-No aircraft paint customization.Pros:-As mentioned, YOU GET THE ENTIRE PLANET!!!-Several planes and helicopters to start with, each with a few paint variants.-Every airport, big and small, seems to be included.-Confusing controls, but you can easily simplify them.-Real-time weather based on your location in-game and what it is really like there in real life.-Static weather choices as well.-Most major landmarks can be seen.-Controller support (I haven't used a joystick yet, but you can).-Air traffic controller and pilot voices, adding realism.-Can listen in on radios to hear talking between AI aircrafts and AI traffic controllers.-Great tutorials.-Multiplayer.-Sandbox mode, as well as missions-Custom difficulty (unlimited fuel, or not, etc).-Weather does affect the aircraft.-Aircrafts look good.-Well organized menus.-Able to customize your voice and callsign.-Able to customize your jets flight number.-It feels like a real airplane/helicopter.-Other aircrafts in the sky, landing or taking off.-A million ways to customize the gameplay.-Pretty good sounds, but I do recommend playing your music in the background.Verdict:-I have never actually flown a plane or helicopter before, nor will I. However, this game/simulator allows people, like me, to fly the aircrafts of their dreams! I wish that the cities were better, and the terrain looked like real terrain, but this is about the flying, and the flying is great! From fighter jets, which control like the ones in the ARMA series, to the commercial airliners, Microsoft Flight Simulator X provides a fun and exciting experience for anyone who wants it. -Minor flaws like the lifeless cities and the lack of damage/explosions does hold the game back a bit, but the flying more than makes up for it! -As I said before, the game has a huge learning curve and only real pilots will feel right at home. However, the game does provide several helpful tutorial missions that will get the rest of us in the cockpit in no time!-Overall, I think that Microsoft Flight Simulator X is a very good game. Now that it is on Steam, I recommend that anyone who likes airplanes, helicopters or simulators should give this a shot.-Balancing out the poor graphics with the amazing flying, I would give MSFSX an 8/10.

												This sim comes with a unique history - it should have been dead years ago but a stubborn community kept it alive, more specifically they kept developers alive who pushed the engine harder and farther than it was intended to be pushed, with some stunningly complex and complete simulations of the flying experience being released as addons.  This new release has met with some criticism, such as dovetail didn't listen to the community and releases addons that are weak, old and overpriced.  There might be some merit in that, but in some ways the complaints are inevitable.  On the good side, the sim is 64 bit, more stable and, like it or not, the future of the software.  The actual flight mechanics are ""solid"", I would say(X Plane has more sophistication there), but the addons are phenomonal and more and more are becoming compatible with the Steam version as devs see which way the wind blows. You'll definitely want to get some addons at some point.  I'd go for orbx scenery over the ones being sold here(expensive but just pick the areas you want to fly), ezdok camera(there's a beta for the steam edition that works fine), Accufeel, DX10 fixer, FSFlyingSchool and some of the higher rated planes that interest you(again, the ones on steam are 'meh' at best).  You'll probably want to make a decision on what sort of experience you want - some are really into all the navigation and procedures(real world pilots use them as a decent alternative to a real flight sim), some just want to fly around and look at scenery.  They are two very different worlds.			"

												I've had the SE version for a week or two and I like it alot. Smoother operation, easy to start (no CD). I do notice it renders geographic terrain a little differently. Not necessarily better or worse, just a little different. All my addons work fine, although it was thanks to the Steam community forum that I found fixes and config info to get things running well. Cheers to the Dovetail team.			"

												Had this Flight Simulator for ever. Best Addon is fsflyingschool, and they have a steam ready eddition. LOVE LOVE LOVE this, was gutted when Microsoft dropped it. So glad it's here now.Hopefully come next winter they'll be loads of new add-ons available on steam.Now I just have to save up. :)  Great for people from 5 to 105, can even get software to do VoiceControl.You can make it as real and complicated, or as fun and easy as you like. NOT merely a GAME, but a FLIGHT SCHOOL.Check out the flight school lessons and manuals. You can really learn how to fly. :)			"

												I have owned the box copy of Flight Simulator X for about 6 years now and had come to the conclusion that I would never get it working well without dropping a lot of money on a high end system... until I got FSX:SE. With my PMDG 737 NGX add-on I used to have a very choppy experience. Now I can run with higher graphics settings AND have enough frames that the PMDG add-on (which uses a ton of CPU) is much smoother. I see about a 5-10 frames increase which is about a 25% increase in what I used to get. Even when the frames dip, the game seems to handle it better.Long story short, if you have FSX and want some more frames (which can be vital to a good landing IMO) then get FSX: SE. To me it feels like a whole new game.			"

												I have probably logged a thousand hours on the original FSX....What this game could have been had the development team not been forced to shut down. In it's day, with support, it promised to be the most realistic flight simulator software avalible to the general public. Then support ended. Yet, that did not stop us die hard enthusiasts from creating libraries of add ons, modifications to dated/ glitched script and other improvements that kept the simulator relevent. Enter Steam. They bring the game back! Hooray! But no, not hooray for anyone but Steam. All of the simple fixes to make the game more enjoyable or even playable (logbook.bin, anyone?) did not even get touched. Missions still glitched to hell and back. Some airports still unplayable. Logbook issues, keybinding issues. I could go on but you get the drift here.This is a money grab by steam. Although it is cheaper than the boxed version, the developers spent minimal time fixing any of the bugs that made the boxed set so damn frustrating. Although it still works, if you are going to slap you name over a product like it is something new and improved, then improve it. Don't rely on us enthusiasts to improve the game for you. That is all.....			"

With a smoother running engine on windows 8.1 and update multiplayer, this game is worth every penny. If you play online, just be aware of all the noobs spawning on the runway as your landing.			"

												I was flying from KRFD to KJFK, the ATC made me crash into the water. Aeroflot fired me. No one died, though. Still 10/10 would fly again. Good game.			"

Multiplayer crashes within minutes always...i cant recommend it until its patched.			"

												As a pilot in the real world FSX was the signal best investment in training aids and tools I have made. The Steam Edition comes with reqired tweeks an updates that did not come with the last production run of the DVD virsion. Although there are some game elements I hezatate to call it a came, it is deffently a simulator that can be set to basic to just short of full motion avaition training device. I still us FSX: Steam Edition to fly a route before I go out on real flight. Some times I even try to fly a flight that was canceled and ussally find out why canceling was the right choise.			"

												It's a pretty damn good game, however the base game isn't great. You really need addons if you want to get a good experience. Free ones are available however are unreliable and if you don't download them correctly you can destroy your game (I did that, thus why I've bought it on steam). The good ones are pretty pricey and can also ruin your game if not installed properly. In total it can cost you over £50 and that's not including the accessories (e.g. joystick) you'll need to get the full experience. Don't be fooled by the trailer, the game looks like it was made in 2004 (because it was made in 2004) which is why you really need addons.			"
