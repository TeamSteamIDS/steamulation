												PLEASE READ!!!  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!! POSTED 10/9/14Let me start by saying Nether is an extremely fun game and sadly a very frustrating game as well. The high points in this game are a ton of fun especially if you enjoy open world pvp or survival pve. The low points usually make you turn the game off to cool down. Hackers/Glitches/Devs have ruined this game. As i type this it has been 2 weeks of Servers crashing until today where there are no servers left to join except for Last man standing PVP servers which let me stress is not the game you buy. I have checked their web site and they have not made a post since late August despite tons of people begging for help with servers being down and bugs that stop them from even opening Nether. It has now been 24-48 hours of no one being able to play the game and still not one word from devs as to what is happening with the game servers. It would be one thing if they posted saying server maintenance but it has now been 2 weeks of servers dissapearing with 0 communication. Steam should probably stop selling it as people will want there money back for this awful experience. So again I stress DO NOT BUY THIS. I will ammend this review if the Devs ever come back from their vacation. "

												This game fooled alot with awesome promise in early  access . Seemed thay just had to work out hacks and do a better job of loot placement and quantities. Developers promised a giant map which they abandonedand and substituted with the new crap to the west. They declared alpha just in time for the summer sale and discounted 50% to 80% off on release....who does that? you can get it as cheap as $3.00......why? Because without warning they removed weapon loot drops and added a bunch of containers to the map that you have to buy keys to open. Sound familiar?   This game is nothing more then a cash grab to sell keys . they went this rout when they realized peeps would rather grind then open the wallets to buy cosmetic items. When it was just 50% off the servers were full,then Oh what happened? Everyone realized it was a cash grab and now the servers are back to the normal 11/64 max. what do they do. 80% off.. This really bummed me out especially because i believed from the beginning that this woul;d be awesome. Fooled me once. Spend your money elseware or dont and wish you did!			"

												Do you like wastelands? Do you love guns?? Does the idea of having no fear whatsoever of horrifying monsters send a tingle up your spine? Then this is the game for you! In Nether you can find an assortment of things to do such as: Getting killed by a monster! Starving to death! Blowing your brains out over your keyboard!Welcome to Nether, where our slogan is, if you see it, shoot it! We'll get you hyped up over Co-op and helping eachother out, while showing you that you can be betrayed at anytime. But ♥♥♥♥ that♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you loved getting tied up and force fed a rotting banana in DayZ, you'll love mercilessly getting shot every time you spawn in Nether! Don't want to get shot? We introdue a brand new feature of spawning in a safezone! But guess what, ♥♥♥♥ you because it will be breached by Nether and will infact be a terrible place to spawn!You'll be thrilled when you finally lose your♥♥♥♥♥♥and join in the murder frenzy! Kill on sight and loot corpses then discover that you've paid $15+ for the biggest game of Call of Duty ever made! Minus the assortment of guns and perks you're prety much just trying to kill other humans. But wait, there's more! The totally no existent story will leave you in tears begging for more, and the newly added tribes will make you wish you had just spent the extra $15 for pretty much any other ♥♥♥♥ing game! Did we mention all of the special features? Boss battles that totally suck, nether surges, which you'll just avoid because ♥♥♥♥ that, and cosmetic items! Last but not least, the player base! All 300+ of our regular players will swear up and down that Nether is the greatest game ever and there is nothing more fun than sitting outside of a safezone and sniping new players. Because who wants their favorite game to be successful? Not our playerbase, that's for sure!So if you're a homicidal maniac who sucks at Call of Duty and feels the need to kill people in an indirect fashion; then this games for you! And if you're on the fence about giving it a try, here's some words of advice: Don't waste your ♥♥♥♥ing money.Edit: Games you'd do better spending money on-Dark Souls, DayZ, Dark Souls 2, Demon Souls(PS3), State of Decay, Banished(Hardest/most enjoyable game I've played after Dark souls, oddly enough).

												Ok, blatently put, Nether is great or at least it was. Whilst this game was in Alpha, it was excellent. The ambience was top notch and the sense of lonliness was exactly how it should have been. Of course, every game comes with it's flaws but it wasn't too much of a deal given the game was in alpha and the bugs were only minor. A texture not loading here and there and a few sounds sometimes dissapeared. Everthing was going great untill the big updated started to happen.When the motorbike was implemented through an update, it was obvious that this game was going downhill... and it did. Now what we have is more or less a focus on PvP to the point where it is now possible to play as the Nether (The creatures that inhabit the city). This removes all the ambience and idea of ""It's them against us"". Furthermore, the game began to degrade in quality. More bugs began to grow and the game began to just get more laggy throughout each update. They had also removed the ability to scavange the variety of weapons but instead replaced it by forging weapons together using the body parts of the Nether. Who knew that a demonic, spine, brain and eyeball makes an M9 pistol? Also, around the time that this game made it's movement from Alpha to Beta, all of the inventory, characters and accounts got reset. This also included the in-game money which some people paid for in the form of the Believers pack. All of the people who purchased these packs were going to be re-funded on the in-game money they may have spent. Now this is me speaking from personal experience so I don't know if anybody had the same issue, I had purchased the Believers pack back in the Alpha stages for £22.99 which means I had received about 20 of the gold coins or whatever the currency in-game was. After the reset, I was dis-heartened to find out that I actually was never refunded this in-game which I paid extra to receive.In short, it shocks me that all those who paid for this game in it's Alpha stages now have a game which they didn't pay for and may possibly never pick up again. You had one job Phosphor Games... one job...			"

Early Access Review
								First: I'd verify what most people say about the graphics and shooting mechs - they're nice and they work well enough. Second. here's how I feel about the overall design of the game:I'd like my money back at this point. I enjoyed this game for about three hours. I think I was getting lucky. I WAS also very excited about the prospect of completing missions in a survival game. Here are some things that ruined the game after the initial glow wore off. 1. Big missions seem more or less impossible to beat in games with random marauders running around.2. Courier missions (sounds fun, right?) End with PCs camping the goal zone. So you run for ~ 15 minutes and get shot. 3. Camping PCs have crazy/scary equipment that they bought with real money. F@#$ off. Get the F@#$ out of here. Unnacceptable. 4. Stuff spawns into the world randomly and without logical placement. I realize this is a genre standard - but it is a pathetic genre standard. 5. The world is too small for the style of gameplay. I saw the whole thing. 6. The buildings are SO similar that they may as well be proceduraly generated - which would massively improve this game BTW. 7. Here's an important one that nobody seems to mention - the Nether (monsters) TELEPORT and are UNESCAPABLE. I understand that this may be a clever way to prevent them from glitching but it also randomizes and renders unrealistic combat with them. It is ultimately annoying to fight them as a result. You run backward while they teleport toward you over and over - It's neat that they're dangerous but it is sad that they TELEPORT. 8. The level system is . . . uninteresting and seems not worth paying attention to. I think it'd be much better to just start everyone out fully leveled because 1. my fat cousin can run farther than my ""survivor"" and 2. My ""survivor"" eats loads more than my fat cousin. WTF. If there MUST be leveling, I'd like it to be under-the-hood pracice based leveling. 9. Prey or Pray is a dumb slogan - was before I bought - just throwin that in here. Please just stop saying it.  10. The masks that the serial-killer veteran players wear are. . .juvenile. I wound up hating all of them. In the time I played I remained a noob and the game felt VERY much about vets mercing noobs. To me that seems like a poor design. Noobs dont want to be bullied and vets dont (in most games) enjoy bullying noobs. These guys do it anyway - which makes me hate them. The juvenile masks make me hate them more. I don't want to spend my free time with these people. I know the game is in Alpha and that's why I've left out coments on glitches, completion, lame lighting effects and so on. These gripes are deep design issues and. . . well they aint likely to go away. Sorry. Here's some things that could improve it for me: 1. Non PVP server for doing some of those sweet lookin missions. Also a no paid-content option would be nice. I feel like paid add-ons in a PVP game is a bit of a deal breaker for me. 2. Bigger (Way) map, preferabley proceduraly generated - I know it's too late for that. 3. More sensible item spawning, perhaps mildly instanced item spawns - i.e. if I'm hurt it'd be nice to find bandages in an ambulance - ever.  I should be able to make logical descisions about where to go for what. 4. No lame outfits. Lame means - anything 13 year olds think looks cool. Just do a test group and delete everything they like.5. Some way to punish Vets for mercing noobs. If there is some system for that it isn't working. 6. Color. The apacolypse will not dull the color of leaves. Leaves will be leaves. Paint will not dull inside away from UV damage. The post-apocolypse will be in full color spectrum color. Please stop this idiotic mistake. Thanks Bethesda. 7. Make the Nether escapeable. It WOULD be more fun for EVERYONE to be chased by big scary stuff and have to hide.   8. Make it so players can run. Like a real person can run. Most adults could run across this map in one go at a good clip. It's like four city blocks on the long side. 9. Get rid of safezones. 10. Share rewards within vicinity with cooperation thus encouraging teamplay.  Out of 10:Graphics - 9 <- point off for the lame old post-apocolyptic color pallette blunder. Sound - 6 <- good but thin and repetive. Community - 2 <- Vets mercing noobs with ""Manhunt"" style Jason masks ruins this game for me. How about some goggles or some scarves or something. . . why phychopathic serial killers? Concept - 7 <- In theory this game could be good. In practice most of the ideas aren't realized at all. Design -5 <- The monsters are great, the city is pretty good, the People are REALLY lame. (bright green napsacks?) Where are these halloween masks coming from? I actually saw witch hunting hats like the ones from Warhammer 40k. Seriously, they're in there. hahahahaa.Mechanics - 2 <- Game mechanic integration ruins this game for me. It just isn't fitting all together. Random spawns. There isn't much to do - or you don't get to do it with jerks randomly killing you. Fun - 6 at first then on down to 1.  Game over.			"

												Now I'm usually really lenient when it comes to reviewing a game, so much so that in the most case I feel it best to avoid doing so, so as not to ""put off"" players from playing a game. But in this case I am really sad to say that I almost feel obliged to write a review. Now the game itself is pretty fun, I won't take that away from it, but frankly there are major issues that need sorting and frankly they aren't the kind that can just be ignored:There are a lot, and I mean A LOT of hackers in this game, to the point where you can be merily sauntering around the swamps of the game map, and then suddenly completely out of the blue be shot from across the entire bloody map by a person that can not and should not be able to see you. This literally makes the game unplayable at certain times and destroys the immersion.GLITCHES AND BUGS EVERYWHERE! Many a time have I had super gear and then found myself falling quite ridiculously into a non existant hole in a highway, only to get stuck and either drown in inivisible water or just have to walk around aimlessly in a trap hole. Not really what I imagined for a post apocalyptic death scenario. The map is huge, and this is not a negative. In fact I think the map is brilliant, the choice of either open fields of death or narrow streets and high rise buildings to be sniped from. These elements add a real sense of fear to the game and I believe that is what makes me keep playing the game. The PVP aspect, oh god I hate this bit. Unless you intend to play with a group of over 5 bazillion people, don't bother trying to be friendly or nice to other players. They will gun you the f*** down without a moments hesitation, steal all your stuff and then get shot themselves by someone watching from a far off place. PVP sucks in this game, and even with friends, you aren't safe. BUT, credit where credit is due, this again adds a serious fear element which I can really appreciate, a proper struggle for survival in a world where no one gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥what you do. The AI monsters (or nethers) are pretty f****** scary, and when you encounter the wrong type, wow can you be killed quick! They are exactly what they should be, something to avoid rather than something to attack. The benefit though is when you have the right gear to fight them, because then you can reap the rewards of your triumphant kill, sell off their body parts and make money or items haazah! That is of course, unless you get sniped by someone 5 miles away....Servers is my last issue now, seeing as when I started playing this game, to even get to the server screen was awful. You had to wait over 15 minutes just for the main menu screen to load! But now I look back fondly at this time because at least back then there were servers! Now you are handed a pathetically small list of servers, of which the main ones are the god awful new gamemode last man standing (don't ask). SO if you want to actually play this game, I wish you luck trying to find a bloody server to play on.... Okay so that is pretty much all I have to say, I wish it wasn't so negative because I am still adamant this game has massive potential, and it really is a shame that it was released in such a s*** state, because I do enjoy it. YES! Despite all the terrile bugs and the terrible gameplay, and the not so great textures, it is still a fun game. Why you ask? Because in its errors and faults, there is a weird charm that just makes me keep playing it. And yes I cry and damn near wreck my room when I've spent 3 years trying to get this one gun and then suddenly *SNIPE* and all my progress is gone, but that just makes it all the more challenging, fighting for survival in a world where you start off as an underdog and remain that way for the entirety of the rest of the game! So my advice to you potential player, don't go into this game with high expectations, because it won't meet them, but rather see this game as a continuous work in progress, or even as a very human version of an apocalypse. My reason for the ""No"" recommendation? Merely because I am hoping if enough people downvote this game they may actually fix it, and then we can all go about sniping each other legitimately!			"

Game is clearly broken they make ZERO progress in fixing it and or making it playable. I BEG you NOT to buy this game or further endorse it.~LeMasters			"

												TL;DR version- Scam... Terrible customer service, waited 16 days for a reply, so much fail with programing of game and website it was litterally (yes litterally) unplayable. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY DAYZ OR RUSTI bought the Chosen Package back when it was $50+ but never actually got to play the game. Bought it, made an account, logged in to register account and link it to steam to find their servers were down.  Tried the next day and could not log into my account or the game, tried to remake the account and said my email was in use. Turns out that you need to log in, to click a button to have them send a verification email to you. With being unable to access my account, no amount of reset password ever sent me an email. I contacted their customer service in less than 24 hours of having bought the game. I waited 16 days before they ever sent a reply, which read as follows ""Sorry we didn't get back to you sooner"" No addressing the issues I had, or comments as to if any action was being taken to fix the problems. so I replied and after another 4 days they replied asking me to make sure my internet connection was working properly. I had to ask for a level two tech support engineer, which gave me a list of things to try. Most of them I had tried and half of them required me to log into their website to manage my account. When I sent a reply telling them I had been unable to log into my account on NEITHER the website NOR the game, they replied to please log into the website to change my settings. They made it clear in 40 days that they had my money and didn't care that I was unable to actually use any content.			"

This review was made after the recent Nether update 10.28.2015.I love this game, even though the mechanics of the game is similar in a way to H1Z1 and DayZ, this one is more of a unique one. The world design, lighting, environment is great.And now since Phosphor Games is back developing Nether, I can't wait what they will bring to Nether now as they removed microtransactions, Nether is no longer P2W! I hope Phosphor Games continue to develop this game and turn it to a better game in the future.			"

												***Warning to all Oceanic Players***All Oceanic servers are gone. I attempted to ask if we can expect them back at some point however I received no reply after 3 attempts. If you purchase this game be aware of the following:- Only EU and US servers- The game seems to update every 7 months now- The game is worthy of Beta stage but consider it complete- Months ago the community manager vanished and majority of the development team leftThe overall game is fun! The concept of DayZ but more action and less simulation, especially with the all unwordly creatures you will be facing more often than Humans. I have enjoyed playing the game for a number of hours but I'm frustrated about the removal of aussie servers and now I canno't even play the game without 300+ ping.This is a game you may keep saying ""Boy this game does have potential"" but your hopes gradually dimishes until your dissapointment takes over and you begin to hate it.

In those server 90% of the player wanna kill you because you are lvl 31 and got some epic stuff3. No PvE server4. Spawns kills5. Loots are always the same, only luck will give you weapons6. If Server aren't full, it's because you can't connect7. SO MUCH F%&@# CRASH DAMNIT8. If you fid a nice looting zone, there is a moth*****er behind you9. If you walk more than 20 min without being shoot at, it's because the player that tried to kill you got killed by another one, keep running the other one is following you10. If you get out of a safezone when tere is more than 20 player in the server, RUN ♥♥♥♥♥ RUN, or you gonna get spawn kill11. When you first play, good player give you stuff and there friends, bad player, kill you and give it back  to his friend, the loop restart12. Did you said buggy?

												Don't buy this game. It's a broken, buggy, confusing mess of disparate elements, hastily cobbled together with little thought, ugly mechanics obscured with pretty graphics and buzz-words like ""sandbox"" and ""hardcore survival"" thrown around to lure in the unwary.Pros:- This is a good-looking game, at least from a distance.- It sports a fairly large game world which feels lived-in and real.- Excellent atmosphere replete with background noise, harsh wind and insect buzzing. It pulls off that desolate post-apocalyptic feel better than any game I can think of besides Metro 2033 and Last Light.- Good overall sound designCons:- It's poorly optimized and chokes even the highest-end PC's and lowering the video settings to minimum doesn't help much. It tries to compensate by un-rendering many props at a ridiculously short distance. - Confusing everything. You get a ""tutorial mission"" the first time you play, which explains a few things, but not nearly enough of essential info. Hours into the game, I still didn't know what I was doing. Something's wrong when you don't explain why there are invincible, immobile enemies spawned in clusters throughout the world.- Enemy encounters are surprisingly rare outside of periodically attacked outposts. That said, when you do encounter more than 1 or 2, you can be killed within seconds. Because AI pathfinding is hard, the enemies always teleport behind you, and warp away when attacked because they're also dumb as rocks, so the devs had to make them as cheap as possible so that they wouldn't be just cannon fodder.- NPC traders only accept specific combinations of items, so you're stuck lugging around meaningless junk for much of the game.- Randomly generated ""quest"" system which is nothing but deliver box A to shop B. This wouldn't be so bad if getting around in this game didn't take an eternity. Oh, and of course they have weight values and clog up your initially tiny inventory. Also, each random quest box can only be turned in at one NPC. This is literally the most half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥""quest"" system I've ever seen in a game.- What makes this worse is you lose everything when you die. That's fine for players who want to feel super hardcore and macho, but that's going to turn off a ton of new players who aren't even given a chance to get comfortable with the mechanics.- Random health pickups strewn throughout the world aren't enough to keep you alive and health regenerates excruciatingly slowly.- Only a handful of servers, usually just one per game mode and region, most of which seem buggy as hell.- Unwieldy, confusing UI. No way to track other players or friends... unless they have to join your tribe first, and in that case, F that.- This game seems to have been either abandoned by its developer or they just don't care. Controller support has been broken for months, private servers were promised since the beginning and still haven't surfaced, hackers are running rampant and unchallenged, etc. Apparently, they can't even do something as simple as send a forgotten password email... 3 times. I just happened to remember mine or I'd be SOL.			"

Early Access Review
								EDITEDIT: This review is based off of how Nether was on release (before January). I don't intend to revisit Nether. I did not enjoy my initial experience and (from what I can see) things have changed, but the game itself hasn't met anything I wanted it to. I recommend you look into various sources before you buy this game.EDIT: In light of certain comments, let me make a few things clear:- Yes, I realize this is Early Access. I say so at the very beginning. No, that does not mean a game that is -SELLING- is immune to criticism. Early Access or not, this is a product that people are capable of purchasing. Therefore, we are free to offer our take on whether or not we recommend it -- and I don't.That being said, to everyone: Please, take my review with a grain of salt. Feel free to investigate anything I say on your own. Make your own conclusions.- While it looks like my playtime is insufficient to make any judgments on the game, I can assure you the amount of time I spent was enough to confidently state the points I made.- Given that this is Early Access, this review -MAY- change drastically, or even be removed if the points I had an issue with are fixed/addressed. I'm not here to nab popularity votes or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ the only intention of this review is to warn people who are expecting more than this game can currently provide.- My opinion might differ from yours. Simply pointing out it's an opinion doesn't negate♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's entirely possible that you enjoy the game as is, and if you do, more power to you. However, that doesn't mean I am wrong to think otherwise, nor does it mean anyone who agrees is also wrong.- If a recent patch fixes any of the issues and I haven't adjusted my review, please let me know in a comment. It is possible (and likely) that I am not aware yet.Original Review Below:========================================================================Let me start out by saying that the game isn't bad. It's a great concept, and it looks pretty great. Further, the game is still in Beta, so don't view the game -too- harshly.But it has a long way to go before it's worth buying.1. Too much emphasis on PvP, to where ultimately the game feels like a chore to play. It's impossible to rally any sort of human cooperation a majority of the time, which while fine in a game like DayZ, is a serious flaw in a game like Nether (where safe areas have to be defended and survival typically is best in groups). I'd suggest making two (or more) seperate teams/groups, of which the player has to choose from on character creation and cannot change unless they rejoin the server. One is the ""survivor"" group, in which members of the group cannot hurt other members, and people inside gain exp boost (or some other form of incentive [maybe hunger slows down?]). The other group is the bandits, which is the free-for-all side of the game, offering no incentive beside being able to hunt whoever they want. The two groups should be easily distinguishable. 2. Safe areas are not safe. People often camp the entrance of a safe haven and shoot anyone approaching. The ideal solution is extending the area of safe havens and giving combat a cooldown (10seconds?) upon exit.3. The level system feels pointless, as it resets after every death. It should be account bound, much like how gold-items are. Or removed. Either way, as it stands, there is no reason to level up.4. Collision issues are everywhere. Crouching often gets you stuck on objects, especially while on a roof.5. Name tags are displayed when you hover over another person, which is a real big issue when trying to hide/avoid other people. This feature should either be removed or it should be changed to only display in extremely close encounters.These five issues, amongst numerous other glitches (gun delay, scenary bugs, etc), make the game not worthwhile yet. I hope to see these things changed very soon, so that it feels like playing the game is worthwhile.			"

												Short Version:This game sucks and I want my money back.Long Version:This game has a multitude of problems that are being paid no attention to despite the outcry on the forums to deal with said problems.  The developers have basically abandoned the game and left a small team to use it as their little playground as they release 'fixes' that don't fix anything we NEED fixed.  So many silly things that make this game either impossible or boring and just plainly rob you of your experience.Pros- You can be the exact thing you might very well be hunting in the games.(Golems, Watchers)ConsYeah, didn't see that coming, did you?  That was the only redeeming part of the game for me.Survivors- The 'About this Game' section is full of complete♥♥♥♥♥♥  There is no life-saving decision because there is no way to save your life.  The game is riddled with hackers that seem to go unnoticed by the developers.  This, combined with numerous bugs pertaining to weapons, stamina and the game's skill system make it impossible to play.- The servers are constantly down or screwed up beyond all relief.  There used to be between twenty to twenty-five servers, and now there's ten at the most with about three or four of them being US East and a similar number for US West-  One not monitored by Steam VAC [which doesn't work with Nether by the way] in each category.  There's currently a bug going about that makes it impossible to join servers.  You click to join, it loads you in, then sends you back to the server select screen.- None of the weapons are balanced in any way and all of them can kill you in a few meager hits, or even one.  The game's enemies- the Nether -pose absolutely NO threat unless you try to intentionally get them after you by running into screamers,  hordes lead by reapers or dropzones.  Otherwise, there's barely ANY Nether around and they can be killed so easily that it's not even funny.  It may take a bit, but odds are you'll leave unscathed if you follow the basic tactic of [W], [Mouse 1], [S].- The game is VERY Pay-2-play.  Some may disagree but your Nether Gold can be used to buy weapons, food, ammo and Nether Potions which allow you to turn into weak Nether that die far too easily.- The only vehicles in the game don't work and actually explode or fly into the air on you if you try to get in them.  I know this from experience, and it was a painful experience.- As expected, the only people who you can really trust in that game are the people on your friend's list in Steam who you probably knew before you bought this trainwreck.  Tribes mean nothing and hold no value as tribemembers will still gladly slaughter other tribemembers- even during location takeovers so their negativity with their tribe is entirely abolished once they capture it and make it out with your hard-earned items.- Spawn locations for weapons and ammo aren't too far in between as a shotgun can be just a few steps away from an SMG or sword that does about 225 damage per swing, not including the game's skills.- Hitboxes in this game are VERY poor, as well as the weapon system.  Instead of a simple animation to slightly lean in to focus your aim, the game immediately changes your field of view, forces your perspective forward and puts the sight of the gun directly into your face in the course of a millisecond.- Safezones can be attacked, and disabled for up to an HOUR unless players can band together to reactivate anti-Nether arrays in the safezone.  People often hide in buildings around the safezones, an example being Lakeside, the biggest and most common safezone, and snipe down at anyone who walks in.  Even if they killed you once, they will continue to kill you until you give up.  This makes the game unfun and unfair.- Medpacks and energy boost items can be hotkeyed, but they have absolutely no cooldown.  You can keep downing pills in the midst of battle.Nether- To be a Golem or Watcher, you have to pay in the game's 'funbucks'.  You can pay with in-game money, but it costs $1,250 just to be a Crawler Nether- only 1250 HP with about 125 damage output.  You can also get a single one from completing the beginner tutorial.  You only get three lives and do minimal damage whereas the human survivors get weapons that do up to five-hundred damage per shot.  That's six shots to end your life just for you to spawn miles away from the actual players.  You slowly die if you don't kill anyone to refill your food bar and have minimum damage output so this makes it impossible to do properly.- As a Nether, you can get caught in a LOT of things in this game, especially the stairs.  Trying to go up them often results in you being trapped in the stairs, and unable to move.  While it is possible to get out, it's still ridiculous how traversing stairs seems to be impossible.- As a Nether, when you teleport, your physical entity is still above ground.  If you disappear and move around- you can still be killed by spray-pray.- As a Nether, if you go to an outpost currently under attack and wait there until the outpost is secured, you can keep the Outpost in an 'attacked' state.  Players may fire, Nether may still enter, but not spawn inside, and as long as YOU are within the Safezone as a Nether, it will remain this way, whether you're shooting or not.NoteI just wanna throw this out there as well.  I bought the Chosen edition-  When it was $40, thinking I was about to have one of the best experiences of my life.  A week later, the price dropped and the game was still total♥♥♥♥♥♥  The developers don't try to talk to the community or interact, they just do what they want.  Even as I typed this, they've released a DLC that forces you to fight other players, something that already happens day to day in the game if you can even get into it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers.  I guess I should have expected this coming from guys who make mobile games chock-full of pay-to-play bonus♥♥♥♥♥♥that's similar to Farmville or Candy Crush.  On their website and even their Twitter, there is nothing about Nether, only 'WARP', their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 6v6 mobile-MOBA.  Nether so much potential and I can definitely see it going somewhere, but with the people working on it as it is who seem to think they can scrape by the bottom of the boat with such horrendous features running it, it's doomed to die and may have already died.

THAT ♥♥♥♥ IS WORSE THAN IN DOTA 2.-HACKERS DO NOT GET PUNISHED FOR HACKING IN THIS GAME.-Zero support.-Zero bug fixing.-Zero display of moderating in-game whatsoever.HONEST RATING BY AN HONEST CUSTOMER:-Graphics: 7/10-Gameplay: 1/10-HUD/Interface friendliness: 4/10-Support: 0/10Overall: 3/10. Not even trying to be a Steam game. Why has GaybeN still not wiped Nether off Steam.P.S.: When overPVPers start getting banned, that's when Gameplay will be improved. BAN THE PVPERS. BAN THE F*CKING KIDS. SINCERELY, EVERYONE WHO DOESN'T WANT TO START OVER EVERY ONE HOUR EVER. Or implement a way to SAVE inventory and/or EXP gained.EDIT: FINALLY, THERE HAS BEEN SOME PUNISHMENT OF THE HACKERS, THERE'RE PVE SERVER AND, Ω ΘΕΕ!!!, THERE HAS BEEN A PATCH!!! I believe the patch was 5 months ago when I last paid this game a visit, only to find the new bug/hack exploit with the neg keys.Still not recommended to buy but, some improvement has been finally made.KEEP IT UP, NETHER TEAM. At this rate, maybe in 2 or 3 years, it will be a game decent enough to purchase. Until then, either f2p or gtfo.			"

												**EDIT: I really don't like this game just yet, but I absolutely love the developers. They're really nice and friendly. Hope they fix this game.**DOUBLE EDIT: There are have been significant updates to the game since my review, and most of these issues have been reportedly fixed, but I don't think I have it in me to play this game again. This review is strictly for January and before.**TRIPLE EDIT: My review is no longer relevant, as I've seen about 5gb worth of updates since the last time I played. I may pick it up again in the future, but I'm too jarred from my previous experiences with the game. If you plan on buying this game, please put a lot of consideration into it. You may very well be disappointed with it, as I was.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like every other survival MMO, great concept, poor execution. The community is worse than the DayZ community. In my 4 hours, I've died at least 15 times.Allow me to recap all I can remember.-First spawn. Walked around for 10 minutes. Got sucked into the atmosphere. I was geniunely enjoying sneaking around these empty buildings. I saw a guy, but he hadn't seen me. He had no weapon, he was a new spawn like me. I chased him and tried to introduce myself, we both got shot from no where.-Second spawn, open up the map, start heading towards safe zone. Get shot within 30 seconds.-Spawn. I'm at a beach. Pretty cool. I go to the end of the warf and jump into the water, only to find that instead of swimming, I plummet to the ocean floor and die.-Spawn. Started heading towards the safe zone. Cross a bridge, get shot at, narrowly escape, head further towards it, get shot by someone else.-Spawn. Finally make it to a safe zone. Get shot just before I can enter.-Spawn. Finally have my first encounter with the Nether. There's four of them, I kill one or two before they kill me. (Finally a fair death).-Spawn facing another newspawn. ""Hello?"" I ask in my best 'Please for the love of god give me a ♥♥♥♥ing break' voice, he starts stabbing me with his knife. I can no longer take it. I let him kill me and take a few days away from this game.I come back a week later.-Spawn with only 550 health for some reason. Climb up a three story building. Check the roof, there's no loot, I glitch off and fall to my death.-Spawn. Sneak through some buildings, find a hatchet in the back of a big truck, my very first piece of loot! Things are finally looking up!. I crawl in going as slow as I can. Hear a growl. I figure 'he can't hear or see me, I should be fine'. Turn around, some giant ♥♥♥♥er teleports in and smashes me to death.-Spawn. There's a giant cool building in right in front of me. ""Sweet! This is gonna be-"" I get sniped within a few seconds of spawning.A few weeks pass. -Spawn. ""Hey dude."" I hear some guy say, I scramble for the P2T button, but I can't remember it. I turn around, he shoots me.-Spawn. I walk to an alley for a moment before I tab out, google the VOIP button, and then tab back in and I see a person with a gun just looking at me, as if inspecting me. I say ""Hey dude!"" He replies with ""Yo."". Finally, a friend!We walk together for a few moments, he asks me how new I am, I tell him I'm brand new since the only thing I've ever done is get shot. He tells me it's a bit harsh, and he explains how he's among the top of the leaderboards for something, though I can barely understand him since the VOIP is so laggy.After a moment, we come across a subway access stair case. We venture down, hooray! I'm actually exploring and having fun with a stranger I've found! We walk through the subway tunnels. We're attacked by four or five monsters all up, but together with team work we make short work of them. Haha! I'm on top of the world! We find the exit to the subway, and as I venture up, I spot a shotgun. I pick it up. 6 bullets. That's enough to-Suddenly I hear shooting! Oh no, we're under attack! My friend covers one entrance to the subway while I cover the other. He's shooting, I look over and to my dismay, he's been killed! No, my only friend! You ♥♥♥♥ers! I sprint over to his body, set myself up tactically, and as one of them moves in I blow him away (miraculously, as when I try to shoot there's a one second delay). I look back up to the only other entrance, and then bam! A spray of bullets. I'm dead. A completely different player had come the way we came, and killed me.So that's it. Those are my Nether experiences. Beta or not, this game is nothing but frustration. It's going to take a lot for me to ever want to play this game again.			"

Early Access Review
								Ugh, I really wanted to like this game but I just don't really enjoy it that much.There's no sense of a goal or cooperation or anything, you just kind of run around and pick up guns and maybe level up a couple times until the horrifying creatures of the world destroy you. There's really nothing to do except kill things and level up slowly. Sometimes I get shot from somewhere and boom I'm dead, all that progress is gone...You're supposed to defend certain points or something but nobody ever does? I guess people are too scared of each other (and for good reason.) What's the point to all this?It's a very pretty game and much easier to play than something like DayZ but there's only a few hundred people playing at any given time. I still have a glimmer of hope that this is just because the game is still being developed but I can't recommend this game in its current state.			"

												At first, it looked great. At the time of release, it was a step off the beaten path for the open-world apocalypse survival game- everyone was trying to make cash cow zombie survival games due to the success of the DayZ mod, and this was not a survival game. It had a fair amount of fun moments, and the ambiance was great for its time. Hearing the scream of yet another new monstrocity finding some poor, unprepared soul (sometimes you!) was mortifying. There was a basic, yet functional MMO-style leveling system in-game, which actually generally seemed to work out and added meaning to your deaths. I didn't even mind the ""shoot on sight"" mentality that the game provoked- every game that has guns and no true repercussions for shooting and killing other players will have that. The microtransaction system was very worrying, and really should never have been part of the game, but as that appears to have been ironed out of the game in the Resurrected release I'll leave that untouched. The game had a lot of small issues, but those could have eventually been ironed out with some love and care from the development team.The problem is, they weren't.The development team saw the money they'd recieved, the potential to exploit the market, and the amount of work that'd have to go in to fixing it. They saw tons of people cheating and ruining the gameplay experience. But they didn't opt to put in the work to fix the problems mentioned before. Eventually, the game simply died.But then Phosphor ""Resurrected"" the game by making it pay-to-play and adding offline and private servers. They claimed ""Now the game will never die!"" But they didn't actually want to update the game, to allow it to reach its full untapped potential from when it was first announced. The game was abandoned immediately after, just like so long ago. Phosphor had other plans- to go on and release The Brookhaven Experiment, tapping into the VR market while they had the chance.They didn't use the previous ""Phosphor Games Studio"" link on this page to publish that game, and for good reason.This game is basically The War Z(Also known by Infestation: Survivor Stories), but the game, concept and its prospects were actually good.

												Edit 2016: Still dead, still no updates...........   Still charging people for an unfinished dead game .Edit: May 2015I'm amazed that STEAM didn't take this title out of the store.The launcher is broken for some people, they are making fake updates just to show that they are still working on the title, when is clear that the game was abandoned months ago.Players are asking refunds and to take this title out of STEAM.Edit: february 2015The game was clearly abandoned.There is no way to contact the team behind the game, especially some  people buying the game now can't activate the product and they are screwed.Steam should take this game away, right now is up on the store just to steal some money to unaware people.EDIT: November 2014-----The game seems to be abbandoned.   Just 5 servers still up, no words fro the new DEV team, no more hope.  ;(NEW EDIT: MONTHS AFTER THE FUL RELEASE----------------The game still broken, can't map all controls, there are less and less servers, hackers, almost nothing changed from alpha stage, .... all the hope about this game getting better is gone. As a lot of people said when was in alpha, this game is nothing more than warz 0.2   :  just another unfinished mess to try to make money from players looking for a good open world survivor game.-----------------------EDIT : REVIEW  AFTER THE FULL RELEASE-----------------------------This game feels like an Alpha, run like and Alpha and didn't change too much in 9 months.- key mapping is not complete (just some keys can be changed, to know what the rest of the keys do, you have to search in the forum for clues)- To change settings (controlls, video, audio) you have to connect to a server !!!!!  I'm serious - Server browser don't show the servers ping or location (lag, desync, ecc ecc) and sometimes freeze the entire game.- This is a huge pvp map, the Npc creatures are done well but the melee combact doens't feel smooth at all, the firearms action can be fun.- Character animations are the same from alpha, they need a lot of work. (other players are actually fun to watch moving around the map). - Characters costumization: almost none, some clothes and mask and they all looks terrible.- bugs, bugs and more bugs (ex: invisible walls where the map isn't finished)- Hackers, (due to the impossibility to see the server ping sometimes they are not hackers just people desynching so badly that you see them flying, passing trough walls , ecc ecc). - The atmosphere of the game at least is good, I love the big teleporting monsters called Nethers.It's a shame, this game could have been so good but I don't see it going in other directions than a big death match map.- The new way to find stuff by always open boxes, cases, it's really done bad.After more than 9 months of developpment the game still the same buggy, unfinished mess that was on alpha. Unfortunally, the DEV team behind this game can't deliver simple basilar mechanics like a normal server browser or full keymapping, so I don't think that they can do anything better with the actual game. There are some good ideas behind this product, but the execution is just not acceptable.edit: Good news everyone!!!!    Now they are addings keys that you can buy with real money to open box inside the game to have good loot!    You can even play as a Nether, guess what? to do this you have to buy a potion on the store or buy a key to open a gold box that may have that postion... smooth!!!			"

												Let me get one thing clear: I have 1000+ games, played a lot of them ... I'm a sucker for survival games. THIS TITLE IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER PLAYED. I mean, I payed 2,79€ and I am sorry for every cent. This game is so bad that I can't even describe it. Let me break down this for you: you will wait FOR THE SERVER LIST to load aprox. 10-15 minutes and I'm not kidding (me and my friend tested this with 6Gb of ram and 24 Gb) - same loading time. Then after you get to choose a server you will find a broken game, a mess, poor textures (not even close to the ones in screenshots or trailer), and a world where nothing happens aside PVP. I will say it again - I REGRET THAT I SPENT 2,79€ on this crap. If you consider yourself a gamer STAY AWAY FROM THIS TITLE. 2/10 (for the trailers).			"

I had only a knife. I fought long and hard for survival but I died several times. After a while I had gathered alot of guns. And I mean ALOT. My whole storage was full of different ones. Some I had crafted, some I had traded and some I had found. Now that is when the fun started. Knowing that I could take out a gun and, even if I died, i would have another one I started doing daring stuff. Teamed up with equally good players. Had alot of fun. I still remember this game as a fun, immersiveand beautiful. I had a great time. Then came the dark times.The games development was taken over by some other studio that I don't remember the name of. They implemented a system that allowed players to pay real money for in-game gold. Basicly you had to pay to have fun. I still played tho. With my armory of guns I continoued to have fun for a while. Heck I even paid a bit myself. But after a while everyone had better gear than me and I was killed over and over and over again. Me, not wanting to use alot of money on a game that I'd already bought, played less and less and less. Untill I played nothing at all. Started playing other similar games. (out of which Miscreated is the best one, which I recommend). The game is uninstalled to clear space and about a year later I think back to the good old days playing Nether. I think ""Maybe I should check it out again. Maybe it's changed"". So I research and it turns out. Phosphor (the original developers) are back working on Nether. They remove the in-game purchases, and everything was looking brighter. I download and launch. The game runs♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can't even tell you how bad it runs. At the lowest settings it was unplayable. I was trying with the same computer that could run medium to high without problems a year and a half ago. I don't know what happened but I'll say this: If you don't have a good PC you should not buy this game. Not in the state that it's in. My PC specs are Ok. I have a ASUS GeForce GTX 660 ti which, as I mentioned: Ran the game at medium to high before.To sum it up: I'll give the game a 7/10... one and a half year ago.2/10 when it had other developers (pay to win)and 4/10 now. It's unplayable for medicore computers.			"

 DO NOT BUY THIS GAME  This kind of abominably-programmed game won't even allow you to log-in. I've also tried with new launchers, but nothing.And if you log-in you don't know how and when you will spawn, and you will probably see yourself flying around the map.With Steam sales you can buy this game for about 3€, but please:  DON'T DO IT,  there are a lot of better games. Buy ARMA 2 and play it with the DayZ mod... it's a little buggy, but at least you can play and have fun.			"

												Another early access that pretty much turned into a scam.   Don't let this ""revival"" make you think that it's fixed and worth playing.  They just did this to try and make some quick money before they bail, again.   Don't buy it, even if it's on sale.  It's not worth it.   These are the kind of developers that shouldn't be allowed on steam.			"

												Can't even make it to the game, it just loops at ""Would you like to link your Steam account to your Mber account? This is required if you bought your game via Steam."" Pretty sure I bought a log-in simulator 2014. 0/10 for survival game. 11/10 for log-in simulation. Great release! Edit: Managed to get past the log in screen ^^   @Sneeker I don't expect a game to be perfect on release but I expect a fully released game to not freeze at the server list for over 10 minutes, and after getting into a server I have to fly around in spectator for another good 10 minutes in order to spawn. The game has so many problems at the moment I can't consider it out of beta. I play with a squad of friends and not a single one of them haven't experienced a crash or freeze, when a game is considered a full release the MAJORITY of players should not be experiencing such problems. Gameplay wise I don't mind the developer's hardcore style of survival. I love the thrill of getting safe zone camped by players or raided by nethers. It's ok to lose all my items and levels when I die as a punishment for getting killed, this aspect of the game creates an early to mid to late game feel giving the game a great degree of replay value. The idea is great but was executed poorly, I constantly find myself clipping through solid objects, taking fall damage for no reason as the rock I hopped on is apparently a sprite and I fell right through it. This review isn't for people who have already bought the game and managed to get in and enjoy it. It's for buyers who are deciding whether or not to purchase an enjoyable experience, and I don't think it's ready yet. All of my buddies agree that the game feels lacking and we would have a better exoerience when it is ""done"". It should have stayed as an early access game until all of these problems are fixed.Game 10/10Horror 10/10Design 10/10Execution 1/11			"

												Nether had one job: to make a survival game that wasn't as bad as The WarZ, both in terms of gameplay and business practices. Sounds easy, all one had to do was not release a game long before it was finished and stay out of stuff such as microtransactions to unlock exclusive content for a paid game. Unfortunately, Nether failed in both aspects, and in my two minutes of actually playing the game (the rest were trying to get the game to run in the first place), I regret spending $3 USD for this garbage.Nether had a lot of promise, a load of ideas that sounded like a solid plan, such as quest moments to really get players to aggro to one area and make things more exciting, and enemies apart from zombies. But none of these ideas come to light, thanks to being greeted by microtransactions from the get-go, cosmetic or otherwise, game breaking bugs like being stuck in a spectator mode which isn't even part of the game, the random moments where you're not capable of swimming despite it supposedly being possible (and roughly 50% of the game world is covered in deep water with no bridges), and moments where characters spontaneously die.I have no idea what game the official reviews were playing, but if it was Nether, then I'm going to hazard a guess and assume they were paid for those results. Heck, one review even opens up how great Phosphor Games is.Nether has one thing going for it, and that's much nicer visuals than either DayZ or The WarZ, but that's as far as it goes. All in all, the game is basically a spiritual sequel to The WarZ, and it's made readily apparent from the moment you launch the game. Save your three bucks and buy yourself something better, like cheap coffee.			"

												While Nether would have gotten a negative review from me 2 weeks ago, since they've started banning hackers the game has drastically improved going from 'dam he had an aimbot'  over to 'my aim was better'. While the game does have a decent learning curve if your not used to this genre, it becomes really fun once you learn how the Nether world works finding weapons, food, and ammo, as well as dispatching most nether's with ease. Would recommend if you have a friend that can play with you, and if not solo is still pretty damn fun!If you do read any reviews for this game, make sure they are november 2014 or newer, thats when bans started~			"

												I played this game passionately - have a look at my playtime. Me and my friends went through very good and bad times, went throughout heights and depths, I went through love and hate for myself and my opponents. The atmosphere and idea of this game is great and unique. In my opinion the base game uniqueness is absolutely unrivaled.But there is one flaw, an essential one for a survival game: Cheaters. Nether was infested from the beginning of my era and it only has gotten worse and worse. There never was and still not is any effective cheat detection or protection in this game.A game that could be extremely addictive and fun, intense solo or with friends, able to pull out the most multifarious feelings out of your synapses - suddenly turns into the complete opposite.For me as a “veteran” of Nether it feels like the developers were parents that gave their own beloved child heroin as a 13th birthday present and then sitting down and watch it passing away.Just. Nothing. Left. To. Enjoy. Here. "

Early Access Review
								Here's what you get for $29.99: A game where everyone kills everyone because there's no incentive to work together. You also get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ collision issues (ie. crouch down and get stuck on a semi-trailer... even though there's plenty of room to move away from it) coupled with no real reason to even level, because when you die, it's gone- along with your items (which are horribly overpriced in a permadeath game). On top of that, you can play ""lets-find-everything-but-a-gun"" for 45 min straight, and then get killed by some guy on a roof with a sniper rifle... real fun right? You also get hungry, but you might as well just die and reset because food is overpriced too, along with healing supplies. A relatable experience is going to a Walmart on black friday with made-up monsters lurking around: Everyone wants to kill you, the monsters want to kill you, and all the good♥♥♥♥♥♥is no where to be found. I really wish this style of survival horror would evolve into something more enjoyable than this, because it has a lot of potential to be something addicting.UPDATE: I've already uninstalled this game. What a waste of money.			"

												I know many people love this game. So you all can downvote this negative review but it doesn’t change my opinion about it… I have always written honest reviews and so I do now!Genre: Nether is a first person survival shooter game.My FIRST DAYS with this game: First day I tried to play this game I had to register an account for Nether… That was bothersome but okay… (By the way the small box with “Remember me” seems not to work because I always have to fill it in again.)Alright I was ready to play then but the game just crashed. I saw a white screen and wasn’t able to close the game. Even ALT+F4, ALT+TAB and Taskmanager haven’t worked… So I had to restart my computer what really wasn’t funny anymore. Same happened 3 times. So I decided to try it another day maybe…My NEXT DAYS with this game: One week later… I tried the game again and YEAH HELL NO WHITE SCREEN! I was so happy to see something. But my happiness went into sadness when I joined a server and crashed after 1 minute back to the desktop. With the Error “Nether has a problem”. Yeah I see… Nether has a problem. <.<Alright, alright… I don’t wanted to give up so I closed the game and started it again. I see the servers, join one and this time I see a blackscreen… This diversification is really amazing. :cUff.. Then I saw something – DRUM ROLL – ………………………………..the server list again. :> Wait… wasn’t I connecting to a server? Hmmm… okay.. let’s do it again. We try another server.♥♥♥♥… I ended again in the serverlist. Alright NEXT SERVER…. serverlist again. I tried this with 10 servers then I closed the game again. ♥♥♥♥ it!TODAY:Today I was really, really lucky. I had the glory to REALLY PLAY this game. Yay!And and and… wait what is this? This looks terrible… The graphic is a brashness not more. I would give the graphic 2/10 points. But just if they pay for the headache pills I had to take. ;(I have to mention that I sometimes get an headache when I play a game with a really terrible graphic (I think there have been 4 games which were able to do that from my 350 games =D). I still don’t wanted to give up so I played it for a while. In the safezone I wanted to look for the map first (where I have to go and what I maybe have to do). So I jumped into the cargo area of a truck and opened the menu. After seeing where I have to go and finishing my settings I met some amazing players. <3 “Oh HI MY FRIEND!”… “Uhm could you make a step backwards that I can leave the truck?”… “Uhm.. no?”… “Oh great… yeah blind me with your ♥♥♥♥ing green light and don’t let me leave the truck… really funny”. 5 minutes later: I was able to leave the truck. <.< So I continued my way and left the safezone. I met my first enemies… some uhm.. what the ♥♥♥♥ are they? Teleporting aliens with no bones? They don’t even look a bit scary… urgh.. alright… killing one after the other I reached level 10. Walking always straight on (pressing 30 minutes the W-button.. yay… funny) I met players from time to time… who were not much different to the creatures. They also looked bad ( the 3 human characters look really similar and the girl has no hair... <3) and like the creatures the humans also tried to kill me. Good thing they had such a terrible aim that I killed them.. okay I just killed one.. the other players were  running away. Hmm so following them? Urgh ♥♥♥♥ no.. I want to ♥♥♥♥ing see something in this game… Sometimes I asked myself why I have to hold the picking up button for so long to get my drops… even in reality it doesn’t take so long to do this. O: Especially when there are 3 things on the ground and I want all…… I don’t even know why I want those bones and blood… Because I haven’t got any instruction into this game. :3 Hmm so my travel through this buggy and laggy world was kinda boring… so boring that I sometimes wanted to commit suicide. I really tried… but my jump was so buggy that I saw everything dangle for 10 seconds and found myself back on the position from where I jumped… Great. Alright God wants me to play further this game. After 10 minutes pressing the W-Button (for walking straight on) again I was still alive, still bored, still had an headache and burning eyes… and yea I gave up. I just opened menu and pressed EXIT… like PLEASE LET ME GO! Q.QConclusion:I really regret that I have bought this game. ;( At least for now… I MAYBE try this game again… but some months later. MAYBE they need some months to make this “Early Access Game” to a game. Or WAIT! This isn’t an “Early Access Game”? Why the hell… WHY?!(Add: Even if it was Early Access for a short while it isn't E.A. in the shop anymore and still full of errors.)Date of Review: 4th July 2014			"

This will and always be my favourite and most memorable game i have ever played. The developers should ever have left this game period. fixed it and stopped being babies about it.I actually get sad thinking about this game being not able to play.... :( since noone plays anymore "

Early Access Review
								I like the graphics of this game and how the developers build the world. Good price for items in stores. Diversified items and crafting. Yes it is a survival gaming experience. Actually it just like a death match mode. The feel when you spent more than 6 hours trying to survival, kill all those monster and then dead just because someone shooting you with a sniper and you don't even know where they are or get killed by a group of people or someone telling you that trust them and follow them and after that they kill you. And you lost everything, even level, skill tree. Start over with nothing, i mean you don't want to play anymore. The game still have many bugs, and i don't even know how the cars work, obviously the game still early access so it is fine. I'm really enjoyed when play this game but i hope it will be better than a deathmatch mode, no more bugs, hacking, in someday. Easy to find interesting at the beginning. You will get bored when you maximum level and weapon because there are nothing to do unless just to kill people and it being like CSGO or CoD no longer is a survial game.			"

												If you were looking to avoid the boring pointless tedium of games like Day Z or Rust, you're looking at the wrong game. Nether is basically just a heavy retooling of the same, tired, boring, unbalanced and unforgiving genre of ""survival"" concepts. There's little to no incentive to co-operate with other players therefore there's little point to survival. Treat each game more like a disposable burn session, there's no long-term here.All-in-all, if you're just in it for the mindless combat, trolling players or exploring a post-apocalyptic wasteland which resembles Chicago bordering Detroit with some of the crappiest suburbs in-between, then you might enjoy it just for that. Otherwise, don't expect any spectactular story, end-game or goal-driven gameplay. If the Enemy players or AI aren't trying to kill you, then don't worry. The surrounding environment will do a great job to make up for that as your character can't swim in waist-deep water and despite being above water will begin to drown or take damage anyway.If you're still not convinced then don't let the screenshots deceive you. Even at the highest quality settings, the game looks NOTHING like what you see in the screenshots or video. This game looks worse than Fallout 3 at the lowest settings even if you have the newest fanciest card. At one point this game did have promise and potential, however it doesn't appear to have lived up to any of it.			"

Early Access Review
								Nether is an amazing combination of spectacular post-apocalyptic survival, and very well put together First Person Combat. It does update rather often, so you need to be installing new things quite a bit, but honestly, the updates only make the game that much greater, so the updates are worth the wait. This is a strict Multiplayer only game, so if you don't have good enough internet to play online, I don't recommend getting it just yet. Multiplayer is quite amazing in this game, and really gives the player a more intense experience when exploring and surviving the world, because now you aren't just fighting mutants, you are also fighting real time players around the world. You can either team up with friends, or be a lone wolf, the choice is completely up to you. The graphics in this game are absolutely incredible, are give the game a whole new depth to surviving. The game features a full day to night system, moving water simulation, grass and tree movement, and actual structure movement in certain objects. The games graphics can be turned down if it is too much for a weaker computer, but if you have a beast computer, I definitely recommend playing this game in all it's glory, because it truly looks amazing.The gameplay mechanics in this game are also quite cool, such as the combat, movement, and interactions with other things. First off, the combat system is very well made, and gives players the choice of certain weapons they'd like to use. More of a close combat fighter? go with a deadly hatchet or a baseball bat. Want to snipe from atop a building? Find a sniper rifle to pick off your enemies, the combat choice is all up to you. The movement in this game is very nice and fluent, and has just the right amount of bobbing and motion blur, just enough to feel real, and not enough to annoy you, so it's very well balanced and playable. Interactions with other things is a very cool thing in this game. Finding random objects such as a sowing kit is actually important, even though it doesn't sound like it. You can find and interact with so many different items in the game, and it really gives the player a bigger survival feeling, instead of just having no hunger or thirst.Finally, the most important thing, this game is VERY fun. Games are not just about fancy guns and graphics, which this game has, it's about the fun in it. What's a game with no fun? I found myself staying up until three in the morning, running from monsters, and exploring the vast open world. There were many jump scare moments, and awesome fights. I realize that not everyone enjoys the same game, so that's why I'm about to put a conclusion of what kind of gamer would enjoy this game.This game is meant for the people who enjoy exploring an open world, with not any objective except for surviving. It's a First Person Shooter, which means you are seeing from the perspective of a man's eyes. This game is scary in a lot of ways, and can scare people who are not good with jump scares, or very ugly and scary monsters. This game is also violent, and has killing of mutated monsters, who spray blood when hit, and die in a pool of blood like goo, and also the killing of other humans, who will fall over when dead, but only drop their items, and not lay in a pool of blood. This game is also Multiplayer only, at the moment, and requires that you are online at all times, possibly on a server with no people, or on a server loaded with people, so you will, most likely, be playing with strangers most of the time on this game.I've had a lot of fun playing this game, and I hope a lot of other people will help support this game to help make it even better!

Early Access Review
								When I first bought this game I was scared that I had once again gave my money to an under experienced developer team but that changed quickly. The team over at Phosphor Games has got some great talent and I was actually amazed to see such great scenery, graphics textures, and lighting as soon as I entered a server. Altho the game is still in an ""Early Access"" state, It feels solid and runs great. The survival aspect has greatly been captured along with the feeling of being in a apocalyptic world. Almost every building or structure can be entered and searched for food, water, and weapons to help you survive against the dangers lurking around every corner. With the world being so vast with buildings to explore, it can become quite exhausting looting at times. The alien creatures know as The Nether were designed fantastically. They are somewhat difficult to fight and kill at first but once you get the hang of it, it becomes much easier. Altho you do not want to find yourself up against more than 2 or 3 them at a time as that can result in a very quick death with how much they teleport around you and even spit at you to block your vision. Stealth is definitely the way to go in this game. I found avoiding them completely made the game alot easier, especially at night time.As for the PvP in this game. I've only come across a few people and most were easy to kill if I had a gun of some sort. You do sometimes get your lone range camper who's window shopping the hotspots for guns waiting for someone to come walking by so they can get a cheap kill, just like you would any survival game though so watch your back entering military zones and popular spawn areas. The whole game is played in a first person view and I really hope it stays this way. I personally think 3rd person has ruined alot of other survival games with PvP combat in them. Aiming down the sights in this game may come off a bit different than other games giving that it has that ""Real"" feel to it. You will have to make up for gun sway and your stance you are in. Also as of now there are no hit markers to confirm to you that you have actually hit the person you have just shot at. You will have to have a good aim and patience to get the kills here. Unless of course its just some lvl 1 guy that spawned in with a kitchen knife right in front of you. Overall I highly recommend this game right now. It is one of my most played and most enjoyed. The developers also seem to have a great bond with the community about the game.			"

												Was this game good when it came out? Yes it was amazing. Did it show potential? Yes more so than war z and day z for a survival horror game. Is it worth paying attention to  now ? No its vaporware the devs are gone lights are off and the game is slowly dying with the long existing bugs holes and lack of any major longevity content here.  So you got my review now go find something actually worth your time. Nether has left the building and its husk is slowly decaying along with the other failed gaming ventures of once ambitous devs who said screw you guys we are going home.			"

								I admit I got suckered into spending money on this, and I very much wish I didn't. If you like looking at reptitious scenery with annoying background sounds while walking around wondering ""Gee, where the hell is everyone?"" This game is perfect for you!You'll come across very interesting items such as GUM and PLAYING CARDS while you slowly starve to death. Is that another player? Oh man finally! It's been so lo- *dead*.  The game should change it's name to BIG GIANT♥♥♥♥♥DEATHMATCH MAP WITH A COUPLE OF MONSTERS THAT ARE SPRINKLED AROUND WHERE EVERYONE WILL SHOOT YOUR♥♥♥♥♥ I mean seriously, don't waste time like I did the first time trying to make friends. Just shoot them and take their gum. Soon you'll have enough gum to make yourself a small crown, KING GUM OF THE WASTELANDS THEY WILL CALL YOU. THE BLOOD PIT OVERFLOWS WITH THE RED ICHOR OF YOUR ENEMIES. THE GUM CONSUMES ALL. YOU ARE DESTRUCTION INCARNATE. THEY ARE BUT MERE CHICLETS COMPARED TO YOU. YOU ARE SPEARMINTS CHOSEN, THE GODS CHOSEN CHAMPION. CHEW ENTIRE SUNS UNDER YOUR WELL TRAINED JAWS FROM CHEWING SO MUCH GUM. GOD DAMN YOU BEAST.but seriously this game is garbage go buy something better, like anything,(except infestation: survivor stories that game is like choking back your own fist)			"

												TL;DR: No. Whatever you are thinking, just no. ""What if it's on sale?"" NO! *slaps wallet out of hand*Its sad to see this game go down. I liked it, I really did. But everyone knows nowadays how these sort of games play out. First come out in early access, get updates constantly along with tons of players everyday enjoying the game. Then comes all the money and slowly seeing updates come less frequent until the game is completely abandoned BUT still on the steam marketplace so they can reap the developers can take the money of this trusting community. The creepy feeling entering the subway system for the first time was genuine but the how cheated and stolen from i feel from this game (and not so genuine developers) has made me not too trusting of any seemingly legit independant developers.

												This is the most broken, unplayable, stupid, early access EVER. The game was downloaded and I had to create some stupid other account for something. So I did that and launch the game. I quickly notice the game is at a rediculous resolution I would never use as default and cant change it. I saw no menus AT ALL just a list of the game servers. and even this part of the game was ruined, as I found the game freezing and I was having to wait several minutes before gaining any accessibility (the game also froze 3 times in this menu.) So I join the first server I see, I thought maybe it would get good from here on (I was wrong, so wrong) I join in the server expecting to be able to press esc and be flooded with valuable graphical options and other adjustments. I was again dissapointed. Esc did nothing. Like really. Nothing. So I hold ""w"" hoping I can walk forward, to find I am flying. I thought it was yet another bug so waited for a few minutes to see if it would resolve itself. Can you guess? It did not. I tryed to reinstall my game to see if it would fix it. But no. Nothing has changed. I cannot see why it is acceptable to release something so useless, and charge money for it. To summarise this I payed money to spectate a basic city with a poor resolution at a less than optimal framerate and a company whoring money from me and the community. Oh and on top of this I heard that this game has micro-transactions. And what is worse is that the devs will do almost nothing that inproves this, they can try but it will always be broken and bad. (I will never complain over dayZ again)			"

Early Access Review
								EDIT: This review originally was focused on the sole fact that the game was unplayable for the better part of last week due to a Steam / playnether sync error. Below is my updated review based on the game-- which is now playable (you can log in). Steam did not give any refunds for this game so please keep in mind that with potential future log in issues, you will not be able to receive a refund.Graphics: 9/10 - the graphics in Nether are pretty amazing considering it's a first person MMO. The environment is filled with skyscrapers, subways, deserted cars and debris. When you walk through the devastated city, you really get a good sense of lonliness and the need for survival. The nether are violent creatures that can warp all around you and the animations are done very well. The first-person perspective looks really great when running; changing weapons and using the various different melee weapons on nether. There's really not much better in terms of graphics on an MMO, in my opinion.Gameplay: 7.5/10 - Moving around the city is pretty fluid. If you've played shooters like call of duty, the controls will certainly feel natural to you. If you're hoping to use an Xbox game controller, as of right now it seems phospor has only half implemented the controls for it. You can shoot, run, and move around using your controller; but access to the map, inventory, and quick-slot items are not available. The movement seems well thoughtout, in that it is pretty simple but effective. You can jump  over obstacles, climb ladders, sprint to outrun nether or bandits, and crouch/prone for the stealthly approach. There is an option when leveling up to increase your jumping height so that you can access higher areas, which I thought was very cool. The melee system is pretty good. You can block and power attack when leveling up the melee skill. Often times you'll find yourself wanting to melee nether, so that you don't have to make much noise -- avoiding other confrontations. The nether themselves can be downright scary! If you're wearing a pair of headphones and walking through one of the cities subways in the dark, you'll know what I mean. I found myself more than once turning around to see a huge Golem Nether charging right for me. The nether aren't perfect, though. They tend to get caught on things when dealing with elevation, like scaffolding. You won't mind too much though, since you can beat the heck out of it without it warping behind you then. There isn't a huge amount of Nether roaming around; maybe a few per block. The real danger, as with any survival MMO is the other survivors. There are multiple Safe Zones, in which you can trade(courier missions from 1 SZ to another), sell, and store some items in a global inventory. When you die, if you can make it back to a safe zone, any items that you put in your global inventory you can have access to. The problem with these safe zones is that they are very easily campable. Make it to a high-level and just pull a nice sniper rifle out of your bank? Step three feet outside a safezone and get stabbed by a level 1 hiding in a bush. But this sort of thing is to be expected in these type of games. Really the only gripe I have with gameplay so far is that the current playable zone is quite small, there isn't a lot of variety in loot, and the game gets pretty old - fast. These are all good complaints, considering this is in fact early access. The adrenaline you can get by finishing courier missions, while fighting off bandits and nether is pretty awesome.All in all, I still can't recommend this game, yet. Despite the high gameplay & graphics review, this is too early in development for MOST players to really enjoy. I've spent a lot of hours playing alpha & beta games, including DayZ, and this one is certainly well polished, but not as well developed. I think most players would play this for a week and move on, and I'm feeling mostly the same way. With the account sync problem taking a while to get sorted out, it worries me for the future - sync or swim. The good news is that phospor games seems really into asking the community what they want for future updates (motorbikes!?) - so stay tuned.			"

												I had bought this game some odd 2 years ago when it went on sale during Christmas time, and at the time it was genuinely enjoyable to run around with a couple friends and partake in both PvE and PvP. Unfortunately the game which had alot of promise lost it's original team working on it and everyone who owned the game had received no word as to what had happened until they hired the current team and this team has done less♥♥♥♥♥♥than the previous. No real updates to the game, unprofessional customer support, and my experience with it wasn't even that bad, I didn't have to go through a buggy launcher that worked little to none of the times, I didn't have to wait 7 ♥♥♥♥ing days upon purchasing the game to actually be able to play, and even through all the monumental amounts of♥♥♥♥♥♥the devs had given us with this game and then abandoning it like a dying puppy, I wanted to have hope that maybe they would give us something worthwhile to keep playing this game. Instead, they feel VR support was a more important feature than fixing the actual problems. This game had such great potential to be something extraordinary, just by being able to get in and looking at the small segment of the map we had available have hope for the vast open world and amazing content that could have been included in this game. I wish there was some glimmer of hope for this game, but the devs have seemed to stop caring about the players3/10 was a great idea but they never took the time to really polish it			"

Early Access Review
								If you're looking for the perfect first person, survival-game then this game ain't for you. The gameplay is a little bit choppy at the moment and the battles doesn't feel in sync. However i can see the potential in this game, but at the moment it doesn't feel optimized or polished at all. But it's early access so i have to keep that in mind, but would i recommend this game as it is now in it's current state? Nope, comeback another day and check the progress of the game instead._Pros_&_Cons_+ Developers have a good contact with their community.+ Big map and it will be bigger, with lots of details.+ Takes a different way, without zombies.- Poorly optimized- Weapons feel out of sync, takes like 1,5 sec for the trigger when you click ""shoot"". - Not many options in-game.

												[EDIT 17/01/15] - So I see that Phosphor games have officially taken back control of Nether. I really hope they can bring the game back to life and give me a reason to change this reivew to a positive one! I'll keep an eye on the updates and give the game a few plays when anything major changes!It pains me deeply to give this game a negative review but there is so much wasted potential here. I truly love this game (or rather, what this game could be) and I wish it was developed more and with much more care and attention.The gameplay is your standard survival genre, scavenge for food and weapons while hiding from monsters called 'Nether' and other players. The nether mechanics are buggy and frustrating to play against, giving everything a teleport mechanic is just a lame way of saying ""we don't know how to make different enemies so we'll just re-model the same enemy and adjust it's health and damage"". The guns are good and have a nice feel to them, ammo is a pain to get put into one stack and the weight limits are just too restrictive. You have a global inventory which acts like a bank but again, you can only store a certain weight and size limit of items meaning you feel the need to keep your best weapons safe by leaving them there instead of using them, making them rather pointless. The graphics are actually very good considering the state of the rest of the game and the lighting is great apart from metalic surfaces being a bit too reflective in my opinion.Overall, this game is 10% of what it could have been and that's a damn shame.If you have a couple of friends who'd buy this game, it's worth the small £7 price tag but otherwise - as much as it pains me to say it, I'd stay clear of this game.

												Disregard 'mixed reviews,' this game IS actually playable now. I mainly make this review to offset the unjustified negative ones that are never updated, but I really do recommend the game - and at $10 with no crappy premium packages like they used to have, there's never been a better time to get it. There isn't much useful information about it I can put in a review, though, assuming you've already watched the trailers/seen some screenshots. I will emphasize, though, that in the description, it states that microtransactions have been removed. This is completely true, as well as other major changes. Nether is no longer an MMO, but rather a Minecraft-style game open to privately owned servers, as well as with singleplayer. There are no more purchases you can make with actual currency now, rather than the game itself (though 'gold' is still curiously in the game, despite it having no use). Also, there are hackers in PvP, as with any game. There aren't very many, and the anti-cheat is satisfactory for me, but don't say I didn't warn you.EDIT: The game is now $5!			"

												Thanks Steam Summer Sale 2014, what a daily deal this game turned out to be! The game it self looks nice when you can get past the server loading screen which crashes 9 out of 10 times. Once you get in the game you better hope that you can actually play instead of just being a floating camera. I think the $2.99 that I spent on this game would have been better suited toward a Big Mac, it would have been just as bad for me and given me the same feeling of disappointment after it was finished. I guess since I'm not spending time on the toilet after this, the game has one thing going for it.No fanboy comments, this game is just bad. Deal with it.			"

												I've played just about every survival MMO out there. Nether, initially, had its own style an offered a form of gameplay that none of the others offered. Where all the other survival MMOs feel like walking simulators for long stretches of time, Nether was made with a small, arena sized map based on post-apocalyptic urban decay. You could team up with your friend immediately and see them on the map so grouping up was easy. The gameplay was extremely suspenseful because the next encounter was right around the corner. It wasn't perfect, but so much fun when it worked that the imperfections could be brushed over.So what happened?Hackers. All survival MMOs have them but this game was riddled with them. The devs didn't have the resources and/or knowledge or maybe even the desire to fight this problem. It ruined the experience.Nether. I thought they should just remove Nether completely. They were buggy AF and never really added to the enjoyment of the game. The good times were had in PvP encounters with other players. In such a small map, the encounters were frequent enough to warrant removing the Nether as they were more of an annoyance than anything.I would like for a dev team to take the idea of a survival MMO, like Nether.. Small urban decayed map, easy to team up with friends, PvP focused, and run with just that. I think it would do well on Steam. This, unfortunately, did not.			"

												I usually don't write reviews out of lazyness, but after reading a couple here I feel like I should.A lot of reviews mention hackers being a problem, which was very very true and very very annoying. Keyword was. Since VAC support was enabled a couple days ago (early November '14 for distant future readers), I have yet to see one -- which makes the game fair and playable in the first place.It's similiar to DayZ, but puts less emphasis on realism and is more action-horror-y. Falling 15 feet won't cripple you until you find meds, you just lose some HP which can be healed with any sort of medical item.Food/Hunger is a thing, but easily maintained.There's a bunch of different Nether, some of which you can comfortably melee once you get your way around the combat system, others I wouldn't take on with a sniper rifle and 500 meters between us.Like in other games, Death comes cheap. You can try to be friendly, sure, but odds are you'll get shot and your corpse looted. Goodbye to your stuff and your XP.Yes, XP. Playing earns you XP - Character XP and Account XP. Character XP are reset every time you die, but fairly easy to get. If you know what to do you can reach level 30 in an hour or so. Every level up gives you a stat point which you can invest in any of your six skill trees, all of which give a perk at level 1, 4 and 10. You don't have to finish or abandon one as you go, you can mix it up as you want.Account XP are permanent and give you minor but helpful bonuses, a rather early one is +20 HP for example (for reference, you start with 1000).All in all I'd definitely recommend at least trying it out, and if 10 bucks is too much for you wait until it's on sale (probably will be during Winter Sales) and grab it for threefiddy			"

												I bought this game back before it went on Steam. The day it was first sold, that's when I got it.Do I regret it? A little, yeah, because I paid $30 back then and now I could've gotten it for so much less.But let's look at the game itself;1. Filled with hackers and has been for months. I didn't even bother to waste time on the PvP servers due to this for so long.2. PvE servers have just been added and it has drawn me back into the game. Yes, now you don't have to worry about hackers killing you.3. Really good looking game. Great graphics and nice atmosphere!4. A very good amount of loot to find. I honestly find too much, but that's because my account has been loaded to the brim with loot for months.For example, there was a Reaper near LSZ and I decided to check it out.. When I got there, 15 people were killing Nether as they charged us, with a Reaper coming down the street. One of the best experiences in this game right there.I *hope* PureFPS gets the hacker situation fixed, but as of now, only buy this game if you're looking to do PvE.			"

Game takes about 3-4 minutes to load the server browser, and once you have done that, guess what? A game where you are a spectator, watching nothing but the empty streets. That's my new Nether Experience! But wait, there's more :DGuns now need to be found in cases, which funnily enough, can only be opened with Nether Gold. Coincidence? I think not. It seems that the Dev's are just trying to make endless money off this game. Yay. Say goodbye to your sanity if you want to play this game.Don't get this game, seriously, waste of money, time, and unless it changes, this review won't.			"

												Do not support this studio. Please.I bought this game at full price and was greatly dissappointed. Terrible optimization, clunky gameplay, laggy servers.The fighting mechanics against monsters doesn't feel balanced...doesn't make sense. Other players on the servers lag around, especially in groups...making PvP almost impossible. You will find yourself just dying...not knowing what happened (Did I get shot? Was someone hacking?). Terrible.There is also not much to do. You will be bored very quickly.			"

												a nice game where you can be spawn camped by greivers all day long.  No need to look any further for a game that is not only pointless but encourages players to wait for others to leave safe havens to get an easy kill for not other reason than ""heh, gotcha.""  Today I spawned in the world only to find myself on a bridge in wide open area.  I took 10 steps and was promptly executed for my trouble.  This is troubling as I spawned in the world with only 9 people on the server.  Which means the game couldn't or didn't want to put me in the world where I could actually move without being shot down immediately.  So much for gearing up and stealth play if the game lands you right in front of greiver.   The game really is pretty including the hordes of demons.  I can deal with them. I cannot deal with asshats that play a game just to screw with the guy that just respawned.    The game is expansive with no visible stoppage of play with movement and the massive and complex buildings and territory is amazing.  Honestly, you'd have a better time playing DayZ.  This game is a nice concept except for previously mentioned problems with ""Safe Zones"" being safe in the time you're there.  Just wait until you leave.  If someone doesn't follow you and kill you, you'll have a griever sniping you as soon as you leave.  Again save your money and time.			"

												First of all, its not a bad game, its atually pretty good, it has (had) much potentialNether is an unique horror-survival game where you fight to survive against other player and the nethers, nethers are like demonic-mutant-ugly-things that wants your flesh, there is  a good amount of different nethers scattered around the map, the map is a destroyed city with apocalyptic style.Crawl, scavenge, survive. (or fight idk you choose) That might be your first goal in your gameplay, now the big problem: is not that easyYou can crawl and crouch, which make you incredibly hard to spot (even for players), running is your last resort, the nethers are here to hunt you, and players are here to do the same. Oh and if you get spotted by a nether you are good as dead, because they are very unlikely to stop chasing you, also, they teleport. So, your only way of survival is fightingThe scavenge system is garbage, even if you manage to find a giant glowing container, its gonna give you food or the same crowbar you received in the tutorial, but still you could find powerful weapons or even guns!The crafting system is... meh, inside the safezones (where pvp and pve are disabled) you can find different stores (markets and the crafting stores) where you need to bring weapons parts to build guns, thats another pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because finding the specific parts you need is practically impossible.There is also a levelling system, killing people/nethers gives you xp, you level up and receive skill points, there are 5 skill categories, melee, strenght, guns, sneaky-kills-thing, and survival. Thats the good part.The bad part: die and you lose all your xp and skills, at least there is the account level, xp also apply to it and its permanent, it gives you different random bonuses each time you level up the acc level.Now: lets talk about the pvpThere is no pvpWhy? because no one is playing anymoreHow? it looks like an awesome game! It IS good but the devs abandoned the game and the new ones abandoned it again, at least they brought it back and added a singleplayer game option.Yes, the game was shutted down in 2015 because the old devs didnt cared about it anymoreAnd the new devs reclaimed it and ""resurrected it"" good job!You can still play in singleplayer and some multiplayer, but only if you have russian connection to those unstable so called ""game servers"" (jk im from south america and every server is laggy)			"

												I want to like this game.  I really do.  I give the producers points for some creativity on the post-apocalyptic front.However, the game elements that I want to enjoy are broken or unfinished (or half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if you're looking for a put-down).Putting aside the annoying fact that you lose everything and your skills upon (a guaranteed) death, exploration is buggy with random invisible walls (with loot behind them btw), hit-boxes on players are either tiny or really picky about direction, key bindings can be bugged, keeping players from using flashlights or even reloading their guns.  Overall, the game is way too frustrating because you have to fight the game itself.  I regret spending my money on this.			"

												I bought this game because i thought if I got on the ground floor of it I would be rewarded and be able to look at it on oits compleation date with a sense of pride.Ha, once again i have bamboozled myself-Day 1- Damn there's a lot of guns in all the screen shots. I should be able to find one.-Day2-This world is a cruel one, but through the power of stealth I can conquer it. Still no sight of guns.-Day5- Started a caravan of delivering boxes between two outposts to mkae money. Slightly grindy, yet interesting, bought myself a katana. There's no way for me to buy a gun.-Day20-Money to spare. Ho look at that creature of there. Larger than the standered leaper or howler, stronger too probobly, im going to try to sneak.-Day20.1-oh he's chasing me, well im sure that because he's bigger he's slower right?NoDives into the groundPops up in front of meI slash him up with my trusty katana, the best melee wepon buyable, does nothing.He looks at me,I look at him,He raises his arm,I Pray he's not OP                                                   GameLord ""Let there be death upon this one""He tripple strikes me for 1200 health instantly killing me and scattering my posessions to the windLol never found a gun, never lost a gun, take that game overlord.

								This game is terrible. It's a relatively small 64 player map game, that has just ONE map. It has a few destination missions that pop up randomly, but chances are you're already dead close to where you spawned because everyone thinks it's just a deathmatch....which it just about is. You lose your whole character when you die....I suppose to be more ""realistic"", because we all know how much fun it is to die irl over and over and over again losing yourself forever, so of course it should be used as entertainment in a game. After the 5th time or so you make a new character in 30 minutes after dying constantly to players, you'll realise that the spooky creatured, huge mapped MMO you thought this game was, is nothing more than a cheap, oversized 4 player deathmatch in a cheap city, with a few cheap missions that wont matter because your character will NOT exist 5 minutes from now unless you play when no one is online. But THEN, you will still die and all of that was for nothing. Play DayZ. or Rust. Rust is far bigger and it's barely even started. Holy balls this game is bad.			"

												Don't buy this game. It literally is a walking simulator with pay to win cash shops and dull♥♥♥♥♥combat. It might look decent in screenshots and demos due to the massive amounts of filters they have injected into the engine which also runs a rendering resolution of 800x600 from the looks of flickering edges even with AA turned on. Not to mention the game has massive stuttering issues and this is coming from someone who played this over 8 months ago and again today and nothing has been resolved.The game crashes randomly, requires an external account and their website has no password recovery that works. The game is insanely unoriginal with enemies that can't actually get to you due to the overly cluttered maps so they simply warp around like crazy.This game is just like it's in-game world: just filled with garbage bags and empty promises.

								I'm a huge surival game fan, but this game is horrible. I know it's in Beta, but still.. Completely one sided, you spawn with a kitchen knife, only to be blasted by high level players with machine guns. Even if you manage to get away and find some lewt (which is also very rare), you are then glitch killed through walls by very hard hitting mobs. When you die, you lose your character, levels, money, and inventory, only to start again with a kitchen knife and be shot by high level campers. This game is exactly the reason I wish Steam offered refunds -_-Also, installing + syncing my Steam account was a huge waste of a confusing hour before I could even start to download the game. -10			"

My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

												I really wish I can say this game is good, and to be honest, it was. It's one of those games where, it could be so much more if not for the rushing the devs had made. I actually paid for the chosen bundle as a preorder, because of the atmosphere, and the new approach of an enemy, rather than a simple zombie game. You get these, mutated human beings which can actually teleport right around you, which is actually pretty stressful if you have no idea how the A.I. Works. The envrioemnt is my style of a wasteland, you got chicago ""My hometown, in which  I still live in"" with a whole bunch of overgrowth, nature has claimed the city. And it's also got realy tall bulding, up to 6 or more floors high, which is actually pretty cool, considering it is an alpha game. The weapons are pretty limited, a pistol, a deagle, a sniper rifle, a auto rifle, a smg, a ar, you get the idea. All of this stuff was in the first release, and i must say, at the time, it was amazing despite a few glitches here and there. However, when the game sneaked out of early access ""Litterally just out of no where, POOF, game is done."" It really feel behind on what it was meant to deliver. But this isn't even the worse part. A friend of mine, namned -T- on my friends list was actually BANNED, for not only killing a hacker, but when he picked up his loot, which was normal except the money, ""He gained like, over 9 billion ingame $"" he was then banned for the following reason ""It's impossible to kill a hacker, without you yourself using artificial means, aka something like hacks."" Which honestly blew my mind! I dont know what happend to you devs, but thats just messed up, you coulda just gave everyone a wipe, or even himself not only a inventory wipe, but a cash wipe. What would be so hard to do that for one individual? In the end, something had happend, perhaps bankruptcy, and the game was ultimately rushed. Is the game worth 10$? Honestly, its up to you. But I presonally feel that the game just isnt worth it right now.			"

												This game had lots of potential but during the past 9 months or however long its been out nothing has really changed much.  As of 10/5/14 theres been SPEED HACKERS in every server.  Almost all players will shoot you on site no matter if your harmless with a butter knife and just spawned.  There is no real reason to play other then to download the speed hack and camp players coming out of the safe zones.  And this game runs like total crap, horrible frame rates.  Have to turn everythign down to lowest settings to play and i have dual 280'xs in crossfire with 4.1ghz, 12gbs ram.  The world is huge but empty at the same time with the same repetative cheap textures.  They did add a lot more boxes around the world to find food , ammo , and bandages in.  But thats about the only change ive noticed.  Oh and the server log in seems to have been fixed.  It doesnt take 10 min to load the server list.  Other then that this game still is in a horrible form.   And when you die you lose all your xp, all your loot, everything!  Theres no real missions, no incentive to even really play other then to hack, camp, and anger the newbies.  And to top all this off they want you to spend more of your real world hard earned money to actually purchase in game gear like hats, weapons, and characters.  What a load of total Horse $%^T!!!

The game was abandoned by the community quickly. Phosphor finally grew a pair and took their game back. They added the ""Resurrected"" title and removed the P2W features, but somehow screwed up the PC optimizations that worked years ago. Nothing else has been fixed and the Devs are spewing PR garbage promises about fixing it after their other projects are done.There's also more than several posts on the forums of individuals who paid for the game but can't play it because of cd-key issues.

Progressing the waste of my day to play and make a log in on a hideous forum I will never go on again only to have the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥syncd to my steam account so they may shovel rubbish into my email like a drunk vomiting into his flat mates toilet.....Log in completed...... I finger the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the sync 50 times until it loads a hard on and finally stuffs the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is my steam account.  Freshly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and ready to test word of mouth and a youtube video of WarZ giving life a second go I slap the ♥♥♥♥♥ into action.  Select play on steam present my fabulous log in info for the ♥♥♥♥♥ and let it spit out a mass download/install.  By this time I have roughly an hour of playtime lost to pressing buttons, checking emails, sync attempt fails and a sideways♥♥♥♥♥♥of a log in screen ejaculating its GB download into my eye.  Not letting it best me, I step out and puff a cig like a young mick jagger waiting to take the stage and return with a fresh attitude.  Download completed as I return and the game shuts down without one stroke of my keys.I fancy another go at log in and its successful only one issue........ every server is empty.  This to me appears either I am the only idiot in the world who did not read between the lines and purchased a suck fest off hype or there is no one who has successfully reached this stage of the game.  Mind you release was a day before.  I check the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥forum no info, customer support bonus instantly.I shotgun wedding and log into a server to be greeted by black screen.  Shutdown, restart, rinse repeat for another 30 minutes until I have decided this was not the best 2 hours of gaming I have ever played.  I give it a days time and look to the heavens that Halloween will bring me candy upon log in.  I load in (Day-2) suprise mother ♥♥♥♥er you get to download more♥♥♥♥♥♥for your fetish.... Frustrated I go back to the drawing board via cig presuming my mick jagger tude will return to stage.  Return after another sploog of Gigs is now dripping from my screen and select play.  Make it into a server (18 minute wait) and come to character selection.  I get a red shirt, a brown shirt, a blue shirt and some pants.  Cool♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I pick the most flamboyant gear and load in with hopes someone will spot me quick and we may raise fisticuffs.I type over side chat “is this pay to win” first response from this beloved games community is I do not think so....Not convinced I leg it around the map looking at I am legend meets a glowstick anal fest and find a player jacking off under a bridge.  I run up and slip him my blade watching him struggle till his heart ceases.  Not bad I thought.... shots then begin to pour over my character as some kid with what I assumed was a sweet purchased gun spills every round into the dirt and walls, no survival based weapons are exhausted in such a manner.  He runs away telling me I cannot attack him in the safe zone???????????  :V !!!!  He steps out again after buying more ammo to miss me and I break for it.  He vomits rounds left and right coming about as close to me as an overweight woman to a treadmill.  Based on his lack of abilites I stopped running and took a pimp stride Neoing through his rounds until he met the Matrix face to face.  I stab him in the thoracic cavity and my game freezes. I am Nether playing this again..Log out and go beat meat to lumber jack videos. "

												Nether somewhat recently took on a new developer, who took control of the game and removed microtransations, but even though the game is getting better it still needs a lot of work. Nether is essentially ""another survival game"" in the vein of DayZ, but with more varied enemies and more focus on trading and missions. But while everything looks better at a glance, the monsters are only loosely functional, and instead of doing any real animating or pathfinding for them they just make it so that most of the monsters teleport right in front of you every time they need to move, making all of the combat one big pain. It's also still fairly buggy, even retaining some bugs that seem to have existed for months despite being obvious things like flashlights being disabled entirely when the player rebinds their keys. But above all, the damning aspect of the game is that there just isn't anybody playing. The only server that I've seen regularly have more than 20 people is a PVE server, which removes the tension of meeting another player in the field and not knowing if they're friendly that makes the genre so appealing to a lot of people. The only way I could really recommend Nether is if you have a bunch of friends who can't afford much better games like Ark: Survival Evolved and have to make do with buying this for $1 on sale, because that's really all it's worth right now. This is pretty much an Early Access game disguised as a full title.			"

												LET ME SUMMARIZE MY EXPERIENCE IN ALL:When I first got the game, it was the first week of release. Besides the lighting bugs and other various bugs, the raw gameplay was phenominal... then♥♥♥♥♥♥hit the fan. I couldn't log in for about 3 weeks due to an update. once that was resolved, i met my best friend John. We played a LOT! Tons of fun just picking up guns and doing pvp. That was it. IT WAS THE BEST GAME EVER! Made 2 groups of 8 and we had a blast. It finally came to an end and we took a break for about 8 months. This break led to some interesting changes to the game. The game had tribes, crafting, and NO GUN SPAWNS! This was horrible on top of the hacking that the new VAC didn't stop. I reunited with 5 of the 8 including John to play again for old times sake. We all died literally instantaneously by hackers and we were hunted with esp and aimbot. It was aweful. Ill never forget the last words of John saying ""Wow.... They ♥♥♥♥ed this game up.""IN CONCLUSION, Nether WAS a good game, but the newer updates and new content trying to mask the bugs dosent make their situatuion any better. I hope the devs or someone of importance sees this and I hope I can sway you into the correct path so you dont make a 40 dollar mistake. It WAS fun guys.... not anymore....			"

								I got this game looking forward to the survival aspect of it, but it really is just a spawn kill fest of people camping the safe zones and killing people who have nothing. it got to the point were i would deposit everything including my knife and run around for a second, grab a coupple things then deposit ... then i realized that, that is not fun lol and a lame way to play a game. i sincerly see this game as broken. and with all the glitches, lags, and spawn killing i highly advize no one buy this game. I just wished someone told me sooner haha - its unfortunate, i think this game could have been amazing! but as it stands its LITTERALLY the worst game iv played in my 27 years of life on this earth hahaha! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME lol XP			"

												Game doesn't work, can't even load past the server screen and it freezes. I'd rather kill myself than try to run this game, it's giving me cancer of the brain. If you like games that are screen smashingly frustrating to work then this is the game for you. The latest piece of ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥running Unreal engine that doesn't work will make you froth at the mouth from hours of anger trying to even get this stupid ♥♥♥♥ing piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥to work. Good luck even trying to get out of spawn while trying to play this. It's not worth the $3 I paid for it during this sale, and would rather throw myself off a cliff than pay the $3 to purchase it again if I had the choice. Literally makes me want to chop my wang off and then let a pack of ravenous hyena's gnaw at my ballsack for 12 hours.			"

												Friend bought me this to play with me... however its very much a ""I want your butcher knife bro *BANG BANG*"" kind of game. So everyone seems to kill you on sight when you spawn and for some reason no lootables were spawning near me.  so my first impressions on this game are pretty bad. altho I am very intrested to give it more of a try but with me never getting anything to defend myself from the onslaught of butcher knife collecting enthusiasts. I dont see myself getting into this anytime soon.			"

								How's spending a hour or more searching for fairly rare PIECES of weapons sound?  How about doing that while possibly being attacked by enemies you can't kill without a gun?  Would you still enjoy it with the possibility of getting attacked at any time by any random person who could be anywhere in the world with the weapons and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-ish nature to do so?  Then this is the game for you 10/10.			"

Early Access Review
								Before I start, please excuse my english. I am not a native speaker.I am going to start with the fact that I do know that the game is in early access. This is why the game is choppy with bad optimimization (A 7970 should be able to handle this game 60 fps on highest settings fine right? That is not the case), with really bad server lag. You can also pretty much fly over uneven terrain.These are problems I am sure will be fixed in the full game, but here comes the part that is unfixable. The community is pretty much the worst i have experienced. I am talking MLG 1337 pr0 h4X0rz call of duty levels here. Its mostly a bunch of 12 year olds who could not afford dayz, or it was too complicated maybe? Dont expect this game to have complicated mechanics. Anyway the game is absolutely unenjoyable when you get killed on sight, especially when you lose all your loot and levels on death. The only real way i see of getting rid of this problem is either making a way larger map and not have safe zones , but player houses or some♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. Or straight up Pve servers. And as a final minor gripe I would like to get different bars for hunger and thirst since that would make the game way more challenging.			"

												Awful. The game itself is okay with some surreal bugs, however there are some albeit few good aspects to this. Hackers are rampant, the game has third party ""sign in"" bullcrap that can hang up and screw you over, you can fall through the ground at any time, and walking in a puddle can drown you.Next. The guns are fun and versatile, the monsters are predictable in attack patterns but their ability to teleport is what shakes things up. Players are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and hackers 9/10ths of the time, so shoot on sight if they're not in your clan. I once killed a hacker who had 10 people's worth of equipment pour out of him on death. Took me and a friend 5 trips to bring it all back and sell with the largest backpacks. Oh, so the best part? The Developers are no longer supporting this game. It's been removed from alpha/beta in quick succession so no refunds could be given through steam with their pre-release clause, and since then the updates have absolutely stopped. Asking about it in the forums on their website gets you banned, and you should not give them any more money for this game. It's not worth the $10, to be honest. So please, I implore you, do not buy this mistake. It had promise, and the developers put JUUUUST enough in to make it seem like a good thing. Once they locked everyone in and secured the money, they vanished.			"

												back in the days a few years ago, it was really fun to go out and survive, traveling to different safezones and liberate them of the nether enemies that roam there when the devices are needing repairs. As well as that it helped to get the special edition back in the day. Us players who have gotten the game in special ""Chosen Edition"" (There are other editions), We got a 2nd currency that would give us perks such as the Soldier skin or other skins. Instead when they rolled it back, They completely got rid of that. usually when game devs gets the game out of beta the people who paid the extra cash for the special editions, they get extra bonuses if they stuck around. Nope not us, we wasted 30+ dollars getting an edition we essentially didnt keep. And the game isnt that good anymore. Despite that what was the point getting the game back when it was $10 base price without special edition?  "

												This game is a cluster of generic ideas thrown together and executed poorly. There is 0 cooperation between other players. Instead, people shoot everyone they see on sight.

I've died multiple times to enemies that simply bounce around the map with horrible animations. This game isn't worth your money.			"

												Now, before indulging any further into ridiculous so-called ""reviews"" of this game from hardcore zombie game p*ssies that doesn't go into detail (no offense). I'll give you my version, including... let's just say EVERYTHING ELSE than gameplay too.At start, the games registration was a pain in the butt, I waited 2 days for the registration to go through for my account. But after that, I got into the world, spawned inside the safezone. There was no tutorial, no friends, nothing to lose. So I did what I usually do in survival horror games: Into the wild!After 10 minutes I find myself on the ground with a rifle-bullet through my head, which is where most people give up. But f*ck most people! I thought to myself and thought that would be a bad orgie, ANYWAYS! I respawned, went out again, found guns, ammo, food, drink and I killed Humans, Nethers and Demons. and yes, I made sure the humans were hostile first. for example by asking in chat and not getting a response after stalking them for 5 minutes. Or they shot first.I went back to safezone and throw some extra guns and ammo into my stash (aka global inventory) and I had a good career start as a survivalist. I also played with some friends later on, which was amazing too. Group survival, killing Nethers, hunting humans. All the more fun with a group of friends, as long as you remember one of the golden survival rules: Don't trust anyone you don't have on skype or teamspeak. -Or other voice communication device.----------Now for judging:Graphics: 7/10 -a bit over-glossy water, some weird grass-patches on pavement. But everything is clear and nothing is over the top or under the bottom.Level design: 10/10 -Very nice world, lots of buildings are open, lots of multi-level buildings, good for sniping, hiding, ambushes, hunting and scavenging.Atmosphere: 8/10 -Very eerie and semi-scary. Works well with both humans and nethers being enemies or friends. Trusting the right or wrong people? Is there a nether around the corner? you may never know.Gameplay: 9/10 -Yes, I like the gameplay. Even if I died at the start, I still came back and I got to experience all the awesome things of leveling up, getting skills and abilities, gathering loot for the sweet tooth and racking up kills. This is one of the only PVP and PVE games that I actually enjoy, due to it NOT being zombies, there's fewer hackers than most other survival horror games (atleast to my observation, I don't have statistics on it.)-The shooting works perfect, aiming and reloading, never experienced a single flaw, maybe except for the little variety, but the balance is very good.-The melee system works very nice, if you use your first skill in the melee skill tree that let's you block, you won't regret it. It will block weak nethers attacks so you recieve much less damage and no, it does NOT block bullets. You control a human, not a ninja. (to the observation ninjas are above humans.)-The health, food and drink elements are well-implemented, though simple, they work as they're supposed to.Overall: 8/10 -Yes, I really like Nether for what it is and how well it's done. It's a Survival Horror game. (no sh*t.) but it's so well done compared to other survival horror games out there. Yes, you WILL get killed, but seriously, try and name a PVP Survival Horror game that hasn't killed you... yeah? thought so. Oh? Really? Then don't use hacks, silly b*tch~<3----------Also... I played since early access, everything else than the cheapest price just adds cosmetics and easier access to some melee weapons which you can get in the wild in... under 10 minutes if you're lucky, so no need to waste money, it isn't pay to win.Back then, in Early access there was ONLY ONE SAFEZONE, BUT! They have added more since then, the playable area has doubled since early access and the loot is in containers now rather than lying on the ground, which I like a lot.Oh, and it's easy to gather teammates, just write in chat on the server and get some skype names or get together for some voicechatting. THEN you can trust them a bit more than down the barrel of your 12 gauge...			"

												Nether's gameplay is pretty cool. But that's not what this review is about. The launcher is laughable, if not, totally a mess. I have an account with playnether.com and when I try to go to the site, it gives an error that says that it's https certification has run out about 56 days ago (90 for forums). If that doesn't say much, then I don't know. Actually, I can't even connect my steam account with my playnether account because it keeps asking for authorization, which I've pressed maybe 8-10 times or more. The launcher is completely broken and the account management is laughable. You can't even link your steam account to your playnether on the website! HA. This game is amateur at best, and lacks what it tries to accomplish. I like how the game is in 1st person, but I can easily do that on DayZ. This game falls short in comparison to DayZ and unless the launcher/steam link is fixed, I have no use for these 5x72 hour guest passes that I won't recieve for the 50 Nether Gold. Go figure.			"

								This game needs a lot of work with the gameplay specially. I've played it and it is basically a post apocalyptic death match. Like call of duty with monsters along the way. Just stupid. enough with pvp. I am tired of it. we need to work together instead of killing each other all the time. There has to be something in the game that would motivate you to work together and there isn't. Just garbage in my opinion and I am allowed to have one. I truly don't see a difference between this and WarZ. ON top of all things, when I bought it I was promised beta keys for my friends and they lied to us by telling us something about server load or some crap. In the mean time more people were buying the game. Bunch of liars. I wish I can get my money back.			"

												I LOVE this game, but do I recomend it? No.""Why? You said, love this game!"" you might ask yourself, or... you know.. you don't (I can't read your mind, duh)It is because of a simple yet terrifying issue, the developers and their ignorance.You see, this game had arguably the best base for what it was, an online-multiplayer post-apocalyptic survival game, but it was different (and still is)!Nether plays in world inhabitited with terrifying monster able to fly or simply end your life with ease, if you don't look out! There were no zombies crawling around, these guys were genuinly trying to kill you and after a while you could distinguish between screeches and decide wehter or not you're butt is going to be kicked if you don't run or if you're able to fight this thing.You had a vast varity of weapons ranging from the kitchen Knife with wichi you start of with, up to sinper rifles and machine huns to quickly end your enemy's life with. You needed to sneak around and try to avoid enemies early on and try to find loot in many locations. You couldn't just run around and kill everything in your way to get farm what you want and this was further made interesting by the huge world and the intiguing looking atmosphere. It ain't no dead land with a bunch of dead trees. The wolrd was still alive with plants growing all around the town as if it wasn't touched for years whiole still maintaining the atmosphere of death and fear.I would go as far as this game having the base of an ""Last of Us"" online multiplayer!You could craft ammo and equpment, trade things in for material or cash to buy things. You could store Items in case you die and you had a skill tree which made sense and wasn't jsut a thing to fill in for fun. You had to decide which things were important for you since there was a level cap. So this all sounds well and dandy but what exactly is the whole bad thing? Where is the worm in the apple?Well, let's say it like this: If you don't take care of your pet, it'll rot, and this s what happend with it.The game jsut wasn't given any love from the devs anymore and was at some point in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There weren't any updates, unstable servers (atleast for me at that time), hackers came and left as if it was their playground to play go in and a major part of the community acted like they were playing DayZ or Rust by camping other players, at the safezones to kill them over and over again for goods and cahs until they stopped playing, which was originally why I stopped aswell.But then we saw a spark of light in the dark: Nether Resurrected!This is it! The devs heard our cry of help and revived the game after it being dead and having the servers shutdown! Early access buyers were even rewarded with the dlc and a bunch of Keys which were part of the In-game microtransactions (What a good Idea amarite!)! And then we saw what they did to the game.Nothing.No Valve anti-cheat or what ever it is called. No taking care of the newbies and high-level problem. Nothing.The only thing they did is add a single-player mode to let you play with yourself instead of your friends. I have a computer and the internet, if I want to play with myself I'd have more than a million sites to do so! But I guess it's still better than being constantly killed by the same guy over and over. Sooooo, after finding my way into the Singleplayer, I realised slowly how they didnt add♥♥♥♥♥♥into the game. I even feel like I find either extreme ammounts of loot or wander around hoping to find atleast a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ baseball bat. You would think having a map, big enough to wander around a couple of hours in would make finding loot easier but NOPE, one entire half is basically jsut a bunch of hills of which 1 out of 4 has a building on it and about 1 in 10 of these building has something to loot.Like I said, the game has and still had an amazing base and an amzingly good approach on the survival-type genre, but it just lacks love from the developers.Even though this game has so many flaws, I still like to pop into the single-player once in a while and just chill in the wonderful atmosphere tgey created but never finished...

												Resurrected? Ok sure....... as much out of the blue as when it suddenly came out of early access. By the way, if the devs read this, I and many others, and I think I'm talking for more than half of your community are still waiting for a formal apology for:A. Going out of early access out of the blue without much if any explanation here on the store page.B. Not finishing the game at all, leaving it with so many bugs, placeholders as well as a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥free to pay you even more system that was there to just rip us off even more.C. No formal apology or even a farfetched excuse (yes I want you to apologise for not apologising). They just confusingly left the store page at ""We're out of early access! Come buy the game now!"" Just so that even more unaware victims would buy it based on the favourable early access reviews that pretty much ignored all the bugs and placeholders since it was in early access.Fun fact: this could be THE game that made people stop taking the ""potential"" of a game into account when reviewing early access games.I'm gonna wait from reeeeeally faaaaaaar away and poke it with a stinky stick form time to time. I'm extremely sceptic about this game because until now this has been the worst purchase of my ENTIRE life, like literally my ENTIRE LIFE. And I've got myself a 4 pack as well with 2 more copies none of my friends wanted. I was SO disappointed at it that whenever someone asks me about early access I tell them it could work like maybe a few games that went out of early access in a year, it could stay in indefinite early access like Rust but still be a pretty good game OR like with Neather, the devs could just go out of early access out of the blue saying it's done ♥♥♥♥♥es! We're off to burn your money, deal with it! So yeah I'm very sceptic about this... but who knows, maybe pigs will fly one day, until then I do not recommend, like at all especially for a “finished game” as it’s still labelled as such and not in early access.

								Good game idea but very poor support.I complained about this on steam forums and posted a link showing another persons frustration at trying to get the game to run and was banned for spam by a developer.I ended up getting the game to run after 3 weeks.If they dont like what you say about the game on steam forums they ban you or lock thread.

												I've played this game in alpha. It wasn't half bad compared to a few other games of the same genre. That being said I deleted it after my trial expired and recently decided to download it as it's currently so cheap. Unfortunately steam will connect to nether and apparently must in order to play. Until said bug is fixed i must not recommend purchasing it through steam.			"

								First of all I MAY change my recommendation... Don't bother buying the fancy edition with the extra gold. Might want to wait till this game is ""finished."" Give it at least a year.First, I'll write about the experience I have beginning the actual game, then I will go over some other things about this whole thing overall.So, skipping all the issues with the servers...Get in a medium player count game, find some ammo and a can of food... kill 2 nethers with a kitchen knife, Either they are easy to kill or the hit indications are may be bugged or you simply dont start with max health. level up a few times. Start looking at options... oh, no key mapping... so no key ref either... figure out chat... its a bunch of kids and people who speak like they are gay russians. No one wants to coop, or even respond really to anything... I realize my ""thirst and/or? hunger"" indicator is getting low... getting chased by more nether, not finding a damn thing. Glitchy movement, gets stuck in crouch on all kinds of edges... sometimes auto-runs? Idk, he just starts running and I have to jump and press all the movement keys to stop.... So, Im thirsty I guess... ok Ill run to the safe house on the map... it does after all have a market... I run there, map is annoying, no minimap, can't move in menu. I get there, all the while Im worried about some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sniping me so Im happy to see we are unable to attack in safe zone... wheres the damn store im thirsty?... A message comes up, safe zone under attack? Ok crap... ok... Well, nether all over the place just like that... don't know from where but they teleport so w/e... (surely the game designers didnt just spawn a hundred nether on top of me) So I repair one nether fly catcher dumb machine, then 2. Think to myself, sweet, everybody will be all over this place to help me and I can figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on in this game. I go to chat, and am totally ignored by a gay russian who, as far as I can tell, is just talking to himself about people wearing scary masks... I say hey who is coming to help out repair the crap... gay russian responds telling me not to go there cause its under attack... DUH. I just said... nevermind you nub... I ask where is the water. No answer... so I repair all 6 of the things, level up from sneaking (i think the nether glitch out, some will look at you as you sneak past them.) Yay all the dumbass creatures are gone. Lets get some water... I'm losing health now... ok... store is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... good luck figuring it out for the first time(another little annoyance.) I'm not worried im losing health I got 50 nether coin... and they are resetting nether gold and characters here in a week... shopping spree... Ok heres a bottle... Oh... wait a minute here... really? No water for sale, just an empty bottle you fill up at a ""spring"" which cost 75 bucks(not special coin)... well I got 50 nether coin... o? I can only use nether gold for a gasmask and some other dumbass♥♥♥♥♥♥ ok...So yeah... Maybe if you have like 5 close friends to play with and they update the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this games system and website... go for it...alsoloading it up is tricky, website is just goofy programmed... no real confirmation email a day later even tho it says it sends you one... I think I somehow got lucky in getting it to align with steam, needed to go back and fourth through pages and reload website a couple times... and it used a name it said I couldnt sign up with when I actually did sign up...?? mmmk... something to do with steam... i guess...

												This game came out at the same time Space Engineers and I bought them both, betting on the promisses the dev teams made. Nether was a bit more expensive than Space Engineers at the time so I had a little more hope for the game than SE.Now 2 years later, SE has improved ridiculously, keeping touch with the community and updating every week, while this game has barely improved at all and the devs just seem to be interested in renaming the game every year and not actually updating anything.This game runs embarassingly bad for its graphics. Level design is amateur at best, gameplay boring and pointless, shooting any gun seems to have a spread of a mile long and the meelee weapons are as cheaply programmed as humanly possible. And the worst thing about this game is that it has microtransactions and ridiculously long cooldowns. So in conclusion, as a suggestion to the developers of this game I think they should maybe learn the game design part of making games and maybe start with a side scroller or something.			"

												This game had so much potential when I tried it in beta.  Picked it up for cheap during the sales and was severely disappointed.  The server browser locks up the entire computer for about 5 minutes.  After connecting, the game is buggy beyond belief.  It feels like you're playing in alpha.  The interface is ugly and extremely difficult to understand.  Objectives in the game are ambiguous.  There are only a few missions you can do such as deliver packages and repair broken devices.  This game needs a complete overhaul.  Bugs need to be fixed.  The interface needs to be more intuitive.  People need to be able to buy/sell items in a logical way.  It's not the next DayZ, it's more like a MMO Killing Floor with more bugs than an anthill.			"

								1. Running on full graphics, this game looks like♥♥♥♥♥ Not to mention they added colour which takes away from the original horror look I loved about the game.2. Complete joke, overrun with mobs, no loot anywhere, you'll be lucky to find gum or some kind of food, filled with broken garbage (weapons) that you will never get a chance to craft, because you will get murdered by the time you get to the npc.3. No clip through most buildings, the jumping is broken, and if you do meet anyone they will murder you on the spot and take the lousey kitchen knife you are given.Do not buy this game, you are better off spending the extra $5 to buy RUST or even DayZ SA; this game is a complete waste of money. If someone gave it to me for free, I wouldn't play it - it's that bad.			"

								The sound really exciting to begin with, but everything ends up making me feel scamed.THe first 3 days i tried just to enter a server and play, but found that impossible.so i excited waited, looked at the forum to see what people wrote about the game.It seems that there was rumors, that the game was a ripoff from warz and the 2 companies was the same.so after 10 min of gameplay, everything is alike, the different is there is no zombies but only nethers.So for not being able to play game at all within the first 3 days and everything is so laggy and not being able to get a refund,i feel really scamed.the game is supposed to be in beta phase.. have you seen other games in beta? The new excelent game ""Rust"" by ""Garry"" have 10 times more game content , everything feels well devoloped and thats only in alpha stage and thats something you can say abiut Nether. dont waste your money, wait for Rust, it will be available on steam in December if you want a great survivel game thats still in progress and follow it on playrust.comSo the game is lacking conctent even when being in beta.Have so many isues with servers and FPS.cant recommend it in any way.1/10\\Saintz			"

								First of all: Do you like PvP? If not then don't get this game. Nether focuses too much on PvP and there is no such thing as ''friendly'' players unless you are playing with an IRL friend. Safe Zones? There are none because other players kill you the moment you leave. Dying in this game is what's going to make you stop playing the game because every time you die you lose ALL the gear you have on your character as well as all of your skill points, and you WILL die constantly. I got to level 30 ONCE which is pretty much only possible if you play on empty or low populated servers, don't even try and reach level 30 on a full server let alone level 20 because you won't. As i reached the level 20+ levels i thought to myself: ''What now?'' I had the best of all the equipment so there was literally nothing to do, had i gone out of the Safe Zone my character was in i would've been instantly sniped by players from every side all while attracting 100s of Nether Monsters. The only pro i have is the Graphics Quality the game though was decently optimized.Lastly: I played this mostly at release but from what i'm gathering the Game hasn't improved or changed other than adding a Bike and a Glider and some Sub-way stations underground. Don't buy this game because it's already dead. And it's not even out of Early Access yet.			"

I can handle the Nether most of the time and other players, it’s the distinct lack of supplies’ which gets and lets me down every time I play this game.I’m not the only one, I was having a chat with a gaming buddy on Nether and for the first time he has felt he has needed to HACK the game in order to play and get some satisfaction from it! Such a shame as I can see this game kicking off big time with a few changes.Need more Goodies lying about, ammo pills and crisps etc. or make shop a lot cheaper!Less hacking can you devs at least let us re-spawn in the same place we died!!!!???Come on DEVs make me want to play this game… As this is your job… because at the moment I’m switching off and going to play some Just cause MP.2 out of 10			"

								I'm really enjoying this game. A lot more than I thought at the begining! The Nether creatures are challenging, and the pvp element keeps me on my toes all the time. Really feels like a dirty gritty survival game. I just really hope that 3rd person view stays out of it because it kills the surprise element of running around a corner, and having to run like hell from a player or nether. Not to mention the ability with most 3rd person views to look through ceilings and floors to see if anyone is in the subways or the next floor up in a building. Honestly it would ruin the game completly for me. But as it is right now I love it! Especially the pvp element. Makes my heart race when I see a player down the road with a gun.			"

It died very fast and only the most dedicated still play, as of now. Sadly, the game was never very polished or optimized to begin with, so low framrates, horrible textures and floating objects are the norm. :( I'm glad I got this game at an extremely low price, because as of now, its not a game, but a corpse of what could have been...

												let's start this off with saying this game isnt bad. the game is aright and looks pretty good but there are always pros and cons to every gamepros. solid gameplay: the game play it self is pretty solid i mean aiming isnt so bad and just running around the map is pretty good graphics: so i play on a laptop so i have to run the game on low but even with that the game looks alright and i cant complain about itcombat: well i said the aiming wasn't so bad and it isnt and the melee combat isnt bad i mean just like most other games like this on out there you still have to do the old school circle strafind around enemies (i do hope they fix that) so over all the game was worth the 3$ that was spent on it cons.ok so this is where this game kills me like seriouslyuser interface: alright so when you start the game you have to login and i dont mins that its the part after that once you are logged in you are instantly thrown into a server menu like wtf so you finally pic a server, Then you finally get to change everything and customize your characterKEY BINDINGS: ok this is the worst part i dont have this issue because i am right handed but anyone who is left handed is totally ♥♥♥♥ed. i mean like you try to re-bind certain things and it doesnt work like what the hell and there are some keys that you cant even re-bind. like they dont have an option to change them at all (like what the hell who does that) i seriously hope that this gets changed like NOW because that is just dumbingame menu: ok so i will give it this they in game menus are simple and very clean but my biggest issue is that you get quests but you dont have a specific quest menu and the reason this is such an issue is because it isnt obvious what ou are supposed to do like it tells you once and kinda gives you a map marker but other than that nothing. this wouldn't be so much of an issue if they made it a little more obvious what the hell you are supposed to be doingWell because of all of this the cons heavily outwheigh the pros. to this game which is sad because this game has such potential to be great and to be honest i like this idea more than most servival horror games. so in conclusion i sadly have to give this game a thumbs down "

												A game with so much potential, and so many interesting and nice people on it. In the past 4 weeks I have experienced highs and lows. I purchased this game in ealry release and enjoyed the beta, at first I couldn't get to grips with what was to me anb alien genre. The survival game is something I had never tried before and I picked this one because it seemed to draw my attention. After about 30-40 hours I gave up and left it on my harddrive collecting dust for all I know.I recieved an email saying the game is now in full release and gave it another go. I quickly found myself immersed in the gameplay and ran packages, scavenged and generally did all the things freshies do in a game ( which included getting shot every now and then XD ). I then came across a group of people with whom I developed a great rappor with and it intensified the experience 100 fold. These people I hope will continue to be my friends even though I no longer play this game.""Why stop playing a game you enjoy so much?"" I hear you ask... Well the answer is simple: Hackers. Cheaters. Glitchers. Aimbotters. ESP-ers. These people who use illeagal modifications to give them the upper hand in game have become a plague worse than the Nether created for you to fight against in the first place. Before the recent patch where the in game money system was changed (please check the patch notes for the relevant information) a normal player had the joy of killing a hacker and being greatly rewarded. The money and weapons they would drop would ensure your competitiveness and in a warped way kept the game fair, in as much as you were able to always fight back against such injustice.The latest patches have given the game over to these hackers who are now ruining the experience of decent players everywhere. Don't believe me? go to Twitch.tv and chack out people streaming Nether and ask them about hackers and their impact on the game...If you want to play a survival game with a great idea and some really great creatures with a world big enough to challenge you for hours on end then Nether is definitely a game you should own.

												All I can say, is that the trailer really nails the premise of the game; You run around looting a big desolate city, until you either get shot by another player, or get swarmed by monsters. Either way, you will die over and over again, losing everything you've gathered, including all the levels you've gained. You can also team up with friends or players who are in the same clan, to capture territory, which serves no goal whatsoever.There's no goal, meaning or sense of accomplishment in anything you achieve in Nether. It looks pretty at first, but the boredom and frustration ultimately overshadow the few good things this game has to offer. Too bad.			"

And even if you do buy stuff with real money, its all gone when you die which is totally criminal, and i mean EVERYTHING, your character stats, inventory, gear, you lose EVERYTHING, so you could of just spent $50 of real money on in game stuff and then its ALL gone as soon as you die.

												Well I've played nether in my opinion long time ago, don't remember when exactly, 1 or 2 years ago if it's possible.Thought to myself that I would try it again and see if there were any progress with the game.Startup, you get a tutorial package...deliver it to ""Lakeside safe haven"" I go there, so far so good, killed 8 monsters on the way no biggie.Takes me around 15 minutes to run and finally in the safe haven...""Safe haven has been compromised"" please evacuate until its safe again. (1 hour)What the actual ♥♥♥♥ in my opinion, I know the drill from before but as a newstarter to the game, the tutorial says, ""deliver package to safe haven""...keep the safe haven safe then ♥♥♥♥tards...why as the first thing you have to ♥♥♥♥ up for the beginner?...I ran around bored out of my♥♥♥♥♥killing just to spare time...ends up dead because of this♥♥♥♥♥♥..♥♥♥♥ you and ♥♥♥♥ this game, no one plays it. 0 people on that europe server I played on, the server who had the maximum had 11.Tip: Take it down, fix it so their is at least one ""safe haven"".The game idea I do like but it's not finished so take it down and finish the damn game instead of giving out♥♥♥♥♥♥that will just make people angry...

VERDICT: Nether brings together an amazing graphically detailed post-apocalyptic world sprinkled with some addictive PvE elements like: skill leveling, quests, trading and weapon crafting and tops it all off with an optional PvP component that allows you to stalk and kill other players on top of the A.I. controlled nether.Its STALKER aesthics meets Fallout (3 & NV) style gameplay.  Singleplayer content maybe a little lacking for someone who enjoys both games however.  Yet this has to be one of the best ""unfinished"" games Ive have the pleasure [and frustration] of playing.  There isnt that much the game needs to take it from being very good to great.  The learning curve at the beginning is pretty tough.  So much so that I almost gave up playing the game.  Gameplay diversity is fairly limited but conversely addictive as you try to build-up your character and their equipment.  Once you've played the game for a while you may perhaps miss features that other survival games provide like base-building.  It certainly doesnt have much of a dynamic past completing missions and boosting your equipment, other than staying alive ofc.  The game has also received a recent re-boot by the original developers, so content and features have been reset to an older build.  They intend to add modding and possibly PvE but what exactly, remains to be seen.That said if you can look past the shortfalls in content diversity, the yo-yo development tract, the customary spawn-campers, kill-on-sighters and cheaters there is a veritable enjoyable post-apocalytic, survival experience to be had.  In single-player or PvP. But are you brave enough to try?... More info below ...01. GENRE: Online open-world, sand-box, survival PvP FPS, with optional singleplayer.02. SETTING: A decimated post-apocalyptic Earth where most of the population have been transformed into mutated forms called the Nether, by some otherwoldly event called 'The Cull.'  03. STORY/BACKGROUND: These monsters hunt the vestiges of humanity who try to survive in technologically protected safe-zones, as they attempt to kill as many Nether as possible and scour for loot across the once majestic cities of civilization.04. GAME MODES: Predominately PvP but most of the gameworld mechanics are PvE.  There is a single-player mode but some of the gameworld features are not balanced for this mode.05. GAME/LEVEL DESIGN: Nether boasts a wonderfully conceived and well-designed gameworld. It possesses a raft of features and artfully incorporates them into a beautifully atmospheric, greatly detailed and extremely immerisve gameworld that is not only a joy to play but addictive to.  There is one map of a large city containing safe-zones. Dynamic events such as escort missions, air-drops, and hostile Nether surges occur to mix things up.  Anti-nether devices can fail rendering safe-zones ineffectual.06. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: The game uses a common gameplay cycle: Equip yourself. Explore.  Fight. Kill. Loot. Undertake missions.  Earn money.  Buy better equipment.  Rinse and repeat.  There are diversions which spring up dynamically: Escort packages to a safe-zone, take packages from A to B, sell junk combinations or nether parts at the appropriate vendor.  For which you receive a combination of XP or credits.  XP levels your character, credits enable you to buy the equipment required for prolonged survival in the wastes.  You can also craft better firearms to kill the bigger threats: players and reapers.You can level up your character skills: Guns, Stamina, Survival, Strength, Stealth and Melee.  There is a max level so not all aspects can be maxxed out but you can customize the character to the way you wish to play.  PvP just adds another layer of gameplay by forcing you to fight to stay alive.  Where its kill or be killed. The game expects you to die and lose you characters skills.  Unless you had a buddy you will respawn with only a knife, whatever is in your global inventory (which is not much) and the game bonuses that your account level gives you.  It is this cycle that will frustrate you at the start but it what ultimately keeps you playing.  Indeed the account level is critical and makes a huge difference the higher it is.  To increase it ofc you need to keep playing.07. ENEMIES: Has only a handful of distinct enemies from low level dog-like hunters, to alert screaming sirens, brutal golems and spine firing hunters.  Biggest threats are Reaper.  The name says it all.  Dont go hunting these brutes without the firepower or manpower to bring it down.  In PvP however the main threat is from other players.  Some of which wont even give you a chance to draw your weapon.  08. A.I: There is a reliance on having mostly fix spawned enemies so the A.I is fairly limited. It does an able job however for once you are spotted you will be attacked by any local Nether.  Get a screamer near you and it will alert many more Nether than you are able to deal with.  Once alerted unless you can outrun them to hide or get to a safe-zone they will not stop coming after you.09. CONTROLS: Standard mouse and keyboard.10. GRAPHICS: Attention to graphics detail is what brings Nether to life.  Even though they may not be top notch I found skulking through the gameworld during the day or at night sheer bliss.  Unless I was too busy running away from Nether.  The ruined cityscape is hauntingly beautiful.11. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: There is no real soundtrack but a low continous haunting humming sound provides a constant companion as you trek through the post-apocalyptic environment that perfectly adds to gritty atmosphere.  Nether enemies have their own distint call, wail or roar.  Weapons have decent sounds also.12. VOICE ACTING: None.  But those of you with teamspeak can listen to some banal player communications in your head-set! :p13. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY: Has a painful learning curve at the start of the game but once you start playing and understand that equipment and weapons equals survival you can make dying that little less painful.  At least in single-player. 14. PROBLEMS: Slight lag on my Core i3 at 1280x720 with most options off. Issues are minimal with some interface design and game-world clipping issues.  15. ACHIEVEMENTS: There are no achievements for this game.  No need to distract players from the enjoyment of staying alive.16. DLC: No dlcs currently.17. MODDING/ONLINE PLAY/COMMUNITY: Havent experienced much of cheating since the early days of this game when there were many hackers and cheaters that culled alot of eager players such as myself.  There are fewer now but that doesnt mean they wont come back with a vengeance.  Safe-zone campers and Kill-on-Sighters are also present but its hard to know how many.  Admin capabilities are being added so servers can be policed.  But unless you are prepared to put up with dying and restarting alot dont try PvP.  You will hate it.  The biggest plus is modding being added to allow servers to be customized.18. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL: Single-player will appeal to anyone who enjoyed playing Stalker or Fallout out.  At least to some degree before too much repetition of gameplay sets in.  If it does those of you bave enough can try PvP.  Anyone who enjoys survival games or hunting other players in a sci-fi setting would enjoy this.19. PLAYTIME/LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY: Unless you are a pro survival game player it will take you upwards of ten or so hours to get to grips with the early game, 40h to get self-sufficient if youre me.20. VALUE FOR MONEY: Im not one for much PvP yet in single-player it has an underlying addictive quality that compels you to one more safe-zone to safe-zone run.  On balance I think it has just enough content and features to be worth £7.			"

												It's a pretty alright game. Wish the devs hadn't abandoned it. For $10, not bad. That's $10 less than most other games of this sort. $10 less because we're not paying a dev team, or customer service team, or any team at all for that matter, it seems. I say give it a go. Now, all the negative reviews are true. Load screens are horrible the first couple logons, and without some manual graphic optimizations, it runs poorly. (And yes, if you neglect to read the bit where it says ""REQUIRES A 64 BIT OPERATING SYSTEM,"" it will not get past the launcher for you. PvP is horrendous, but fortunately the devs DID make a PvE server branch. (rather than banning hackers, cause that takes consistancy.) If the game developers were to become more active, I'd gladly pay $20 (regarding roughly that as average price for your average survival game.) Now, the cash shop option is not nearly as bad as people make it seem. 9/10 items you can buy with real money, you can find in the world, or buy with in-game money. Now, character skins is where the real money comes in.... There are a lot of (rather lackluster) skins for your character, and all fairly cheap. BUT, the only way to get more than the standard 3 skins (two male, one female.(all bald...)) is to spend real money. However, given this game has no 3rd person camera, the only options you really need are provided; male, female, skin color, and the color of your clothes so you can choose to blend in to different environments more. All in all, look at it this way. Average game price as stated at $20, this game is half the price, for half a game. Take it with a grain of salt. And again, as a footnote... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOUR COMPUTER IS 32bit. That being said, if you have 64bit with low system specs, there are plenty of forums for optimizing it to run on the crappiest computers. (like mine.)			"

There is no escape from this mode.  No method to spawn in.  That's all you can do, fly around the map.Checked the forums, this bug has been in the game for MONTHS.  Avoid like the plague.

												BUYER BEWAREAt it's current state, this game is barely worth the daily deal of 80% off for around $3.00 but if it made the changes that users are talking about I would easily pay above $20.00 for this game. If the game creaters actually read this, let me provide a few suggestions to make the game better if you don't already know. By the way, I had roughly 8 friends who really wanted to play this because it seemed like a cheaper version of dayZ but they're all swarming back to csgo because of the glitches. This game has a lot of potential and I would love to see it come more to life. It provides a great way to coop with friends. -- Server loading time - I just timed how long it took to load the servers while you sit there and wait in agony thinking it froze your whole computer. From 10:43 until 10:48 I waited, and this has happened in the 4 or 5 times I have played it. Right off the bat the reputation of the game is ruined, 10 minutes of gameplay is out the window because it happens when you load and when you exit the game unless you control alt delete and crash it.-- Overwhelming glitches - It would be okay if you glitched a little bit but I already know in the future hours to play it safe jumping over a fence or anything.And great, writing this review I hear they abondoned the project and won't be updating.A friend who follows this genre well is saying that the developers did the same thing with WarZ to make a bunch of money.BUYER BEWARE			"

								Nether, upon first inspection looks to be a cool co-op game with great graphics and a great new story. Instead of zombies, you're facing inside-out beasties, which is a fresh new twist in an open world survival.However, this is where the good stuff ends.The game is overpriced, considering it is a useless hunk of crap.The load times take over 5 minutes.When you join a server, there is a 15-30 minute wait time before you can spawn, and this repeats each time you die.When you die, not only do you lose all your items and gear (expected, not a huge issue) but you also lose all the EXP and levels/skills you had aquired (ok I get losing gear, but my EXP shouldn't be affected) This essentially makes playing the game entirely pointless.Whenever you type, the camera begins screaming around as if on a rollercoaster. If you are spectating a game, waiting to spawn, it freezes your camera. I spent over 26 minutes staring at the ceiling.The community is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and trolls, yes this is indeed the internets but it's as if the scum of the internet scum league have all congregated on this one game. Within 2 minutes of me finally playing a game I was sniped by some guy in a highrise building who proceeded to send me abusive messages for an hour after. Also there is no escae/quit button. I had to restart my PC just to quit.This game steals your time, money and PC power. Do not buy it, it is shockingly terrible.

												I would like to give this a good reccomendation. I also would like a lot of things.This was, and sadly never ended up being, what I was hoping would be the game to follow in the footsteps of S.T.A.L.K.E.R and the likes.  It is a laggy, half dead piece of crap that I honestly forgot I had bought. When I had first played this game (in early 2014) I thought it was ok, I had hopes that maybe, just MAYBE it would improve. But, after it ""dying"" and being ""resurrected"" (it was neither alive nor dead to begin with) I had started to give up on it. First impressions were mediocre way back in 2014. When I saw that they had added microtrasactions I knew it would be another MMO shooter that would be strangled by the devs thirst of money. Fast forward to later this year, 2016, hurrah! Micro transactions are gone....but the devs are silent on refunds for those who bought the gold, servers are still there..sorta...yet dead ""oh, hey, a russian server with a ping of 6000 B.L.Y.A.T!!!"" Oh, one more thing, this game takes up like 16gb of space for....what? Unoptimized textures? Glithcy assets? Yeah, basically, DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A BRAIN. :D			"

But ever since that i havent been able to connect or find and South East Asia servers. On loading it freezes constantly, when i try a another server its loads doesn't connect and sends me back to the server selection.The gameplay isn't great, its good there was no hype at all. The range of added items aren't huge, the weapons are a short list (and aren't even named right i might add). Once i was in a server it was ok, didn't kick, didn't lag but fix it asap. 4/10			"

								The feeling you get after spending $30 on this game is equivalent to the excitement of paying a speeding ticket, or parking fine...you just get on with your life after, wishing you haden't been such an bonehead and thrown money away. Not to say this game doesn't have potential...it just isn't worth $30 at all right now.. and should be FREE to play in its current state. Now if you were duped like me, with all the promises, gameplay videos, screenshots, etc, etc I really feel for you. It may be a work in progress... but you really don't get to see that until you actually play the game. No amount of watching others play the game (and recommend the game) on youtube will convince you of this until you play it. I did jump the gun a little too fast after watching a couple of youtube videos, but im just so anxious for a good promising game of this genre and am starting to feel it will never come. There is a long way to go until I would consider this game any good. I just gave $30 and am not sure if I will ever see a worthy return for my investment, I am very skeptical at this point. Here is to hoping.			"

								Really feel like this game needs to have its genre tags stripped. 1 its not massively multiplayer, 64 player servers is a relatively standard FPS multiplayer count.  2 tagging this as RPG is, in my opinion, blantant misrepresentation.  The only element of RPG that exsists is a slight level of character development, which is quickly overshadowed by the lack of permanence.  You are reset back to square 1 every time you die, which is often.3 simulation, really.  Its a survival themed FPS, calling it anything else is a stretch to say the least.I really wish the description was a little more forthcoming with what type of game you would actually be playing.  The game is a slow paced, survival themed, FPS...with not a whole lot of ""Shooting"" as ammunition is ridiculously scarce.  Had i gotten a more accurate description or atleast saw some actual gameplay i would have likely passed on this game.			"

												Waste of time and money.  If you spawn in the safezones, you get killed by people camping them.  If you spawn in the world, you get killed by more people or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t enemies.  No loot to be found, terrible performance (~25fps on a 4770k, GTX 770 SLI, 16gb RAM, 250gb SSD on both High graphics/Far draw distance and Low/close draw.  No difference whatsoever), and terrible mechanics.  There is no survival, because you will die within ten mintues without hacks, and you will lose everything, so leveling up is pointless.  Menus don't work (instructions button doesn't work, many keybinds are not listed and can only be found online, lots of menu options are non-functional).  Comedic collision detection at best.  Map design is laughable, with floating cars, grass, and items everywhere.  Looks like it was just thrown together.  Save your money.			"

								I wanted to like this game, I really did. I understand that this is a Beta, but you are PURCHASING into this Beta, and therefore in its current state: I cannot recommend itGameplay feels like it is lacking too many features at the moment, and it only feels fun if you can find other people to play with.  However, at $30-$50 a pop, I would never ask my friends to purchase this game as is. Run animations with weapons look atrocious. Levels are designed lazily, with all buildings having a wide open layout, with ""skyscrapers"" consisting of tall buildings with ramps to every floor. I would prefer some buildings where, in the need, you could run and hide from a human pursuer in say a cubicle and maybe take him out with your kitchen knife as he pursues you with his Uzi. instead, as of now you have no place to hide in buildings as they are all wide open. If the developers want this to gain popularity, they have some serious work to do.			"

There's links to the whole War Z/Survivor Stories peice of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I spent around 45-60 minutes trying to get this work, following various forum guides etc. It forces you to link your steam account as well.

												While it may say I've only played 15 hours, I only recently got the steam key so before that I was playing for months before hand. This is my first review and felt because of the overwhelming bad reviews I wanted to add some good/bad points of my own.1. I've heard a few times that people can pay to win...this is just not true. You can't buy weapons or any item that will give you an advantage over another player. Now if a freaky looking mask is your idea of pay to win then yes...people will be able to purchase masks in game for real money but these items have zero stats.2. Teamwork! This is key in a survival game...I've heard time and time again where people hate this game because they get killed while starting out. To be quite honest I love when I have nothing on me. I'll go out of my way to find people and stab them in the back to take what they have. Find people to play with...plan out where you are going and what you are gonna do if ""X"" or ""Y"" happens. Will this prevent you from getting killed? Nope...YOU WILL DIE. There was a time I kille four people with a shotgun in a building and got over run by Nether and died myself. That is the way of this world and if you can't handle the loss of items then do not pick this game up.3. For awhile I stopped playing the game because of hackers...mainly aimbotters who ruined it for me but since the update I've not run into any WTF moments of people turning 180 to headshot me in 0.2 seconds flat.4. No storyline stuff is in the game yet from what I can tell.5. Nether invasion of towns are freaking HARD to clear out considering the massive spawn rate of nether but one would assume that they would swarm a town like that if given the chance. Again if you have a few guys with you and people who know how to play then you can do it.6. Did I mention you will die? Cause you're gonna die...a lot and my best advice...learn to laugh about it and understand you're...gonna....DIE! You will not have that bad♥♥♥♥♥DR-mag forever. You'll round the corner and have a TFC special smiling at you as it all fades to white.So would I reccomend this game? Depends on what type of games you like and if you have a rage issue when it comes to getting ganked. If you rage like a little 6 year old girl.....no...don't buy this game cause I don't want you getting your rage on in chat after I♥♥♥♥♥♥you with a katana while you spray and pray with your mac9. The moment you reload...you're my *****!!			"

												Nether: Resurrected feels unique and is not quite a survival game as much as it is a MMO in terms of design. You spend your time running packages from point A to point B. Along the way you'll run into Nther infested outposts and a few of the Nether creatures scattered about the world. The world is  immersive and has an impressive soundscape.Where Nether fails is in its lack of polish. It has gone through a lot of development and passed to different development teams along the way. It's not the fault of Phosper (current team) but the fault of those who have employed them.The community feels very shallow in terms of player count. However when I did make contact with other players, they were very friendly and a bit stacked (stacked = had A LOT OF GEAR). I received the top melee weapon and backpack immediately upon joining a PvE server thanks to some fellow players. I probably could've turned it down but I was not looking to invest more than a few hours into the game.I can not recommend the game in its current state due to the lack of a community and more quantity than quality when it comes to content.I am definitely impressed by the scale of the game. The city feels desolate and worn down. The empty subway tunnels echo your foot steps and it is an incredible experience. But those are the only moments I felt immersed in the world. The progression system is standard and doesn't bring anything new to the table but it definitely adds more filling to the gameplay.			"

								Honestly pretty bad. Not very fun once I actually got into the game. 9 of my 10 hours of playing this game were spent trying to log in. Once it started working, the game just felt sort of clunky. I realize it's early alpha access and all, but it just wasn't very fun. I hope they do something with this besides tweak the alpha by release, it could be great.			"

												As it stands, I regret that my advice is do not buy this game.  Nether was 'released' without actually being completed - many game breaking bugs and exploits are still present, hackers run rampant, and many basic features, such as key -remapping, are only partially implemented.  The devs have been basically silent for months, and the player base has been steadily dwindling to the point where there are now (as of 1st Nov 2014) only four active servers (EU Central, EU West, US East Last Man Standing Mode, US West).  If you're thinking about buying this game, you need to either save your money and buy something else or accept that there's a substantial risk that you'll just be left disappointed, frustrated and out of pocket.  Believe me, I don't take any pleasure in writing that, I loved this game.If the situation changes (and I sincerely hope it does) I will update this review accordingly.			"

												Game was worth $ back when it originally came out and was a work in progress, now it is crap IMO. The original Devs sold/passed the game onto some other devs and it is nothing but a $ pit now. What you had to do to survive before is now all accessible via real $ purchase. Like the new devs are going for a play for free aspect but it isn't free. I paid 15.99 an got my money's worth of play back when it was worth playing. Do not waste your money on this game, if it is free then yes it may be worth your time, but currently it isn't worth anyone's money.			"

I didn't get to keep any level or experience gained so really each time was starting over from scratch. oh and other players can kill you so thats another added thing to make you restart and lose all experience and items picked up.

												Im not 100% sure how I feel about this game.It feels like its still in ""early access"", but it's the full release? PROS :*Looks good-Use of the Unreal Engine makes this game look top notch *Good idea-The lore sounds pretty good! But it's still quite generic CONS :*Severe dropage of frames right when you start the game-Well this makes me want to stop playing already! This happens to pretty much  EVERYONE  ive talked to who has ""played"" this game!*Terribly confusing to start-Ok well it'll get better right? Nope. Tutorial sucks at tutorializing (don't care if thats not a real word)! Still more confusing then AAA devs these days.*Terrible performace-Ok so my PC isn't the best out there but it's still pretty kickass, now please tell me how im getting 30FPS with a GTX760 4gb... Like what... even on low my game still runs like crap! One of my friends runs a 290x and also gets terrible performance... I don't understand. Something in the game makes everyone bottleneck to garbage standards.*Overall still buggy-So this game coming from ""Early access"" you'd think i'd be nice and polished! And your right! No im just kidding. The walking mechanic is even buggy, like movement is about the basic fundimental thing that a game needs, (unless your playing Guitar Hero that is) combat feels  OK  but overall there is still so much that can, and should, be fixed.*Objective-Im still not very sure what the point of the game even is... To survive? Well all you need to do is sit on a rooftop or camp newcomers spawn. To thrive? Why? There is no insentive to even survive in the game! To play with friends? 1 bug plus 1 bug doesnt make the experience any better... FINAL THOUGHTS Now don't get me wrong, I don't ""hate"" the game per say but I just don't see the life that a game should have in it. You could have fun with friends if you could overlook the terrible bugs that make them not want to play this game. I wish they could just fix the game and give you something to look forward to when you level up or make it worth while to risk your life in the dead of night to get that loot drop.In the current state of the game I would not recommend it to anyone.2/10			"

												I would suppose the most popular analogue for games such as this is Day Z, and justifiably so for it is the first truely successful open world apocalyptic experience as far as I know. Nether is quite similar, and though in its early stages demonstrates an already seemingly expansive world to explore with an overgrown nature engulfed city being telegraphed with such an immersive execution. The ambiance of the desolate city scape only further ensconces the player in the shoes of the survivor as both natural and unnatural sounds coalesce in echoing harmony. Combine this with post apocalyptic often fully explorable structures, and the perpetual looming animosity of other survivors then you can have a rather tense survival experience. However, the current state of the designated enemy is rather at times frustrating. The teleporting variants of the predominant enemy known as the Nether seem to teleport consistently throughout an engagement, however they do so in such imbecilic and interspersing fashion that during the course of the conflict they will at times simply not be visible. Teleporting a floor above you, in the room next to you, outside of the building you are in are common occurrences. This problem is largely absent when fighting outside, but many battles take place around structures or inside of them (hence city). Aside from this obvious blunder there are other problems which I'm sure will be fixed or reimagined as time progresses toward a completed product. Disconnecting from a PvP engagement will also pose a problem, as in the current state it is an overly viable strategy which is only propagated by the reset of all level progress upon death (and of course the loss of all items on your person). The latter I hope remains apart of the game for it adds the edge all games of this sort require to remain suspenseful. I believe this game will resolve most of these, and other problems as I said for it is still quite a work in progress although a worthy one for any of those interested in an immersive apocalyptic experience.- I haven't touched the game since this review which was made around when it became early access. I stand by my opinion concerning the ambiance of the game, but the gameplay simply wasn't enough to hook me for more than 8 hours of play.			"

												It is disappointing when a game has so much potential and everything just goes to crap. The atmosphere and graphics are spooky, the creatures/monsters are nightmarishly creepy, the story behind it is awesome.  So what happened? I have no clue, it’s as if the developers just randomly one day said “okay we’re done” and threw the game out, and now what could have been an amazing game is now pay to win with empty unfullfilling gameplay. Sucks. I am really, really disappointed.UPDATE REVIEW 2016:So I go by everything I said originally except they took out the pay to win which is awesome.  But the devs gave us false hope, making us think the game was going to be worked on and nothing in the past year has happend.  I wish someone would take this game over and actually make some progress it had so much potential.			"

												Some people who negatively review this game after the price change may have forgotten that it is currently five dollars. Five dollars is not bad for a Friday night. Most people's dinner costs more than 5 dollars. Going out to a bar costs more than 5 dollars. You get the point. People are asking so much for their 5 dollars that games like this get terrible ratings. Yes, the developers didn;t update. Yes, the player base left. But single player works. Private servers work. The game is playable, and enjoyable. If you aren't expecting to get the ultimate gaming experience for 5 dollars, you'll probably enjoy this game. If you go into it with an open mind, you'll probably enjoy it. Remember that it's a game from 2012-2013, not 2014 like it says. This was when Radeon HD GPUs were still relevant in mainstream gaming.(Try running battlefield 1 on a 2011 radeon HD gpu, not going to be pretty) The enemies were awesome. They're fun, and unique. The art of the Nether was before it's time. The gameplay wasn't perfect, but it was terrifying and fun.If you're looking for a terrifying game where you have to make on the spot decisions about whether to hide, loot, run, or fight, this is the game for you. Play it in the dark with the volume up and no other noise. The enemies are nerve racking.Edit:Many people seem to have trouble getting past wanting to deny what could easily be called a bad developer any more money. It is true that the developer does not require more money, nor will they use said money to improve Nether. I do not usually limit my ntertainment purchases to a code of ethics based on customer service. If you are the sort that can not abide purchasing something you might thoroughly enjoy just to spite another human being, that's up to you. Please enjoy whatever game you see fit. But I still believe that Nether is a game worth 5 dollars.			"

												Let me pre-empt this with the following statement: I have not tried this, since Phosphor took back control of this game.Having said that 99.9% of my in game time was directly under Phosphor's original launch. These devs never actually listend to there customers in the first place, thats why they all jumped ship and ran away. We begged and pleaded with them to get some sort of anti-cheat into the game during the first year, instead we got mini-bikes, and new monsters. They would have polls on thier website forums asking what we wanted as new features, and never reveal the results... This Dev team had some of the worst communication I have ever seen in a game. Either they didn't care or had no idea how to fix the issues we were having, they relayed all their information through a community manager, who eventually quit. Obviously there was some apeal as I have logged over 400hrs of game play, most of those hours were hoping this game would get better, the potential was obvious, but the deves never came through for us. I for one will be very surprised if many vetrans return to this game now that Phosphor is back in control, as many thought they were a crappy company to begin with. My point to this review/rant is that things may have gotten worse after Phosphor left this project (BTW they never actually posted that they left on thier forums, only here on steam, it was months after the fact that I found out they were gone) But it was never a great Dev team to begin with. Don't assume that them being back is going to make this game great, they had an oportunity to do it right the first time, and simply walked away when it started to go bad.So don't pull out the trumpets to celebrate the return of Phosphor just yet, this was thier mess to begin with.

								The graphics are better than The WarZ. Unfortunatelly this game has a microtransaction system as well. As an owner of this game, I strongly sugges you to wait first. I'm not saying it is a bad game. I just do not want to see another The-WarZ-ish pay-to-wish crap. The micotransaction of this game draws my concern. I wish this game cold share a same system as Payday 2.			"

You can go out in the world and explore town by town which have been copied and pasted over and over, look around and you will find crates with many useless items inside and if you run around enough you may find a special occurence, getting killed on sight!

								I got this game as the desription sounds neat...concept is silly but i figured i would try it out.  First off this isnt a survival game....you will simply die.  I went throught he entire city map area and found not much of anything.  So basicaly once your food meter runs out you lose 1 health per second...basicaly that means 1000 seconds and game over.  Players do kill other players....but what is the point?  They will die anywise...as there is nothing else to find.  I found hte controlls not bad...sound and ambience of sound not too bad either...graphics where only ok...as it seams like everything was a cut and paste and the areas where empty.  game play was boring....as you literaly had nothing to do....my meter of food ran out after a few hours and that was it....game over.  I dont recommned this game to anyone because its pathetic.  Why do people pvp inthis game....becasue htere isnt anything else to do for one thing.....and becasu eits easier killing another player then killiing the nethers.  Now i am good at games like this...so i easily killed the enthers...even the hard ones...and all i used was the starter kitchen knife.  i never for once found anything besides ammunition and some healing items.  I htought there would at least be more stuff to find....boy was I wrong.  basicaly because of the fact they have nothing to find you will literaly just die.....yes this is a city area with nothing in it.  I recommend people avoid this game right now becasue there is no point to play it or test it.  You dont put a food meter in a game with pvp especialy one that runs out fast. Someone said inthe game....but its a survivor game....no thats not survivor...survivor is being able to kill the nthers for food or players for food....or killthe rats and birds for food....you cant do anything of that sort.  The rats and birds are cosmetic...as is most fo the game...basicaly the entire game is a bunch of textures with notheing else...they look neat....but nothing else.  Perhaps if they do some fixes this game willbe better...but i highly doubt it.  COnsidering they put in a fast going food meter...no real things to find...no rewards for killing nethers....i find this a waste of time.			"

												I don't recommend ""Nether"".  When you start up Nether, you'll realize that you have froze.  You literally have to wait up for 10 minutes for the game to flippin' load (depends on your computer).  Also, this happens when you leave the game, unless you task manager.  Nether has great graphics, but that's all it has.  The game is so god damn glitchy.  I can't even swim in the water.  One time, I walked through the walls of a tall a$$ building.  Basically, the game takes long to load/long to exit, and is glitchy as hell.  If this game is in Alpha, then the Nether description should say so.  Otherwise, I highly do not recommend this trash game.			"

												Played this for 21 minutes and it's one of the most laggiest, broken & unfinished game i've ever actually played...Here is what I found wrong with it in the whole 21 minutes I played it.1. Having to be forced to make a 'Nether' account to play the game.2. Having to wait around 2 minutes for the server list to actually load/respond3. Being sent to the server menu after picking a server which aren't even close to being full.4. Having to play on US servers due to not being able to get on EU servers.5. Actually finally getting IN GAME around 18 minutes into this it's really ♥♥♥♥ing laggy.Nobody should get this game unless you want a painful experience, Even Infestation: Survivor Stories is a step up from this.If you're looking for a cheap open-world zombie game, Go buy Arma 2/Combined Ops and install the DayZ mod.This is trash.

 I LIKE THIS GAME FROM MEMORY Despite all the things wrong with this game, it is still alot of fun to play, and people (IMO) are more friendly than on dayZ. This is only the case in the 'safe zones' where PvP is off, in the safe zone you can talk to people and often work together and deliver packages, they might shoot you in the back and be complete ♥♥♥♥♥ but even if they do that you have a global inventory so when you die you don't loose everything you ever owned.My  biggest  gripe is that the map is so  flat and plain  . There are no hills or any natural height differences like that, without climbing a building, but even then the buildings are dull and  all identical  ...My  next biggest  gripe is the fact that the game has  micro-transactions!   woopty ♥♥♥♥in' doo""!  Because the best thing you can add to a  P2P  game is micro-transactions... That's why I avoid most F2P games, (with TF2 as an exception) so I don't have to feel like other players have an advantage over me because thay are sad enough to put money into a f2p game.Oh yeah, and the developers don't do anything to the game, and it is buggy as ♥♥♥♥ and often will crash on launch, but in game it is stable. It just feels like a stupid money spin.But for some reason I  really, really  liked this game, maybe because I had just got sick of my xbox, built a PC, and this is the  first  PC survival game I played (if minecraft doesn't count ;P).So I would recommend it, If going purely on memory... I might even update and boot it back up again.EDIT: I recently helped my friend build his PC and when we were done he had a 20 pound steam voucher, we sat and pondered for awhile trying to decide what games to buy that are co-op / playable together. That's when I remembered nether, it is only 7 quid so he picked it up and I have to say this game is so much fun with a friend. Unlike dayZ it takes no time to find each over and you can join a group so that you can see each over on the map. We collected some parcels and escorted them through tones of nether and pulse raising PvP encounters. Glad I bought this game ;)			"

												Infestation: Survivor Stories 2.0!!!Where do I start with this game? So me and a couple friends purchase the game during the sale, upon trying to login we are hit with errors from Mber (A client thingy you have to link your Steam with), after retrying I got in, 2 of my friends not so lucky, they have been trying over an hour to get a chance to play with no success due to this highly common error it seems.After the game launches your hit with the server browser, for which you can't even move your mouse for several minutes while it loads all servers. There are no settings options or even a main menu for that matter, you have to sit and wait for the server browser to load before you can do anything.Then, when your finally in game and created your character you have a choice of spawns, safe zone or world. I haven't tried world yet although that seems like the good idea because these 'safe zones' are far from safe. You could spawn in the middle of a safe zone being raided by Nether which at that point, you can attack in safe zones and people seem more bothered about killing you and not the monsters. If your lucky, you will spawn in an actual safe zone but as soon as you walk out, you get killed off other players straight away for absolutely no reason, knowing you probaly don't have any loot worth taking or knowing you have just spawned in.Graphics are somewhat OK in places, but really unoptimised. Solid objects like fences, bin bags, drums can be walked through for some reason and when climbing up rubble and stuff it seems the invisible barrier, thats supposed to be under the texture, is actually about a foot away from it for another strange reason.Bottom line is to say this game has left the early access program is ridiculous, it clearly should still be in there and DO NOT believe the reviews that are on the game's store page rating it 4/5 and stuff because the Nether they played, to get that kind of score, is clearly not the Nether I or anyone else is playing. I'll keep coming back to it over several patches and update this review but for now, do I recommend this god awful garbage?? Do I ♥♥♥♥!!!			"

												Well i could write about 1000 words about this game but i will take it short.The game got its up and downs. I remember nether came out. It was hyped as fu** but this didnt helped much. After the early access came out the publisher decided to change the developer to PureFPS which was yeah.. the end of nether until now. Small updates, many bugs and a Pay 2 Win system was hard to stay with. But the worst thing were the thousand of unbanned hackers everywhere. God mode, cheat weapons, gold key and duping of items was the normal day of Nether. But even with that it was fun to play some times with groups. Some weeks ago PureFPS closed the servers and shutdown the game. Now Phosphor Games the first dev team got the rights to work on this game again and for now we are back at the early access state from 2014 i think. Well for now we got singleplayer back and multiplayer is on its way. I hope Phosphor games can repair what the other team broke with the players of this game. I give them a chance to fix it, i hope you guys do it aswell. Everyone needs a second chance :)			"

												Do not buy this game as it is now.Dear gamers do not be fooled like me by the positive comments of the last period. This game is still ♥♥♥♥♥♥.The lag is wild and this lead to a boring gameplay where you often have to stop because you don't know where you are going and it gets you in SERIOUS trouble during the fights with nethers. The video you see above It's a dream of how the game SHOULD work, you get an insight of how the game work FOR REAL pausing every second the video. Many times the lag was so wild I couldn't even get inside servers and got kicked out :( . People said it was ♥♥♥♥♥ier before but believe me when I say I can't even imagine how this is possible. Another complaint It's the inability to move your character left and right. I can't figure out who is so stupid to create a game in which you have to fight and leave you free to move only up and down.......while your enemies can even teleport behind you! I could add It's unrealistic too. In the end another annoying bug It's that the traders in the safe zone don't take your boxes and so you are prevented from having lots of EXP to power up your character leaving you with the only choice to fight nethers to upgrade yourself.To summarize:1) Phosphor Games you HAVE TO fix the servers' lag because It's nearly impossible to play.2) Phosphor Games let the character move left and right and not only up and down.3) Phosphor Games fix the traders' boxes bug.

												Since the addition of the PvE servers, the game is gotten a bit better. While the Devs still take week long vacations and never respond to any calls for help, never update, and still there are glitches in the game from dang near a year ago, being on a pve server and not getting oneshot from halfway across the map is a plesant experience.  Don't buy it if you expect something to take up your full attention. Blow your $10 on garrys mod. Buy it if you just want a shoot it all lootfest only to get bored three hours later.

												Okay, I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. Never have I ever seen one of the most enjoyable early access games in recent times, get ruined (well and truely) by its own creators.When I first began playing Nether it was in its very early stages, when it was an enjoyable game and little progress could be made from discovering new weapons, outposts and the occasional bandit or hero along the way. Now I look at this game and see a disaster piece. Courrier boxes to earn post apocalyptic currency, safezone that turn unsafe with no warning and above all, the greatest flop, the promise of vehicles, map expansions and weapon customisations that came in the form of weapon parts (the same weapon parts used to make the 8 or so guns available)Truely disgusted at the dev team and despite them doing the best job they possibly could with the game (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T) the result was a pointless sandbox where you choose a flag and kill for it. Utterly pointless, dont waste your money - better still; dont give the creators of the game a penny ever! They'll just♥♥♥♥♥♥away every shred of hope you have in them.			"

Posted: February 23, 2015
												I REALLY badly wanted to like this game and sunk alot of hours into it because there's so many post-apocalyptic survival DayZ reskins and you're just hoping one of them will do it right.  We all know the formula and want one them to not flop. Sadly this game is one of the many that's failed thusfar.  I'm glad I got it for a steal but I could never recommend it.Here's a list of issues:1) The PVP aspect is ruined due to hackers.  I ended up not spending much time with that for obvious reasons.2) There's like 10 guns in the whole game.  The best are unlocked with crafting (rather than the P2W shop thrown in) which is kinda cool but such a lack of variety gets boring fast.3) Storage space is far too limiting.  Storage and cash are the only things that pass onto your next characters after you die.  That's nice in theory, but the largest backpack you can have gives more space than storage does.  That makes it so you can only get a small arsenal together before you've maxed out.4) There's basically no loot or monsters.  It is pretty easy to go for hours at a time without finding a single lootable item or monster.  Loot is global which means when one person searches a spot its gone for a while.  Therefore, you need to go to unpopulated parts of the map to make looting better but even then you're getting 1-2 spots per every other block max.  The spawn rate for enemies is also pretty low so you very quickly abandon any notions of stealth and, more often than not, will find yourself sprinting across the map in the hopes you encounter anything to fight.5)  It's really poorly optimized.  I have a decent computer that runs games like Rome 2 on ultra settings without problems but I found myself needing to be on basic graphics for this game to be the least bit playable.6) There's really low incentive to keep playing once ""end-game"".  I can't say if I ever hit there, but from what I'd found through others, I'd hit a point where I had the best gun(s), a backup set, and enough money to buy food until the end of time.  From then on, all I could do was kill things to increase my account level.  Account level adds perks to new characters, but if you're already maxed level on a character I don't see why I'd want to make another.7) Bugs.  Horrible game-ruining bugs.  It's easy to tolerate the lighter ones... Whether it's the dragon-monster that doesn't flap its wings and just skates through the air for no reason, enemies clipping through walls because Why not, or not being able to loot items that give you the prompt.  Bugs like THAT are tolerable, although still disheartening.  However, the reason I quit this game and wrote this review was because of what just occurred to me.  I had died and lost my primary set of gear and was onto my second set.  No big deal since it was my fault I died.  However, the game crashed on me while I was looting to replace my primary set.  When I logged back in, I was shocked to find that the crash had led to my character being reset to level 1.  Lo and behold, my storage was missing my secondary set of gear, so I had effectively been robbed of all my useful gear and all the items I had tried to loot back.  Effectively, I was brought back to square one because this game failed on me....And all of this still occurs in a game that has been deemed ""stable"" by its developers.  Do not play this game or buy from the company who made this game.			"

												Lets take this from someone who has played the game for more than 0.2 hours. The games is indeed a sandbox mixed with your survival. Yes the Cons being hackers and the devs left. The Pros are the PVE servers where you don't have to worry about hackers. The only thing they can do is speed hack, infinite inv and one shot. In PVE it doesn't matter, but the speed hack provides an unfair advantage. That being you get places slower. Other than that you can benefit from other players, find new friends and the community is good from what I've seen. This game is great and you shouldn't let the people complaining steer you away.

												Sort of reccommended. PVE has brought this game from♥♥♥♥♥♥to meh. Further updates may improve my disposition. As for now, party system is broken, Nether spawns have been nerfed to hell, I should not be able to sprint around without issues as I currently can, reload sounds are bugged on the semi-auto shotgun, and the list goes on but I am too lasy to type any more. I still recommend this game b/c I see improvements being made and still have high hopes for the future.			"

Early Access Review
								where do I begin...let's start with who should play this game. short answer? no one with a decent bone in their body. that being said once you've had a chance to do away with any sort of decency you have as a human being you are ready to begin.you start off with nothing. which, btw, everyone who has been playing this game will galdly kill you for as soon as they see your green backpack-wearing, kitchen knife-wielding dumb♥♥♥♥♥slogging half-heartedly across the urban landscape.after you've died numerous times you think you've got the hang of things. at this point you'll probably level up a couple times, feel pretty good, then die a couple more times just so you don't feel too good about yourself.now you're at an impasse. do you continue playing this merciless game or do you move on to something that was much cheaper and much more fun? if you chose the former, continue reading.you eventually learn how to play, swing your kitchen knife, narrowly avoid being gunned down by bands or loners who find their purpose solely to gun down anyone that they see, and eventually max out your character. now you can actually play a game. you get your hodge-podge of gear together, check around to make sure no one is following you or camping just outside and make a dash for the nearest building. once outside the warm embrace of not being dead you decide to try and make something. gather enough parts to make a cool gun or trade for some ammo, maybe even afford a cool wing suit that you saw fly in gracefully before the player connected to it dropped on your head with a shotgun to your face.anyways, now you're on your way to playing Nether.until you see some more blood spatters appear on your screen, a moment of confusion registering on your irl face before finally realizing you've once again fallen victim to that one guy who always seems to have a sniper rifle, plenty of ammo, and a thing for killing players.have fun.

												I dont know what has happened to this game now :(it honestly started off amazing, it was well designed, alot more enjoyable, servers were amazing. Their used to be a time long ago where there was about 20-30 seervers, and now its just 3... i do love the game, but seriously. add some servers again. you add no god damn AP servers, all you do is support US servers. there are other players in Aus that want to play without 100+ ping. And another thing, why am i still seeing hackers in secured servers.. this is a jokei paid $18 for this when it first came out. i happily paid that because the game was starting off amazing. now i wouldnt pay over $3 for it :/bring back te old nether. it was beautiful and sooo much better and bring back dem AP servers <3 please.

												Just a little preface before starting this review, I have never played this game, just wanted to let all of you guys and gals that now. I wouldn't be surprised if you stopped reading the review right now, but I felt that I say my peace on this game. So, to the ""review"".I made an awful mistake picking it up. I really should have looked more into the game on youtube, or even better, read the reviews below the store page. I couldnt even play it. I know, why write a review if you havnt played it? Well it didnt start, thats why. Exactly why it didnt start I dont know, but I know that whatever was causing it wasn't suppose to be happening. I'd log in and the only thing that would happen was there would be a large black square on my screen. It would also force me to restart my copmputer entirely. But why be suprised, right? So many games are being released on Steam that are barely working. This game is just another piece of garbage on Steam that some how qualifies to be sold to the public.  Steam has to stop releasing broken and buggy games, I'm getting sick of it. Remember WarZ anyone?			"

												I came to love this game even in it's broken state when the devs still had it in hand hoping they would keep working on it.Unfortunately that didn't happen they abandoned it and milked it for all it was worth.So what's left is player run servers, no anti-cheat and a dying player base. Although some people including me keep coming back when there are enough people on the pvp servers just because we love this game so much.So whenever this game is on sale pls if you have the money try to get some friends involved cause the 4 pack(I do believe there is one) if great value not too expensive and hopefully we can get a steady decent playerbase cause I think it's so much fun. And who knows someday someone will wanna pick up where the previous devs gave up.			"

												Totally unplayable. I bought it back during the summer sale when it was only $2.99 and I wish I had bought some other game instead. I installed the game, created an account, and when I log in, it says ""Status: Launching game"". Did it launch the game? Hell no! Did I wait for a long♥♥♥♥♥time? Hell yeah! Should I get a refund? Hell yeah! Should any more people buy this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hell no!I searched the forums for a fix but it seems that it's on the game's end, not mine since other players are experiencing the same thing. I bought this game in early access and was hoping to get into it. The first time I installed this was a week after I bought it and it didn't run. Of course I uninstalled it and never touched it again. NOW, I decided to reinstall it and look for a fix. Instead, I just see forum threads of players like me complaining about the same bug.I don't think the developers are doing anything about it, and probably never will.. Here's to wishful thinking that the game will be fixed and that my $2.99 wasn't a waste!			"

Servers are deserted and I still get kicked out often without any notification that im out of the game. Had to find out that when I walked across the world and couldn't interact with npc's. Also had 2 game crashes, 1 right at the start and 1 because I had backpack full but tried to pick up 1 more item. Seems like the developers gave up to make this game work. I really liked the games atmosphere but they screwed up bigtime.			"

Early Access Review
								PLEASE DO NOT ADD ME FOR BETA KEYS ANYMORE. I RAN OUT OF KEYS.THIS REVIEW IS MASSIVELY OUTDATED. I HAVE NOT PLAYED THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE GAME AND I AM UNABLE TO GIVE YOU A CONSTRUCTIVE REVIEW ON THIS. The only reason I leave this review here is because it shows you my experience with the game before it got released to what it is right now.Okay, lets actually write an honest review why YOU should buy this game.Nether.Nether is NOT your generic DayZ survival game if you already thought this was something like that.No, I believe Nether offers you a complete different view and style on a survival game.The game goal is pretty simple. You spawn in an apocalyptic setting in Burnam. It is you. A survivor of an unknown event called ""The cull"" The cull created human mutations and abominations.. called the Nether. You have to survive. Simple as that. However, you will find that this 'survive' I am talking about is pretty hard. There are many Nether out there in the world. Big ones. Small ones. Flying ones. Stealthy ones and even ones that make a bloody shriek to call in other Nether to let you know your funeral has arrived. If you think that the Nether already scares you off then let me tell you. The players are worse. If it is not a Golem that is smacking your face in it will be fully geared up player with all the weapons you can only DREAM of having. This game is completely filled with tension till the very end. You know♥♥♥♥♥♥is about to get down when you hear the roar of incoming Nether.Now, Patchy, I thought you were going to tell me what WOULD make me interested in the game?Well the thing is, the game offers you quite a unique experience in a survival game. You have some generic things. Health, hunger and stamina. Of course you need to eat to stay alive. But you can also level up your character. You gain experience by killing Nether, doing tasks or objectives and even just staying alive gives you experience. You can adjust and suit your character in ANY way you like! And trust me, you will die so many times that you eventually have tried out alot. This game has also some crafting methods. Can't seem to find a good gun? Don't worry! you can craft it by finding the right components or even trade Nether bones, skins, and blood for good ammo and guns at the misterious Nether cult in any safe zones. Oh yeah! The safe zones! In safe zones, you are safe. That is untill they are randomly attacked and are not safe anymore for 60 min. Enjoy your not so safe zones!Another fun feature they recently added are Tribes. In game you can join a Tribe. Tribe offers you rewards, quests and other alliances with other tribes. The rewards will be GREATLY. You can earn reputation among your tribe and get cool loot. HOWEVER they recently added it and have not really been working on it alot. This game is in BETA. They are constantly updating it and adding more and more content! In the next update they are expanding the map, adding a wasteland and actually adding terrorial control to Tribes, offering hourly incomes of cash wich you can spend to upgrade your gear or resupply.But Patchy, this DOES sound like my avarage survival DayZ game! I will tell you what.The graphics are stunning. (The lightning and shadows are a bit iffy still)The gameplay is really tense and exciting. (you never know whats around that corner!)The level system is fun and challenging! (God I love the Melee skill tree)And the game challenges mentally to prepare for decisions along your path. (should I make it to the next safe zone? Should I camp around here? I dont know!)Longest♥♥♥♥♥♥I've ever wrote.			"

Also the graphic is a little blurry, the Nethers are just boring. And i didn't feel the ""apocalypse"" theme. Maybe if the developers work on it a little more, i'll give it a try.

												With any early-access game, you should expect a profuse abundance of bugs, glitches, and crashes. But at the time of writing, this game isn't just buggy; it's completely non-functional. Even the sign-up form on the start-up screen was broken, forcing me to go to the Nether website to create my account there instead. And after several crashes, when I finally managed to launch the game, the tutorial mission was broken, and it wouldn't even allow me to sign up for a tribe. I barely even got to see any gameplay at all.While the graphics and mechanics look promising, and the game may very well turn out wonderfully when it's fully released and free to play, Nether is not (as of now) enough of a finished product to justify the price they charge for early access.

The only downside about this game is that dying is so easy that it's just frustrating after collecting loot for 20 hours to die. Thats the only reason I havent played this game more then a couple of hours.			"

Posted: February 15, 2016
												A true review by one who has faced the NETHER.I steered clear of this game for along time. The pictures looked cool, The idea sounded fun, but other reviews kept me from getting it. Then I saw that the developers had changed and I went under recent reviews, saw alot of thumbs up, saw the game was 5 bucks and said time to try it. How the game works: You start the game and must deliever a package,..about 3 in all for the tutorial. These packages are randomly throughout the safe zones (a place where you cannot kill or be killed by other players, monster etc) Delievering packages earns you expeirence and money. The XP is used to make your character stamina, strength, stealth, etc higher. The money is used to purchase guns, ammo, gear, backpacks, etc. Its basically grinding to make your character stronger. Like some kind of world of warcraft game these safezones have NPC shop keepers, who never move or say anything. Once you have what you need, guns and things of the sort ( you can essentially carry 1 ranged weapon, 1 side arm, and 1 melee weapon) you go off to kill other players and monsters of the world. WARNING: If you die, you lose it ALL. I mean EVERYTHING..your character was level 30 and you could run fast and far, not anymore..level 1. Cant run for♥♥♥♥♥♥ and have lost all you worked for.The NETHERThey are something not of this world, they sound great, there seems to be about 5 or 6 different types, and they teleport around while you shoot at them. You have your flyers, bosses, screaming one that charge right at you, some spit, goliaths that look like the Hulk, Wierd zombie ones that explode and arent fast. There is a variety. Safezones can become under attack by hordes of them if the anti nether devices in the safezone fail. (they are electronic thingamajigs that prevent the Nether from being able to come into the area) It will require teamwork in order to get the safezones back up and running. There are Nether surges where they become more frequent in certian areas. Some areas of the map have them all over the place and they never stop comming. No matter how many you kill. Other parts of the map, you may not see them at all, or will see them randomly. If they hit you, it can be devasting, you get around 1,000hp and a single hit can bring you down 300 to 400hp. So get smacked 2 or 3 times and your done. However guns are very effective often requiring 1 to 5 shots to kill them.LOOTYou can find loot in the world, just like any other survival game, If something has loot in it like a car, it blinks and it shiney, I do not like they way they did the loot, Im use to actually hunting for items, checking under beds etc, and at first it was a turn off, and it felt odd, but after you get an hour or so under your belt, you just get use to it. And it doesnt matter as much anymore, Im sure they will change it later on in the alpha. Loot can be sold at traders for pennies on the dollar. Hunger system is 1 system, so rather you drink water, or eat canned food it all goes toward the same thing. There are alot of different helmets but as far as your body, it cant be changed much. The small amount of body customization will be done at the character menu not in game. Also at the moment whatever you get (like a new helmet or mask) you must log out and then log back in for it show up on your chracter.MAPWhen you first look at it and are new it looks huge. However alot of it isnt accessible at the moment. And so it slowly shrinks as you figure it out and increase speed and stamina to cover distances quicker. The city is done really well. I praise the visuals. Small things like grass overgrown on the roads, abandoned cars parked in traffic jams for miles. Giant skyscrapers that you can get to the top of. Its the small things..going into a room and seeing 2 dead bodies on the ground clinging to one another showing their finals moments spent on earth holding each other in comfort. Its a great atmosphere, black smoke billowing from building that can be seen for miles. Downed resue choppers still burning. Police barricades no longer in service. Its all there, its all really cool. I praise the draw distance, something that I cannot say for a game like H1z1. There is a city area, its decent sized, bigger then any city in any other game including arma/dayz. But as I said the map itself is smaller. The other area would be right outside the city, some kind of marshes, or lowlands. Its not as interesting to me, but its a change of pace and still not bad. Ambulances have lights still flashing, and some signs still flicker like at gas stations etc. MechanicsGun play is suprisingly good. Its smooth, its solid, and it feels out of place because I am use to crappy gun play like h1z1. ( I like h1z1 btw) shooting is actually fun and you feel as if you have full control. Another interesting concept is tribes. You can join a tribe, there is around 10 tribes. This gives you allies in the form of your fellow pvp killers. There is a PVE mode aswell, I recommend starting there until you udnerstand the game. There is enough in it to make it worth while without getting bored right off the bat becuase the NETHER can be fun to fight. There are buildings that you can capture, and take from other tribes. If you do this, the surrounding area becomes your territory. The benifit of this, is you get extra rewards. Example...find 30 bucks in your territory and get an extra 15 dollars intop of it as a bonus. Find 30 bucks in an unfriendly territory and you only get 30 bucks. There are random world events that take place such as Nether surges, bosses, and ofcourse safezones being attacked. At whichpoint you can enter the safzone guns ablazing. Something you are robbed of when it isnt under attack. There are vehicles in the game, But I know nothing of them I didnt even see or hear one til hour 10 of gameplay when I heard the roar of an engine looked out a window and some dude rolled by in a buggy or something. So, apparently there is a way to get a car.FINAL THOUGHTSFor 5 bucks...snatch this game up!!!!!!!! Micro transactions and alot of the things listed in the negative reviews when the other developer had it are GONE. And I quote the new developer (who was the original developers and sold it then saw the abomination there game had become and took it back) ""we got rid of that microtransaction ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"" I like when somebody refers to it in such a way. I never played or owned it during the bad times, so I dont know what was going on with the game then, But I hope this review makes it to the top, to negate the other reviews that were accurate at the time and good reviews but are now no longer relevant. For the game has changed.			"

The game is all about sneaking around, scrounging for resources while combating and avoiding both man and monster in a post-apocalyptic, moody and tension-filled setting. The game provides players with a strong atmosphere, reminiscent of Metro and STALKER.The setting may be fantastic, but the gameplay is far from perfect. While gunplay is acceptable, melee combat can only be described as wonky. There’s a fairly well done stealth system, but this does not help you level in any way.While Nether’s creeping around, looting and shooting down monsters in a post-apocalyptic world sounds good it does not hold up well in practice.On a technical level, there are a lot of issues both in terms of performance and bugs. Frame rates regularly drop too low to be acceptable, even on a high end rig. However the biggest problem is the multiply player, no holds-barred, survival experience. Nether was hyped as a co-op experience, but unfortunately that is rarely the case. More often than not you will die at the hands of another player. Sometimes a random player you don't see coming, but also from players you thought were joining in the co-op spirit and who you thought had teamed up with you. They have a habit of backstabbing you and robbing you when you don't expect it. You may say, ""all's fair in love and gaming"" but consider this: when you die you re-spawn at a random location with only a knife and have to restart your skill tree from scratch. Yes, every time you die. While I'm sure some people will love this it gets old very quickly. To make this even worse, just getting out of the spawn area can be a nightmare with other players camping about picking you off when all you have is a knife. Worse is the fact that there seems to be absolutely no control over cheaters. Lots of people using aim-bots and hacks spoil an already marred experience.The real shame of it is, I think that there is the basis of a really great PVE co-op game here.Where is the co-op game I was hoping for?Why are there no PVE only servers?Why can't they stop the hackers?

												A true review by one who has faced the NETHER.I steered clear of this game for along time. The pictures looked cool, The idea sounded fun, but other reviews kept me from getting it. Then I saw that the developers had changed and I went under recent reviews, saw alot of thumbs up, saw the game was 5 bucks and said time to try it. How the game works: You start the game and must deliever a package,..about 3 in all for the tutorial. These packages are randomly throughout the safe zones (a place where you cannot kill or be killed by other players, monster etc) Delievering packages earns you expeirence and money. The XP is used to make your character stamina, strength, stealth, etc higher. The money is used to purchase guns, ammo, gear, backpacks, etc. Its basically grinding to make your character stronger. Like some kind of world of warcraft game these safezones have NPC shop keepers, who never move or say anything. Once you have what you need, guns and things of the sort ( you can essentially carry 1 ranged weapon, 1 side arm, and 1 melee weapon) you go off to kill other players and monsters of the world. WARNING: If you die, you lose it ALL. I mean EVERYTHING..your character was level 30 and you could run fast and far, not anymore..level 1. Cant run for♥♥♥♥♥♥ and have lost all you worked for.The NETHERThey are something not of this world, they sound great, there seems to be about 5 or 6 different types, and they teleport around while you shoot at them. You have your flyers, bosses, screaming one that charge right at you, some spit, goliaths that look like the Hulk, Wierd zombie ones that explode and arent fast. There is a variety. Safezones can become under attack by hordes of them if the anti nether devices in the safezone fail. (they are electronic thingamajigs that prevent the Nether from being able to come into the area) It will require teamwork in order to get the safezones back up and running. There are Nether surges where they become more frequent in certian areas. Some areas of the map have them all over the place and they never stop comming. No matter how many you kill. Other parts of the map, you may not see them at all, or will see them randomly. If they hit you, it can be devasting, you get around 1,000hp and a single hit can bring you down 300 to 400hp. So get smacked 2 or 3 times and your done. However guns are very effective often requiring 1 to 5 shots to kill them.LOOTYou can find loot in the world, just like any other survival game, If something has loot in it like a car, it blinks and it shiney, I do not like they way they did the loot, Im use to actually hunting for items, checking under beds etc, and at first it was a turn off, and it felt odd, but after you get an hour or so under your belt, you just get use to it. And it doesnt matter as much anymore, Im sure they will change it later on in the alpha. Loot can be sold at traders for pennies on the dollar. Hunger system is 1 system, so rather you drink water, or eat canned food it all goes toward the same thing. There are alot of different helmets but as far as your body, it cant be changed much. The small amount of body customization will be done at the character menu not in game. Also at the moment whatever you get (like a new helmet or mask) you must log out and then log back in for it show up on your chracter.MAPWhen you first look at it and are new it looks huge. However alot of it isnt accessible at the moment. And so it slowly shrinks as you figure it out and increase speed and stamina to cover distances quicker. The city is done really well. I praise the visuals. Small things like grass overgrown on the roads, abandoned cars parked in traffic jams for miles. Giant skyscrapers that you can get to the top of. Its the small things..going into a room and seeing 2 dead bodies on the ground clinging to one another showing their finals moments spent on earth holding each other in comfort. Its a great atmosphere, black smoke billowing from building that can be seen for miles. Downed resue choppers still burning. Police barricades no longer in service. Its all there, its all really cool. I praise the draw distance, something that I cannot say for a game like H1z1. There is a city area, its decent sized, bigger then any city in any other game including arma/dayz. But as I said the map itself is smaller. The other area would be right outside the city, some kind of marshes, or lowlands. Its not as interesting to me, but its a change of pace and still not bad. Ambulances have lights still flashing, and some signs still flicker like at gas stations etc. MechanicsGun play is suprisingly good. Its smooth, its solid, and it feels out of place because I am use to crappy gun play like h1z1. ( I like h1z1 btw) shooting is actually fun and you feel as if you have full control. Another interesting concept is tribes. You can join a tribe, there is around 10 tribes. This gives you allies in the form of your fellow pvp killers. There is a PVE mode aswell, I recommend starting there until you udnerstand the game. There is enough in it to make it worth while without getting bored right off the bat becuase the NETHER can be fun to fight. There are buildings that you can capture, and take from other tribes. If you do this, the surrounding area becomes your territory. The benifit of this, is you get extra rewards. Example...find 30 bucks in your territory and get an extra 15 dollars intop of it as a bonus. Find 30 bucks in an unfriendly territory and you only get 30 bucks. There are random world events that take place such as Nether surges, bosses, and ofcourse safezones being attacked. At whichpoint you can enter the safzone guns ablazing. Something you are robbed of when it isnt under attack. There are vehicles in the game, But I know nothing of them I didnt even see or hear one til hour 10 of gameplay when I heard the roar of an engine looked out a window and some dude rolled by in a buggy or something. So, apparently there is a way to get a car.FINAL THOUGHTSFor 5 bucks...snatch this game up!!!!!!!! Micro transactions and alot of the things listed in the negative reviews when the other developer had it are GONE. And I quote the new developer (who was the original developers and sold it then saw the abomination there game had become and took it back) ""we got rid of that microtransaction ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"" I like when somebody refers to it in such a way. I never played or owned it during the bad times, so I dont know what was going on with the game then, But I hope this review makes it to the top, to negate the other reviews that were accurate at the time and good reviews but are now no longer relevant. For the game has changed.			"

												Ok so I have been questioning whether or not I should do a review for this game and I hae decided why not. So let us get one thing straight, this game is still pretty good but it was so much better. Back when it was in Alpha it was a strong game with a lot of potential. The concept was good, the mechanics i.e. looting, crafting where all good, the nether (the main enemy) was and still is a good idea. So why then does it feel now that it is unfinished, glitchy, buggy and too some degree just a broken game full of people killing each other. This game has become less about killing or surviving against the nether and more hunting other players down and killing them again and again and again. Some players in this game, dont want to fight, instead they want to do what made Nether good; loot, craft, survive and so on. The game makes not attempt to ensure that it doesnt become a cluster of death. The nether are barely in it now, it is literally whoever has the biggest gun wins, and in truth that doesnt appeal to me. Should you buy and play Nether? I would say no, dont buy this game, really dont, it is frustrating on a few levels. The mechanics are still there just not emphasised enough, the concept of the ganme; survive, pits you against players more than it does the nether (this is usually done in a situation when you get shot at repeatedly without knowing where your shooter is OR when you have a lot of stuff or no stuff). The game just feels rushed and broken. It WAS good, really it was. It could still be good but because of the rushed nature of its development from Alpha to release it still has a lot of broken parts to fix. I hope this review has helped, it's a shame because it used to be a good game. One more thing if you choose to buy this game here are some tips from 65 hours of playing, stay away from Riverside Trading Outpost as this is where you will die, if you have a gun and you see a player with a gun...shoot first as this is where you will die, dont sprint that much as this attracts the nether as this is where you will die and if you have no loot or items go to the subways as this is where you can find some stuff,			"

Early Access Review
								My review for Nether  I have expressed my opinions on this game alot on the discussions page only to be silenced by the moderators for simply saying that Dayz (mod) is superior to this horrible game in every way. I have sunk over 200 into dayz even with its many bugs i found it a hell of a lot more enjoyable than this game that looks and plays like infestation survivor stories.The game is basically a boring environment with enterable buildings that just look plain horrible, Floor upon floor of nothing.the game is like a huge deathmatch with a hunger system.

												I bought this game based on a RPS article detailing how it was an open world survival game with goals and pve scenarios to complete.  Well that really wasn't the case at all.The world is pretty amazing, and the Nether are frightening to run into.  Besides that though there isn't much to the game.  The developers made this amazing looking world that occasionally has an enemy or a base to go to, with like two objectives no one does because either they are afraid to get picked off, or are sitting outside the objective waiting to pick people off.  Most weapons are locked behind a paywall, and why exactly would you pay for something you will lose 3 seconds after leaving your base because everybody kills you on site.  The whole objective system is completely pointless if everyone is just using that opportunity to kill the other players and steal their items.  On top of that hackers are all over the place, and you can just be exploring or hiding and magically die from somebody far off in the distance.I think I paid about $13 for this game and totally regret it.  They probably should update the description of the game, it's misleading.  The game is just chaos and is only fun for the hackers.  They need to pick a focus and build the game around it.  Don't buy this game.			"

												What kills this game is the player base that is either hacking the game or camping near the protected zones to which you as a newbie must go in order to get coins and craft better gear. It may not sound so bad, but it is in fact ruining the game to such a point that it rewards the camping behaviour - If you're first on a server and can rush to get a gun (ranged weapon) then all you need to do is sit down and wait for other players to do the work for you and you get to kill them and pick their gear. It is not much from the rookies, but well worth it as you don't have to play the game or make anything of it.The concept of this game is likeable, but the players are incetivised to ruin the game by camping and killing new gamers.My recommendation - Do not buy this game until they can come up with a viable model that allows new players to get at least a fighting chance - At the moment you are given a Butter Knife and expected to fight camping players geared with Sniper Rifles.Note for the developers - How about enticing geared players to go further away from the safe zones but having more/better loot and challenges, so that new players can at least get a little sporting chance of maybe getting a ranged weapon?

												first of all, this game is still under development. I have been plaing this game during its first phases and have to say that it is improving by every update. I am writing this review upon seeing many bad and insidious reviews during the summer-sale.Nether:cons:- like I said, its still under development. Some parts are still being worked on. some areas in the game are glitched, you may get stuck (however you can get out if you have a glider). The cars are also glitched so driving them is at your own risk.- there are some hackers in the game, but the Nether-Team is trying its best to resolve the situation.- as a new player you will have a bad time. You do not know your surroundings and a lot of Players are killing you on sight, rather than staying friendly. But this is part of the game, getting to know the city and the areas that can be a threat and where to find usable loot. If you have a bigger backpack and some good guns on you, other Players will make you their target just to get your equipment.pros:- the athmosphere of the world is breathtakingly scary. The post-apocalyptic scenario is done very well.- this game is not a pay-to-win! You may buy ingame currency however this only gets you different clothing and no advanteage whatsoever. Everything else you can get in the game by collecting loot.- looting the areas/ crafting the guns is very rewarding.- you can level up your account and not lose your progress. However you lose your character level upon death. I like this hardcore aspect of the game. If you die, you loose your gear and start over again.- playing in a group or with friends is a lot more fun than sinlge player. However as a group you may not always have the upper-hand. You can always get into an ambush and a sinlge player can take out your entire group. So the aspect of tactics and communication is very imoprtant.this is not a game you should take on lighthearted. It needs your full attention or you just might see yourself shot in the back or a group of Nether chasing you down the streets.			"

												So, I got this game for about 3 bucks, and for that much, I don't know how much I can really complain, but seriously, if it said early access, I could have excused a lot, but being sold as a finished product? Not sure if I can really say the same thing.Right off the bat, I get to wait for the launcher to load, then I have to register for another ♥♥♥♥ing account, then I have to wait for the launcher to accept my login… then wait about 10 minutes for the menu to load… so I can select a server to join… then to wait again for it to load in the world. The time it takes to get in game is like 20-25 minutes in total, which for a game being sold as “finished” is just inexcusable unless you are a grand strategy game and that’s just how long it takes for you to read the novel of instructions. Then when I start in a server, I see right away “oh there are going to be micro-transactions, and Jesus, is there a way to turn off that vignette? And is there another color to this game besides brown?” I then spawn in, and get a nice little pop-up letting me know that this is the tutorial and to deliver the package to a person in the safe zone. Awesome I thought, this should be easy, get some early loot, then head off and adventure. Nope. Take two steps forward and get absolutely wrecked by about 10 monsters. I spawn in again, same safe zone, thinking “Well maybe I stumbled out of it, or maybe it was just a glitch”. Nope. Get wrecked again, turns out that safe zones can be invaded by monsters and the apparently you can fight them off, but good luck figuring out how to do that with the kitchen knife you spawn in with. The game has no issue with spawning you into un-safe “safe zones” when there are perfectly tenable safe zones elsewhere. It does give you the option of spawning randomly, but it almost has the same problem, “great now I don’t get to die instantly, I just get to either starve to death, or I get to take my chances with the flying things, hmm decisions decisions”. A few deaths later the random spawn actually placed me within distance of a real safe zone, where I was able to finally see those NPCs I was supposed to be turning the quest into. And apparently this game takes place in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R universe because every NPC on the planet wears a black or brown hoodie and scarf, it’s almost as if modeling faces is kind of hard. Anyway, after turning in the first quest, I was given another, and the quest description pointed me back towards the city, however I was able to just walk to the next shop over and turn in the quest, and I was finally rewarded with an actual weapon and water for once. Now at this point I was given a quest to go join a tribe, and instead of doing that, I decided to go out into the world and explore now that I was decently equipped with something other than a kitchen knife. The first few buildings I found were nothing special but I soon learned that the glowing containers were the ones containing loot. However, the game thinks “loot” means “the same two useless ♥♥♥♥ing items over and over again”, and while I understand the whole survival thing, this implies that survival might be possible and that you have some sort of higher goal, and now mine was “join tribe” and when I finally found the place to join one, I had officially won the game, time to exit out and uninstall. Seriously, the only thing to do once you get a gun and join a tribe is to shoot other players and possibly other monsters, if you get bored, which will probably be very fast since new players are few and far between in this barren landscape. Oh and speaking of landscape, I know some games have issues with clipping on tiny terrain objects, so the developers put in a jump button, or just make them inaccessible, this games idea to fix this issue is to just make your character float about 15 feet above any major obstacles, which breaks the immersion somewhat, but I can say of the many problems with this game, getting caught in clipping wasn’t one of them. But then sitting 15 above ground also gave me a nice view of the scenery, and hint: it wasn’t much to look at. Seriously, just get a brown piece of construction paper, eat some taco bell,  then take a messy♥♥♥♥♥♥on it, and bam, you got the world map for Nether. While I really didn’t expect “Skyrim with mods” levels of color and creativity, they could have spiced things up a little, maybe not copy pasting the same 4 or 5 buildings over and over again would be good start, and possibly making some interiors to random shops, so it would feel more like scavenging than playing hunt for the helicopter. And then why stop there, maybe make loot really mean something, other than a means to acquire shotgun barrels, seriously I feel like the apocalypse in this game was caused by raining shotgun barrels more than monsters. In the space of 20 or so minutes I had acquired 11 shotgun barrels with no purpose other than to sell at the shop for more water bottles. And thats basiclly what the bulk of my time was, flooding the shotgun barrel market and buying up shares in the water bottle industry.I’ll stop ranting, but seriously this game needs work or a few rounds in the back of the skull. Probably the latter. "

												I have invested a good amount of hours into this game.  I would like to briefly state what is good and what is bad about it.The Good - Atmosphere, Environment, Empty Cities, Exploration, Post-Apocalypse, Monsters, Survival, Gritty, Dark, and huge amounts of potential if in the right devs hands.  I mainly like it because it has some similarites to the dark feel of the STALKER series.The Bad - The hackers, The lack of support and patches, The frustration of losing all your progress after each death, the amount of people who hack/kill innocents/ruin the game for everyone.This game could have been so awesome if it was in the right hands! But until they fix any of that, well I would say steer clear.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~June 6 2016 UPDATE REVIEW After reading the three comments of those who told me to give the game a second chance now that is in new hands, I will be reinstalling Nether to see the changes and differences that have been made.  Now that there is PVE and Single Plyer mode with Coop for friends only, I just might have a change of heart! To be continued!			"

												This is probably one of the worst survival games out on the market.Why?Well, the game is very similar to Infestation: Survivor Stories.You run around, loot stuff, get weapons and later you get killed by a hacker.The gameplay feels terrible, as the whole movement system feels very slow and unresponsive.There are tons of bugs, the hit detection is bad (some monsters hit you even if you are 10 meters away), the design of the monsters is very uninspired and the whole game looks pretty bad.A lot of areas are recycled and therefore feel very repetetive.Oh yeah, of course the game contains mircrotransactions, because this is obviously, what everybody wants in a survival game.I could list a lot more problems, but overall:The game is just not fun, it actually is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to play.Do not waste your money on this, except you want to play something really bad.

												I bought this game three years ago with high hopes of a new survival horror game. The screenshots and previews we had seen were amazing and I couldn't be happier, Then I had soon found out that this was essentially a Pay2Win. To get good gear you literally had to purchase it, From purchasing cosmetics to equipment it was a very tedious and non fun experience. Even with them changing the game and updating it, I still feel conned. They banned me from their forums when i asked why my account was locked out and they refused to refund the $40 i payed when it first came out. Despicable.			"

												TEN THUMBS DOWN. THIS GAME IS COMPLETE GARBAGE. After starting the game up to a black screen that would need to be closed by task manager and trying again to only get a completely unresponsive or barely functioning menu. When i finally was able to get into the game, It was in a 'specatator mode' with a completely crappy environment which i was told was a bug and went to take a shower until it worked, which was 20 minutes later. Upon playing the game, I found out that there was nearly nothing to do, All the mechanics blew me away how bad they were, like falling out of a 50 story skyscraper and taking no damage, or holding 'e' as prompted which got no response. On top of all this, the AI is utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I could barely squeeze out 30 fps on minimum crappy settings (which actually looked laughable), on a PC that can easily max most demanding games. I'm pushing it by giving this game a 1/10, EASILY one of the worst games I've ever played and not even worth the $2.99 asking price.			"

												The idea of the survival game with monsters can be cool, but the fact that every player you meet shoots you immediatly sucks. There are friendzones there, where people can't shoot inside, so you hope you are safe in there. Sometimes these safezones can be attacked by monsters, and the players are supposed to collaborate to kill the monsters and make the zone safe again. But of course there are players who just wait the safezone to be attacked by the monsters to kill all the other players inside it, and steal all their stuff. This just sucks, if it's a safezone is a safezone, why the hell should people shoot the other players when it's attacked? This makes the game annoying and frustrating too, after you spent like hours to find and collect items to survive and craft new and stronger weapons, then comes some idiot who shoots you even if you are in a safezone... wow I really needed that, I can't live without shooting other people in safe places too. Speaking about other aspects, the game is still a lot broken, there are many crashes, and many times you can't even join the servers. Congratulations to the developers, I really feel to thank them to have thrown a good idea in the garbage with all these wonderful things. The only positive side of all this is that I payed this game 2 euros. 3/10			"

												When we all bought Nether, as a group, my friends and I loved it. Played it every waking moment. It was a game that bandits and heroes alike enjoyed waking up to play. That changed after a patch introduced a game breaking bug that wasn't fixed for the longest time, where you could prone and become invincible. Then, the hacker problem began to arise from this. Not to mention money exploits where you could get so much money that you could simply buy the best gear and meds, and all you had to do was find guns. After this was the hitbox breaking. You couldn't shoot anyone who was jumping and half of your shots on stationary players and things wouldn't register. Now, the only thing keeping the old community from playing is the hacker issue that we get no direct acknowledgement of from the developers. The game is dead in it's current state. It is no longer as fun as it used to be, maybe not even at all. Hackers will keep coming and reducing the price to ""NOW 9.99!!!!"" won't help unless Phosphor is damn sure of it's anticheat. Or whoever runs the game anymore.Edit as of 6/24/2015: Clearly the developers have abandoned / have little care for the game, seeing as the last update at all for the game was over 6 months ago, going on about 10 to a year. The game is dead, regardless of who still plays it, it is dead.Edit as of 2016: The game was picked up by the original developers again in an attempt to remarket the game as ""Nether: Resurrected."" While the game lasted for a solid 2 months under this nomenclature, and I ran the most popular US server for the game, it eventually went under and is no longer receiving updates. I applaud Phosphor, the developers, for attempting to revive the game and giving us the ability to run our own servers as a community, but sadly the game is permanently dead, topping out at around 15 people TOTAL playing the game across all servers combined.So as a result, I'm not going to recommend the game to anybody and suggest you do not buy this game unless you want to play it for single player PvE purposes.

												#CzechMomentálně hru hluboce nedoporučuji ... Hra není plně propojená se Steamem a když se chcete připojit do hry, musíte se registrovat na jejich webu a přihlašovat přes externího klienta. Neumí si zapamatovat heslo, takže při velmi častých pádech hry které budete zažívat vás to začne štvát. Menu je primitivní, skládá se jen ze serverlistu. Aby jste mohli hru jakkoliv nastavit, musíte se připojit do hry. Severlist je sám  sobě zalagovaný a nebýt fixu, který si musíte udělat sami, čekali by jste dlouhé hodiny jako já dříve. Servery vás z nepochopitelného důvodu vyhazují zpátky do menu bez jakékoliv chybové hlášky a vy tak ani nevíte co se děje (a ano opět se znovu načítá pomalý server list). Když se připojíte na server, nemáte zdaleka vyhráno. Dost se stává, že se bugnete ve Spectator modu a nemůžete nic dělat. Pomůže jen alt+F4. Ve hře máte i magickou schopnost, která vám umožní procházet skrz textury, stoly, skříně, kameny a dokonce i ploty.Hra má velký potenciál a skvělou atmosféru (noční procházka v hrobovém tichu - boží), ale příšerně ji ničí lagy a bugy. Bohužel jsou to věci, které nejdou jen tak přehlédnout. Doufám, že na tom vývojáři rychle zapracují, protože hra se chová jako ve stádiu Alphy. #EnglishI don't recommend buying this game at full price right now. This game looks like alpha version. Nether have great potential and awesome environment but he have a lot of bugs (you can run through tables, cabinets, fences or even rocks). Menu is primitive and have only lagging server list. If you want to customize setting you have to login on server.I hope that developers will repair all these bugs and lags because Nether could be great game. For now I don't recommend you this game.

												I haven't played even two hours of this and I can honestly say this game is trash in its current state. The idea is pretty nice and what the game has to offer WHEN it works is goof. There are so many glitches, that it really sucks out all the fun. It's frustrating when the game hangs upon trying to exit to the main menu, and you're suddenly unable to pick up items. On top of that it's  poorly optimized. I must also say that the environments are pretty blunt, even for a city. I would really like to play this, but as of now I cannot recommend this game.Update:The game is still dead. Devs promised to resurrect the game but that never really happend. Not much ha schanged, so do NOT buy this.			"

												I wish I could say that I had experienced this game to its fullest. The reason I have four hours of game play is because that was the only time I got to play the game. Recent changes have made it difficult to even enter the game. I used to be able to pop in, check out the scene, explore, fight and generally play the game. Now, I can't even enter a map due to ""server busy"" followed by a prompt disconnect. From what I did play, I found somewhat entertaining. I wish there were more mobs to hunt/kill and less PVP... because, let's face it....no one enjoys being killed repeatedly by the guy who bought the sniper rifle from the cash store over and over again....not because he gets anything from killing you but because he bought a sniper rifle from the cash store to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥ I did like the whole aspect of running around a desolate metropolis, entering ruined building in hopes to scavange food and weapons, all the while hoping not to encounter any Nether beasts.  If the focus was more towards the latter, I'd definately get behind this game..... if I could ever log on to it, that is.			"

												I would not recomend this game if you are not comfortable about hardcore pvp deathmatch. Wait... I thought this was a survival game..?Oh, it is but no one works together. The level gaps between the different players is so high that any new players on a server can probably last a good 45 minutes before they are instantly sniped by a random person. There is hardly a sense of survival as supplies are few and far between. I would love this game if not for the fact that by walking around, I am instantly a target for someone who somehow managed to survive long enough to acquire a sniper rifle.			"

												You know this game gets so much hate, I havent played in about a year and a half cause I kept getting spawn killed in the first 10 minutes of the game. I absolutely hated it. however with single player and the fact you can have custom servers not I love it cause now I can play with my friends without worry of us getting boned by douch bags. I give this game a solid 3 1/2 stars just cause of that. I would give more but I feel the skill system is lacking. although I do love the concept of account level and perma death			"

												I never did really review this game after played it for so long. Okay I'mma start with the simple points.PVP was actually pretty good and the hitboxes were responsive that being after they fixed it.PVE was not that good on the other hand. You had minimal dodging ability in melee combat and practically had to learn to sidestep or backstep at certain parts to avoid getting hammered in by certain Nethers. However Melee was quite fun and extremely damaging going up as to one hit Nether and Players from behind.Where did this game go wrong? Hackers. So easy to predict for any game. I can't speak for the Devs but either they couldn't repel them or didn't care and the game did go to♥♥♥♥♥♥ After being swapped multiple times across different and the same company they decided to get it back I think?Game right now? Well no one probably plays this anymore but it will always be here and you can host your own server with passwords so. If you ever feel like playing with a friend this game is quite fun but since the updates are gone you might not have the courage to play it anymore. It's extremely cheap now compared to when I bought it but I don't regret it. I just hope that one day. One day this game will be restored to it's former glory. If this game still exists when I get a degree in Programming I will make this game great again. That is if the devs are willing to part with this completely bungled garbage that I actually enjoyed.

												View my♥♥♥♥♥♥old review down below, I've unfortuenately had to change my review.when I decided to give this game a go with my friends, it was being 'resurected' and so much♥♥♥♥♥♥was going to be done to the game, soo much hope for nothing, it had development for like a whole month and a half then died again, the devs reaped a truckload of money from customers with false hopes and ditched it again, even their 'update' posts turned into the most unprofessional posts I'd ever seen, in one post they pretty much told us to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up.I regret buying this game when it was on sale, it looked worth the price I paid which was something like $2 and even at $2 it's not worth the money or the time, there are no admin tools, hacking is from what I'm told easy to do, the spawn system ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, and the game is quite unfair and unforgiving. Buy Rust or get Arma II:OA and play DayZ.0/10 don't waste your ♥♥♥♥ing time on this trash.-=My ♥♥♥♥♥♥ old review=-Pretty good, fairly intense at time, PvE servers are fun, Solo is alright, I personaly LOVE games like this but the one thing that always jars me about them is when you die.. you pretty much lose everything, Be nice to see games like this with indepth death settings to limit that, however, Dying in this game, you don't lose money or cosmetic items, however, you lose your entire inventory, levels, backpack, and perks, It's alot more fun with friends.Only other thing that irritates me is the random spawn system, it'd be nice if you logged out in in atleast Lakeside that you'd log back in there and have a chance to log into a different safe zone rathar than on random parts of the map, one thing that bothers me the most is you have the potential to spawn in danger, or if you have a full inventory and where browsing the shop then D/C, you get thrown into a random part of the map with all this gear you can easily lose.My friend tells me there might be Player-Hosting like L4D2 has for example so it'd be really nice to see that and have indepth settings to controll Death Penalties, Shop prices, Escort Rewards(?) Difficulty Settings, turn surges on or off, controlled logging(?), PvP or PvE, those kinds of things.-=Edit #1=-In Regards to Microtransactions if they ever do come back and hoping they don't, the only ones I'd approve of would be paying a small price to keep certain things on death, selective spawning, and maybe cosmetics that are also obtainable in the game. Unless they develop a way to achieve these via other methods such as account level, like account level 15 - Keep main hand on death, account level 20, keep sidearm on death, level 30, keep backpack, level 35, keep ammo and Aid items in your inventory which I believe would be pretty dope and make farming those package runs alot more worth it and maybe of course max account level you lose nothing other than your level and skill points, would deffinately make the game alot more fun in my opinion.but again in those regards, these should be disabled for PvP Servers or have the variables changed so Instead of always keeping your mainhead on death, while on a PvP enabled server you have a 50% or 25% chance to lose it, otherwise PvP will be boring and pointless.-----8.5/10 - 8.5 because I would like to see some of these things refined and such, great game otherwise.

Early Access Review
								an amazing experience for an open world pvp, i personally think its way better than dayz + better graphics, it might have some minor bugs here and there but over all totally worth buying it. if these bugs were to stay forever on this game i wouldnt even mind since its that good, on top of that its still in early access, meaning more mods and stuff are coming.  if you like to loot, kill and make clan or gang members then this is the game for you. (sorry for the bad english btw)			"

												From October to December I too was very enthusiastic about this game and I actually spent several months defending it from people calling it War Z 2.0 and not giving it an honest chance. (I just recently activated it on Steam) They were wrong at the time, but in the end they were right. The developers slowly stopped listening to the community and started locking threads that aimed to civilly discuss ethical choices made by the developers regarding the introduction of microtransactions in a non-cosmetic fashion. It started with backpacks and tactical grenades. Now things are a lot worse.Here are the things Nether Gold buys you:Camo outfits/team outfits: If you don't think blending in with your environment or being instantly identified by team members in close quarters team combat is purely cosmetic, you've been fooled.Flashlights and flares: Yeah, not really a big deal. But we're playing a survival RPG. The name of the game is loot loot loot. If you can pay for it with real money what's the point?Hang gliders: Some use these really well to sneak up on players/get out of tight situations from rooftops. Some people think it's a dead giveaway to your position and that using them is a bad idea. It doesn't really matter what you think. The fact of the matter is this item alters tactical gameplay for better or for worse. This is not a cosmetic item like they promised would be the only items available for purchase when I pre-ordered.Nether potions: Are you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off by that sniper who killed you? No worries, spawn in as a nether, run 60km/h to his spot, and take him out. Your team mates can now take his shiny military backpack, congrats!The king daddy of Nether P2W, Golden Keys: I don't think I need to explain this one, but I will. In a game where you literally do two things: Loot and kill things, (the success of killing things heavily depending on how well you loot) you can pay to do one of those things way, way better and easier? They're magical sacks that blind you from a block away, drop stacks upon stacks of MONEY, GUNS, AMMO, and MEDICAL SUPPLIES. Only if you happen to have paid the developers an extra fee of course. Disregard all of the other points. If you don't think Golden Keys -alone- are enough to qualify this game P2W, you're probably a delusional fanboy like I once was when I opened Nether on public beta day 1.These are just the problems that involve P2W. I could talk for days about how poorly the game has developed and how the developers are now abandoning ship with a last $2.99 cash grab, but that's not the point. "

												Everything was amazing until the hackers came. The first dev's did a patch that created more bugs and some wierd lag issues occured. Then the glitches and hacks started to appear. They never corrected it, rumors went around talking about bans but they never happened. They passed it onto another Dev's and they did a few patches. Nothing occured after that. More hackers started to appear after they knew nothing was going to happen to them. Then the 2nd Dev's passed it onto the third dev's. To my knowledge the 3rd dev's are the ones who created the Nether Arena, etc. The amount of servers are down to I think a hand full. And no one plays the game anymore. Hackers run the Nether world rather than looters and Nether monster. Would I recommend this game? Hell no, its been broken for awhile with many false promises. Was it fun while it lasted? Yes it was very fun. The good times hanging out with friends, hunting people that felt they wanted to mess with our crew was a blast. Our hearts would race, we would frantically talk on TS, it was good. Too bad it will never be at that state ever. Before it was 9/10, Today in 2015, its probably a .5/10.			"

												Although this is a pretty awesome game I must say a few things about it.. Pros:Nice graphicsAssassin-like feel to itAmazing mapCons: No PVEFew weaponsBad communityBefoe you judge my review, finish reading it. The game is awesome in forms of graphics and it makes you feel like you're creeping through the night with a huge map to explore.  There are numerous places to loot however this game is too hard. There are no servers with no PVE so you're forced onto PVP servers where people shoot on sight. I've yet to encounter someone who didnt kill me for nothing. You have a rough time finding a weapon and most of the time you just find parts to a weapon you must make yourself and then find bullets for the gun. Only one character I made has been able to properly loot without getting assassinated and starting from the beginning. You will probably die about 4 or 5 times before you find your first weapon and by then you will have people hunting you. You cannot put it on a server that isn't nearly full so not only do you have to deal with monsters/aliens you have to also deal with people who just kill you for fun. This is why I say it has a bad community but what pvp game doesn't? This game needs to let you create servers or at least play on less populated servers. As soon as this problem is fixed Maybe I'd recommend this game but when you reach a safe zone you are pretty much stuck there because another player will follow you until he can kill you for your knife... not recomended			"

												This game has a 52 on metacritic. This makes sense because it feels like half a game. The mission list is quite limited. You can:-Scavenge-Make deliveries-Join a tribe and capture territoriesAnd thats about it for missions.Other things you can do: -Use the global inventory to store your spare katanas so you can restart your game with a game breaker-Make guns-Hunt things and trade bits for xp, cash, and supplies, which can than use to survive longer, hunt more, get more things...-Buy junk from a shop that largerly breaks the game by making exceptionally powerfull melee weapons cheap. -Buy cosmetics from a shop-Kill other people-Explore the large, empty, incomplete landscapeThere are microtransactions, but it's not overwhelming, and you can pay with in game money as well, and money in the game is very easy to come across, so, of the many game breakers found within the game, actuall money is not one. There is no real story, and you don't feel like progress is being made no matter what you do. The upgrade system is adequate, although you never feel that much more powerfull.Despite this, the game is a fairly enjoyable experince thanks to it's atmosphere, and if you and a few friends play at a lan party or with group chat you can have a good time pretty easily. Shows promise.			"

												So far I've seen lots of zombie, monster, alien games. I have to say this one takes the prize for the worst. Seriously! The escorts leave you as a sitting duck, you can't equip any of your weapons. Also, the when the monsters *attack* you the noise is all the same FOR ALL THE MONSTER ATTACKS. It makes me laugh that the noise sounds like a smack. That's the only comfort I've actually gotten from this game. The crafting sucks(SERIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO RELY ON A NPC FOR CRAFTING AND YOU HAVE TO BE IN A SAFEZONE FOR THAT). The gameplay is... suspenseful because you NEVER know what's going to attack you a player? a monster? falling damage? Do not play this game it sucks... if you enjoy the sound of a smack then be my guest play this game.			"

												So i thought this game looked amazing, i bought it months ago, and look at the time i have in it. now im going to explain why this is bad.So i do not enjoy DayZ (or as i call it the Everlasting Beta) so this wont be me saying ""Dayz master rece feg""Anywho, this game in theory is fantastic, except for 2 things.1. Monsters - Ok. So monsters have the ability to teleport, and sense you pretty easily. Sounds realistic right? The only problem is you cannot hide from the Monsters, they always get to you. If you get caught by one as soon as you spawn, your either going to get hurt a ton, or die. Also just to add, there is a flying monster that is almost impossible to hit with a melee, so enjoy trying to hit it with a knife.2. ""Co-op"" - I use the term Co-op loosely. This is the only time that Dayz is good to me. In dayz, you can say friendly! and have a chance to meet a friend, although in Nether, they shoot instantly before you can speak. You cant meet new people, and helping people wont happen. If you go to drop a gun for a new spawn, they will either kill you with a knife (or attempt to) or take the gun and shoot you. Co-op isnt really a thing in this game.So all im saying is dont buy this unless they fix monsters, and your prepared to hide for 6 hours.			"

Making games is becoming a get rich quick scheme these days, it's very sad.Don't buy it, no server security, cheat prevention, and there is a host of bugs and game mechanics in need of fixing that make even the simplest task a chore.If nothing changes from now to the anniversary I'm going to file a complaint and get my money back.

												Game has come a long way since alpha. Still has some annoying bugs like certain keys not working. R wont reload and when I bind it to another key it still wont work. To reload I have to go into my inventory and unload my gun > go back in game > shoot my empty gun so it reloads. I have a Logitech G9x mouse and cannot assign my side buttons to anything. Have also ran into some movement and animation glitches. Game is fun and a lot better than it was when I first got it a few months ago, but some of these bugs seriously hamper game play. Considering how much pvp there is, the not being able to reload until my clip is empty is unacceptable because of all the killing on sight that occurs.			"

												Well, was interested on that title in a long while ago... purchased it also a long while ago... and finally took some minutes to play it. First of all, I'm stunned at how bad the visuals look in this game. It's almost close to PlayStation 2 era graphics and that's to be generous! The screenshots shown in the store page are misleading from the real deal!Gameplay-wise: You start with nothing besides a knife... slowly progress in the game by joining factions and the like. If you're lucky, you can team up with friends or other strangers in the 'net!I haven't played with other players as the servers are empty or full at the moment (limited selection of servers too).After reading a few other reviews, seems this game had lots of problems on launch and that the main developing team abandonned the game and another dev snatched it for a while, filled Nether with P2W & microtransactions (basically, screwing up the game to death). Seems original dev team came back with this ""Nether Resurrected"" edition but lately, game got ""abadonned"" yet again...So overall, not a good experience at all and I don't plan to play this again.Even on sale, I'd suggest you stay away from this game and fork that money into something more pleasant... like either another game or get yourself some beers!

												The game concept is good but the product is poorly done :( Don't let the screenshots fool you. I really recommend you to watch some Youtube videos first before you buy this game. The level design is really poorly done and I'm getting WarZ vibes from it.... For example floating assets, models that aren't solid and so on. Such a simple thing like this and not fixed even now shows us how unprofessional the devs are. The bugs in this game are the highlights: Monsters that on rare cases can one-hit kill you, the infamous server loading screen that overloads your pc and many other things. You can't even change your backpack since they didn't add it in game...every normal person would include this feature before they adding a backpacksystem. I don't really know what the devs are thinking. This game really reminds me of WarZ, the pick up system is quite similar, plus the lazy leveldesign and the safezones. But aside from that lol it can be quite fun, there are not so many hackers anymore since the VAC protection and I really like the monster models (but not the teleportation). Well, if you can ignore all the bugs and like to play team deathmatch on a big map with a little survival mechanism, then this is the game for you!  Let's hope this game won't have the same fate as WarZ lol! Thx for reading :)@Update: This game has been abandoned from the devs! Do not buy it!			"

												Although this is a pretty awesome game I must say a few things about it.. Pros:Nice graphicsAssassin-like feel to itAmazing mapCons: No PVEFew weaponsBad communityBefoe you judge my review, finish reading it. The game is awesome in forms of graphics and it makes you feel like you're creeping through the night with a huge map to explore.  There are numerous places to loot however this game is too hard. There are no servers with no PVE so you're forced onto PVP servers where people shoot on sight. I've yet to encounter someone who didnt kill me for nothing. You have a rough time finding a weapon and most of the time you just find parts to a weapon you must make yourself and then find bullets for the gun. Only one character I made has been able to properly loot without getting assassinated and starting from the beginning. You will probably die about 4 or 5 times before you find your first weapon and by then you will have people hunting you. You cannot put it on a server that isn't nearly full so not only do you have to deal with monsters/aliens you have to also deal with people who just kill you for fun. This is why I say it has a bad community but what pvp game doesn't? This game needs to let you create servers or at least play on less populated servers. As soon as this problem is fixed Maybe I'd recommend this game but when you reach a safe zone you are pretty much stuck there because another player will follow you until he can kill you for your knife... not recomended			"

												Back when this game was in alpha was amazing. The game would actually be a lot more interesteing than it is now. The game focuses only on PVP and nothing else. If you plan to play this game on your own or with 1-2 friends then don't bother with this game. You will need to be in a clan to actually survive. I will continue to play this game once they release PVE servers to make the game more enjoyable.Below is a video which shows how easy hacks are usable within the game.

All we have left is a stagnant, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game with pay-to-play, scavenging (that made the early gameplay fun) that was removed, and hackers running rampant spawing guns because no one wants to buy them.  This game is dead.  The game started off great but there was a transition in devs.  The new devs added pay to play, stopped developing the gameplay aspects of the game, and have payed no attention to the rampant hacking problem.  They either need to allow private servers with admin tools (which they probably cannot do with pay-to-play features) that will allow server admins to  manage their own hacking problems or star managing it themselves.  Given the complete lack of attention to the game in the last 6 months, the latter certainly won't be happening.			"

												finally i can make a honest review of this game after playing it for a year i willl be naming the good things about this game then the bad things about this game so lets jump right into it! nether is a game where you are in a city with monsters that will kill you on sight and many other dangers that lurk there. you start out in a 64 player server with only a butter knife and it is up to you to live and level up. there is a wide range of skills you can get by leveling up by killing nethers and bringing packages to the safezone they need to go to also watch out for other players because they might not be as nice as they say they are in this broken city you and your friends can band together or kill each other for loot and money that you find craft and kill for in your journeys.the game has a wide amount of weapons you can use to fight the nethers and the other players in these servers rangeing for rifles and pistols to skullaxes. as fun as this game sounds there is many downsides to this game that could have been great. to start off there is hackers running about everywhere so it is hard to live when you have speed hackers and people with aimbots that can shoot you from insane distance. secound there is no vac servers so there is no way to  stop these hackers even if you wanted to report them the site to even make a account for this game is down so for those planing on buying this game i am warning you not to but it so you can save your money for something else. 3 the games devs are all gone pretty much and the old team that left got replaced by nether LLC which this dev team is way over there head when it is coming to making this game and the dev team before this one had at least 1 or 2 updates a month. 4 the game has little monsters to fight anyway the most common thing you will run into is a person with a gun that will shoot you on sight as wel most of the time most of the community that was on nether has left there is only around maybe 500 left not even inculding that there is not many servers at most there maybe only 4 to 5 servers up at a time. now the only updates we get are pointless and fix the many problems we are having with the game hell some people cant even get on the game and there has still been no fix for it even after a year some people cant even link there accounts to steam and have not recived a refund for this game it awfull for those who have wasted there money and this game and have pretty much been scammed. so what i have to say about this game that could have been somthing that it gets a 3/10 for gameplay and a 1/10 for the services to the people who still cant even get there money back for this game.

												Honestly, when I bought this game in the beginning of Early Access it was a pretty solid game. It was a lot of fun, had a great atmoshere and of course it had some flaws, but they were bearable. Something I believe that really killed the game was issues that the developers failed to address, such as the infamous invulnerable crouch bug, the broken hit boxes that made melee combat nigh impossible. Even if they just said that they were working on the issues, it would would have been enough to make people hang on. But with their utter lack of transparency, people just become tired of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and quit.  When Phosphor Games ended up leaving development for the game to Pure FPS, I really hoped the'd make some positive changes, but I don't think there's been an update since about August of last year (2014). I really hoped that the new devs might be able to bring this game back to what it used to be, and if that becomes the case then I will gladly rejoin. But as of now, the game has been left to rot and fester in an incomplete and unfun state. Do not buy this game without reading the most recent reviews, as the current state it's in is a waste of money and time. 3/10			"

												Nether is a game with a great concept and lots of visual flair, but falls down hard on gameplay and content.The game still exists in what I would consider a pre-release/alpha state. The game works, you can play it, but it feels incomplete. There isn't a lot of content, there are plenty of glitches and hackers remain a problem. It seems like the devs have cashed out on this one and have neglected to finish the game.Ultimately, may be worth a few dollars on sale as there is some fun to be had, but essentially you're buying a game that will never be a complete experience.4/10EDIT 1 Nov. 2015 The original development team is back, and seem to be addressing some of the issues that have held Nether back. It's still not a recommend from me, but there's hope that Nether might become the game it has the potential to be!			"

												I enjoyed the scale, the environments, the small details, and realism but didn't care for the enemies. Teleporting zombie alien creatures really don't fit in the game although they are quite terrifying because if you agro more than one your chances of survival are small. Sneaking around them proved almost impossible. Sneaking didn't do much good. The fact that you lose everything that isn't banked is a huge incentive for being cautious but costs a lot of what could be fun risk taking gameplay because as you progress further you become more and more reluctant to venture farther. It puts a real damper on exploration for long periods of time and adds a lot of monotonous walking. The idea of this game sold me before I played it but after a several hours of grind that kept being wiped out by a random PvP encounter I uninstalled the game and never looked back. BORING. I deeply regret this purchase.			"

												I like this game. I mean, I WANTED to like this game. I really did.*Damn Vet's with squeaky voices keep sniping you at safezones (which every few hours are not actually safe) and weapons drop points.*Tribes was supposed to encourage team-play. So far, not so much.*Perma-Crappy-Death. I like the idea of that, but I don't actually like it, at least not here, not in this implementation of a game.*Nether that can be outrun - if you sacrifice everything and end up out in the open... snipe. gg.*I love the idea of a more 3D world than Day-Z (by that, I mean it's got more vertical elements to it - high buildings).*I've had this game for a long time. They changed some stuff in a a recent update. Turns out it's pay-to-win now.*Screenshots of well equipped teams working together.... I only ever saw that once, on my 1st day in the game. Wish I'd made better friends with them. *Basically, too damn brutal and unforgiving. Made so by the hole-breathers that crapshoot newer players.*They need a PvE (Player VS Environment) server. Basically make it impossible to shoot each other. ===>>>On PvEIt's what the community keeps screaming for. Just one. Then tell all their players about it - especially us, the disappointed leavers. It will fill up, 1st day. They will go ""Oh crap this is popular"" and it will be 90% PvE Servers within a week. Either that, or they will keep Their current vision alive until it dies this time next year from lack of funding... Because the ""Community"" (mostly 13yo♥♥♥♥♥♥♥beaters) will keep killing off the newbs that would keep coming back - the newbs with the money. Don't believe me? Look at the community. Most of the actives have a max of 10 games on their accounts, 4 of those being CoD. Go figure. The people writing these reviews are the ones that have 100-400 games on our accounts. Where do you suppose the money is? Why, it's leaving to find a game with PvE servers, of course.If you want the full gripe-sheet, just keep reading the other comments. I can't say anything that hasn't been said plenty of times already. Keep reading. Sadly, Thumbs down from me. I wanted to like this game. "

												My first impression on the early access was frustrating, i had only one chance of trying this game because it didn't support my computer.Now you're asking. What is so relevant to this new review i'm writing? Well dear costumers, i feel cheated and fooled.They have not fixed the issue, i've burned money for nothing and sadly enough, this is the only game that doesn't work on my library, isn't that fun?I guess i'm to fault to have bought this game but they didn't warn me at that time. it's unfinished and the developers rushed it out of Early access prior tosummersales just to get an extra penny, that's the impression i'm getting.I do not recomend this game untill they fix all of the obvious things mentioned earlier.

Early Access Review
								I don't like the direction that the game is going.  I thought it was better before tribes were so poorly implemented.  They keep adding items to loot, collect and craft with but never increase how much you can actually carry nor store.'Safe' zones turn into deathtraps with no warning, game breaking clipping issues, AI that is such a joke that I often wonder how anyone dies to them, vehicles that are completely undrivable.  Like... who did they get to program the vehicle controls?  A blind lemur?  Seriously... worst ever.  And I've played a lot of games.It was more fun when it was simple, but now they add tribes.  You now either have a blindingly huge nametag right on peoples faces.... completely destroying immersion, but at range you have no way of telling who is in your tribe and then you're punished for killing them.This game, duing beta, started out as a solid 6.5 but had 'progressed' to a 4.

												This game is worth it for what it is and does, and worth it when on sale for what it can potentially be as well.Let me describe what the game will be like using a few examples of key moments everyone who plays the game will eventially experience.1. They spawn in, and have no idea what they will be doing, with some sort of tutorial at start involving packages (What are these? Do they play a big role?). You get a basic weapon (Can gun) and after that are left to fend for yourself.2. You join your first tribe! What is this? Is this like a clan? Do you have friends now automatically that will help you? (You don't, it is shoot first ask questions later, regardless of what ""Tribe"" you may both be in. You can switch tribes once a day.)3. You look for other players to group up with, you realize going it alone is dangerous, you might have already had to run from nether, or died from them.4. Your new friend probably killed you, or a more experienced player did. You learn to store your VALUABLE stuff (Gun parts and such) in the global inventory for until when you can make your own gun!5. You got your first player kill! Look at all that stuff they had (or sometimes, don't have anything), but it feels like a rush, you are no longer the harmless victim!6. You die AGAIN, well, apparently you are.7. You make some ACTUAL friends and you go on teamspeak with them and go out into the city or wasteland together to either loot, or go hunt other players, your getting the hang of it now!8. You have actually built up a relatively decent stockpile of weapons and suck in your Global Inventory for when you eventually die, so you don't have to start from scratch.9. You now have guns, ammo, food, and medical supplies, you want for nothing but you still feel the drive to gather more loot, more of the GOOD guns, you and your friends actually can start to hold your own...10. You die AGAIN, either from flying into a building when gliding and falling to your death, or friendly fire, or someone with the Cru on a rooftop, but you die, and realize no matter how long you play, your never invincible, your never safe, you never win, just do a little better each time.

												I can only say that I was one of the people who bought this game at its full price only some time after it came out because I thought I saw potential. However, after this game had been ruined in the development process, I knew my hopes of a good, or at least decent game, had been dashed.In its current state, which it is likely to remain in, I would have to slap a big NO on Nether for whoever wants to buy it.

												Hey you, yes you. Do you like being shot to death 2 mins after you leave the safe zone by other friendly players? Do you like not free to play, pay to win MMO'ish games (that can only seem to support a fairly low number of players per server) where you can buy fake currency with real currency to buy life saving items like melee weapons, health water, gliders, backpacks,  clothes and character emotes (like dancing, gesturing etc)? Do you like droppimg those things on death for assumedly any one to raid (you get to keep your clothes if you are wearing them and I assume the gestures)? Do you like losing all your levels and recreating your character everytime you die? Do you like delivering boxes through empty desolate (but also very pretty - the graphics in this game are nice) landscapes? Do you like a total lack of worthwhile NPC dialogues or character from you NPC's?  Do you like a minimal variety in your monsters?  Do you like not being over inundated with too many servers to choose from (not many left).  Weird glitches when ever you go through water (being able to live under water, having watery distortion follow me while on land)? Then this is the game for you, otherwise take the above in to consideration.It's not that Nether is actually bad as such it's just the over combination of factors can leave a bitter taste in a new players mouth.The landscape looks breathtaking when you first log on to it (although it is difficult at first to determin what you can interact with and at what angle you need to be on in order to get the vehicle or whatever to give you the option to do so) though variation is a lacking.The people all look a little like characterless mannequins (players and NPC's alike) however what few monster desgns there is do look good on close inspection if a little derivative. The monster noises are also quite good if repetitive. From the trailer and from playing the game  it seems to want to deliver what we love from the Last of us (minus the scripted parts), Borderlands series (minimal RPG elements), DayZ (survival with teleporting fleshy monsters things instead of zombies) and Minecraft (the reliance on item crafting).It makes for an interesting soup of ideas that sort of works but at the same time sort of feels like it misses the mark.If you have a crew of players I'm sure you can get more out of this, though I suspect  that most of the fun will be had fighting against other groups of players for dominance of the map (though it has to be said that there are a host of other games that can offer this same experience or better).If you want to try this solo, this game may try your patience.

Early Access Review
								hey everyone,  like many of you (possibly) i was on the fence about purchasing a survival genre game. i had heard many things about many other games (Dayz,Rust,The Dead Linger) and so i did some research ( as one would normally do before purchasing a game they are not sure about). I had gone through many google searched and stumbled across the site for this game. I had looked at it before but was unsure if i wanted to purchase a game that wasn't out yet. well a few months later i foudn the site again and saw it was out. Still, i was unsure. then i read a review on Steam about how the game is ""as bad♥♥♥♥♥as you want it to be"", so i decided to take the plunge. I must say i have been falling ever since ( thats a good thing ).ok now that i have said that lets get to the pros and cons.Pros=======1. I am enjoying the visuals quite nicely2. It isn't an MMO style game with thousands of players gunning at you ( i think 64-65 people is max on a server ATM)3. When you die you lose everything you have gathered and all levels and experience.4. looks like there is alot of feedback from the community and developers.5. so far the world is fairly contained, a bit small but still takes a while to get places making the world seem much bigger.Cons=======1. (this is my biggest gripe) often times it seems that the hotkeys will not work (I.E when i hold E to take an item it will not show up as if i am even holding the button down, or when i hit enter to chat the chat window will not pop up.2. see number 2 above.3. see number 3 above.4. Community (?) supposedly people have been running into alot of jack a ninnies.. in my experience with the game( granted its quite short ATM) i have come across 1 person who has actually killed me while looting.( and i did happen to kill a person, but in my defense i had seen that he had killed like 3 people already and was a bit paranoid) and in my last game lastnight someone was camping a safe zone and sniping people as they left.5. as i said above the map is small but it feels quite large. it seems to me that safezones are pretty far from each other. ( as this is a survival game i understand this is kind of preferred and i can adapt. its just a personal preference of mine. i would prefer them a tiny bit closer so i could complete missions a bit easier.) to expand upon: 4 times last night i had courier packages for different safe zones and was never able to complete said missions due to nethers. ( as i said it is survival, i understand this, and will adapt.)6. Text chat is only Global, Proximity is Voice. ( i would like some type of proximity text chat at some point, but not a big CON)7. (added due to talking about the game with a friend and realized this) as of this moment Grouping is not available but there are plans to implement grouping soon ( my undertsanding is they might be implementing a tes version in the next update) but with all said and done. i enjoy the game very much and several times i have felt the tension and pulse racing of fearing for my life ESPECIALLY at night when it goes damn near pitch black.9/10 for me anyways.sidenote: oh if you have been hearing about a problem with resolution sizes and such. there is a good guide to fix this. also for a safer method read the comments with the guide ( i believe it starts with ""you should NEVER"" ) well TY for reading and hope to see you soon ( either through a scope/iron sights or in a friendly manner)Tip: also if you ARE using steam to play Nether i suggest you try to add friends from the game or RL to your friends list in order to communicate with them so as not to give away position through Global chat ( which is the only Taxt chat in the game)			"

												I am no stranger to PvP games. I've never been one to enjoy or understand the enjoyment of killing people you have nothing to gain from. I've played plenty of DayZ and Rust and these games wouldn't be the same without PvP in my opinion. But those two games seem to do something that Nether has never done for me. Give me hope. Both of those games are full of dread, am I going to survive my trip to loot things, is someone going to bring a backpack full of C4 and blow my doors in and take everything I've worked so hard to collect? But they offer the chance, that slight beautiful chance that you could possibly survive and thrive in this dark, and terrible place. You do find friends sometimes, who give you a bite to eat when you thought you would die of starvation so you might make it another day. There is none of this in Nether. Nether never offers a ray of hope even for a moment. It is simple devestation, from the game play, to the game's programming. You'll die before you get anything worthwhile, probably 10 times over. And then when you find that shiney new rifle and you think now you'll be able to live a little longer you fall through the road, or get stuck in some random spot that doesn't make any sense at all.

												I saw Markiplier play this game and thought I would try it. All in all I am HIGHLY disappointed with this game. It had a ton going for it but you're told nothing and expected to know everything and survive. Let me start with the Game itself, You're essentially a courrier that is tasked to take packages from Point A to Point B and earn rewards for doing so. Keep in mind, when you first start off, you're only armed with a butcher's knife so if you die you'll be stuck with that as your only weapon. I have no problem with this except for with the fact that the main safe zone is occasionally attacked and vulnerable to monsters who can then spawn in the zone. If this happens you have to fix the Anti Nether machines in the zone to restore it.""What's that? You want to know what the machine looks like?"" The game says as you're suddenly surrounded with only a knife by enemies that will kill you in 4 hits ""♥♥♥♥ if I know, figure it out yourself"" is the last thing the game says before you die and you lose all your collected items. So you're essentially in a situation where you're constantly outmatched against enemies when you first start out.Unless the Devs decide to overhaul everything then I would stay away from this game unless you enjoy getting screwed over constantly or just like an insane challenge.

												The game is finally being taken care of. Right now its down and only open to singleplayer gameplay from players who already have it (I think). This game is very awesome. Love the AI, the graphics, weapons, etc. But the devs renamed it and are trying to get multiplayer up, and when they do it will be released to the public for some more old fashion fun again.			"

Nether is a post-apocalyptic survival game that has you facing both other humans and mutants alike. It's a great concept and it works for most of the part, but there's one thing that completely kills the experience.The Pros:· A fun crafting system that'll allow you to craft weapons from weaponparts you've collected.· The Nether mutants look disgustingly good, which gives them an additional sense of threat.· Knowing that both other players and Nether mutants could constantly be watching you will keep you alert and immersed. Nether mutants will teleport behind you and challenge your skills in combat, whereas other players can gun you down at any given second (except when you're in a Safe Zone). I found that this shift of threats kept me adjusting and finding new tactics.The Cons:· The open world is linear and rather dull. The detail of overgrowing vegetation and crumbling buildings is gorgeous, but there's so little loot that there's no real purpose to search for it. Just kill some Nether mutants and sell their spines and blood to buy things you need, or kill other players and make good use of what they dropped. Dozens of old stores and abandoned cars, but rarely is there any loot nearby. The world is like a delicious cake, but it's filling is pure mud. Everything feels like a useless prop rather than being part of the world.· The community kills the game... literally and figuratively. If you spawn, you have the option to spawn in a Safe Haven or just in the world. If you choose a Safe Haven, chances are you won't be able to leave it. Other players are constantly covering the exits and entrances of Safe Havens, leaving everyone who comes out look like a sitting duck. Plus, nine out of ten times, the loot dropped by killed players won't even be picked up. If someone's running over to grab it, he too gets shot, and so on. This literally wastes a ton of what the game has to offer. The objectives will have you delivering packages in a Safe Haven, but it's pure suicide.The Visuals:· Gorgeous lighting, stunning detail and disgusting Nether mutants. Nether is a visual beauty.Final Verdict:· Nether could be one of the top survival MMO games currently out there, but its community and poor delevoping choices make it merely a dumbed-down shell of what it could have been. Fun is to be had though, as long as you're on the good side of the gun barrel. 6.5/10			"

								If Your going to buy this game, be ready to have a heart rate of 100,000! Playing on a crowded server can be very dangerous. Though it is hard to say wihch is a bigger threat, the Teleportang-sound-attracted-Nether, or The Humans Killing the Teleporting-sound-attracted-Nether. The first time I was ever killed by another player, I had already teamed up with another player, and we were going for a loot drop zone (which was suicidal but we were a bit greedy at the time). When we arrived I spotted someone and we hid for almost 20 minutes. Then we went out into the fog, which we crouched in for no more than 2 seconds, when suddenly, out of no where, my friend in front of me is shot and killed. Somewhere out there was a man with a Sniper, I had no idea where though! So I ran for cover and went prone only to have bullets shot inches in front of my face, I could even see dust fly up where the bullets had gone into the dirt. Sadly, I panicked ( HEART RATE 100,00!!!) I got up and RAN! But was shot and killed.TIPS!!!:Remain alert!!! Shoot first, ask questions later! More fun with friends. Listening skills are key! as is vision. It helps to wear headphones for ""surround sound"". Make Friends when possible!. STEALTH!!! This is a GREAT game, I can't wait to see it released complete. I have a feeling that this game will bring honorable memories in the near future.			"

												Lets cut to the chase here, I read so many reviews from people who either a) Haven't played the gameb) Played it and seen approximately 5% of the contentc) Have played it with a opinion already made up before first impressions.Note: I do like the attention Nether is receiving and think it is great people are contributing to the community wether it's miscronstrude or otherwise.So I have decided to drop my own review to give people a neutral view on the title.From the get-go yes, it DOES have a lot of bugs. This can not be denied on any level. Many of these bugs will irritate you and sometimes hamper a game experience for a fair amount. But what you have to realise is this game IS NOT a finished product. It's released as a premium game (no longer alpha/beta on steam) because if i recall (95% sure) due to legal / development restrictions, and changes the devs wished to make in the near future.~~ Pro's: ~~One of the only survival games on the market I know which still becomes a challenge when in a group of 3-5 players. This is a very rare achievement of any survival game. Take a second to think of the titles you know, and i'll bet there will only be maybe 1/2 others.Open world but not to the point you spend 3-4 hours grouping up with your friends. You can pretty much enjoy the experience from the word go. (Has a map system etc for quick location)Currently the game is receiving a lot of attention from the devs (i.e. VAC support, Map extention - twice its original size, playable Nethers, Tribe system, Territory control, Tribe reputation system and A Crafting system All added I believe within a year)  -  forgive me if my timeframe is a touch out.RPG elements. You have a character level, and an account level. as you go through your time in the game performing certain tasks or doing particular actions will award you with EXP (also selling items) this EXP will go towards your account level and character level. Long story short, if you die your character level goes back to 0 (max 31) but your account level will remain. Now at first it seems ""oh right if you have max account level I have no hope of survival"" however this is not the case, the bonuses are noticable but not game changing. Which surprises me greatly as having this system and trying to keep an equilibrium of balance amount new and old players, isn't an easy task.Freedom to play how you like. Now for me this is a must have for any Survival game or multiplayer game, to let the players dictate their own style of how THEY want to play the game. If you want to sneak around the wasteland and hunt players? particular tribes? wage a war? that's your call. Or wether you want to try help people or just amass a crazy amount of firepower? play it pretty much strictly PVE. Go ahead.~~ Cons: ~~As previously mentioned, yes it is buggy. The vehicles added (now I believe only available from one location) are pretty much unplayable and I have to say now I never see feature (driven around) which is a shame, but I can bet my bottom dollar this will change.Hacking, this can become an issue, but hell. It's an onlineFPS game. with 10years of Counter-strike behind me through its many stages and with what you have played, this will always be an issue (since the VAC update, the amount of hackers I see is very few thankfully)In game currency. Now this is a really touchy topic, in game currency does not hinder my experience in any way. I only put it down as a con because quite simply, I dont agree with it as I am sure many others also do not approve. But it is strictly put in place for cosmetic things (i.e. some outfits, masks etc.) in no way does it give me an advantage over the next average Joe in the Wasteland. (also to note I would say 80% of whats buyable via the in game currency, is also available via the free in game money system) That pretty much sums up the most important things i'd say you may need to know. To summarise for those who want to play an FPS survival game, very atmospheric, and doesn't lose substance despite playing as solo or in a group, which is easy pick up and play with a nice implementation of RPG elements. Then I recommend you give it a shot.But as before, if you buy this title expecting an already done finished and polished product, then you've come here to early. Otherwise I look forward to seeing you in the wasteland :)			"

								My friend and I were doing great at this game; we had plenty of food and weapons. Basically enough to survive. One day while adventuring the city, me and my friend were attacked by a group of people. They held my friend hostage and told me if I don't give them all my stuff, they would kill him. Naturally, I did. But like the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥they were, they shot him and I took off running. I didn't give them my pistol because they didn't know I had it. I opened fire on them. They shot back and hit me, I was down to 70 HP. My friend was dead and his captors had all our stuff. Eventually, one of them caught me. He and I looked eyeballs. He looked right into my face, and as I looked into his. I almost for a second thought he'd let me go. But then, right then, he shot me right in between the eyes and stole my pistol. Long story short, don't trust anybody and be careful when walking the streets. 10/10 best Horror Survival MMO I've ever played.			"

								What an addictive game. You'll span in not knowing what to do. Then you run into your first zombie. Its most likely to be a crawler, you'll kill him and lose a big cunk of healt too. Now you go to a safezone and see the shiny boxs 'deliver to LSZ for cash', you probaly wont deliver the first one but eventually you will get one dellivered and invest in a better blade. Now your hooked, you want more. Just remeber everyone wants you dead. P.S. Remember to scavenge for things and don't get the beackon unless you're ready for that death trap and you can chat with other people by hitting enter.			"

								Nether is a great game, with its soft post apocalyptic city ambience makes your body calm, calm enough that if any enemy pounces you at any time, it'll make you jump out of your chair and♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself. The game is still in BETA, but the map is already very expansive and amazing, even though it's half of what it will be when the game finishes its BETA phase. Nether has a wide variety of weaponry, food stuffs, character equipment such as masks and hats, and enemies that'll keep the player engaged and immersed within the game. This game is extremely entertaining and fun, I recommend playing with friends though, or you'll just die really easily XD.			"

												Nether is a casual gamer's worst nightmare. Once you die, you lose everything, levels, items, etc. If you can manage to survive the other players, creatures from hell, and your food and water requirements, then you may just like the game. There are factions in this game also, excpet betrayal of faction members is still completly possible. Even the safezones are not always safe, so dont idle for too long...			"

								To be honest, I'm not entirely sure how I feel.On one hand, it's exactly as promised. An open, large, urban landscape with items to scavenge for and monsters to be wary of. And not to mention, other players to watch out for.And on the other hand, the other players are absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Unlike DayZ, the people who play Nether tend to be more childish and instead of Bartering deals and murdering only for the sake of safety, they kill to just kill anything they see. It becomes harder for new players or new characters to get settled into things. Another issue is the looting. The items are not found in drawers, beneath tables or any sort of hiding spots. They're floating above ground and illuminated by God's light. Now, yes that makes it easier to find, but that then means they have designated spawn points rather than truly being scavenged items.All in all, rather than a survival MMO, this basicaly has the feel of a large world Unreal Tournament death match game. You run, pick up items, find money, buy weapons, and kill other players. You do this for the entirety of the game with lack of true Survivalism.Either I only had this experience because I've played mostly by myself, or this truly is how the game is run.Disappointing, 4/10.

												This is an aweful game. Nothing works, absolutely nothing. First issue: When you first start up the game and get to the server list it freezes for a good 5 minutes + Second: When you spawn in for the first time you just spawn as an observing, floating camera, with no prompt as of what to hit to get to a menu, and no it's not the usual 'ESC', I had to hold the enter key. Third: All that starting cashing you're supposed to have and other items when you get the chosen package isn't in your inventory, you start off with a kitchen knife and no direction, no tutorial, nothing. I can't even see how this is considered a product. This is♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's not even Alpha stage, it's like a bunch amteurs got into an Arma map builder and made something in an afternoon after heavey morning drinking. I'm happy I got it on sale so I don't feel too screwed. Steam shouldn't allow these morons to sell anything and the game needs to be removed from the Steam store until they have something that is actually working and an actual game. This is pathetic.			"

												Terrible game. Spend hours running around ok looking map, fighting with clunky mechanics against cool enemies, most of which you need to run away from until you get a gun of some sort. Fighting mechanics are so clunky, guy runs up on me with a katana, swinging wildly, I block and run away... Die about ten seconds later, with this guy 15 feet away. Game either lags or mechanics are so crappy that it scores the hit on his end because HE lags but his machine counts a hit.Also, ""NEW UPDATE"" usually doesn't mean that they have terrible menu bugs that make you wait on a laggy server list to populate before even getting to select one to play.In summary: good idea, poor execution, poor mechanics, poor, poor, poor.

								Okay so heres my review after reading some of the reviews.i agree on some opinions such as name tag shouldn't appear unless close as that would give away positions but some of the opinions i just disagree with. i can understand why you feel the way you do but people who say leveling isn't worth anything is wrong in a way as leveling in a game like this makes it much more fun and gives just a little something extra as what you could call a prize or gift for surviving that long while fighting your way through those levels to survive. also the safe zones being camped isn't that bad, well as far as i've played but i haven't played since december due to it being early access and i want a proper and full game experience when it fully releases but me and my brother always snuck away from safe zones without any trouble. There are many ways in and out of a safe zone and any route could be taken, althought some safe zones are limited to 2 entrance/exits such as the camp in the north. thats what sprinting away really fast is for and also you must make sure you are aware of your surroundings and not just running into a bunch of nether creatures haha xD imo most of the stuff such as pvp, trying to sneak away from safe zones etc is what makes this game intense and adds to the environment and fun of the game. leveling just adds to the tension as it makes you not want to die so you can keep all the perks but it only helps a bit and doesn't make you invincible. you need to try and enjoy the game without triyng to take out all the fun, try and get someone to play with. it's even better when you get a full inventory full of stuff you just found and ending up in a gun fight in the middle of no where with another group of survivors LOL. everyone wants to survive and tensions are high which makes people trust others less as they are scared of dying and losing their levels and equipment. But when me and my brother played, it didn't have the group system or the other updates which i've seen in the updates, but there still was a negative to killing just anyone as if you killed a lot of people, you would end up attracting a ton of nether which would just literally tear you apart no matter how geared up you are. unless of course u had lots of stamina and one of those nether bombs to throw in a different direction or one of those machines that make nether creatures flee for a little while. Really they should add more stuff like a roaming boss as i don't currently like that reaper thing that sits in the middle of no where in a random park in the north. they should have a large slow roaming creature which would add so much tension and excitment into the game. and it could also create a small area of fog around it so it cannot be seen very well from a distance. oh how that would be amazing! and also it could grant a decent peice of equipment or something for the people who helped slay the beast but ofc that shouldn't be easy. so much things could make this game better.I have nothing against other peoples opinions as this is just my own opinion of some and i respect your opinions. But i find this to be an excellent game which could be so so much betterBut anyway this game is really not friendly to those who honestly play alone. you should definitely grab a friend or someone trust worthy to play with and atleast have voice communication with. When getting into game, you should always expect some sort of pvp encounter unless you are lucky to avoid such things but they are always quite fun if it ends up as a group war, Item spawning is terrible as some have said, needing food and health and not getting any while still loosing it in a safe zone is just rediculous but then again force you to go out and look for items to survive on. there should be something such as go out and kill some nether and depending on how much nether you kill, you get a reward for going back into a safezone or even just going back into the main safe zone as there is a large shortage of supplies for people just getting into the game. maybe even some supplies for a first time visit into the main safe zone just to help someone who has nothing, but won't give to those who have obviously stored food and health supplies into their bank.There can be so much going for this game yet. maybe in the future this game would show its true colours and what it can do and hopfully a great game like this doesn't go to waste.

Early Access Review
								So far, in it's current build this is a truly horrible game, it fails on many levels. First, it took over three days for Nether's secondary account system to sync with Steam's account system (this is also a complaint against Steam, as the reason I use this service is a single sign-in, which isn't, if every game also has it's own sign-in). Also the servers being up is hit and miss and the error message given is ""connection failed"" which doesn't help much with trouble shooting. Also the game is rife with bugs. Frequently you cannot pick up items that are on open ground in front of you. If it is on a shelf of some type, you cannot pick them up at all. Monsters will sense you through walls and will also move through walls to reach you. Certain creatures have a ""teleport"" ability, which they will use to spawn on top of and immediately hit you (no on-screen indication until you are hit). Then there is the resource balance aspect, which is also disappointing. You will need to search on average about 15 large sized buildings to hope you find an item of value. Food is the most prevalent, but currently has little to no use (it doesn't heal you, it can restore stamina). Next most common is a melee weapon, but you have  a weight limit, and it is not suggested to carry more than one. Third most common is a firearm, which is good, but usually only comes with whatever rounds were already loaded. Things that rarely spawn include ammunition, water, bandages. Also the creatures never drop weapons or food, but players do. With as few resources are in the game, and the fact that the creatures are not a source of potential resources, you should kill players. They have a chance to have food/weapons. Overall this game was not ready for even beta status, and was not worth the 11.99 that was paid for it. Recommendation: Do not buy.			"

I tried forever trying to figure out what account is linked to my steam, but they don't even have a redeem account. I can't even play it, spent money on it just to be suckered by some undeveloped game. DO NOT BUY!			"

												I bought Nether on sale after reading some positive reviews that compared it to other multiplayer survival games. The installation and creation of an account was fast & easy.  At the time i played ingame menu and server list tended to lagg heavily. There was no tutorial or intro whatsoever. I did not really mind the couple bugs i encountered like being stuck in corners or objects along with sudden disconnection. What really made playing this game a horrible experience is the amount of hackers on the servers matched with the heavy pvp orientation of most of the community if you want to call it one. Right now you are running around scavenging or solving tasks for an hour after having waited for a group to gather for usually twice the time just to end up loosing everything again due to an ambush, hackers or the lowest creep that might simply one-hit you out of nowhere. So right now this game is wasted time. Glad i bought it really cheap!  "

												I can't give this a very shining reccomendation in its current state; the world is dreary and there's few activities to participate in other than packing cardboard boxes around or ambushing strangers for laughs. Enemy hit-boxes are misleading for melee attacks and guns appear to send bullets flying at odd angles to the direction of the barrel, at though the bullets all have ADHD or something. Trailers and hype seem to encourage players to spend most of their time killing eachother for energy drinks and bullets, but I didn't seem to have exceptional trouble staying supplied. While unfinished, it may be a better game in the future, but for now Nether probably isn't going to turn a whole lot of heads. Unless you spend virtually all your spare time playing Left 4 Dead clones and the STALKER games, wait for a finished release.			"

												Don't waste your hard earned money on this game.This game is basically a huge pile of crap  . The map is really small and half of it is a ♥♥♥♥ing wasteland . Loot ? Yeah , good luck finding any , and if you do , other players will just kill you and you will lose everything , from items to EXP and Levels .Everything in this game is basically terrible .PvE is non-existent , boss fights are boring as f*ck . All the quests are the same - Deliver the box to a safezone . There is nothing you can do other than find loot which are you rarely find and if you do , you will most likely find something useless . Oh but you can get into buildings and find stuff . NOPE , there are like 5 buildings and they are all the same .Oh and did I mention it is Pay2Win ? With a recent update , almost every single item is expensive as ♥♥♥♥ to buy with in-game money . Even the main menu is awful for god's sake .So , in conclusion,Pay2Win -  ✔Non-existent PvE - ✔Random people killing you -  ✔Boring map - ✔Lose everything when you die - ✔Terrible customization - ✔Ugly HUD - ✔Special features? - LOL NOStoryline - HELL NODo yourself a favor and don't waste money on this game.

												What you're shown: Intruiging storyline, challenging combat, survival on limited supplies, open-world co-op/pvp to add an element of danger.What you get: Hackers, cheats, glitchy monsters, buggy & unreliable loot drops, limited/linear means of progression (if it can be called that), excessivly punishing death/respawn system and a ""global inventory"" that leaves little to no room to store those important items and novelty loot or even a means of expanding said inventory.A real dissapointment, I am ashamed that I even bothered picking this up. Something that I would say about only three other games!Seriously, you'd be better off getting Team Fortress, at least it's free.			"

After 20 minutes of wasted time on account management, we're stuck on main menu screen waiting at least 5 minutes for servers to refresh >.< (doing anything during that time may cause the game to crash, just go make some tea or smth).

												Terrible game. Spend hours running around ok looking map, fighting with clunky mechanics against cool enemies, most of which you need to run away from until you get a gun of some sort. Fighting mechanics are so clunky, guy runs up on me with a katana, swinging wildly, I block and run away... Die about ten seconds later, with this guy 15 feet away. Game either lags or mechanics are so crappy that it scores the hit on his end because HE lags but his machine counts a hit.Also, ""NEW UPDATE"" usually doesn't mean that they have terrible menu bugs that make you wait on a laggy server list to populate before even getting to select one to play.In summary: good idea, poor execution, poor mechanics, poor, poor, poor.

												Wandered around for about 20 minutes, found some stale doritos and ate them immediately.  As I munched, I heard a thunderous roar outside of the gas station where I sought refuge.  A man was being beaten to death by a hulking purple monster. ""Should I help him?"" I wondered to myself.  But, I was too late already, the man was demolished in mere seconds, and the beast walked away.  I looted his bag he left on the ground and found myself some nether skulls.  Traded them for a pistol at the local cult store and went on a hunting spree.  After killing about 6 nether creatures, i took pause to eat an energy bar.  Bullets rained down from above me.  next thing I knew, I was down to only a quarter of my health.  I saw my attacker, but I only had 1 bullet left.  I snuck through the bushes to get a better shot and BAM!... I missed!  He however saw where I shot at him from and returned fire, clipping me as I ran.  He chased me down several city blocks, that is until I finally lost him.  My luck then turned and I found a medkit and some bandages along with more food.  I stopped off in a nice little apartment building and observed the sun setting outside.  *STOMP STOMP CRASSSSHHH!!!*  A hulking nether appeared behind me, and I ran down the stairs as fast as I could.  I could see the safe zone just down the road!  and who should show up but the man who had shot me before.  A swift dose of lead to my skull cap ended me right then and there.  I guess no matter how many times you cheat death, It catches us all in the end.  Overall point: Nether can be and is a great game.  I bought it for $2.99 and love it.  May not be worth $15 however.

												I have played this game sense The Alpha days, and i really thought this was a great survival game! This was my very first survival type game that i have ever played. This Game has a few things  going for it. such as the super cool monsters that actually are a threat. unlike dayz the monsters are a major threat in this game. without some decent gear you are going to get destroyed.  The beautiful graphics makes the city feel like it was at one time a very lively city.  unfortunalty thats really all thats good about this game. There is a wasteland in the game which seems really cool, unfortunalty it really isn't. There is barely any loot and its just a waste of time going there. It's a shoot on sight type of  game. There aren't any friendly people in the game. The combat gets very repetitive very quick. With Melee weapons sometimes it feels like you are slicing through air. Over all I can only recomend this to people who are getting into the survival genre. For people who have played this genre for a long while STAY AWAY from this game its not worth your time.			"

												       Neather, a game that requires more updates then Team Fortress 2, but lacks the fun that any game provides us with. This should be classified as a running simulator because all you do is run around an empty map, into empty buildings, and empty safezones. Nothing happens in this game. There is no other way to rate this game unless you classify it as a Running Simulator because that's all you do. Run. If you enjoy running around a destroyed map then buy this game as that is all you will do!			"

												WOW! They released the ""final version"" of this game? I honestly thought this still had about a year before the final , at LEAST 6 months before entering into BETA let alone releasing this half, no, quarter finished game from Alpha. Guess they figured it'd be an easy way to get a cash infusion by saying it's officially released since most of the early player base is gone due to the massive amount of open hacking and lack of generally anything to do. Seems mainly like a moneygrab while they can. I'd like to note this review wouldn't be so scathing if they had actually kept it in alpha and finished the game.During the beta, they put in this GIANT map alluding to the final version having a large map. Nope, they took a city block, stretched it out over a huge empty ""wasteland"" and had a handy excuse to not put jack in while saying they expanded the map. I'd like to say I was exagerrating about this but it's pretty literal.Here's a rundown of the features:EXPLORE Run around through the same buildings for block after block until you remember which ones actually have anything in them. Then farm loot spots/get killed by a hacker while trying.TRIBES AND TERRITORY WARS Do you like sitting in an empty building for fifteen minutes at a time to capture some arbitrary landmark with no real bonuses for your time? This is the feature for youPLAYER AND GROUP MISSIONS I suppose if you actually found someone not hacking or killing you on site traveling in the same general direction, you could consider the ""missions"" as group. Here's an all inclusive list of the myriad of missions available for completion!-Repeat the same fetch quest over and over and over again carrying a brown box from one safe zone to another! Sometimes to DIFFERENT safe zones!-Group up (wait that doesn't actually happen) to take down the nether surge! What's a nether surge you ask? Why, a group of nether out in the world trying to kill you. Is it a larger or more difficult group or really any different than the regular creatures that would spawn there? If you count a marker being added to your map that may or may not be near the creatures, it's different!- Kill a reaper for some reason! For only a short fifteen minute run from where you probably are, you can waste a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of ammo on the reaper that spawns in the same field all the time and gives you almost nothing in return-Many mo..Wait that's it.CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION Customize your character using gold that you must purchase either with real money or hours of farming to get a key for a random loot spot that will generally give you some sort of mask!This game LOOKED promising several months ago, with lots of big plans written up. Apparently they decided to turn it into a cash grab. Save your money for one of the other titles currently in development such as The Forest, H1Z1, Rust, DayZ Standalone, etc, etc.			"

Early Access Review
								I spawned in a safe area and started doing what the boxes told me to do. I checked the map and saw a loot area, so I went there. A weird guy only wearing underwear I saw on the way started following me, and when I got to the loot area he just sat there watching me grab everything. I gave him a bag of crisps. I adopted him as my new pet. 10 seconds later a big gorilla thing killed him. I took revenge and mourned his loss. Then some guy shot me in the back of my head...best first 20 minutes I've ever had, 10/10 would like my pet back.			"

												I enjoy this game. I don't have hundred of hours poured into it, but I have owned and played it for over a year atleast. It's not a long haul game. Atleast not to me. To me the fun is in logging on every now and again just to see how long you can survive. The atmosphere is creepy. The monsters are scarey in sounds, appearances, and in how they fight you. It has a perma-death feature so once you die you loose all of that characters items and stats and must start over with a new character(though you can re-loot your old body if you're quick enough). You also have an account level that is constant. It takes a little longer to level up but grants bonuses to your character when you start out. This does provide some longevity to the game. However, eventually the atmosphere gets dul and you adjust to the sounds of the monsters and it becomes less scary/creepy. Maybe this game is meant to be more survival oriented, but the horror atmosphere adds a lot to the game. Once you get over it, however all that was added is lost. It is a FUN game. Don't get me wrong. The only tasks to do though are running errands. Your goal, most of the time, is to run boxes from one outpost to another and stay alive long enough to see how many runs you can do. This game is fun until it isn't. It's not that it's a bad game. It just fails to keep your attention(or atleast my attention). If it had a more obvious plot line and relevant missions it would be solid and I would play it for hours at a time. Maybe the point of the end of the world is to be pointless, but until then It's a game I will gladly play and enjoy playing for a few hours every month or two when the atmosphere feels fresh to me and I forget how panic inducing the monsters can be.

												I purchased the game during the Summer Sale since it was no longer marked Early Access. Beware, this is almost certainly still in a testing phase.My first launch was alright, and I wandered the wasteland until promptly being killed by another player. No big deal, I play DayZ as well. People are always ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. But then I selected the option that wasn't ""Change Character"" which promptly removed all menu options and controls. I had to exit with CTRL-ALT-DELETE. All further attempts to play the game have ended in failure. I can no longer get past the menu screen.A couple of friends bought it with me, one of them couldn't get past the menu screen, and the other was able to get past server select after it eventually started responding again. This took roughly 2 minutes.Another minor annoyance: When making an account it will say ""Login name already in use"" or something to that effect. What it really means is ""Display name already taken"". Misleading, and very annoying.			"

												Absolutely terrible. Even after all the possibly fixable server & stability errors the game itself is infested with overpowered shills camping near the safe areas. I can count the list of things that actually work in this game with one hand. Hitboxes, UI and stability do NOT belong to that list.Somewhat overused concept and poor execution of it.If you like waiting, walking, dying, overused ideas and buggy interfaces, pick one of the other post-apocalyptic games available.Do not make the mistake of purchasing this game like I did.

												Very underrated. Great game, nice graphics, good AI, large detaillled map, overall awesome game! Absolutely worth 10 bucks. It's just the population which is sadly quite low. However that's not a big problem, since there still are some decent populated servers, and that's not too much of a problem for a game like this, imo. It's also no longer p2w, the old - good - development team is back. Loot can be found at alot of places, you just need to get into the game to understand what's going on and where to find the loot. You can craft weapons easily and there's a decent amount of weapons, which are super-realistic. The game contains large PvP aspects, but it's not too hard to group up with other players and fight the Nether. Hackers are taken care of, there's a really small amount of hackers in the game atm. The community is not too bad, there really are some good people around who speak properly english too. Updates are slow, but the team is small so don't expect too much. The game is just super realistic and has alot of potential. I bought this game a few days ago, and I highly recommend it, great game!			"

												It was fun for me. But i ll can t make an objective critic about this game. This because kill an another human being is pretty hard, they have auto rifle or they re so desesperate they try to kill you with the beginning knife. The looting and the roaming in the map is fun but it don't work with my skype or teamspeak, so the fun just disapear when you re dommed to speak alone, fight alone, die alone.The Pk is common and everybody do it. I'm not an angel, i tried too, but i'm not verydone for that and my lone pvp kill is on a poor knife guy attempting to cut me in half. The Pve seems to be fun, but, the knife or most powerfull contact weapon have their limit with big big things. And the problem with guns, is the noise they do, just you didn't want occur, others players heard that and go kill you without any reason. It seems if devs added a rabbit orphanage where you ll have to bring stuff, people would make it always, saying... But man, it's a feature, it s why i do this all the time ! Uh...Coll game but for me, No. =p			"

												This game is pretty fun, you start off with  nothing and scavange around the map getting guns weapons and food. you try to survive the elements while also surviving strange monsters and murdereous players, alot like rust.the only downside is, the majority of the time playing you are running from somebody with a hack and it kills the fun of the game, I highly recomend you don;t buy anything from the store because odds are you will get killed and it will be a waste of money also, whenver you die you lose all your stuff and all you levels (i can unerstand the stuff but not the levels) so really you just survive 2 hours and put alot of work into the game to just get killed by some noob with a aim bot and then you waste your afternoon crying about it. The game has loads of bugs, you will get stuck on random things constantly, the graphics are alright but a bit bright.The fact you lose everything on death really sucks and takes alot of the fun out of the game (unless your one of those no-life people who enjoy gaining the same levels over and over again)as far as i can see the game doesn't even bother to take care of hackers so be prepaird to die... alot...all in all i give this game a 2/10 skip it and go play something better.

												I wanted to enjoy this game SO much. I love the whole post-apocalyptic setting, and in this game I could play with friends. WIn-win, right?Wrong.I bought it back in Alpha where things were relatively okay I mean, the hacking was just starting to appear, weren't that many spawn campers yet, and the atmosphere was okay.I don't know where everything went wrong, but it did; hackers in every server, still no PvE after months of asking, safezones getting camped by players who are either hacking, armed to the teeth, or both in most cases. The monster AI is terrible, a lot of people had trouble connecting steam to their account, me included, and the game itself never really left the Alpha stage sadly. It just gets tiring to spend 5-6 hours collecting stuff and killing nether and getting exp to die and start back at lvl 0 with a knife, doesn't help that no one is to be trusted in the game, which is sad.And don't get me started on the story, or whatever they call it in this game.

												I have played this game sense The Alpha days, and i really thought this was a great survival game! This was my very first survival type game that i have ever played. This Game has a few things  going for it. such as the super cool monsters that actually are a threat. unlike dayz the monsters are a major threat in this game. without some decent gear you are going to get destroyed.  The beautiful graphics makes the city feel like it was at one time a very lively city.  unfortunalty thats really all thats good about this game. There is a wasteland in the game which seems really cool, unfortunalty it really isn't. There is barely any loot and its just a waste of time going there. It's a shoot on sight type of  game. There aren't any friendly people in the game. The combat gets very repetitive very quick. With Melee weapons sometimes it feels like you are slicing through air. Over all I can only recomend this to people who are getting into the survival genre. For people who have played this genre for a long while STAY AWAY from this game its not worth your time.			"

												I bought Nether on sale after reading some positive reviews that compared it to other multiplayer survival games. The installation and creation of an account was fast & easy.  At the time i played ingame menu and server list tended to lagg heavily. There was no tutorial or intro whatsoever. I did not really mind the couple bugs i encountered like being stuck in corners or objects along with sudden disconnection. What really made playing this game a horrible experience is the amount of hackers on the servers matched with the heavy pvp orientation of most of the community if you want to call it one. Right now you are running around scavenging or solving tasks for an hour after having waited for a group to gather for usually twice the time just to end up loosing everything again due to an ambush, hackers or the lowest creep that might simply one-hit you out of nowhere. So right now this game is wasted time. Glad i bought it really cheap!  "

												This damn game was a waste of $20, spent money for their gold points just to find out I can't access my account. I tried forever trying to figure out what account is linked to my steam, but they don't even have a redeem account. I can't even play it, spent money on it just to be suckered by some undeveloped game. DO NOT BUY!			"

												       Neather, a game that requires more updates then Team Fortress 2, but lacks the fun that any game provides us with. This should be classified as a running simulator because all you do is run around an empty map, into empty buildings, and empty safezones. Nothing happens in this game. There is no other way to rate this game unless you classify it as a Running Simulator because that's all you do. Run. If you enjoy running around a destroyed map then buy this game as that is all you will do!			"

												This is an aweful game. Nothing works, absolutely nothing. First issue: When you first start up the game and get to the server list it freezes for a good 5 minutes + Second: When you spawn in for the first time you just spawn as an observing, floating camera, with no prompt as of what to hit to get to a menu, and no it's not the usual 'ESC', I had to hold the enter key. Third: All that starting cashing you're supposed to have and other items when you get the chosen package isn't in your inventory, you start off with a kitchen knife and no direction, no tutorial, nothing. I can't even see how this is considered a product. This is♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's not even Alpha stage, it's like a bunch amteurs got into an Arma map builder and made something in an afternoon after heavey morning drinking. I'm happy I got it on sale so I don't feel too screwed. Steam shouldn't allow these morons to sell anything and the game needs to be removed from the Steam store until they have something that is actually working and an actual game. This is pathetic.			"

												What you're shown: Intruiging storyline, challenging combat, survival on limited supplies, open-world co-op/pvp to add an element of danger.What you get: Hackers, cheats, glitchy monsters, buggy & unreliable loot drops, limited/linear means of progression (if it can be called that), excessivly punishing death/respawn system and a ""global inventory"" that leaves little to no room to store those important items and novelty loot or even a means of expanding said inventory.A real dissapointment, I am ashamed that I even bothered picking this up. Something that I would say about only three other games!Seriously, you'd be better off getting Team Fortress, at least it's free.			"

												So after playing awhile I can say that this game isn't beginner-friendly. One can spend 2 hours scavenging, playing it safe, being cautious, conservative and overall not being an idiot, but none of that matters. All your invested time and effort into obtaining the most basic foothold in the world is squandered with a single mistake and it's back to square one with an extended middle finger in your face.  I really wanted to participate in pvp, but I don't see the point if your skills and gear get wiped on death, you barely get any action in a firefight before you or the other guy has to go off, grind up skills again and try to get something halfway decent to fight with. Then there's always the chance you'll get capped from nowhere, then you have to try to regear and grind up skills again...I understand that this is supposed to be a survival game, but come on. I came in to be a part of some intense pvp, not constantly grind.			"

												I got Nether before what I believe was the height of its beta stage. At that point there were consistently 900+ players in game through Steam. I had agonized over the choice to buy it. I had heard of how players were constantly disappointed in Indie early access games that were never finished, etc. However a Steam sale came along and I and a few friends added it to our inventories. My computer isn’t the best so it was laggy, but still playable. I enjoyed running around, finding loot, dodging players, even working with some. Then came more updates. By the end of the beta I feel that Nether hit rock bottom. It was losing players by the week and many of their updates were turning into fixes and unnecessary content. Then they announced that they were moving out of beta into the official stage.I was surprised by this move.Now recently I have learned that the original developers have returned after the torch was passed to someone else. I didn't realize that the development tea had even changed, but I'm glad to see the old developers back. I will not be changing my thumbs down just yet though. I need some time to explore the reboot. However I am more hopeful that this game may become something great. For now, keep an eye on this one, but hold off buying unless you're sure you want to take the risk.			"

												WOW! They released the ""final version"" of this game? I honestly thought this still had about a year before the final , at LEAST 6 months before entering into BETA let alone releasing this half, no, quarter finished game from Alpha. Guess they figured it'd be an easy way to get a cash infusion by saying it's officially released since most of the early player base is gone due to the massive amount of open hacking and lack of generally anything to do. Seems mainly like a moneygrab while they can. I'd like to note this review wouldn't be so scathing if they had actually kept it in alpha and finished the game.During the beta, they put in this GIANT map alluding to the final version having a large map. Nope, they took a city block, stretched it out over a huge empty ""wasteland"" and had a handy excuse to not put jack in while saying they expanded the map. I'd like to say I was exagerrating about this but it's pretty literal.Here's a rundown of the features:EXPLORE Run around through the same buildings for block after block until you remember which ones actually have anything in them. Then farm loot spots/get killed by a hacker while trying.TRIBES AND TERRITORY WARS Do you like sitting in an empty building for fifteen minutes at a time to capture some arbitrary landmark with no real bonuses for your time? This is the feature for youPLAYER AND GROUP MISSIONS I suppose if you actually found someone not hacking or killing you on site traveling in the same general direction, you could consider the ""missions"" as group. Here's an all inclusive list of the myriad of missions available for completion!-Repeat the same fetch quest over and over and over again carrying a brown box from one safe zone to another! Sometimes to DIFFERENT safe zones!-Group up (wait that doesn't actually happen) to take down the nether surge! What's a nether surge you ask? Why, a group of nether out in the world trying to kill you. Is it a larger or more difficult group or really any different than the regular creatures that would spawn there? If you count a marker being added to your map that may or may not be near the creatures, it's different!- Kill a reaper for some reason! For only a short fifteen minute run from where you probably are, you can waste a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of ammo on the reaper that spawns in the same field all the time and gives you almost nothing in return-Many mo..Wait that's it.CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION Customize your character using gold that you must purchase either with real money or hours of farming to get a key for a random loot spot that will generally give you some sort of mask!This game LOOKED promising several months ago, with lots of big plans written up. Apparently they decided to turn it into a cash grab. Save your money for one of the other titles currently in development such as The Forest, H1Z1, Rust, DayZ Standalone, etc, etc.			"

Early Access Review
								I haven't played this game that much, but from what i've seen so far, i'm very impressed.I watched a couple of gameplay footage 1 or 2 months ago and i wasn't a fan of the game at all but i came across another series (little plug: pyschadelicsnake's intense nether diaries) and that series made me buy this game.Now about the game: The atmosphere is awesome. Especially if you spawn on the map at night and you go into the subway. Everything is dark so that you can barely see, the music is aggrieving, you hear nether screaming from above you and maybe gunshots from other people defending themselves against other nether.I like the scavenging in this game, you can enter pretty much every building in this game and the fact that loot is... at least most of the time relatively common. At least in terms of food and melee weapons.The little side-quests in this game are fun. You basically go to a safe zone, you pick up a package that you have to bring to another safe zone. If you do that, you get money and lots of xp. That's a pretty cool feature, because that way you actually have a goal than just ""surviving.""The only negative point i have is the pvp system. I mean yeah, it's a survival game, but as soon as you find other people outside of the safe zones, 90% of the time these players have either a pistol or a rifle and 99% of the time they are hostile and shoot on sight. As i said, i understand it, because it's a survival game, but it's massively pvp based and pretty much everyone is hostile. I think i have encountered about 7 players outside of the safe zones and every single one of them shot on sight.All in all i enjoy this game. The atmosphere is awesome. Fighting nether (especially with pistols) is a lot of fun as well as scavenging the area for food, weapons or ammo. I would definitely recommend this game.But as i said: Be aware that the game is heavily pvp.			"

												Nether is a survival horror game to be played with your friends.... or maybe alone?      Tag along with friends, or against foes in this survival horror that requires a lot of awareness and alertness in order to you and your crew to stay alive. It's got a hunger and thirst mechanic, as far as monsters lurking around in the world and no one to trust. Who will be friend, and who will be foe?      Let me start off with gameplay. It is terribly built. The movements and combat is not fluid or smooth in any way at all. Hit boxes are glitchy, and there are other plenty of bugs in the game, such as launching the game itself and crashing. The menu is even slow to load. And there are of course, your fellow♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag players online who camp in safe-zones and wait for you to run out and shoot you.      -     4 / 10      "

												It's a re-skinned War Z (Infestation: Survivor Stories) with some alternative gameplay mechanics. It has the same interface, animations and honestly there's nothing new or interesting about this title. Other than some other ""survival"" games that people like to hate on like DayZ, this game has very minimal survival involved. It's a huge deathmatch, you run around and hopefully find a gun and then go murder anyone you can see. Then you die and just do it all over again. It gets old very fast, especially as a solo player. This may be fun with friends, but I don't have anyone in my friendlist who would want to play this.  Also, at first the environment may look interesting, but you then come to realise that everything is just a copy and paste. The only two things I liked about this title was the AI, which is more fun fighting than the zombies in War Z, and the atmosphere, it really fit with the style of the game, creepy and scary. I defintely do not recommend this game, it just feels like another attempt at a cash grab.			"

												Simple way of it is this, don't expect to hold on to your gear and levels long. Most items you buy with either in game currency or RMT currency are dropped on death. this is only offset by low cost of the RMT items. I wouldn't even mind losing that stuff really but when you burn up hours of your time only to loose your character progression due to server connection...well there ya go.At least there is PVE now so you don't have to worry about getting stabbed in the back by other players. If you really want to try it, buy it cheap and have a romp. Depth wise it just doesn't seem to have enough to make me wanna keep it around. More so when cheap deaths kick in.			"

What does this mean? This means since early access they have done nothing productive to change their game for the better, visually or gameplay wise. They made a game with promises, then shoved it under the rug and said ""we're done"" as soon as they got all the money they wanted.**EDIT** 11/08/15NOW this game is ""Nether : Resurrected"" and it STILL uses the video recorded during the alpha stages of the game to sell their product....

												The game sucks. Its beta yeah, but not even near stable at all. The game is easy to hack if you really wanted. So call tribe system sucks too. You can join any tribe, but that doesnt mean people are royal. they can just kill you anywya.The nether devices, when they break down once in a while, its soo ♥♥♥♥ing annoying that you cant even stay afk for 5 minutes. I lost 2 hours worth of loot. Killed several people to finally get back to the so called ""SAFE ZONE"" and guess what? I ♥♥♥♥ing died in the safezone because the game totally sucks and its broken like hell. BETA MY♥♥♥♥♥ ITS SOO ♥♥♥♥ING BUGGY THAT IT MAKES MY EYES POPS OUT. THE FOV IS SOO ♥♥♥♥ING LOW THAT YOUR EYE HURTS AFTER 5 MINUTES!DONT ♥♥♥♥ING SUPPORT THIS GAME BY BUYING IT. ITS ANOTHER WAR-Z/Apocalypse SCAM LIKE ANY OTHER!			"

I've read and watched enough hate about this game to completely give up on it. I was thinking it would be worth $2.99 even if the game wasn't that great, but i honestly want my money back already.

												I first noticed this game when it came on to Early Access and I was quite interested in it. Granted, I didn't do much research into it and assumed it was your regular FPS RPG. Not really relavent but hey.Anyway, I then noticed it again while it was on sale and impulse bought it because I thought ""why not"". Honestly, I wish I had read reviews and looked into it more as the reviews you read are true.The game as a whole feels very unfinished even though it quietly came out of Early Access who knows when. I started not knowing at all what I was supposed to do, with a really badly set up tutorial which didn't help me at all, so I ended up not knowing what I was doing by the end of my first session either. I got past the tutorials and onto exploring, which just seemed pointless to be honest. Granted, I've onlt played just over an hour but I seriously doubt playing any longer will enrich the experience any further.Also, if you join a server with more than fifteen people on, you just get stuck in spectator mode and can only fly around doing nothing. There's also your classic problem of everyone losing any moral understanding of life and just shoot other players on site, irrelavent of the fact co-operation against a greater evil is probably a more fun option.I don't know why the devs haven't put any more work into it as I believe it really had potential (maybe it still does), but in it's current state I really can't recommend it. I probably won't even play it again until I here someone give it good, reasonable review.Graphics are good. There also might be some other hidden gems to add to a 'pros' list which I never discovered. That's about it.			"

												On my first try of this game I didn't know too much about it and no hints or tips are provided so inevitably I met my death. After some looking into it I was glad to see there being a global inventory so you can save something between lives. The game looks pretty good and it’s refreshing to see it in an unreal engine which meant movement was really easy unlike dayz. It is also more straightforward to understand health and consumables than in dayz.However, the cons for me make it unplayable:	You can spend a good while transferring a package from one safe zone to another and make a small amount of money, however if you die a fair percentage of your money gets taken from you, this accumulates greatly after a few deaths from just trying to leave a safezone.	That brings up the campers, endlessly I have left a safezone only to be immediately shot from god knows where.	The game does not let you see ‘killcams’ of any sort, so you really can just die and have no idea why. 	I have seen a few other players sprinting around the map at ungodly speed which I’m sure isn’t a perk or upgrade of some sort, so the game is completely unfair. 	You can finnaly be enjoying yourself to be shot down by another player	All the nether creatures I’ve come across so far can all teleport around you making killing enemies a little crappy and unskilful Overall if these problems persist even with many updates I don’t see the FUN in playing this game.

												MAJOR UPDATE: NOTHING has been improved. The map is still useless, there is no way to tell where you should be going even the during the few tutorial missions, and for God's sake would it kill the devs to put a reticle on the screen?!There is no one else playing. Anyone who is has a massive amount of patience. That being said, you will not be able to gather a team to do anything. You will not survive on your own. Just when you think you're safe, you get pounded into the ground by a low-level monster in only a few hits. What damage you are able to do to them is a total guess because the game has a horrible amount of lag between button press and action and there is zero indication that you are actually doing any damage. When the tutorial mission is damn-near impossible to complete, you should understand that the rest of the game is either the same or simply not worth your effort. Why punish the players for playing?On top of the horrible PvE, the PvP is an atrocity as well. Anyone who gets joy out of griefing other players by sniping them while they're in the safe zone must have some mental problems. There is no reward for this. Just the minuscule joy of killing someone at a low-level. Phosphor games has abandoned this title and for good reason: it didn't work on the first day and it still doesnt work. What could have been an amazing game is instead shredded with no hope of reconciliation, dignity, or refund.			"

												I bought this game when it came out in early access! I wanna give credit to Markiplier for showing this game to me because at the time it was fun playing with a group of friends in a survival situation. You get to run around finding guns, ammo, food, etc, surviving the night and the nether creatures that haunt you. Great times. But when it officially released, the game was far from what anyone had originally thought the game was going to be and how well the world would work out. The overall idea was fun and creative but now you got cheaters with auto aim, shooting 2 shots into your head where you instantly die. Newbs to this game will stand no chance of surviving for long, especially since they added this stupid tribe element to the game. It didn't make it better. Instead of survival and working together to defeat the nether and retake back earth, you're a gang of thugs killing others for territory. The world is gorgeous, graphics are pretty to look at and since its release, there are more places unlocked but it isn't all complete. Probably some DLC's will come out and more area's will be unlocked but you don't feel welcomed at all in this game. Its extremely hard to survive 15 seconds outside a safe zone once you leave it without players Following you, shooting you & taking your stuff. And yes, you have to start over every time, level 1 with one weapon! Its not about the Nether, its about the people you gotta watch out for now. The game started out as more of a group/team effort but its mainly every man with a gun and a group of thugs for themselves! I tried getting back into it but sadly was targeted way too many times and didn't make it as far as i use to be in Early Access. Places i wish i could visit in the game were simply too hard to get to because of people constantly hunting me and being forced to respawn in a new area every time. That's another thing, people loot the area's dry all the time to make it hard for new players to even advance! So bottom line i don't recommend this game at all. I wasted money on it and would of rather spent my money on DayZ or H1Z1. At the time i didn't like Dayz and picked Nether but wish i could change that. Also, the game feels like its been abandoned by its creators and probably just pushed it because people were getting ancy about its progress. I payed 20 dollars which looked like its ""Nether - Chosen"" But i see nothing special about my early access game. I didn't get any special weapons, items, nada. So if you really want this game, pay for the watcher if you must. 4/10.			"

												Look, I think the game had potential in the begining but it went downhill real fast. Granted, I'm not into survival mo's but this one is fun for a few days until it gets old. It's pretty much the same, live, die, repeat. The other problem is that this game was never really completed. The game is laggy, buggy, glitchy, full of hackers, and the world is incredably small and the gear you find can be great to absolute crap. They tried to add interesting things but by the time you get better gear your dead and its all pointless. Plus the main point is that the devolpers never fixed the obvious huge flaws the game has which shows that the game was a useless model to begin with. This should have been a free to play game, it is not worth a buck. The only reason I have it is because a friend bought it for me to play together and even he admitted that the game sucks. Don't waste your time with it until they devoloper finally grow a brain and add something that people actually want/need.			"

												Nether sets the mood for a post-apocalyptic wasteland with terrifying results, but this terror isn't the kind that sparks blood-pumping adrenaline or really any ""enjoyable"" feeling at all. Nether has a good theory behind the design, but the game's execution does not take into effect the inherent tendency of many gamers to grief, troll, or all around twist the gameplay mechanics to their liking. As a player of cut-throat PvP titles like DayZ and Rust, Nether's PvP system scares me. As a player entirely new to the game, dealing with dozens of blood-thirsty demons rampaging after you is enough. I'm sorry, but standing in a ""safe zone"" when the ""safety"" turns off and getting bludgeoned to death by a mob of trolling, crowbar-wielding noobs just shouldn't be a thing.			"

												okay im gonna start of by saying this is a great game after it cashe's 6 times trying to log you in and select your player but after that its a really fun game and yeah i only have for hours and my midn may change blah blah blah... but nah i like games like this and this so far has been better then most survival games out there rust sucks dayz is getting a little better but still sucks 7days to die is still beating all  of them and then the deadlinger is in the middle but from all the bad reviews thats on this game is most likely are from player that belive in a easy pase game where they dont have to worry about being shot by a player while killing a nether or vise versa to me i like the challange whe im being attacked by a player and a nether creature i kill the player first casue he's the biggest threat then the nether but heres a list of pros and consPros:nice craft system nice invitory systemrelly cool weaponsmoderate to tricky figting system wich i like alot has lot of diffrnet thing you can do like join a tribe kill the nether or escort ,etcalso if you get nether chosen you get the ability to become a nether creature wich is awesome the pvp is great if you knwo its coming but most follow you from a distance and sneak up on you while your serching something (spoiler:use a large shield it defelcts dammage and only take 2-3 hits max to kill)i could keep the list going....cons:its a littl buggy and glithc while aming by walls and walking in water and swiminggood guns are a little tricky to find.coould have more weapons and clothing and accesorys and also armorand that about it for the consbut ide rate this game a 8.5/10			"

Early Access Review
								Game should be $5. Its VERY similar to WarZ. Controls don't feel quite right. I play on ultra and have a gtx 780ti oc but graphics/textures/weapons/characters look like a 2004 game. Increasing the draw distance to MAX doesn't give you less fog (too much fog) it only cuts out distant buildings. Textures spazz out. When you get in the water...i dont know what happens. Maybe it's toxic. Either way, it's too glitchy to know if water is toxic or glitched. Feels like the WarZ guys put this game together quickly to cash in again on the survival horror genre. It's Early access, but I don't think this game can get better unless it's redone. If you must try it for yourself, I recommend not buying the chosen or belieber pack. Get the cheapest watcher pack.

												Is this game incredible, or what? I don't mean that as a rhetorical question. Can anyone tell me if the game is actually any good? I can't get past trying to create an account to try and play the thing, as the servers seem to be about as reliable as a bus with a tank full of sugar and two wheels missing. That, and the creation page itself won't even allow me to backspace and erase information, so every typo I made resulted in an excruciating process of reentering all the information again that can be likened to major reconstructive dentistry without anaesthetic. Maybe the game itself makes up for the phenomenal cake and♥♥♥♥♥♥party that is this login system, but I really doubt it, unless it ends poverty in Africa and cures syphilis. TL;DR: Extra authentication system included is as much use as a marzipan dild0. Avoid.			"

												What a super buggy piece of junk this is. Memory leaks galore, horrible optimization. The game itelf is pretty boring and poorly designed. I own over 100 games, only 2 of those I really regret buying, and this is one. I bought it on pre-release, had it all the way through beta, and now it's officially released, although it still looks and plays like a beta. Do yourself a favor and get one of the many good open world survival games currently available. Message me and I can give you a list of good ones, I own pretty much all of them in this catagory.			"

												I bought this game in October 2013 while it was available for early access, with big hopes for it to become THE survival game. Now that it's out as a full release, it still feels like an early access title. I have spent something like 10 hours in total in this game.There are still bugs present that I expected would be ironed out, like menus not stealing focus of your mouse control, clipping through items (even small fences), weird lighting errors and collision boxes not properly aligned in f.ex. stairs or ramps (you sometimes have to jump from the floor onto the ramp). The premise and potential this game had was huge, but it fails to deliver.I once stepped into water to try to take a little shortcut, but instantly took damage and had big problems getting out of the water again because swimming doesn't seem to be implemented. They also added a tutorial that IMO is useful for people who have never touched an FPS game before, but it is poorly explained and just gets in the way of the open world gameplay you want to jump into.The game world is beautiful, but there is little fun to be had in this game.

												I can say that Nether is a game that had great potential but rolled out well before its time. The Devs were too greedy and instead of having an amazing end product, you have a bug ridden world that doesn't promote anything fun and welcomes hackers. The most fun i had in this game was the exploration - hidding with my rifles in the tall grass avoiding other players. Searching for loot that would potentially keep me alive. But in the end, we all die and the frustrating part is to start all the way over losing all your gear. To buy new gear you can spend ""gold"" which is obtained via your credit card. Its the easiest way of getting the best gear - or you just spend the in game money (which you would lose 45% of it upon your death...). After sinking a bunch of personal money into the game, they revamped the inventory system causing me to lose my gear. All my money that was put into the game was for nothing. Maybe I'm a bit to bitter, but there definately isn't enough depth in this game to make me forgive the loss and I'm honestly not willing to spend anymore time with the game unless there are some major, major improvements.

												I bought this when it was first released on steam and watched it go through its dev stages. From pictures and some videos it looks like this game would be great, as if it would have an I am Legend sort of feel and it does, it is just poorly executed. For one I would much rather prefer some sort of enemy or zombie that is just there in a world instead of randomly spawning out of who knows where and who knows when, it just never made any sense and wasn't alot of fun. I didn't like the fact that when you die you lose everything, it didn't bother me in Dayz because it felt more like a Walking Dead you better watch your back and who you trust esque game. But this just wasn't like that. Instead of safe zones I wish they could have made it where you have some sort of safe house where you can discover, or build yourself and upgrade (Board windows, set traps etc..) safe zones honestly seemed really stupid and uncalled for, the sense of urgency and need to survive completely goes away not to mention vendors weren't all that great. The graphics were pretty sub par as well as the overall controls. Overall the premise of the game itself just wasn't very interesting. I never felt like I was working toward anything or working to improve my character, loot or my safe house.			"

												Here's a real, non-fiction account of my time playing Nether.Spawned in for the first time since a year ago.Did tutorial missions until I got a can gun.Killed a few Crawlers with can gun, was proud of myself.Safezone defences failed.Was promptly killed by horde of crawlers and giant-armed thing.Life 2: Spawned in-world, safezone still not safe. Was stuck with knife. Lost 200 health trying to swim by holding space. Wandered for 10 minutes. Attacked by horde, jumped in water, lost another 200 health in the swim. Found a store full (not really) of energy drinks, candy bars, and the jackpot, a shovel. Left store, three minutes later machine gunned down by a player. He took my cash, all 40$ of it, and nothing else.Do I recommend this game? No. Would I if PVP was disabled and safe zones STAYED SAFE? Yes. As it is, dying from trying to swim, dying from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ players with machine guns, and dying from being armed only with a butter knife? No, not at ALL>			"

												Do not buy this game, do not even play the game if you get a guest pass. I bought the game way back when it was first placed on steam and was really looking forward to it. Here are a couple things that killed the game for me.The monsters teleport to you makes it so you can not run away. You start out with a kitchen knife and nothing else. You starve to death in a very small amount of time. When you die you loose all of your gear and XP. If you are lucky enough to find a weapon, do not fire it unless you are ontop of a building because every nether in the area is going to hear it and then you are S.O.L.If another player sees you outside of a safe zone, there is a 99.9% chance that they are going to attack you.There is an in game store that makes the game ""Pay to win"" Still waiting for the PVE servers...

												[EDIT] (please comment if you don't find this usefull)Today, after 6 months, the game didn't change at all from my previous and first atempts to play it except for one thing. The server browser now loads within a few seconds (oh and there are a few ""emotes"")... Well, that's a start.It is still very buggy with poor optimisation. The game still crashes randomly.Weapon and character movement still feel weird. You get stuck sometimes on edges and corners when you crouch which forces you to stand up.Enemy AI is non existent, you just turn around and punch them in the face with ease and in case you get hit, just walk to any nearby store, they get refilled quite often.No marks on the map to tell you who is where nor any way for you to take notes so you have to run around in safe zones to find what you need and remember it.The game feels boring after a couple of hours of hoarding items to your global inventory in the first safe camp. After that you start hunting other players because nobody reads the chat or want's to collaborate (unless you have a friend or two). They tend to shoot on sight anyway...Servers are limited to 60 players but i've rarely seen more than 30, and the map is huge ...When you kill something or open a container, you have about 60 seconds to collect everything so this means that sometimes half the loot will disapear in thin air (it takes between 2 to 4 seconds to collect each item).Well, at least the atmosphere is well done and the metro sections feel spooky. Kudos to that.Late-June 2014 :So much bugs. It randomly crashes after a while, the game takes ages to load the server list (10 full min the first time, 2 full min the next) (hi end gaming laptop that runs The Witcher just fine at max settings just for comparison), questionable game design decisions (game UI and menus, interactivity, markets, player names, keys ?!? ...), global emptyness due to static environments with lots and lots of buggy colision detection and god does this lag so much....Don't buy, even at discount. This still feels like an alpha release except you're paying full price. No, really, don't. If you're looking for a survival game, go back to the DayZ mod or check out ""Sir you are beeing hunted"" ...Check it out in a a few months and if you find comments to this post stating that all issues listed on the official forum were addressed as well as improvements to player communication (gestures for example), then maybe consider it again.All in all, the live action trailer is the only good thing about the game.

												This game is quite okay regarding the gameplay, but until they do not fix the problem to get bugged at any tree or in water or at any wall, it is unplayable.Their unstuck function even is a suicide, very nice to lose position and packages, if you don't want to log out angrily regularly then I recommend not to play this game.

												Here's a real, non-fiction account of my time playing Nether.Spawned in for the first time since a year ago.Did tutorial missions until I got a can gun.Killed a few Crawlers with can gun, was proud of myself.Safezone defences failed.Was promptly killed by horde of crawlers and giant-armed thing.Life 2: Spawned in-world, safezone still not safe. Was stuck with knife. Lost 200 health trying to swim by holding space. Wandered for 10 minutes. Attacked by horde, jumped in water, lost another 200 health in the swim. Found a store full (not really) of energy drinks, candy bars, and the jackpot, a shovel. Left store, three minutes later machine gunned down by a player. He took my cash, all 40$ of it, and nothing else.Do I recommend this game? No. Would I if PVP was disabled and safe zones STAYED SAFE? Yes. As it is, dying from trying to swim, dying from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ players with machine guns, and dying from being armed only with a butter knife? No, not at ALL>			"

Early Access Review
								A lot of people compare this game to Dayz.This game is much more difficult. Monsters are not easy to evade and you must fight them to survive. Theres no escape.. This makes you think twice if you wanna go out in the open making noise like stupid or go stealth all the time crouching (what you're supposed to).. Yes its easier to get stuff and guns in Nether than in Dayz, but ive faith that it will be more challenging as the game develops a much bigger map.The only way to keep your weapons is with the global inventory. This is a downside imo because it takes away all the realism as you dont have to worry too much for your gear.. This makes it more forgiving but doesnt mean its a really bad thing.Graphics are not top notch but they are really good.. in fact i think the post apocalyptic world is way better than Dayz's.You see broken streets, grown trees, collapsed buildings, smoke columns and lots of other stuff.Weapons sound cool and monsters can make you jump from time to time with their screams. All and all this is a great game and you should try it and support!8/10			"

												I bought this game 4 days ago. I e-mailed Nether support on day 1 because I was unable to link my Nether account to Steam due to a client error: ""Status: Failed. Steam client must be running if you bought Nether from Steam and have not linked your Mber account."" I looked on the forums and their support FAQ and followed those steps to no avail. On day 2, they responded back to me telling me to do what I already did, which didn't help (open Steam and the Nether launcher, version 24 or later, and they'll autoconnect). On that same day, I e-mailed them back my SteamID like they asked so they could link the game to my account. It's now day 4, and the game's still not working for me, no response from support. Total real playtime: 0 hours. Total amount paid: $4.10/10 totally worth it.Will update review when I actually get to play the game.			"

												Terrible game with incredible potential... Too sad. Don't buy it, please. I cannot recommend it for such a price... 1-4 EUR would be acceptable. Not so 10 EUR!The reasons why the game is bad (based on my 1 year long alfa/beta experience):- terrible servers- terrible optimization- insane graphic requirements to make the graphics bearable- very weird light effects and ugly nights (play it and you will see what I mean)- lack of story in a game where PvP sucks (first shooter wins... usually a camper)- game still looks like if it was in alfa or beta- tons of bugs- apparently a stupid engine used or stupid designers- low fps if I want to play with at least decent graphics (I have actually a good graphics card)- money-hungry devs (a new DLC released when the original game still sucks and has ton of bugs? Really?)On the other hand we should not forget some pro's too:+ nice frightening atmosphere+ nether monsters (enemies)+ quite good A.I. (considering how stupid the engine is), however sometimes limited by poorly designed environment (monsters get stuck in textures.. this holds true for players too). But the A.I. itself is good and believable+ guns+ underground metro+ urban environment (quite balsy to develop)+ it is hard to survive (you must eat/drink)I bought the game as alpha access and I don't regret that at all... I learned from my mistake and never bought early access or beta version access on Steam again. And I never will...The game looked so promising at the beginning... It was exactly what I wanted and longed for... A post-apocalyptic game set in a (ruined) city with survival elements and heavy atmosphere... However, the longer I played the game the more I realized Nether will never be finished.Devs decided to choose QUANTITY approach (new zones, new monsters, new guns) instead of QUALITY approach (better optimization, better graphics, better animations, better engine maybe, better playing experience). The result is something you can play today.			"

My opinion is this game is from a shell company owned by Sergey Titov who made the War-Z game.  Due to all the bad press his company and game has gotten, he now resorts to creating new LLC companies and changing his game names.  War-Z chaged to Infestation and then changed again to ""Romeros Aftermath"".  Save your move and look elsewhere.			"

												I would have given this game a great review BUT they finished it. The day they said ""this is a finished product"" is the day I gave up hope for it. This game could have been great. Unfortunately it fell short of being that. This is not a finished product.It still has massive glitches. There’s a glitch where you just keep walking forward. It has been there since I first started playing. IT'S STILL THERE. There are lots of graphical glitches with my GTX770. I e-mailed them numerous times and all I got was ""turn all the settings to High."" Lots of glitches getting stuck inside/between/above things which can really be awful if you're being attacked.The skill tree/leveling system is fruitless. It's just boring. Not a lot to choose from, Not a lot to specialize in. The game itself isn't much of a game. There is no real point. There are few things to work towards that are going to keep your attention for long. Few guns, No specialty items, nothing really satisfying to do other than mess up other players, which for any normal person will lose its novelty after a short while.  Spend REAL WORLD MONEY on a limited selection of stupid looking clothes, supplies and gold keys.  I truly had many hopes for this game, but they just decided to drop development and claim it’s a finished product. It’s truly sad.  "

												Some advice for anyone thinking of buying this game, DON'T DO IT!I bought this game around launch with no major issues, the game was okay at best and had alot of bugs but at least it was somewhat playable. However, during the steam summer sale of this year a few of my friends decided to buy it as it was only around £2 and I agreed to give it another go as I had hoped the game would have improved in the 6 months or so since I played it last. One friend couldn't even log into the game as the patcher send him through a seemingly infinite process of trying to link the steam account to a nether account which is impossible. Me and my other two friends managed to get through without that problem but we were faced with a number of crashes and bugs which made it impossible to get into a server. Games as unplayable as NETHER shouldn't even be allowed to be on steam.			"

												STAY AWAY!This game is a scam. Don't buy it. You won't be able to play it. It requires you to connect your Steam account to Mber account to be able to play. It just doesn't work anymore.There is no support for this game. Developers dumped this game in august.Besides that the game contains multiple bugs and glitches which were there since early access. The game is filled with cheaters. Noone ever bans cheaters in this game.			"

												This game has had all sorts of account issues - I have now had it for about 10 hours and still cannot get access to the game. I have tried solutions in the forum, but it is clear I am suffering from bugs the developers have been aware of (and have declined to address) for months. I will update this review if this gets fixed, but at this time I have paid $16 US for the privilege of getting nothing and spending hours of my time trying to fix something that seems almost intentionally broken.

												So, Nether. I initially picked this up and played it during the beta and would not have recommended it then (as seems to be the general opinion, judging by the Early Access reviews).My two major complaints were simple. First, the movement felt wonky and made gunplay in PvP feel incredibly odd. Secondly, it was hard to be immersed in the atmosphere when most things were decorated with nothing but trash bags. If you've looked at whether or not I've recommended this game, then you might surmise that these issues were rectified.The game does have its issues, no doubt. However, what's really doing it for me is the atmosphere. There is a lot of detail, a lot of tall grass to hide in and plenty of places to hide from enemies. As far as post-apocalyptic survival goes, this does it for me.Let's go over some of the main points!Safe ZonesThere are zones in the game that are totally safe. You cannot kill people in these zones, you cannot even bring up your ironsights. This very well might put some people off of the game, especially those wanting an experience similar to DayZ or perhaps Rust, where you want PvP all the time, anywhere. However, I appreciate the difference. It's nice to come back after a courier mission and take some time to relax and plot your next action.This is made a little more interesting by the fact that these safe zones periodically... well... become unsafe. You can kill people, you can kill invading monsters. Watch your trigger finger... or keep an eye out for someone that looked at you funny early on.Survival AspectsThis game is not detailed when it comes to survival. You need to eat, you need to drink, you need to keep your health up. You won't bleed out, you won't get poisoned. It keeps this aspect of the game simple. If you've eaten enough food, you regenerate health slowly. Very slowly. But it is a nice reason to stay well-fed.You'll find yourself scavenging for foodstuffs, weapons, ammo, cash. You'll kill monsters and get their skin, claws and skulls. Honestly, if you're after something super-detailed here, probably not for you. But if you don't mind the simplicity and just want some reason to eat food while hunting for people/monsters/etc., then it does the trick.Monsters and PvERight, so there are monsters in this game. They're called 'Nether', but that always makes me try to come up with some inappropriate innuendo. Either way, what is the AI like? Not great, but surprisingly... not bad. They'll run at you, they'll call for nearby monsters to help and... they'll teleport and try to get behind you -- yes, teleport. It's a thing they're meant to do, not a buggy weirdness. They can chase you fairly effectively, handling the inside of buildings well enough to pose a threat and even able to climb stairs after you.On their own, they're really nothing to worry about. If you have a knife, you can likely kill one no issue. It's when they're in groups that they're a danger. But there's more than just the AI to worry about once the shots start ringing out as you desperately try to cling to life...PvPOutside of safezones, it's free reign. Kill whomever you want. The game has a mechanic where you can join a 'Tribe'; pick one out of several colourful, but standard, apocalyptic factions and fight for them to take territory and earn rewards. Don't worry -- you can still kill fellow tribemates! There is a reputation system that discourages you from doing so and wanton fratricide will see you kicked out from your tribe.There is an interesting mode of gameplay I'm fond of. Playing AS one of the monsters. You can buy a potion for relatively cheap (with in-game money), drink it and get the option to become one of the creatures. Some clunkiness to be had here, you have to log out and log back into the server, then choose your character as a monster. Monster mode, however, is fun. You don't lose anything on death, you're fast, you're nimble and you're practically blind. It changes up the experience in a way I quite enjoyed. What I like most about this is that you're always left wondering if the monster over yonder happens to be a player... and if they have a pack of friends.Oh and you can group with friends pretty easily, if that's something you like to do.Overall, PvP is perhaps limited when compared to other titles. You won't be kidnapping anyone and sacrificing them to volcano gods, you won't be forcefeeding them bleach. But you will be feverishly glancing up at windows and wondering if someone is watching you.Levels/ProgressionOne thing that puts people off is that you can gain levels, build your character... then you die and lose all the hard work. The developers have mitigated this with an 'Account Level' system. You get perks that persist... nothing huge, but nice perks that give you some overall accomplishment. The game keeps track of your overall PvP and PvE kills, which is a nice touch. Thankfully, rebuilding a character is not a massive undertaking and you can get the primary perks you want in an incredibly short amount of time. Does this maybe kinda cheapen it for the more-hardcore crowd? Maybe. I don't mind it and I have other games to get my hardcore gaming cravings satiated.IssuesSo, there are some problems. I don't feel it's gamebreaking, but it's worth noting. Technically speaking, the graphics are nothing special and perhaps a bit dated. I feel that they make up with this with a great deal of atmosphere -- this is something you'll have to decide on your own after checking out some videos or screenshots. It might be a little hardware intensive for what you get.Sounds can be a touch funky. Especially underground. You're never sure if the gunshots you hear are just around the metro tunnel bend or... actually just above you on the street level.Terrain can be odd. There are cases where you're moving over some ruined rubble and you suddenly start levitating in the air. Like, way up. You continue on and you find yourself sinking into the rubble. Odd stuff like that -- thankfully, it's not the norm.The UI is... mreh. Kinda funky. Backpacks don't 'equip', you have to just have them in your inventory. And sometimes you have to drop them and pick them back up. The skill menu doesn't tell you exactly what stuff does, so you end up having to look up what the mysterious %+ boosts are actually doing as you level up your Survival skill. Similarly, crafting suffers from odd menu stuff as well... functional, but not pretty.ConclusionAll in all, I just wanted an atmospheric survival game in a post-apocalyptic setting. And yeah, this does that pretty well. Honestly, the atmosphere is just fantastic by my reckoning. I would compare it to a bit of Metro 2033 mixed with DayZ's openworld PvP. It has issues... but it has a lot of fun, if you're a fan of the setting and the genre. Will it last you in the long run? I'm planning on playing it for a fair bit more, at least. I think it's worth a shot and can keep you entertained for a good amount of time... and that's something I definitely would not have said for it in Early Access.If you've tried it out before, it might be worth taking a second look.

												--UPDATE May 24 2016--I posted a hopeful and honest review previously. With the original company coming back and promising a rework, I was very hopeful for the game.That being said, these guys haven't touched this PIECE OF GARBAGE since my original review. There are no updates, nothing. I think they made the announcement to make additional profit before this game fully dies.DO NOT BUY, you were warned.--Previous Review Jan 16 2016--There is a huge split between Positives and Negatives and I understand both sides.Here's my ""neutral"" review. I want people to give this a chance, but I will thumb this down because I can't really say this is a game yet.Pros:Interesting conceptNot a purely player driven entertainment (no fun without players ex: dayz)Cons:buggyminimal contentvery little player basegraphics quality is mediocreDetails:Here's the jist on why this game is being thumbed down to all hell by some people. This game was contracted out to Phosphor games and then when their contract finished, taken over by another group. The game, once out of Phosphor game's grasps, changed to a microtransaction based pay to win game.And other people highly recommend this game as the original devs have taken over, took out all the progress and mistakes the other company did, and are looking to develop it all over again.I applaud the original devs for doing this and I hope this game goes well.I purchased this game for $1.00, on sale, as I had wanted to play this game for so long.The game, at its current state, is not much at all.The game is playable, but very buggy. You may not be able to walk over things crouched, get stuck on corners of buildings, mobs may jitter around, mobs may get stuck...etc. However, it is still playable.The game has very little content. The map is large, but at the base level the game is: deliver a package, escort a deliverer, defend a safe zone (it's actually defend yourself until you fix the anti nether machines). Killing mobs/nethers and killing other players, I did not include as content as these are things that you do anyways.Additionally, as the game looks very underdeveloped and there is such little content, there are not many people on. There are about 20 servers total with none of them being full most of the time.That being said, I find Nether to be fun and really just the main thing being that it has little content. If content can be added, this game would be quite fun.Though limited, the forms of combat and approach to exploring the cities are great. Sneaking is a real thing and you can level up your efficiency of stealth by leveling.Each Nether/mob is different and must be combated differently. Due to this, they are actual real threats and players must not only be cautious. but smart. This offers an additional entertainment value besides player killing. This also promotes cooperation as purely pvping is not always the best.As mentioned before, this offers entertainment based not purely on other players. You can play this game solo and still enjoy it. Such games like DayZ require you to have other players to enjoy it, as it is a garbage game. (It's not even a sandbox, it's just an environment with players).What I would like to see:trapsdiversity of building layoutsmore exploration of buildings, inside houses, different floors to buildingsmore items and craftingmore variety of nethers/mobsroof top access to buildings.

												This game is dead, and no longer maintained by the developers. A moderator on their forum even suggests reporting this game as broken, so that people wont waste their money by buying a non functioning game.Here's the link to the forum: https://forums.playnether.com/showthread.php?11785-To-All-You-Nether-PlayersQuote:""To All You Nether PlayersI'm supremely sorry at how nether's fallen apart, but honestly it's been going that way for a long time. I'd suggest being very careful if you really want to continue playing nether, as it's come to my attention that if you pickup items that a hacker drops, it could cause you to get a vac ban on your account. As steam almost universally stonewalls any attempts to appeal a vac ban, and the people in charge of nether now are barely custodians it seems, there's really no chance of getting any help in case this happens.EDIT: I also suggest that you report nether on it's steam page as being broken, as the multitude of installation errors, play errors, crashes, and non-working servers, in their own right deserve to be reported. Hopefully we can get nether taken down once and for all, and save any more people from losing either money or their clean status on steam.""			"

												First off, I don't quite get why this game is so loathed by the community. I'm loving it so far. Sure, the environments are a bit bland but the game is still being worked on. From what I've heard, the developers regained control of their product and made it better than it was before. They removed all of the P2W elements which is honestly a great thing because the game no longer feels like it's ripping you off.I like that it's such a unique take on the survival genre. It's all in first person and it's tense as Hell!If you like First person shooters and the idea of a first person survival game appeals to you, give it a shot. P.S. It's also really eerie. Especially when you hear a Nether screeching while you're exploring, and you don't know where it's coming from. Haha.			"

												At this point I feel urged to contact steam about doing something against companies like this one.Scamming people with early access, never fully developing the game, stoping to update their own page (last update was 6 months ago) and frankly never fixing major game breaking bugs. This company clearly hasnt got the resources, a 2 week server downtime where noone could play and that was not even commented by the Devs is enough proof.Not to mention hackers on everycorner.BUT: they DID have enough resources to implement a pay to win shop.STEAM!

												This game had/has so much promise and the devs seem to ♥♥♥♥ it all up with their stupid♥♥♥♥♥updates......  ***update review***News flash dumbass devs add DLC to broken♥♥♥♥♥game. Speaking of Stupid♥♥♥♥♥updates the retard devs put last man standing in this game for some unknown reason I am the most serious I have ever been Devs what the total ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with you I mean seriously.  Hello it was already a pvp game you say pvpve but that is a joke and you put another pvp type thing in it you are so.....I cannot think of a word that describes how utterly stupid you are I wish I could make a word up to sum it up.Ok sorry for that now for the serious review.First off I have had fun playing....at times.....mostly.....When you get to the point in the game where your comfortable in getting around and understand the layout of the city and how to get weapons its an ok game just ok not awesomely great super game, or phenomenally addictive, just ok well slightly ok, maybe a little under ok.Secondly the devs of this game seem to me to have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what to do with their game.  Oh well we want pvepvp to mesh. Well wouldn't that be ♥♥♥♥ing great except for the fact that its just a giant pvp death match with monsters thrown in. GG.  I mean I don't mind pvp but you put things in this game for people to work together on and thats pretty much all there is to do in the game aside from running damn cardboard boxes from one safe haven to the next praying that your delivery zone doesn't get attacked by nether......because it does....all the time....then your carrying around 50 ♥♥♥♥ing lbs of♥♥♥♥♥♥and wondering what to do for an hour so it fixes itself.  Cause if you go into that town and try to fix the nether repelling machines yourself you will get♥♥♥♥♥raped by the too many ♥♥♥♥ing nether in there or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who went there also, yep thats cooperation right there im talking to you mother♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who shoots when people are trying to fix the nether machines.  That is not survival that is annoying as hell. All of the implemented things in this game to do is designed for co-op and people avoid them like the plague because they go to have fun and get stabbed/shot in the back by some sadistic ♥♥♥♥ waste.  So heres the things you will find yourself actually doing in this game as of now.1. Getting shot when you spawn and all you have is a butter knife<--no joke there. The fix for this?  Log into an almost empty server that's what every one says to do.  My point in bringing that up?  If you log into an empty/almost empty server to avoid the other people playing your failing at MP and should have just made it a single player game and that's just sad, but you will have ""veteran players"" use logic, rage, and anything else they can pull outta their♥♥♥♥♥♥to defend this..... 40 hours is enough to see this game is not really all that fun and quickly loses its new game sparkle.  I can log in and max level my toon/avatar/clone in like 30 minutes and I have killed over 500 nether and only 1 player and that was because he was stabbing me in the back while I was trying to fix nether machines, I killed him waited next to his stuff so he could come back to get them before they despawned and asked him why he attacked me? His answer? I scared him....THE ♥♥♥♥?  He scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta me I didn't even see him even if I had I would have left him alone not because I am a nice person but because you don't have to shoot them just because they are standing there. Oh well as you can figure out yourself it should take a new player that's decent at fps maybe 10-15 hours(maybe less maybe more) to figure this game out and the rest of the time your bored with lack of content and avoiding other people. 2. avoiding anything that looks like fun because some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ also thought it would be fun and saw you and instead of helping kill the nether reaper he shoots you then dies himself while screaming this is survival because he is a waste of life.3. Running carboard boxes that weigh more the hulks green testicles from one town to another to get money<---which btw is what is recommended by the same people who go around killing everyone because they are bored with this boring game but say its an awesome game anyway.4. deciding that the co-op stuff like nether reapers and fixing nether machines and escort mission sounds fun, go to do it and just end up getting shot because your taught in this game from the forums/community that anything put into this game other than shooting each other and hauling heavy♥♥♥♥♥boxes should be avoided.Also Phosphor where the hell is my nether gold that was lost due to your buggy programming at?  I have emailed you 3 times over this and you contact me then never do anything about it? 5. Logging in and hiding in a corner/rooftop/town entrance to shoot random people because you have no life and have ruined all the other fun things in this game as few things that are ""fun"" exist.To be honest they had a great game here a wonderful game and they ♥♥♥♥ed it up because they are more concerned with their cosmetic store and having a million stupid emotes that cost nether gold...my God those emotes are ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and not needed but thats what they worked so hard on.  Not that you have to buy them oh no you have 3 free ones that are also stupid and not needed because no one will see your emote, you will be shot before you finish it.  Even though every useful item in the game is able to be bought with in game money..they focus so hard on the items that can be bought with nether gold and do little else to help their failing game.  Don't let this game fool you into thinking it is a finished product even though they released it as such it should be in early access still but phosphor is full of greedy gits and they wanted to make money by taking it out of early access so steam would put it on the front page so they could make some more money....hell the entire city isn't even finished only 2 areas is accessible, you still clip through the floor and hills float on top of piles of rocks and buildings, added a dirk bike<---why? thats broken and some kind of carish thing<---also broken and have yet to patch it because we needed emotes and a uncle sams hat for the 4th<---to be fair only cost 1 dollar.Tribes are a joke they were put into the game to enourage team play and lessen the kos and pvp but it doesn't work I have been shot and killed more times by my tribesmates than any other thing in this game and they still steal your items and say they despawned.Save your money. Just save it Don't buy rust<--I also own it and the devs of it doesn't know what the hell they want their game to be either and it's community is just as toxic as this one.  Dayz is just boring as hell, and the graphics engine is more broken that an old mans thigh bone after falling down 3 flights of steps.<---also owned.  Just avoid all early access ""survival"" games nether included because its still early access. No matter what phosphor says this game is unfinished piece of boring crap.If you must buy a ""survival"" game please go to the forums and read heavily what the community says.

												This game was awesome, and sadly  got picked up by a bad dev, which ruined it. While I applaud the old devs picking it back up, I'm sad to see it die. I don't blame them, the game suffered alot of damage, and they had to roll it back to when they were the original devolopers, which probably didnt help it.That being said, the game itself is quite fun, and could -possibly- come back if it got more positive publicity!

												Although Nether is advertised as a survival game, surviving on your own is no problem at all. Unlike a other survival games where you can die from natural causes and build bases, Nether feels more like a giant deathmatch where you scavenge for weapons and equipment. The only survival you will have to do is to fight off players and the alien nether alike. I find this to be a great game for players who are looking for fast, intense action and who aren't interested base building or always worrying about their nutrition meter. The atmosphere of the game is amazing. The models themselves are not the most realistic, but they fit really well together to make for an awesome map. There are points of interest in the map, but every part of the map has loot in it and the possibility of generating missions so that you'll want to keep exploring. The map is relatively small which makes for frequent player encounters (every 20 or so minutes) on medium populated servers and make most areas a worthy destination. However, if you prefer to be alone, you can always join a server with few people to scavenge more easily.Another big factor to the atmosphere are the alien nether who are NOT zombies for once. There are various types of nether and those types have different abilities and tiers that make them tougher than the base type. They each have a teleportation ability in common that makes them especially dangerous since they can appear anywhere around you. This is not instant though, the nether has to travel before reappearing so it is possible to outrun them, but very hard due to stamina being too small unless you carry energy items. A pack of nether can make for a challenging experience if you are ill-equipped. Once you have obtained a few weapons, they can be dispatched easily, but doing so with guns will result in nearby players and nether being attracted to you (remember what I said about the map being relatively small?). They almost always make a fun encounter especially in missions where their number and variety increases.To kill off your opponents, you use an arsenal of 1 primary, 1 secondary and 1 melee weapon. There are quite a few weapons in nether, but not enough if you ask me and unfortunatly you can't modify any of them with attachments. These weapons are all very hard to use with high recoil and aim sway which mixed with a bad healing system (just hold the use key for the item for 3 seconds and instantly heal) can make long range kills very hard without the perfect timing or a combined firepower of another teammate. This can be good in the way that you have a chance to run away, fire fights are longer, but the healing system needs to change because someone behind cover can just keep using all their healing items at their disposal with no penalty. There are NO PAY-TO-WIN items in this game. I don't know where people get this notion since there aren't even any guns for sale on the market and everything else can be bought with in-game currency.There is a level system in Nether that makes dying something you want to avoid which in turn makes it worth while to fight for survival. It takes about 30 minutes to get all the skills you want from the skill tree and one hour to reach max level, but you lose this progress on death. These skills can grant you gun damage, health, backstabbing with melee weapons, etc. There is also a secondary leveling system that is persisten even after your character's death. These account bonuses grant you smaller stats, but are still very welcomed.Furthermore, to kill off enemies you will prefer to be in a team. Teams are mostly made between tribes (or randomly) inside the safezone and everyone else you encounter on the map is generally hostile. But it isn't as bad people make it out to be. In many situations, I tried voice chatting that I am friendly, waving hello, or helping someone fight a pack of nether which usually worked for me. Maybe I'm lucky, but most people will not shoot if they see you've spared their lives somehow or helped them fight off whatever was attacking them. Even when you do get killed, the relative fast pace of the game makes it so you can get decent gear quickly. To promote teamwork, the devs have made randomly generated missions such as defending safezones from nether, killing off a boss nether and added tribes that work together to capture territory for interesting bonuses. There is the occasional♥♥♥♥♥that will refuse to play nice and kill you while you are trying to rescue the safe zone, but it's to be expected. Don't blindly trust people when you are sporting all your best gear too.You don't carry most of the loot you find on you, there is a small stash where you can put the most valuable loot in and a market where you can buy minor healing or nutrition items for cheap with cash that is mostly earned by doing escort missions, killing players or looting.There are a few bugs in the game, but it is getting better and the 2 patches this month have been geared towards preventing hacking. I myself have only encountered 1 hacker during my playtime. Recently, the devs did a great job of adding new landmarks in the map, changing loot disposition, increasing team play rewards and increasing the toughness of nether and giving each territory a unique bonus. Hopefully they keep at it and steer the game into something even more enjoyable.Oh yea did I mention you can play as a nether and troll people? "

Early Access Review
								Before I begin it is necessary to reiterate that this game is NOT complete yet. If you don't have the patience to allow the devs time to fix things as they go, don't bother. No one wants to hear you complaining about an unfinished game being unfinished anyways. The vehicles are glitchy, there are some keymapping/control issues though relatively small, the in game mic system is pretty poor, etc. Now, this game is great, but not for the faint of heart. You will die, you will have to start from scratch. This will happen to you over and over and over. The good news is you have a decent amount of permanent storage to save gear, there is now an account leveling system that keeps you from starting completely at 0, and once you get the hang of the game you'll find that leveling and earning gold is relatively easy. As of now the one down side would be staying entertained, the good news is this is one of very few games where you can tell the devs are actually regularly and steadily adding features, fixing bugs, and making the game better. You can group with friends to hunt other members in game (be assured everyone you don't know IS hunting you) it is rare to run across a friendly face outside of a safe zone, but you will learn to be stealthy as well as how to defend yourself quickly. You can battle boss nethers, run packages, fix safe zones, gather gear at loot drops, etc. No playing experience will be the same twice. I highly recommend this game, especially seeing as we have good indicators that this game is only going to get better and better as the devs continue their work!			"

								I'm going to be honest, this game is nothing you havent seen already in games like WarZ, DayZ, among others. So what makes me come back(and you can the time I spent playing it which is something already)? Many things really but If I have to chose only one... I'lll choose pressure. When I enter the game, I feel an incredible amount of pressure, adrenaline, excitement. Why is this? Because these Nether creatures are deadly. These are no zombies which can be killed with a a hit or a shot. You got to be extremely careful and belive me, in this game is very comun to be kill by it's monsters. There are several types of Nether and each one has it's tactics, powers, caracteristics, etc. But this is just one side. On the other one we have the players. Now, this game is full PVP, but I found some conforting in this small comunity. Sure most of the players kill everyone on sight, but in this game, you actually socialize more then I ever did in other games like this. You have groups now which is great, and doing missions with other people is amazing.Now lets talk about the map shall we? It's small. Very small.... for now! For now because we only have access to like 15% off the full map. And the full map looks huge!! hehe. But the fact that the map is small right now, it does not bother me. On the contrary! This is what gives me such excitement! Being in a small map with other players and Nether creatures! And this isnt open land. This is full city! +1 point to the excitement stuff. Everything happens in a city and you have to survive in a city. You don't need to walk 92387592874528518451 miles to meet another player or important locations, you are in the important location. There's no resting, you need to pay attention to everything.We also have diffrent types of missions. Like escorting people, delivering packages to other outposts, repairing the Anti-Nether devices at the lakeside outpost. And I'm sure we are getting more soon! =D My favorite is the package delivery. It's the best way to make money in this game, and I mean ALOT of money if you deliver it in the right place. But this gives me even more adreneline and excitement. It reminds me of the times I played silkroad online back in the day when I did some trades from city to city and you had to hire people(real players) to protect you from thieves(Real players too), and this revival of memories while I'm doing these jobs, it's the cherry on top for me. Has for the developers, I don't know them or anything but with what I've seen so far, I'm really happy with these guys. They are diffrent, they feel diffrent. They listen to the comunity, they make this game better, and they are really quick. I think they are great. If you like what I wrote and are an excitement junckie like meeeaaaii then I would love if you tried this game. You deserve it.If you don't like what I wrote, no worries. I love you anyway and I want you to play this game.If you like this kind of games, what are you waiting for? The next ""walking simulator"" patch? (a.k.a. DayZ)If this is something you never played before, there's always a faaaahhhrrriiisssst timmeeee.If you don't feel or don't like the game, re-read review. Repeat this step if the problem still occurs.If you have no money... hmm...... go work for the local pizzaria and deliver a few pizzas. Perform some kind of minishow to get tips when you deliver it and the go home and buy this one.  "

The visuals are in no way any good, anti-aliasing is definitely lacking, character controls feel very lazy, movement feels lazy, you can't strafe while sprinting, picking stuff up is glitchy, holding e is glitchy, enemies just pop up randomly out of nowhere and kill you.Definitely don't recommend buying this game at all, even at a really low price. 0/10 Don't buy it, ever			"

Some people rate this down simply because people kill you, and that it isn't all friendly and people will kill you on sight.. yeah this happens sometimes but what were you expecting? It's the same as if you buy DayZ or Rust.. it's a survival game - no survival game is fit without PvP providing it's multiplayer.I'd suggest this game to all my friends as I already have done.			"

												I can honestly say I believe this game is a garbage heap.In the early release stages it was good, needed improvement, they started taking it in the right direction and then went SO far off course they crashed off a cliff and now they keep rolling around a mangled carcass hoping to revive it.The player base plummeted / servers died off so fast, going from 50 servers that hold 64 players to maybe 10-15 servers with 10 players (at most) on at any given time.The ""nether"" monsters, teleport and have been given over-powered strength so almost no gun will take them down if you're not level'd up, but how can you do that when everyone is ""seer"" hacking or whatever where they KNOW where you are so they come to kill you.I had a player kill me 4-5 times in a row at various points in the map after respawning while in remotely empty barren locations far far away from the last. Speed hacking is also a huge issue.I can not ever reccomend this game to anyone unless a complete over-haul is done and even then it's  VERY unlikely I'll ever play this again, 0/5 rating to what used to be a 2.5-3 at most in my opinion.

												Not many games do I vote nay on (my first actually...), but the game looks the same as it did in Alpha, yet I guess now is full release?I figured I would check it out as I have not played in a while, was 5 or 6 servers up, all but one (in Europe..) was good for me, the rest I had to buy something more (when I am pretty sure I had to pay for the game itself..though may be mistaken).  So I played for about 10 minutes today.  I got to start in the world instead of town, so didn't have to worry about being killed right out of town by the people that do nothing but camp there all day, so that was a plus.  The world is still extremely empty, I found not 1 item while looking around...and having nothing but a knife grows old when others all seem to have guns..  I still got stuck in a wall, more awesome fun.  Once out in the world I actually saw somebody else runnign a mission I guess.  I went to go after them, had a huge fall into water.  I went for it, survived the jump, then the second I stepped out of the water I died...no clue how.So, while I hate to give a bad mark on something because people put hard work into this stuff (usually), unless they fix some stuff, I do not recommend this game.Peeked back on here since have not checked in a while.  Looks like nothing has been done still.  If you are looking for entertainment are better off buying canned air, turning it upside down and blasting your friends with it.			"

												I bought this game in January of 2014 when it was in open beta. For about a year, it was one of the most entertaining games I had in my library, even if it was buggy as hell. Then, BAM, the creators of the game sold it to a new developer. These new owners released one update that made the game far more ""grindy"" and just an overall less enjoyable experience; after this they didn't update the game at all anymore. Although it used to be a fun and rewarding experience, the game in its current state is not even worth the five dollars.TLDR: Maybe a 3/10			"

												This... is just a huge piece of garbage. I've already got used to play bad games, and some of them are enjoyable: This isn't.My gameplay until now:-Initiated game, created Nether account, launched it.-Got stuck on the menu, Ctrl+Alt-Del and stoped it-Launched it again-Got stuck on the menu, closed it... again.-Launched it once more-Mouse cursor doesn't showed up, had to do Alt-Tab to put it to work-Menu works at 0,2FPS God know why...-Initiated server-Waited 3 minutes, didn't spawned anywhere. Esc, Tab, nothing works, closed game-Launched it-Same process, etc. etc.-FINALLY could play something-Server almost full: can't see no one-Killed some monsters-Got tired of itThat's it. That's what this game is about: kill some monsters, kill some humans, get killed by bothThis game is just an offense to the consumer. In fact, most of Antecipated acess games are. I know that they are not complete yet, but there's no excuse for the lazyness of some projects, and this one is just one of them. The game is completely broken, barely works, and everything in it is terrible. Graphics: 3/10Besides some good details, they are completely uninspired, pop-ups everywhere, textures always show up in front of you, just ugly as ....Gameplay: 2/10Lag. Lag. Lag, so much lag. Most of the actions like crouching, opening the menu, etc, takes seconds, I repeat, seconds to do. Not mili-seconds, not immediately, but 2-3 seconds to do that.The character creating is minimal, you dont have many options.The crafting system is strange and I didn't see any tutorial explaining that.Sound: 1/10Is it there?Final score: 2/10This is a complete garbage, and the least we, players, ask from the creators of games that are in antecipated acess is that they are, at least, functional and works. The game was launched in Fall '13 (almost a Year ago) and it's inadmissible that it's still in this condition, dysfunctional, I'm still looking where can I spend my 50 Gold coisa, because I can't find the store (Yes, I, being a complete idiot, bought the ""Chosen"" edition ((Well, at least it was on Steam Sales, 6€...))There are so many bugs I can't even count anymore, with just 1h of gameplay!!! The game doesn't start, the game doesn't close, the menu freezes, buttons that doesn't work, glitches everywhere, enormous quantity of time required to join a game, so, so many bugs, it's attrocious.So, don't buy this game, at all. Unless a miracle happens, avoid it.			"

												Now that the original creators have control over the game again, I can say it is once again amazing. For me, it's the perfect mix of survival, arcade-y gameplay, and RPG. There's not too much of a survival aspect, but there is a hunger meter that you have to maintain besides health. Guns can be obtained somewhat quickly, but only if you know where to look. This isn't a bad thing for new players though, as it's fun discovering where to find guns (hint: subway!!!) The RPG factor is also amazing, and the perks are pretty fair and really cool. There are also cool late game items like a hang glider to go from building to building. It's also fun with a friend, but I mostly play alone and still have a blast! Overall, I'd definitely reccomend it for the price, and it's a no-brainer when on sale! Also there are NO MORE MICROTRANSACTIONS OF ANY KIND!!!!			"

												I love this game, I really do. It was such a shame that the second dev team ruined the game with a few patches and now all that bad press is falling on the previous dev team, who are now back in control of the games development. Nether's future is definitely looking up, if you're sceptical about that well it's hard to say it could be made worse, currently the game is fun if you find a server to regularly play on, myself I would suggest the feelgood pve and pvp servers, and make some friends to play with. Once mod support is complete hopefully we'll see player made mods fixing the smaller bugs  and issues, as well as adding some more to do in the game, while the Dev team rectify the massive problems caused by the previous devs. It's really a personal choice if you buy this game or not, but don't go into it expecting quality, but don't go into it wanting it to be bad as well, just so because that's what you've been told or heard.

The world is interesting and i like it gives me that i am legend feel or the road feel to it. they have opened it up for modding which is awesome more modes and ideas to pass around. as well all the P2W garbage is gone that i heard about early in the game. It has immense potential i hope they do not squander it all we can do is wait and see i got it on sale and so far its been more that worth it fun game. and i figure i need to mention there are PVE and PVP servers which i like.

												This game, as it currently stands, is a waste of time and money. The monsters are too damn easy to beat when you go one on one but one on five is a bit much. The amount of greifeing jerks on this game is enough to make you sick. The graphics look pretty and very nice but do not let them fool you into thinking that this game is anything like pictures and trailers that it has up. I honestly think that this game has great potential but it needs some drastic changes to its mechanics. Especially colission detection. Oh and not to mention, the leveling system and the scavaging system SUCKS beyond all reason. You die, you go to level 0. WHO THE HELL DOES THAT IN A GAME? The diversity to characters are crappy at best and if you really want to ""have fun"" Then you are urged, like a money drone, to buy the game with the chosen or believer bonuses. Which in my opinion is a grand waste of money that could be spent on games that are being more thuroughly developed. This game feels old and clunky at times. Also, the skeletons and items you find in the game look bigger than any human being I have seen. It is stupid and needs to be fixed. Id recommend that the scavaging system be hammered out to being so much more specific and grandios. Like Rust or The Forest. Perhaps that would make the game that much better.			"

Great FPS, great suspense, great PVP, action around every corner, and, of course, cool guns! But you have to play with friends to get the full enjoyment of it. Give this game a chance. You wont regret it.   Peace Out :)			"

								Do Not Bother.It's just another ""War Z"" the launch was an epic fail which put me off for about a year, I came back to it recently to see not much has changed.There is no Anti-Cheat system which allows players to basically run around speed hacking apparently there is a way to dupe as well since a couple of people had beyond 60k+ of one item.Beyond that there are invisible walls that you have to jump over in the ""Safe Zones"" which is ridiculous after 1 year not to mention there are objects which have no collision so you can literally camp inside an item and nobody would know that you are there.The game is a damn joke there are not many games in my list that I would gladly remove without a refund but this is one of them.

												Well, I feel for it.Back in the day, I saw this game and it's dwindling player base when it was just called Nether. The trailers for the game looked amazing, and the game seemed neat. Micro transactions and three/four versions of the game was a little worrying, but I thought it would've been neat. I didn't get it then. I feel for it when it was renamed Nether Resurrected.All that happened is the devs renamed themselves (more or less) and renamed the game to make it seem like something new was happening. This change caused some people, such as myself, to finally spend money on the game and play it, and, to my suprise, it was an unoptimzed, unpopulated, ""wtf is happening?"" fest.The textures look horrible.The game runs horribly.There was no one playing.The monster AI was laughable.I've only played for 3 hours because that's all I could play with any multiplayer server. I still download the game every other month for a few minutes just to see what has happened with it, and the game has become even worse than when there was micro transactions in it.While this game is horrible, I will share one good experience I had with it: While going about the main safezone, I bump into another player, which was a rarity, and we eyeball one another for a while before a notification popped up saying the safezone was being invaded. Quickly, I gave him a gun I found and we waited those 5 minutes before the monsters started spawning everywhere. Over the course of 10 minutes we killed every monster that spawned in the safezone, and then when it was done, that was it. I let him keep the gun, and he left the safezone while tried to figure out how to sell some items i found whilst exploring.Was this one, 20 minute long, player interaction and world event worth any money?NoHonestly, I have had more fun meeting randoms in ArmA 2 DayZ mod, where people shoot on sight almost always, and ArmA 3 DayZ mod, where people may shoot you depending on their class.Hell, I've had more fun with the unoptimized DayZ standalone and all of it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.This game is not worth any money, and I would not even recommend poking at it with a 10 foot stick. You're $5 would be put more to use by burning it than wasting it on this game.			"

								This game is worth the money you spend on it. There are some concerns I have for this game however. I personally think it could do without the safezones, and the shops. I think it needs to incorporate some things such as basebuilding and better working vehicles, and a large portion of the map is still needed. But most of this stuff will come in due time. But all in all I do recommend this game, it has greater potential than some people give credit for.			"

Nah let me continue as with Rust this game suffers from a community full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that camp the so ironically called ""Safe Zones"". I vote no just because the ""Safe"" zones are in the end where you have to be to trade and sell items, or hell acess the stupid ""Global Inventory"" system or get missions from the AI, or hell meet a friend, but all of this is (in my case litterally) blown out of the sky (long story short I had a hang glider and the ""Safe Zone"" was in the tallest building in my area)			"

								Honestly speaking when this game came out i was exicited and could not wait for it. Spent close to $20 for this game and the minute i played i hated it. lets look at the plus points first :1. Scary music2. general feel of survival 3. fresh take on aliens(asides from the boring zombie thing)4. map detailshowever the down side to this game is that there is not a save button where it lets you save your character level once you die(which is a lot), so as soon as you die, not only will you lose all your items, but become a level 1 ASAP. this kind of thing makes the player fed up, if he is a level 10 and above. furthermore to get items is somewhat hard and often leaves you without food and dying because of that. it also starts you out with a kitchen knife which means you have to work your way up. This game had potential but was led down the minute you played it. they should make sure that when you die your level remains and not reset to 1, they should make sure the items spawn faster, also should give good tutorials as you are literally thrown into the map and have to fend for yourself. another thing is they should give an Nether list of aliens of what to do and donts for it. but honestly until they do something about the game, its a no no indeed			"

												This is my short and sweet look on the game Nether. Its a very nice game with a chance to meet new friends and have a thrill in the game. Nether is still a little undeveloped but I have faith in the developers in updating the game as time goes on. A game is a game where yu play it and you either enjoy it or not, I enjoy it. Its full of new thrills and exciting places to explore along with the challenge to survive against the monsters that come from the depths of Hell and the other players that are out to get you. Yes the game does have a few bugs but are currently being fixed on. For example, there used to be a large amount of ESP hackers giving some players the ability to obtain aimbot, teleport, invinsability, duplication, speed, and many more. The game was updated where the hackers were banned. Now half of the players that used to play (hacked) are now banned and the game is a lot more fun to play. I love to get on the game now and have fun with my tribe and friends. I recomend this game to anyone who is new to apocoliptic games. Its worth the $10!			"

								Fails to advertise game mechanics on the store page. This game is a perma-death game. It features a levelling system that is completely pointless due to the fact as soon as you die you lose all your progress, whether that be days, weeks, or months.Unfortunately the steam store fails to mention any of this and simply titles it a ""Survival FPS"" game. I wish I hadn't wasted my money. Don't make the same mistake I did.			"

You will easily get your money's worth but be careful as everyone kills on sight. There are no friendlies, this is a PVP arena.Update: 18/12/2015This game is back and it's as great as it used to be. It's excellent to see the developers continuing to support the game and to see that a playerbase still exists.			"

								Bought game based on reviews and a few other things, but wow, i know the game is in development but i think i made a mistake. The nethers can pop up and warp around you, and im not the best or the worst shot but everytime i would shoot he would warp and appear some place else, so bullets seemed worthless against the nethers.My first log in, i seen 45 people die within the 1st hour, to me that just seems like they needed to adjust a few things.I honestly havent went back to the game since it was first released so it may be better now, but it will take some serious changes to make me want to play the game ever again.

								If you enjoy a game where you stand no chance of survival unless you meet no human interaction then this gmae is deffinately for you. This game would be great if there was more PvE and a littel bit less PvP. See everyone in this game seems to think it is all about kill on sight and kill everyone on sight no matter who they are what they have or what they even know. Dont plan on lasting mroe than 5 minutes alive in the game or finding anyone to help you learn the controls or the mechanics and aspects. I have not run across many friendly helpful people and the few that i have are jsut so littel ammount they dont outweight the ammount fo player killing rude ones. If you enjoy a game where it is a real challenge to survive and fight against otehr but the elements cause no means of worry, this game might appeal to you. But if your looking for a Multiplayer RPG Survival game like the Genre is said to be this is not simply the case. A littel more PvE elements would be appreciated. Maybe even server options to turn off PvP. Or make there be less of a reward or even a penalty. I beleive it was meant to have a PvP element but not to the extent of not being able to trust anyone and being sniped the second you leave a safe zone.			"

												Well 30 mins in, died 3 times, its a fairly ok environment with safezones which you can spawn in with a machette, missions which spawn occasionally. A map with locations which you can waypoint to, to take on missions. Bugs, and monsters, 'nethers' for you to fight off with your butter knife ... an ultimately death .,.. Its a game which you learn through death ... i was losing interest due to the lack of scavenging ... i've looked everywhere and found squat.. on a server... not even an old gun without amo, a tin of beans. But when i played singleplayer I lucked out and found some good weapons fast, so there are probably different drop rates / settings between servers. There's a few servers, with a few people on them so its ok, i was thinking for the price to lan play it if nothing else ... Scavenging is hard and realistic.... The more you put into this game, the more you get out of it. For a buck worth a try i guess... and its just a case of learning the actual gameplay mechanics before losing interest.... then there is tons of content, just not some of the mechanics im used to being a 1000 hour arma 2 dayz vet. There is a single player campagn as well, you will find it at the top of the server list. Works ok, found Nether hoard almost straight away which was fun. Just played it again, quickly found a 'surging' hoard of Nether's ... when they surge .. its like they teleport in right next to you ... the fighting is realistic with realistic damage inflicted and recieved. Over time my health recovered. Killed a couple ... also found a bunch of weapons at the top of a building, in some metal crates ... Its panning out to be a lot of fun. will update as i put time in, but for a buck or even $5 not on sale its not a bad deal really			"

 I don't really recommend this game to everybody. Because this game are same as WarZ. I was find disguise that player keep killing other player but not to Nether, but they will kill Nether when it need for team up to secure Safe Zone, then after this. They pretend to friendly won't harm. When you exit BAM. Yeah see that's sux. People complain and told them go play somewhere else, that's very rude and not seem motivation to play together. Why waste your money for 30.00. Trust me you will thank me later. I do recommend when Nether goes to 2.50$ or 5.00$ on sale and play it and you will understand why.  I am deaf, other player use mic to speak to other player to alert before presence, but if no reponse then they will think they ignore and possible threat to them that they may shoot them. So they had to shoot that person before it had back.  It sick. Developer not listen to their feedback about to have PVE server so they have enjoy to explore and team up with other kill Nether to survive. So they choose not to have the player to enjoy their game product.  Grade: F **UPDATE** Grade: BI will update this recommend when they FIX.**Update**As previous comment I made was causing me upset, I step back and waitfew days and then I return to game, I met a awesome player that helpe me alot! When I got overcrowd by nether and other player saw me and gather my stuff and told me to meet up to return it to me. I was surprise that, I say sure, thank you very much. (I was very happy) We meet up and got stuff back and give me bonus items. I stock up inventory and team up together explore and slay nethers. way much funs and we meet other player and become 2 then 4 then 6. Awesome. From my understand if you know your friends or to be happen meet in game was trying friendly to help. You earn their trust and play together. But if you don't know them, good luck it kill each other. Some of us want friendly unless if they hurt one of us, it will be avenge. :-)I give this Grade B this time for now. I am much relief, thank you for changing my mind and heart. If you see this during winter sales. Try get this and shout us and we can team up!Enjoy!			"

								If you like suvival games/action games then this one's worth checking out.

Though it's a work in progress, and its not fair to review something that isn't even finished because everything could change, I think that this game is going to be DayZ's #1 contender for its genre.

								Nether, Some people like this game some people won't. I personally ♥♥♥♥ing love it! The best way to describe this game is. I more polished DayZ but less fetures. I actually prefer this game over DayZ and I will continue too, The reasoning for this is because in DayZ walking is pretty boring....It takes long and there is no vehicales (yet) and the scenery in DayZ is meh. But then you play Nether and there are vehicles and the game is beatiful so you don't mind walking across the ♥♥♥♥ing map, but then you do. and not because its boring but because of, well the Nether! Unlike DayZ in this game the enemies are well done. In DayZ enemies run through walls, they can be out ran very fast, and pretty much usless, I can honestly say ive never really been screwed over by a zombie aside from once....and my legs were broken so yeah, Then when it comes to the enemies (nethers) in this game you ♥♥♥♥ing are crouchiong and trying to avoid them and if you see a certain type that looks to big and stuff you like completley change your route just to avoid it. I say get this game. Final Verdict: I say get this game! Please put the time into it though, once your about 1 hour in you start learning how to loot better and how to avoid creatures. I love this game, and you can too. P.S all the bad reviews are mostly by people who have only played .8 hours on it. So ♥♥♥♥ing play more then 1 hour on a game that is EARLY ACCESS before reviewing it like a♥♥♥♥♥♥ BYYYYEEEE!			"

								You´ll die, you´ll die and you´ll die again. Nether is all about trying to stay alive only to find out you fail in this quest eventually. Nethers can be avoided or killed - it´s the trickery of human mind that will snipe you down from a far, or hunt you down with a machine gun against your crowbar. It´s not bad, though, but the amount of your frustration will grow as you´ll progress with your character, gathering supplies, med kits, weapons and money, and suddenly you find yourself dead, not even knowing what put an end to your survival. This is not a TV show and you´re not a main protagonist - it´s harsh, it´s dangeours, but fun, if you´re that type of player. If not, you´ll turn this game off as soon as you die third time. Good thing is that noone can take away from you your account progress, and with playing the game you get various bonuses that are bound not to your character, but account as a whole. Graphics could be better and various customization of shadows, lighting or ambient occlusion are, in fact, useless. It´s the resolution and texture details what matters. Still, playing this game on 1600x900 with high details on 3 years old notebook graphics is a decent performance. In a cube: Nether is not a bad game, but not made for all kind of players, though. Fans of DayZ, horror and survival titles might be pleasantly surprised, others... frustrated.			"

												Nether is a awesome and fantastic world you can feel the environment and have a sense of feeling of being alone but you can just sense the enemy player or nether around the corner as you attempt to survive in this immerse world and helping your tribe expand like the roman empire and gain in wealth but at the same time other tribes try to take that away from you as you grow and to fight at the teeth of your enemies defenses and to claim victory is always satisfying even if its just a fight in the alley and fight the nether will be a living hell your a walk in the park as you gain a understanding of the world and why it is this way as you either live as kings or die trying as you scavenging your way to the top taking your foes with you for your people so they can progress farther as you lie bleeding to death as you feel every inch of your life slipping away from you as all you worked for escapes from you in a second as the PVP and PVE gameplay is unique in its own way as the community come together on PVE but if you want the true and classic feeling of nether and feeling any second you will be hunted down and executed or to be eaten alive then PVP is for you but over all the game is a master piece in its own way but that is dependent on the players play style and if they are willing to discover and be dedicated to this world in a way or another as you will realizes how truly fun Nether is as you can play alone or with friends or find new friends in the safe zone but as you will learn quickly no where is safe as you explore Nether.

								While Nether leaves much to desire in regards to solid world objects, that you can now walk through here, and the problem of cheaters and hackers, I find this an admirable game, due to the setting, environment and enemies. This game puts me more on edge than DayZ, and the player issue is much, much more in DayZ, than Nether.Regardless of the Cheaters, and non-solid objects, I find this a very good game, due to its mechanics, weapons and interaction with the world.Highly recommended.

												Only recomended for the ease of hacking if you wanna see what hackings like this is the game to do it in.....its vac does not even work properly free running of cheat engine makes this game the biggest hacker joke ive played since MW2.....and even then managed to get caught by vac in ~2 weeks......been 3 months strong here and nothing lol multiple videos id easily say 100-200 reports. The dev team for this game pawned the game off on some other saps who apparently nether read reviews.......every patch is 900mb easy that has more then 3 words fixed in a warning. If steam restarts all the servers crap out and you cant connect untill they put the gerbil back on the wheel. Game was rushed crafting is garbage new area is crap.....and were out of early access.......there was god mode while prone...lasted almost a week. There is a run glitch that will keep you moving forward was fixed once but its back. Game was good in December-January after that it got bad fast.			"

												I do not see the problem people are having with this game. The community will slaughter you at first sight, yes. But if you actually ask around you'll see  that there are a few people who'll help you.I'll describe the joy I've had with this game in the 4 hours I've played:I joined a EU-West server, and to my suprise people were actually typing in ENGLISH. DECENT ENGLISH (I shouldn't even complain, my grammar is wayyyy off the map).Surely did I  taste the wrath of veterans killing me and I'll admit it, I wanted to quit the game so hard. But I stayed, which I'm glad I did.After that I ended up socialising with a few of the guys which instantly made me a friendly target. No ONE, and I repeat, NO ONE was even trying to kill me after I explained that I was just a new player wanting to learn the game.I ended up becomming friends with a player called W4R which took his time to give me resources and show me a few tricks.This proved to me that the community is actually what YOU choose it to be. If you decide not to talk with your fellow players they'll surely see you as a potential danger. But if you actually take your time to ask them questions and such they'll just see you as a friendly guy trying to learn the game.Sadly, there were still some people which acussed skilled players of being hackers. Which they obviously weren't.I'll rate the community with 7/10. There's still work to be done.Now, for the actualy gameplay... Oh god. I love that you've tried but come on developers... These monsters are just plain boring and will go down extremly easily. And all of them being able to teleport is just...No.Fighting enemies that constatly teleport around you is EXTREMLY STUPID AND BORING. We want something better! Something that will stand still and take a beating like he's supposed to while still trying to kick my god damn♥♥♥♥♥  So if you're a fan of PVE, then don't buy this game.Don't even consider it.Now, when it comes to PVP... You'll find yourself in TONS of battles.  You can either go lone-wolf and decide to snipe the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everyone you see or you could start a gang and have a gang war.Make people take off their clothes for you! Make them drom you their items and then execute them! You've got so many opportunities! ( Please do not do this to new players)Bugs. Oh boy does this game have bugs...Oh boyyyyy. Do not buy this game if you can't stand having to jump 50 times to get over an obstacle. Do not buy this game if you're a boring person not willing to see the fun in being able to walk through crates. This game is EXTREMLY buggy. But don't let that scare you, because these bugs WILL all get fixed and right now they're just making the game funnier. It's something you can relay on when you've just been chased by a gang for 2 hours. It will make your day.Gameplay: 7/10.This game has still got so MUCH to fix. But that's what I like. Because I feel like I'm part of it and able to change stuff together with the rest of the community.  So if you want to play a survival game alone/with your friends that you'll surely enjoy... Then this is the one. Overall: 8/10Don't just believe those short negative reviews...Try the game. It's awesome.P.S: Whoever said this was P2W...Did you actually play the game? "

A really good option would be a refresh list button as well as a dropdown to select what region's servers you would like to look at.Original post June 2014 ^^^Edit : June 2015 -This game has been untouched for 4 months now and nothing really changed with the last few updates.

								Well besides being killed on sight by other players, seeing a few hackers and dealing with trolls within the first hour of playing, It's a decent game. It is pretty intense at times, decent amount of jump scares, which makes it all that much better. Most players are friendly and help you out, but most of my experience has been with inconsiderate people, who kill you because they want your katana for money. But all in all, a pretty good survival game, definitelty can't wait for the final product.			"

								This game is a mixture of Fear, Terror, Anxiety, Confusion, Conflict, Tough Decisions, and a neverending sense of DANGER all wrapped up in a post-apocalyptic world where you are one of the survivors. If you love horror survival games, then this is the game for you. It's addicting and is insanely fun. Of course, this game isn't quite finished so there are a couple of things that will irritate you (mine was getting dying in one hit to a crawler, one of the lower level mosters int he game). But if you look passed the minor flaws, you'll find a fantastic game.			"

								**** DISCLAIMER - Yes I know this is an alpha game and I am a terri-bad player!! Also I get a little long winded in spots! If your attention span can't handle it, don't read!! Hopefully this will help people deciding on buying the game. Number ratings are at the bottom after my long winded parts ;-) ******""A DAYZ Killer"" they said in the banner... well as much as I love DAYZ, I had to go research. A survival game the research showed! In a sprawling urban environment with tribes working to capture and hold parts of the city. Ok, so it looked like a more robust end game style, perfect! The videos and screens were of some sort of monsters that I could only guess were mutated zombies of some sort. Well... that'll teach me to do dive too quickly and not read further...So I bought the game. First load in showed the city to be beautiful. A stark setting under a dark sky with strange sounds all around. I hestitantly walked forward 30 feet... bam... dead. Oh it looks like another survivor in this sprawling expanse found me and wanted my butter knife. Ok no prob... respawn... get two blocks and find an axe!! Perfect that wil... bam... dead from behind. Oh... ok. Respawn in the world... 1 minute later... bam... They sure do want their butter knives in this city. Ok so I will respawn in a ""safezone"". Spawn in... bam bam bam! Oh good, a tribe is camping the safezone during an event where the safezones are not...safezones. Ooookay.... So began the frustration. I did like the character leveling tree, but it's gone as soon as you get killed. Items seem cheesy when you run into them. If you have ever played DAYZ or few of the mods you'll see what I mean. Let me stand perfectly still while I hold the ""E"" button down to spend four seconds of actual time to pickup a... soda. That doesn't expose me at all in this ""survival game"". And now the creatures... horrifying... kind of. Relatable? No... Sci-fi-ish? Yes... And that is how this game should have been marketed. They should have never mentioned DAYZ except for purely the money grab to get people all excited to buy it. The creatures are fairly decent models and have great sounds. They also teleport... yup that is right. Flashy light, poof, they are behind you, to your side, etc etc. In a first person game, that makes them a pretty decent threat. Ok... so I am new spawn with a butter knife, I know I can't take on some of these things. I'll run! The game does have a cool stamina bar that as you level your character (don't get killed!), can be beefed up. Problem... the creatures don't need to run. They watch you run like a fool, teleport to you and swing. Ouch... you keep running, they teleport again, poof, swing aaaaand your dead. And I tested it... it doesn't matter if you jump over things, try to lose them in a building, etc. They WILL find you. So that means no running. Ok I will swing with them with my butter knife! Boom health points start to drop on you rapidly. One or two confrontations and you are smoked. Creature mechanics... ='s bad.... especially when players are taking you out with a few swings of their melee weapons.In game stores... this is kind of neat. An end of the world shop area where people trade you for things you find. Cigarettes etc. This makes it so you can get currency that allows you to buy a little better gear. Just don't get caught here when the safezone nether devices fail. Tribes camp people here... not creatures... why? Darned if I know...In short folks, if you are COD/Battlefielder where you shoot everything on site, this may be a slight distraction.So 6 hours later... here is the first impressionSo for the scales: 1 worst, 10 bestCharacter Control: 7 (I liked the jumping, was fairly smooth, but dropped it a point due to not being able to side step when sprinting)Weapons: 7 (when you can get them, they are fairly cool)Graphics: 7 (dropped this due to the item graphics and flashing, makes for no real searching like in other games. Just run around looking for the flashes/glowing to find things to search)Creature/NPC: 6 (superbad mechanics for newbies - other players are bad enough to deal with)Leveling: 7 (I liked the idea of the tree leveling - but it lost it's flair when I realized how fast you lose it)Crafting: 5 (interestingly enough you find pieces of things to piece together back at the safe zone. But holy heck... give me a weapon I can actually use seeing as a person can get killed every minute by creatures or players. Pick a low pop server at first folks if you want even a chance of trying this out!)UI: 5 (rudimentary UI, with a decent map waypoint system. Horrible settings/config. It doesn't even show all the key bindings but will holler at you if you try to remap something that is already bound)Ingame Chat/Voice: 4 (I never found a way to have a local/area chat so anything you say goes straight to global/largescale area. Better not plan a tribe take over in that! The voice chat was fairly horrible the few seconds I heard someone try it.)Community: 1 (yup a 1... better bring some friends if you are serious about trying this)Clan/Tribe Activity: 4 (you can take over area's of the city. I went to area's that said they were unclaimed and was told that I had to stand in a certain area for five minutes. Supposedly a bar would come up that showed my progress. Again, with no basic level info, I went out to forums to find out just this information. No one would say in global or chat. I never did get to claim any area's. Perhaps you have to be a clan, but I never really got to talk to anyone in an attempt to join one. Pretty much anyone that I saw coming, was filling me and my butter knife full of lead...)Grouping/In game event: 6  (I saw some people talking in global chat, and they went and secured some type of objective. It reminded me a little of Defiance and Rift in that aspect. The problem comes from people also going there to shoot you as you try to complete said objectives.)PvP: 8 (If you like the COD/Battlefield style play with a little sci-fi-ish NPC's thrown in, you might like this)Survival Aspect: 4 (The emphasis on this game is killing creatures and players. It feels like the food meter is an after-thought, that adds one more thing in the game that can kill you. Trust me, unless you bring a posse', this will never be a real problem for you. If you come into this game expecting the feel of DAYZ SA, you will not find that here. This survival is based against other players and the creatures which makes it feel just like another CoD/BF4ish game. It's a run and gun... or butter knife...)Storyline: 5 (rudimentary tutorial missions when you first start - IF you can finish them. No over all arching story missions or quests. You have no idea why you are running around trying to kill people other than to just take their stuff)Overall rating: 4.93  (I may try to play it another hour so that I feel I haven't completely wasted my 14.99... but I am not sure if I can bring myself too)			"

												This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥.. I cry for my $6 back :( The server selection screen loads SOOOO S L O W if it loads at all. When you do manage to get into game theres nothing to do. The safe zone is comprimised and crawling with nethers. You cant even turn in the tutorial mission.  WHAT THE F@#!. I wouldnt recommend this game to my worst enemy. Ive had cancer and that was more exciting than this piece.Oddly enough I keep trying to beat the server selection screen boss... strange.			"

												Where do I start... If you're one of the lucky ones, you will be able to buy the game, launch it, and be able to play immediately. (Don't count on it...) I had to throw out SOS to Steam/Nether for their gut-wrenchingly poor support for Steam-Nether account synchonization.Game play, game play... It feels like a really *really* poorly done mod for Fallout or Skyrim... E.G. Guns have incredibly boring accuracy mechanics, and melee combat feels like a mod went poorly, and abandoned by the modder -- out of shame.About 20%~25% of my time is time spent stuck *inside the environment*... Inconspicous walls seem to like to grab characters, and never let them go. Not to mention the half dozen areas that should be ""inaccessible"" to players, having no real way out... Other than to starve to death, or get mauled by monsters... Which, by the way, means you lose all your stuff (with no chance of getting them back, lest you get stuck in the inaccessible area again...)The monsters... Probably some of the most, grotesquely boring enemies I've ever experienced in any format of FPS... Probably equipped with the most tragic sense of AI that's ever disgraced the visage of mankind, with even a speck of paying attention you should be able to tell exactly where the monster is going, and what attack it's going to do LOOOONG before it'll touch you.Player VS. Environment VS. PlayerGreat concept on paper, but when applied... You only get players who rally up, and camp the buildings and kill you on a whim... Which is totally popular, and legitimate tactic for PVP games... But but for an adventure/survival/exploration/PVP -- it's just a really poorly mish-mash of concepts that are easily dismissed to make it into an entirely PVP game, with basically less-than-spectacular weapon and combat mechanics.Occasionally character stops sprinting, mid-sprint... Standing there as an open target for whatever nasty beast is drooling after you, or player is trying to kill you.I made a point to test my theories in PVE, and successfully killed every monster the game had to offer with the basic starter knife... No. I am not a pro at this game, no it was not epic, it was all actually really depressing, and disappointing...So... With pathetically done environment, extremely lack-luster PVP, monsters that make Rust Bears/Wolves look like IQ-Over-9000 (minus erratic teleporting, which is still quite unimpressive...) and well. All-around lack of content and an otherwise undesirable atmosphere for a game... Not to mention the HUD/social/communications in this game is just... Atrocious...The character customization offers a massive variety of everything between Vanilla, to... Well. Vanilla.   If you spend money, you might get a single M&M to put on top of it... But they will only provide the color/flavor you don't like.This isn't even half of the stuff I want to say about this game... But I think the point has been made.Buy something else...Play something else...Don't waste your time on this like I did.			"

												Go spend your hard earned money on anything else but this.   I thought it was worth the risk for a very reasonable price and bought it during the summer sale.  First, making an account was attrocious work, due to NOT recieving any validation email, no matter how many times I attempted to make their ""website"" do so with the ""verify"" button in your account settings. Strangely I was able to start the game without a verification email... ok, strange.   When the client starts, you are not greeted with a title screen, or any kind of story... no.  You are greeted with a server screen that takes about 5 minutes to load until you can do ANYTHING! No, I am not exagerating, this server screen takes your mouse icon as a hostage until it is done loading so you cannot even close the game if you want to.  Finally! I select a server and in I go right?  I get to select a character, spawn, check my graphic settings, maybe I might actually SEE some of the game... right?  Nope!  The game shows you a big middle finger by spawning you somewhere on the map in spectator mode, WITHOUT the ability to open the options menu to check your graphics, or even CHAT with the populous already playing the game.  This leaves you with your only option of flying around as a disembodied entity watching the world around you just.... be there.  Angrily I decide to end the game.... but how?  The options menu doesnt even pop up! The game took my options menu hostage!  Alright, so I have to resort to some brute force and just close the game using the task manager to get back to windows.  But I still want to actually TRY this game I payed for, in order to form an opinion right?  Ok, I am fair, maybe this is still in Beta testing (though it is NOT in any way mentioned when you buy it in Steam that this is the case), and maybe it is a bug.  I write an email to the support and explain the situation.  One day later, I look in my mailbox and only get an email that says ""thank you for purchasing the game!"".  If YOU have better things to do with your time then to let this poorly developed skeleton of a software gnaw at your sanity, then spend a couple bucks more and buy ANYTHING else, and enjoy THAT instead!

												Bought the game during the Steam Summer sale?Well, prepare.Don't Click or do anything when you log into the game. Don't even breath. Or blink. Just do nothing. For about 2 minutes. You should be able to select a server then.First 15 Minutes of Nether:Ok, I have to head to the Safezone to deliever a package. Let's do this!Hey nice, a Shovel. Better pick that up. I should equip it too. It does 20 more dmg than my small knive and more range is always good.After like 13 Minutes I'm near the Safezone. My Character gets hungry, I see a gasstation...yeah they could have some food.Oh look, another player. My first encounter in Nether. This is exciting. Wow he even has a shotgun...BAMM.Hey, look, I can watch this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ collect all the stuff I collected thus far. Thanks dude, I guess Nether now has another Player that will scout near Safezones to kill new Players armed with a Shovel with my Shotgun just to collect some loot I prolly won't even need.See you near a Safezone.And, before I forget:Welcome to Nether			"

								This is probably the best survival MMO I have ever played. The game itself is still a bit buggy, the collisions are kind of awkward, but I hope that'll get fixed when the game is out of beta and actually released. The action is so intense and the interaction with other players will make you so paranoid that you become afraid for everyone, driving you into a killing frenzy (in game, that is).Awsome game, 8/10, just because of the bugs, otherwise, perfect!

								Bought this game did not play for a couple of months  cos i thought it would be an♥♥♥♥♥kicken pvp wise, ruthless i played dayz for a while but the PVP was too harsh for my book this game skirts the edge of that although at first you`ll get taken out by players alot at first it should not take you too long to learn the enviroment and how you can use it to your advantage, me personaly i`ll wait for the trouble to die down then continue the mission. The fighting with the nether is really responsive and their teleportation just keeps you on your toes i find melee is the best course of action hell yeah you could shoot em but the noise! even in the underground it`s dangerous to run just in case they here you from above.Atmosphere is amazing audio and visual its one of those game where you`ll turn up the volume so you can hear whats on the other side of the wall wether it be nether or player. Im having alot of fun (frustration at times) with this game Well Impressed :)			"

												Reasons not to buy it:1. No goal. None you just run around and ""survive"". No endgame.2. No reason to work to together. No matter what you do you can still hurt you buddies so goodbye trusting anyone.3. Everyone is just out to kill each other. Just a glorified deathmatch.4. Every enemy teleports, goodbye running away if you know you can't win.5. The enemies are laughably easy unless encountered in hoards.6. They just shoved it out the door despite its full of bugs.7. Terrain is horribly glitched I've falling out of the map multiple times, got stuck multiple times, and hell just walked under the map, multiple times. Water is just a joke either it'll kill you insanely fast 'cause you get stuck or just straight up instant kill you.Do NOT buy this game, it's just a pvp mess and doesn't deserve your time what so ever. If you want a pvp game try counter strike, TF2, hell even COD would be a better choice than this. This is just scam city hell there is even rumors floating around that this is made by the same people that made WarZ (know as infestation now)			"

												The nether is a horrible game, do not waste any of your hard monney on this piece of sh*t the developers call a ""game"" it wasted my time making some new nether account for a game in which i cannot connect to ther servers , and when i want to exit i have to restart my computer also it messed up my FPS counter and it recorded that i was getting 300000+FPS. I didnt even know it went that high let alone the fact that it is possible. From what i have seen and read, these servers are dominated but paid users on a game in which i paid for in the first place. I have seen videos in which the player spawns walks around and ether gets total demolished by an over 9000 paid user or some horific creature that suddenly erupts from the ground.

												Don't get this game, just don't. I put it on my wishlist hoping it would eventually go from alpha to beta then full game where I'd eventually buy it (I'm not paying full price for a half finished game). Then the Summer sale comes along and nether drops to $2.99 and there is no sign of an alpha or even a beta tag on their main page, an obvious trick to get people to purchase a game that is clearly not ready, but forget about that nonsense. Here we go on an adventure! Time to make my character, wow there really seem to be a lot of choices, or atleast there would be if you want to spend more real world money to unlock anything other than a red shirt and khakis. Oh well, pick one of three hairless heads and lets be on our way! Spawn in a safezone, that sounds like the best idea, as I have no idea what I'm doing yet. Cool there's other people here too! Heh that's awkward those to guys look a lot alike....and I guess I also look just the same, I knew I should have picked the black guy head. Ok well, lets start playing the game. Don't let the name safezone fool you for it's actually the most dangerous part of the whole map! Make sure to find and turn on the anti nether devices! What's that you say? You just started and we haven't told you about the anti nether devices protecting the safezone? Well it's too late for that! There's nowhere to hide as monsters swoop in and teleport all around as you flail helplessly and die as the faint sound of a toilet flushing hits the back of your mind and you think of all the other ways you could have spent your money. Spawn again and this time I'm Super far away from the safezone. Well if that was the safezone I'd hate to see what it's like out here and with the sun going down no less, I'm sure nothing creepy is going to happen after dark. Turns out that's just the case as nothing attacks me as I walk through empty building after empty building with not even a pile of trash to search through, when finally I spot a glowing box that I can finally search. What's that? It should open an inventory window once you've searched it to grab the items like every game has been doing since the dawn of time? F*** that we're going to randomly throw it on the ground next to the pile so you can search that pile. A can of beans and a shotgun barrel! The gods have surely smiled on me this day! I am indeed  hungry as I eat the can of beans and begin the rest of the walk towards the safezone where i can find the local purveyor of fine goods and maybe sell it for more beans. No more than halfway down the block and I'm hungry again and starving to death. I reach the safezone exhausted as I run up to the store shotgun barrel in my hand as I dream of beans, but when I interact with the vendor apparently he'll only buy the shotgun barrel if I have other random stuff with it. ""What an odd fellow!"" I think as my lifeless body hits the floor dead from starvation only 10 minutes out from downing a whole can of beans. Cool! Well I'll respawn just in time to see my fellow survivors allready cleaning my corpse of all his valuables. Back to square one. Look at how much fun we're having!Problems:   Non-safe, safezones   Nothing to do other than walk packages back and forth between ""safezones""   Nothing to do out in the wasteland but scavenge the 3 lootable items on the whole island   Monsters teleport behind you as soon as you try to attack and grab you from behind and then repeat   My gear doesn't save even if I log out, instead of dying, ensuring that I never make any progress    Tutorial?   Wierd system to buy and sell goods.   Everything elseCalling this game an alpha build is an insult to every alpha that's ever existed and not labeling it as an unfinshed game on you page is downright underhanded. I really do want to see this game succeed as it has good concepts in place, but it is just so far from the end product that they promise that it'll be a long time before you see anything worth it on this game. Check back in a year maybe it'll be worth a buy.			"

Welcome to Nether, where 50% of your gameplay will be: stuck in spectator mode...and there's no way to get out. And even if you are lucky enough to actually get the game to work, there are so many things to ruin your fun such as: game freezes, a bad spawning point, hackers (despite the fact you can go to a secure server), random attacks by swarms of nether...and much more ways for the game to troll you.Honestly the creaters of Nether should have put more time into the game, because 50% of the time when you join a server, you are stuck in spectator mode. I know, I know ""you just have to wait for a bit"" well I don't like to ♥♥♥♥ing wait. I want to pick up the game, and ♥♥♥♥ing play it. I don't want to wait 10 minutes+ just to spawn in the world.Not to mention the headache it was just to get a create a Nether account, connect my Steam account to a Mber account, and actually connect to the damn servers, only to be returned to the server menu. Don't buy this game, until the developers actually get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and fix all these bugs, don't ♥♥♥♥ing buy this.			"

												launching the game is painfully slow. takes a good 20 minutes to get into a server and start playing the game. Sometimes after the 20 minute wait you spawn as a flying camra and have to Ctrl Alt Del just to restart the game.			"

												How can a great concept turn bad you wonder? Having just started to explore the surrounding area and picking up a bunch of nice goodies to craft, my life was cut short...killed in cold blood by a human player. Now yes this is awesome if you are the one doing the shooting, but if you happened to be the poor fool on the recieving end of that bullet...it gets to be a little annoying. there should be pvp and pve servers to disallow this kind of thing as an option. The game itself was fun and it is a little buggy but you can easily see past that but this just isnt what I thought it would be. good luck to you...you will need it!			"

												I played a lot of this game early access. Even with it being full of hackers it was more fun than it is now. The game has no more loot drops and forces you to pay real money for keys. You're no longer able to grind for gear. Trying to make a buck in time for the summer Steam sale they put their game at $3 to lure new players. Those people soon realised it was a waste of money and now the servers are low population again. Unless you're part of a big in-game clan for help and are hardcore about this game playing over 200+hrs (I have a friend who has over 1,000 hrs of gameplay) don't waste your time. Everything that was promised by the devs have fallen short.			"

												First review and it's a negative one.I hate to put a game down so badly, but come on.This game is such a joke. I'm glad I only paid $3 for it.It looks nice and all, but the coding is horrible.I soon as I spawned into the open world I couldwalk through half the fences and poles around me.You can crawl through boxes and some walls ""partially"".I could understand if this game had just came out, butI've had my eye on it for a while. To me I agree that thisis just another cash grab game. Otherwise they wouldbe fixing the main bugs first. Come on collision detectionshould be the first thing you fix before you go on to doother things.Ok sorry for wasting your time. Like this game wasted mine.			"

												Disenfranchised players, hackers galore, and a distant development crew who do not listen to their player base. Welcome to nether where 5 hours of hard work can be wiped out completely by one cheater with godmode and aimbot. Do the developers care? Read their updates and ""news"" posts. Any mention of cracking down on cheating programs, activating an anti-cheat program, anything to stop that? Nope. next lets talk about game play and plot. Gameplay is ok in the sense that you can run around pretty much willy-nilly without worrying too much. The in game ""nethers"" will spawn weak and ultra-strong versions with no consideration for player level (+1 for zombie apocolypse realism). They will spawn in your spawn points after you die, they invade the ""safe zones"" and kill you there, only to have you respawn halfway across the map so that by the time you get back to your body it has already been looted or decayed (You will really needs some good friends to play with you if you want to keep your stuff after death). And all that experience and character boosting you did? Forget about it, it is gone. Next, if you want the really good stuff in the game, be ready to shell out some real money. Because it only spawns in locked containers that you have to buy keys for with cold hard real world cash. And even then you aren't garanteed anything worthwhile. Finally plot. Nothing there. Nada. Zilch. Zippo. Quests primarily involve ""Run this package there"" or ""Get these different items and come back here."" All the while nethers and cheaters are out to kill you.TL;DR? Be prepared to have a lot of work canceled by cheaters, you are never really safe anywhere, to get the good stuff you have to spend more real world money, and you are wasting your time if you expect anything resembling a storyline.

												I wish I could recommend this game, but its REALLY incomplete.  Nether was really cool, awesome graphics, interesting enemies, and very co-op from what IGN showed.  It was for the longest time really fun.  Then they made it more like Dayz and those types of games.  People kill whoever they see and steal your stuff.  While not fully pay 2 win where you can get clothes for money and a few other things, you can buy weapons, guns, and food.  For a survival game this doesn't seem right.  This game has become kind of a disaster with people running around killing players, updates are no longer coming out as frequently.  I miss when this game was fresh, but now it seems like a generic survival game.			"

												TL;DR - It's Meh.  Go spend your money elsewhere and be happier.  Pros:  Great environment.  Okay gameplay.  Okayish graphics. Cons:  ugh.  buggy. hackers all over creation and seemingly no will to stop them.  safe zones drop as part of the game, opening areas to PVE mobs that are usually kept out...okay, ramping up the difficulty is something I like...but also opens safe zones, including the noob spawn, to PVP elements as well.  So spawn and die and spawn and die, or just quit for a while.  I found people actively killing those trying to get spawn safe again.  Seriously?  I like a challenge but I couldn't even get started in game at all because I kept getting slaughtered at spawn. That said, let's talk about getting started in the first place.  Tutorials around tell you *what* things are and a few basics but how to progress in the game? Psh, whatever yo.  I had to search on the internet to figure out what courier missions were and how to run them.  Inventory management is weird as hell, but that's an issue with every game. Don't waste your money on it.  It's not a horrible game, but it's just not worth the few bucks unless you're okay with playing it for a week and getting nowhere.			"

												Nether is, obviously, still a work in progress, but I would hold off on getting it if I were you.  Most of the gameplay consists of getting completely dissoriented and unbearably lost until somebody one-shots you from out of nowhere.  There's no chance to defend yourself or even duck in cover because the creators aspired for the game to be so ""realistic"" that pistol bullets do 87% of your health per shot, and the only way to survive is to destroy fellow humanity around you and kill other players, which is infuriating to freshly spawned players that can't even get to a safezone before getting sniped.  On top of all of this, upon death, you lose all of your non-aparrel items and a good chunk of cash, plus all of your player levels and skill points.  This discourages the hard work you put towards gaining all of this, including spending extra money, and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it if someone decides to be a paranoid prick and pull the trigger.  Until the game is rebalanced, segregated for separate PvE/PvP servers, and more focused on surviving the Nether onslaught rather than hiding in the safezone because you're afraid you'll be shot the second you step outside, don't play this game.

								Bought this game did not play for a couple of months  cos i thought it would be an♥♥♥♥♥kicken pvp wise, ruthless i played dayz for a while but the PVP was too harsh for my book this game skirts the edge of that although at first you`ll get taken out by players alot at first it should not take you too long to learn the enviroment and how you can use it to your advantage, me personaly i`ll wait for the trouble to die down then continue the mission. The fighting with the nether is really responsive and their teleportation just keeps you on your toes i find melee is the best course of action hell yeah you could shoot em but the noise! even in the underground it`s dangerous to run just in case they here you from above.Atmosphere is amazing audio and visual its one of those game where you`ll turn up the volume so you can hear whats on the other side of the wall wether it be nether or player. Im having alot of fun (frustration at times) with this game Well Impressed :)			"

								**** DISCLAIMER - Yes I know this is an alpha game and I am a terri-bad player!! Also I get a little long winded in spots! If your attention span can't handle it, don't read!! Hopefully this will help people deciding on buying the game. Number ratings are at the bottom after my long winded parts ;-) ******""A DAYZ Killer"" they said in the banner... well as much as I love DAYZ, I had to go research. A survival game the research showed! In a sprawling urban environment with tribes working to capture and hold parts of the city. Ok, so it looked like a more robust end game style, perfect! The videos and screens were of some sort of monsters that I could only guess were mutated zombies of some sort. Well... that'll teach me to do dive too quickly and not read further...So I bought the game. First load in showed the city to be beautiful. A stark setting under a dark sky with strange sounds all around. I hestitantly walked forward 30 feet... bam... dead. Oh it looks like another survivor in this sprawling expanse found me and wanted my butter knife. Ok no prob... respawn... get two blocks and find an axe!! Perfect that wil... bam... dead from behind. Oh... ok. Respawn in the world... 1 minute later... bam... They sure do want their butter knives in this city. Ok so I will respawn in a ""safezone"". Spawn in... bam bam bam! Oh good, a tribe is camping the safezone during an event where the safezones are not...safezones. Ooookay.... So began the frustration. I did like the character leveling tree, but it's gone as soon as you get killed. Items seem cheesy when you run into them. If you have ever played DAYZ or few of the mods you'll see what I mean. Let me stand perfectly still while I hold the ""E"" button down to spend four seconds of actual time to pickup a... soda. That doesn't expose me at all in this ""survival game"". And now the creatures... horrifying... kind of. Relatable? No... Sci-fi-ish? Yes... And that is how this game should have been marketed. They should have never mentioned DAYZ except for purely the money grab to get people all excited to buy it. The creatures are fairly decent models and have great sounds. They also teleport... yup that is right. Flashy light, poof, they are behind you, to your side, etc etc. In a first person game, that makes them a pretty decent threat. Ok... so I am new spawn with a butter knife, I know I can't take on some of these things. I'll run! The game does have a cool stamina bar that as you level your character (don't get killed!), can be beefed up. Problem... the creatures don't need to run. They watch you run like a fool, teleport to you and swing. Ouch... you keep running, they teleport again, poof, swing aaaaand your dead. And I tested it... it doesn't matter if you jump over things, try to lose them in a building, etc. They WILL find you. So that means no running. Ok I will swing with them with my butter knife! Boom health points start to drop on you rapidly. One or two confrontations and you are smoked. Creature mechanics... ='s bad.... especially when players are taking you out with a few swings of their melee weapons.In game stores... this is kind of neat. An end of the world shop area where people trade you for things you find. Cigarettes etc. This makes it so you can get currency that allows you to buy a little better gear. Just don't get caught here when the safezone nether devices fail. Tribes camp people here... not creatures... why? Darned if I know...In short folks, if you are COD/Battlefielder where you shoot everything on site, this may be a slight distraction.So 6 hours later... here is the first impressionSo for the scales: 1 worst, 10 bestCharacter Control: 7 (I liked the jumping, was fairly smooth, but dropped it a point due to not being able to side step when sprinting)Weapons: 7 (when you can get them, they are fairly cool)Graphics: 7 (dropped this due to the item graphics and flashing, makes for no real searching like in other games. Just run around looking for the flashes/glowing to find things to search)Creature/NPC: 6 (superbad mechanics for newbies - other players are bad enough to deal with)Leveling: 7 (I liked the idea of the tree leveling - but it lost it's flair when I realized how fast you lose it)Crafting: 5 (interestingly enough you find pieces of things to piece together back at the safe zone. But holy heck... give me a weapon I can actually use seeing as a person can get killed every minute by creatures or players. Pick a low pop server at first folks if you want even a chance of trying this out!)UI: 5 (rudimentary UI, with a decent map waypoint system. Horrible settings/config. It doesn't even show all the key bindings but will holler at you if you try to remap something that is already bound)Ingame Chat/Voice: 4 (I never found a way to have a local/area chat so anything you say goes straight to global/largescale area. Better not plan a tribe take over in that! The voice chat was fairly horrible the few seconds I heard someone try it.)Community: 1 (yup a 1... better bring some friends if you are serious about trying this)Clan/Tribe Activity: 4 (you can take over area's of the city. I went to area's that said they were unclaimed and was told that I had to stand in a certain area for five minutes. Supposedly a bar would come up that showed my progress. Again, with no basic level info, I went out to forums to find out just this information. No one would say in global or chat. I never did get to claim any area's. Perhaps you have to be a clan, but I never really got to talk to anyone in an attempt to join one. Pretty much anyone that I saw coming, was filling me and my butter knife full of lead...)Grouping/In game event: 6  (I saw some people talking in global chat, and they went and secured some type of objective. It reminded me a little of Defiance and Rift in that aspect. The problem comes from people also going there to shoot you as you try to complete said objectives.)PvP: 8 (If you like the COD/Battlefield style play with a little sci-fi-ish NPC's thrown in, you might like this)Survival Aspect: 4 (The emphasis on this game is killing creatures and players. It feels like the food meter is an after-thought, that adds one more thing in the game that can kill you. Trust me, unless you bring a posse', this will never be a real problem for you. If you come into this game expecting the feel of DAYZ SA, you will not find that here. This survival is based against other players and the creatures which makes it feel just like another CoD/BF4ish game. It's a run and gun... or butter knife...)Storyline: 5 (rudimentary tutorial missions when you first start - IF you can finish them. No over all arching story missions or quests. You have no idea why you are running around trying to kill people other than to just take their stuff)Overall rating: 4.93  (I may try to play it another hour so that I feel I haven't completely wasted my 14.99... but I am not sure if I can bring myself too)			"

												P.O.S Game. I generally dont really critique games. However this is just utter garbage.I got the game on sale 80% off. So i paid 3 bucks. Even then i wish i could get that money back. I feel dirty patronizing these people one way or another.The game is broken. Plain and simple. Most 'solid objects' you can easilly pass through. Including the ground, Trees, and Houses.You can also sink through the ground if your trying to swim in water. There is no swimming capabilites at all, which makes roughlly half of the map unplayable.The game also feels very baren and downright boring. There is nothing much to do other then fight 'nether' (which are essentially gigantic teleporting mutants), who have terrible AI pathfinding. It is very easy to just go around a corner, and get the enemy AI stuck.You can easilly kill enemies THROUGH WALLS. And not even with a gun. A knife can cut through a wall and kill an enemy. Due to its model clipping through the wall. You can easilly take out huge baddies using this. Though obviouslly exploitable, this hole game is just full of game holes.The worst about the game is the fact it does not even function most of the time. The game tends to simply not run. It will generally freeze on the server loading screen. Where the developers say the only way to get the game to work is to sit patientlly staring at the frozen screen for around 5 minutes. Alt tabbing or Ctrl Alt Deleting to check if its running will crash it.The game also likes to crash on its launcher which seems to have been done using VB with almost no help and no pre launch game options avalible to you.The game will also crash randomlly after 20 minutes to an hour. Even with a great gaming rig. The game also when it DOES play will also have at best 30 FPS. The game also likes to generally crash on loading into a server.The modeling for the characters and NPC's is dreadful and lackluster. The world looks boring and dated.The hole game is dull and an outright waste of time. Even if this was a free to play game i would scream avoid like the plague.			"

												I can't reccomend a game that won't even let you create an account after you have paid money to play it! Even tho it's early access, you should be able to make an account at least!! As far as the game play who know's what it's like, you have to have an account to play it!! :(			"

												I was excited to see Nether on sale on Steam, not only have i been waiting to buy it but now i also had a weekend coming up to play it in.OH BOY was i disapointed.I've spent a few hours after i quit.no monsters to find, no materials to find, no players to find, barely any NPC's even in the safezones ( wtf ?!? ).And also i died after i walked in a little pool of water, didnt know the water was ♥♥♥♥ing magically toxic or eletricified in this game...over all, the game seems very empty with nothing to do and not much information when you are in the game.when i run over things like small door stepps it kinda like gets stuck bouncing up and down untill i jump or try from another angle, also this happends in many other places.Turning around feels un-natual, almost like an old game.It is not easy to figure out what the heck you do in this game.3/10 so faar, only nice thing in the idea and the envoirement, its just not nearly finished.cheers			"

												I have held off writing this review for a variety of reason, most of which I will address but I want to begin by saying that at its core, Nether is a fun game. A vast, beautiful world that although seemingly barren is jammed full of things to explore. The possibility for looting is everywhere and the nether that inhabit the city make for fun opponents if not the most challenging (this is of course after getting a few guns, otherwise you’re in for a rough time). By far the biggest impact of the game comes from the player base and how you come to interact with it. I started off by reading a bit and prepared for the usual spawn campers that inhabit all survival games. The first 5 hours of gameplay were terrible and I am sorry but there is no other way to put it. A combination of the fore mentioned spawn campers and lack of gear resulted in countless deaths for no gain. Eventually though you will survive enough runs between safe zones to get a small stockpile of weapons and ammo which gives you a few options, continue exploring deeper into the city, collecting as you go or become that which is hated by entering the pseudo pvp. I call it that because there is no give or take by investing in the melee tree, you have a gun or you die and even then you will still die but only to other gun holders. Sadly this game seems to center too much on murdering other players for their stuff. I am about 20 hours into the game and although there are servers where people will work together and explore this possibly great game, for the most part it’s just people who get their rocks off by spawn camping. I have read that a pve environment may be in the works but unless the AI is improved then that will be the ultimate care bear of this game (making courier package runs is reasonably easy already minus the players that snipe everyone entering or leaving a safe zone). So the long and short of my review comes to this, Nether is a fantastic idea that with enough time and tweaking could have been the fallout mmo that some gamers like myself have been waiting for, but  a combination of in-game bugs which ranged from my flashlight never turning on to ramps and platforms not actually being between building so all you get is a nice 50 foot death fall, as well as a dimwitted AI and terrible player base which are trapped in the ""I am l33t you are n00b"" mentality ruin this game for continued play. As I said before I held off reviewing this because I wanted very much to enjoy it with seemingly small problems ruining my experience. Unfortunately the slow development cycle, player base, and almost laughable enemy AI have finally pushed the game past the point of enjoyment. It is a chore to find playable servers with minimal bugs and players that have more social skills than road kill. I wish the developers the best because there is a solid idea here but it needs a lot of work. 4.5/10 "

												Unfortunately this game is not what I hoped it would be. I played from the beta and even then all that happened was i would roam around and find some stuff kill a nether with my knife then meet another player only to be killed. I was killed by players more than the nethers. The ""Community"" is terrible and you can't enjoy the awesome game because people want to be A-holes. The environments was cool and the concept great but because of people like almost all other things it is ruined. If you like being murdered all the time and wasting time then this is the game for you. I don't blame the people who worked hard to get the game made, I blame the idiotic people who find it fun to ruin a great game for everyone else. So to all the A$$ holes who ruined the game: F. U.

												When the steam sale came around, and I saw this game, I was very excited. I really wanted a great survival game to play online that i could really sink my teeth into. Unfortunately, I've giving up on that game being Nether. The first thing I've noticed is the time it takes to get a game started; It takes a while to even spawn. Ok, I can get through that if the gameplay is gripping. Once you do spawn you're given a brief explanation of how/where to buy things, what tribes are & how to join them, and then sort of set loose.Running around the world is pretty amusing, but I lacked the little bit of guidance I needed to get care about the world of the game. I know a lot of people feel duped, becasue this game feels unfinished. Framerate issues are common, and starting over from your many, many, deaths feels like a chore rather than a new adventure.			"

												What a huge wase of time and money.  This is an unmitigated failure of a game.  I get that this is post apacalypse and it is supposed to be a hard life, but come on.The autolauncer want me to sign up for their service...It fails.  Google tells me that I am not the only one, I go to the company's website and sign up there.  That works OK.graphically the game is OK, muddy and drab,  but it does not run very well.  even on the lowest settings.  Reminds me of Fallout 3, but without the quality control.  you will get stuck every so often on some piece of landscape until the game generously vomits you forth into clear terrain.  I wish I had something to positive to say about this.  Hmmm, I guess the sound is well done.  1.  Game started me out in a safe zone...Wow, apparently the safe zones are randomly unsafe.  First three characters died within 15 feet of thier starting point, swarmed by teleporting mobs with nothing to defend myself but a kitchen knife.  2.  1 person tried to help me, but he was swamped by a hoard as well.  3.  Finally someone secures the safe zone and I randomly stumble upon some package that it tells me to deliver somewhere, but does not indicate where I have to go.  (I'm guessing you have to really know the maps)  agian stumbled into the right place and was able to turn in the package to get a reward.    then I was given a quest to deliver something outside the zone.  I get 80% of the way there and hear a ping sound and my character falls dead.  I can only assume someone I could not see shot me.  4.  I try again, this time trying to be stealthy.  But this time I don't have the benefit of my prior turn in.  I start out a squeeker again.  OK,  this time I get trounced by mobs.5.  Again.  Someone takes me out with a shotgun6.  I opt to spawn in the wilderness.  Find a beeping box that apparently I have to bring somewhere...Not that I can tell where I have to bring it, so I try to head to home base.  The box takes both hands.  So I can't defend myself...Can't find a way to quickly driop it so I run.  I get within visual distance of the base (after 5 minutes of frenzied pursuit) onlt to be shot, I guess so someone at a higher level won't have to be bothered with walking so far.  This game might be more fun if they had some way to ease into the game or some kind of tutorial or a better hud that allowed you to pinpoint where you had to go (oh, they do let you make waypoints, but all that does it put a little tick on the compass rose and that feature sucks for finding your way around).  Or a better map, or less clipping, or smoother graphics, or a less brutal starting point or a reasonalby reliable way for you to escape predatory PVP trolls. The servers are too small to allow for a robust community to defend Noobs.  there just are not enough people.  Even if there were, they would have no reason too. I see no fun in this game, nor do I see any future.  If this were an Alpha build but no, perhaps if they were do form a new server so that new people stood a chance in the world.  I'll try it agin in a few weeks, but I'm going to chalk this one up to Caveat Emptor.			"

												Well I spent the first four days just trying to get into a server. I run more graphic intesive games requiring higher bandwidth so its not my rig. After you wait for the ungodly amount of time required to actually get the servers list to respond you will be met with the highly unintuitive list of servers. Dont bother trying to sort it, the list is in the order the devs want it to be in and the rest of us can just ♥♥♥♥ off. Once you actually get into a game, which should be a Steam Achievment all by itself, you are immediately met with two scenarios: You are instantly gang♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by  a bunch of monsters, or, you are instantly sniped by another player camping the spawn zone. But lets say you escape the spawn zone with your hide intact. Try not attack any monsters when near rocks...or trees...or buildings.......or ANYTHING that they might clip into when doing their riddiculous teleportation dance, because it will make your game crash. Spend your money on DayZ.			"

												I play games here and there and I can say that Nether is made only for those who are into serious PvP and hardmode FPS games. For someone like me who doesn't really commit to any particular game, this game is impossible. Nethers aggro very easily and you lose all of your equipment when you die. On top of that other players will 99% try to kill you to loot your weapons, ammo and healing items. Yes, you get a chance to recover your dropped items when you die, but if you happen to die far from a spawn point then tough luck, chances are, you'll either die again on your way there from nethers or other player OR your dropped items have already despawned. very frustrating when you have spent the last 2 hours farming to get a weapon and lose it the next minute.Also, this game is not for people who likes to play solo. you will get swarmed by either nethers or other players. so if you will get this game even after reading this review, better make sure you join a tribe.So nether would be an amazing game for people who are totally into PvP FPS. But it is definitely not for me, I would rather play something that would give me less challenge but allow me to explore the world without dying every 15 minutes and lose all of my gear.			"

												Terrible. Just terrible.I'm a huge fan of post-apocalyptic games. Anything from L4D, DayZ, RFG, and just about anything of the sort gets me going and excited for the playing of it. I was looking at Nether for a while. I finally had enough to swing the medium pack and get playing, which was hard enough to swing the money. I was super excited, but it was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made.The game requires an other-than-steam account, which besides Origin, I truly despise. (ABP: Reloaded for example) And signals a glitchy, popy, irradicated, unsatisfactory gameplay. (At least with my experience.) The game took forever to ""verify"" my account, and failed ~12 times. When I was able to finally get on, I attempted to start into a server. The game froze at the server screen and I had to restart 3 times to get the servers screen to work. Finally, it was EXSCRUTIATING to find a server with people in  it. When I finally joined, I only had a knife. I know games want you to have a slight start up, but this took FOREVER with no action at all. When I finally left the designated ""Safe Zone"" there was nothing to loot. Nothing. No guns, no weaponry, no armor, no working vehicles, nothing. I ran around with a crowbar and hit a few buildings when I decided enough.Finally, I went back into the safe zone to find out that the Nethers were in there causing chaos with the new players there. Nothing could be done and we were fending off 8 foot tall monstrosities with butter knives.After 5 consecutive deaths, I called it quits.0/10, never playing again. The first time I ever REALLY wished I could get a refund for a game. It took me 8 days to get that 6$ usd and I regret spending it on this TERRIBLE game. Don't buy it. I sent my friend a 72 hour pass since it was on his wish list.He took it off 30 minutes later. I'm extremely dissapointed. I expect Steam to filter out junk like this. I've since then lowered my standards.			"

Nethers is very dificult enemies, becouse they can run very fast and teleport, not like slowly zombie :)We must collect foods and weapones to survive. So this is PVP and PVE.In addition to the Nether have better graphics than DayZ, WarZ or Rust.So I recoment You that game seriously :)I am Pole, so if I make errors, sorry...Thx, for reading, Bye-Bye!

								The first thing that sticks out in nether is the atmosphere. You realize taht this isn't a good place to be and you are going to want some friends. Although most people will kill you on sight, playing with friends really adds to the expierence. Slowly leveling you characters and working together doing escort missions or capturing a territory for your tribe. Then one of you teamates gets sniped and all hell breaks lose, literally hell,  nethers are just like demons. This games really is a bunch of fun and definetly worth it.			"

								Well i was really looking forward to playing this game with my friend, but i couldn't because i have a 32 bit os. This game requires a 64 bit os, so i am unable to play it. I really hope it will be playable on 32 bit os soon. I was watching people pla it and it looks really cool. Can't wait till i'll be able to play.			"

												Just bought the game today and guess what, i can't even go through the server selection screen. The game froze and crashed (tried it multiple times). Yes it was on sale when i bought it, but to me $3.00 is not freaking cheap!. The first impression of this game make me not to recommend it to anyone else. Might as well buy another game worth $3.00.			"

								This game got boring really fast.  It's not very fun to run around for 45 minutes trying to find a gun only to get killed, respawn, and do it again.And in the rare occassion you do get a gun?  You'll probably be killed.  This game is laggy, the collision is terrible, there's no sense of purpose whatsoever, everything is 100x more expensive than it should be, the world is empty, and everyone's a jerk who will probably kill you, no questions asked.Do not buy this game.  Maybe it'll be better once it's actually released, but I'm never buying another Early Access game again.  What a waste of money.			"

												If you're buying it during the Steam sale for $5 and just want to know if it's stable enough to be worth playing based on recent reviews, for me the process of creating an account and logging in was painless, as was my first hour or so of playtime, other than a few minor bugs (none that crashed game yet). There's a lot I've run into that seems inspired by the STALKER series, but the most immediate connection to me is the environment, which feels alive, gorgeous and terrifying in the same way. Hurrying from building to building feels sort of like being an insect - stay out of sight in whatever dark spaces you can find, and hope that you don't get stepped on.			"

												Has the potential to be a great survival game, but until it is polished and updated completely with endgame material, it will be nothing more than a WarZ/Infestation clone. ( A better one though)			"

												The gameplay may look okay but it is VERY VERY badly made, possibly the worst ever. They Lure you in with big discounts for a game that freezes, wont load, and doesn't work what so ever. I have looked it up and i am not alone, there are hords of people out there who paid good money and simply can not play this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.. Wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy			"

												So I have DayZ and this game. This game so far beats DayZ in many ways, not going to name them all but I'll give two. 1st this game does not have as many bugs as DayZ and also this game isn't as harsh when it comes to dying. 10/10 would kill more Nether creatures			"

												Bought this package after I saw Vanoss and H2ODelirious goofing off in a YouTube vid. I know that the game is survive by anymeans, but when you're insta-killed by people in the (alledged) safe zone, where's the fun? This is a game that had potential and somehow squandered it.			"

								After a difficult installation with codes and logins and usernames outside of Steam, I joined some laggy client that froze non-stop. After managing to join a ""game"", there was nothing but a large map of buildings where you could collect chocolate bars, etc. Then if you reached an area located in the map, there were these stupid monsters that ignored all walls and buildings and teleported at you. They looked really lame and pixely, and ""fighting"" them was ridiculous. I would not recommend this ""game"" to anyone. I want my money back.			"

												I had spawned into the world. The kitchen knife in my right hand was sharp, I soon headed my way into a building. A crate sat inside the building that was glowing gold. It was just screaming for me, screaming ""LOOT ME!!!"" As I placed my head onto the crate, the option had appeared. ""Hold E to Loot"" I held E. The spinning white icon excited me. Would I get a gun, a gun part, anything? The white spinning icon turned into a full white circle. ""Not enough keys to unlock."" The words printed onto my screen. I had recieved nothing. I was a loser. I still had my kitchen knife. Nothing else. I was a failure.			"

								Yes, yes ,yes ,yes. Out of all the survival games I've played so far (most of the popular ones and a few not so popular ones) nether is by far the best multiplayer one. Great gameplay and amazing updates almost every month. As a warning though there are quite a few bugs, but you get amazing content and a stunning world to play in. 8/10 Rust: 6/10 Day Z: 7/10 Contagion: 5/10			"
