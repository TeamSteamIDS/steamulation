												There's plenty good and not so good about this game, and it really takes the idea of alternate history and allows you to basically do whatever you want. (Parentheses are examples)Positives+ Change History! (Romania kings of the world!!+ Easily understandable, especially to new players in the strategy games like these.+ Fun to crush every country around you with your massive military might (YARGG)+ Follows ideologies to connect to follow the historical path (AI UK actually allies with AI US and AI France)+ High mod support (Canadian colony in Somalia in an 1861 scenario!)+ Many different types of units to be built.+ All those factories are making me rich!! (Bucharest is more industrialized then New York, London, and Berlin Combined!)+ You can form rediculous alliances (The Swedish alliance containing Sweden, Liberia, Argentina, and Bulgaria)Negatives- No casus belli- Declaring war too many times causes other nations to join in against you (I'm looking at you United Kingdom)- The AI just builds up military and doesn't really care about economy (Switzerland at $-200,000,000,000 at end game)- Rebels too easy to crush (Why wont you let me become fascist Norway?)- Countries only surrender to you if you crush them super fast with a massive force (I just want Ukraine not all of the USSR)- If you ally with a nation ('Cough' 'Cough' AI 'Cough') When they declare war you're dragged into it as well, if you want to be in in or not- AI sometimes extremly random (AI Finland at war with every single country but Hungary, AI Germany allies with AI Albania and kills AI Italy)Overall though, fun to play and good to think about what would really happen if Luxembourg conquered South America9.7/10			"

												Going to be a long text, so TLDR; get the first installment of the series, The Calm and the Storm. Its definatly more worth its pricetag.If you already own the first installment, keep playing that, as you will not gain much for the 20 Bucks here.The game, while theoreticaly quite fun, has some problems which just ruin the experience, the biggest one being that it just runs poorly. While I do have a decent machine, nothing fancy, but also not bad in any way (AMD 6300FX, 8gb, R9-290). Turntimes start off very fast, but do get longer over the course of the game. Not too long, but still somewhat annoying, considering that you will spend the majority of gameplay clicking away idle turns (If you're playing historically about 230 turns, just until the beginning of the war).My main issue is however, that everything feels ""slow"" and ""lagging"" as in. Scrolling the map makes the scrolling ""stutter"", so the map doesnt move smoothe but keeps jumping. This also is technically not a problem, as you can easily get anywhere on the map, but it just doesnt feel right and stressful. Giving commands to units, opening Menues and virtually clicking anywhere has a delay of ~0.5-1 second (didnt measure it, but its just... you feel it, you know?). That doesnt seem like much but it is annoying as hell and makes the playing experience simply feel ""unsmooth"" and, to some extend, especially when giving a large amount of orders, stressful. This is enhanced by the games second problem. The second problem im having with this game is its interface. Everything feels like it needs at least one click too much. For example: Merging 2 units requires you to have both units in the same province (of course...). Then you select one and right click on the other one. Then a dropdown menu appears and you can select ""merge units"" at which point you need to select the unit you JUST rightclicked on from the appearing ""list"", which (in the 6 hours i played so far) has never shown more that the exact unit I rightclicked on anyway, even if there are multiple units in the province. Or for example research, where there is no ""each laboratory that can, research the same thing"" button. You need to select a research option for each single laboratory when you just want all of them to research the same thing. Why 30 clicks instead of 1? The game has no tutorial and close to no tooltips but only an encyclopedia. This is in most cases only a minor inconvinience since, in opposition to lets say the hearts of iron series, most things are grasped somewhat easily and without explanation. However, in production and research, this lack of help is very annoying. When selecting production over the City-Screen you get a LITTLE bit more info, but usually you will be chosing production from the production menu (where you see all cities) and here you get virtually no help to tell you for example the difference between a cottage factory, a mechanised factory, a large factory aso.Research is even worse. In the research tree, options are only shown linked to the last thing they need, however, they may have other requirements from earlier in the research tree. This is only shown as a symbol which will give you the name of the required prerequisit research, which you may then search in the researchtree yourself, followed by searching that researches mandatory prerequisits. If you want to know what any of these researches does (What it gives is also just shown as a Noun, like ""Highway"", you may go to the enzyclopedia and search for Highway to figure out if this is useful in any way to you. This is of course not linked but requires you to actually look through the encyclopeida.) This is a joke, and, once again, Civilization did it better 1/4 Century ago.The building menu is not sorted. When clicking on production you will get a dropdown menu with ~20-40 production possibilies to scroll through (the dropdown isnt that large, so for some things which you will be chosing a lot, like Tanks, you will need to scroll down), changing your production around for a larger country, for example when switching to tank or airplane production, is just a chore.The game has barely any feedback to ""problems"" in your country. For example when your researchers have no goal set you are simply loosing turns in research for no reason, but the game doesnt tell you, instead you need to either memorize every time when you current research is going to be done, or you need to check every couple of turns. There is no reason why the game would let you end your turn with no research selected, like EVERY OTHER GAME ON THE MARKET, starting from 24 Years old Civilization! The Idea of making the game more sandboxish, allowing countries to ally and fight whoever they want (with some path laying out, but not mandatory) is very good. The execution is rather poorly, with the world AI reminding me of the Total War Series in regards to its ""intelligence"". While only playing 6 hours I have witnessed twice countries declaring war, just to be annihilated themselves minutes later, since they were not even close to being a match to the enemy. Making Alliances and Trade agreements is just a gamble with no rhyme or reason whatsoever as to who will ally/trade with you. (There is somewhat of a ""like""-meter, but it appears to have no influence on the other countries decision and it is almost impossible to change the like-meter anyway.All in all, if you, like me, are looking for a simplified hearts of iron (Thanks to youtube I didnt find Hearts of Iron III to be that difficult to understand, I just found it to be chore with the bazillion provinces and no fun to automate the War-AI) I would recommend the first part of this series (the calm and the storm). While that game definatly has problems of its own (max resolution of 1024x768 with no widescreen option for example) it runs way better, the AI seems more predictable (in this case meant in a positive way as in - the guy with MASSIVE amounts of food who loves you will probably sell you some) and it felt more fast-paced as this one. Also its only 4Euros (got it for 1 in a sale), as to the 20 of this game.			"

												This is one game i reccomend to people who like world war 2 strategy games. There is a very hard learning curve at first but once you get used to it the game will keep you playing and planning for diffrent things. Just like the game itself the editor is hard to figure out but once you get the hang of it the editor is really interesting to use. The only real complaint is that if you have a large nation you have to do a lot of clicking per turn and that leaves your mouse hand sore after only a few turns. One thing I like is that the AI has done somthing I did not expect every game. For example in my most recent game the ussr invaded norway only for germany to declare war on the ussr and both duked it out in norway. (germany did not conquer anything at that point so the only line of contact was norway) A good game and one I would like to continue playing into the future.Update: multiplayer is broken beyond belief for several reasons. one is that steam version of this game is no longer updated. two the game crashes on lan games all the time. and three to play online multiplayer you have to go to the website of the game and register and you can't play senarios onlinei would still get this game for single player but not multiplayer			"

												This game has it all - not only must you build up your military, which can be affected from morale, experience, and even weather, but you must maintain the economy by feeding your population and extracting resources. Moreover, you must maintain political stability during all defenses and conquests, lest you desire a revolt! Luckily, you can write up your own trade agreements, make alliances (even if they are not historically accurate) and declare war on whoever you damn well please.The game is incredibly realistic and a metric butt ton of fun.There is no tutorial, so much learning will be trial and error: but it's totally worth it.

												This game has been a lot of fun for me. With improved UI and the good kind of simplification(compared to the first one), this game is a must consider for those who love history, military, or strategy. Although the main downside is a not good tutorial and you are thrust into WW2 not knowing sh*t. Also those with no or little patience will most likely not like the game or at least some of the nations (cough) USSR (cough) due to the large amount of starting regions. To sandwich the bad I can also say no game will ever be the same in any way, whether it be the Italy AI taking France or the British commonwealth and America taking on Russia, all AI with no player interference. The diplomacy is good especially in war time when you can take advantage of another nations need in a war (me aka Germany sideing with America and the UK to fight Russia).In short- Try it. Shut up and try it if you have the money and you are patient.			"

												This is a strategy game were you, control your Nation of choosing and lead them to a new age of ligth or darkness. You can try to remain neutral in a world at war, join a faction or make your own. What ever you pick, the game will be interesting and unpredictable. However, unlike the first Making History game, this game has several issues; like crashes, wrong ideologies in several countries, and a horrible menu. The game is fun, the graphics are better than the previous one but that doesn't make it a better game. I would recommend the previous Making History, the first game of the series.			"

												i  like this game quite  lot, i find it easy to play and it makes me think a little about the management structure and future planning and policy of which ever nation im playing, all good stuff.     but it has its glitches.     one of which is, that when i am defending an area, small enemy units which, on the surface  appear to be weaker than mine. will arrive suddenly and wipe out my larger defending force with its bunkers, without so much as a fight.  i have experienced this time after time playing many different nations and its quite frustrating as it gives me no time to react. the defending units just simply vanish and i will have lost a region in the blink of an eye.  also the stacking function. an enemy unit icon will tell you that a particular enemy unit has a hit point factor in say 15 points and that its only 1 inf unit. but when you scroll over that enemy unit ,you will often find that it actually contains several larger units which you cant see. 20 or 30 different units is not uncommon.  this can often be a game changer which may well render any plans you had, utterly useless. i dont really understand the purpose of stacking when you can merge units.

												TL;DR: pls buff tibetI've barely played the game and I'm already addicted, definitely one of my favourite nation-simulator type games. You can literally do anything. I've seen Belgium conquer Africa, Italy take over Greenland (with 1 tank), Poland conquering Nazi Germany... Anything is possible. Except with Tibet,NeverPlayTibet.By the time you build anything, Communist Canada would have won the game 3 times over. If you're like me and WW2 interests you, this game is definitely for you. With the addition of Steam Trading Cards, I can only imagine what the game would be like if the developers the implemented workshop compatibility! And yes, the game is still being updated if you're wondering.However MH2 isn't perfect, there could be a lot of improvements mainly with configuration settings. The graphical options are very limited and although the game has keyboard shortcuts, they are preset and cannot be edited. I've also found that the game can be incredibly confusing to beginners such as myself, but I've had fun learning how to play it. The gameplay is quite different from any other nation-simulation strategy games and the mechanics are quite cool. Definitely willing to look into the other games in the Making History series. #bufftibetpls			"

												Alright so this game has its ups and downs, however i cannot recomend it. as my first reveiw let it be clear however that this game is MUCH better than the first one, however this  game still has glaring flaws and well my biggest complaint the ai spaming 1 type of unit and then steam rolling you. said unit in question would be primarily early tanks. what happens is 1 enemy city only produces said unit and then when you finially ready to invade over a large front, the stack of doom precides to beat even a well rounded that mind you is more than likely much more advanced that there units (we are talking medium tank II, mech inf,inf V so on and so forth)  vs a dozen or so units of outdated early tanks that just win due to redicules numbers and huge attack points. id be fine with with said numbers spread out to defend along my line of attack. but a stack of doom defeats the purpose when the ai concentrates all there units in a single army. my other biggest grief is the ui but ive ranted eneufe. its a fun game dont get me wrong, but its also frustrating watching your panthers and tigers being beat by ft-17s			"

												This is an excellent improvement on the original Making History: The Calm and the Storm, and a great springboard to Making History: The Great War. A reasonable selection of start dates is offered, all of which will eventually lead to war in some form or other. However the game is simple enough for you to master quickly with patience in the early start scenarios that give you plenty of time to get to grips with the basics. It's all about balance in peace and preparing for the excesses of wartime. BUT! One mistake and you are, as the game suggests, ""history"". Everyone gets a chance in this fairly challenging game, but once the shooting starts you had better have your best fighting trousers on, for there will be no ""phoney war"" in which you can make ready. Remember-""no battle plan survives contact with the enemy"". Good luck & good hunting.			"

Posted: January 9, 2016
												The bottom line:It's horrifically balanced. Death stacks of a few hundred infantry units will weather almost any attack with their high defence value and then happily mop up anything left of the attacking army. Focusing your economy purely on infantry will always give the most bang for your buck - delving into the game's impressive variety of units to build a mixture in each stack will never be as potent as pure infantry. Front lines don't really exist either, the AI will roll through in one province with a gigantic death stack of infantry - there is rarely a nuanced breakthrough or any sort of meaningful strategic warfare.--------------------------------This is even the more painful because, that said, it's a game that almost gets it right. It never comes close to rivalling Hearts of Iron 3 (Hoi3) in terms of depth or detail but it doesn't attempt to - it's a game not a simulation (despite the developer's claim that it's educational). Building up industrial capacity and research is refreshingly simple and engaging, allowing you to change history within reason and raise medium-sized countries into great powers. Unlike Hoi3 there's plenty of value in playing as countries other than Britain, America, Russia and Germany. When the game works it's fun. The tech tree is a good balance of detail and simplicity and there are plenty of historical units. The problem is there's no point in building them because infantry is so strong in defence.Diplomacy is a weak point: there are few options, there's no way to take single provinces in a peace deal (you either take everything you've occupied or annex the whole country) and alliances are almost impossible to make (unless you're already fighting a mutual enemy, by which time they are largely pointless).The interface is ok. The map's pretty ugly but on the whole it's clear. However, things are undeniably clunky. It's sometimes difficult to select units as the stacking fuction is poor and basic tasks can be overly complicated. There's no way to merge fleets whilst in port than I know of and you can't combine two fighters on the same aircraft carrier without unloading them from carrier, which is a feat of messy clicking in itself. Selecting army and air force stacks that are near each other is also difficult. On the upside, the national roundels underneath each unit are cool.The game would still be enjoyable even with the niggling issues in diplomacy and the interface (and it is fun until you actually go to war) but the combat balance is so off that I can't recommend this game. Watching my upgraded army of 40 infantry+20 artillery+10 engineers+10 tanks be attacked and -completely- wiped out by 200 infantry in -one- turn, (yes, 80 casulties to 0) despite having a higher defence value than the opposing infantry stack's attack value, was when I gave up on this game.

												The game is pretty good and has lots of replayability. The only thing lacking for me is diversification on the units parts. Every faction has the same units and there's no unique units or buildings. That's very good for balance reasons but take some of the flavor of WWII games away. I really enjoyed playing it tho and messing with the editor and making my own country taking the whole world.I really recommend for the price especially if you can get with a discount. Also this is tottaly superior to the Making History 1. And I don't recommend you playing the first one as this is basically an improved version.Overall Score:7/10			"

												This is one of my favourite pc games ever, however it isn't all perfect. I don't like the way that the nation you play as and you allied nations have handicaps on the IPU's and that there should be an option to turn that on and off. And the diplomacy is quite confusing, it isn't really clear and it should be like the one in Making History:The Great War. Apart from that, it's perfect.			"

												At the beginning of the movie ""Patton"" General Patton tells his soldiers that when a soldier's future grandchild asks him what he did in WWII he won't have to say he shoveled [organic fertilizer] in Louisiana.No, but in Making History II you will do that before the war.It's not a put down, it's a warning.  This game begins as an econ sim.  And the game's publisher also makes educational software and it shows.I am happy I bought this game but it is not for everyone.  Gamers either love or hate econ sims.  I began playing as the USA starting in 1933.  My first order of business is to fix the economy.System requirements are low but the graphics are sharp and clear.  I have mixed feelings about the use of the swastika on Germany's flag; I don't know if any other game does that.  While negotiating a sale of surplus food to Germany that symbol was on the screen and it made me feel like I was making a deal with the devil.The UI is very efficient but only after a lot of practice.  I read the manual, read a few guides, and watched videos.  But I still had to play the game, fail, and start over.A great game but not for the impatient.			"

												Well, Finally i got around to playing a matach long enough --- the 38/100 score does not serve the game well although it wouldn't be much higher the 60/100 - game is stable and never crashed although a little glitchy once and a while - editing maps and campaigns is easy just a very poor setup hinders is full capabilities and quickness of editing unit counts or re-desingation of territories.  Graphics and animations of the units are cool although nothing spectacular, I bought it when it went on sale for $5.00 and I would suggest do the same and waiting for it to go on sale. Pros -Long grand games Massive unit countsconsconfusing and a lerning curve of a few hours			"

												I'd like to start off with just saying. I like this game in some ways and think it has a lot of cool things about it. I honestly have one major complaint. The game progresses turn by turn. I""m not saying turn based gameplay doesn't work ever or that it isn't a good idea. It's an interesting idea for a game like this, but personally I found myself having nothing to do each turn after a point and just clicking end turn over and over again trying to finish building factories or other production which I need for the war. As a more minor but still somewhat significant complaint is that it seems like after a point combat becomes kind of confusing and muddled especially when the actual world war starts. I actually like a number of things about how industry and politics work. It is a lot like Hearts of Iron 3. Which I would tend to recommend more. Making History II: War of the World can get kind of slow and aggrevating with a turn based rather than real time system. I would also say the combat in Hearts of Iron is less confusing once you get past the immediate confusion I've heard some players have with it's battle mechanics. I'm sorry if that got a bit muddled. In closing. This is a ok game with some flaws to it which make me not able to really recommend this, it's predeccesor or sequel since they all seem to share the core gameplay without significant changes. I'm not saying they need to develop a direct clone of Hearts of Iron or any other game. But am saying a turn based grand strategy game is interesting, but probably as it turns out not the most efficent way to progress in one. When I purchased this I didn't know about Paradox Interactives grand strategy games and I would recommend someone who thinks this game looks interesting to first check out their cataloge. Shop around.POSITIVE+ A nice industrial system+ A long tech tree+ A scenario editorNEGATIVE- - -Turn based system makes the game kind of sluggish It's the main reason I don't play it anymore- - Combat isn't great			"

												Reviews over this game seem to be split between those who hate it and those who love it. I am now part of the latter group, albeit it did take a bit of getting used to. Pretty much everything the negative crew mentioned is true, I just find it is not as bad as they make it out to be. On the other hand the game is a LOT of fun to play. If you are coming from playing HoI like I did you need to get used to that there is very limited historical accuracy in this game. If you want Austria to join Germany you have to attack them. Alliances take weird turns in this ""anything goes"" game. And the game engine is a bit quick in starting rebellions. The first time I tried the game, by '38 not only had the UK lost most of her colonies (not that I minded playing Germany) the UK itself had fallen appart into: UK, England, Wales, Scotland and Fascist UK...I think the turn based gameplay makes it more playable than HoI, as does the fact that there are far fewer provinces to keep track of. The way the game is set up you can also play historically minor countries and turn them into world powers.If you are looking for historic accuracy, stick with HoI.But if you want a fun game where anything goes, give this one a try.It is the end of 1938. After completing a mega-industrialization in Germany I attacked and annexed Austria, Czechoslovakia, Danzig and Poland Japan had requested to join my alliance after I took Austria. While fighting Poland first France and allies (Netherlands, and some others). And then the UK and allies (including US and Canada and a few more) declared war on me. While I punch through the Maginot line in a titanic battle against numerous but ill equipped French forces the UK alliance declares war on the French alliance as well as on the USSR - I liked it already!France sues for peace offering me to keep the two maginot line provinces as part of the deal. I accept.Next round I offer them and the Soviets to join me. They both agree. Meanwhile Italy (the third most powerful nation on earth) refuses as they do not wish to get involved in my war against the UK. Hungary also refuses for the same reason. I secure full military access through France and the Netherlands (and now help protect their airspace with my fighters while I bomb London; and I offer partial military access to the Soviets (opening my ports to them)1939 promises to be interesting as I frantically try to build up my navy and an invasion force to take the war to the Brits...Literally anything goes in this game. And that alone makes it more than worth while.  "

However I have to mention that it gives even more strategic possibilities to the player than ''Total War"" ...like to establish new countries in conquered territories!

												Its a good game, more worth it if they lowered the price to about $14.99 since the orginol was a more fun and easier to understand game. Its Fun but takes a bit to learn, much more fun than hearts of iron since you can customize maps much easier without any big hassel. Combat is good for a turn based game and easy to control. In my opinion, the developers should have stuck with the first Making History layout while updating graphics and adding more things. The new one is a little too complicated and disorganized to compete with games such as hearts of iron. "

												I found this much more enjoyable than part 1, and also alot more fun and interesting, well done and thanks for a great simple war game devs.The best notable change in the game is the addition of experience for units, a must for any wargame, also, the game starts much earlier, meaning you have more time to build up a small nation to make it strong enough to contribute. If i could ask for anything extra, it would be for the possibility to exchange military units and technology on the diplomacy section. A good example of this would be the British trade with USA for destroyers to fight the atlantic war in exchange for war technology, making this a possibility would grant the small nations an even bigger chance to grow fast.All in all, a good fun game that doesnt hurt your wallet, i would reccomend to any airchair general.

												If the interface weren't 100% clicking this game could easily be much much much more recommendable from me.The overall menus do take some getting used to as the information you're required to be familiar with is staggering.The research tree button is absoultely useless as a ""quick key"" for the bottom right (unless you need to look at what you should be researching next).The news paper thing at the beginning of every turn is TEDIOUS and even after figuring out how to click the star in the top right of the newspaper to simple close all of them by that point I knew that the turnly update was useless since all of the information is avialable on the quick links in the top right.Honestly, my biggest complaint is the interface, it has to be the single least user friendly interface I've used in a strategy game.When turns are taking me more than 5 minutes even once familiar with navigating the menus (to do what should take around 1 minute) it's a real turn off for replayability.

That being said it turns out I probably should've opted for something else. It is exceedingly difficult to sustain any large scale attacks without leaving huge numbers of defenders behind to guard your flanks. Also combined arms armies seem to mean nothing. Finally I researched and built nuclear bombs then found no way to use them huge waste. Over all I was very dissappointed in this game.			"

												I'm recently getting into this game.  I like the civilization development issues similar to Civilization series.  But the fighting is more reealistic because it make take a few turns to capture a region unless you bring overwhelming force.			"

												I wouldn't recommend this game because it's still in ALPHA phase. It's buggy, the game moves very slowly ( in terms of frame-rate [ 16 or so on a rig that gets me 60+ in most current games at the best settings running 1920x1080 resolution ] ), the combat is horendous and half the time you can't order your troops to attack ( only move )...""Long Range"" Attacks ( such as the nuke ) means the launcher needs to be NEXT TO THE TARGET ( one block ).Before you buy, please look at GAMEPLAY videos to see this bad game in action before buying; do not buy at full price ( if you can find it at a bundle site such as H or IG I'd still recommend staying away ).

It has got this balance better than anything similar that I have played (I am looking at you Hearts of Iron IV).And it is really easy to mod.			"

The first game, everything was simple and you could figure it out on your own... this game is death by a thousand cuts because of the extreme amoung of mircomanaging and unclear ways of how to do things.

I've played Sweden, Germany, and am longing to finish my current game to only try out a new country.I highly highly highly recommend this game.

I am surprised to see the sale of this game to be so low. For how great of a game it is I really thought that this would be giving more competition to so many other titles such as Company of Heros, Total war and Men of War. The one con about this game would have to be is that it does not have a tutorial so learning how everything works just takes time experimenting with options. The pros definatly overwhelm the con and it is a great buy on steam.			"

Most intelligently crafter, it is better than its nieche competitor by a long shot (due respect granted to the latter and keeping hopes up for their next title in the series). Although the interface could use quite some more work, you can tell the priorities in UI features were very well made, so it's never really comfortable, but you know you have the most important stuff at hand (but seriously guys, some more linking of items to help and help in general is required).All and all, a thoroughly addictive, insanely fun game if you're a fan of the genre.

												The best part about this game is the fact that it's really the only WWII turn based strategy out there. For the history buff that likes to think about what would happen in different scenarios around WWII, this is your game. Enacting various scenarious keeps me coming back for more. MHII isn't without its' shortcomings though. An often clunky and click-happy interface makes games last forever and requires more micromanagement than I'd like.

												     I'm a bit mixed on this game. On one hand it does things better than the first game, most of them in the editor aspect. I'm going to start with the good. First off, the editor doesn't take 4 billion years to make big countries. Plus the editor UI is much more expansive and easy to use. Plus there is more diplomatic options. As in the first game there is not much in that aspect.     Now theres the bad. (It gets real!) So, I've got a lot of gripes with this game, first! One of the world's worst UI's ever! It's is so complcated, it takes like 1,000 clicks just to move units. Plus most of the time you accidently bring up the region menu when you try to move! The UI is  overly-complcated like TRADEING! Tradeing with almost 80 hours on, I still can't properly trade. It's not the click and go like the first game was. Now you have to look at this big♥♥♥♥♥ list of all the needs and excesses of the worlds countries, then you go and select the country and then propose a offer and then there is a 50/50 chance the country will accept or decline. This problem is intesifies as there is a lack of a tutorial to ease new players into it.     In summary, I believe that the first game is superior, even though the editor of the number 1 is inferior it's much simpler. Plus it's easier to use and it has a tutorial. Plus there is less lag! Lag happens every time I end a turn my computer has a massive lag spike. A lot of the good that number 2 does massively out weighed by the bad. Making History II: The War of the World Gets a 5/10 it's not worth your $15 if this was the first in the seies it would have gotten a much higher score. But when compared to the first it's nothing. I don't have the third yet but I have played the demo and even the demo From a gameplay stand point it's better. MHII:TWW is worth $8 - $10 at best however the $10 that's for the first game is out for, the game is worth about $25 - $30			"

												I must say that this game is near and dear to my heart. It's certainly no Hearts of Iron or Civilization, but it's certainly not a bad game either. If you enjoy turn based strategy and would like a simple ""conquer the world"" type game, this is definitely worthy of your consideration.Having played the original game in the series and playing this one since pre-order beta in 2010, I can say that it definitely has a simplistic appeal to it. Build unit in a city, send it into battle, take the world. This is essentially the board game Axis and Allies with the computer doing all the work for you. It bridges the gap between Civilization and much more intense grand-strategy games like those by Paradox Interactive. It also runs on lower-end PCs which is a plus, althought be warned that at turn 1000+ (1950s) the time between turns will increase significantly.A few positives:-Simplest grand strategy game that covers WWII-The game is easy to learn within an hour of playtime-Research is straightforward-Almost no game is historically correct, the AI decides when and if it wants to go to war. Some sort of WWII will always happen, howeverA few cons:-Not the smartest AI-Trade system experiences weird fluctuations late-game-Long time in between turns starting in the late 1940s-Combat is entirely based off total combat power and the terrain modifierOverall a great game for those looking for a simple grand strategy game set in WWII			"

												If you are one of those people who enjoy history and want to tweak it the way you want, this game is perfect.it is complicated enough that you have to plan in advance you research, production and army, but is simplistic enough you dont get the crusader kings problem of havig no idea what ur doing until you country gets invaded outta nowhere and you lose.i got this game for my birthday, and have never had a moment i do not regret installing it. i highly recomend if you have a brother (or sister!) or friend to hop in and play two nations, buildign a dual empire!i started playing this game as major powers, germany, USSR and america, and to be honest, it was almost too easy, even on 10 difficulty, as nobody else builds early production, so when war starts you have a serious factory advantage and can spam troops. you can also bully all your neighbours (unless your germany) without others stopping you.i find this game is funner as minor nations, that still have expansion potential, specifically brazil and argentina. South america is one of teh few regions with little presence from one of teh major powers, with euroep being a mess of embargoes and war if you attack a neighbour, and africa and asia belonging nearly all to one of the top 5.in the case of these two nations, you are sufficiently powerful enough to easily take neighbours, but need t eb careful of eahother, too much aggression and teh argo-brazil war begins, of which both teams can win, even though brazil has a slight advantage in number of cities and manpower. too much expansion too early can lead america to eb a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but if germany is already losign its mind and declaring war on bhutan and that then they tend to distract all the powers and you get away with conquering all of south america for free.with this base, you can use the research and manpower to build up your nation, and join the war late on the winning side for terriorial advances overseas.my personal favourite of the two is argentina, as their troops have a coler lookign model, but its up to you!P.S. if you want a serious challenge, play danzig in 1939 and try not to get annihilated by germany 10 turns in :)			"

Until now, could never find a war simulator that was accesable (i.e. not a huge learning curve, or too much micro-management). I am hooked as this game has huge replayability. I've played Sweden, Germany, and am longing to finish my current game to only try out a new country.I highly highly highly recommend this game. Will eventually buy The Great War, and hopefully a modern day sim from these guys with an ETA 2016!			"

												I strongly recommend the first version of this game, MH:I, over this one.  I can only imagine a complete change of staff, plus the loss of the source code, to stop development of MH:I and instead 'revamp' everything to make is a slower, more tedious game, with not much to recommend.

												It had a lot of detail, but the economy seemed screwed up.  I was playing as the USSR and by about turn 100 I was fully self sufficient without any need for trade, and by about halfway through the game I was well on my way to building a nuke, for 1942.  The reports from other regions were sparce, so I only found out several turns later that my eastern territories had been overrun ... and some of my units were completely wiped out by bombers, despite jet fighter cover.

												I must say that this game is near and dear to my heart. It's certainly no Hearts of Iron or Civilization, but it's certainly not a bad game either. If you enjoy turn based strategy and would like a simple ""conquer the world"" type game, this is definitely worthy of your consideration.Having played the original game in the series and playing this one since pre-order beta in 2010, I can say that it definitely has a simplistic appeal to it. Build unit in a city, send it into battle, take the world. This is essentially the board game Axis and Allies with the computer doing all the work for you. It bridges the gap between Civilization and much more intense grand-strategy games like those by Paradox Interactive. It also runs on lower-end PCs which is a plus, althought be warned that at turn 1000+ (1950s) the time between turns will increase significantly.A few positives:-Simplest grand strategy game that covers WWII-The game is easy to learn within an hour of playtime-Research is straightforward-Almost no game is historically correct, the AI decides when and if it wants to go to war. Some sort of WWII will always happen, howeverA few cons:-Not the smartest AI-Trade system experiences weird fluctuations late-game-Long time in between turns starting in the late 1940s-Combat is entirely based off total combat power and the terrain modifierOverall a great game for those looking for a simple grand strategy game set in WWII			"

												This game isn't a horrible game. But it isnt the best one. I have only played a couple Making History games and I think the best one is Making History: The Calm and the Storm. Get that one it is not only cheaper but is alot better in my opinion.			"

												This is my favorite game on Steam. If you love a game where you can play as a world power or an underdog country and become a world power then this is the game for you. I have put in 200hrs and I am not even close to being sick of it. If anything, I want to play it more			"
