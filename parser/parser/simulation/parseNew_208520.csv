												tl;dr version:PROS:+ Easy to learn, not that hard to master+ Authentic language, music and scenery+ Functionally combines Economy Sim and Round-Based Combat+ ""Sandbox"" Mode where you can check out tactics you didn't try in the campaign+ Fine-tune your henchmen and their weaponry by leveling them up and finding new firearms+ All weapon classes (Revolver, Pistol, Knife, Baseball Bat,...) have their own playstyle and useful+ All STATS (Strength, Endurance,...) are useful and you can reset PERKS for your player/henchmen easily+ All characters unlock widely varied combat-specific SKILLS which if properly used give a BIG advantage in combat+ Multi-Player with Henchman Level Progression+ Skills, STATS and Perks and the ability to switch out your gang on the fly helps to vary gameplay CONS:- Average economy system will be too easy and simple for above average sim fans- Turn based combat can be a bit infurating (Hit chances, friendly fire, damage stats,..)- Playing too many hours in a row will show how repetetive the gameplay can get- Co-Operative Mode is restricted to 2 modes of the Turn Based Combat, no co-op campaign with economy map!!- After 10 hours you have may have heard and seen everything that exists in the game- You might think that some henchmen are better than othersDLC WORTH IT?Yes if you get it all cheap at once, each DLC (not counting ADDON!) adds 1 mission and 1 henchman but on their own not worth 5 bucks.SUMMARY: Definitely buy if you want a fun and not too deep eco-sim/turnbased hybrid and feel a bit like ""Boardwalk Empire"" or other Prohibition-related media.   Great game, just not perfect but one can forgive the weak spots.Long Text: A fun little niché title that combines economy simulation with round-based combat in a meaningful way. By no means the most deep and realistic simulation of the Prohibition Era but it manages to capture the atmosphere through authentic, if sometimes comical, voice bits, great and fitting music and general flair.Neither combat nor economy sections of the game work perfectly but work seamlessly together but it can get repetetive.Multi-Player  is PvP (vs other players and their gangsters) and  2 Co-operative missions. You can only play the turn-based combat but you can build your gang out of the game's henchman list, level and equip them according to your preferences (and what you can afford).It IS a fun game that draws you in with its charm, easy to use and understand controls and mechanics, quick action and original maps based on Atlantic City.It is NOT a hardcore economy sim with deep layers of mechanics nor a high-tech combat simulator.You are limited to the ingame ressources and will most likely figure out the most efficient way to play about midway through the 10-15 hour campaign and slight repetivity might sour your experience.

												Omerta is not a terrible game, and I'm almost inclined to give it a thumbs up. Heck, I spent 30+ hours playing it, so you might think that's an implicit recommendation right there. But it's not.There's enough going on in Omerta to keep you occupied in a pleasant, cow-clicker kind of way. But the strategic/RTS layer lacks enough depth to be really satisfying - every mission plays out in pretty much the same way, tilting from ""how long do I have to wait until my next building? I hope I don't run out of money"" over to ""I'm printing money and the police are in my pocket"" in about 10-15 minutes each time.The tactical combat is pretty fun, but unlike XCOM EU, you don't feel like you're really making many interesting choices in the team construction. I've carefully balanced my squads between AoE shotgun-types and single-target pistol/rifleman. I've also just thrown a bunch of characters in with the best-rated weapons that happen to be in my inventory. Either way you'll find a way to win without too much sweat. So leveling up gang members and choosing their skills/perks becomes a forgettable side note, not the kind oi high-stakes, nailbiter moment it should.I picked up Omerta as part of a Humble Bundle so I'm plenty happy with the purchase. If I'd dropped north of $10 on this, though, I'd feel cheated. Omerta has some nice production values, but the gameplay is a lot more like a Facebook/casual game than a real AAA title.			"

												Actually, that is very controversial game to be recommended...On the one hand, it's a quite attractive mix of city management game (like Tropico series) and tactical combat game (like XCOM or Silent Storm).On the other hand attempt to mix these two features can't be called successfull because:- management part much easier than in Tropico and not so absorbing:- tactical combat part can entertain you but it's far-far behind XCOM or Silent Storm:In other words, if you have an opportunity to buy it on sale for 5-10 USD (with all DLC) then do it - worths it completely. If it's much more expensive, it's simply waste of time and money.			"

												I love gangster settings, but this game has oen massive problem.It's boring.You will sit on the map waiting for resources to unlock so you can continue plugging away with the game. Want to break up the monotany with combat missions? You'll be punished with a raised alert status with the cops. It goes too high and the game is over.Unless you have money to bribe, in which case it's never a concern.And sadly the combat missions feel random. The difference between everybody living and everybody dying can sometimes just feel like a random dice roll, even after playing the entire mission smart.To add insult to injury I still don't know how to change the weapons my crew is carrying. And I'm ten hours in.There's a lot of potential but it just doesn't live up to any of it.I won't begrudge anybody who likes this game, but this game just wasn't for me.			"

												It is a single-player monopoly.The main problem with the game isn't the poor combat or the fact that there's no point in strategically building your buildings for one purpose or another.The core problem is that you can't lose.There is no competition trying to compete for the same areas that you are. Imagine a strategy game in the style of Starcraft where you find a set of minerals but there's no point in rushing to build there because no one else will take it. As a matter of fact, there is no point in building bunkers or base defences either, because the only time you will get attacked it will be scripted.Additionally the multiplayer is a joke. It only allows you to do a small number of pre-created missions. There were gangster games made over ten years ago that have higher quality than this!The only good thing I can say about this game is that it has a good atmosphere. Worth 20 Euros? No, absolutely not.			"

												This is one of those games that takes a good idea, in this case running a mafia gang in 1920's Atlantic City, but just doesn't deliver on its potential. Each level is set in a different neighbourhood of Atlantic City. You have an overview of that neighbourhood where you can rent or buy buildings and establish illegal or legit businesses or joints.  There's also some squad based tactical combat where you control some of your hired gangsters as they fight rival gangs or cops. Good points:- the games style is pretty good with nice looking maps that pull of the 1920's look quite nicely. The music also adds nicely to the games atmosphere.-running your own mafia gang is pretty fun for the first few hours at least Bad points:- this game gets very repetitive after a few levels. The basic formula for each level is start setting up businesses, discover more of the neighbourhood, set up more businesses, gather enough money, resources or liked rating to complete objectives, combat mission end. While the campaign has a story and objectives that try to keep things fresh is doesnt stop the repetition creeping in and the game becomes a chore.- the combat sections arent great. Granted its not the gameplays main focus but it doesnt have much depth and combat sections become more of a nuisance later in the game.I've ticked not recommended for this game instead of recommended  but it's really one of those ""somewhere in the middle"" games. It's not so much a bad game but it's not good either, just average. If the game sounds like something you'd enjoy it might be worth a try but probably not worth it otherwise.			"

""REAL BOSS AIN'T SCARED OF DIRTY JOB""I can't help myself but when I'm looking at Omerta - City of Gangsters I see that legendary game called Chicago 1930. Is it atmosphere? Top-down camera? Visuals? Gameplay experience? Most probably one of each. Anyway, Omerta is coming from creators of popular series Tropico and yes, we can feel their signature over here.It's been said many times and I have to say it too. This game features two basic elements which aren't near their maximum potential. One is combat system and second is economy and managment. Both of them are important part of game. Thing is, or let's say speculation, that if Omerta's main element was either combat or economy & managment made to its maximum it'd be truly awesome creation. But it is what it is. We have two features that are not reaching their top and they're not created the best way they could be.I've liked that turn-based combat system I must admit, it was more gripping than I've expected. Fights are mediocre, sometimes too easy and sometimes pain in the butt. However fact is that AI is terrible. Rival gangs in combat and outside are really bad. Some just run straight to you where you have 4 of your soldiers so you can kill them with ease. Every member of your team have its own bonus, and each is good at something so you can plan out some strategy or think in advance. You can upgrade them, deploy them, release them, they're all yours. The economy & managment will be kinda average for players that came here from Tropico series. It's like its weaker brother. But it's fun for a while. Building your imperium and taking over cities of America, starting from scratch and reach the top. You can set up different buildings to work for you, you can upgrade them, raise their efficiency, you can buy out joints, frame other gangs, heist their warehouses, bribe officials, steal cars, and much much more and it might be pleasurable for few hours.Game will last you around 20 hours and less, MP or CO-OP is not helping that much. Every DLC except Japanese Incentive will give you just one level so it's not really great deal as you can imagine. But Japanese Incentive will give you 12 so it can boost up your gameplay time by 8/9 hours easily, but in the end it's just how you play it, fast or enjoyable. Hours may vary.Game can run pretty smooth even on old machines, it doesn't really look that well and sound is not great too either. It all depends on how you feel with the game, but chances are it will get repetetive after 3/4 levels. When you upgrade your mansion to the max, and go to new level, guess what, your mansion is gone. So as I said you're starting from scratch. Both combat and economy is not deep at all, half of potential for both is used. It's not that bad and it's not really good either. Solid average maybe little bit above. With the Demo available you can try it out yourself before spending money. /Short bullsh*t talk (I don't even want to call it review) about Japanese Incentive DLC is here: https://steamcommunity.com/id/fo_ruM/recommended/215374/Bonus Point: Demo AvailableRating: 6/10 "

												This is one of the games where I'd like to have an option in between recommended and not recommended.It fully deserves a ""Meh."" and that's just what I'm gonna give it.So I am not saying that you shouldn't get it, neither that you should.The idea and setting are nice and the game is fun in the beginning, but gameplay just remains absolutely the same all the way through.Step one: Let's build a mafia business with illegal alcohol and stuffStep two: Oh look, the (other) bad guys! Let's kill all of them.Step three: Congrats, you win! Now go the next place.Over and over and over and over and over.The economics are extremely simple and the whole game is very repetitive. That doesn't mean it isn't fun for a few hours, but finishing it is one of those things life is just simply too short for. I lost interest somewhere on the way.tl:dr: Meh game, fun for a few hours, getting it on sale may be worth it, but you probably won't finish it.			"

												I bought this game for a quick weekend play, thinking it would be an interesting pastime that I'd binge-play once or twice and then never touch again. Boy was I wrong: Omerta sucked me in with its huge campaign, awesome mechanics, cool characters and absolutely amazing soundtrack. Seriously, the soundtrack is among the greatest Jazz/Swing stuff I have ever heard, and I listen to that type of music regularly. If you like the idea of being a prohibition-era gangster and don't mind not having Mass Effect-level cutscenes (this game does not have ANY real cutscenes, just quick montages) and buy and sell on a city-spanning market of beer, liquor and guns, this game is absolutely for you.Also, it has a DLC-campaign that is roughly the same length as the original one, and I have not even played through half of it. So buy this game, especially if it is on sale, because it really is worth your hard earned clean money.			"

												I don't like to berate games for nit picky reasons, but I really didn't enjoy Omerta for nit picky reasons. Omerta uses a turn-based combat systerm (like Heroes of Might Magic), combined with a free market economic environment (like Patrician, or any of the Impression city games) and has a ""take over the world through back alley means"" main goal (like Grand Theft Auto or Tropico). It begins with you making a ""custom"" character (you pick one of six portraits, his starting weapon and his stats). After that, your story picks up and you go from immigrant to booze king of New York during the Prohibition. Typical gameplay involves sending one of your six on hand gang members (all of which are preselected) to buy one of three main commodities in the game (beer, liquor or guns), steal any of the commodities, sell any of the commodities, establish a property that deals with any of these things, or just accumulates money. Every now and then, you will need to go into a combat mission, which involves you picking four (and only four) of your six gang members. Each character does have their own special weapons and talents (healing abilities, morale boosting abilities, etc.) and you get to plan out the assault/raid/assassination. Here are the reasons I didn't like this game: 1.) They don't let you customize the main character as much as, say, Baldur's Gate, nor do they let you make custom characters to bring into the game (like Freedom Force). 2.) the learning curve is horizontal until the very, VERY last mission. Then it becomes vertical. In other words, I ended up rage quitting over how easy and not challenging everything was after they decided to make the last mission 20x harder than the previous missions. 3.) You are given a multiplayer option that nobody uses (pay $40 for this game or nothing for TF2, Planetside, Dota 2, or Tribes: Ascend?). 4.) This game was very cheaply made, and that's coming from a guy who still will play Heroes of Might and Magic 4, Zeus: Master of Olympus and other cheaply made strategy games. There are spelling/ grammar errors everywhere, the jokes they make in this game are dumb and the voice acting quality leaves me wondering if the white guy sniper is actually black, or if the drunken irish doctor is actually Italian. 5.) There is absolutely no replay value and very restricted freedom in the game. After you beat the campaign (and the dlc, if you REALLY think that's a sound investment), you have an open sandbox mode (which isn't bad, to be fair) and the aforementioned multiplayer mode. Considering that Kalypso made this (yes, the people who made Tropico made this crap), I was disappointed with the fact that I couldn't just put a hit on random people (random buildings, yes, random people (Mike Hodges, etc) no). While Kalypso is doing everything to always add content and fix bugs, it simply isn't worth the price. For $40, buy XCOM or the newest Tropico. For $5.99 or less, go to GOG.com and you'll find several quality strategy games that trump this little thing.			"

												After playing total of ~30 hours and in fact finishing the game with every unique weapon, unfortunately I don't recommend this title.Let's start from the good side. You have very nice voice-acting, awesome graphics (especially rain visuals on street is pretty damn good, I liked that), and... yeah, that's it.For some reason I couldn't find more pros. It's a very simple mix of strategy and RPG, with turn-based combat. Gameplay is pretty damn boring, it takes some time in every mission to ""settle up"" and make a good income, only to discover that 5 minutes later mission is finished... And you start again...Actually there's no real reason for ""having fun"" with doing anything apart from main storyline. The only things, which are permanent are the weapons, and most of them are useless anyway.I won't lie if I say that I had higher hopes for this title. I love Tropicos and got this game as a preorder special to Tropico 5, and decided that I can play it a bit before Tropico 5 arrives, but no. Game is unfortunately boring, repeatable, very short (you can finish it with collecting most of the achievements under 20 hours, on normal gameplay it's about 10-15 hours I'd say), and doesn't really offer ANYTHING, which could potentially hold me for a bit longer.Sorry Kalypso, but Omerta isn't your strongest title. Adding more RPG elements like taking 1/10 or even less of daily income to the next mission would make it far more enjoyable. There's no real reason for making anything apart from storyline, and perhaps collecting some interesting weapons, but even this is pretty optional. I had higher hopes for this game and I was sure that it will be similar as with Tropico - I start playing and it forces me to finish every damn mission, only because it's that good game. In this case, I had to force myself to finish this game, and it's unlikely that I'll launch this game ever again.			"

												Omerta — a code of silence that forbids Mafia members from cooperating with authorities and revealing information about their criminal activities.Sharing its name with the famous code, Omerta: City of Gangsters is a management simulation and turn-based tactical combat game set in prohibition-era Atlantic City that follows the activities of a newly-established mob boss.Atlantic City consists of 20 maps and each has a role to play in the overall campaign. At the start of a new chapter you get to pick which map to play on by choosing a mission. Missions have different rewards attached to them such as a level-up for your henchmen, special weapons or an increase in team size. Then the game zooms in on the streets on the map and drops you into what could be considered to be the primary melting pot of the game’s many aspects; the strategic level.Here you rent and buy properties in which you can set up both legal and illegal businesses. Character creation is reminiscent of classic turn-based RPGs like Fallout or Baldur’s Gate, but in a mobster setting. Rather than just assign points to your attributes — Muscle, Finesse, Smarts, Cunning, Guts, and Toughness — you select four or so out of a dozen options that establish your character’s aptitudes.Omerta’s turn-based combat feels like the generic brand version of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, lacking any cinematic flair and seeming no more evolved than the turn-based strategy titles from the ’90s, with a cover system that feels ambiguous at best and arbitrary at worst. Sometimes you fight mobsters, sometimes you fight cops, and sometimes you fight KKK members, but there’s little nuance to be had in your approach to dealing with these foes. To Omerta’s credit, you can often skip combat with an “auto-resolve” option.What Omerta does best is capture the charm of the 1920s, from the soundtrack’s smooth jazz tunes, to the accents of the colorful characters, to the aesthetics of period city districts and vehicles. Omerta even touches on the themes of racism and sexism, issues that plagued society in those days, without being offensive or irreverent, and without taking the easy way out by ignoring them altogether.Omerta is a great game which quite successfully mixes economic management with tactical turn based combat in a well-made mobster setting.

												For those old enough to remember, there was once a pretty decent game called Gangsters 2: Vendetta - a game where you could hire gangsters, buy them weapons, cars, muscle (IE - bodyguards), direct them to whatever point on the map you needed them to be, attack rival gangs and their businesses, take over their territory, set up legit businesses, set up illegal businesses, protect your businesses from rivals, all whilst staying hidden from the law.Now imagine if someone had taken all that, thrown it out of the window, and replaced it with a gangster themed boardgame of Monopoly. Because thats all this is, every mission - buy a fake business, create a speakeasy to sell booze, make money, win level. The cops or rival gangs never barge in on your operations, and if you DO somehow get the cops attention (perhaps by murdering a few people in a boredom induced rage), slip em a few hundred dollars and they'll forget all about the corpses they've just discovered.Its a sad state of affairs when I can genuinely say that a 16 year old game beats this into the ground.

												Great atmosphere game, which transports you into the 1920's Atlantic City and lets you climb the crime ladder in the turbulent times of the Prohibition. Always start with the positive:+ Graphics are neat, even on my laptop I can run high end settings.+ Pictures and 2D art are amazing+ Decoration and attention to detail bring this world to life.+ Great jazz music form the era+ Superb voice acting+ Turn-based combat (think the 90's Fallout 1&2)+ Jobs are varied and dynamic, some provoke armed confrontations.+ Useful skills and perks.+ Character creation based on background, can make interesting bosses.+ Because your gang members are such memorable characters you can get an emotional attachment to them like in X-Com or Darkest Dungeon (with much lower mortality rates than those two games).Although:- Missions require you to restart building your empire in each neighborhood.- Story can be completed rather quickly once you get the hang of the game.- Because it is all scripted, there is little replayability value (even though I still did a second playthrough and some free-mode as well).- Leveling up is scripted.Overall, the game is really fun for awhile and if you love the era it's a must have. Otherwise pick this up on sale (reg. price is only 20$, 10 makes it a steal)Thumbs up!			"

I was expecting it to _at least_ be on par with 'Gangsters: Organized Crime' which was released in 1998 (i think?). It really felt like the developers focused more on the visual and auditory effects of the game, rather than focusing on depth of in-game mechanics. The game gets pretty boring after a couple hours of playing. I wouldn't recommend buying this, unless it was on sale...			"

												This game is one small design change away from enjoyable for me.  Currently action points and movement points are separate.  That means that there is really no such thing as a good defensive position, because sucidally aggressive AI who outnumber you on every mission 3-4 to one are going to run up and hit you with a pipe wrench from out of sight before you can stop them.  Even if they only get one hit, that's one foot into the grave for that guy.The devs chose to greatly simplify tactics so there's not really any good overwatch, no defensive positions and the tactics are very sloppy unless the AI does super dumb stuff like stop in the doorway.Also - and this is a minor gripe - the gaim's main enemy are KKK members.  I don't love the KKK any more than the next guy, but it feels stupid.  Since when is the KKK running around with submachine guns fighting the mafia?  I feel like this is a clumsy grab and making you feel like you're the good guy.FFS you're a gangster.  Do we have to sanitize and white hat everything?   "

												Omerta - City of Gangsters is a strategic simulation that puts you in the shoes of a small-time mafia don running a very small outfit during the height of Prohibition. The game is reminiscent of Gangsters 2 and Gangland, utilizing similar economic and battle mechanics, but lacking some of the depth and scope of the older games. The gameplay is divided amongst ""levels,"" neighborhoods of a city in which a specific mission must be accomplished to continue to the next. Most of the missions are relatively straightforward and do not require a great deal of strategy to accomplish. The battle mechanics are also somewhat clunky and unrealistic, and is by far the most challenging aspect of the game due to the limitations. When the mission is completed, the level ends abruptly without an option to continue building your empire in that neighborhood. Sandbox mode offers more of a challenge, allowing you to set the police coverage to high and offering rival gangs that can quickly move in on your territory, take over your businesses, and attack your ""hideout."" The neighborhoods are rather small, however, and really restrict the scope this game could have.Despite the problems, however, this is the best organized crime strategy game that has hit the market since Gangland was released in 2004. It has been enjoyable for hours and I recommend purchasing it on sale.			"

												The game is a ""manage your criminal organization"" strategy game, with turn-based combat missions and a setting in 1920's Atlantic City.First of all, the mood and atmosphere is excellent.  The graphics and music are really good.  The voice-acting is fairly decent.  Although the story is rather stereotypical, it isn't bad by any means.About the gameplay, I like to compare it to Xcom Enemy Unknown, because they both combine  a management game with turn-based combat missions.  Xcom EU won several prices last year, including strategy game of the year, and got generally high reviews.From what I heard, the reason Omerta got bad criticism was mostly due to bugs and the management aspect being fairly simple.  Funny enough, I feel the same applies easily to Xcom EU: base management is totally simplified compared to classic Xcom, and multiplayer is so bugged it's hardly playable.  The difference is Xcom patches only seemed to scratch the surface, while I've recently played a lot of Omerta and haven't encountered a single bug.And what about the turn-based combat ?  Well, I actually prefer Omerta, I really feel they did a great job on that.  Especially ""line of sight"", which is a serious issue in XCom, is well executed in Omerta.  Everything also seems to be nicely balanced.  I'm not sure how active the multiplayer community is, I'm afraid it's pretty dead thanks to the bad publicity the game received.Bugs: no big issues I'm aware ofManagement part : fun, but pretty casual, not that much replay valueTurn-based strategy missions : excellentGangster setting : greatMaybe I'm biased because I really like both the genre (management + turn-based strategy) and the setting (gangsters).  So it probably depends what you're looking for.  Biggest issue seems to me the limited replay value. "

												A combination of business management and tactical turn-based combat, Omerta - City of Gangsters will scratch your Mafia itch like you wouldn't believe.  The atmosphere is absolutely incredible and you feel like you've hopped into a time machine and traveled back to the 20's.  The single-player story was far deeper and more enjoyable than I had first expected it to be.  You create your character by answering about half a dozen questions regarding their past and begin play at about the time they step off of the boat in the United States.  From then on, you begin to form connections, set up (or extort) little businesses (some legitimate, others as fronts for the illegal activity taking place within), rob banks, chase off other gangs, etc.  All of this takes place while an overarching storyline with several twists and turns plays out along the way.The business management side of the game is entertaining, and simple enough to learn quickly without a significant time investment.  On each map there are dozens of lots that can be built on (if there isn't already a building there), purchased, taken over, or firebombed by your gang.  On these lots are everything from pizza shops to speakeasies to casinos to gun shops to smuggling rings, each with their own purpose and choice of upgrades.The combat aspect of the game is can most easily be compared to XCOM.  It's a turn-based tactical combat system that utilizes a variety of unit stats, skills, and equipment to engage in battles where a limitless number of approaches are possible.  Though you can only ever have six members of your gang working directly with you at any given time, every single member of your gang levels up at the same time - a massive convenience for those Dons who prefer to swap gang members in and out on the fly.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys tactical turn-based strategy, light business sims, and that Mafia-era Roaring Twenties setting.

												Nice theming, shallow gameplay. Every mission makes you start all over again, leading to repetitive and drawn-out gameplay. The combat sequences are nice, and can get pretty tense. Tactical play and thinking ahead is encouraged. Could not finish the game after starting the umpteenth mission and having to build everything up yet again. Overall impression is that the game feels like it was made five years ago. Recommended if you're watching Boardwalk Empire and jonesin' for a fix. Definitely a '6' or a '7' if you're into the period.			"

												It's like a mobster version of X-Com except that skill doesn't really get you far enough to not feel that you're completely at the mercy of RNG.  That is mixed with a turn based city builder that is somewhat fun, but really no depth to it.  It's like if Tropico was a facebook game, including the part where you just have to sit there and look at your screen until you accrue more resources to do the next thing you want to do.  Cover is completely broken, still. I really can't believe they're putting out DLC without fixing a horribly broken cover system.  Enemies shoot you through walls, barrels, objects etc. sometimes hitting on all 3 shots a turn even though your guy shouldn't even be visible in his current cover spot.  On the flip side, sometimes your character can't see someone who would be quite obviously visible if the situation were real.  I literally had an enemy stab me through a window, end his turn there, but then my man standing right outside the (ground floor) window couldn't see him...It still manages to be fun at times, which makes its complete failures more frustrating.  What gets me writing this review though, is the dishonesty of selling this game as ""75% off, down to $9.99 (USD)"" This game is nowhere. freaking. close. to a $40 game.  This is one of those bargain bin games that doesn't realize it should be selling at $10 on a normal day at this point, been out for a long time, no buzz generated, deservedly poor metacritic reviews.  So ok, if I mark up a turd by 10 times what it's worth, and then discount it to twice what it's worth, is that a deal? Anyway, wait till it drops down to proper turd prices.  Pay $5 for this game, tops.			"

""A real boss ain't afraid of grunt work."" - The BossYou'd better not be either if you want to play Haemimont Games' Omerta - City of Gangsters, since it'll sometimes feel like just that.  This barely ekes out a thumbs up review; my impressions were mostly negative in the first few hours, but it's one of those games that gets better once you know the ropes.Omerta features a mix of strategy, sim and RPG gameplay with resource/city management occurring on a main map and turn-based combat on individual, smaller maps.  The setting is cool: Atlantic City, New Jersey during the 1920's-30's Prohibition era with a thematic focus on American crime lords and their gangs.Four difficulty settings: Easy, Medium, Hard & Insane.  The last two I wouldn't bother with.  It's not fun losing a combat only to have your gangsters jailed (requiring another combat mission to spring them from the slammer).  Nor is it fun watching a rival gang slowly cover the map in red, taking over your properties along the way.  Easy difficulty on the other hand just isn't compelling since you'll run into long stretches of time with little or nothing to really do, waiting on jobs to finish or businesses to amass enough cash to accomplish your objective.  That said, Medium is the best bet, but even this doesn't feel particularly well balanced.  There will still be boring moments and frustrating ones too.  Give it a chance, though - with a few missions under your belt you'll know what to do & it'll grow more engaging.The turn-based combat mode, while not spectacular, is satisfying - once your crew is leveled up a bit and outfitted with better weapons, that is.  Initially it'll feel daunting and perhaps a bit clunky.  I enjoyed the RPG style character progression and had fun trying different lineups for combat.  It feels a bit arbitrary and overly difficult on anything higher than Medium.There are several changes I'd make to Omerta.  One is simply a quicksave/quickload function, another is the ability to remap all keys.  It'd be great if there were a game speed setting to fast forward while you're just waiting on income to generate.  A beef I have is that on leveling up, you only choose perks for the crew you have active on the map; remaining gangsters in your roster automatically have perks chosen.  It kind of forces you to stick with the same team of six over an entire campaign rather than being able to mix it up, as the AI doesn't always choose perks wisely.Visuals & audio are acceptable.  It looks slightly dated for 2013 but in my opinion captures the Prohibition look.  The soundtrack is fun & upbeat but quickly gets repetitive.Mechanics all functioned as intended.  I encountered only a couple of non game-breaking bugs; one hilarious bug worked in my favor, allowing my Hitman to finish jobs instantly: I took out a rival gang in under a minute on the map via Drive-By's.The game comes with cooperative & competitive multiplayer modes as well as a sandbox mode with a variety of maps; these I did not try.If you have the Gold Edition of Omerta, you also get a few DLC missions/characters which are fine, but more importantly The Japanese Incentive.  This DLC expansion is notable for extending the game's length greatly & introducing a big new mechanic: rival gangs.  You may notice during the main campaign (which you should definitely play first) a number of buildings & upgrades intended to work against enemies; these never actually get used until the expansion, and can be safely ignored until then.TJI adds a new layer to gameplay, requiring you to be busier with defending against & responding to enemy activity.  Key things to remember about this feature: ""Hire Goons,"" the $1,000 upgrade: Doesn't work well since it's high cost but protects against only a single attack on the upgraded business.  Attacks can come in quick succession & this upgrade should only be used on critical assets (like your Security Agency). Lookouts, Security Agency & Hit Squad: These are costly & thus difficult to acquire early on, but do the legwork for you when it comes to offense/defense.  Not having at least some of these while a rival gang is on the map can make life difficult.  The range on Lookouts is too small, however, and you should resign yourself to possibly losing some territory.  The Heat generated by going on the offensive & the monetary cost of replacing lost businesses hurt, so get a Security Agency and/or Hit Squad to cover these, unless you plan to eliminate your rival quickly. Uncover the map, fast: Time is a factor.  Be mindful of what's required to reveal new areas (including the enemy Hideout).  These interactions show up on the minimap as green X's and dots.  Need higher Feared rating to intimidate a shopkeeper into spilling the beans on his neighborhood?  Well, you should've built a Pizzeria (+Feared) instead of a Soup Kitchen (+Liked), huh.. Stock up on guns: Offense in most forms requires firearms, so get 'em when & where you can.There are different strategies for dealing with rival gangs.  The one that usually works for me is treating it like a race to uncover their Hideout, figure out how to make it vulnerable, then destroy.  That won't always be possible, in which case rely on the Security Agency, otherwise this feature which should be a welcome addition will seem like a hassle.At the end of my time with Omerta, I decided on a thumbs up review since I had fun despite the problems.  It's not often we get stuff with the mafia/mobster theme, either.  I recommend this game to any player drawn by the theme.  Anyone interested strictly in gameplay would do better sticking to more polished entries into the genre, such as XCOM: Enemy Unknown.  The Tips section of this review is particularly relevant, so check it out if you're going to play.TIP: (Investigations/Heat mechanic) To spare new players a bit of headache: police investigations trigger at 5 stars on the ""Heat"" meter, bottom right of screen.  This has to be dealt with, but ""Destroy the Evidence"" missions are not advisable without powerful gangsters.  Those are a last ditch measure for when alternative, easier options are unavailable.  Options like betraying other crooks, bribing cops, using businesses (Lawyer & Safe House), etcetera.TIP: (Character Class) Learn what effect each gangster type has and get a nice variety in your crew composition.  I prefer two Masterminds, two Hitmen, and Enforcer & a Grifter.  Hitmen don't raise Heat level on jobs, Masterminds do jobs faster, Burglars take more reward from theft, etcetera.  Use these to minimize heat, expand efficiently & ensure the mission proceeds smoothly.TIP: (Unique Weapons) Keep an eye out for weapon upgrade opportunities on the campaign map, as they significantly bolster combat effectiveness & enable you to take on tougher encounters with ease.  Unique weapons are the most costly & powerful in game (purple colored nametags).TIP: (Save Often) You can't back out of combat missions, so save frequently & be prepared for both scripted & unscripted encounters.  Be aware that enemy reinforcements can arrive behind your position in certain encounters, too.TIP: (Too Much Froth) Don't ever sell beer to the Rabbi; it will always have too much froth for that miser!  O'Connor will also frequently haggle & complain about shoddy merchandise if you sell him firearms.			"

												Amazing game... for about a day or two :-(. The first time playing through was very fun, but after I beat the game it was painfully boring to play again. Not really enough to do within the game to make it replayable. And, it does not take very long to beat... I played for about 2-4 hours a day, and it did not take me anymore than maybe four days MAX to beat it.However, I do recommend this game as it is pretty fun the first time you play.			"

The weapons are limited but feel solid for the time period.  The voice acting is funny and not too cheesy.  Character development is not too deep but gets the job done.  Overall it was a fun game and I enjoyed it!  I would recommend for fans of gangster games and the Tropico series!			"

												I'm going to have to recommend this one, overall.It's not as deep as some of the games of yesteryear (see: Gangsters - Organized Crime), but the scenarios are interesting and the building trees coupled with limited spaces make you really think about what kind of gangster you're going to be - loved, feared, or both. The turn-based combat portions are solid, but not fantastic. The storyline highlights various facets of life in the 20s, with some romanticism thrown in. There's a certain faction you run into early on that, I'll admit, is very satisfying to shoot in the face.The music is also too damn catchy.If you like the era and want a modern take on the whole gangster thing, grab this and the DLC. Especially if it's on sale.			"

												I bought the ""Gold Edition"" pack of this game in the sale at the end of last year. This is a turn-based game when doing the missions and choosing the right weapons for your team can mean the differences between success and failure. You can do many things in this game from buying assets to establish your businesses to doing trades with other criminals and bribing the authorities to turn a blind eye. Its a good linear-based storyline and has a decent reply value to the game. However it can be annoying with some of the auto-resolve in missions if you use it as I have lost battles despite the fact that the chance of success has been more than 75%. But in all honesty. If you like mob-based games like I do, then this is worth a try.			"

												Omerta might not be the greatest RTS there is, but it's one that's sort of addictive. In every mission you'll do the same things over and over, but somehow it remains fun and has that 'one more game' feeling. Until later on... Near the end of the game the AI becomes ridiculously precise during combat. Something that becomes even more frustrating when you're only metres away from your enemies and still miss every single shot. I must have played a mission like that for 10 times and still never made any progress. The game also autosaves before combat so loading a previous game will have you select your gangsters for combat, but there's no way to cancel this action. You will and must fight. What's the use of a savegame like this ? Because I surely don't know.Anyway, the graphics are sharp, and sometimes stylish, but mostly bland. Tthe music fits the genre and setting, and the sounds get the job done. It's all pretty decent.It's a very decent game, nothing special, but well worth the money because of its value (20+ hours of gameplay, and I paid something like €15 or so).[Rating: 75/100]			"

The interface is copy and pasted from tropico though which is a bit of a let down considering you are looking at it for 85% of the time. Dlc is pricey for what you get.... which is one extra mission and a bunch of weapons you end up replacing later on in the game.  "

												Omerta - City of Gangster is a mix of a couple of things fused togheter. The concept, the combat and the managing your empire. It has his own platform which you can log into and play with others, if the multiplayer wasn't dead, but there is still a sandbox mode to play aside of the story which is similar to it. You can choose one of the districts in the city and you can choose an objective to reach before the rival gang does, unless free to play, or you can always kill them just to be sure.The concept is as you didn't guess from the title nor the explenation beforehand a mafia game and I would say that the concept is similar to what we saw in the godfather. You start of as a Don that is working for another Don and you work your way up the ranks and finally becoming the Don of the city. As a Don you will encouter a lot of competitors and things that will make your life hard but showing your dominance will make them all back off. The game will definitly try its best to give you a very hard time even at the easiest difficulty. The music in the game is good, although it may seem repetitive, but it definitely fit the mafia theme with the jazz music. Not to mention the voices in the game which really gave the feeling that you were talking to gangsters. There are jokes in the game that pretty funny and reference other games. The managing system is similar to Tropico, at least from what I heard it did seem familiar to me somehow, but I'm not familar enough with Tropico to tell how much it is similar. You start off with dirty money and you can rent premesis or joints or constructions, with clean money, and build buildings that make dirty or clean money or make resources that you can sell like beer liquor or firearms. Obviously there is also an option to launder dirty into clean money. There is also a sort of market where you can buy and sell or ask favors from other mafioso. If the local businesses make you mad you can always raid them for resources or drive by them to kill them and make the building empty. If you get along you can buy the business if you want to. You can send out your henchmen or yourself out the district to undergo one of the actions in the map. A timer on the henchmen would be nice showing how much time there is needed until the action is complete.The combat is similar is to the XCOM series or the Expedition series which means it adds a strategic value to the game. You can send in 4 or 3 henchmen, rarely, and send one other henchmen on a support mission. This can vary to giving you sight on the combat map, acting as an assassin and shooting at the enemy from time to time, making them drunk and reducing movement, or bribing the cops to make them come later. Your henchmen can have melee weapons or ranged guns. You get movement points and attack points which you can use to kill the enemies in the map. What I like about the combat system is that you can play at least 4 characters every time instead of playing only the Don with AI backup. What I doubt sometimes is the percentages of when you can hit an enemy or miss. When you are behind cover and you see an enemy next to a box right in front of you the chance should be 80-90% that you hit them right? No, the chance is barely 50% which is pretty weird. Depending on  the mission type you sometimes get the losing condition if you didn't kill them all in x amount of turns which I think they could replace with reinforcements in x amount of turns. If you killed them in time you can escape easily but if not you have to face them and the reinforcements. If one of these aspects doesn't appeal to you you shouldn't pick this up but if you like one or two of them and you are curious about the last one you should try it. It really depends on preference here because it is an pretty long game and you will have to manage and will have to fight a lot in this game. If the mafia aspect appeals to you but not the other aspects I suggest you pick up The Godfather games instead, which are unfortunately not on steam.			"

												It is hard to say, as I am torn on this one. I would give it a 6 out of 10. If it is on sale, Pick it up, it is fun. But sadly, it gets old fast. There is barely too much for replayability - in fact, after the first few levels, you start noticing there is barely too much for advancement.First of all, I loved Mob Rules from back in the early/mid 90s. I'm also a fan of stories about the prohibition era. I don't think society would cope with prohibition now, and much less in the 20s when this took place. That is why stories are so fascinating to me. But every game about the mob during prohibition is the same, more or less, and they run dry after long.I'll sum it up with a list of pros and cons:Pros:- Good story line. It isn't strong, and in fact, far from original. But it is still a good story line. It is a little unique, but nothing special. Start small, build a reputation, and become big. It even spans the full prohibition era, for the most part.- Pretty decent city management sim. Again, nothing special here, but it is fun for a bit. There are quite a few options.- Plenty of maps. Each one increases in options and difficulty - but again, nothing too spectacular.- A lot of weapons and skills. Henchmen have plenty of skills to choose from, and each one can bring unique things to the table. You also have plenty of henchment to chose from based on play styles, so if you want a team of masterminds, or maybe thugs - there is room for this.Cons:- Every level, you start fresh. You bring a little bit from previous missions, and you get more increasing difficulties.- Every map starts becoming the same thing - over and over again. Start small, build up without becoming too noticed by the cops. Bribe them, and keep a low profile. They become terribly easy and uncreative after long, especially when you start learning what to do.- The learning curve isn't great enough to keep a steady interest. It is easy to learn, and easy to master. Again, once you find a good solid stratagy, every map is the same. There may be one curve ball here and there - but nothing to special.- The game only becomes more ""difficult"" because people rat you out (to be expected) and because the prohibition is coming to an end, cutting into your profits (again, to be expected). No real sense of accomplishment, more a sense of ""Well, I survived and made a profit early on...""- The story can be exceptionally predictable. No real surprises, and very few curveballs to keep you on your toes. Easy to go on autopilot.- After finding a winning stratagy, the game turns into ""Send henchmen somewhere, afk for a few minutes, come back and check on profits and missions completed.""- Rival AI is.... lacking. Seriously, there is no challenge from them. They litterally let you walk all over them and don't try to stop you. You can raid their places too easily, but nothing from them to retaliate. It's like they don't care at all they are losing to you.- Severe lack of a hard mode at all... At least, I didn't notice any difference on the difficulty settings.Again - It is a good game, don't get me wrong. but not really a $30-40 game.... Maybe a cool $8 game on holiday/summer sale, when you want to see what the prohibition is like.			"

												The idea behind this game is fascinating, the idea of a squad based tactic Mafia game makes all kinds of sense, and the idea of packaging into a kind of business management system makes all kinds of sense too. Layer a coherent gangster story on top of that, it really should have been a great game.It really isn't a great game.I think this game is a perfect case of spreading yourself too thin. If the combat was better, or if the management was better, this would be an easy sell, but everything just feels a bit lacking. I'm going to focus my complaints mainly at the combat because frankly, it's made by the same people as Tropico from 3 onwards, if you've ever played any of those games you already kind of know to expect theme over depth. It's what they do, I'm no big fan of it but it is what it is.The combat however was really just heartbreaking, because even if the combat wasn't great, they could have gotten it feel to thematically pleasing. And when I say this I mean like the classic scene of cops vs gansters in a fancy dining room, overturned tables, firing accross the room at each other. Instead what we get is dude hiding behind a table, other dude runs around the table with no supressing fire, pressing his double pistols into the first dudes back, missing both shots. Original dude runs around to side of the table, fires into the air and misses. Rinse and repeat for 5 rounds. It's not even that the RNG misses are BS(and it is, 70% to hit with a shotgun point blank, really?), it just feels completely unimmersive while playing it. The fact that there really isn't any surpesssing fire during enemy movement just breaks it completely, both mechanically and thematically.I really wish they'd look into a sequel with this game where they flesh out everything, because if it were done properly, it would be an instant classic. This game though, sadly, was a big swing and a miss.			"

												When I first saw the teaser trailer for Omerta: City of Gangsters, I was pretty excited. A game that takes place in 1920's Atlantic City where you play as a mob boss? That sounds awesome! Sadly, Omerta City of Gangsters is more bathtub gin than fine wine.One of this game's biggest problems is that it is pretty boring. There is a lot of downtime during the management sections, since there is no ability to speed up time. This is a pretty glaring omission considering this game uses almost the same kind of city managment style as the Tropico series, which does have the ability to speed up time. When you send a gangester out on a mission, like buying a property to set up a business, they have to walk all the way there and all the way back. This can be sped up by stealing cars, but it still takes far too long. The structure of a lot of the missions also means that you spend a lot of time simply sitting around waiting for your businesses to accumulate x number of dollars so you can move on to the next stage, with nothing interesting to do in the meantime. The game also has a ""heat"" system, which is the only real failure state. By committing crimes, you generate heat. When your heat reaches 5 stars, the police will launch an investigation. If you can't  weasel your way out of it via a bribe, you lose. You would think that a system like this is in place so players have a risk/reward with high heat actions gaining more money but also more heat, but everything you do in the game generates heat, so its basically just an arbitrary timer that ticks up as you play.All of this would be a little more forgivable if the other major section of the game was any better. That other section being turn based squad combat heavily inspired by XCOM. You bring a small squad of gangsters armed with various weapons, including the iconic Tommy gun, on a mission to take over businesses or rob banks. The weapon variety is extremely limited, with only eight different weapons to choose from, three of them being melee weapons.  The game features a cover system that works identically to XCOM, with cover reducing the enemy chance to hit, as well as the damage recieved. Unfortunately, because the combat had to be balanced with melee weapons in mind, the guns are extremely weak. Because of this, cover is not extremely vital. The AI will constantly just run up to you, never bothering to take cover, and proceed to shoot you from point blank or charge you down with melee weapons. The only two weapons this strategy doesn't really work against are the Tommy gun and the shotgun, since both fire in a cone that is more concentrated the closer they are to the target. Even this would be slightly more forgivable if it meant that you had to more carefully arm your gangsters to counter the enemy, but the way weapon acquistion is handled in the game is also problematic. Every character in the game has a default weapon and a distinct playstyle, but you can aquire new weapons from arms dealers in the world. However, the arms dealers only sell one weapon, and what weapon it is is completely random. If you are hunting for a Tommy gun and all the arms dealer has is a baseball bat, you are out of luck. The ability to either buy whatever weapon you want from arms dealers, or the ability to loot enemies would have made the game a lot more enjoyable,Unfortunately for Omerta, I must break the code of silence to say that this is not a very good game. It has a lot of potential, but executes on almost none of it. Hopefully the developers can take some of these lessons on to create a better sequel, but for the time being, Omerta has been fitted for a pair of concrete slippers and thrown into the Hudson River.

												Great fun for first couple of hours and I was surprised with the gameplay features but than chapter changes and you have to start over again (yes, you lose everything you did in last couple of hours) and this cycle goes on and on. It should be one continue Sim but its not :( the game got lots of potential but in each chapter you have to start from zero (doesn't make sense)			"

												I really wanted to like Omerta. It seemed like one of those instant bestsellers popping out of nowhere. After having played it for quite a while though, I cannot recommend it. You play as an italian (surprise eh) immigrant looking to make a fortune in the U.S.. Most of your actions are performed on a top-down map in real time. You can rent premises, establish some businesses like illegal breweries, boxing rings and pizzerias (yup) and they will generate money and ressources, which can be sold for even more money. You have a selection of gang-members at your disposal who will carry out your orders, like gathering information or eliminating a rival casino. This has all been done before, I remember playing Gangsters 2 by EIDOS and having a lot more fun. My main problem is that missions are way too short and as soon as you finish one, you start another one with all your achievements gone, from scratch. There is no continuity apart from who your gang-members are. You cannot have custom members either, as all of them come with preset backgrounds, portaits and loadouts. Additionally, they threw in a XCOM'esque turn-based-combat system for some special missions. While being an interesting addition, it just does not work that well and, again, other games have done it better. The multiplayer is a joke. You would expect to be able to play a big campaign in a vibrant city with multiple people, but all there is is 1on1 turn-based-combat matches, or Coop against the AI. No big Mafia-empire simulator to have hours of fun in, no intriguing scheme-play between you and your friends... just some rushed, copied gameplay definitely not worth full price.			"

												Ratings: 8.3/10 Worth playing Turn-Based Strategy Simulation game. Omerta - City of Gangsters's gameplay is somewhat unique and takes time to sum up and complete variety of missions and side-missions. The combat system is accurate enough, fighting against one another showing whose turn will be next and what you'll do and when it's your next move. I'm enjoying the game right now since I like simulation games like these. I got it on sale, not for full price, but I still appreciate it. Looking forward for upcoming updates.			"

They even added a thing in the beginning, where you can pick different things that you did in your youth, which will affect the present you! Its great!They really nailed it on this one, its been so fun playing it and i am looking forwad to play it!Pros:+Good soundtracks+Fun experience+Interesting story+Build your own past and future+Build your own empire+Meet interesting people+Multiplayer+Cooperative+""Applesauce!""Cons:-Not the best graphics-Can get very boring, especially when the fights usually repeat themselves - Otherwise the game seems alright to me.

												I was looking for a remake of Gangsters - Organized crime, and found this one. It's not the same, but it resembles, and although I do feel the mission-style approach is so-and-so since I would have preferred a more sandbox gangster organizing game, it's all right. It takes place during the 20's or somewhere around there, and it centers around gun smuggling, housing speakeasies, gambling dens and so forth. There's also a tactical part, where you do certain stuff to propel your area of influences and such, and a dividing in clean and dirty money keep track of what you gain from different businesses. Bribing an occasional cop, taking out rivaling gangs and hire employees is also part of it all.All in all, I recommend this game, especially for anyone interested in the era.			"

												Taking the role of a fresh-from-the-boat immigrant, with dreams of the big life, you must work your way up the criminal hierarchy of 1920s Atlantic City. Starting with small jobs, you'll recruit a gang and expand your empire by taking territory from other gangsters, to the point where you eventually establish your own crime syndicate and become the de facto ruler of this world.Practically everything you do is in search of more of the game’s resources--dirty and clean money, firearms, liquor, and beer. There exists a strange economy where you can exchange any of these items for another through various offers that get posted over time. Generally, each level in the campaign will ask you to harvest a certain amount of a particular resource or two. The system is interesting at first, but it quickly proves itself to be easily gamed. Your task is usually simply turning one thing which you have a lot of into something you don’t have much of. It’s just a matter of finding someone with the right offer for you--50 units of beer for $500 in dirty money, or 20 firearms for 20 bottles of liquor, for example.The need to distinguish between dirty money and clean income hints at depths that never appear. Then that mission ends, you're dumped on a new map, all benefits of your previous success magically erased as you start over from scratch again.As you progress through the game, the roster of mobsters will increase, each coming with their own specific weapon, and preference for violence. While this does vary the action, the whole thing becomes dangerously unbalanced; melee becoming a very distant second to anybody with a gun.Omerta: City of Gangsters feels under-developed and too clunky, which quickly sucks the joy out of playing. For me this game is an offer I CAN refuse, I can't recommend Omerta: City of Gangsters to even the biggest mafia fan. But if you feel this game might be something you'd enjoy, at least play the demo before spending any hard-earned cash.THE GOOD- A good idea for a game- A variety of mission types- Colourful cast of charactersTHE BAD- Slow-paced, restrictive, and dull- The game feels dated- Cover system is broken- Underdeveloped UI- Insufficient feedback mechanics- Fails to deliver on its potential in any areaDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												Pros: If you are a fan of the XCOM kind of isometric turn based combat, you will probably like this.  But a few caveats; this game is more about building up your criminal businesses than actual combat.  Expect to spend the majority of time panning around a little neighborhood in Atlantic city looking for a Premises or a Joint to add to your crime ring.  But that is not to say combat is lacking, there is a fair amount of it.Cons: Remember the XCOM comparison?  Unlike XCOM, this just does not have the same level of depth or mood, especially in its combat.  The sounds of the guns are muddled, the characters speak in some of the most cheesy dialogue, and the setting is right out of a 1940's B-Movie, including some latent racism/bigotry (i.e. the Irish character who when he isn't hiccuping between turns, is complaining about needing a drink).  Finally, as a technical concern the zoom is set too close in on the city screen, preventing a true bird's eye view of the various businesses in the neighborhood.  As a result, it can be maddening trying to find a particular location.Bonus Pet Peeve: Kalypso's redundant, pointless 3rd party DRM.  Despite playing through Steam, expect to have to set up a Kalypso account and then to mash the enter key a few extra times each time your try to start the game.Overall: If you like mobster games and the previously mentioned isometic style, by all means give it a try.  At its best, it is a fun little game.  But expect your enjoyment to be blunted a bit by the lack of polish and depth overall.  Don't buy it at full price, but wait for a sale.  This game gets steep discounts, in fact it was once free on a certain steam competitor that shall not be named.			"

And he took the loaves and fishes, looked at his disciples and said, ""F**k it. We're goin' into the whiskey business.""― Bill McCoy to Nucky Thompson, ""Boardwalk Empire"" SE01E01.As a kind of US-Prohibition bachelor I have long wanted to play this game. Re-watching HBO 'Boardwalk Empire' only increased the desire.After 38h (33h basic campaign + 4h Japanese DLC [not finished] + ~1h Rival Gangs sandbox):PROS+ Atlantic City during the prohibition era+ nice strategic system mastering districts/maps+ interesting buildings, except for the missing one+ dirty & clean money idea+ little RPG: character class, talents, perksCONS- totally terrible combat system:* fights are totally chaotic* fights are too difficult even on easy becuse enemies are always a lot more, have a much better weapons, and above all - their accuracy is way better than ours; two examples:1. There is a mission in which my four characters face six opponents. Guess how many shots I missed? 47. Forty-seven. And not with a chance of 30-45%, but 60+...How many shots AI missed? 13. Lucky thirteen :/2. There is a mission where you have to kill (again) thirteen Ku-Klux-Klan members. Except my four-henchman team there are also two-three friendly gangsters steered by an AI. Guess how many KKK folks I killed? 4. Four.AI? 9. Nine. Why? Because AI shooting to AI makes it better than I 'cause... AI has no unfairly undervalued accuracy...- special damage's system, with particular emphasis on Bleeding :/- KKK 'mobsters' with Tommy-guns and... flamethrowers? Really? I understand and admire burning crosss style, but this is a little exaggeration- mobsters with katanas in an Italian/Irish gang? Why Japanese DLC is mixed with basic campaign like this?- the only missing building: where's w***ehouse? o0 you can kill, you can steal, you can bootlegging, BUT you can not f***? ...- economic system's too easy even on hard- a small types of weapon- DLC 'The Japanese Incentive':* three words: Rival Gangs idea. And the same applies to Sandbox mode.* probably the story itself is interesting, probably it has interesting ending (especially when we have a woman traveling from Asia in Tyrion Lannister style [it means in a box XD], but this can't be determined by the idea of... economic-combat?* want more? --> http://omerta-city-of-gangsters.wikia.com/wiki/Rival_Gang BUT:1. Why did the police react only on my breaking the law?2. Why rival gang takes over my building (for example - brewery), I regain it and... in the middle there is no brewery, just an empty lot waiting for development?3. 'Hired Goons' option is totally too expensive (1000$ even in the most miserable place) and totally ineffective, because of one-time use.4. Other gangs are developing too fast even on easy and prevention is even more chaotic than combat system.5. Why attack the main gang's hideout depends on their other properties? Why I can't kill them in main base, without gaining twenty-more other buildings? o0 Subjective rate: D-/F in fact unplayable most of the time, 'cause of combat system (and we're fighting a lot) and Rival Gang system. I finished basic campaign only for the story and Atlantic City (A+/B-, but I'm in love with USProhi-times & mafia), but only thanks to the trainer. But even trainer wasn't enough for what is done in the Japanese DLC. Sandbox... it's not worth talking.I'm very sad for how this game was spoiled. Really. Great potential have been lost by one of the most tragic combat systems I've seen.			"

												I have a thing for Gangster themed games, whilst the Godfather 2 was pretty much panned im the few who enjoyed it quite a lot and it seems I’ve done it again with Omerta, well almost.Omerta is at heart a turn based shooter (Similar to that of XCOM however not anywhere near as good) and most of the time you spend in a real time strategy scenario in different parts of the city, and your main goal is to make dirty and clean cash whilst completing objectives on the RTS mode and certain objectives in the TBS mode.Easily the weakest points about Omerta is the combat, its fairly terrible and whilst its fun when you have a badass team, unfairly balanced missions means you rarely have fun in the combat mode at least for me though im not a massive turn based shooter fan so im fairly bias on that. The redeeming features is the rather fun management mode in the RTS sections that gladly you spend at least 80% of your time doing. Buying buildings and construction sites to build many different buildings. These earn you fear and Respect,  and happiness and people like you more, both needed for certain aspects of the game.  However most importantly you earn money, sweet sweet money.The graphics of the game are fairly well done, they look well detailed and the game ran perfectly on my system at 120fps constant. I didn’t test if the game was 3D or not however the time needed to play the game id rather not play it long hours with 3D enabled regardless. The story is sadly just lacking, I felt uninterested in the story other than what the objectives were and paid no attention to the overall story of the game and whilst I enjoyed the music a lot in the game I couldn’t help feel it didn’t match the game.Pros:-	Nice Gangster themed game that hits all the notes.-	Good art design and graphics-	Nice RTS intergration.Cons:-	Just purely unenjoyable combat-	Feels dragged out-	Gets very repetitive early on into the gameI would give this game a 5/10, it has many issues, I missed a bunch of them as well as the launch of the game was said to be horrific so im glad I missed out on them however the game feels barebones yet enjoyable for the single play though I did, I just couldn’t wait to finish it.- Dean- I'd only really get it, if you like me like Ganster themed games, no matter the big flaws.

												I played omerta this week and it made me an offer I couldn't refuse. This game caught my eye because it combined some of my favorite things gangsters and stragtey games. This game takes us back to a prohibition Atlantic City or commonly known as the playground of the world. And in this city you can build you're criminal empire anyway you choose whether you go mostly clean and build pharmacies to sell ""medical liquor"" to the masses or set up a safehouse to set up for a heist. After setting up your money makers you're going to need to fight off you enemies, whitch could vary between the KKK or a rival gang looking to take your business and your spot as a big time mob family. And if you're going to declare war on these other factions you're going to need henchmen to dirty work and take a bullet for you every now and then. Each goon has their own backrounds and bios but ultimately you end up caring about one and the rest are cannon fodder; my favorite ended up being sqiugs. But each character has his or her own weapon any where from brass knuckles to tommy guns to shotguns. And speaking of weapons the combat is a lot like X-COM with cover and percentage based shots but, unlike X-COM not all cover and buildings are breakable which makes sense, bullets can only do so much damage and in X-COM you can not build and destoy mob empires. And the guns all serve their purpose with shotguns and tommy guns being for wide spread damage, and rifles and pistols being more accurate. And the mulltiplayer seem to have good intentions but, it dosen't have the empire constructing; just the combat. In the end, the multiplayer feels tacked on. Well, we come to the big question is this game worth the money and I find myself saying its worth you're money, but not worth Forty Dollars. I aqiured this game on sale and I reconmend the same or at least untill a price drop. But don't get me wrong this game is deserving of your money, but in my opinion not Forty Dollars.			"

												The original game wasn't really worthwhile, mainly because it was quite buggy. But the developers actually patched a lot, added a bunch of new features and with the ""Japanese Incentive"" DLC it actually became quite a good game, which I enjoyed very much!To be fair, XCOM and XCOM 2 have the same Gameplay behind it just... executed better, but if you've already played through those, I can really recommend this game! Especially the Gold Edition during a sale.			"

												This is the kinda game that needs a 'so so' button - not a thumbs up or thumbs down.Its an ok game - kinda like Gangsters 'monopoly'. Basically you buy/capture buildings, set up shops and generate income to buy weapons/sell booze etc and upgrade your gangsters skills/weapons/levels to win the game... and then rince repeat for each level. Obviously the more property/income you have, the easier it becomes.The fighting part of the campaigns are turn based and require some thinking and planning. This can be challenging and fun - probably the best bit IMHO. Multiplayer with some friends is pretty fun in this as well. The rest of the game is mediocre. You dont really feel like you are the gang boss... its more like you're just managing it. So not real immersive and doesnt get you hooked enough to feel for the characters or that you are one of the characters.So yes, buy it on sale for a time waster and some mild entertainment. But if your after something like the old games  Gangsters and Gangsters 2 - then this is not the game for you.			"

												The ""tycoon"" style of building your empire can be fun, doing jobs, renting and building establishments, but there's nothing else to it. Just buying, selling and building, with the odd job here and there. Granted that each map gets bigger and has more oppourtunities, it really dosen't give much else to do. You'll spend time just watching over, micro managing, or even not managing at all.The combat system feels like an XCOM style system. Granted that again there isn't much to it, just taking cover, shooting over cover, killing badguys and stealing loot, you'd get more fun out of an XCOM game. Granted you can play using perma-death rules, the only real penalties for losing mob members is a slow down in activities during the tycoon stage, and the invevitable game over.Overall if the two sections were fleshed out more and felt better to play with, it'd be more fun. A good game that lacks substance but, if it had said substance it'd be an awesome game. Still if you planning on grabbing it, watch it go on sale.			"

You have to expand your empire over the city, buying breweries and speakeasies, along with many others, during prohibition. There are different weapons with their own stats and specialties, and characters choose perks to help specialize themselves along with their core stats. So far, the story is okay, and the gameplay is fun.9/10			"

A turned based point click tactics, such as used in other odler games. Has a good story line, and gives the player decent options to expand his control. Yet lacks that freedom of movement and combat outside of instanced quest zones. It still has life in Sandbox mode even after you defeat the main quest and its multple DLC zones.			"

												I do recommend this game. It's a lot of fun. It really puts you in the concept of gangsters.Besides, you have to plan things out, so you can run your business without being suspicious. It's all in the strategy.I played for plenty of minutes REALLY cool for the concept.Still, there are quite some downers. The main reason it's the price of it. I got it on sale (75%), but if wasn't for it, I wouldn't buy it. It's too much for what the game offers you. Another thing is that the maps while you are in the combat phase seem all too much the same. I asked myself plenty of times: ""Haven't I done this mission already?!"" - Just because the maps are all too much alike. Also, if you're the type of person who don't like to wait, this is not the game for you. You got to be patiente about the resources and when to strike (Because of heat).So... I give this game 4 out of 5, if you're not looking to prices. Recommend it :)			"

												Omerta City Of Gangsters, is a truely great game in my opinion which has a interesting background it is set back in the mid 1900's back in good old America where you come to make your dreams come true and deal with some family issues the game itself imploys some real time stratergy along with your own customization options for who u wish to have on your team when u go and do fights. You get to choose which buildings u own and can make your men do side jobs to earn the money u need like robbing cars and doing shoot-outs.Pros - Some RTS (Real time stratergy involved)- Choosing who u get to fight with- Good graphics - Eagle eye view command (u can tell your guys what to do/go even when not doing missions/ you have eagle eye view which means very high above for those who dont know what it means)- Fluent controls although you are mainly using a mouse/ mousepad - has controller support which is a great plus for people who like using their ps3/ xbox controllers- You can change the weapons of which your gang use and make your own playstyle- Multiplayer (Co-Op) for me was fun me and my friends did some missions together like robbing banks and shootouts.Cons- A few bugs, not many but there are a few- Not really a storyline, but each charachter starts out with a different beginning which is good- Once your done with the area the next place is really only a bigger verison of the last city, would of been nice if new places implemented new things, although in the beginning of the game each time u go to a new place there will be a few new things- Once you'r done with the game you probably won't come back.So the game overall is a very fun game and worth buying for quite a fun hours of fun and does it have replay potential well in many ways yes but hey ill let you decide for yourselves7/10 Fun game and a great experience i truely do recommended those who like RTS and Co-op and of course Gangster games to try this out!!!

												Omerta is a well made mix of The Godfather movies (a gangster story), SimCity (a city manager simulator) and X-COM (a turn-based game). In each part of the story you get to control one district to earn money and supplies by openning businesses and doing criminal activities. The game often forces you to leave this city manager mode and participate in turn-based combat with a variety of characters with their own traits and weapons to choose from. There isn't much more to it but if you are into these two genres, stories and movies about America of those earlier years, you should enjoy the game as much as I do.			"

Though there are DLC packs, but I wouldnt buy them.So i'll say it one more time, take your money elsewhere and buy something else.			"

												Like many other I got this game as a pre-order special for Tropic 5. Since I love mafia games (Like Mafia, Mafia 2) and love Tropico I thought this would be a lot of fun. And indeed it was..... in the first 40mins. After about an hour, it got boring but I forced myself to play it even longer. After all, there was a small chance it would get better, but sadly, it didnt.Dont get me wrong, it isnt a bad game, it just isnt a good game. The graphics, the voice acting and the basics of the game are amazing and that makes it even harder when you find out that the game literally through away all the possibility it had and ended up like that. You have basic base building with decoration. Your people can steal cars, you can buy different buildings and do missions for all kinds of people, but it is not enough. It has the same problem Tropico has. There is a bit of everything, but not enough. There are to few missions, to few things todo and, oh god, this really bad combat system. I spent a lot of time in XCOM: EU and I love turned base games since then, but this game messed it up really bad. I dont rage often, but this made me rage. Just bad.So, please make a another Omerta game but listen to all the reviews and fix what you have done wrong here. The idea is good, the concept in many areas too.So, should you buy Omerta? No, no you shouldnt.			"

												I bought this game through humble bundle while it was on sale, and got the game and all of its DLC for about 8$, after playing it now for about 10 hours I feel fairly confident in saying I'd pay full price for this, It's creation for the single player main character is somewhat similar to mount and blades in the sense that you create your background, which in turn influences your starting stats, though dont expect it to be as in depth as mount and blades. The game splits its gameplay somewhere between a real time tycoon game for the map based gameplay and turn based combat comparable to a simplified version of the old fallout games. The progression uses a system based around unlocking a new perk when you level and theres a moderately large list of perks to choose from but they're very black and white about what they change. You can easily jump into combat on a regular basis if thats what you want to do, but you can also avoid it like the plague and stick to the tycoon type gameplay if thats your preference. Dont let the mixed reviews of the game scare you off, Honestly the 62% it has while I'm writing this isnt justified. If you do decide to get this game my reccomendation would be to take your time and enjoy it, dont just power through the story as fast as you can or else it WILL be a waste of money. Definitely worth trying but I'd say try and get it on a sale			"

												A fun Management game with tactical combat similar to Jagged Alliance and Fallout.You run a mafia crew earning dirty money that needs to be laundered into clean money. Most buildings, upgrades and important deals can be solved with dirty money and is your life line in the game. In addition to the two form of money you also have beer, booze and firearms. These 3 resources are also used in exploring, upgrading and making money.There are 3 level of buildings as well, the Joints, Premises and Construct lots. Some have synergy effect on one another, like Bookmakers improve Boxing Rings and Casinos, Loan Sharks improves Bookmakers and so on. You also have 2 morality scores, Liked and Feared. These affect various buildings you might own. The Management is somewhat simple and easy to master, the combat however is hard and can easily require a restart of the map simply because of a slight mistake or missing a single shot. But I really enjoy the combat, it is my type of difficult. Tactical and fun.Your Mafia Crew have several classes which gives them a core set of abilities, their attribute determins what they are good at. High Mucle gives great movement points and melee damage, Cunning improves Action Points and crit, Finesse Firearms, smarts your initative or sequence of acting and so on. It is important to use cover, and some covers can be destroyed. Grenades have a delay to activate and it is a good thing when the enemy throw a grenade into the room you have placed your troops in, giving you time to get away.Overall a fun game and well worth the money.

												It is what it is...take it or leave it. I enjoyed it, and feel like I got my money's worth out of it. (I got this on sale and let's face it...most of us get our games this way). The main syle of gameplay (city view"")is pretty straightforward, buy stuff, wait for the task to complete wash, rinse, repeat.Some parts of the game are turn based where your crew fights another crew.Don't like the turn based aspect, you can ""auto resolve"". (% chance..just save before and reload if you fail)You can level up your crew and specialize in certain things (The RPG aspect is only a tiny portion of the game, however).The voice acting isn't horrible and fits in with the setting, though the phrases are repeated enough to drive one insane. Speaking of the setting, it is unique and the story is interesting enough.Fun game that I got for $5...sorry, but I cannot recommend spending $20 on this, much less $30 for the Gold edition (Though the DLC isn't bad).

												A somewhat-simplistic semi-turn-based strategy game (At least compared to, say, Civ), you command a bunch of gangsters working to take control of 1920s Atlantic City. Think ""Boardwalk Empire"" meets ""Tropico"" (The latter of which should feel familiar given it's the same developers).You do business by dealing in three commodities: beer, liquor and firearms. Beer is cheap and easy, liquor is a bit harder and can get you ""clean"" money (Itself used to purchase legitimate businesses), firearms are generally later in the round and are rather lucrative. This is done via a top-down interface that is somewhat real-time. Actions in this mode can result in tactical turn-based battles, pitting your mobsters against police, FBI and other gangs.I played it on a trip and the hours flew by. The atmosphere is great and the single-player campaign is spot-on. I don't have any experience with the multiplayer, though I expect I'd get my derriere handed to me if I tried (If I ever try the multiplayer, I'll make sure to update this review with my experiences).Quite recommended, especially if on sale.

So when you're done with the mission, you have to start all over in another part of town.The turn-based battle idea was pretty cool. I cannot complain about it because I find it put to great use in this game.I could write a lot about the game, but I suggest you actually try it out. I like the game because of the era it reflects.

												RTS mixed with third person TBS. Great game if you like casual building of an empire mixed with sporadic killing missions where you get to shoot/punch/bat/stab rival gang members in the face from the safety of your turn on the board. The 'hit' missions are based around bulidings so there are places to hide and shoot from, or you can go all out for a face to face shootout. The only drawback I have found so far is the AI in the 'hit' missions; they always go straight for you - they never hang back and wait for you to come to them or choose the best mathematical strategy and can be easy to beat if you are aware of that fact. Good game.			"

												Not a bad game if you can get it for a good price (<$10).You have a bunch of objectives each mission and whatever else you do doesn't seem to matter as long as you complete those objectives.Money earned dirty and clean does not appear to carry over between missions, so there really isn't incentive to build up a vast ""criminal empire"" each mission, but rather drive towards the objective.The combat phases when you have them allow you to select up to 4 gangsters to control.  They can have firearms or melee weapons and take turns with the ai opponents moving and attacking.			"

I highly recommend watching TotalBiscuit's WTF on this game on youtube, to understand what this game is, and isn't. Then you can make the informed decision if this is a game you will enjoy. Many of the poor reviews merely reflect that this wasn't the game some people may have wanted. But I am greatly enjoying it, as my expectations were set correctly by TotalBiscuit.			"

												I recently picked up the Gold Edition in the Humble Store for a few bucks. And I must say, after reading all the negative reviews of this game, and being turned off of the game for a long time because of them. (Which itself is not normal for me, I usually pay no attention to other ""reviews"") I was very surprised at how good this game is.Not going to go into crazy detail, want to keep this short.It's a nice combination of RTS-ish overworld gamplay and turn-based combat similar to X-Com. I've only done the Singleplayer so far, so I have no input on how the Sandbox or MP modes are. But in SP, you create your boss, then you go into a map-view and pick your missions. Sometimes you're just trying to earn money, others want you to take over an entire district. Overall I find it very enjoyable.			"

The game is an interesting mix of management/trading sim and action sequences. I actually like the ""raids"" and whatnot, as the fighting is easy to understand and plot out. I spent a lot of extra time in some of the earlier rounds just getting a feel for things, and I think it helped me a lot for the later rounds. I still highly recommend this game, especially since you can generally find the ""GOLD"" version on sale for between $4-$7.			"

												This game feels like a high quality board game run in real time. To some that might not sound appealing but I have had everything I wanted out of this title and more. It's sleek, it's deep, it's fast and it's all wrapped up in a thick cloud of car fumes, cigar smoke, ladies perfume and the smell of bodies in back alleys.My one gripe is the combat, the turn based x-com fighting asides are a little clunky but the're not the focus of this title, more like a mini-game that you some times have to stoop to between running your entirely legal enterprises.If you like strategy games with a little something on the side, I highly recomend this.

												If you like games with city management, profit and loss, and a bit of turn based combat than this has got everything for you. The story may not be the greatest, nor the graphics or gameplay but the full package together blends a good combination of RTS and simulation.On one hand youre trying to play Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta by micro managing profit and loss by raiding, stealing, and brewing; ""Take a 200 dollar case'a booze and move it out the back and sell it for'a hundred. Who cares? Its all profit."" While on the other hand your trying to muscle your competition like Joe Pesci with your fists, knives, or a gun; ""You beat Nicky with your fists and he comes back wit'a knife. Beat him with a knife? He comes back wit'a gun. Beat him wit'a gun and you better kill 'em because he'll keep comin' back and back until one'a you'z is dead.""Overall: 8 / 10Very enjoyable.			"

												An average game.It's not hard to master and features a well thought progression system. It feels as if the developers focused more on the combat system and didn't really put much effort in the city management system. The combat system itself is good, my only concern is when you miss shots when an enemy is right in front of you and sometimes the AI is too unbalanced. At times, I felt the game was slow as you wait for resources and money to stack up or when you send one of your henchmen on a mission. The ability to manipulate time would have been a good addition.If you want to kill time, get it cheap and play. You'll enjoy it for a few hours unless you can cope with repetitiveness. If you have friends that own the game try multiplayer!In summary, a game with a lot of potential but unfortunetely it didn't deliver. Hopefully there will be a (better) sequel.			"

												Omerta is a simple game, in terms of limited system resources. The game itself has some excellent simulation for running your own crime family. The s combat section can be a little frustrating, as turning the map to get a good angle is not only necessary, but could be easier. The voice acting is generic, and there are portions that could be considered offensive to racial, ethnic, and religious groups; of course this is the roaring 20s.If you're looking for a ""gangster"" game set in prohibition, you could do a lot worse. If there was one wart that I don't like, it's the lack of accuracy with Tommy Guns. Seriously! They can't hit the broad side of a barn from the inside!!!			"

												First off, the game is not like the pictures suggest. You don't walk around town controlling your character and get into gangfights. The gangfights happen as part of what is esentially a Sim City environment. They are set up in a pretty straightforward manner. On normal difficulty and easy its pretty much slug it out until you eventually win. On hard the curve is ""Too easy as you learn the basics"" to ""Too hard as you now are given a challenge"" to ""Too easy again, as you've now unlocked high level powers."" Sandbox mode seemed fun, till I realised the AI uses the same generic units for that too, meaning they always outnumber you still. You can't bring more than 4 men into a fight, but the enemy can bring in 11, all of which have similar (a few have had even better) stats than you.Edit: After playing a little more, there is perhaps more depth than I originally felt. While sometimes the difficulty is untweaked, my first run ins with the game seem to have just been a little more difficult than the average fight (I'm now more commonly hitting groups of 5 than 11.) I'm changing my recommendation to a thumbs up, but there are more satisfying experiences out there.			"

												I got this free with the pre-order of Tropico 5 so I can't complain about the price, however after the first 3 or 4 missions you find your self doing the same thing over and over again, building a business, renting stuff, building stuff, collecting money etc...  I was hoping, like many have said, a style similar to Syndicate of yesteryear but sadly it's not, it got pretty boring very quickly.The worst eapon I've found is the grenades, you throw one and you have to wait the whole turn before they blow, by that point, the AI has moved out of the blast range and you have wasted it. It needs to have more user input, weapons research, more upgrades to buildings, better combat, blowing out light bulbs to make it harder to see and attack.Something I found annoying was Melee attacks that can hurt you through the wall and being shot when hiding behind pillars, boxes and other objects - maybe they should of made it RTS combat rather than TB.

Stop wanting, and open your wallet, and buy Omerta - City of Gangsters. Deffinitely worth every penny. Either do a story-based campaign, or launch yourself into a sandbox game, where only your imagination limits you (than, and the map size).Originally, I was apprehensive about buying Omerta - City of Gangsters, but I nabbed it in the Winter Sale, and got hooked instantly. If you like micromanagement, control and role-playing games, Omerta is for you. If you also like the time period, or decent games in general, purchase Omerta - City of Gangsters now!Almost deffinitely worth the money, why are you still reading this?! Buy it now!			"

I read all the negative comments about the game, unfortunately not until after I bought the thing.  Its like the game can't decide what it wanted to be, so in the end it became nothing.  The combat is a joke even early in the game.  Even on easy mode, the AI is completely unbalanced, and you wind up dyring again and again, with no chance of advancing.  Never more then 4 gangters up against 13 or more heavily armed enemies, who make three moves to your one.  The ""story"" is basically recycled from every mobster cliche there is, with nothing original about it.  Don't waste your money on this game, its not worth it.			"

												Like some reviews have said, Omerta is sadly like a glorified facebook-game in certain regards. The actual turn-based combat is fun, the enemy AI is strong. But the city management element is shallow, slow and repetitive. You'd think I hate the game. In some ways it's easy to be disappointed when you know this game comes from the developers of the Tropico-franchise. Ironically, I find the game to be strangely addictive. The world looks great, the characters are wacky, the soundtrack fits perfectly and the game overall does a good job at getting you into the game through a good tutorial, and keeping you hooked for hours on end.Omerta is an addictive game, for sure. And if you actually get into it, it's quite a bit of fun too. It's only too bad that the unique and promising elements of the game are ruined by how shallow everything is. There's not much thought or planning required when playing, and you never really feel like your choices matter all that much in the long run.With a lengthy singleplayer-campaign with a decent variation in the missions themselves aswell as added cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes, Omerta is fun if you're into the theme and genre. But It is however NOT worth the outrageous €45 pricetag. Not by a long shot.			"

												The co-op has so much potential... it is a real shame that it was obviously tacked on as an afterthought instead of making it the main focus of this game. If they scrapped the singleplayer and just used those resources to add way more depth to the upgrade system in multiplayer, and if they had bothered adding far more enemy types as well as more random spawns (to keep replay value), and if they added at least 15 maps instead of a grand total of 2 stinking maps (it claims to have added more in the most recent patch so I'll have to check that out), this game could have been lots of fun. The combat itself is pretty addicting.. If you are hoping for a co-op XCOM with gangsters like I was, you'll definitely be disappointed.			"

												Bland/repetitive gameplay with no real difficulty. The actual turn based combat sections are also broken to the point of being boring. Every mission plays out the exact same way yet you still have to start from scratch each time. That might be fine if the combat itself was able to hold up its end.Gangsters: Organised Crime is a better game in every respect but graphics (it is, after all, from 1998). If you want something similar but not involving crime try X-COM, Xenonauts, Silent Storm, Jagged Alliance 2 or even the new XCOM.There is also the 100% free game UFO:Alien Invasion.			"

.Now to the game. This game has fancy design, music and stuff is amazing. Gameplay splits between city control - you can send you thugs to buy building and build your criminal empire or assault another band. And shootouts - you send some gang members to fight some bandits. Both are good, but i've noticed some bugs in battles, like being able to punch someone through a wall.8/10 'Cuz bugs and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ launcher.			"

												I love tactical RPG's, I also love the romantic notion of the Mafia, this game...does not suger coat the fact that you are a criminal, you will be facing the law, and you will be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all in the name of profit, family, and honor. The story was simple and enjoyable, the gameplay a very decent blend of city managment and tactical RPG combat, and the different missions do keep ya from always using the same tactics. Early on while you have a small group and not quite the best weapons (seriously do yourself a favor and get new weapons when ya can, see the deputy and local crime lord for em) the game can be a challenge and you may be resetting multiple times, but still to it, it was a great time sink for me.My only real complaint is a lack of windowed mode, and using the arrow keys for movement, but its small potatoes compaired to the decently made game.

												I had really high hopes for this game, but the strategic part (building and improving your revenues) pretty much means a lot of meaningless cliclking. There is no much choice, or place of optimisation. You dont't have to build supply chains, tune and defend them from competition. Just wait for good offers on the black market and click on them. When you get enough resources, you improve your businesses, and they give you more money. So you can improve them further. Very repetitive, gets boring waay to quick. Tactial fighting is just ok.

												I played the original title -browser one- in the past, about 10 years ago. I like mafia things and i did give it a shot. It's a nice game but contents are too limited for a strategy title. If developers plan a sequel, they must strongly study about contents at least. And real-time multiplayer like the original title would be really great, because real-time is/was the actual point for Omerta. My thoughts about Omerta, pros / cons:+Nice graphics+Nice music+Hiring members for family+Turn base team combat+You can develop your family members what you want like your main character+Story is okay-Tropico like camera controls would be nice-Contents are too limited for a mafia world-Maps are small even in sandbox mode-There are almost no neighbourhood families or they're not challenging-Repetitive gameplayNow think about it, there are servers with low capacity (about 100-250 people) and there are families, you must be part of a family or you can be capo (like original Omerta) and families clash eachother for occupy some districts. You're level up like an mmo. Would it be nice?			"

												The game is fun don't get me wrong and has TONS of potential as it's nice to have control of gangsters in a kind of Mafia version of Sims. You can't control your characters at all except assigning them tasks which make them unavailable for long periods of time, they just seem to aimlessly wander about (like the many other pedestrians that simply walk up and down the streets single file and have NO other actions. The combat is so horrible.....so sloppy, the computer will outmove/outgun/outnumber you every time as you scratch your head trying to make sense of the sloppy move/act system. I find it funny how this game is on for $21.99 and yet I found it in a Dollarama for $3 (and Duke Nukem Forever was included)			"

												A good game with a strong concept and a lot of potential. It has a good story, with great environment as a Prohibition Era simulator. The gameplay is entertaining, you manage your criminal empire, renting warehouses to expand storage facilities, drive-byes to vacate the competition and establish you own joints or premises from which you draw income in dirty or clean money. There is also an RPG element as you can hire and fire characters to your gang and develop their skills, this however seems to be scripted in the campaign. The turn based combat system is fun to play but can also be incredibly unfair even with high leveled characters. The cover system seems a bit broken and does break the excitement.The game itself holds a lot of potential, but could be improved in so many aspects that it didn’t even require a new game. Buildings like the deputy houses, the crime lord’s house, celebrity houses or city officials are nothing more than simple houses with very little detail. The construction lots are a good example of how great it could have been, because if you build a hotel it will look like a hotel, these are minor problems but could be improved if only a little more effort was put in the map design.Sandbox mode was always a welcome addition in any game for me, until I played Omerta. It does offer more opportunities than the campaign, providing more of a challenge than the campaign but still manages to disappoint. It lacks proper rivals to compete or even a negotiation option because the A.I will simply attack your businesses at random with no chance to defend them without a security agency and then you need 5 firearms to retake each business and develop them all over again.  Just like the campaign, you start each district from scratch with tons of renting possibilities which is always nice and does allow for a much larger organization than the campaign but it’s still unbalanced, you will get attacked randomly without notice and the goons you pay 1000$ each business to protect it, just vanish with 3 shots from a drive-by.I did love the environment of the campaign with the excellent prohibition environment, a nice soundtrack, good voice acting, and the gameplay is addictive and even if every district need to be started from scratch I didn’t really mind to much. It is a bit rough around the edges and could use a bit more work like more maps, a more balanced combat and management system with deeper and unscripted character customization. I do recommend Omerta, it is a good game but it has a lot more potential, consider purchasing it at 75% sale.			"

												I had a friend constantly telling me to buy this game for over a year. Almost everytime I said something about games such as XCOM, Dungeon Keeper, Evil Genius or similar games, he reminded me that I should totally buy this game because I will like it.A few days ago he went right ahead and bought it for me, even after I told him countless times not to do it. And in the end, I did not like the game that much. As usual, I will speak about the bad things of the game first:First and foremost, this game tries REALLY HARD to be the Gangster XCOM, but in the end fails hard. During combat, you have multiple units (a max of 4 units with one guy as Support, and in some cases allied units controlled by the game), which aparently evolve as you play. However, I can't really see any evolution. During the almost 4 hours I've played, SOME of my characters leveled up ONCE, and I don't see any ""Experience left to LVLUP"" anywhere at all. The game didn't tell me at any moment how or when do I level up. Then, we have the weapons of the characters. It's kind of a joke, but pistols felt way more powerful THAN MOTHERF#CKING SHOTGUNS. AT POINT BLANK RANGE. Range on itself seems to be a joke and I don't see anyway of changing the weapons your characters have, while the biggest problem with the game is cover. The maps are filled with objects, but they don't really offer a big advantage, and blow up after getting hit once or twice anyway. In the end, it feels like a poor attempt of ripping off XCOM which backfired.Outside of combat, we have a Strategy game, really similar of the Tropico games (it's made by the same guys, and it seems to run on the same engine as Tropico 4, as I've seen some models being reused). However, there's not that much to it. There's two kinds of money, you can buy buildings that will get you more dirty or clean money, you can get more firearms... But in the end, I just wish I was playing Tropico 4, as it feels shallow and unfinished. The enemy never seems to do anything that interesting. At times you'll get the police investigating your♥♥♥♥♥ but you can just bribe them off, tell them someone else did it, kill the witness and stuff like that. Maps are also too small on my opinion, at least compared to the huge islands you could have in Tropico games.Something that also pisses me off, and that this company seems to enjoy doing, is DRM. WHAT IS THE BIG IDEA!? THE GAME IS ON STEAM, WHY DOES IT NEED THIS!? You're forced to make an account on their damn page, and log on everytime you want to play. For me, it just feels amateur-ish. Like they want to do it because the big companies, like EA or Ubisoft do it. Well, that sucks, good job.I also see that the game has some weird AI. For example, you can steal cars which serve as a ride for your characters, so they move faster. However, your characters will at times take the car and run arround a few blocks when THEY ONLY HAVE TO CROSS THE STREET, TO A HOUSE THAT'S RIGHT INFRONT OF THEIR BASE. It's redundant as hell, makes your characters, at times, TAKE LONGER TO GET SOMEWHERE ON A CAR, THAN ON FOOT. And the cars break down constantly, so I don't even bother most of the time. You can also buy a car, but seems stupid when the whole city is filled with cars that you can steal.Aim also seems to be a joke. Funny enough, it feels like they based that on XCOM. There, people have felt betrayed at the game because you can miss point blank shoots and crap, which is insanely unlucky, but it can happen. Here on this game, I constantly missed 75% shots, which felt lame as hell because my enemies almost never missed. Now top that with the damn cover mechanics that felt unfinished, and you have an atomic bomb of dissapointment and fustration.The game also lacks a way to speed things up. You'll be at times waiting for crap to happen, while your resources keep rising and your henchmen go somewhere. If there was the option in Tropico, WHY NOT HERE!?Lastly, character customization. There's nearly noone. At the start you can choose stats, but it's never explained what those stats do, when will they do anything, NOTHING AT ALL. While being able to select your stats with questions is cool, it would also be great if you could also choose a weapon or some sort of equipment at the start. So, does the game have good stuff? Yeah. The soundtrack is good. The voices are decent (most characters sound bored as hell, and some even throw unfunny jokes, but outside of that they're good), there seems to be a lot of maps (even though they're small, short and the game sells more in DLC's), you get the picture. However, it's a flawed game that feels unfinished, that might appeal to a small amount of people while being boring to much others.On my opinion, don't buy it. If you like the economic part of the game, buy Tropico 4. If you like the combat areas of it, buy XCOM; Enemy Unknown. And if you do wish to buy this game, wait for a sale, and probably wait to be dissapointed. It's pretty much a Monopoly game based on the 1920's, that's missing half the board.Well, at least I got dissapointed for free, this time.			"

Doesn't really feel like more difficult through challenge, simply through frustration. Combat feels tacked on, like the original concept was only the Simulation of being a mobster. Also, early on, no matter how sucessful you might be in the simulation, it doesn't matter, for the combat is always a number game, not really filled with true skill.Overall, this game really just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

												The images make it seem too much like a free roam or like XCOM, when it's neither. It's much more like Tropico or even a dumbed-down version of SimCity... minus the city building. The few combat missions you might run into once every hour or so are always either too simple or, much like advanced modes of XCOM, happen to insta-kill/critical hit one of your characters. Sadly, I believe it looks much better than it is. But if you like sitting around watching yourself earn money and beat whatever level by claiming the small city, just to start it all over again later... have at it.			"

												As some of the other reviews have mentioned, the game play is fairly repetitive. You go to a different part of Atlantic City, set up your business, raise capital, smuggle boose and guns, expand your operation with different legal and illegal activities, then eventually you have to take someone on in a gun fight. Raise more money to pay off a bigger boss, rinse and repeat. Thats all good and the game setting itself will probably have me come back for more because of its general feel.The reason I am not recommending this game is the random factor of gun fights. The fact that a guy with a shotgun misses from point blank range on a guy that just punched him is ridiculos, and will drive you mad. The fact that a punch does more damage than a gun shot wound, even tho I understand trying to keep the game balanced in a way, is ridiculos. I've played some gun fights twice in a row, you can use the exact same positioning and shots, and end up with one extra guy alive or double your HP, by doing nothing different. More luck than skill.			"

												Top down, gangster / mafia themed, business management game set in 1920's Atlantic City, with turn-based combat missions in some way similar to XCOM games.Story follows young immigrant from Europe (Player), who went to USA the land of opportunity. Not much in form of back story, you arrive to America and begin notorious career path as gangster. Every mission is split into part of city that has different points of interest you can purchase, rent, buyout or simply take by force from owners and make your own. Your primary income is dirty and clean money.Dirty money is useful to fuel shady businesses and can be laundered for use in legit businesses. Clean money is useful to buy property, invest in legal businesses or to buy new vehicles for your crew. Every crew member can complete tasks in city, and having a personal vehicle speeds up the process.You can level up, add perks, buy weapons for your crew members to make them more effective in combat. Secondary resources include beer, liquor, firearms. You use firearms to assault enemy businesses, perform drive-by or simply open weapons store for profit. Beer and liquor can be sold for profit, complete missions, influence certain characters. Some businesses require steady amount of beer / liquor to be profitable.Some businesses work better depending on your Liked / Feared amount. You gain Liked and Feared rating by building structures that boost either of those stats. Hostile actions increase Feared rating as well, but also increase your Heat level, that eventually will attract police investigation.Game may feel repetitive few hours in, as you basically do same thing on every mission. Personally I really liked how game looks and sounds, especially the music and voice acting.			"

												Neutral Review.This game highly lacks.. Stuff. There isn't a whole lot to do, only six maps all of which are very small and only a few action maps (where the combat takes place.) Many reviews claim it lacks in technicalities but I think it all works out great, it just lacks content. This game especially isn't worth anything over $20, it's crazy to think that this was a $60 game. It just isn't there it feels like a browser game honestly. Sandbox mode is horrible, you're best off just sandboxing in the campaign - because in sandbox mode, even though you may have everything set to easy some how the rival gang takes over the city within minutes and it's a pain to expand as they already have everything and the minute you establish something they take it over. A little more customization would've been nice as well on your character.If it had more content, larger map and just an overall enhancement to everything this game would be great. The soundtrack is awesome as is the setting, gameplay and even the combat is pretty well done once you get the hang of it. It is a fun game to casually relax and play, works at your own pace and is pretty laid back with relaxing music to jive to so it is initially fun but after awhile you'll start to see how much it lacks and what it could've been then it just makes you sad and want to stop playing. Hell even the voice acting is amazing and so are the graphics, honestly it's probably some of the best voice acting I've heard.Not recommended unless you get this game for under $10 or free.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I tried and I tried, but ultimately there is too much wrong with this game for me to give it a positive review.The maps are too small, it's quite easy to take over a map.The dialogue in combat constantly repeats itself.  So much so that I muted it while playing.The one issue that for me made this game completely unplayable was the combat mode.  It's beyond frustrating to shoot at an enemy that is right beside you and miss him with both shots that you have for a turn.  It just made the game frustrating as in ""give me a break"" and not frustrating because it is challenging.Why can't a software company make a great gangster game?!?!?!?			"

												Personally, I enjoy this game. The ""Story Mode"" Can get very annoying though, Each time you complete a chapter you have to start again in a new place, Rebuilding your empire all over again. But, the one thing that makes this game redeem itself in my opinion is the online, yes, its dead, but if you play with a friend its very enjoyable. You can upgrade your gangsters, buy them new weapons and unlock new perks. It's quite hard to actually complete the online missions at first, but once you buy decent charactors and weapons it gets easier. the online gameplay is simmilar to the Civilisation series, in terms of turn based movement and attacks. Wouldnt buy this game for its full price, but i had it with all the DLC for £6 so it wasnt even a big spend. Really worth playing, check it out for yourself.			"

												Have to say after buying, I would recommend caution in deciding to purchase this game.I bought it, and because of how it's designed and their lack of support, I can't play it.First off, mostly likely different from every other single player game in your steam library, you will have to create an account and log in to play this game. This means registering and verifying your email address. To play an offline game. Yes, unlike how 90% of the industry does it.Also keep in mind this was originally a Facebook game. So I can only guess what all that means in terms of what ratrace/paywall/in game purchase nightmares might await in line with how most Facebook games work. I can only guess, yaknow, cuz 4 hours later I still can't play the game because I can't login, because their server isn't sending confirmation emails, and Kalypso's support doesn't answer emails.DO NOT RECOMMEND.

												This game is fun, very fun but to the right person, it's a criminal management/strategy game based in early 1900. It is worth a try but not worth $20 I recommend going to♥♥♥♥♥and buying it there and giving it a try it's around $3. It is worth $3 it isn't full of content, it holds a decent amount but it doesn't hold a huge amount. Most of the content is in the story not in the missions. I believe there is a lot of potential for modding in this game a lot can be done to make this game incredible.Side notesMultiplayer is deadHas Random Number Generater that feels like crap (missed 3 %75 shots in a row)			"

												Omerta requires creating an Account / login before you can play. This has not been made clear on the Shop-Page (Steam), so here's the warning for you. I'm currently not willing to play this game. Not being told that I need to register before I buy the game makes me feel being cheated. BTW: I read somewhere that blocking Omerta with your firewall allows you to skip the registration, but that doesn't seem to work.[Edit] After reading posts of other annoyed users, I found out, that there actually is a note on the Steam Shop-Page. Well.. it's just not exactly standing out or anything. It's a small note on the side-bar .. ""requires 3rd party DRM - free kalypso account"" or something alike.Well .. I'm not the only one who feels tricked - even if they hide a small note on the shop-page.			"

												After 14 hours, I feel that I can safely say that what most people said about this game is true: It's probably better to avoid unless you it's on a great sale.The ""strategic planning"" is hype shallow and based on a random supply/demand cycle. Your success really has no bearing on anything either. The turn based fights are fun but the AI can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times. The RPG aspect of gang management is satisfactory but again is very shallow.It really is trying to be 3 games in one but generally fails at all of them. "

												This game was a lot of fun. I expected a lot more out of it when I first purchased it. One of my biggest let downs was that each chapter requires you to start over. The game should allow you to build up in one city then carry over the business and build a ""family"" over a larger area expanding. It would allow for turf wars. Also it should let you ""outline"" your family. As a mob boss you should be able to shape your organization based on your own ideas. For instance if you do not like prostitution or drugs don't capatilize on those industries allowing rival families to tap into that capital. The game felt to lineral. I would really like to see more out of this game. Looking forwars to a second game to come out that focuses more on strategy and molding the family. A lot of potential, fun play through the first go... A lot more could come from this game.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. Despite everyone hating on this, I found it to be quite entertaining. What broke this game for me are the bugs. Played Sandbox mode (easy settings, no cops) 2nd day into it, cops launch an investigation on my operations (interesting considering the cops should be disabled). Paid off the cops, did a drive-by on a rival gang's speakeasy. Next day the rival gang attacked my house. after the second restart, my camera view stopped working. Restared again, seemed fixed. managed to repel the attack without losing anyone. Screen loads back to the main map, I can scroll, but I can't control neither my characters nor my assets. Tried loading and realaoding the game, no fix. The one game that I managed to get ahead in a little bit, and it breaks...Great game imo as long as you dont mind the bugs and crashes.			"

Some say its repetative but as most of these games are TACTICAL I would say its not. Yes you aquire a part of Atlantic City, build it up to your specifactions (such as Tropico, CIV) recruit team members and be a proper Gangster. But each level brings its own difficulty, challenges and new squad members.This is totally my type of game and i only wish there were more like it. If you love the above mentioned games then this is for you. Afterall we all love to be crime lords right? Just look at the success of GTA. Enjoy.			"

												I got this game for free, and still feel like I paid too much for it. It's a real shame, because I really wanted to enjoy it - the concept is great, and it has most of what it needs to  be XCom-meets-business-sim set in Prohibition Era New Jersey.The combat is lackluster, the business sim elements are repetitive, and the characters are two-dimensional. What made me finally give up was the realization that the one Jewish character in the game had no other character traits than ""cheapskate"" - I'm not really interested in anti-Semitic caricatures in my video games.

												I play games of this genre, this game is better than city builder games, which is that you don't need to waste 2 hours for ever 1 hour planning what you are going to build. You have 3 types of building groups joints, premises, and constructions. joints are cash making buildings, premises are production buildings, and constructions are expensive high tier buildings.Combat is simple and straight forward, take turns, get into position, target, use abilities, and complete the objective. The base game lacks a variety of prison maps, but the Japanese Incentive DLC drastically improves the combat map varieties.The stats of characters do not impact the performance of characters on the strategic map (moving around the map and building buildings), however character classes DO impact how well they execute their actions. Masterminds finish quests faster, Grifters +populace favor, enforcers +fear, hitmen prevent giving you attention for doing most criminal acts. There's a severe lack of variety in classes, Plenty of characters however.This game's single player campaign is pretty fun, with a story that is filled with gangster drama, it took me 150 hours to complete all the missions +bonus dlc missions AND the expansion (still a bit heart broken).Music is very nice, it gives that prohibition era vibe with blues and big bands. What would have made the game nicer is if choice was if the story wasn't linear, because the endings were severely underwhelming after what you accomplish.The maps are small for a city builder game and this might sound as if it's a terrible idea for a city builder game, until you realize how god painful it is to move scroll from location to location or click on a mini map multiple times.This game's strategic play will seem dull after you finish the base campaign, but the Japanese Incentive expansion makes it much more fun and intense, where you're up against an AI (playing the game on insane, the AI really knows how to knock you over). Outside the highest aggressiveness the AI will not seem very hard to beat if you're used to playing strategy games. In most scenarios turtling will make you win, but let's be honest that's almost all strategy games.This game was worth buying at it's current price of this genre.I don't know of any game that mixes REAL TIME strategic city building and light version of turn based combat seen in games such as Xcom.

												TL ; DR : Nice concept but weak game in all its aspects, repetitive and overpriced.You will read here and there that Omerta suffered from a lot of backlash. Is it justified ? Mostly, yes. But first, what's this all about ?You start as a sicilian pursuing his own version of the American dream : becoming a Don in Atlantic City, durin the prohibition era. Of course there are already mafia representatives here, but without big surprises, it won't stop your ascension.The setting is refreshing and of course reminiscent of the Godfather, with all the shadowy dealings hidden under a face of respectability and honourable principles, while never being half as interesting as the Corleone's story.There's humor here and there, some sound attempts, but in the end, nothing deep.For Omerta, you see, is really a light game, in all its aspects. Even for a management game, the graphics are leaning towards mediocre, with the city mostly lifeless, save some cars and silent citizens. The crux of the game, the management part, also lacks greatness. You take over/buy premises, joints, construct buildings (boxing areas, speakeasy to sell beer and liquor, casino, bookmaker...), managing your income in both dirty and clean money. Unless you have specific objectives, the activities you'll make will likely be globally the same mission after mission : there's no serious planning to build a solid economy. You have to be wary of the heat (police interest for your activities), but even if it reaches 5 stars, a small bribe will wipe it all away. Besides, you gain money quite easily, so sending your gang for burglars, heists, etc., is not so beneficial. You also have queries, refreshed every now and often, wich is just soulless trading- and there are only three resources : beer, liquor and firearms. It begs for variety, but there is not much to find in Omerta, wich is commiting a grave sin : being repetitive and prone to bore you.Why ? Well, because of all the waiting. You don't manage much (once buildings are owned, you can do two upgrades, stopping or abandonning the activity is a weird choice), the cash flows in without much input on your part. So you wait for the queries to be done, the buildings to be acquired or built, the money to roll in, your gang members to accomplish their tasks. No speed button, by the way !Then you have the combats, a breeze of fresh air. I saw someone comparing it to X-Com, but let's be serious : they don't play in the same category. It's a light tactical, with different classes of ""units"", special powers, different types of actions, more than the bare minimum but still nothing stellar. Cover is of some use, there's a morale system (without a great impact), in the end, as for the management, serious thinking is not needed. Battles go as smoothly as the rest. Still, it breaks the monotonous vibe of the title...Good luck finding someone in multiplayer mode, and the replay value is more or less a moot point, with all the routine and lack of challenge. In a way it's quite soothing. But when you know that Kalypso, of Tropico fame, is behind the project, one cannot help but think they didn't put much effort into it !All in all, the potentiel is drowned into a sea of blandness. I'd advise not to try unless on -75% discount.A bit or irony that a game named Omerta, ""code of silence"", has itself rusted away without a sound... "

The old Gangsters game from the 90s is better than this♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is just like Tropico but with most parts thrown away and a gangster style thrown upon it. The combat is fun for a while but in the end it is worse than the old xcom or jagged alliance games, or even old classic fallout tactics. The coop would be fun if it wasn't for the fact that there are only two levels and one of the levels freezes up all the time, and the cops spawn in almost the exact same locations each time.DO NOT BUY.

												Seems like an okay XCOM tactical style game, maybe not as much depth but pretty decent all the same... can't grumble for £2.99 for the Gold edition on Bundlestars.			"

												The only good things about this game are the setting and maybe the graphics.Everything else sucks. It's very repetitive and the turn based combat is just really badly designed. I mean how do you screw that up? It's not like there's been decades worth of good turn based strategy games already out. /sTotally not worth the money even on sale.			"

												Rating: four scary pizzas out of ten.Don't let the nasty red thumbs-down fool you; I did enjoy my time in this game. I just don't think I'd ever actually recommend it to anyone for any particular reason, and, well, that's what the rating is for. I'm also blatantly not the target audience. But here's how I spent my time as a wannabe pacifist in the city of gangsters.The Boss arrived in Atlantic City with a few simple aims: to provide food and medicine to the downtrodden, to make boatloads of money, to sell the scariest pizzas in town, and to be loved. Within minutes of meeting him, I could tell that the Boss was a somewhat insecure man, desperate to assert his importance as he made his mark. ""There's a reason I'm the boss,"" said the only worker in the entire organisation to himself. ""A real boss isn't afraid of grunt work,"" he said to the zero other people available to do grunt work for him.Sadly, soon after settling into Virginia Avenue, it became clear there was a local criminal gang involved in all sorts of foul business, and so, though he was ultimately a man of peace ,happiness, and pizza, the Boss realised he would have to either perish, or take out the gang first by striking at their hideout. The trouble was, he had to find it first.Hmm, he thought, looking around the area. Maybe – just maybe – it's that building there, diametrically opposite my hideout, that looks exactly the same as my hideout? To make sure, he still needed to ask a guy who to ask about someone who'd know who to ask about whether that was the place he thought it was, but it wasn't long before his hunch was proven true.With a collection of guns people had handed in at his new pawn shops, and a bunch more that that nice man from the army had going spare, he got ready to storm the enemy hideout. But this plan would need friends to work, so he put together a team of allies the same way any sane employer would: by seeing who had the most tragic backstories. That ruled out a lot of nasty stabby people, but there were enough left over after that. Squiggs and Happy were clearly victims of their circumstances. The haunted former doctor O'Connell and jazz-loving Walker Johnson – both brought a tear to the eye. Brigitte's backstory wasn't that tragic to be honest, but she STOLE HER OWN BIPLANE and STILL USES IT FOR STUFF so she was invited anyway, in the offchance that the Boss could have a shot in it.The assault began. They won! Somehow, nobody, not even on the other side, died. ""Well done, friends!"" the Boss probably said, ""But now we're broke, so you're all fired.""And so the Boss got back to work. The enemy gang gone, several vacant properties to build in, but only about nine dollars to his name. He took out a loan, started earning small amounts of money, and carried on.In the new-found peace around Virginia Avenue, he slowly and without fuss made his way back up to a position of power. As soon as he had enough capital, the Boss opened a soup kitchen to feed the locals. He felt guilty about firing all his friends, so re-hired them despite not desperately needing them. Property was purchased. More soup kitchens appeared. He opened a pizzeria, which apparently people found intimidating. Rather enjoying the scary reputation that the pizzas gave him, the Boss bumped up his dark image even further, exclusively by paying a drunk national stereotype to sing songs about how scary he was. Eventually, the Boss sent O'Connell, who had long ago departed from his medical career after failing to save a child's life, and had him establish a clinic for the locals, thinking it might help reconnect the poor doctor with his old ideals. ""Worth going to hell for,"" said the proud doctor as he opened the clinic.The Boss's remaining days in Virginia Avenue were spent compulsively buying up property, and repeatedly redecorating his home with nicer and nicer rooms and flowers. If only I could do this more often and with more control, he thought, and then he went to play the Sims. The End.			"

												Wow so I bought this game recently but when I went to start up you have to give them your email so you can receive their spam and junk mail.  Needless to say to even start the game you have to register an email.  So I did so, but after you complete that you have to wait for a confirmation email.  Here I am a day later and I still haven't received a confirmation email.  This is absolutely terrible and basically has killed any want of me actually trying this game out,  What a waste.			"

												Copied from a GOG review by DIABLITO, but I thing it sums up the game perfectly. ""To me at least, this was a complete waste of money. The so called ""sandbox"" mode is just you spending some time to ""beat"" the level.There is no competition, no one to fight, no trying to muscle in on you. You just build up, paying off police now and then to lose ""heat"" until you own everything in the *miniscule* maps available.If you enjoy, short, predictable games that you can win with ease then you'll like this.If you were hoping for a gangster strategy game...there is no strategy in this, non what so ever. Strategy, requires opponents, what this game has feels more like quests than anything else.""			"

												after playing it for 2 hours i quickly found my self stuck on the last tutorial mission. with nothing but a man with a knife and a gun wielding man. the mission was simple. fend off the attacking gangsters from your safehouse. my plan was to keep them at the door as there was ok amout of cover there. but yet still it was frustrating for me. my gun man didnt do much damage and kept missing the unarmed melee pickpockets just running up and apllying a load of debuffs before he got shot down fromt the outside meanwhile he was in cover. my melee knife gangster would quickly get mowed down by the horde of pickpockets and the pistol wielder outside of the house and would barely survive more than 4 turns after being spotted by the first enemy. i tried to make a new gangster that wielded a gun. but still the melee just rushed to me to debuffe and kill me. meanwhile the enemy pistol man just gunned my team down from ''cover''. even on the easiet difficulty i couldnt do anything but watch as my team got thier♥♥♥♥♥kicked. the only solution was to save the game and auto resovle. but where is the fun in that? the final straw for me was when i had just begun a new plan. i was sure if i took cover in my starting room and ambushed the enemy i could surely get a chance. but it was frustrating as an enemy spotted me through a wall only to debuff and of course kill my other gangster. i am currently waiting for a refund. as the game mediocrity started to show. i usally like strategey games but this was just too much for me. maybe i just suck at the game but this was the last mission of a tutorial and it honestly shouldnt be too hard. but what bugged me to write this review was that i had no problem with the demo i played and frankly i think the game is too hard. but on another note the mangement part was also kinda boring as you just buy a thing that makes X. and then you make a buidling that sells thing X. and the obecjtives are pretty much just GATHER ENOGUH THING X AND INCREASE THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF Y! after a mission you rinse and repeat until you get caught by the police and throw money at them to make them go away of just win the mission and start over. would not recommend unless you can win XCOM in half an hour using only one team members bare hands on the hardest diffuclty.

												DO NOT PURCHASE!!!I read several reviews saying mixed things about this game, and from the sound and look i thought how bad can it be? ...Very! the game is slow and linear with no real strategy concept, it gives no real sense of being a mob boss, wheeling and dealing and generally organising your crime empire. Its just simply rent a building (which are preset and very limited in comparison to the number of potentials), put a business in it, gain a little money (can be dirty or clean, but doesnt seem to make alot of difference to be honest), rent another building, put a business in it...repeat as necessary. Combat is another kettle of fish altogether! It must take effort to make a combat system this bad. I saw it and thought classics like shining force or X-COM...nope. It is turn based but it is so heavily AI favoured you may aswel just auto resolve every fight. Your characters are so bad at shooting that an AI man with bare hands can run toward 2/3 of you in the open and manage to get a hit on you before you gun him down. Not to mention that the hit he will get will be ridiculously overpowered leaving your character with a persistent problem for the remainder of the game. You can also sacrifice a member of your team as a support function such as assassin or to prevent the AI from fighting as effectively. I havent as yet seen any advantage to losing a team member for the support, in several games my assassin lasted 2 turns before just stopping, and he didnt hit anyone in those. The other major annoyance is that everytime you complete an area and move to the next, other than having a little extra cash you have to start again from scratch...i dont get the point to this decision, it makes the game even shorter than it already is, like a lot of very short skirmish games. There is no continuity to the game dynamic. Overall very dissapointingSlowLinearPoorly completed for a professional gameCombat is sluggish and boring, aswel as vastly AI powered.No continuity I so wanted to be happy with this, I saw a potential for a real rags to riches, non to Don build your gang family and rule the city, all set in a classic gangster 20s backdrop during the prohibition. But there is just no content or substance.Apologies to anyone who does like this game, there are good points, but to someone who loves turn based 4X style games like the Civ series and even what content was in games like X-COM, Omerta just feels incomplete on the content front.

I spent 24 hours on this game and completed the main campaign on Hard difficultyI came to Omerta after I completed X Com and wanted another turn based strategy game to try. This game is a big disappointment for those that want to get into the genre and doesn't even come close to X Com on a gameplay perspective.While the concept of having Gangstas might be fun to begin with, it is hard to overlook some flaws.Its extremely hard to find pros for this game when compared to a more refined product such a X Com. My biggest gripes with Omerta are:- City management becomes repetitive. After a few hours, you will always follow the exact same process of trying to weed out other gangs using the exact same methods.- You are only limited to a maximum of 4 party members for each mission despite the fact you can have a roster of 20+.  Its a big waste of potential as a lot of the gangsters you will never use as they are inferior. You are not encouraged to experiement as some weapons/gangstas are always superior than others.-Stupid AI. Even on Hard difficulty, the AI rarely work together to bring your ganstas down e.g they rarely focus fire. The toughness usually comes from AI having superior numbers (vs your 4 gangstas) rather than actually being smart- Bad Voice Acting. Its really sub par for a $40 game.- Price. In no way is this worth $40. It may be worth a shot when it is discounted to $10 but at full price it is a massive rip off. "

A lot of games are repetitive but, a good story makes you forget that.I thought it would be cool but, its so so to me.  Turn based combat and, it reminds me of ""Gangsters 2 Vendetta"".I hoped the game would be a bit like that but, it isnt. So far its ok but, i wouldnt recommend it. Its a matter of taste i think.

												Omerta has alot of potentiol but in its current form is not worth its price tag.The overall campaign is well done but the LENGTH is horrible. YOu get currently about 15-25 hours of gameplay out of this game tops. The Sandbox mode which should add rpelay value is distubingly rigged. The AI  in sandbox mode simply has unlimited everything  even on the easiest settings. So unless you like getting punched in the face repeatedly , the current sandbox mode is a joke. Currently there are also game ending bugs that stop all progress, which seems to have started with their last patch. Even though alot of people will test games for free, they do not bother having anyone play through their content apparently before throwing it in. I am very dissapointed, the game has alot going for it as a BASE for what a game could start from. But it lacks so much in game content length, and the terrible Thinking through of the sandbox AI that just pretty much slaps you in the face as soon as your start playing,, that its currently  only worth paying maybe , MAYBE 5 bucks in my opinion. For 39.99 i expect something better than 15 hours of gameplay, poorly designed Ai, and gamebreaking bugs that stop all progression.2/5 stars			"

												Now this game was a poc definitely. Real time was not the way to make this game. Had it been all turned based it would have been great. But, the enemy AI wouldn't even let you get started to play with drive by shootings and stealing what you had gotten so far. I was highly disappointed. But, there's always a but....the combat engine is pretty good as it was turned based. But that is all that was good about the game to me.			"

												Just an awful game to play.  I wish I could return it for anything else.  What a waste of 30.00.  Clunky playback.  Bad graphics.  Charater development is also another area of concern.  Reminds me of a black and white game form the DOS days of game play.			"

												I was really looking forward to this, but sadly, it's just not that good. It reminds me of an Android or iOS game. Not something you would find on a PC. It's just click and repeat, over and over, every level. The only part that is semi decent is the combat, but even that feels clunky. Save your money. Even if it's on sale			"

												At first interesting, then repetitive, boring, and annoying.Omerta plays out in missions, where you get property and build a supply chain economy to keep the money rolling in. This is extremely easy to do, and after the tutorial you won't change a thing throughout the game. This strategy is ""Don't do the mission that triggers something"" and buyup/build everything. This is even less fun than Settlers 7's repetitive setup.Combat is nothing like XCom. I've played many turn based games, and this is the WORST combat by far. Enemies just run out into the open to shoot you, or grab cover on a wall with their back to you and then shoot. Hit percents are strange, where you can hit a guy behind full cover easily, yet have a super low chance to hit someone two feet away around a corner. I could go on and on about annoyances of this combat. Not remotely fun.Not Recommended.			"

												I really liked the old PC game, Gangsters: Organised Crime, and even the more casual Legal Crime. So when I saw the trailer for this game I got very excited.That's why it's such a shame that after all the nice looking graphics and smooth music - the game simply just does not deliver. The real snub is that it just gets boring fast; lots of repitition, with each level following the same actions with little variety in the middle. Ultimately they took a great concept and simplified it to death. The Godfather games involve more strategy than this.All that being said. If this is on offer, and I mean a great offer, pick it up and you'll have a few hours of fun before it begins to get repetitive.			"

												Bargain bin Garbage.  This game must be the most confused game ever in the history of gaming.  Its got some weird xcom like thing for combat with a weird tropico city management thing and neither of which are any good.  If you build a pizza shop in this game everyone fears you, this makes no sense everyone should like you if you build a pizza shop.  Who are all these people who are afraid or hate pizza so much?  Kalypso makes lots of great games, no idea why a dev who makes great games like tropico would get into bargain bin game making but that is what this is.  Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00  (This game hates people who like pizza, dont buy it support equal rights for pizza people! #Justice4Pizza)			"

												Way to go, Omerta. You've made gangsters with tommy guns boring. It's a cool idea, no doubt (who doesn't like a story about mafia gangsters?), but it's just not that great. If you've seen one level, you've seen 'em all (with some minor variations on the same theme). It's just a boring game.			"

												I really wanted to like it.  I really really did.  I wanted to purchase this prior to release but I held off because it looked too rough.  It became available on Humble and I swiped it up immediately.  Then I played it.  I'm very, very glad I didn't pay full price for it.  The best parts of the game are the music and the rain sound effects.  The graphics come in next.The characters' voices are unpolished at best, annoying at worst (ESPECIALLY in combat).  Speaking of which, combat is clunky and unforgiving.  You take the time to plan out a strategy and take cover, and then the enemy runs up to you without any thought of cover or survival themselves and shoots you.  The tutorial is quick...  too quick.  Do this, do this, do this...  now save up a bunch of money.  Oh but look out, you're being attacked.I might give the game one more attempt but I suspect it will be uninstalled soon.UPDATE:  Tried again.  Uninstalling it now.  Same crappy combat issues.  Going back to Shadowrun as at least the combat there makes sense.  This game is pointless.  I'm glad I got it on sale, I'm terribly disappointed though because I had such high hopes for this game.  Such promise.  Such potential.  Such crap.			"

												First, let's be clear about Omerta. It is not really much more than an empire based game. There is very little building involved, much more establishing properties. Battles aren't really all that exciting, but playable. This is a decent game. It's not entirely horrible, but I would't go out of my way to bring it up in conversation either.  I only rate it a thumbs down because I personally would not reccommend it. I would much rather prefer Mafia : City of Lost Haven or Mafia II			"

The overworld map is kinda lackluster, but it's pretty easy to breeze through if you get bored. the interface is easy to play with and it does invoke the era you're playing in and the base building is actually a nice litte touch that gives the players a sense of progress beyond watching the numbers go up.

												Really feels like it could be ""Boardwalk Empire - The Game"".Fun city management/tactical combat sim.  Deep?  Not very, but enough to keep me interested.  Pretty satisfying when you get things humming along well enough to start buying up every single piece of property on the map.  Take over hotels, casinos, buy up houses to generate rental income, edge out the competition with a drive-by or three...I got it on sale for a few bucks.  I almost never get the complete/gold packs for games because I have ADD for games.  I play them once for an hour or two and move on to the next.  I actually regret not spending a few more dollars for the gold version.  I've had this game for 3 days and have 17 hours in it.  That's unheard of for me.  The game is NOT worth full price, but if you're into this sort of thing I'd say it's worth $15-20ish.			"

That literally ruined the game, it could've been an awesome new mobster game but no. It's like playing chess. If I wanted to play chess I would. I've always wanted a hovered view styled mobster\criminal game. The last one I can remember is Gangland which was fun. Thumbs down for this game because of it being turn  based & I highly recommend you don't get this.			"

Every. Single. Time.- tactical fighting has an terrible structure troughout, cover is 100% useless, since EVERYONE can run AROUND the enemy EVERYTIME, and everbody DOES it and hits him in the back. Every. Single. Time.I usually trust metracritic.I usually don´t play games under 75.But EVERY single time, when I think to myself ""Ah come on, it can´t be that bad."" Then I try a game in the 60~ score area.And it sucks.Every. Single. Time.Trust me, trust metacritic. Do not and never play anything under 75.			"

												This game gets some pretty bad reviews.It is not as bad as people make out.I got the Gold Edition for $8.00 on sale so it was worth it for me, but if it were $30+ I might be a bit disappointed.The gameplay is good, I am a big sucker for gangster games and turn based strategies.The turn based combat system is a bit different to ususal but after a few minutes you become familiar with it and it is pretty enjoyable and challenging. Combat is easy enough if you make a point of earning a lot of money and equipping your characters with decent weapons, there are a few available per map so it takes a while to get a good loadout.My only gripe is you cant slow down and speed up time which would help with the economic side of the game, but if you can handle the lowish speed, it is easy and enjoyble setting up businesses and watching the cash flow in, and blowing it on cars and gear.I would rate it maybe a 6.5 out of 10, but I definitely recommend you give it a go if the play style and settng appeal to you. It definitely isn't a ""Must Not"" as a lot of people say it it.			"

												Well my personal problem with this is that it's MOSTLY non-combat segments that you'll be doing which is just managing your gang and operations. That turned me off by a lot. However the actual combat (when they actually occur) is very fun in a classic Fallout, XCOM kind of way where ranged and melee attacks are enjoyable to strategize with and you are able to level up your posse. As they level up you can raise specific stats to the character to suit your practical or impractical needs. Unfortunately there's less of that and too much of managing my cheap beer so that was a downer for me. Not to mention you have to create an account to even play the single player. Just make a username & password, put your e-mail then activate your account via e-mail. It's simple but UGH			"

												A very Fun ""little"" game for inbetween! I like strategy Games and for me at least this is a real challenge sometimes. Graphics are okay but the gameplay of this game shines! I had hours of fun by just playing the story! Even though its very repetitive and the story is somewhat ""short"" (depending on how fast you rushed through), this game is pure fun!The Multiplayer isnt any different than the normal mode: Move your character, shoot, wait a round or two... More intersting makes this  the different gamemodes, but all in all the MP is the same!			"

												I really wanted to like this game, I really did.  Unfortunately outside of combat it's basically an iPhone F2P game, and while inside of combat could be fun, in the second tutorial fight (at the end of the tutorial level, which I couldn't save in), I had two guys to four, was unable to hit a single guy, and was sniped to death by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a pistol with perfect aim at an impossible angle outside a window.  Unwilling to suffer through the excrutiating tutorial again, I gave Omerta the Cement Galoshes- now it's takin' a bath at the bottom of the pier with a rat burrowing out of its stomach.			"

It's fairly well executed on the core concepts, though it lacks some polish that keeps it from being absolutely great (such as UI, some translation issues, and some rough edges in the gameplay that might just be tough to solve -- such as ending a mission prematurely or not knowing when it ends, and needing to know you should buy all the guns before moving on to a new mission).

												Omerta: City of GangstersPros-#1.Mafia based games are cool#2.Different ways to make money both legally and illegally#3.The graphics are ok#4.The music is okCons-#1.Is there any Italian mafia family that has female and non Italian members?I could believe they might hire one freelance or work with one in their crew but they would never be an actual member.Kind of like Henry Hill from GoodfellasI guess if they do not consider them members just in your crew that is more based on the boss allowing it, they just could never be madeI think they should of made this game so some of the crew you hire they make it clear that the full blooded Italian men can be made and everyone else can not since that was realistic.So it could be a perk to recruit them for that reason.#2.I never saw actual police in the cityYou might find out that deputy so and so lives in this building but they never leave itI have played mafia games similar to this that had a police station or several if the map was big and they would actually walk and drive around the cityIn that game if I was to go and kill someone on the streets the police would go to the location of the murder sometimes not always.You could kill the cops or bribe their boss of their stationIn this game just doing certain actions raises your heat level.I do not have a problem with that in theory but it would be better with police and FBI and DEA in the map and after you do stuff you see them check it outYou could have the option to kill them,bribe them,plant evidence somewhere else ectIn the game I am comparing this to you could blow up the police station and city hall and your rivals buildings#3.The combat sucksThe concept of what they were trying to do with combat could be fun but how it is in this game sucksI would of liked it more with real time point and click combat where we can buy weapons and put them with our crew.They simply would attack who you click on using the weapon they have and we would not control how they use cover if there is any.I know that is really simplistic and some would find that boring but I would of preferred that to thisI disliked the combat in this game so much I just wanted to auto resolve it and let the computer do it for me.It allowed that a few times but later on there was no context it would allow me to do itThis was to me the worst part of the game#4.The lack of an enemy in the main mapJust as there are no police there is no enemy roaming the main mapThey should of allowed us to hire and our enemies to hire lower level henchman/crew bodyguards to guard specific buildings or get in cars and patrol and do drive by shootingsYou know actually attack in real time combat in the main map.Even if it is turn based if you told some crew to drive to set location and you set their aggressive level to max if they see any enemy or police on the way there to just kill and chase them that would be realisticIf you set their level on say defensive they only shoot if shot at but will probably reach the locationIn a real life situation if a mafia boss or police officer wants to kill you or arrest you and they know where you are and you were willing to fight to the death if they tried wouldn't you either# 1. Have bodyguards in front of that building and in it as well if you could afford it#2. Try and hide and go to a new location and take some of those bodyguards with youThis game should have petty gangs which it has but you don't see them on the main map and there should also be large rival mafia families and sometimes multiple ones in the same main mapWe could kill them,bribe them make them so weak they become our ally,plant evidence against them so their boss goes to jail which could slow them down in some waysSteal their cars,booze,weapons ectThey could have missions start where there is one boss who is your friend and you see where he lives vs 2 bigger stronger ones.You could turn on him or you could share with him it is more variety#5.The people walking around the city in the main mapYou can not click on them.You can not kill them.You can not see what they think of any mafia in the city.You can not see why they like you or fear youYou could literally erase them all and it wouldn't change anything#6.Your crew members abilitiesNow they tried in this game and I give them that but they could of added so much more.In the game gangsters 2 and even in the game godfather 2 your crew can have more special perksThey should of tried to improve this more#7.Improving your base/hideoutI could see the reasoning behind paying so much money to allow for better illegal business options.It makes the game more challenging and you can feel like you accomplished something when you finally get the best money making illegal business goingWhat is the point of upgrading the fence?What is the point of getting a pool?Does it improve anything other than how it looks?I don't think it doesNow in theory I have no problem with customizing your base just for looks but why not take it the next step and let us customize how the boss of our family looks like in Tropico?#8.The camera angles in the main mapI would of liked to zoom in much closer and zoom out more#9.The map optionsPlay the game Gangsters 2 and there is a map option where you are like a general seeing the whole battlefield move in real timeIt also makes it easier to see which boss controls what territoryYou would have to see it to really understand but it improves games like theseThe Bottom Line -Omerta: City of Gangsters is a worse version of older mafia games.They should of stolen all the good ideas from the game Gangsters 2 and they should of used the concept of clicking on the everyone to see their point of view like Tropico since this is made by the same peopleIf it is based on combat I would prefer to play the Godfather or Mafia games over this.Gangsters 2 combat was simplistic but it was better than OmertaNow if after reading this if you still want to buy it DO NOT PAY MORE THAN $5 for this gameThat is all it is worth.I paid $10 and I regret it and anyone who paid more than that I feel sorry forMy 2 centsDan			"

												Two reasons why I don't recommend this game (boy was i looking forward to this title, big disappointment coming from a gangsters 2 fan)1) Kalypso account needed to play, even for offline use.  I can not put into words how bad of a taste this leaves in my mouth.  Spend money on a game with the expectation to play it, load the game, and you're presented with a screen that does not let you go past it until you give them you email.  Even for offline play.  What a slap in the face to the customers, AFTER recieving their money.2) SHORT, SMALL MAPS!.  The mapsize is TINY and once you expand into the couple of other neighborhoods (yes its that small), the game is over.  now what do you do, start over? just so you can rule the few blocks that is the entirety of the map?  Stupid.  (Disclaimer: as of august 2014, I have ALL of the DLC.  maps are still tiny)In conclusion, if someone from kalypso ever reads this, you guys seriously need to stop this♥♥♥♥♥♥with the kalypso launcher account.  I already paid for the game, have it bound to my steam account.  The last thing I want to do is screw around with some stupid account with a publisher.  (Just remember how bad the response was for the new simcity requiring you to be online, this is just as bad)  Quit that♥♥♥♥♥♥  I'm not buying another one of your games unless I see a review that says there is no stupid kalypso launcher.  Way to♥♥♥♥♥♥all over the gaming industry.			"

												Game is good for a price tag of around 15$ or so.Played the normal campaign which took me around 15 hours or so, the game can become repetetive but it's one of those games that you play once here and there, I don't see anyone finishing this from start to finish in one settingGameplay is a good blend of Top down strategy shooter ( Made me think of Xcom ) and a economy builder , where you need to get money from buildings and such.Only hard part about the game is it's combat battles, and the last mission, the economy part is not that hard and you're usually waiting for your next input of money.All in all I still recommend that anyone that likes City building or resource management , with a small blend of combat to pick this up , I enjoyed it till the end.

												Although simple to play and lacking deeper strategic simulation the game is generally fun and engaging. Combat is fairly simple but the characters you can take to the fight can be customised in several ways to suit a particular play style or to support each other as an effective whole. For a low price this is a good game well worth your time.			"

												I have played this game on Xbox already but could not resist when it was in the sale.Nice turn based combat with various weapons and enemies, decent storyline and plenty of things to manage.Anyone who enjoys this type of game / people who enjoyed Boardwalk Empire should pick this game up.Its worth buying at full price, I bought in the sale due to having on console already.8/10 (Only bad point is the main storyline is a little short, otherwise 9/10)			"

While the Town wide planning is a chance to expand your Empire. Though you still gotta work your way up.			"

												Intro:So, instead of ducking this game down to a negative review, I will remain it at positive but tell you all about the good, the bad nad the ridiculous about this game.  In essense, this is another game that I would do better in person.  The combat system is what kills this game.  Last I knew, you don't don't even need courage to fire a gun, just need to be alive.  I feel bad for those who cannot hack the game in other to be able to see the ending.  You also won't get to play without creating an account.  Kalypso's now in my pile of ""Undesirable Gaming Companies to Avoid At All Cost"" along with Rockstar, UbiSoft, if I would do better in person, if I need to create an account and login to play and you ain't smart enough to build a proper difficulty function for a game, you suck as human being and don't deserve my money.The Good:This is a fun game I don't care what anyone says though, if you have cheats or a trainer.  I was skeptical at first despite the gross amount of negative reviews.  Ok it is a bit dated for this time but 2D will likely never die; because of its simplicity.  If you're looking for a Mafia type game that is very hands off but does has some basic (but odd) combat, this game is for you.  If anything it is a management game.  I played this game thinking it would never install, start or the game would be so terrible that even the biggest game douches couldn't possibly find fun.  I did though, this a great time killer.  It's not an alternative or a replacement for Mafia II but is a fun little time killer.  The hassle is little and once you get the hang of it, you'll want to explore the heck out of it.  Great setting, I love the atmosphere, feels like home.I hope they make an actual RPG game out of this, a sequel, maybe to even actually rival Mafia II... we need more Italian Mafia related games!!  If I do not rake in more hours on this than Mafia II I would be surprised.  Repetitive, simple, brainless and addictive but without a trainer I would have gien up and asked for a refund long ago.  So unless you want to spent money to see the ending then I would suggest staying away.  As said earlier, the only real downfall is the battle system and camplaign system, it never feels like you have the chance to do as as much as you want but there are many missions.  I find is rather stupid but in a way recreates reality well enough.  The more you go, the easier things get, make sure you chose the best possible support unit as support and it's a good idea to do full respecs when you have lots of money.  The ambiance, atmosphere and management wins this game.  I have yet to try the sandbox, I want to finish the story first.... it is so captivating!The Bad:It is rather dated for its time, built in 2013 and mostly 2D.  The map is odd to work with, it's either angular or straight which can get confusing.  All maps essentially look the same, kinda like a ""small maps but big buildings"" Sim City.  This would have benefited from a 3D universe but then those devs aren't that good; I wouldn't ask that much from them.  Thsi game starts from: 1- This is so cool!2- Those battles are stupid3- Managing a Mafia is fun though4- Wow, I'm getting better at battles5- I never have enough premises!!6- Making money is rather easy for a mafia7- Whoa-ho!!  Looks at this shotgun!!8- Ok, this is getting repetitive now but not in a bad way9- Clean money helps keep the heat low10- Why are those maps soo small?11- I never have enough contruction lots!!12- Wow, how can you miss 7 point blank shots in a row, best gun in the game, best guy weilding13- You know, I do a lot better in real life14- Games like this are why I cheat15- I never have enough distilleries!!... and the list goes on but I want to get back to playing. The Ridiculous:I think it's been said everywhere already but I will add on.  After you pass Michigan Ave and get around the Boardwalk, the game gives you no chance.  I have been gaming for decades and this battle system is the worst I ever seen.  It is turn based but not well made... turn based worst if it is well made, this is not.  On top of that, your own hits only land 40% where the enemy hits 75% of the time.  If i was running an arcade, I would lvoe this game because the house always wins.  I'm starting to think of opening an arcade and put up all the games that are made to never be won by normal means.  Instead of making an enjoyable game, with a normal difficulty curve and a normal XP point distribution, this would have been an A+ game that people would talk about... but no developers makes games for themselves then wonder why they get so many refunds and so many negative reviews; stuck up sods!The zoom never zooms out enough, I like seeing the whole city from a zoom out position.  The little map helps but I prefer a further zoom.  Another problem is that they stuck quest items in spots that are near impossible to get to, lots of blind spots make this game hard to deal with.  Battles also never really tell you how many enemies there are.  There is nothing to really heal yoruself, if there is you can only use it once per mission.I am running Windows 7 with XP support on an ultra spec 2013 laptop... Like a boss XDIf you're a fan of anything Italian Mafia, it's definitely worth a buy below $10; I got it for a lot less, so it was the best $5 I spent in 2015 on a game and I bu ya lto of $5 games, I don't keep them all though, this one, I will play again once I finish it.  Been about 40 hours now, taking my sweet♥♥♥♥♥ dora the explora time; so it is longer to complete than Mafia II which I can complete in less than a day now.PS: Yes, I do cheat games that take away from the enjoyment.  If I feel the developer is cheating with his code, I can cheat with mine and make us equal, so I can enjoy the game.  There are challenges I can go without but in this game, there are too many variables added that shouldn't be there anyways.  The game was made too tight, I loosen it up a bit.  I use a trainer for unlimited health.Conclusion: I recommend this game only if you have access to cheats or a trainer; which is sort of like a game genie.  I would recommend getting a membership with a trainer provider since so many games today aren't well made.  I'm an old school gamer and expect old school values in the games I buy... that's why I have not yet purchased TW3, they don't sell a full game on release.  Pre-Orders and DLC's are new school.... this game is new school, trying to be old school.  Don't wonder why this is rated so low everywhere on the internet.  People love this game but hate the way it was built.			"

												This game took me by surprise.  I love the mafia genre, but at first look the turn based action/movement point combat really turned me off from it.  I recanted that thought after actually playing it.  The majority of the game is a city management sim with a mafia twist.  The combat can be minimal or it can be the majority of the game depending on how you play.  The combat reminds me of the tile strategy rpg video games with the limited movement and actions per round.  They aren't really my thing, but it's really done well in Omerta.			"

												""Hmmm, City of Gangsters.... oh look, it's a period ganster game billed as a combination of XCom and Jagged Alliance and it's made by the same guys who made Tropico!  I love ALL of those games... how can this miss?(20 minutes after starting the game)Delete Local Content""Honestly, I had such high hopes for this game... I thought it might be like an updated and improved version of the 1998 Hothouse Creations game ""Gansters: Organize Crime"".  I think that's what they were trying to do, but the game play is too linear and the combat system is too clunky - in my first combat 'mission' I had 3 guys with pistols going against about 10 guys with shotguns, samurai swords and a machine gun (lots of samurai in New York in the 30s?).

												Played the demo, that convinced me to preorder. Not a flawless title, by any means. I was dissapointed how this developer handled the tropico series into 2-3, but they seemed to have learned a few lessons about what people enjoy in their games, and this game has a Kalypso media feel to it through and through. To describe the gameplay would be a mishmash of money management and tactical combat. To describe the money management, (a large part of the game) you essentially have zero expenses day to day, save gang wages, so there is no expenditures screen to ponder over. That said, bribery is a common element, and your primary expense to get da cops off your back. As for the combat, comparing it to Xcom is a bit unfair, and frequently brought up in reviews. It's more like jagged alliance, if that is at all fair. Gangsters have weapons, 3 abilities per weapon, move, whack, so on and so forth. It's straightforward, if a bit clunky. It feels like in a small way the combat was an afterthought, but combined with the streamlined money management bit, makes this a pretty decently fun title. :D			"

												So this game is pretty cool, provides a nice gang management game on top of a pretty good turn-based strategy game.  But after a couple of hours, you've really seen all there is to see, and the rest is just iteration.  It may have some lasting appeal, but there's just not enough of the management game to keep you coming back through different scenarios like there is in other Kalypso games like the Tropico series.  I think it's a good buy, but probably not at $40.  I'd wait for the price to get around $20 before jumping in.			"

												Omerta: City of GangstersPros-#1.Mafia based games are cool#2.Different ways to make money both legally and illegally#3.The graphics are ok#4.The music is okCons-#1.Is there any Italian mafia family that has female and non Italian members?I could believe they might hire one freelance or work with one in their crew but they would never be an actual member.Kind of like Henry Hill from GoodfellasI guess if they do not consider them members just in your crew that is more based on the boss allowing it, they just could never be madeI think they should of made this game so some of the crew you hire they make it clear that the full blooded Italian men can be made and everyone else can not since that was realistic.So it could be a perk to recruit them for that reason.#2.I never saw actual police in the cityYou might find out that deputy so and so lives in this building but they never leave itI have played mafia games similar to this that had a police station or several if the map was big and they would actually walk and drive around the cityIn that game if I was to go and kill someone on the streets the police would go to the location of the murder sometimes not always.You could kill the cops or bribe their boss of their stationIn this game just doing certain actions raises your heat level.I do not have a problem with that in theory but it would be better with police and FBI and DEA in the map and after you do stuff you see them check it outYou could have the option to kill them,bribe them,plant evidence somewhere else ectIn the game I am comparing this to you could blow up the police station and city hall and your rivals buildings#3.The combat sucksThe concept of what they were trying to do with combat could be fun but how it is in this game sucksI would of liked it more with real time point and click combat where we can buy weapons and put them with our crew.They simply would attack who you click on using the weapon they have and we would not control how they use cover if there is any.I know that is really simplistic and some would find that boring but I would of preferred that to thisI disliked the combat in this game so much I just wanted to auto resolve it and let the computer do it for me.It allowed that a few times but later on there was no context it would allow me to do itThis was to me the worst part of the game#4.The lack of an enemy in the main mapJust as there are no police there is no enemy roaming the main mapThey should of allowed us to hire and our enemies to hire lower level henchman/crew bodyguards to guard specific buildings or get in cars and patrol and do drive by shootingsYou know actually attack in real time combat in the main map.Even if it is turn based if you told some crew to drive to set location and you set their aggressive level to max if they see any enemy or police on the way there to just kill and chase them that would be realisticIf you set their level on say defensive they only shoot if shot at but will probably reach the locationIn a real life situation if a mafia boss or police officer wants to kill you or arrest you and they know where you are and you were willing to fight to the death if they tried wouldn't you either# 1. Have bodyguards in front of that building and in it as well if you could afford it#2. Try and hide and go to a new location and take some of those bodyguards with youThis game should have petty gangs which it has but you don't see them on the main map and there should also be large rival mafia families and sometimes multiple ones in the same main mapWe could kill them,bribe them make them so weak they become our ally,plant evidence against them so their boss goes to jail which could slow them down in some waysSteal their cars,booze,weapons ectThey could have missions start where there is one boss who is your friend and you see where he lives vs 2 bigger stronger ones.You could turn on him or you could share with him it is more variety#5.The people walking around the city in the main mapYou can not click on them.You can not kill them.You can not see what they think of any mafia in the city.You can not see why they like you or fear youYou could literally erase them all and it wouldn't change anything#6.Your crew members abilitiesNow they tried in this game and I give them that but they could of added so much more.In the game gangsters 2 and even in the game godfather 2 your crew can have more special perksThey should of tried to improve this more#7.Improving your base/hideoutI could see the reasoning behind paying so much money to allow for better illegal business options.It makes the game more challenging and you can feel like you accomplished something when you finally get the best money making illegal business goingWhat is the point of upgrading the fence?What is the point of getting a pool?Does it improve anything other than how it looks?I don't think it doesNow in theory I have no problem with customizing your base just for looks but why not take it the next step and let us customize how the boss of our family looks like in Tropico?#8.The camera angles in the main mapI would of liked to zoom in much closer and zoom out more#9.The map optionsPlay the game Gangsters 2 and there is a map option where you are like a general seeing the whole battlefield move in real timeIt also makes it easier to see which boss controls what territoryYou would have to see it to really understand but it improves games like theseThe Bottom Line -Omerta: City of Gangsters is a worse version of older mafia games.They should of stolen all the good ideas from the game Gangsters 2 and they should of used the concept of clicking on the everyone to see their point of view like Tropico since this is made by the same peopleIf it is based on combat I would prefer to play the Godfather or Mafia games over this.Gangsters 2 combat was simplistic but it was better than OmertaNow if after reading this if you still want to buy it DO NOT PAY MORE THAN $5 for this gameThat is all it is worth.I paid $10 and I regret it and anyone who paid more than that I feel sorry forMy 2 centsDan			"

												I kinda' wish there was a third option to thumbs up or down. I will go for thumbs up because this isn't a bad game, but I found after a time I was locked into a pattern. The battles do help mix things up. Don't opt out to auto resolve them because then this  game gets extremely dull.My feels are mixed. I think it's a little over priced maybe knock $10 off the price, but I had fun with this and hope they can expand on this. I mostly bought this because the publisher also makes the Tropico games which I adore for their fun and indepth game play and tongue in cheek satire. But this isn't Tropico.Actually check out Tropico 4 when if another Steam sale comes up. I'd recommend that game so much more than this one.			"

												It is a very fun strategy game with a bit of tactical combat.Starts with a straight forward tutorial, however, it explains through the early missions a lot of mechanics behind the game.  In the early game, any tactical battle is incredibly frustrating as your characters quickly face stronger opposition, and better armed opposition. The problem is the tutorial doesn't explain that you can purchase better 'gear' for your gangsters.  It explains everything except that (which is there is special waepon you can purchases from crime lords and deputies).  I missed it because weapons are a sellable commodity in the game as well, so I confused weapons you bought from other chanels from the special weapons that you can equipOnce you get past that hiccup, then the tactical battles are way better. The game flows well, and each scenario is challenging and fun.  There is a lot of reptition but you get engrossed in gang and finance management that the repitition can be overlooked, and I consider it much fun.  Worth getting if you are into the genre. Also the music is quite memoral jazz, and I have left the game running while performing other tasks to have the music play in the background.			"

												Georgia Ave mission is hopelessly broken. Enjoy!EDIT: They fixed this long ago, forgot to add that, changed my review to AWESOME! So much fun if you can look past a few minor mechanical issues. Which again may have been resolved. I haven't played in a while, but with the Japanese Incentive DLC finally on sale for 4.99, I will definitely pick it up again.Believe it or not, this game turned my on to turn-based--tactical and RPGs--gameplay. Before I played Omerta, I hadn't even tried the first two Fallout games, which have now gone down in history as my two favourite games of all time. I know its weird to plug Fallout, but I would have never even considered playing them if it hadn't been for this marvelous gem of a game opening me up to that style of play.Omerta: City of Gangsters--Buy It! Now. Seriously, it's on sale.			"

												Despite the negative reviews it has received, this is a quite solid strategy game.The writing and voice acting certainly leave a lot to be desired, and the game world can be static and formulaic, but there is definitely an interesting strategic challenge. The campaign does a good job of focusing the player through various restrictions and objectives, ensuring that missions offer different experiences and challenges and forcing the player to vary their style.The area in which the game really shines is combat. The player has access to a variety of characters and their performance in combat is quite diverse thanks to the effect of attributes, perks, abilities and weapons. While some of the battles towards the end of the campaign seem almost impossible, it is very satisfying to learn through trial and error and finally get a win against the odds.The sandbox mode exposes some of the flaws of the game, but the campaign mode is long enough to get good value out of the game. There is also DLC if it really captures your imagination.Well worth a go.			"

												Omerta is a great game to buy on sale, and here is why, however till later i will warn you that it becomes kind of broke.In the start it is fun, and new experiance, its a game that requires moves to be done like a game of chess.  In other words you have to constently be thinking of next steps ahead, and it hinders a player from rushing through it.  The game plays good in the begining and missions are fun, story line could be a bit more in depth and their could be a few things changed with hit and line of sight system.  However where this gets a negative is later on the game will on certain missions just freeze due to some game script or it will bug out.  Again its not bad to buy on sale, however i would not recomend paying full price for it.  Overall rating i would give is about a 2/5.  The town managment becomes very boring, as in you set up shops and stuff, alt tab and wait till money is there so you can continue on.  It sorta forces you to play slow without a choice.  Would i recomend this to a friend... As of now, i would say pass and buy another mafia style game out there till this one gets some more tweaks and kinks fixed.			"

												I got this game on sale for about $5... That was definitely worth the entertainment I got out of the game and the ONLY reason I give a thumbs up. If I had paid more than, say... $10? I dunno. The game is pretty repetitive, the stategy aspect is really more about waiting, placing the right things at the right time, and thinking a little bit ahead. The turn-based combat is pretty uninspired, it reminds me of a simpler version of jagged alliance. But what really got me: I spent nearly 2 hours on the last level and towards the end theres a series of dialoge then your main character has to fight a bunch of guys alone, well, my main character has a support weapon (tommy gun) and there is no way for me to change it. It's impossible to win, and I don't feel like going through another two hours of mediocre gameplay, so I'll probably never play this again... The lesson here? Make your own saves.			"

												In the first 20 hours, this game is very loose and boring. but, some battles before ending are good.This game is somewhat similar to tropico4. You repeat your action just as in the previous map.but it is too simple compared to tropico 4 in management. and the city map is so small that you may buy a whole buildings in a map.Battle is too easy at the 'Nornal' Difficulty and too difficult at the 'Hard' Difficulty.Battle is similar to that of XCom and Jagged Alliance. But, this is also simple compared to Jagged Alliance Series.Actually I recommend this game. You can play a game without hard thinking at the normal difficulty. "

												Omerta - City of Gangsters is a criminal tycoon sort of game with mix ups of squad turn based encounters. I reccomend this game if something different once in awhile is what your looking for, however, with lack luster graphics, and good yet repetative period music and overall game play this isn't a game you'll be putting countless hours into. More of a I got an hour to kill once in awhile sort of game as it can burn you out fast if you don't watch. Nothing special, but unique and good for a wasted hour when needed. Overall I give it a 5/10.			"

												The idea of this game is kind of cool.  Unfortunatly the execution is poor.  Basically there isn't any real challenge to this game at all.  There are no rival gangs and you can bribe the police.  Every mission the first thing you do is ignore the main objective and get a speak-easy, a brewery and distillery asap.  Once you start making money, the rest ins't any klnd of challenge.   I wouldn't pay for than $5 for this title unless you just have a thing for gangsters.			"

												Get it on sale.  Omerta is like a 4X (ok, maybe a 3X) for gangsters.  Build your empire, steal some cars, find ways to hamstring your oponents, and occasionally pop into a turn-based tactical game like XCOM, except with mobsters.  Both the empire building and tactical elements of the game are fun, but nothing is perfect.  First, I enjoyed the sandbox mode immensely more than most of the story campaigns.  The campaigns prescribed far to much... ""go take over *that* speakeasy"", ""go hunt for a witness right now"", ""boss fred needs you to x immediately"" ""ok, you finished this scenario eventhough you haven't done all that much, start over on the next map"".  Ugh.  Sandbox on the other hand you can grow where and how you want and you can grow all the way to the end game.  Additionally, to maybe add some additional challenge, some of the end-campaign tactical fights are practically un-winnable.  Your team is limited, but the enemy can spawn a dozen or so high-powered units around and behind you as you are on your way ""out"".  Cheap.			"

												Omerta is good mix of turn based combat and RTS.You build your crew out of the characters that you have unlocked in the missions. After you get the hang of how the system works you will have enough resources to buy everything you want in no time. The combat system feels somewhat simplistic and you will soon have a crew that can beat everything with ease if you build it right. Every weapon and building has its own strengths and variating between them will make your crew better. One of the main drawbacks to the game is the preset locations for businesses and the fact that more=better in Omerta.A decent game but i wouldn't pay full price for it. 5.5/10			"

												This is an alright game to waste a few hours with if you enjoy turn based combat and gangsters. The turn based combat is fun enough and worth spending a couple of hours with. Different skills and weapons adds some variety to the combat but the lack of variety when it comes to levels and  mission design combined wtih the fact that the combat is not that fun made me lose interest in it after a while.The city view with its gang management could have kept my interest but this part of the game just isn't good enough to keep my attention for a long time. The city is nice to look at and the management is certainly functional but it is just so simplisitc and easy that it is not really worth talking about. It simply turns into a waiting game and the constant reseting of resources between missions made me lose all interest in anything else than getting to the next mission. The management certainly adds something positive to the game but it gets repetitive in the campaign and it didn't succed in keeping me interested for the long time you are expected to spend doing it.The story has its charm even though it is quite basic and i would say the same about the voice acting, portraits,characters and dialogue . Nothing stands out but it does its job and they have some charm to them. I found none of these thing good enough to keep me interested in the game however.Overall i found the game to have a pacing problem and during the 9-ish hours that i spent in the game they threw a whole lot of similar stuff at me. This might be a good thing for those who want a long campaign for their money but i would have prefered a shorter campaign with less filler. Perhaps i will give it another hours or so but i believe that i am done with this game. This means that the game failed to be interesting enough for me to complete the campaign but it was interesting enough to make me spend around 10 hours with it.			"

												This game gets a lot of comparisons with XCom because of the combat system, but I think those comparisons also give a very misinformed idea of what the game is to prospective players and it ends up with crushed expectations.The combat system is very similar, but here the main focus is on running the gang and it's operations, jobs, and so on as opposed to focusing mainly on combat. That makes it a lot slower paced, but not in a bad or good way - just in a ""this isn't XCOM"" way, which might not be what you're looking for.For me, it's just right and I actually really enjoy playing. The combat is strategic (albeit starter guns feel almost based on random chance to hit sometimes) especially after you start buying better weapons and getting new henchmen - and the town gameplay takes a good amount of planning to get down right and is addictive somehow. The actual combat is actually challenging on a good level at times too - while in XCOM you either get through super easy or it's just TOO difficult.I recommend it if you don't mind a slower paced strategy game and like the mob - otherwise, just get XCOM if you want a lot of action and not much else or are more into sci-fi than mafia stuff. Both are great games, but they are for different audiences.			"

												Its a pretty good game, I enjoy the economics and management aspects of it, but my only problem with it is some of the tactical encounters are near impossible, even in the tutorial. The second tactical scenario in the game (when they first raid your hideout) my boss was wielding a shotgun, which not even once was pointed at the enemy no matter where or who I clicked on. Ended up having to start a new game, where I tried to raid a brewery, and ended up facing 10 kamikaze KKK fanatics throwing knives and bombs at my two guys, who promptly rolled over and died on the very first attack. Kind of annoying when you are just getting to know the game and it keeps throwing these ridiculous scenarios at you, forcing you to face down 5 or 10 to one odds with either a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pistol, revolver, or a shotgun that the main character only shoots in the opposite direction of the enemy. I recommend, but only at your own risk as I hear support is garbage too.			"

												When I first that this game was being made, I was extremely excited because I am a huge fan of the 1920-1950s mafia and I love both Mafia 2 and Godfather the video game so much. It was also a big bonus that this would be a strategy game that I would extremely want to get the game as soon as it comes out.BOY was I extremely wrong. Not only was this game a complete underwelming strategy game but it also doesn't feel liek a true mafia game. For one thing, you can only recruit precreated characters and never recruit random people. Also people seem to behave like as heroes, meaning that if you lose anyone, they get wounded for number of days instead of being axed off during your playthrough. Combat is actually underwelming and the game is overall bland. I do not recommend this game			"

It is cool to expand your business in 1920's America but this game is not perfect and quite redundantThe real-time gestion part is interesting at the beginning and the money balance is very good, then it becomes a bit redundant when you understood how it works. Like in XCOM, the turn-based tactic combats could be VERY VERY VERY VERY frustrating on some difficulty peaks.

												The easiest way I'd describe this game is ""strategy lite."" There's an X-Com-like fight system, which can be a little unfair at times: every combat encounter brings the sometimes unwelcome surprise of a more powerful and more numerous enemy. It feels to me like Kalypso tried to nail the appeal of an X-Com combat system but fell woefully short. The larger world is straight-forward and reminded me of the gangster-business end of Godfather 2 (PS2), but is largely just a means to the story end - there's no real challenge to it. The story is good, and presented in a style which many Kalypso fans will recognize.I would recommend this game to anybody looking for a break from the more challenging strategy games that we all enjoy dumping so many hundreds of hours into. I would not recommend it to anybody who is looking for a well-wrought combat system or challenging strategic game.			"

And it's a damn shame because it is a fun game in my honest opinion.I love a good sandbox title, and this game gives you some challenge for sure. It's intuitive, and I didn't even need to play the tutorial again after so long, you can pick it up- get your honest businessmen rolling and shooting up business (Both meanings, if you catch my drift.).

												Easily the most broken turn-based combat I have ever played. I know there is an achievement for missing a shot with 95% chance to hit, but it shouldn't happen every single fight, multiple times. Enemies across the map will get three hits in a row with 30% accuracy and you will miss all shots with 80. Cover is completely pointless anyway because enemies will just sprint up to you and never get on cover themselves. I honestly tried to like this game and had a good amount of fun with taking over the city, and I may have recommended it if it didn't force you to do combat. Final note, whoever thought it was a good idea to leave out an ""exit battle"" button on the autosaved pre-fight screen should be labotomized. You either have to play through an impossibly one-sided fight or quit and restart everything over. I paid 6 dollars and I regret it.			"

												Omerta seems like it could have been a fun game. The problem is it waivers between too slow while you wait for the resources you need and constantly keep re-bribing cops and starting over. The game would probably have been much more fun if, like The Godfather (the first game), you built up your criminal empire over time. Instead, you build up your current city of nowhere, do the few ""story"" missions which will give you some combat, reach some sort of resource goals, and start over.Without the pleasure of really developing, the city/empire building feels completely hollow.The combat is better, but it is still a significant step down from something like XCOM. At least if ou were doing it more, it would feel more important. The cover system seems rather flakey about always helping you rather than making you just crouch at a strange point. Combat also feels to draw out especially if a single baddie is hiding in some corner somewhere and you have to track it down.I admit to not making it to the part of the game where you can actually build structures and the like, but it was just so boring that I didn't care to continue. And why would you play a game that's boring anyway? There are better games for anything you would be looking for here.			"

												I honestly can't recommend this game.  It starts out with character history/stats customisation, which is quite fun but seems to ultimately have a negligible effect during the actual game.  The management gameplay mechanics are incredibly simple and I felt that within a few hours of play I was simply repeating the same set of actions over and over for each mission (at the end of which you go back to zero and move onto the next mission).  The combat mechanics are more interesting, but seem somewhat broken, with a particularly erratic AI at times.All that aside, the game is essentially boring and I felt I had got all I was going to out of the game after a few of hours of play. Definitely not worth the £30 price tag (I got it on sale thankfully).			"

												This game had me for about three hours.The rest of the time I spent in a sort of trance, wherein I wasn't really enjoying myself but I couldn't quite put it down, hoping I'd find some spark that would reignite my enjoyment of this title.The strong point of this game is the period setting of 'Atlantic' City, replete with boardwalks, hooch smugglers, strongarm mobsters and bad accents.  A small crew (starting with 3, capping out at 6) operates around a particular segment of the city, working their way into local businesses, strangling the cash flow and occasionally shooting up other mobsters.The city management element of the game is a fairly simple juggle of three resources (beer, liquor, firearms), two types of money (dirty and clean) and police attention (gained by doing more of the things that get you the aforementioned items).  While I enjoyed seeing the city turn through its day-night cycle, the interaction was shallow and repetitive.  The best means of expansion across the urban setting is to reveal all local businesses via informants (who can be asked, forced or paid to do so), set up a supply chain of materials (a brewery to make beer, for instance, and a bar to consume it) and wait for the money to trickle in.And wait.And wait some more...In the interim, you can harass local businesses for immediate rewards, but these come with diminished income options and lots of police attention - which is the one way to attain a Game Loss state.  If the police meter tops out, the investigators come a-knockin'.  They can be paid off (the fee doubles each time), you can throw another business under the bus (worsening relations with all goods providers), call in a favor from a bribed official (if one was buttered-up prior) or you can engage in a single combat encounter to try and destroy the evidence.  Fail to provide one of these, and the game ends.But the waiting gets silly.  There is a fine point where your income and expenses are evenly matched and you're racing the margin curve to watch your influence spread across the town... But once you have it all, there's nothing to do with it.  Just watch the money numbers go higher as your Hotels and Casinos roll in totally legit *cough* moneys into your grubby coffers.But wait! The game features a turn-based combat mechanic with your squadmates! (whom you pay to retain every morning in-game).  There is a decent amount of attention to the environments, and your fragile mobsters will have to make good use of cover to avoid gut-shredding volleys of lead from your opposition.The interface is a mixed bag; on one hand, if you set a travel path for your character to take, the game helpfully counts out the steps (in Movement Points), tells you when an intersecting line of sight for an opponent comes up and displays available abilities cleanly; But then the camera obscures critical cover or registers a movement point for a character on the WRONG FLOOR and sends a goon running out into the open, making for a flight of stairs he won't reach for three turns!The gunplay is vicious, as enemies and allies both have shallow HP pools and guns do what guns do best.  There are also knives, brass knuckles and baseball bats, but it takes a truly hardy character to withstand being shot to death by four opponents before their next turn.It's disappointing that a game with good intentions for its environments does so little to help you customize or get to know your team.  There is a levelling mechanic (but in the campaign the level-ups are event-locked to missions, not combat encounters) wherein every level allows for a team member to grab a new perk.  These range from increasing core stats to raising critical chances and giving new abilities.  Of course, seeing as your henchmen never get stronger on their own, a single combat mistake can send your veteran to jail or the morgue.  Oh, there are also persistent injuries, wherein your character might lose half of their stamina bar or move at 1/3 normal rate.  No punches pulled here, folks.While you can purchase new weapons in the game and assign one to any given character, there is no cosmetic change on the models and the weapons lack flavor within their subclass; By this I mean that while I greatly appreciate 'the revolver' actually being two separate pistols, able to retalliate at the first shot fired and spray lead in a cone as a special attack (a great touch of flavor!), any one revolver behaves like any other, be it a common or a unique weapon.And as many reviews have pointed out, the game simply gets boring.  There is little incentive to advance within the story, except to discover how the various buildings you can set up in the city can synergize - or how snipey a Sniper can become, given enough accuracy and critical perks.But this game simply fails to inspire.  It looks nice, but it's far more shallow than one would hope.While it's worth a look at a discount or a bundle, I only managed to enjoy about 5 hours of its mechanics (not counting the plodding tutorial) and the rest was spent holding my breath for more.  Eventually my lungs collapsed and I died.  But then I got better and regretted the time spent not breathing.			"

												The game is long and the missions are repetitive. It's fun to buy assets, manage your financial sources, and build your dirty money empire, but you basically have to start over each time you play in a new district and it gets boring after a few hours of gameplay. Storyline is poor, turn-based combat is fine. It is maybe worth it when it is in  the 3$-6$ price range, I definitely not recommend it if its more expensive than that.			"

												I got Omerta free with Tropico 5 pre-order. It is an other type of game but we can retrieve the Tropico touch: good soundtrack, great ambiance, funny characters, nice graphics, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ UIs and script bugs. It is cool to expand your business in 1920's America but this game is not perfect and quite redundantThe real-time gestion part is interesting at the beginning and the money balance is very good, then it becomes a bit redundant when you understood how it works. Like in XCOM, the turn-based tactic combats could be VERY VERY VERY VERY frustrating on some difficulty peaks. It becomes better after having learned a few tricks, unlocked some characters, new weapons and character abilities...			"

												Omerta- City of Gangsters is one of those games where, you're not entirely sure whether it's going to be good or not from the outset.I know that when I first got it, I picked it up, liked it, and then didn't pick it up again because other games seem to outshine it a little. And it's a damn shame because it is a fun game in my honest opinion.I love a good sandbox title, and this game gives you some challenge for sure. It's intuitive, and I didn't even need to play the tutorial again after so long, you can pick it up- get your honest businessmen rolling and shooting up business (Both meanings, if you catch my drift.).

												Two reasons why I don't recommend this game (boy was i looking forward to this title, big disappointment coming from a gangsters 2 fan)1) Kalypso account needed to play, even for offline use.  I can not put into words how bad of a taste this leaves in my mouth.  Spend money on a game with the expectation to play it, load the game, and you're presented with a screen that does not let you go past it until you give them you email.  Even for offline play.  What a slap in the face to the customers, AFTER recieving their money.2) SHORT, SMALL MAPS!.  The mapsize is TINY and once you expand into the couple of other neighborhoods (yes its that small), the game is over.  now what do you do, start over? just so you can rule the few blocks that is the entirety of the map?  Stupid.  (Disclaimer: as of august 2014, I have ALL of the DLC.  maps are still tiny)In conclusion, if someone from kalypso ever reads this, you guys seriously need to stop this♥♥♥♥♥♥with the kalypso launcher account.  I already paid for the game, have it bound to my steam account.  The last thing I want to do is screw around with some stupid account with a publisher.  (Just remember how bad the response was for the new simcity requiring you to be online, this is just as bad)  Quit that♥♥♥♥♥♥  I'm not buying another one of your games unless I see a review that says there is no stupid kalypso launcher.  Way to♥♥♥♥♥♥all over the gaming industry.			"

												Not bad game, if you like other games from Kalypso, like Tropico or Port Royale, you will probably want to play this game. You are not building your city, you are modifying existing city, running your gang members, your business. Fighting system is ... , interesting for a while. This is one of the few games which should be shorter, because you are doing the same stuff, little changes, but it is boring at the end. I for example did not finished this game, story is not interesting, must be part, like Call of duty, Watchdogs, nothing special, nothing interesting. I recommend this game, but only for small price, I got it for free with Torpico 5 prepurchase. Pros:  Different game Gangsters Cons:  Too long Story "

												Omerta: City of GangstersPros-#1.Mafia based games are cool#2.Different ways to make money both legally and illegally#3.The graphics are ok#4.The music is okCons-#1.Is there any Italian mafia family that has female and non Italian members?I could believe they might hire one freelance or work with one in their crew but they would never be an actual member.Kind of like Henry Hill from GoodfellasI guess if they do not consider them members just in your crew that is more based on the boss allowing it, they just could never be madeI think they should of made this game so some of the crew you hire they make it clear that the full blooded Italian men can be made and everyone else can not since that was realistic.So it could be a perk to recruit them for that reason.#2.I never saw actual police in the cityYou might find out that deputy so and so lives in this building but they never leave itI have played mafia games similar to this that had a police station or several if the map was big and they would actually walk and drive around the cityIn that game if I was to go and kill someone on the streets the police would go to the location of the murder sometimes not always.You could kill the cops or bribe their boss of their stationIn this game just doing certain actions raises your heat level.I do not have a problem with that in theory but it would be better with police and FBI and DEA in the map and after you do stuff you see them check it outYou could have the option to kill them,bribe them,plant evidence somewhere else ectIn the game I am comparing this to you could blow up the police station and city hall and your rivals buildings#3.The combat sucksThe concept of what they were trying to do with combat could be fun but how it is in this game sucksI would of liked it more with real time point and click combat where we can buy weapons and put them with our crew.They simply would attack who you click on using the weapon they have and we would not control how they use cover if there is any.I know that is really simplistic and some would find that boring but I would of preferred that to thisI disliked the combat in this game so much I just wanted to auto resolve it and let the computer do it for me.It allowed that a few times but later on there was no context it would allow me to do itThis was to me the worst part of the game#4.The lack of an enemy in the main mapJust as there are no police there is no enemy roaming the main mapThey should of allowed us to hire and our enemies to hire lower level henchman/crew bodyguards to guard specific buildings or get in cars and patrol and do drive by shootingsYou know actually attack in real time combat in the main map.Even if it is turn based if you told some crew to drive to set location and you set their aggressive level to max if they see any enemy or police on the way there to just kill and chase them that would be realisticIf you set their level on say defensive they only shoot if shot at but will probably reach the locationIn a real life situation if a mafia boss or police officer wants to kill you or arrest you and they know where you are and you were willing to fight to the death if they tried wouldn't you either# 1. Have bodyguards in front of that building and in it as well if you could afford it#2. Try and hide and go to a new location and take some of those bodyguards with youThis game should have petty gangs which it has but you don't see them on the main map and there should also be large rival mafia families and sometimes multiple ones in the same main mapWe could kill them,bribe them make them so weak they become our ally,plant evidence against them so their boss goes to jail which could slow them down in some waysSteal their cars,booze,weapons ectThey could have missions start where there is one boss who is your friend and you see where he lives vs 2 bigger stronger ones.You could turn on him or you could share with him it is more variety#5.The people walking around the city in the main mapYou can not click on them.You can not kill them.You can not see what they think of any mafia in the city.You can not see why they like you or fear youYou could literally erase them all and it wouldn't change anything#6.Your crew members abilitiesNow they tried in this game and I give them that but they could of added so much more.In the game gangsters 2 and even in the game godfather 2 your crew can have more special perksThey should of tried to improve this more#7.Improving your base/hideoutI could see the reasoning behind paying so much money to allow for better illegal business options.It makes the game more challenging and you can feel like you accomplished something when you finally get the best money making illegal business goingWhat is the point of upgrading the fence?What is the point of getting a pool?Does it improve anything other than how it looks?I don't think it doesNow in theory I have no problem with customizing your base just for looks but why not take it the next step and let us customize how the boss of our family looks like in Tropico?#8.The camera angles in the main mapI would of liked to zoom in much closer and zoom out more#9.The map optionsPlay the game Gangsters 2 and there is a map option where you are like a general seeing the whole battlefield move in real timeIt also makes it easier to see which boss controls what territoryYou would have to see it to really understand but it improves games like theseThe Bottom Line -Omerta: City of Gangsters is a worse version of older mafia games.They should of stolen all the good ideas from the game Gangsters 2 and they should of used the concept of clicking on the everyone to see their point of view like Tropico since this is made by the same peopleIf it is based on combat I would prefer to play the Godfather or Mafia games over this.Gangsters 2 combat was simplistic but it was better than OmertaNow if after reading this if you still want to buy it DO NOT PAY MORE THAN $5 for this gameThat is all it is worth.I paid $10 and I regret it and anyone who paid more than that I feel sorry forMy 2 centsDan			"

												When I first that this game was being made, I was extremely excited because I am a huge fan of the 1920-1950s mafia and I love both Mafia 2 and Godfather the video game so much. It was also a big bonus that this would be a strategy game that I would extremely want to get the game as soon as it comes out.BOY was I extremely wrong. Not only was this game a complete underwelming strategy game but it also doesn't feel liek a true mafia game. For one thing, you can only recruit precreated characters and never recruit random people. Also people seem to behave like as heroes, meaning that if you lose anyone, they get wounded for number of days instead of being axed off during your playthrough. Combat is actually underwelming and the game is overall bland. I do not recommend this game			"

It's fairly well executed on the core concepts, though it lacks some polish that keeps it from being absolutely great (such as UI, some translation issues, and some rough edges in the gameplay that might just be tough to solve -- such as ending a mission prematurely or not knowing when it ends, and needing to know you should buy all the guns before moving on to a new mission).

												Omerta is a pretty average game but not without having its moments. The strategy and management parts are pretty shallow but easy to understand. Kalypso manages to still include their signature charm and quirks into what can be said as a pretty average game. As a gangster themed game, it delivers quite a bit into the setting. Gameplay-wise don't expect anything groundbreaking but the fun it will bring would keep one playing for a while. Combat is its storngest aspect and can keep the player on their toes during these engagements. In conclusion, its fun but it can get pretty dull and repetitive at times. 7/10.			"

												Its sort of like Gangsters (1998) but much more dumbed down. Not to say thats a bad thing.The main difference being there is a turn-based tactical battle system in it. My first playthrough of the game i didn't care much for the game, as I got my butt kicked even on Normal difficulty. But I went back and played it on a better difficulty for me and really enjoyed it. I played it non-stop until I beat the map I was playing. Ok. So what is the game?You start off with one character, yours. and then Hire more henchmen as you gain Dirty and Clean money. You'll build Speakseasy's and smuggle beer and liqour in to supply them to turn a profit. You'll have to take over NPC businesses by raiding them or having your businesses put them outta business.   Also taking over rival gangs buildings. All while amassing wealth, guns, and more supplies. All this happening while the Police catch on to you over time with the Heat system. But luckily you can hire Hitment class Henchmen to perform actions without gaining heat. And you can also bribe the Sheriff and Politicians to lower Heat and bust your henchmen outta jail. Build special buildings that turn your Dirty money into Clean money. Lower heat. Other special buildings that automatically send Hitsquads out to attack your enemies. There is a TON of synergy with how you can build. And thats not just because a Distillery supplies a Nightclub. Many buildings often have their own bonuses. Bookkeepers will give a bonus to Boxing arenas because of the implied betting and fixed fights (there's no option for this. its just an explanation of the idea of the bonus). Or you can build a Lawyers office that gives a bonus to the Accountant building that helps you're money laundering. Etc.Battle system? Well your henchmens class is kind of determined on what weapons they are using. Shotguns shoot in a wide cone, as do Tommy Guns. But Tommy Guns often cause you're enemies to Panic because of the Courage system in the game. Too much damage to your HP and/or Courage and you're henchmen will lose Action Points (for how many times you can shoot or use an ability per turn) and Movement Points (Obviously, affects how you can move in battle).  Other weapons like Knives, Baseball Bats, Katana's (Yes Katana's..), Machine Guns (Different than Tommy Guns), Flame Throwers, Sniper Rifles, Semi-Automatic Pistols, Dual Revolvers... And probably more..  Each with their own affects in battle, and own abilities.  Giving a WIDE range of tactical freedom. Combat is fun. To put it short. Even funner is visiting local Crime Lords to buy special weapons of what I mentioned above. Giving weapons anywhere from 10-30% extra damage. Reducing AP cost of actions by 1 point per action. Increasing Critical Strike Chance. Making the cone of damage or range of your weapons greater.. Just so much.And even more after the battle is leveling your Henchmen up to a max level of 12. Picking perks each time they level. Increasing their stats, their Critical Chance/Damage. Really the weakest part of this game is that I wish it gave more freedom over buildings. And I wish those buildings had more functions. I wish there was bolder features to some buildings. I also wish they would have done more detailed features like Gangsters did where you could Kidnap and Assassinate certain gang members. The game really just needs more Cloak and Dagger to it. But it's still a great game. Pick it up on sale. Play a few games. Take over the city. Its a very underrated game, in my book. Wish we could get more Mobster/Mafia sims. This one does a solid job to the genre.			"

I've played it post patches and what not, but the amount of waiting and waiting and waiting you spend on your guys doing actions is ridiculous.  I don't expect to have everything happen instantly, by any means.  I love Civilization, and the waiting that game entails.  But it's a different sort of entertaining wait that you can actually utilize to tweak a few things here and there.  Not so in Omerta.

												Omerta- groundhog day.I highly recomend against buying this game. Much of the mechanics in game are terrible. One would have thought that a turnbased combat game would have taken some inspiration from XCOM. The turnbased/fighting mechanics are terrible. Often times, things that ought to be able to be used as covers instead limits ones ability to shoot. And cover in itself seems to do nothing.The game feels very limited due to restarting on a new map all the time. So it lacks alot of progression (altough it does have a sandbox mode).Almost no character progression( characters gain 1 lvl as a reward for completing some maps).			"

												This game gets a lot of comparisons with XCom because of the combat system, but I think those comparisons also give a very misinformed idea of what the game is to prospective players and it ends up with crushed expectations.The combat system is very similar, but here the main focus is on running the gang and it's operations, jobs, and so on as opposed to focusing mainly on combat. That makes it a lot slower paced, but not in a bad or good way - just in a ""this isn't XCOM"" way, which might not be what you're looking for.For me, it's just right and I actually really enjoy playing. The combat is strategic (albeit starter guns feel almost based on random chance to hit sometimes) especially after you start buying better weapons and getting new henchmen - and the town gameplay takes a good amount of planning to get down right and is addictive somehow. The actual combat is actually challenging on a good level at times too - while in XCOM you either get through super easy or it's just TOO difficult.I recommend it if you don't mind a slower paced strategy game and like the mob - otherwise, just get XCOM if you want a lot of action and not much else or are more into sci-fi than mafia stuff. Both are great games, but they are for different audiences.			"

												Omerta seems like it could have been a fun game. The problem is it waivers between too slow while you wait for the resources you need and constantly keep re-bribing cops and starting over. The game would probably have been much more fun if, like The Godfather (the first game), you built up your criminal empire over time. Instead, you build up your current city of nowhere, do the few ""story"" missions which will give you some combat, reach some sort of resource goals, and start over.Without the pleasure of really developing, the city/empire building feels completely hollow.The combat is better, but it is still a significant step down from something like XCOM. At least if ou were doing it more, it would feel more important. The cover system seems rather flakey about always helping you rather than making you just crouch at a strange point. Combat also feels to draw out especially if a single baddie is hiding in some corner somewhere and you have to track it down.I admit to not making it to the part of the game where you can actually build structures and the like, but it was just so boring that I didn't care to continue. And why would you play a game that's boring anyway? There are better games for anything you would be looking for here.			"

												While the game doesn't do anything remarkable, it's a fun enough game and is easy to learn.  You won't lose days of your life in it, but if you are new to isometric turn-based combat, it's an easy entry point.  The main story will be over between 8-15 hours or so, depending how much you struggle.  Any experienced player will be lucky to see more than 10 hours storyline on normal difficulty.If it's on sale, worth it.  If not, then... not			"

												Its sort of like Gangsters (1998) but much more dumbed down. Not to say thats a bad thing.The main difference being there is a turn-based tactical battle system in it. My first playthrough of the game i didn't care much for the game, as I got my butt kicked even on Normal difficulty. But I went back and played it on a better difficulty for me and really enjoyed it. I played it non-stop until I beat the map I was playing. Ok. So what is the game?You start off with one character, yours. and then Hire more henchmen as you gain Dirty and Clean money. You'll build Speakseasy's and smuggle beer and liqour in to supply them to turn a profit. You'll have to take over NPC businesses by raiding them or having your businesses put them outta business.   Also taking over rival gangs buildings. All while amassing wealth, guns, and more supplies. All this happening while the Police catch on to you over time with the Heat system. But luckily you can hire Hitment class Henchmen to perform actions without gaining heat. And you can also bribe the Sheriff and Politicians to lower Heat and bust your henchmen outta jail. Build special buildings that turn your Dirty money into Clean money. Lower heat. Other special buildings that automatically send Hitsquads out to attack your enemies. There is a TON of synergy with how you can build. And thats not just because a Distillery supplies a Nightclub. Many buildings often have their own bonuses. Bookkeepers will give a bonus to Boxing arenas because of the implied betting and fixed fights (there's no option for this. its just an explanation of the idea of the bonus). Or you can build a Lawyers office that gives a bonus to the Accountant building that helps you're money laundering. Etc.Battle system? Well your henchmens class is kind of determined on what weapons they are using. Shotguns shoot in a wide cone, as do Tommy Guns. But Tommy Guns often cause you're enemies to Panic because of the Courage system in the game. Too much damage to your HP and/or Courage and you're henchmen will lose Action Points (for how many times you can shoot or use an ability per turn) and Movement Points (Obviously, affects how you can move in battle).  Other weapons like Knives, Baseball Bats, Katana's (Yes Katana's..), Machine Guns (Different than Tommy Guns), Flame Throwers, Sniper Rifles, Semi-Automatic Pistols, Dual Revolvers... And probably more..  Each with their own affects in battle, and own abilities.  Giving a WIDE range of tactical freedom. Combat is fun. To put it short. Even funner is visiting local Crime Lords to buy special weapons of what I mentioned above. Giving weapons anywhere from 10-30% extra damage. Reducing AP cost of actions by 1 point per action. Increasing Critical Strike Chance. Making the cone of damage or range of your weapons greater.. Just so much.And even more after the battle is leveling your Henchmen up to a max level of 12. Picking perks each time they level. Increasing their stats, their Critical Chance/Damage. Really the weakest part of this game is that I wish it gave more freedom over buildings. And I wish those buildings had more functions. I wish there was bolder features to some buildings. I also wish they would have done more detailed features like Gangsters did where you could Kidnap and Assassinate certain gang members. The game really just needs more Cloak and Dagger to it. But it's still a great game. Pick it up on sale. Play a few games. Take over the city. Its a very underrated game, in my book. Wish we could get more Mobster/Mafia sims. This one does a solid job to the genre.			"

The problem is all the carry over between senarios and all the chracter development is focused on combat.  The combat is important, but far more time is spent on developing your organization.  It would make the game more fun and more challenging if there were skills and equipment for both combat and non-combat, and you had to choose between them.			"

												Despite the negative reviews it has received, this is a quite solid strategy game.The writing and voice acting certainly leave a lot to be desired, and the game world can be static and formulaic, but there is definitely an interesting strategic challenge. The campaign does a good job of focusing the player through various restrictions and objectives, ensuring that missions offer different experiences and challenges and forcing the player to vary their style.The area in which the game really shines is combat. The player has access to a variety of characters and their performance in combat is quite diverse thanks to the effect of attributes, perks, abilities and weapons. While some of the battles towards the end of the campaign seem almost impossible, it is very satisfying to learn through trial and error and finally get a win against the odds.The sandbox mode exposes some of the flaws of the game, but the campaign mode is long enough to get good value out of the game. There is also DLC if it really captures your imagination.Well worth a go.			"

So much fun if you can look past a few minor mechanical issues. Which again may have been resolved. I haven't played in a while, but with the Japanese Incentive DLC finally on sale for 4.99, I will definitely pick it up again.Believe it or not, this game turned my on to turn-based--tactical and RPGs--gameplay. Before I played Omerta, I hadn't even tried the first two Fallout games, which have now gone down in history as my two favourite games of all time. I know its weird to plug Fallout, but I would have never even considered playing them if it hadn't been for this marvelous gem of a game opening me up to that style of play.Omerta: City of Gangsters--Buy It!

												Its a pretty good game, I enjoy the economics and management aspects of it, but my only problem with it is some of the tactical encounters are near impossible, even in the tutorial. The second tactical scenario in the game (when they first raid your hideout) my boss was wielding a shotgun, which not even once was pointed at the enemy no matter where or who I clicked on. Ended up having to start a new game, where I tried to raid a brewery, and ended up facing 10 kamikaze KKK fanatics throwing knives and bombs at my two guys, who promptly rolled over and died on the very first attack. Kind of annoying when you are just getting to know the game and it keeps throwing these ridiculous scenarios at you, forcing you to face down 5 or 10 to one odds with either a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pistol, revolver, or a shotgun that the main character only shoots in the opposite direction of the enemy. I recommend, but only at your own risk as I hear support is garbage too.			"

												When I first that this game was being made, I was extremely excited because I am a huge fan of the 1920-1950s mafia and I love both Mafia 2 and Godfather the video game so much. It was also a big bonus that this would be a strategy game that I would extremely want to get the game as soon as it comes out.BOY was I extremely wrong. Not only was this game a complete underwelming strategy game but it also doesn't feel liek a true mafia game. For one thing, you can only recruit precreated characters and never recruit random people. Also people seem to behave like as heroes, meaning that if you lose anyone, they get wounded for number of days instead of being axed off during your playthrough. Combat is actually underwelming and the game is overall bland. I do not recommend this game			"

												Omerta is good mix of turn based combat and RTS.You build your crew out of the characters that you have unlocked in the missions. After you get the hang of how the system works you will have enough resources to buy everything you want in no time. The combat system feels somewhat simplistic and you will soon have a crew that can beat everything with ease if you build it right. Every weapon and building has its own strengths and variating between them will make your crew better. One of the main drawbacks to the game is the preset locations for businesses and the fact that more=better in Omerta.A decent game but i wouldn't pay full price for it. 5.5/10			"

												Omerta is a great game to buy on sale, and here is why, however till later i will warn you that it becomes kind of broke.In the start it is fun, and new experiance, its a game that requires moves to be done like a game of chess.  In other words you have to constently be thinking of next steps ahead, and it hinders a player from rushing through it.  The game plays good in the begining and missions are fun, story line could be a bit more in depth and their could be a few things changed with hit and line of sight system.  However where this gets a negative is later on the game will on certain missions just freeze due to some game script or it will bug out.  Again its not bad to buy on sale, however i would not recomend paying full price for it.  Overall rating i would give is about a 2/5.  The town managment becomes very boring, as in you set up shops and stuff, alt tab and wait till money is there so you can continue on.  It sorta forces you to play slow without a choice.  Would i recomend this to a friend... As of now, i would say pass and buy another mafia style game out there till this one gets some more tweaks and kinks fixed.			"

The resource management system is flawed by having movement points and action points, its not interesting or unique in any way and your guys can take 5 or less steps and have to take a shot at 23% *miss* there is also no way to increase your characters stats so you just gotta grind the slow boring fights that youll most likely injure at least 1 toon. There is also no way to customize your characters. I just can't remember the last time i played a game so passively. Oh and the other ""gangs"" A.I. never attack or retaliate in any way.

I kept playing because I WANTED to like this game I WANTED to play until I liked it. I wanted it to be worth my time. I wanted too much...Pros:This is an easy strategy game.Great for casual players... Kind of...The turn based combat is simple...Cons:AI is abysmal.Balance is nonexistent.Economic side is dumbed down to facebook level.Equipment is impossible to get what you want.Let’s just say the cons are the game seems like the alpha of the game was released where they were just trying to figure out what they were trying to do... Then never came back and finished the game and released the first almost playable concept...Let’s start with character development. There is an attempt at it. It is not based on combat, kills, damage, jobs/missions, or anything that should cause your character to increase. The only thing that triggers level advancement or character progress is certain pre-scripted missions that grant you a level. This dumbs down progression and makes it anti-climactic and tedious. No matter if I play a level completely through conquer all the properties and finish every detail, or do the bare minimum it does not change the character development. This is obnoxious.Equipment is like an afterthought in this game. You have 1 slot for 1 weapon. That is it. 1 slot. You can equip a single weapon. No body armor, med kits, or any of a countless other standard fare in these games. No switching between primary and secondary weapons. You get ONE weapon. And most of what you are offered is baseball bats and knives to fight people with tommy guns and flame throwers. For every three melee weapons I was offered a ranged weapon. And most levels (streets) allow you to buy 0-3 weapons. There are no equipment drops during combat. You find yourself quickly using pistols and revolvers and melee weapons against much more powerful items. Seriously, the balance on weapons is non-existent, but helps balance the poor AI.The AI is horrific. Some missions you swear they are scripted and others if they can't see you or your target, they don't get to move. I have had combat where I have two enemies with a divider wall between them in a U shaped room. As I moved I spotted both but I am obscured from the one and he is not in my direct line of sight. They are less than 10 move from each other. I shoot the exploding barrel next to my target as it was both his cover and a way to do more damage. The fire crosses the divider immediately and will soon start the hidden character on fire. He doesn’t spot me yet. What? I shot the barrel in front of him and he is on fire and does not get to act??? I shoot and miss, still oblivious. I shoot and hit with my final shot and miraculously he spots me. End turn. He runs further INTO the fire and shoots at me from there with a flame thrower… Ok, ironic and a bit funny… I am now on fire, he is on fire the fire he is standing in is spreading. The guy on the other side of the divider doesn’t come out. My turn, I move back to cover and shoot at him until I am out of actions. His turn he stays where he is and tries to flame me again. Still waiting, the other guy does not get an action. I take him out finally. One of my other character gets in position and the other guy was just standing in the flames like nothing was wrong. Awesome AI!!!!Your economic side is deciding which prefab buildings to rent or attack and rent or buy out… And set up enterprises to make money. You can’t build more. You can’t upgrade sites. You get a category per site with set selections and then you can “improve” the selected business. Or you can buy residential and a small house, apartment, or factory all cost $1000 and make you $80. No balance, logic, reason, or anything. You have limited choices and it plays like a phone app or facebook game.Heat is how much the police have noticed your criminal activity. And it doesn’t matter if you are running legitimate businesses only or criminal ones you are going to gain heat just for existing. I have tried even going as far as not owning anything, not running a single mission, and just sitting there. And yes, even if you do NOTHING and own NOTHING the heat level increases. It appears to have a minimum increase over time with modifiers depending on mission.I so wanted to like this game. But alas Jagged Alliance I was better and Jagged Alliance II blew the doors off of this game. Kalypso, please finish this game… or at least advance it to BETA from the playable concept you released… "

												This is almost a good game.  I was extremely dissapointed by the sandbox mode, because you cannot expand into other neighbourhoods in the city.  After 15 minutes, you have dominated the map and there is no point ot continue playing beyond this point.  The one player is fun but after playing it through once, you're done with the game.			"

												Fun and addictive, this game had me immersed in the prohibition era slang and blossoming organized crime syndicates.

												I wanted this game to be good because I love the genre.  Here are some of my issues:- the campain map didn't have enough depth, there needed to be more to do and more reasons to do them- there wasn't enough RPG elements with the characters, I like to see more in a game like this- the combat and maps were ""ok,"" look to games like Blackguards 2 for an example of more complex maps and character development- overall the game was too simple.  I don't mean easy, but simple.  There wasn't enough depth to the game, story, characters, etc, to keep me playing and committed.  It just wasn't quite fun enough.			"

												ok so first off the game is not perfect. No game is, thats just how it goes. The combat is frustrating for the wrong reasons, the economy is decent but not very deep, and the story telling is good at somepoints and passable at others. However none of the aspects of this game should be considered bad but rather not as good as it could be. The combat is in my opinion to worst part of the game and even then it is better than some games ive had the misfortune to play. The combat can be clunky and slow and the AI can be downright stupid at times, welcome to turn based strategy combat systems, they tend to be this way, the combat does get better asthe game goes on and new weapons and characters are available to you but it never really becomes your favorite part of the game. The economy is better, in my expierience the economy is by no means a deep system. It does not get effected by your actions in the story, it does not change much at all with the exception of a few missions and buildings. However the game seams to encourage you to expiriment with the economy, it is fun to make it a goal to sqeeze as much out of each part of the city you visit, change up what you have in an area as you go through the mission in order to increase profits, decrease your heat and change with number of independent businesses slowly decreasing ad the number of friendly faces going away as they are used up. In one city run a fear based bussiness in the form of protection rackets, pawnshops and gunnrunners. In another work with the populace in the form of a soupkitchen and speakeasy setup. My point is expirement with it. The game gives you a limited number of slots to build with inn each different map, find a wa to make it fun and take everything you can from each place you visit.Finally there is the story. It not the best mafia story out their but lets be honest when was the last good mafia story since the godfather movies. The story has its ups and downs butit does not make or break the game. In my opinion it beats mafia three on its repetitive nature and story. In any case i would say that if you are looking for a game that can be enjoyable and give a slightly realistic powertrip youve come to the right place. just dont look for the best and you should be satisfied. Just a quick end note, If you can, get the gae on sale with DLC. Its the best way to do it.			"

												I originally bought this game, thinking it would be like a mix of Gangsters: Organized Crime with a bit of X-Com-lite turned based game, and have to say I'm disappointed.Pros: It looks nice, the interface is easy to play with and it does invoke the era you're playing in and the base building is actually a nice litte touch that gives the players a sense of progress beyond watching the numbers go up.Cons: As many reviews noted, the combat system heavily favors the AI - your henchmen can't hit for beans, and statuses such as bleeding seem to proc way more often when the computer is using it. It is challenging, but not in a way that feels fair. Add to the limited amount of maps you play on, the fights become grueling slogs of same old same old. The sim section is incredibly easy, especially if you played other management or sim games before and there is not a whole lot of variety - you're basically almost entirely doing some form of rumrunning. In the aforementioned Gangsters (A game released in the 90s), you had a much larger variety of illegal activity such as gambling, teamsters, and smuggling and pairing appropriate fronts with illegal activities for maximum profit and minimum visibility is part of the game play. In Omerta, you know exactly where these things are placed, it's just a matter of buying and pumping money in to run errands.I had very little issues with rising heat, as bribery is too easy a fix for it and as I found combat frustrating and sloggish, I don't actively seek out extras (which is the main source of heat).There's stages where I've literally bought illegal enterprise, maxed out the safe house, and did all the story objectives so it ends up being a matter of waiting for my cash flow to hit the goal.And the stages all have the same general flow: Fight some rival mobs > Buy some distilleries and Speakeases > run errands  > couple more combat maps > buy more land, maybe bribe someone > wait for money.  It's not a terrible game, but a very repetitive one that isn't worth $20 (And as people stated, the DLCs are not worth $5), if   you're still curious, I would highly recommend getting it on sale.

												I think this game would have been a lot more fun if they had done the fights more of a tropico style. Going in to manually control your guys for each little battle gets to become an annoyance. I really want to just be a mob boss but instead I'm leading these guys into battle over a spilled beer crate. If my boss ran around gunning people without my help that's when it would be cool, sadly the auto resolve button for fights just ends up with you dying or winning with someone in jail or injured.
