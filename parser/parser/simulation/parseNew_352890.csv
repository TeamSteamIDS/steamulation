												Overall Game Score: 5/10The game is okay. It takes the genre of party survival to the Arab peninsular. You have to manage a single resource of water, and face not-so-random encounters along the way. The game looks nice and the soundtrack is also very nice for the first few hours. The biggest flaws with this game are the mechanics for battles, its basically a rock-paper-scissor (with some additional boosts) where the opponent AI is absolutely garbage, to the point where every fight you will be geniuinly annoyed at the incompetence. Its simple... You either lose because you are outleveled or you crush your opponent because you are higher. And there are a few exploitable parts of the fight you can use also to ensure you do not take damage on the final round of a battle. Only got to the end of chapter two as it got super repetitive, and I doubted that anything of interest would follow. Not sure if I can recommend buying this.  "

												3 chapters into the game now and I'm really enjoying it. The art-style and the music create a wonderful atmospheric oriental world to explore, and the gameplay has a decelerated and relaxing effect. I enjoy watching my caravan get ready for the journey, taking breaks on the road, meeting strangers, merchants and various creatures, browsing and selecting goods at the bazaars and also help people life and survive in the harsh desert of the Arabian Peninsula.With the random events during the time you are traveling, you never know if you reach your destination unharmed. And always, that's ALWAYS, check your water supplies before leaving a city! I would love to have some kind of transaction log, though. If you always trade low to mid, or low/mid to high you will make a profit, but it would be nice to check back on how much you paid for a specific good.Regarding the fights, it sometimes feels like the API is to stupid to play well, or your opponents are to weak/strong, but I think it would be exactly like that in our world. You never know who you encounter and what he or she is doing.If you like to play a slow paced, relaxing game within and oriental setting, go for it. This game is may be not for you, if you're a hardcore player who searches for the next big challenge.			"

												Uhhh I like it. Played for a while now and really got into the unique and nice atmosphere. For me, a game needs to deliver immersion through a great feeling, and Caravan definitely has that. If you like getting immersed into another world, and just play along with a steady flow, it's a game for you. For me, it's much like Windward and Sunless Sea - I like these kinda old school-ish games that deliver a certain relaxed feeling while challenging you more and more. I also like how they set up the many towns you can explore a little bit different each time, and the easy trading system that let's you play randomly and just enjoy the atmosphere. "

												So I got this game as it was recommended for liking The Long Dark. Being that I was lacking an economically-focused survivalesque game I chose to purchase this.Frankly, the game becomes very simple to beat, not just because you can grind your way to victory (as all markets may go), but that the true randomness of the game is lacking. Every farm you'll come across will have a man begging you to buy 2 wheat for 30 drachma (always a good deal), every cave will either have nothing, 1 hides (3 with a sage sometimes), or 3-4 Ghouls. Merchants will always fake having a broken down cart just to backstab you. Also, Scouts get you free horses, so much so that you begin wishing you could SELL horses.I'd be happier if the game came with an (unlockable or not) endless mode that could amp up the difficulty, not in the combat or the haggling (that's very binary to begin with), but with the world itself. Auxiliaries bring next to nothing to the table for needing to beat the game (get at least one for your Sage if you want free heals and you're set.) The storyline is short, and that's fine, although it happened very suddenly, and with very little information or understanding.The point is, I enjoyed this game for what it brought, more than what it failed to bring, but feel it's not worth $13 (let alone $15 when it's not on sale). I'd like to see the developers work on this game more to justify the price, and to perhaps bring up replayability.			"

YouTube™ Video: Caravan Gameplay - Part 1 - Walkthrough (PC HD)

			Caravan · Part 1 · PC · Gameplay · Walkthrough · Let's Play Caravan Steam Game Playthrough: http://store.steampowered.com/app/352890/ Caravan GOG Game Download: https://www.gog.com/game/caravan...		

Primary goal is to build up your caravan while trying to survive the wilds of Arabia. Prologue starts off quite slow, as shown in the video above. Personally felt a bit lost after the intro as there was no primary quest marked to progress. Just needed to guess which left me feeling somewhat disconnected from the story. Ultimately not a bad thing as it's less linear and more about how much time you want to take accumulating fortunes.Each town holds different npcs, all of them have traders and a place to fill your water. Guildmasters are located in larger cities where you can level up or buy new slaves and companions. Values on trade items change over time but after a playing a while it's easy enough to figure out which items trade best along with where to buy and sell them. After much trekking back and forward trading goods, dealing with fresh produce decaying and keeping my water levels up while fending of random bandit attacks, I've made it to chapter 2, Huzzah! Onwards Soldier!Visuals are lovely, soundtrack was fitting and I had no issues with performance. Game is all mouse driven so there are no controls to remap. SFX can be adjusted separately. 4k res wouldn't display but 1440p seemed to work fine. Overall I'm giving it a thumbs up, just be aware there are other games out there that give a similar experience, some of which are free. It's not really doing anything new with the formula but it's polished product none the less. Cheers.			"

												I just finished the game. Granted, it is a simple game to play, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The combat/haggling is easy -good  for someone who isn't into hack & slash tactics. I absolutely ADORED the system of trade -very easy. For someone like me who is fascinated by all things Arab, the game is almost a godsend. If you like easy games and like games based on trading, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!!! I will definitely will play it again in the near future. I rate it a 9.5 out of 10.			"

												I've so far got 4 hours into the game, I'm enjoying it, but I've got a feeling, and other reviews bear this out, that I've seen most of the surprises the game offers.There are certain events that after the 3rd time you realize that it's the same thing over and over, on the one side that means you can make the right choices when presented with an option, but it's a bit of a shame you know you're not going to be presented additional challenges down the road.FYI, never help a wandering merchant, and the wandering merchants saying they have great deals are actually trying to screw you over, don't buy anything from them, only sell.It's a peaceful experience, not generally very exciting, and certainly has a lot of places it could be more impressive, but I still find it is an enjoyable experience.

												Caravan is a game with a very fresh ""oriental"" setting and some interesting mechanics which tie naturally into its storytelling approach.

												I liked the game, it offers a nice and simple mixture of several genres - some rpg elements, trading and strategy. At first glance it reminded me of FTL, though turned out to be much less rogue like and more centered around the trading aspect. Summary - you are a bit of a spoiled son and your father wants you to help with family business - so he sends you out into the world of arabia with a Caravan, urging you to learn all you can about trading etc. Later, a catastrophy forces you to use your newly gained knowledge... (no spoilers)Positive-In general I like the overall style and graphics-Interesting setting-Nice Story & AtmossphereNegative-Trading was a bit too simplified for my taste-Can be repetetive at some point-Interface can be a bit difficult to navigate in the beginng			"

												I can recommend it if you don't expect too much. I've been playing for about 3 hours now. There's a little bit of story, most of the time you go from town to town, buy stuff, sell stuff. It's not very complicated. The game goes pretty slow; you have to move around a lot to have enough money you need for some actions that are necessary to move further in the story. The fighting system in my opinion is the worst part. It's just plain boring and most of the time it's clear you have no chance, but there are fights you have to do. So you wander around buy goods, sell goods. You look at the map: OK, here these goods are cheap, here they are expensive. O, another thing: You seem to be the only caravan around. So you can be wandering around forever; sometimes you read the message, the traders have new goods, but where? You bought everything that was cheap in one town, return after many days, the map says these goods are still cheap. But, you can't buy any, you bought them all a while ago. Then the traders often don't have enough money. That's realistic in some way; but one trader in one town? Why? As you see, I wanted to write a review recommending the game, but the longer I think about it: I don't know if I should recommend it at all. Because I will continue playing, I will do: recommend it for those of you that don't expect too much.			"

												Simply put this is a great game and although it does have some flaws I'd still recommend it. Why? Because it reminds me of both Taipei and Drug Wars in so many ways, and if you remember these old games you'll know exactly what I'm talking about, and if you loved them you'll certainly like Caravan...So let's get into the pros and cons...PROS:- The graphics, considering the style of game, are good although simplistic;- The sound track is awesome- The game reminds me of the old game Taipei, and if you still remember Taipei and you enjoyed that then you'll enjoy this- The user interface is easy to useCONS:- The combat mechanics, which is a nice idea, needs to be implemented with more complexity along with a major improvement in the AI tactics behind it.- The random events when moving between towns need to be more random and the user to be forced to take more combat actions as opposed to the ability to avoid combat 95% of the time.That said, the combat system does work and so does the events that come up, I'd just prefer further complexity inside both.

Still stuck in the middle of the interessting story campaign I already like where this is going.I love the roleplay/strategy mix and enjoyed playing games like Oregon Trail years before. Nice to see something like this on Steam again.The whole managing part about trading goods, caravan members, animals and water through the Arabic desert gives a neat, but not overloaded mechanic to the game, while following the mysterious storyline.The combat/bargaining mechanic is broken down to an advanced rock/paper/scissors version with dices. This works out quite well, but often shows you the boundaries of your own powers. Since you can't just easily win against any trained merchant or a group of enemies larger than your own I found myself loosing to them pretty often in the beginning.Guess this is, how the world works though. A lot of people didn't liked this too much, but personally I think limitation gives an atmospheric level to the game here. Not being the all-mighty hero, but some random dude, trying to survive in the gigantic destert, undetermined about his future, his family and the water ressources of his own caravan.Since the complete journey is packed with random encounters from this and/or other worlds the game leaves you in consitstens feel about danger and suspense. Taking risks is mostly up to you here.Most likely a personal flavor. But since the game lets you save so often I didn't mind any of this at all.The art style reminds me of some kind of animated mural. If you read fairytales from the 1001 Arabian nights you will probably be remembering those consistantly during the game. The atmospheric background music helps here too, as well as the general pacing of your caravan moving over the screen contributes to the overall mood of the game.Only the interface isn't all perfect in the game and sometimes feels a little bit too oldschool for me. But you get used to it quickly.If you like going your own way with your caravan and try to survive in the hostile desert, I can definitly recommend this game. You will definitely find yourself an Arabian challange here.So if you excuse me now.. I need to open up a caravanserai in my home town. Only for the sake of the word.			"

												While I like the premise a lot, the game falls flat in many ways.After playing couple of hours, I've noticed that actual trading isn't in a big role at all. You make much more profit from random combat encounters and quests.The combat system is simple, and the AI is bad, or even worse, nonexistent. The combat is boring as it is, there's a shared pool of dice that you use to boost your combat stats that are compared to opponent's combat stats. AI doesn't even try to win though, it just picks dice completely randomly. It doesn't take the objectively better dice at all, just a random one.You have henchmen that you link to your chosen heroes that boost their abilities and stats. However, if you want you can use an ability that gets boosted by having a henchman (For example main character has an ability that reduces water consumption for 5% per henchman), then trade that henchman to another hero and do the same. I avoided doing that, but the fact that it's possible shows how little thought the system has been given, at least in my opinion.Also if you have henchmen linked to your fighter (You only ever fight with 1 character and if you lose it's game over. Dumb I know) you instantly lose them if you take even 1 hit point of damage in combat. It happens very easily even if you win, so I pretty much had to keep zero henchmen linked to my main character, or I'd just lose them easily.Even in my 2 hours of play, I encountered the same random event (A salt merchant) at least 5 times, if not more. Most other events I saw like 2 or 3 times. Gets very boring very fast.That said the plot is quite interesting, but the gameplay is just too boring, repetitive and random for me to continue the game.			"

												I might be biased, as I love the Oriental setting (in games like Anno 1404 for example as well, as well as in Aladdin), but I really enjoyed this game. Sure it becomes a grind at some point, but you're working towards a goal of avenging the tragedy that overcame your parents/hometown, as well as trying to become the best caravan trader possibly. Your caravan grows slowly but surely.The fight-system is also kinda fun at first, but later on you discover the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that you can win easily. Also there's not much difference between regions except the products. There could be more depth into the game. Make the grind less present, and introduce things like competing caravan traders, or cartels, or more dealings with djins and Oriental culture. Or some kind of empire building featuresBut it's a game. And therefore it will keep having it's limitations. The end wasn't very satisfactory either to be honest. But overall I consider this game to be worth it's money.If I could give the devs some advice, then it would be to look at the game Turmoil. It started out with a simple concept too, yet they expanded functions and additions greatly.			"

The travels are sometimes interrupted by random encounters: help someone, fight critters, take a moral decission, investigate a cave, ...The encounters have simplified gameplay and as of that loosen up the travels without disturbing the trading aspect of the game.Last but not least the game seems to have an interesting storyline too, at least from what i can tell after 1h into the game.
